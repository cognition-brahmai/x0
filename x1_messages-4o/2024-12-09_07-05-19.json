I want to implement a mechanism to retry the transaction up to three times when this error occurs. I have started to write a decorator that does this but I am unsure how to save the session state before the failure and retry the same transaction after it as SQLAlchemy requires a rollback whenever an exception is raised. Can you assist me with this?"

        "content": "Certainly! Implementing a retry mechanism for handling deadlocks in SQLAlchemy can be quite useful. Here's a basic version of a decorator that retries a transaction up to three times when a deadlock error is encountered. This will involve rolling back the transaction on encountering the error and then retrying it.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom functools import wraps\nfrom sqlalchemy.exc import OperationalError\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\nimport time\n\n# Define your retry decorator\ndef retry_on_deadlock(retries=3, delay=1):\n    def decorator(func):\n        @wraps(func)\n        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            attempt = 0\n            while attempt < retries:\n                try:\n                    return func(*args, **kwargs)\n                except OperationalError as e:\n                    if \"1213\" in str(e.orig):\n                        print(f\"Deadlock encountered. Retrying {attempt + 1}/{retries}...\")\n                        attempt += 1\n                        time.sleep(delay)  # Optional: Add a delay before retrying\n                        # Ensure the session is rolled back before retrying\n                        args[0].rollback()\n                    else:\n                        raise\n            raise Exception(f\"Failed after {retries} attempts due to deadlock.\")\n        return wrapper\n    return decorator\n\n# Example usage\nSession = sessionmaker(bind=your_engine)\nsession = Session()\n\n@retry_on_deadlock(retries=3, delay=1)\ndef your_transaction(session):\n    # Your transaction logic here\n    # Example:\n    # session.add(your_object)\n    # session.commit()\n    pass\n\n# Running the transaction\nyour_transaction(session)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Decorator Function:** `retry_on_deadlock` is a decorator that takes the number of retries and an optional delay between retries as arguments.\n\n2. **OperationalError Check:** The decorator checks if the `OperationalError` is due to a deadlock (error code 1213). If so, it retries the transaction after rolling back the session.\n\n3. **Rollback:** It's important to roll back the session (`args[0].rollback()`) before retrying to ensure that the session state is cleared of any pending changes that caused the deadlock.\n\n4. **Retries and Delay:** The decorator retries the transaction up to the specified number of times, with an optional delay between attempts.\n\n5. **Usage:** Decorate your transaction function with `@retry_on_deadlock`, passing the session as an argument to the function.\n\nThis should help you manage deadlocks more gracefully by retrying the transaction instead of failing immediately. Adjust the retries and delay as needed based on your application's requirements."
