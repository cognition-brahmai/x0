However, I am encountering an issue with the following script:\n\n```python\nfor root, subFolder, files in os.walk(PATH):\n    for item in files:\n        if item.endswith(\".txt\"):\n            fileNamePath = str(os.path.join(root,subFolder,item))\n```\nThe problem is that the `subFolder` variable is returning a list of subfolders, instead of the folder where the target file is located. I am considering running a loop for the subfolder before and joining the first part of the path. However, I would like to know if there is a more efficient way to achieve this."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is due to the misunderstanding of the `os.walk()` function's return values. The `os.walk()` function returns a tuple of three values for each directory it visits: `root`, `dirs`, and `files`. The `root` variable corresponds to the current directory path, `dirs` is a list of subdirectories in the current directory, and `files` is a list of filenames in the current directory.\n\nTherefore, you do not need to use `subFolder` to construct the file path. You should use `root` directly with `os.path.join()` to get the full path of the file. Here's the corrected script:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Replace 'PATH' with the actual path of the directory you want to search\nPATH = 'your_directory_path_here'\n\n# List to store paths of text files\ntxt_files = []\n\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(PATH):\n    for item in files:\n        if item.endswith(\".txt\"):\n            fileNamePath = os.path.join(root, item)\n            txt_files.append(fileNamePath)\n\n# If you want to see the list of text files\nprint(txt_files)\n```\n\nThis script will recursively go through all subfolders in the specified directory, find all files ending with \".txt\", and store their full paths in the `txt_files` list. Make sure to replace `'your_directory_path_here'` with the actual path to the directory you want to search."
