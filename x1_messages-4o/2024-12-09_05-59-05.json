Currently, the function only works for the immediate path provided to it. I am looking for a way to wrap it in a recursive function that enables it to visit all subdirectories beneath the given path."

        "content": "To use `os.scandir()` recursively in Python 3.5 and traverse an entire directory tree, you can create a recursive function that iterates over each directory and its subdirectories. Here\u2019s how you can achieve that:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef scan_directory_recursively(path):\n    try:\n        # Use os.scandir() to iterate over the directory entries in the given path\n        with os.scandir(path) as it:\n            for entry in it:\n                print(entry.path)  # Or process the entry as needed\n\n                # If the entry is a directory, recursively call this function\n                if entry.is_dir(follow_symlinks=False):\n                    scan_directory_recursively(entry.path)\n    except PermissionError:\n        # Handle the case where the program does not have permission to access a directory\n        print(f\"Permission denied: {path}\")\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        # Handle the case where the directory is not found\n        print(f\"Directory not found: {path}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        # Handle other possible exceptions\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n# Example usage:\npath_to_scan = '/your/directory/path'\nscan_directory_recursively(path_to_scan)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **os.scandir()**: This function returns an iterator of `DirEntry` objects corresponding to the entries in the directory given by `path`.\n\n2. **Recursive Function**: The `scan_directory_recursively` function is defined to iterate over each entry in the directory. If an entry is a directory, it calls itself recursively to continue scanning.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: The function includes basic error handling for common exceptions such as `PermissionError` and `FileNotFoundError`, which are useful when dealing with file system operations.\n\n4. **Processing Entries**: You can replace `print(entry.path)` with any processing you need to perform on each file or directory.\n\nThis approach effectively traverses the entire directory tree starting from the specified path, allowing you to process each file and directory as needed."
