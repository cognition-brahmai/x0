The application is supposed to store intellectual assets such as articles, books, etc. However, when I navigate to `/research/`, I encounter an error that says `table 'research_journal' doesn't exist (\"no such table\")`. I am using Django 1.6.5 with a sqlite3 database. Despite running `python manage.py migrate research` and `python manage.py syncdb`, the problem persists. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "It seems like your migrations are not being applied correctly, which is why the table `research_journal` does not exist. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Your Models**: First, ensure that your models are defined correctly in the `research` app's `models.py` file. Make sure there's a model named `Journal` or any other model that corresponds to the `research_journal` table.\n\n2. **Create Migrations**: Since you're using Django 1.6.5, the default migration system (South) must be used, as Django's built-in migration system was introduced in Django 1.7. You might need to ensure that South is properly set up.\n\n    - If South is not installed, you can install it using:\n      ```bash\n      pip install South\n      ```\n\n    - After installing South, create initial migrations for your `research` app:\n      ```bash\n      python manage.py schemamigration research --initial\n      ```\n\n3. **Apply Migrations**: Once the initial migrations are created, you can apply them using:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py migrate research\n   ```\n\n4. **Sync the Database**: In Django 1.6.5, `syncdb` is used to create tables for apps without migrations. Ensure you've run it at least once:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py syncdb\n   ```\n\n5. **Check Installed Apps**: Make sure your `research` app is included in the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting in your `settings.py` file.\n\n6. **Database File**: Double-check that the database file is being accessed correctly. If you're using a relative path in `settings.py`, make sure it points to the correct location.\n\n7. **Clear Old Migrations**: If there are any old migration files that might be causing conflicts, consider deleting them and re-running the migration creation and application steps.\n\n8. **Check for Errors**: Look for any errors or warnings in the console output when running the commands. They might give you hints on what's going wrong.\n\nIf you've gone through these steps and the problem persists, there might be a specific issue with your setup or database. You could also consider upgrading to a newer version of Django if possible, as it has a more robust migration framework built-in."
