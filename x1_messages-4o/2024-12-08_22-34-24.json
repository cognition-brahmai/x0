Here\u2019s how you can structure the data and logic:\n\n1. **Books and their Details**:\n   - **Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone**: Fantasy, Published in 1997\n   - **A Game of Thrones**: Fantasy, Published in 1996\n   - **Frankenstein**: Horror, Published in 1818\n\n2. **Guidelines for Recommendation**:\n   - For Fantasy, recommend the most recently published book.\n   - For Horror, recommend the oldest book.\n\n3. **Data Structure**:\n   - Use a dictionary to hold the genres, recommended books, and all books.\n\nHere's the Python code to generate the desired output:\n\n```python\nbooks = [\n    {\"title\": \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\", \"genre\": \"Fantasy\", \"publication_year\": 1997},\n    {\"title\": \"A Game of Thrones\", \"genre\": \"Fantasy\", \"publication_year\": 1996},\n    {\"title\": \"Frankenstein\", \"genre\": \"Horror\", \"publication_year\": 1818}\n]\n\n# Organize books by genre\nbooks_by_genre = {}\nfor book in books:\n    genre = book[\"genre\"]\n    if genre not in books_by_genre:\n        books_by_genre[genre] = []\n    books_by_genre[genre].append(book)\n\n# Prepare the output\noutput = {}\nfor genre, book_list in books_by_genre.items():\n    if genre == \"Fantasy\":\n        # Recommend the most recent book\n        recommended = max(book_list, key=lambda x: x[\"publication_year\"])\n    elif genre == \"Horror\":\n        # Recommend the oldest book\n        recommended = min(book_list, key=lambda x: x[\"publication_year\"])\n    \n    output[genre] = {\n        \"recommended_books\": [recommended[\"title\"]],\n        \"all_books\": [book[\"title\"] for book in book_list]\n    }\n\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis script will output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Fantasy\": {\n    \"recommended_books\": [\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\"],\n    \"all_books\": [\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\", \"A Game of Thrones\"]\n  },\n  \"Horror\": {\n    \"recommended_books\": [\"Frankenstein\"],\n    \"all_books\": [\"Frankenstein\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis output matches your requirement by recommending the most recent Fantasy book and the oldest Horror book while listing all books in each genre."
