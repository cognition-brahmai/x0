This frustration is compounded by the varying gas prices across different states and regions in the United States. To better understand these variations, we present a comprehensive table that details gas prices by state and region. This table can serve as a useful reference for those looking to manage their commuting expenses more effectively.\n\n### Table: Gas Prices by State and Region\n| State        | Region        | Gas Price (USD/Gallon) |\n|--------------|---------------|------------------------|\n| California   | West Coast    | 4.20                   |\n| Texas        | Southwest     | 3.50                   |\n| New York     | Northeast     | 3.90                   |\n| Florida      | Southeast     | 3.60                   |\n| Illinois     | Midwest       | 3.80                   |\n\n### Code Snippet: Calculating Average Monthly Gas Expenditure\nTo assist individuals in budgeting their monthly gas expenses, the following Python code snippet calculates the average monthly gas expenditure for each state. This calculation is based on the current gas prices and the average daily commute distance specific to each state.\n\n```python\n# Average daily commute distance in miles for each state\naverage_commute_distance = {\n    'California': 30,\n    'Texas': 25,\n    'New York': 20,\n    'Florida': 22,\n    'Illinois': 28\n}\n\n# Gas prices per gallon in each state\ngas_prices = {\n    'California': 4.20,\n    'Texas': 3.50,\n    'New York': 3.90,\n    'Florida': 3.60,\n    'Illinois': 3.80\n}\n\ndef calculate_monthly_gas_expenditure(state, daily_commute, gas_price_per_gallon):\n    # Assume 22 workdays per month\n    monthly_commute_miles = daily_commute * 22\n    # Assume a vehicle fuel efficiency of 25 miles per gallon\n    gallons_used = monthly_commute_miles / 25\n    return gallons_used * gas_price_per_gallon\n\n# Calculate and display the monthly expenditure for each state\nfor state in gas_prices:\n    expenditure = calculate_monthly_gas_expenditure(state, average_commute_distance[state], gas_prices[state])\n    print(f\"Average monthly gas expenditure in {state}: ${expenditure:.2f}\")\n```\n\n### Spanish Paragraph: Impacto de los Altos Precios del Gas\nLos altos precios del gas tienen un impacto significativo en la econom\u00eda y el medio ambiente. A medida que el costo del combustible aumenta, los gastos de transporte tambi\u00e9n se elevan, afectando la econom\u00eda personal y nacional. Adem\u00e1s, el uso excesivo de veh\u00edculos personales contribuye a la contaminaci\u00f3n del aire y al cambio clim\u00e1tico. Para mitigar estos efectos, es importante que los individuos consideren el uso de modos de transporte alternativos como bicicletas, transporte p\u00fablico o compartir el autom\u00f3vil con otros. Estas acciones no solo ayudan a reducir la huella de carbono, sino que tambi\u00e9n ofrecen un alivio econ\u00f3mico al disminuir la dependencia de los combustibles f\u00f3siles.\n\nBy incorporating these additional constraints and inputs, individuals can gain a more comprehensive understanding of their commuting expenses and explore alternatives to mitigate the impact of rising gas prices on their daily lives."
