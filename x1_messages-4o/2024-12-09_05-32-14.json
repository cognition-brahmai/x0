I want a timer to start at the beginning of the program and when it reaches 10 seconds, it should perform a certain action, such as exiting a loop. How can I implement this?"

        "content": "To implement a timer in your game that performs an action after 10 seconds, you can use Python's `time` module to keep track of the elapsed time. Here's a simple example of how you could structure your game loop to incorporate this timer:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef game():\n    start_time = time.time()  # Record the start time\n    time_limit = 10  # Time limit in seconds\n    \n    blocks_collected = 0\n\n    while True:\n        # Calculate the elapsed time\n        elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time\n        \n        # Check if the time limit has been reached\n        if elapsed_time >= time_limit:\n            print(\"Time's up!\")\n            break\n        \n        # Simulate collecting blocks\n        user_input = input(\"Press 'c' to collect a block or 'q' to quit: \")\n        \n        if user_input.lower() == 'c':\n            blocks_collected += 1\n            print(f\"Blocks collected: {blocks_collected}\")\n        elif user_input.lower() == 'q':\n            print(\"Game exited by the user.\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid input, try again.\")\n\n    print(f\"Total blocks collected: {blocks_collected}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    game()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Start Time**: The `start_time` variable is initialized with the current time using `time.time()`, which gives the current time in seconds since the epoch.\n\n2. **Game Loop**: The `while True` loop represents the game loop, which will keep running until the time limit is reached or the user decides to quit.\n\n3. **Elapsed Time**: During each iteration, `elapsed_time` is calculated by subtracting `start_time` from the current time.\n\n4. **Time Check**: If `elapsed_time` exceeds the `time_limit` of 10 seconds, a message is printed, and the loop is exited using `break`.\n\n5. **User Input**: Inside the loop, the user is prompted to press 'c' to collect blocks or 'q' to quit. The number of blocks collected is incremented if 'c' is pressed.\n\n6. **Exit Conditions**: The loop will break either when the time is up or if the user presses 'q'.\n\nThis example provides a basic framework for incorporating a timer in your game. You can expand upon it to include more game logic and features as needed."
