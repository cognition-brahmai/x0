My code is:\n\n```python\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n...\n\nsns.set_style(\"whitegrid\")\nax = sns.barplot(x=range(1,11), y=[ (x/nrows)*100 for x in addr_pop ], palette=\"Blues_d\")\nax.savefig(\"html/addr_depth.png\")\n```\n\nThe variables are populated as expected, and I get a great-looking chart in iPyNB. However, when I run the code within a script, I get a `RuntimeError: Invalid DISPLAY variable`. I tried to solve this by adding the following to the top of my script:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib\nmatplotlib.use('Agg')\n```\n\nAfter this change, I seem to be encountering an issue where the `savefig()` method is not available for the plot at all. The error message I receive is `AttributeError: 'AxesSubplot' object has no attribute 'savefig'`. All the results I found while searching for this error are related to pandas and a plot that is already being displayed. I just want Seaborn to output the fig to a file without displaying it at all. Can you help me resolve this issue?"

        "content": "Certainly! The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that `savefig()` is a method of the `Figure` object, not the `AxesSubplot` object. Here's how you can modify your code to save the plot as a PNG file:\n\n1. First, ensure that you've imported `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`.\n2. Use `plt.savefig()` to save the figure.\n\nHere's how you can adjust your code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib\nmatplotlib.use('Agg')  # Use a non-interactive backend\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Your data preparation code here\n\nsns.set_style(\"whitegrid\")\nax = sns.barplot(x=range(1, 11), y=[(x/nrows)*100 for x in addr_pop], palette=\"Blues_d\")\n\n# Save the plot\nplt.savefig(\"html/addr_depth.png\")\n\n# Optionally, close the plot to free up memory\nplt.close()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **matplotlib.use('Agg')**: You have correctly set the backend to 'Agg', which is a non-interactive backend suitable for saving figures to files.\n- **plt.savefig()**: Use this function to save the current figure to a file. It should be called after all plotting commands.\n- **plt.close()**: This is optional but recommended to free up resources, especially if you're generating multiple plots in a loop.\n\nBy following these steps, your plot should be saved as a PNG file without attempting to display it."
