        "content": "In the given text, \"He was sad to leave his hometown, but happy to start a new chapter,\" we can identify two emotions: sadness and happiness. \n\nThe primary emotion is the dominant feeling, which seems to be happiness, as the text ends on a positive note with the excitement of starting a new chapter. The way the sentence is structured suggests that the anticipation of the new beginning is the focal point.\n\nThe suppressed emotion, on the other hand, is sadness. Although it is mentioned first, it appears to be subdued or overshadowed by the excitement and positivity of the new opportunity, indicating that it is the less dominant emotion in this context."
