        "content": "Certainly! Let's troubleshoot the issue step by step:\n\n1. **Verify Cython Installation:**\n   - First, ensure that Cython is installed in the Python environment you're using. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\n     ```\n     pip show Cython\n     ```\n   - This command will display information about the Cython package if it's installed. If it's not installed, you can try reinstalling it using:\n     ```\n     pip install Cython\n     ```\n\n2. **Check Python Path:**\n   - Make sure that the Python environment where you installed Cython is the same one you're using to run your scripts. Sometimes multiple Python installations can cause confusion.\n   - You can check the Python version and path by running:\n     ```\n     python --version\n     which python  # On Unix-based systems\n     where python  # On Windows\n     ```\n\n3. **Python Environment:**\n   - If you're using a virtual environment, ensure it's activated before running your script or installing packages. Activate it using:\n     ```\n     source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix-based systems\n     .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate   # On Windows\n     ```\n\n4. **Check for Typos:**\n   - Double-check that there are no typos in your import statement or in the module name.\n\n5. **Reinstall Cython:**\n   - Sometimes, reinstalling the package can resolve issues. Uninstall Cython and then reinstall it:\n     ```\n     pip uninstall Cython\n     pip install Cython\n     ```\n\n6. **Check for System Path Issues:**\n   - Ensure that the directory containing Python's executables is in your system's PATH environment variable.\n\n7. **Run Python from Command Prompt:**\n   - Sometimes IDEs or editors have their own settings. Try running your script directly from the command prompt or terminal to see if the problem persists.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue. If the problem persists, please let me know any specific error messages or behavior you're experiencing, and we can explore further solutions."
