        "content": "To convert prices from USD to CAD in your Excel table, you'll need the current exchange rate. You can use a formula in Excel once you have the conversion rate, or use MATLAB code if you prefer. Additionally, there are online services that provide currency exchange rates via JSON or XML.\n\n### Excel Formula\nAssuming the exchange rate is stored in cell `B1` and your prices in USD are in column `A`, you can use the following formula in column `B` to convert USD to CAD:\n\n```excel\n=B1 * A2\n```\n\nDrag this formula down alongside your list of products.\n\n### MATLAB Code\nIf you prefer to use MATLAB, you can use the following code snippet to convert USD to CAD:\n\n```matlab\n% Assuming prices in USD are stored in an array\npricesInUSD = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]; % Example prices\nexchangeRate = 1.34; % Example exchange rate from USD to CAD\n\n% Convert prices to CAD\npricesInCAD = pricesInUSD * exchangeRate;\n\ndisp(pricesInCAD);\n```\n\nReplace `exchangeRate` with the current rate.\n\n### Retrieving Exchange Rate via JSON or XML\n#### JSON\nYou can use an API like Open Exchange Rates or CurrencyLayer to get the current exchange rate. Here\u2019s a basic example of how you might retrieve this data in MATLAB using the `webread` function:\n\n```matlab\nurl = 'https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/USD'; % Replace with your preferred API\ndata = webread(url);\nexchangeRate = data.rates.CAD;\n```\n\n#### XML\nFor XML, you can use a similar approach:\n\n```matlab\nurl = 'https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest'; % Replace with your preferred API\ndata = webread(url);\nexchangeRate = data.rates.CAD;\n```\n\nMake sure to check the terms of use for the API you choose, as many require an API key or have usage limits."
