I've tried the solution `\\s+[^\\n]` from this [source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14190038/regex-match-space-not-n), but it doesn't seem to work correctly with my example code:\n\n```python\na='rasd\\nsa sd'\nprint(re.search(r'\\s+[^ \\n]',a))\n```\n\nThe result I get is `<_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(4, 6), match='\\ns'>`, which is the newline matched, not the whitespace."

        "content": "To match exactly a whitespace character in Python using regex, while excluding newline (`\\n`) and tab (`\\t`) characters, you need to specify the space character explicitly in your regex pattern. Using `\\s` will include `\\n`, `\\t`, and other whitespace characters, which is not what you want.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\na = 'rasd\\nsa sd'\nmatch = re.search(r' [^\\n\\t]', a)\nif match:\n    print(match)\nelse:\n    print(\"No match found\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `r' [^\\n\\t]'`: This pattern explicitly looks for a space character followed by any character that is not a newline or a tab.\n- The space character is matched literally.\n- `[^\\n\\t]` is a character class that matches any character that is not a newline `\\n` or tab `\\t`.\n\nThis pattern should correctly match only the space character in your string and ensure that newline and tab characters are excluded."
