Below is the code I have been working on, where my dataset uses X['train'] as input and y['train'] as output. I have trained the model and now I want to save it in a folder. What is the correct format to save my model in a folder named 'saved_model'? Additionally, I want to be able to load this model later in other code. Is there a function to import the saved model from the file? I tried finding examples for tf.contrib.learn.Estimator.export_savedmodel but did not have much success. \n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.contrib import learn\nfrom tensorflow.contrib.learn.python import SKCompat\n\n# Assume my dataset is using X['train'] as input and y['train'] as output\nregressor = SKCompat(learn.Estimator(model_fn=lstm_model(TIMESTEPS, RNN_LAYERS, DENSE_LAYERS),model_dir=LOG_DIR))\nvalidation_monitor = learn.monitors.ValidationMonitor(X['val'], y['val'], every_n_steps=PRINT_STEPS, early_stopping_rounds=1000)\nregressor.fit(X['train'], y['train'],\n              monitors=[validation_monitor],\n              batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,\n              steps=TRAINING_STEPS)\n\n# After training this model I want to save it in a folder\n# What is the correct format to use here to save my model in a folder called 'saved_model'\nregressor.export_savedmodel('/saved_model/')\n\n# I want to import it later in some other code\n# is there any function like import model from file?\n```"

        "content": "To save and load a TensorFlow model, especially when using an Estimator, you'll typically use the `export_savedmodel` method to save the model and `tf.saved_model.load` to load it later. However, there are some updates needed since TensorFlow 2.x has deprecated `tf.contrib`, and the Estimator API has been adjusted accordingly.\n\nHere's how you can save and load a model using TensorFlow's Estimator API:\n\n### Saving the Model\n\n1. **Define a serving input function**: This function describes how your input data should be transformed to be fed into the model when serving.\n\n2. **Export the model**: Use `export_savedmodel` with the serving input function to save the model.\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.compat.v1 import estimator\n\ndef serving_input_fn():\n    feature_spec = {'feature_name': tf.compat.v1.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32, shape=[None, feature_dimension])}\n    return tf.estimator.export.build_raw_serving_input_receiver_fn(feature_spec)()\n\n# Assuming regressor is your trained Estimator\nfeature_dimension = X['train'].shape[1]  # Adjust this based on your input feature dimension\n\nregressor.export_savedmodel('saved_model', serving_input_fn)\n```\n\n### Loading the Model\n\nTo load the saved model in another script or session, you can use `tf.saved_model.load`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Load the model\nloaded_model = tf.saved_model.load('saved_model')\n\n# To make predictions, you might need to access specific signature functions\ninfer = loaded_model.signatures['serving_default']\n\n# Prepare your input data in the expected format\ninput_data = tf.constant(X['test'], dtype=tf.float32)\n\n# Make predictions\npredictions = infer(input_data)\n```\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- **Ensure TensorFlow version compatibility**: The code above assumes you are working with a TensorFlow version compatible with the Estimator API. Since `tf.contrib` is deprecated, it's recommended to use TensorFlow 2.x.\n\n- **Feature specification**: In `serving_input_fn`, replace `'feature_name'` and `feature_dimension` with the actual feature names and dimensions of your dataset.\n\n- **Model Directory**: Make sure the directory path ('saved_model' in this case) is correct and accessible.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to save and load your TensorFlow Estimator model successfully."
