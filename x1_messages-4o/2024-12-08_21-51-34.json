        "content": "Certainly! Your approach to generating an arithmetic sequence in C# and calculating the sum of the first 10 terms is correct. Here's how you can implement it in C#:\n\n1. **Code to Generate the Arithmetic Sequence and Calculate the Sum:**\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        int a = 6; // First term of the sequence\n        int d = 2; // Common difference\n        int n = 10; // Number of terms\n\n        // Calculate the sum of the first n terms\n        int sum = (n * (2 * a + (n - 1) * d)) / 2;\n        Console.WriteLine(\"The sum of the first \" + n + \" terms of the arithmetic sequence is: \" + sum);\n\n        // Generate and print the sequence\n        Console.WriteLine(\"The arithmetic sequence is:\");\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)\n        {\n            int term = a + i * d;\n            Console.Write(term + \" \");\n        }\n        Console.WriteLine();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2. **Code to Compute the nth Term:**\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        int a = 6; // First term\n        int d = 2; // Common difference\n        int n = 5; // Term number to compute\n\n        // Calculate the nth term\n        int an = a + (n - 1) * d;\n        Console.WriteLine(\"The \" + n + \"th term of the arithmetic sequence is: \" + an);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Arithmetic Sequence Formula:**\n  - The nth term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula: \n    \\[\n    a_n = a + (n - 1) \\times d\n    \\]\n  where \\( a \\) is the first term, \\( d \\) is the common difference, and \\( n \\) is the term number.\n\n- **Sum of First n Terms:**\n  - The sum \\( S_n \\) of the first \\( n \\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is calculated as:\n    \\[\n    S_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (2a + (n - 1) \\times d)\n    \\]\n\nThis code will generate the first 10 terms of the sequence starting at 6 with a common difference of 2, compute their sum, and also find the nth term for any specified \\( n \\)."
