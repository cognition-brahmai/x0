How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To search across both the \"firstname\" and \"lastname\" columns, you can use the `or_` function from SQLAlchemy's `sqlalchemy` module to filter records where either column matches the search criteria. Additionally, you can concatenate the two columns and apply the filter to the combined value. Here's how you can achieve both:\n\n### Using `or_` to Search Either Column\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import or_\n\nquery = meta.Session.query(User).filter(\n    or_(\n        User.firstname.like(searchVar),\n        User.lastname.like(searchVar)\n    )\n)\n```\n\nThis query will return results where either the `firstname` or `lastname` matches the `searchVar`.\n\n### Concatenating Columns and Applying a Filter\n\nIf you want to concatenate the columns and apply the filter to the combined result, you can use SQLAlchemy's `concat` function. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import func\n\nsearchVar = f\"%{searchVar}%\"\nquery = meta.Session.query(User).filter(\n    func.concat(User.firstname, ' ', User.lastname).like(searchVar)\n)\n```\n\nIn this query, `func.concat` is used to concatenate the \"firstname\" and \"lastname\" columns with a space in between, and then `like` is applied to the concatenated result. Note that you should adjust `searchVar` to include wildcards (`%`) as needed for your search logic.\n\nBoth methods are useful depending on whether you want to match either column individually or the combined value of both columns. Adjust `searchVar` accordingly to include wildcards for pattern matching, if necessary."
