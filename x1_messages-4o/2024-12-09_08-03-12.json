I'm fairly new to Python and I've figured out how to get `py.test -f` to watch my tests as I code, but I want a smarter watcher, similar to Ruby's Guard library. When using guard + minitest, if I save a file like `my_class.rb` then `my_class_test.rb` is executed, and if I hit `enter` in the CLI, it runs all tests. Can I replicate this behavior in Python with pytest to avoid running the entire test suite every time until the current file passes?"

        "content": "To achieve the behavior you are looking for with `pytest`, you can use a combination of tools and scripting to create a smart test-watching setup similar to Ruby's Guard library. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can implement this:\n\n### Step 1: Watch for File Changes\n\nYou can use a file-watching tool like `watchdog` to monitor changes in your project directory. You'll need to write a small script to detect the last modified file and trigger the corresponding test file.\n\nFirst, install `watchdog`:\n\n```bash\npip install watchdog\n```\n\n### Step 2: Create a Mapping Between Source Files and Test Files\n\nAssume you have a convention where the test file is named similarly to the source file, e.g., `my_class.py` corresponds to `test_my_class.py`. You can write a script that maps these files:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport time\nfrom watchdog.observers import Observer\nfrom watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler\nimport subprocess\n\nclass ChangeHandler(FileSystemEventHandler):\n    def on_modified(self, event):\n        # Ignore directories\n        if event.is_directory:\n            return\n        \n        # Get the modified file path\n        file_path = event.src_path\n\n        # Deduce the test file from the modified file\n        if file_path.endswith('.py') and not file_path.startswith('test_'):\n            dir_name, file_name = os.path.split(file_path)\n            test_file_name = 'test_' + file_name\n            test_file_path = os.path.join(dir_name, test_file_name)\n\n            # Check if the test file exists\n            if os.path.exists(test_file_path):\n                # Run the test file using pytest\n                print(f\"Running tests in {test_file_path}...\")\n                subprocess.run(['pytest', test_file_path])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    path = \".\"  # Watch the current directory\n    event_handler = ChangeHandler()\n    observer = Observer()\n    observer.schedule(event_handler, path, recursive=True)\n    observer.start()\n\n    try:\n        while True:\n            time.sleep(1)\n    except KeyboardInterrupt:\n        observer.stop()\n    observer.join()\n```\n\n### Step 3: Extend Functionality for Running All Tests\n\nYou can enhance the script to listen for a specific keypress (like Enter) to run all tests in the suite:\n\n```python\nimport threading\nimport sys\n\ndef listen_for_enter():\n    while True:\n        if input() == '':\n            print(\"Running all tests...\")\n            subprocess.run(['pytest'])\n\n# Start a separate thread to listen for Enter key\nthreading.Thread(target=listen_for_enter, daemon=True).start()\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Save the script as `test_watcher.py`.\n2. Run the script: `python test_watcher.py`.\n3. Modify your Python source files. The corresponding test file will automatically be run.\n4. Press Enter in the terminal to run all tests.\n\n### Notes\n\n- This script assumes that your test files are in the same directory as the source files. You may need to adjust the logic if your project structure is different.\n- Ensure that your test naming convention is consistent for the script to map source files to test files correctly.\n- You can further enhance this script by adding logging, error handling, or more complex file mapping if needed.\n\nThis setup mimics the behavior you described and provides a flexible test-watching solution for your Python projects."
