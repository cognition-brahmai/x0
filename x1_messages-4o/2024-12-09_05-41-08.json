I have a `familyName` attribute in the `Family` class and I want to access this attribute from an object of the `Person` class. \n\nGiven the following code:\n\n```python\nclass Family(object):\n    def __init__(self, familyName):\n        self.familyName = familyName\n\nclass Person(Family):\n    def __init__(self, personName):\n        self.personName = personName\n\nstrauss = Family('Strauss')\njohaness = Person('Johaness')\nrichard = Person('Richard')\n```\n\nI want to be able to do something like `print richard.familyName` and get the output as `'Strauss'`. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To achieve this, you need to ensure that the `Person` class initializes the `Family` class properly, inheriting its attributes. However, in your current setup, each `Person` instance does not have a `familyName` attribute because the `__init__` method in the `Person` class does not call the `__init__` method of the `Family` class. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nclass Family(object):\n    def __init__(self, familyName):\n        self.familyName = familyName\n\nclass Person(Family):\n    def __init__(self, personName, familyName):\n        super().__init__(familyName)  # Initialize the Family class\n        self.personName = personName\n\n# Create an object of the Person class, providing both personName and familyName\nrichard = Person('Richard', 'Strauss')\n\n# Access the familyName attribute from the Person instance\nprint(richard.familyName)  # Output: 'Strauss'\n```\n\nIn this updated version:\n\n1. The `Person` class's `__init__` method takes both `personName` and `familyName` as arguments.\n2. The `super().__init__(familyName)` call initializes the `Family` class, setting the `familyName` attribute for the `Person` instance.\n3. When you create a `Person` object, you provide both the `personName` and the `familyName`.\n\nThis allows you to access the `familyName` attribute directly from a `Person` instance."
