        "content": "I am using Keras and TensorFlow for classifying aerial imagery which is tiled into 256x256 tiles. The model I am using splits the training data into 70% training data and 30% validation data. It uses a sequential model followed by an image data generator and a fit generator to fit the model to the data. The model is then saved in h5 format to be used for predicting classes with other imagery in different study areas. When I run the model using the 70%/30% training/validation split, the predictions on the validation images work great. However, when I use the saved h5 model to make predictions on new imagery, the results are nonsensical and appear random for each tile. The probability arrays seem to be shuffled randomly such that when I join the results to the vector image boundary tiles, the results look totally random. Can you help me resolve this issue? Below is the code I used to train the model and the script I used to make predictions on test imagery from a different study area.\n\nCode: \n```\nbase_model = applications.VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(img_rows, img_cols, img_channel))\n\nadd_model = Sequential()\nadd_model.add(Flatten(input_shape=base_model.output_shape[1:]))\nadd_model.add(Dense(256, activation='relu'))\nadd_model.add(Dense(n_classes, activation='sigmoid')) # n classes\n\nmodel = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=add_model(base_model.output))\nmodel.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=optimizers.SGD(lr=1e-4, momentum=0.9),\n              metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n######################\n\nbatch_size = 32\nepochs = 50\n\nprint('Running the image data generator...')\ntrain_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(\n        rotation_range=30, \n        width_shift_range=0.1,\n        height_shift_range=0.1, \n        horizontal_flip=True)\ntrain_datagen.fit(x_train)\n\nprint('Fitting the model...')\nhistory = model.fit_generator(\n    train_datagen.flow(x_train, y_train, batch_size=batch_size),\n    steps_per_epoch=x_train.shape[0] // batch_size,\n    epochs=epochs,\n    #validation_data=(x_valid, y_valid),\n    #callbacks=[ModelCheckpoint(model_checkpoint, monitor='val_acc', save_best_only=True)]\n)\n\n######################\n\n## Predict\n#print('Predicting...')\n#p_valid = model.predict(x_valid, batch_size=128)\n\n## Write predictions to csv\n#print('Saving predictions to CSV...')\n#df = pd.DataFrame(p_valid)\n#df['image'] = split + 1 + df.index \n#df.to_csv(out_csv, index=False, header=False)\n\n\"\"\" \nSave model, including these details:\n-the architecture of the model, allowing to re-create the model\n-the weights of the model\n-the training configuration (loss, optimizer)\n-the state of the optimizer, allowing to resume training exactly where you left off.\n\"\"\"\nprint(\"Saving model\")\nmodel.save(\"/vgg16-model-50epochs.h5\")\n\nprint('Processing complete.')\n```\n\nAnd the following script uses the saved model from above to make predictions on test imagery from a different study area: \n\n```\nimport glob, os, time\nimport cv2\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\nfrom keras.models import load_model\n#from keras.models import model_from_json\n\n# Path to the input tiles which will be used to predict classes\ninws = '/image-directory-for-another-study-area'\ntiles = glob.glob(os.path.join(inws, '*.tif'))\n\n# h5 file from trained model\nin_h5 = \"/vgg16-model-50epochs.h5\"\n\n# Output model predictions in csv format\nout_csv = '/new-predictions.csv'\n\n# Read images and convert to numpy array\nx_test = np.array([cv2.imread(tile) for tile in tiles], np.float16) / 255.\n\nprint('Loading existing model...')\nloaded_model = load_model(in_h5)\n\nprint(\"Predicting on image tiles...\")\npredictions = loaded_model.predict(x_test, batch_size=128)\n\n# Save to csv\ndf = pd.DataFrame(predictions)\ndf['image'] = df.index + 1\ndf.to_csv(out_csv, index=False, header=False)\nprint(\"Predictions saved to disk: {0}\".format(out_csv))\n```"

        "content": "When working with deep learning models for image classification, especially when using a pre-trained model like VGG16, there are several factors that could lead to unexpected results when applying the model to new data from a different study area. Below are some potential issues and solutions to consider:\n\n1. **Data Preprocessing**:\n   - Ensure that the preprocessing of the new test images matches the preprocessing of the training images. This includes resizing, normalization, and any other transformations.\n   - Verify that the images are correctly resized to the expected input shape `(img_rows, img_cols, img_channel)` before passing them to the model.\n\n2. **Normalization**:\n   - If the training images were normalized (e.g., divided by 255.0), the test images must also be normalized in the same way. It seems you are doing this, but double-check that all images are being normalized consistently.\n\n3. **Channel Order**:\n   - Ensure the color channels are in the correct order (RGB or BGR) for both training and test datasets. Libraries like OpenCV often load images in BGR format, while Keras expects RGB. Adjust accordingly if needed using `cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)`.\n\n4. **Model Architecture and Weights**:\n   - Confirm that the model architecture and weights are loaded correctly. There might be a mismatch between the saved model and how it's being used for predictions. If there are any custom layers or modifications to the VGG16 architecture, ensure they are included during the model loading.\n\n5. **Probability Thresholding**:\n   - If you're using a sigmoid activation for multi-label classification, ensure that you apply a proper threshold to convert probabilities to class labels. The default threshold is typically 0.5, but this can vary depending on the distribution of your data.\n\n6. **Class Imbalance**:\n   - If your classes are imbalanced, it could lead to biased predictions. Consider using class weights or oversampling techniques during training to address this issue.\n\n7. **Model Compatibility**:\n   - Check the TensorFlow and Keras versions used during training and prediction. Incompatibilities between versions might cause unexpected behavior.\n\n8. **Additional Debugging**:\n   - Print out some of the predictions and corresponding input images to visually inspect if the model predictions make sense.\n   - Compare the distributions of predictions on the validation set and the test set to identify discrepancies.\n\n9. **Logs and Model Checkpoints**:\n   - If you have logs or model checkpoints, it might be useful to load the best-performing checkpoint instead of the final model.\n\nHere's a summary of how to address these points in your prediction script:\n\n```python\nimport glob\nimport os\nimport cv2\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom keras.models import load_model\n\n# Path to the input tiles which will be used to predict classes\ninws = '/image-directory-for-another-study-area'\ntiles = glob.glob(os.path.join(inws, '*.tif'))\n\n# h5 file from trained model\nin_h5 = \"/vgg16-model-50epochs.h5\"\n\n# Output model predictions in csv format\nout_csv = '/new-predictions.csv'\n\n# Read images and convert to numpy array\ndef preprocess_image(tile):\n    # Load image\n    image = cv2.imread(tile)\n    # Convert to RGB if needed\n    image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)\n    # Resize image to expected input shape\n    image = cv2.resize(image, (img_cols, img_rows))\n    # Normalize image\n    image = image.astype(np.float16) / 255.0\n    return image\n\nx_test = np.array([preprocess_image(tile) for tile in tiles])\n\nprint('Loading existing model...')\nloaded_model = load_model(in_h5)\n\nprint(\"Predicting on image tiles...\")\npredictions = loaded_model.predict(x_test, batch_size=128)\n\n# Save to csv\ndf = pd.DataFrame(predictions)\ndf['image'] = df.index + 1\ndf.to_csv(out_csv, index=False, header=False)\nprint(\"Predictions saved to disk: {0}\".format(out_csv))\n```\n\nBy ensuring that your preprocessing aligns with the training data, you should be able to achieve more sensible predictions on your new test dataset."
