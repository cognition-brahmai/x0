I've attempted to load the data in a way that I find more convenient, but I'm encountering an AttributeError saying the module object has no attribute 'datasets'. I'm confused as to why this error is occurring. Here's the code I've used:\n\n```\nIn [1]: import sklearn\n\nIn [2]: iris = sklearn.datasets.load_iris()\n```\n\nThis throws the following error:\n\n```\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)\n<ipython-input-2-db77d2036db5> in <module>()\n----> 1 iris = sklearn.datasets.load_iris()\n\nAttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'datasets'\n```\n\nHowever, when I use the seemingly similar method:\n\n```\nIn [3]: from sklearn import datasets\n\nIn [4]: iris = datasets.load_iris()\n```\n\nIt works without any problem. Even the following method works:\n\n```\nIn [5]: iris = sklearn.datasets.load_iris()\n```\n\nWhat am I missing here? What's the difference between the two approaches?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is related to how Python handles imports and module namespaces. Let's break down the two approaches:\n\n1. **Direct Import of Submodules:**\n   - When you use `import sklearn`, you're importing the top-level `sklearn` module. However, this doesn't automatically import all submodules (like `datasets`) within `sklearn`.\n   - If you try to access `sklearn.datasets` immediately after `import sklearn`, it will throw an `AttributeError` because the `datasets` submodule hasn't been loaded into memory yet.\n\n2. **Explicit Import of Submodules:**\n   - When you use `from sklearn import datasets`, you're explicitly importing the `datasets` submodule into your current namespace. This makes `datasets` available directly, and you can access `datasets.load_iris()` without any issue.\n   - Alternatively, after importing `datasets` explicitly, you can also access it via `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()` since it is now loaded into the `sklearn` namespace.\n\n3. **Imported Submodules and Caching:**\n   - Once you've imported a submodule (like `datasets`) using the `from sklearn import datasets` approach, Python caches it. Thus, subsequent attempts to access `sklearn.datasets` will succeed since the submodule is already loaded.\n\nTo summarize, if you want to use `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()`, make sure you either:\n- Directly import the submodule using `from sklearn import datasets`, or\n- Use `import sklearn.datasets` to load the submodule into the namespace.\n\nBy doing this, you ensure that the `datasets` submodule is loaded and available for use."
