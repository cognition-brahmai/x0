Information Gain measures the reduction in entropy or uncertainty about a target variable after observing a feature or attribute. It is calculated as the difference between the entropy of the target variable before and after splitting based on a particular feature.\n\nSince entropy is a measure of uncertainty and cannot be negative, the reduction in entropy (Information Gain) is also non-negative. In other words, observing additional information (splitting on a feature) can either reduce the uncertainty or leave it unchanged, but it cannot increase it, which would be required for Information Gain to be negative."
