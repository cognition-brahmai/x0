        "content": "In Python, I am looking into the usage of the NotImplemented constant. I've noticed through the decimal.py module that NotImplemented is used in many special methods. For instance:\n\n```python\nclass A(object):\n    def __lt__(self, a):\n        return NotImplemented\n\n    def __add__(self, a):\n        return NotImplemented\n```\nThe Python documentation states that NotImplemented is a special value which can be returned by the \u201crich comparison\u201d special methods (__eq__(), __lt__(), and friends), to indicate that the comparison is not implemented with respect to the other type. However, it doesn't discuss about other special methods or describe the behavior. \n\nI've also observed a peculiar behavior where if NotImplemented is returned from other special methods, it raises TypeError, and in \u201crich comparison\u201d special methods it does nothing. For example:\n\n```python\nprint A() < A() # prints True\nprint A() + 1 # raises TypeError\n```\nCan you explain what's going on and what is the usage/behavior of NotImplemented?"

        "content": "Certainly! The `NotImplemented` constant in Python is used as a way for special methods, particularly those involved in operator overloading, to signal that an operation is not implemented for the given operands. Understanding its behavior requires looking at how Python handles these special methods.\n\n### Usage in Rich Comparison Methods\n\nIn the context of rich comparison methods (`__eq__`, `__lt__`, `__gt__`, etc.), returning `NotImplemented` is a way to indicate that the method doesn't know how to handle the operation for the given operand types. When a comparison method returns `NotImplemented`, Python will try the reflected operation on the other operand. For example, if `a < b` returns `NotImplemented`, Python will attempt `b > a`. If both return `NotImplemented`, then Python raises a `TypeError`.\n\n### Behavior in Arithmetic and Other Special Methods\n\nFor other special methods, such as arithmetic methods (`__add__`, `__sub__`, etc.), returning `NotImplemented` has a slightly different implication. When these methods return `NotImplemented`, it indicates that the operation is not supported between the given operand types. Python will then attempt the reflected method (like `__radd__` for addition), if it exists on the other operand. If that too returns `NotImplemented` or doesn't exist, Python raises a `TypeError`.\n\n### Example and Explanation\n\nLet's look at the example you provided:\n\n```python\nclass A(object):\n    def __lt__(self, a):\n        return NotImplemented\n\n    def __add__(self, a):\n        return NotImplemented\n\nprint(A() < A())  # This works because it falls back on the other operand's reflected method.\nprint(A() + 1)    # This raises TypeError because there is no `__radd__` defined on the int or A.\n```\n\n- **`A() < A()`**: The `__lt__` method returns `NotImplemented`, so Python tries `A().__gt__(A())`, which doesn't exist, but due to the way Python's comparison defaults to object identity, this results in a fallback to the default comparison, which may evaluate as `False` or `True` depending on the implementation specifics.\n\n- **`A() + 1`**: The `__add__` method returns `NotImplemented`, so Python tries `1.__radd__(A())`. Since `int` doesn't know how to add an instance of `A`, this results in a `TypeError`.\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Rich Comparisons**: Returning `NotImplemented` allows Python to try the reverse comparison on the other operand.\n- **Other Methods**: Returning `NotImplemented` indicates the operation isn't supported, and Python will try the reverse method or raise a `TypeError`.\n\nThe use of `NotImplemented` is a way to delegate the handling of operations to other methods or indicate unsupported operations, and its behavior differs slightly depending on whether comparisons or other operations are involved."
