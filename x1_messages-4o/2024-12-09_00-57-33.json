Despite being able to compile the example successfully, I'm unable to run it because the system can't find libcudart.so.4. The error message I receive is \"./bandwidthTest: error while loading shared libraries: libcudart.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\". Is there a way I can manually specify the path to the CUDA runtime library to resolve this issue?"

        "content": "Certainly! The issue you're encountering is related to the dynamic linker not being able to find the CUDA runtime library `libcudart.so.4`. You can resolve this by specifying the path to the CUDA libraries. Here are a few steps you can follow to address this issue:\n\n1. **Locate the CUDA Library Path:**\n   First, determine where your CUDA libraries are installed. If you used the default installation path, they are typically located in `/usr/local/cuda/lib64` or `/usr/local/cuda/lib`.\n\n2. **Set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:**\n   You need to add the directory containing `libcudart.so.4` to your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. You can do this temporarily for the current session or permanently.\n\n   - **Temporarily (for the current session):**\n     Open a terminal and execute the following command:\n     ```bash\n     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n     ```\n     Replace `/usr/local/cuda/lib64` with the actual path if it's different.\n\n   - **Permanently (for all future sessions):**\n     Add the above line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` file:\n     ```bash\n     echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' >> ~/.bashrc\n     ```\n     Then, source the file to apply the changes:\n     ```bash\n     source ~/.bashrc\n     ```\n\n3. **Verify the Library Path:**\n   After setting the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, verify that the system can find the library using the `ldconfig` command:\n   ```bash\n   sudo ldconfig\n   ```\n\n4. **Run Your Program Again:**\n   Try running your compiled CUDA sample again. It should now be able to locate `libcudart.so.4`.\n\nBy setting the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, you're instructing the dynamic linker to look in the specified directory for shared libraries, which should resolve the issue you're experiencing."
