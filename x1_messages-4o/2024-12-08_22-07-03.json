        "content": "Creating a web page that displays the current composition of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), including voting members and hidden messages, while also providing information on its duties, responsibilities, recent decisions, and resolutions, can be an interesting project. Below, I'll provide you with guidance on how to achieve this using C# and ASP.NET, a popular framework for building web applications.\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide\n\n#### 1. Set Up Your ASP.NET Project\n\n1. **Create a New Project:**\n   - Open Visual Studio and create a new ASP.NET Core Web Application project.\n\n2. **Select a Template:**\n   - Choose a template, such as \"Web Application (Model-View-Controller)\" for an MVC architecture.\n\n#### 2. Create Models\n\nCreate a model for the UNSC members and their details.\n\n```csharp\npublic class UnscMember\n{\n    public string CountryName { get; set; }\n    public bool IsVotingMember { get; set; }\n    public string HiddenMessage { get; set; }  // For secret messages\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Create a Controller\n\nCreate a controller to handle the logic of fetching and displaying UNSC data.\n\n```csharp\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;\n\npublic class UnscController : Controller\n{\n    public IActionResult Index()\n    {\n        var members = new List<UnscMember>\n        {\n            new UnscMember { CountryName = \"United States\", IsVotingMember = true, HiddenMessage = \"A1B2C3\" },\n            new UnscMember { CountryName = \"United Kingdom\", IsVotingMember = true, HiddenMessage = \"D4E5F6\" },\n            // Add other members...\n        };\n\n        ViewBag.TotalCountries = members.Count;\n        ViewBag.TotalVotingMembers = members.Count(m => m.IsVotingMember);\n\n        return View(members);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. Create a View\n\nCreate a Razor view to display the data.\n\n```html\n@model List<UnscMember>\n\n<h2>UN Security Council Members</h2>\n\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Country</th>\n            <th>Voting Member</th>\n            <th>Decoded Message</th>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        @foreach (var member in Model)\n        {\n            <tr>\n                <td>@member.CountryName</td>\n                <td>@(member.IsVotingMember ? \"Yes\" : \"No\")</td>\n                <td>@DecodeMessage(member.HiddenMessage)</td> <!-- Assuming DecodeMessage is a method to decode -->\n            </tr>\n        }\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>Total Countries: @ViewBag.TotalCountries</p>\n<p>Total Voting Members: @ViewBag.TotalVotingMembers</p>\n\n@functions {\n    private string DecodeMessage(string encodedMessage)\n    {\n        // Implement your decoding logic here\n        return new string(encodedMessage.Reverse().ToArray()); // Example: Reverse the message\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### 5. Add Information on Duties, Responsibilities, and Recent Decisions\n\nTo add information about duties, responsibilities, and recent decisions, you can create a page or section within the same view.\n\n```html\n<h3>Duties and Responsibilities of the UNSC</h3>\n<p>The Security Council has primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security...</p>\n\n<h3>Recent Decisions and Resolutions</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>Resolution 2585 (2021) - Adopted by the Security Council at its 8746th meeting...</li>\n    <!-- Add more resolutions -->\n</ul>\n```\n\n#### 6. Running the Application\n\n1. **Build and Run:** Press `F5` or click on the \"Run\" button to start the application.\n2. **View in Browser:** The application should open in your default web browser, displaying the UNSC composition, duties, and recent resolutions.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Data Source:** For real-time data, consider integrating with an API or a database that provides up-to-date UNSC information.\n- **Security:** Ensure that any sensitive operations, such as decoding messages, are handled securely.\n- **Styling:** Use CSS to style your web page for better user experience.\n\nThis guide provides a basic framework, and you can expand upon it by adding more features or integrating additional data sources."
