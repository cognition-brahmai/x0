For instance, if I have the string \"the dude is a cool dude\", I would want to find the first index or position of the string 'dude'. I tried using the command `mystring.findfirstindex('dude')` but it doesn't seem to work. What is the correct Python command to accomplish this?"

This method returns the lowest index of the substring if it is found within the string; otherwise, it returns `-1`. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nmystring = \"the dude is a cool dude\"\nsubstring = \"dude\"\n\n# Find the first occurrence of 'dude'\nindex = mystring.find(substring)\n\nprint(index)\n```\n\nIn this example, `mystring.find(substring)` will return `4`, which is the index of the first occurrence of the substring 'dude' in `mystring`. If the substring is not found, `find()` will return `-1`."
