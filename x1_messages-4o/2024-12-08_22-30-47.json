Here's how you can do it:\n\n- **Bold:** To make the word \"pizza\" bold, you would wrap it in double asterisks (`**`) or double underscores (`__`). For example: \n\n  ```markdown\n  I love eating **pizza**.\n  ```\n\n  or\n\n  ```markdown\n  I love eating __pizza__.\n  ```\n\n- *Italic:* To make the word \"pizza\" italic, you would wrap it in single asterisks (`*`) or single underscores (`_`). For example:\n\n  ```markdown\n  I love eating *pizza*.\n  ```\n\n  or\n\n  ```markdown\n  I love eating _pizza_.\n  ```\n\nBoth methods are commonly used, so you can choose the one that best fits your style or requirements."
