        "content": "In physics, the motion of an object when acted upon by a force is governed by Newton's Second Law of Motion. This law states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma).\n\nTo calculate the motion of an object in Java when you know its initial position, velocity, and the force acting upon it, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute the acceleration using Newton's Second Law: \\( a = \\frac{F}{m} \\).\n2. Update the velocity using the acceleration: \\( v = u + at \\).\n3. Update the position using the velocity: \\( s = s_0 + ut + \\frac{1}{2}at^2 \\).\n\nHere's a simple Java code snippet demonstrating these calculations:\n\n```java\npublic class MotionCalculator {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        double initialPosition = 0.0; // Initial position (meters)\n        double initialVelocity = 0.0; // Initial velocity (m/s)\n        double force = 10.0;          // Force applied (Newtons)\n        double mass = 2.0;            // Mass of the object (kg)\n        double time = 5.0;            // Time over which the force is applied (seconds)\n\n        // Calculate acceleration using F = ma\n        double acceleration = force / mass;\n\n        // Calculate final velocity using v = u + at\n        double finalVelocity = initialVelocity + acceleration * time;\n\n        // Calculate final position using s = s0 + ut + 1/2at^2\n        double finalPosition = initialPosition + initialVelocity * time + 0.5 * acceleration * Math.pow(time, 2);\n\n        // Output the results\n        System.out.println(\"Final Velocity: \" + finalVelocity + \" m/s\");\n        System.out.println(\"Final Position: \" + finalPosition + \" meters\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we start with an initial position and velocity of zero, apply a constant force over a specified duration, and compute the resulting final velocity and position of the object. You can modify the initial conditions, force, mass, and time to simulate different scenarios."
