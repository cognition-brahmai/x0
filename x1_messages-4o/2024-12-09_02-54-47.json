Here's the code snippet:\n\n```python\nnarg=len(sys.argv)\nprint \"@length arg= \", narg\nif narg == 1:\n        print \"@Usage: input_filename nelements nintervals\"\n        break\n```\nHowever, I'm getting a SyntaxError that says, 'break' outside loop. Why is this happening?"

        "content": "The `break` statement in Python is specifically used to exit from loops prematurely, such as `for` or `while` loops. It cannot be used outside of these types of loops, which is why you're encountering a `SyntaxError`.\n\nIn the context of your code snippet, it seems like you're trying to halt the execution when a certain condition is met (i.e., when `narg == 1`). Since `break` isn't appropriate here, you might want to consider using `sys.exit()` instead, which will terminate the program. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nnarg = len(sys.argv)\nprint(\"@length arg= \", narg)\nif narg == 1:\n    print(\"@Usage: input_filename nelements nintervals\")\n    sys.exit()\n```\n\nThis will print your usage message and then exit the program if only one argument is provided. Make sure to import the `sys` module at the beginning of your script if you haven't already."
