Here's an example of the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nl = [('a',1),('b',2)]\nh = {}\n[h.update({k:v}) for k,v in l]\nprint(h)\n```\nThis gives me the output: \n\n```python\n{'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n```\nHowever, this approach seems a bit cumbersome. Is there a more efficient or cleaner way, maybe a one-liner, to achieve this?"

Here's a one-liner that accomplishes the same task:\n\n```python\nl = [('a', 1), ('b', 2)]\nh = {k: v for k, v in l}\nprint(h)\n```\n\nThis will give you the same output:\n\n```python\n{'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n```\n\nDictionary comprehensions are not only more concise but also generally considered more Pythonic and efficient compared to using a list comprehension with `.update()`."
