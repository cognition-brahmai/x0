I have a dataframe created as follows:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'A': ['one', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'three', 'one'], 'B': range(6)})\nprint(df)\n```\n\nwhich gives me:\n\n```\n       A  B\n0    one  0\n1    one  1\n2    two  2\n3  three  3\n4  three  4\n5    one  5\n```\n\nWhen I try to group this dataframe by column 'A' using `print(df.groupby('A'))`, it doesn't print the grouped dataframe as I expected, but instead I get `<pandas.core.groupby.DataFrameGroupBy object at 0x05416E90>`. \n\nFurther, using `print(df.groupby('A').head())` gives me a result that looks like the dataframe was not grouped at all:\n\n```\n             A  B\nA                \none   0    one  0\n      1    one  1\ntwo   2    two  2\nthree 3  three  3\n      4  three  4\none   5    one  5\n```\n\nI am expecting an output like:\n\n```\n             A  B\nA                \none   0    one  0\n      1    one  1\n      5    one  5\ntwo   2    two  2\nthree 3  three  3\n      4  three  4\n```\n\nHow can I achieve this?"

        "content": "When you group a DataFrame using `pandas`, the result is a `DataFrameGroupBy` object, which is not directly printable like a DataFrame. To view the grouped data in a more readable format, you can use several methods that perform an aggregation or transformation on the grouped data.\n\nTo achieve the output you're expecting, you can use the `groupby` method followed by `apply(list)` or `apply(lambda x: x)`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create the dataframe\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'A': ['one', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'three', 'one'], 'B': range(6)})\n\n# Group by 'A' and apply a lambda function to keep the format\ngrouped = df.groupby('A').apply(lambda x: x)\n\nprint(grouped)\n```\n\nThis will give you the output:\n\n```\n             A  B\nA                \none   0    one  0\n      1    one  1\n      5    one  5\nthree 3  three  3\n      4  three  4\ntwo   2    two  2\n```\n\nThe `apply(lambda x: x)` function ensures that the data is maintained in a grouped data format, similar to what you've described. You can also use other aggregation functions if you need to perform specific calculations on each group, such as `sum`, `mean`, etc."
