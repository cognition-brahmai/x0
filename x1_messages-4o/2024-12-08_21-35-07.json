The program should prompt the user to guess the shape of the plate, and they will have three attempts to guess correctly. The shape of the plate will be randomly generated from a pool of shapes: circular, square, or triangular. \nBut that's not all! The Plate class should also have a method that returns a clue about the shape of the plate based on its area. The area of the plate will be calculated by the program and provided to the user. However, the clue will only be revealed if the user fails to guess the shape correctly in their first two attempts.\nNow, for the non-kitchen application of the Plate object. Imagine a scenario where you need to sort different types of objects based on their shape. The Plate object can be repurposed to help solve this problem. You can create a ShapeSorter class that has a method to add objects of various shapes to a list. The objects will be sorted based on their shape, and the ShapeSorter class will use the Plate class to determine the shape of each object. The implementation will require some tweaking, but it's an innovative way to use the Plate object outside the kitchen."

        "content": "Certainly! Here's a Python program that implements the `Plate` class with a mystery shape, and the `ShapeSorter` class to sort objects based on their shape. The program includes a guessing game where the user has three attempts to guess the shape of the plate.\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport math\n\nclass Plate:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.shapes = ['circular', 'square', 'triangular']\n        self.shape = random.choice(self.shapes)\n        self.area = self.calculate_area()\n\n    def calculate_area(self):\n        if self.shape == 'circular':\n            radius = random.uniform(1, 10)\n            return math.pi * radius ** 2\n        elif self.shape == 'square':\n            side = random.uniform(1, 10)\n            return side ** 2\n        elif self.shape == 'triangular':\n            base = random.uniform(1, 10)\n            height = random.uniform(1, 10)\n            return 0.5 * base * height\n\n    def get_clue(self):\n        if self.shape == 'circular':\n            return \"The area formula is \u03c0r\u00b2.\"\n        elif self.shape == 'square':\n            return \"The area formula is side\u00b2.\"\n        elif self.shape == 'triangular':\n            return \"The area formula is 0.5 * base * height.\"\n\n    def guess_shape(self):\n        attempts = 3\n        print(f\"Guess the shape of the plate.
