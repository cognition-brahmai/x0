After researching the error, I found a solution on Stack Overflow which recommended downloading the 'requests' security package using the command `pip install requests[security]`. However, when I run this command I receive the error `zsh: no matches found: requests[security]`. I am able to install and upgrade 'requests' without any issues. I am unable to understand why this command isn't working. I am running this on a Debian Server. Can anyone assist me in resolving this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, `zsh: no matches found: requests[security]`, is due to the fact that the square brackets are being interpreted by the zsh shell as a pattern to match files in the current directory. To resolve this issue, you can escape the square brackets or use quotes around the package name to prevent zsh from interpreting them. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using Quotes**: You can enclose the package name in single or double quotes to prevent zsh from interpreting the square brackets.\n\n   ```sh\n   pip install 'requests[security]'\n   ```\n\n   or\n\n   ```sh\n   pip install \"requests[security]\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Escaping Brackets**: Alternatively, you can escape the square brackets with a backslash.\n\n   ```sh\n   pip install requests\\[security\\]\n   ```\n\nBoth of these methods should allow you to install the `requests[security]` package without any issues. Once installed, this should help you address the `InsecurePlatformWarning` you're encountering with `urllib2`. If the issue persists, ensure that your `pip` and Python environment are correctly set up and that you have the necessary permissions to install packages on your system."
