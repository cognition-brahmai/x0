I have tried the code provided below, and it works well, but I'm wondering if there is a simpler or more Pythonic way to achieve the same thing. Here is my attempt:\n\n```python\nclass MyClass(object):\n\n    _MY_DATA = None\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def _retrieve_my_data():\n        my_data = ...  # costly database call\n        return my_data\n\n    @classmethod\n    def get_my_data(cls):\n        if cls._MY_DATA is None:\n            cls._MY_DATA = MyClass._retrieve_my_data()\n        return cls._MY_DATA\n```"

        "content": "Your approach is quite effective and clear for lazy initialization of a class member. However, if you're looking for a more Pythonic or streamlined way, you might consider using the `property` decorator in combination with a class method to manage lazy loading. But since you're dealing with a class-level attribute, your current method is actually a good fit. The `@classmethod` approach is appropriate because it allows you to handle class-level state.\n\nIf you're open to using instance-level lazy loading with properties, here's how you might handle it:\n\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._my_data = None\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def _retrieve_my_data():\n        my_data = ...  # costly database call\n        return my_data\n\n    @property\n    def my_data(self):\n        if self._my_data is None:\n            self._my_data = self._retrieve_my_data()\n        return self._my_data\n```\n\nThis version uses an instance-level attribute and the `@property` decorator to achieve lazy loading. This is more suitable if you expect each instance of the class to potentially have different data or if you do not require shared state across instances.\n\nHowever, since it seems like you need a class-level lazy initialization (shared across instances), your original approach is actually quite suitable and idiomatic for such a use case. If you are using Python 3.8 or newer, you might also consider using the `@staticmethod` decorator in conjunction with `@lru_cache` from the `functools` module for memoization, but it would be more useful for functions rather than class attributes.\n\nHere's a minor refinement using the `classmethod` approach:\n\n```python\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\nclass MyClass:\n    _MY_DATA = None\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def _retrieve_my_data():\n        my_data = ...  # costly database call\n        return my_data\n\n    @classmethod\n    def get_my_data(cls):\n        if cls._MY_DATA is None:\n            cls._MY_DATA = cls._retrieve_my_data()\n        return cls._MY_DATA\n```\n\nBoth your original code and this refined version are efficient for class-level lazy initialization, and they adhere to the Pythonic principle of readability and simplicity."
