However, you can effectively achieve this by using the `return` command. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Use the `return` command**: Once inside the function, you can use the `return` command. This command continues execution until the current function returns, effectively stepping out of the function. It stops at the point where the function is about to return.\n\n   ```python\n   (Pdb) return\n   ```\n\n2. **Alternative: Use the `until` command**: If you know the line number where the function returns or the next line you want to stop at outside the function, you can use the `until` command with a line number as an argument. This will continue execution until it reaches the specified line number.\n\n   ```python\n   (Pdb) until <line_number>\n   ```\n\nThese methods are useful for quickly exiting a function you've stepped into without having to manually step through each line within the function."
