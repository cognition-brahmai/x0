The structure of the flat dictionary should not pose any problems with ambiguities and I want my solution to work for dictionaries of arbitrary depth. The values in my dictionary are either scalars or strings, never iterables.\n\nFor example, I have a dictionary like:\n\n```python\nflat = {'X_a_one': 10,\n        'X_a_two': 20, \n        'X_b_one': 10,\n        'X_b_two': 20, \n        'Y_a_one': 10,\n        'Y_a_two': 20,\n        'Y_b_one': 10,\n        'Y_b_two': 20}\n```\n\nI want to convert it to:\n\n```python\nnested = {'X': {'a': {'one': 10,\n                      'two': 20}, \n                'b': {'one': 10,\n                      'two': 20}}, \n          'Y': {'a': {'one': 10,\n                      'two': 20},\n                'b': {'one': 10,\n                      'two': 20}}}\n```\n\nSo far, I have a function that can take a dictionary and nest it one level deep, but I'm having trouble making it recursive to handle all levels of the dictionary. Here is my current function:\n\n```python\ndef nest_once(inp_dict):\n    out = {}\n    if isinstance(inp_dict, dict):\n        for key, val in inp_dict.items():\n            if '_' in key:\n                head, tail = key.split('_', 1)\n\n                if head not in out.keys():\n                    out[head] = {tail: val}\n                else:\n                    out[head].update({tail: val})\n            else:\n                out[key] = val\n    return out\n\ntest_out = nest_once(test_dict)\n```\n\nCan anyone help me modify this function to recursively create a nested dictionary from my flattened dictionary?"

        "content": "Certainly! To convert a flattened dictionary into a nested dictionary recursively, you can modify your `nest_once` function to handle multiple levels of nesting by splitting the keys at underscores and recursively building up the nested structure. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef nest_dict(flat_dict):\n    nested = {}\n    \n    for key, value in flat_dict.items():\n        keys = key.split('_')  # Split the key into parts\n        current_level = nested\n        \n        # Iterate over each part except the last one\n        for part in keys[:-1]:\n            # If part is not already a key in the current level, add it\n            if part not in current_level:\n                current_level[part] = {}\n            # Move down one level\n            current_level = current_level[part]\n        \n        # Assign the value to the last key part\n        current_level[keys[-1]] = value\n    \n    return nested\n\n# Example usage\nflat = {'X_a_one': 10, 'X_a_two': 20, 'X_b_one': 10, 'X_b_two': 20, \n        'Y_a_one': 10, 'Y_a_two': 20, 'Y_b_one': 10, 'Y_b_two': 20}\n\nnested = nest_dict(flat)\nprint(nested)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Splitting Keys**: For each key in the flattened dictionary, split the key string on underscores (`_`) to get the hierarchical parts.\n\n2. **Iterating Over Parts**: Iterate over each part of the key except the last one. For each part, check if it's already a key in the current level of the dictionary. If not, add it and assign an empty dictionary to it.\n\n3. **Building the Nest**: Update the `current_level` to point to the nested dictionary corresponding to the current part. This allows you to \"dive deeper\" into the nested structure.\n\n4. **Assigning Values**: Finally, assign the value to the last part of the key in the current level.\n\nThis function should handle arbitrary levels of nesting based on the structure of the keys in your flattened dictionary."
