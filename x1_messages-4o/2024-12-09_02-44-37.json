This method works on both Unix-like systems and Windows. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nhome_directory = os.path.expanduser(\"~\")\nprint(\"Home directory:\", home_directory)\n```\n\nThe `os.path.expanduser(\"~\")` function will return the path to the current user's home directory, regardless of the operating system. It interprets the tilde (`~`) as the home directory of the current user, making it a consistent and reliable method across different platforms."
