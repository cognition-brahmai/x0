        "content": "To initialize a Tkinter window as maximized and to get both the maximized dimensions and any subsequent resized dimensions, you can use the following approach:\n\n1. **Maximize the Window:**\n   You can use the `state` method to maximize the window. In Windows, you can set the window state to \"zoomed\" to maximize it.\n\n2. **Get Window Dimensions:**\n   You can use the `winfo_width` and `winfo_height` methods to get the current dimensions of the window. These methods will reflect changes if the window is resized by the user.\n\nHere's a sample code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\n\ndef print_dimensions(event=None):\n    # Get the current width and height of the window\n    width = root.winfo_width()\n    height = root.winfo_height()\n    print(f\"Current Window Size: {width}x{height}\")\n\n# Create the main window\nroot = tk.Tk()\n\n# Maximize the window\nroot.state('zoomed')\n\n# Bind an event to print the dimensions whenever the window size changes\nroot.bind('<Configure>', print_dimensions)\n\n# You can also print the maximized dimensions right after maximizing\nroot.update_idletasks()  # Make sure to update the window state\nprint_dimensions()\n\n# Start the Tkinter event loop\nroot.mainloop()\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- The `root.state('zoomed')` line ensures that the window opens in a maximized state on Windows.\n- The `print_dimensions` function uses `root.winfo_width()` and `root.winfo_height()` to fetch the current dimensions of the window.\n- The `root.bind('<Configure>', print_dimensions)` line binds the `Configure` event, which is triggered every time the window size changes, including when it's initially maximized or resized by the user.\n- `root.update_idletasks()` is used to force a re-calculation of the geometry to ensure that `winfo_width()` and `winfo_height()` return the correct values right after maximizing.\n\nThis setup will give you both the maximized dimensions when the window first opens and the dimensions whenever the user resizes the window."
