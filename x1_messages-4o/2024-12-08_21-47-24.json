        "content": "To evaluate a list of mathematical expressions in Python, you can use the `eval()` function, which will handle the arithmetic operations and respect the order of operations, including parentheses. However, you should be cautious when using `eval()` with untrusted input, as it can execute arbitrary code. For safer evaluation, consider using libraries like `asteval` or `sympy`. Here is a simple example using `eval()`:\n\n```python\ndef evaluate_expressions(expressions):\n    results = []\n    for expression in expressions:\n        try:\n            # Evaluate the mathematical expression\n            result = eval(expression)\n            # Ensure the result is an integer\n            if isinstance(result, (int, float)):\n                results.append(int(result))\n            else:\n                # If the result is not a number, raise an error\n                raise ValueError(\"Expression did not evaluate to a number.\")\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"Error evaluating expression '{expression}': {e}\")\n            results.append(None)  # Append None or any other placeholder for errors\n    return results\n\n# Example usage\nexpressions = [\"3 + 5\", \"10 - (2 * 3)\", \"(4 * 5) / 2\", \"8 / 0\", \"2 + 3 * 4\"]\nresults = evaluate_expressions(expressions)\nprint(results)  # Output: [8, 4, 10, None, 14]\n```\n\nThis code will:\n\n1. Loop through each expression in the list.\n2. Evaluate the expression using `eval()`.\n3. Convert the result to an integer (truncating decimals) and append it to the results list.\n4. Handle any errors by printing an error message and appending `None` to the results list.\n\nRemember to use this code with caution and ensure that the input expressions are from a trusted source. For more robust and secure solutions, consider using a library that evaluates mathematical expressions safely."
