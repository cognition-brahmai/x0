Is there a way to instruct Python to match this as soon as possible?"

        "content": "To create a regular expression in Python that matches \"b\" in the input \"a (b) c (d) e\" without capturing \"b) c (d\", you can use a non-greedy (or lazy) quantifier. By default, quantifiers like `*` and `+` are greedy, meaning they match as much as possible. To make them non-greedy, you can append a `?` to the quantifier.\n\nHere's how you can modify your regular expression to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Input string\ntext = \"a (b) c (d) e\"\n\n# Non-greedy regex pattern\npattern = r\"\\((.*?)\\)\"\n\n# Find all matches\nmatches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n\n# Print the matches\nprint(matches)\n```\n\nIn this pattern, `\\(.*?\\)` is used:\n\n- `\\(` and `\\)` match the literal parentheses.\n- `.*?` is the non-greedy version of `.*`, meaning it matches as few characters as possible until the next part of the pattern (in this case, `\\)`) is satisfied.\n\nThis pattern will find all substrings enclosed in parentheses and match them non-greedily, resulting in `['b', 'd']` as the output for the given input."
