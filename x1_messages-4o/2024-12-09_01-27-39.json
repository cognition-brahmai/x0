I am specifically looking for an optimized way to count combinations. The current method that I am using calls the factorial function which takes too long to compute for larger numbers. Is there a more efficient way to compute combinations?\n\nHere is my current code:\n\n```python\nfrom math import factorial\n\ndef product(iterable):\n    prod = 1\n    for n in iterable:\n        prod *= n\n    return prod\n\ndef npr(n, r):\n    assert 0 <= r <= n\n    return product(range(n - r + 1, n + 1))\n\ndef ncr(n, r):\n    assert 0 <= r <= n\n    if r > n // 2:\n        r = n - r\n    return npr(n, r) // factorial(r)\n```"

        "content": "Certainly! When dealing with combinations, especially for large numbers, using the factorial function can indeed be inefficient. Instead of relying on factorial computations, we can optimize the calculation of combinations by directly computing the product of a range of numbers. This approach avoids the need for full factorial computations and can significantly improve performance for larger numbers.\n\nHere's an optimized version of your `ncr` function that doesn't directly use factorials:\n\n```python\ndef ncr(n, r):\n    assert 0 <= r <= n\n    if r > n - r:  # Take advantage of symmetry\n        r = n - r\n    if r == 0:\n        return 1\n    numer = product(range(n, n - r, -1))  # Multiplying n * (n-1) * ... * (n-r+1)\n    denom = product(range(1, r + 1))     # Multiplying r * (r-1) * ... * 1\n    return numer // denom\n\ndef product(iterable):\n    prod = 1\n    for n in iterable:\n        prod *= n\n    return prod\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Symmetry in Combinations**: \\( C(n, r) = C(n, n-r) \\). This allows the calculation to be reduced in cases where \\( r \\) is greater than \\( n - r \\).\n\n2. **Direct Product Calculation**: Instead of calculating factorials, compute the product directly for both the numerator and the denominator. This avoids large intermediate values that occur with factorial computation.\n\n3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The condition `if r == 0` returns 1 because \\( C(n, 0) = 1 \\).\n\nBy using this method, you should find that the computation for large values of \\( n \\) and \\( r \\) is significantly faster and more efficient."
