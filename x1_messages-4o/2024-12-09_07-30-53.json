However, when I run the following code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport time\nimport theano\nA = np.random.rand(1000,10000).astype(theano.config.floatX)\nB = np.random.rand(10000,1000).astype(theano.config.floatX)\nnp_start = time.time()\nAB = A.dot(B)\nnp_end = time.time()\nX,Y = theano.tensor.matrices('XY')\nmf = theano.function([X,Y],X.dot(Y))\nt_start = time.time()\ntAB = mf(A,B)\nt_end = time.time()\nprint (\"NP time: %f[s], theano time: %f[s] **(times should be close when run on CPU!)**\" %(np_end-np_start, t_end-t_start))\nprint (\"Result difference: %f\" % (np.abs(AB-tAB).max(), ))\n```\n\nThe output I get is:\n\n```\nNP time: 0.161123[s], theano time: 0.167119[s] (times should be close when run on CPU!)\nResult difference: 0.000000\n```\n\nThis suggests that I am running on my CPU instead of my GPU. I am using a workstation with Nvidia Quadro k4200 and have already installed the CUDA toolkit. I have also successfully worked on a CUDA vectorAdd sample project on VS2012. How can I run this code on my GPU?"

        "content": "To ensure that Theano is utilizing your GPU, you'll need to make sure a few things are set up correctly. Here are the steps you should follow:\n\n1. **Install CUDA and cuDNN**: Ensure that you have installed the correct version of CUDA and cuDNN that is compatible with your GPU and Theano. Your Nvidia Quadro K4200 supports CUDA, so check the compatibility with your CUDA toolkit version.\n\n2. **Configure Theano for GPU Usage**: You need to set Theano's configuration to use the GPU. This can be done by modifying your `.theanorc` file or by setting environment variables. Here is an example of a `.theanorc` configuration:\n\n    ```ini\n    [global]\n    device = cuda\n    floatX = float32\n\n    [cuda]\n    root = /usr/local/cuda\n    ```\n\n    Replace `/usr/local/cuda` with the path to your CUDA installation if it's different.\n\n3. **Check GPU Availability**: You can check if Theano is recognizing the GPU by running a simple script:\n\n    ```python\n    import theano\n    print(theano.config.device)\n    ```\n\n    This should output `cuda` if it's set correctly.\n\n4. **Environment Variables**: Alternatively, you can set the device via environment variables before running your script:\n\n    ```bash\n    export THEANO_FLAGS=device=cuda,floatX=float32\n    ```\n\n5. **Verify GPU Usage**: To confirm that Theano is running operations on the GPU, you can use a tool like `nvidia-smi` to monitor GPU usage.\n\n6. **Check for Errors**: If Theano still doesn't run on the GPU, check for any errors or warnings during the execution that might indicate why the GPU isn't being used.\n\n7. **Update Theano and Dependencies**: Make sure you have the latest versions of Theano and its dependencies. You can update using pip:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install --upgrade theano\n    ```\n\n8. **Test with a Smaller Matrix**: Sometimes, performance improvements are not noticeable with smaller matrices on the GPU due to the overhead of transferring data between CPU and GPU. Try with a larger matrix if possible.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to run your Theano code on the GPU. If you continue to have issues, consider checking Theano's user forums or documentation for more troubleshooting tips."
