        "content": "In Python's `pdb` module, the `list` (or `l`) command is used to display lines of code around the current line. By default, if you use the `list` command multiple times, it continues from where it left off previously. If you'd like to reset the line count and start listing from the current line again, you can specify the current line number as an argument to the `list` command.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Determine the current line number. You can see this in the `pdb` prompt, or you can use the `where` (or `w`) command to show the current stack trace and find the current line number.\n\n2. Use the `list` command with the current line number as an argument to reset the listing:\n\n   ```\n   (Pdb) list <current_line_number>\n   ```\n\nFor example, if your current line number is 10, you would use:\n\n```\n(Pdb) list 10\n```\n\nThis will reset the listing to start from line 10 again, allowing you to see the code context from the current line onward.\n\nIf you want to completely reset and list the default range around the current line, you can simply use the `list` command without arguments immediately after listing with a specific line number:\n\n```\n(Pdb) list <current_line_number>\n(Pdb) list\n```\n\nThis sequence will help you reset and redisplay the context around the current line."
