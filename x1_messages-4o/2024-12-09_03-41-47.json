In the following code snippet, when an assertion error is raised in function 'c', I only get a partial stack trace that does not include the call to function 'a'. How can I modify this code to get a complete stack trace?\n\n```python\nimport traceback\n\ndef a():\n    b()\n\ndef b():\n    try:\n        c()\n    except:\n        traceback.print_exc()\n\ndef c():\n    assert False\n\na()\n```\n\nThis is the stack trace output that I currently get:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"test.py\", line 8, in b\n    c()\n  File \"test.py\", line 13, in c\n    assert False\nAssertionError\n```\n\nI would like to get a stack trace similar to what I get when I allow the exception to propagate to the top level, as shown in this code snippet:\n\n```python\ndef a():\n    b()\n\ndef b():\n    c()\n\ndef c():\n    assert False\n\na()\n```\n\nThis is the complete stack trace output that I want:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"test.py\", line 10, in <module>\n    a()\n  File \"test.py\", line 2, in a\n    b()\n  File \"test.py\", line 5, in b\n    c()\n  File \"test.py\", line 8, in c\n    assert False\nAssertionError\n```"

        "content": "To achieve a complete stack trace, including the call to function `a`, you need to ensure that the exception is allowed to propagate up the call stack rather than being caught and handled within function `b`. In Python, the `traceback` module can be used to capture and print the full stack trace at any point, but for the complete trace, it\u2019s often better to let the exception bubble up naturally.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired stack trace:\n\n```python\nimport traceback\n\ndef a():\n    b()\n\ndef b():\n    c()\n\ndef c():\n    assert False\n\ntry:\n    a()\nexcept Exception as e:\n    traceback.print_exc()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Remove the `try-except` block in function `b`:** By removing the exception handling within function `b`, the exception is allowed to propagate back to the top-level where it can be caught.\n- **Catch the exception at the top-level:** By using a `try-except` block around the call to `a()` at the top-level, you can capture and print the complete stack trace using `traceback.print_exc()`.\n\nThis way, when the assertion fails in function `c`, the stack trace will include the calls from `a` to `b` to `c`, providing the complete trace you want."
