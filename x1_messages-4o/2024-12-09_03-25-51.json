I'll guide you through creating the decorator, using it in your views, and ensuring it works across multiple applications within your project.\n\n### Step 1: Create the Decorator\n\n1. **Define the Decorator:**\n\n   You'll start by defining a decorator function in a file, typically within a utility module or a specific `decorators.py` file in one of your apps. Here's an example of how such a decorator might look:\n\n   ```python\n   from django.http import HttpResponseForbidden\n   from functools import wraps\n\n   def premium_required(view_func):\n       @wraps(view_func)\n       def _wrapped_view(request, *args, **kwargs):\n           if not request.user.is_authenticated:\n               return HttpResponseForbidden(\"You must be logged in to access this page.\")\n           \n           if not hasattr(request.user, 'is_premium') or not request.user.is_premium:\n               return HttpResponseForbidden(\"You must be a premium user to access this page.\")\n           \n           return view_func(request, *args, **kwargs)\n       \n       return _wrapped_view\n   ```\n\n   In this example, the decorator checks if the user is authenticated and whether they have a `is_premium` attribute set to `True`. You might need to adjust this according to how your user model is structured.\n\n2. **Add the Decorator to Your App:**\n\n   Save the above function in a file named `decorators.py` in one of your Django apps, for example, `myapp/decorators.py`.\n\n### Step 2: Use the Decorator in Views\n\n1. **Import and Use the Decorator:**\n\n   In your views, you can now import and use this decorator. Here's an example of how to apply it to a view:\n\n   ```python\n   from django.shortcuts import render\n   from myapp.decorators import premium_required\n\n   @premium_required\n   def premium_view(request):\n       return render(request, 'premium_content.html')\n   ```\n\n   Apply the `@premium_required` decorator to any view that should be restricted to premium users.\n\n### Step 3: Utilize the Decorator Across Multiple Applications\n\n1. **Organize Common Utilities:**\n\n   If you want to use this decorator across multiple apps in your Django project, it's a good idea to place it in a shared module, such as a `core` or `utils` app that can be imported anywhere.\n\n2. **Refactor and Share:**\n\n   Create a new app or a module if you don't already have one, for example, `core`. Move your `decorators.py` file to this app:\n\n   ```\n   myproject/\n       core/\n           __init__.py\n           decorators.py\n       app1/\n       app2/\n   ```\n\n3. **Update Imports:**\n\n   Now, update your import statements in views across different apps to import the decorator from the `core` module:\n\n   ```python\n   from core.decorators import premium_required\n   ```\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Testing:** Ensure you properly test the decorator to make sure it functions as expected across different views and user scenarios.\n- **Permissions:** Consider integrating with Django's permission system or a third-party package like Django Guardian if you need more complex permission handling.\n- **Attribute Handling:** Ensure that your User model includes a way to check if a user is premium. If you're using Django's default User model, you may need to extend it with a profile model or a custom user model.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively create and manage a custom decorator for premium user access across multiple applications within your Django project."
