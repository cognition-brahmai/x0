        "content": "I have been using Python's namedtuple as a lightweight, immutable data class for bookkeeping parameters rather than dictionaries. I have seen classes that inherit from namedtuple and I am curious about the functionality they gain and the performance they lose. I have implemented a class that inherits from namedtuple like so:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import namedtuple\n\nclass Pokemon(namedtuple('Pokemon', 'name type level')):\n    \"\"\"\n    Attributes\n    ----------\n    name : str\n        What do you call your Pokemon?\n    type : str\n        grass, rock, electric, etc.\n    level : int\n        Experience level [0, 100]\n    \"\"\"\n     __slots__ = ()\n```\n\nI use this implementation for the sole purpose of being able to document the attributes cleanly and use `__slots__` to prevent the creation of a `__dict__`, thus preserving the lightweight nature of namedtuples. Is there a better recommendation of a lightweight data class for documenting parameters? I am currently using Python 2.7."

        "content": "Your approach of using `namedtuple` and documenting it with a class docstring is quite effective for Python 2.7, especially since you're taking advantage of `__slots__` to prevent the creation of a `__dict__` and keep the instances lightweight. However, there are a few considerations and alternatives you might explore:\n\n### Considerations:\n1. **Immutability**: Since `namedtuple` instances are immutable, they are a good fit for configurations or parameters that shouldn't change after creation.\n2. **Performance**: Inheriting from `namedtuple` and using `__slots__` helps to maintain performance by avoiding the overhead of a `__dict__`.\n3. **Documentation**: Your use of a class-level docstring is a practical way to document attributes.\n\n### Alternatives for Python 2.7:\n\n1. **Record Class**:\n   - You could create a simple class with an `__init__` method, but this would lose the immutability and the lightweight nature unless you manually enforce these properties.\n\n    ```python\n    class Pokemon:\n        __slots__ = ('name', 'type', 'level')\n\n        def __init__(self, name, type, level):\n            self.name = name\n            self.type = type\n            self.level = level\n    ```\n\n2. **attrs Library**:\n   - If you are open to using third-party libraries, `attrs` is a powerful library that provides a way to define classes with less boilerplate and more functionality, such as optional immutability and validation.\n   - You can install it via `pip install attrs`.\n\n    ```python\n    import attr\n\n    @attr.s(frozen=True, slots=True)\n    class Pokemon:\n        name = attr.ib(type=str)\n        type = attr.ib(type=str)\n        level = attr.ib(type=int)\n    ```\n\n3. **Future Consideration**:\n   - If you plan to upgrade to Python 3 at any point, the `dataclasses` module introduced in Python 3.7 provides similar functionality and is part of the standard library. It allows you to create classes that are mutable by default but can be made immutable.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven that you are using Python 2.7, your current approach is quite suitable. If you need more features like type validation or need to introduce optional mutability, consider using the `attrs` library. It offers more flexibility and is well-suited for creating lightweight data classes."
