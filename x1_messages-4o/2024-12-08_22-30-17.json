Can the script also include a function that suggests alternative ingredients for the rare or exotic ingredient in case it is not available?"

        "content": "Creating a Python script to generate a recipe for a traditional Italian dish with detailed instructions is an interesting project. To achieve this, you can use a structured approach by breaking down the task into smaller functions. Below is a sample script that includes detailed instructions, a list of necessary ingredients, and tips for authenticity. It also suggests alternatives for a rare or exotic ingredient.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# Function to generate a recipe for a traditional Italian dish\ndef generate_italian_recipe():\n    # Define a recipe template\n    recipe_template = {\n        \"name\": \"Osso Buco\",\n        \"ingredients\": [\n            {\"name\": \"Veal shanks\", \"quantity\": \"4 pieces\"},\n            {\"name\": \"Flour\", \"quantity\": \"1/2 cup\"},\n            {\"name\": \"Olive oil\", \"quantity\": \"2 tablespoons\"},\n            {\"name\": \"Onion\", \"quantity\": \"1, chopped\"},\n            {\"name\": \"Carrot\", \"quantity\": \"1, chopped\"},\n            {\"name\": \"Celery\", \"quantity\": \"1 stalk, chopped\"},\n            {\"name\": \"Garlic\", \"quantity\": \"2 cloves, minced\"},\n            {\"name\": \"White wine\", \"quantity\": \"1 cup\"},\n            {\"name\": \"Beef broth\", \"quantity\": \"2 cups\"},\n            {\"name\": \"Tomato paste\", \"quantity\": \"2 tablespoons\"},\n            {\"name\": \"Bay leaf\", \"quantity\": \"1\"},\n            {\"name\": \"Fresh thyme\", \"quantity\": \"1 teaspoon\"},\n            {\"name\": \"Salt\", \"quantity\": \"to taste\"},\n            {\"name\": \"Pepper\", \"quantity\": \"to taste\"},\n            {\"name\": \"Gremolata (lemon zest, garlic, parsley mixture)\", \"quantity\": \"for garnish\"},\n            {\"name\": \"Saffron threads\", \"quantity\": \"a pinch\"}  # Rare ingredient\n        ],\n        \"instructions\": [\n            \"Dredge the veal shanks in flour, shaking off the excess.\",\n            \"Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat.\",\n            \"Brown the veal shanks on all sides, then remove and set aside.\",\n            \"In the same pot, add onion, carrot, and celery.

This makes it easy to modify or expand the script for other recipes.\n- **Rare Ingredient:** Saffron threads are included as the rare ingredient. The script provides a function to suggest alternatives if saffron is unavailable.\n- **Functions:** The script is modularized using functions for generating the recipe and suggesting alternatives, improving readability and maintainability.\n- **Tips for Authenticity:** The script includes tips to achieve an authentic flavor.\n  \nThis script is a basic template and can be further enhanced with additional features like user input to select different recipes or ingredients."
