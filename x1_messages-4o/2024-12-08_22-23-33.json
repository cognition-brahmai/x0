Find the intersection of the two lists to get words that appear in both lists.\n3. Filter the words that have at least two distinct vowels in unique positions.\n4. Sort the resulting list in ascending order.\n\nHere's a Python program that does this:\n\n```python\ndef has_two_distinct_vowels(word):\n    vowels = set('aeiou')\n    distinct_vowel_positions = set()\n\n    for index, char in enumerate(word):\n        if char in vowels:\n            distinct_vowel_positions.add(index)\n        if len(distinct_vowel_positions) >= 2:\n            return True\n\n    return False\n\ndef get_common_words_with_vowels(list1, list2):\n    # Find common words\n    common_words = set(list1).intersection(set(list2))\n    \n    # Filter words with at least two distinct vowels in unique positions\n    filtered_words = [word for word in common_words if has_two_distinct_vowels(word)]\n    \n    # Sort the filtered words in ascending order\n    filtered_words.sort()\n    \n    return filtered_words\n\n# Example usage\nlist1 = input(\"Enter the first list of words (separated by spaces): \").split()\nlist2 = input(\"Enter the second list of words (separated by spaces): \").split()\n\nresult = get_common_words_with_vowels(list1, list2)\nprint(\"Resulting list:\", result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **has_two_distinct_vowels function**: This function checks if a word contains at least two unique vowels at different positions. It uses a set to track the positions of the vowels found in the word.\n\n- **get_common_words_with_vowels function**: This function computes the intersection of the two input lists to find common words, then filters these words using the `has_two_distinct_vowels` function, and finally sorts the list before returning it.\n\n- **Main block**: This part of the program takes input from the user in the form of space-separated words, processes these lists, and prints the resulting words that meet the criteria."
