In the context of the sentence, any specific day of the week mentioned, such as \"Monday,\" \"Tuesday,\" \"Wednesday,\" \"Thursday,\" \"Friday,\" \"Saturday,\" or \"Sunday,\" deserves capitalization. This is because days of the week are considered proper nouns, and proper nouns are always capitalized in English.\n\n### Grammatical Rules:\n1. **Proper Nouns**: Days of the week are proper nouns, and according to English grammar rules, all proper nouns should be capitalized.\n2. **Sentence Structure**: Even if a day of the week appears in the middle or at the end of a sentence, it should still be capitalized.\n3. **Consistency**: Always capitalize days of the week, irrespective of their usage in different parts of a sentence.\n\n### Examples:\n1. **Simple Sentence**: \"We will meet on Tuesday.\"\n   - Here, \"Tuesday\" is capitalized because it is a proper noun.\n\n2. **Question Form**: \"Did you remember that our appointment is on Friday?\"\n   - In this question, \"Friday\" is capitalized for the same reason.\n\n3. **Compound Sentence**: \"I have a meeting on Wednesday, and I\u2019ll be free on Thursday.\"\n   - Both \"Wednesday\" and \"Thursday\" are capitalized as they are proper nouns.\n\n4. **In a List**: \"The workshop will be held on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.\"\n   - Each day mentioned in the list is capitalized.\n\n5. **Start of a Sentence**: \"Sunday is my favorite day of the week.\"\n   - \"Sunday\" is capitalized because it is the first word of the sentence and a proper noun.\n\nBy following these rules, you ensure correct grammatical usage and consistency in writing."
