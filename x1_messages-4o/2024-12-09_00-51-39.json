I'm currently using a combination of `dict.update()` and `dict.fromkeys()` to accomplish this, as shown below:\n```python\nmyDict = {}\nmyDict.update(dict.fromkeys(['a', 'c', 'd'], 10))\nmyDict.update(dict.fromkeys(['b', 'e'], 20))\n```\nI'm attempting to simplify this for novice users, and I would like to use a syntax such as:\n```python\nmyDict = {}\nmyDict['a', 'c', 'd'] = 10\nmyDict['b', 'e'] = 20\n```\nHowever, this results in a dictionary with tuples as keys:\n```python\nmyDict = {('a', 'c', 'd'): 10, ('b', 'e'): 20}\n```\nIs there a way to simplify the use of `dict.update()` and `dict.fromkeys()` to achieve the desired dictionary structure? Or, if I have a dictionary with tuple keys, is there an easy way to perform a lookup such as `myDict['c']` or `myDict.get('c')` and get the value 10?"

        "content": "To assign the same value to multiple keys in a Python dictionary in a more simplified manner, you can create a utility function to handle this for you. Here's an example approach:\n\n```python\ndef assign_values_to_keys(d, keys, value):\n    for key in keys:\n        d[key] = value\n\nmyDict = {}\nassign_values_to_keys(myDict, ['a', 'c', 'd'], 10)\nassign_values_to_keys(myDict, ['b', 'e'], 20)\n\n# Now myDict should be: {'a': 10, 'c': 10, 'd': 10, 'b': 20, 'e': 20}\n```\n\nThis solution uses a simple function to iterate over the list of keys and assign the specified value to each key in the dictionary. This makes the code more readable and user-friendly, especially for novice users.\n\nRegarding the second part of your question, if you have a dictionary with tuple keys, performing a lookup for an individual element like `myDict['c']` won't work directly because the keys are tuples. You would need to iterate over the dictionary and check if the element belongs to any of the tuple keys, like so:\n\n```python\ndef lookup_value_by_element(d, element):\n    for keys, value in d.items():\n        if element in keys:\n            return value\n    return None\n\n# Example usage\nmyDict = {('a', 'c', 'd'): 10, ('b', 'e'): 20}\nvalue = lookup_value_by_element(myDict, 'c')  # This will return 10\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each tuple key in the dictionary, checks if the element is part of the tuple, and returns the corresponding value. It's a bit more complex than using individual keys, but it's a way to handle lookups in a dictionary with tuple keys."
