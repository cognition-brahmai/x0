        "content": "The \"CSRF Failed: CSRF cookie not set\" error typically occurs when you're making state-changing requests (like POST, PUT, DELETE) without a proper CSRF token, which is a security feature to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks. In the context of Django REST Framework (DRF) and API calls, especially when dealing with non-browser clients like iOS apps, CSRF protection can be disabled or handled differently since these clients often do not maintain sessions or handle cookies in the same way browsers do.\n\nHere are some steps to address the issue:\n\n1. **Remove CSRF Exemption Decorator:**\n   If you're building an API intended for non-browser clients, you generally don't need CSRF protection, so you can remove the `@csrf_exempt` decorator entirely. Instead, configure the settings appropriately.\n\n2. **Use `SessionAuthentication` Carefully:**\n   If you're using `SessionAuthentication`, it requires CSRF checks. For APIs, it's often recommended to use `TokenAuthentication` or `JWT Authentication` instead. You can set this in your Django REST Framework settings:\n\n   ```python\n   REST_FRAMEWORK = {\n       'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [\n           'rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication',\n           # or 'rest_framework_simplejwt.authentication.JWTAuthentication',\n       ],\n       'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [\n           'rest_framework.permissions.AllowAny',\n       ],\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Configure CSRF Middleware:**\n   If you need CSRF protection for some reason (e.g., you're also serving web pages), you can disable it specifically for API endpoints by customizing the middleware. However, typically for APIs, you'd handle authentication differently as mentioned above.\n\n4. **Consider using `APIView` Correctly:**\n   The `APIView` class-based views in Django REST Framework already integrate well with DRF's authentication and permission systems. Ensure your API view is set up correctly without the need for explicit CSRF exemptions.\n\n5. **CSRF Middleware Bypass:**\n   If you still need to bypass CSRF checks for specific views, consider using `@csrf_exempt` sparingly and only when there's no viable alternative. It's generally safer to configure authentication and permissions properly as per REST standards.\n\n6. **For Development Only:**\n   If you're in a development environment and just need a quick workaround, you can disable CSRF checks globally, but remember this is not recommended for production:\n\n   ```python\n   MIDDLEWARE = [\n       # other middleware,\n       'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',\n   ]\n\n   CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = False\n   ```\n\nBy setting up token-based authentication or JWT, you can manage authentication without relying on session-based CSRF mechanisms, making your API more suitable for mobile and other non-browser clients."
