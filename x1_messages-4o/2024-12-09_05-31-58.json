When I attempt to import QtGui using the code \"from PyQt5 import QtGui\", it results in an error stating \"AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'QMainWindow'\". I attempted to resolve the issue by changing the import statement to \"from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QtGui\", but was met with an error stating \"ImportError: cannot import name QtGui\". I also tried adjusting the sys.path according to a workaround I found on a Stack Overflow post, but it didn't resolve the issue. Interestingly, when I attempt to import QtGui in IDLE, it autocompletes with QMovie and other attributes, but QMainWindow and QDialog are missing. Why might this be happening and how can I resolve it?"

        "content": "The transition from PyQt4 to PyQt5 involves some significant changes, particularly in how modules and classes are organized. In PyQt5, several classes that were previously part of the `QtGui` module have been moved to the `QtWidgets` module. This includes `QMainWindow` and `QDialog`, among others.\n\nHere's how you can resolve the issues you're facing:\n\n1. **Importing `QMainWindow` and `QDialog`:** Since these classes are now part of the `QtWidgets` module, you need to import them from there. Replace your import statements as follows:\n\n   ```python\n   from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QMainWindow, QDialog\n   ```\n\n2. **Importing Other Classes:** If you need classes that are still part of `QtGui`, you can import them directly from `QtGui`. For example, if you need `QMovie`:\n\n   ```python\n   from PyQt5.QtGui import QMovie\n   ```\n\n3. **Understanding the Module Changes:**\n   - `QtWidgets`: Contains all the widget-related classes like `QMainWindow`, `QWidget`, `QDialog`, etc.\n   - `QtGui`: Contains GUI-related classes like `QPixmap`, `QPainter`, `QColor`, etc.\n   - `QtCore`: Contains core non-GUI classes like `QTimer`, `QThread`, and signal-slot functionality.\n\n4. **Example Code:**\n\n   Here\u2019s a small example to illustrate the correct imports in PyQt5:\n\n   ```python\n   from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow, QDialog\n   from PyQt5.QtGui import QIcon\n\n   class MyMainWindow(QMainWindow):\n       def __init__(self):\n           super().__init__()\n           self.setWindowTitle(\"My Main Window\")\n           self.setGeometry(200, 200, 400, 300)\n           self.setWindowIcon(QIcon('path/to/icon.png'))\n\n   app = QApplication([])\n   window = MyMainWindow()\n   window.show()\n   app.exec_()\n   ```\n\n5. **Check Your PyQt5 Installation:**\n   Ensure that your PyQt5 installation is complete and not corrupted. You can do this by reinstalling PyQt5:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall PyQt5\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the import errors and transition more smoothly from PyQt4 to PyQt5."
