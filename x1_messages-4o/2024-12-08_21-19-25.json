        "content": "Certainly! You can calculate the total number of animals in a shelter by simply summing up the quantities of each type of animal. Here is a simple Java code snippet that accomplishes this:\n\n```java\npublic class AnimalShelter {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Number of each type of animal in the shelter\n        int numberOfCats = 15;\n        int numberOfDogs = 10;\n        int numberOfRabbits = 7;\n\n        // Calculate the total number of animals\n        int totalAnimals = numberOfCats + numberOfDogs + numberOfRabbits;\n\n        // Print the result\n        System.out.println(\"Total number of animals in the shelter: \" + totalAnimals);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code defines three integer variables for the number of cats, dogs, and rabbits. It then calculates the total by adding these numbers together and prints the result to the console. When you run this program, it will output the total number of animals in the shelter."
