For instance, if I use the following code:\n\n```python\nimport ConfigParser\nwith open('./config.ini', 'w') as f:\n    conf = ConfigParser.ConfigParser()\n    conf.set('DEFAULT', 'test', 1)\n    conf.write(f)\n```\n\nThis results in a file like:\n\n```\n[DEFAULT]\ntest = 1\n```\n\nBut I would like to have a file with comments inside the `[DEFAULT]` section, like:\n\n```\n[DEFAULT]\n; test comment\ntest = 1\n```\n\nI am aware that I can write comments to files like this:\n\n```python\nimport ConfigParser\nwith open('./config.ini', 'w') as f:\n    conf = ConfigParser.ConfigParser()\n    conf.set('DEFAULT', 'test', 1)\n    conf.write(f)\n    f.write('; test comment') # but this gets printed after the section key-value pairs\n```\n\nHowever, this approach writes the comment after the section key-value pairs. Is it possible to achieve this using ConfigParser? I prefer not to use another module as I want to keep my program as \"stock\" as possible."

        "content": "The `ConfigParser` module in Python does not natively support writing comments directly within sections when writing out to a file. However, you can achieve this by manually modifying the file after the configuration has been written. Here's a workaround to insert comments within the `[DEFAULT]` section or any other section by writing the comments to the file before writing the configuration:\n\n```python\nimport configparser\n\n# Initialize the ConfigParser\nconf = configparser.ConfigParser()\n\n# Set a value in the DEFAULT section\nconf['DEFAULT'] = {'test': '1'}\n\n# Define the comment you want to add\ncomment = \"; test comment\\n\"\n\n# Write the configuration to a file with comments\nwith open('./config.ini', 'w') as f:\n    # Write the section header manually\n    f.write('[DEFAULT]\\n')\n    # Write the comment\n    f.write(comment)\n    # Write the rest of the configuration\n    conf.write(f)\n\n```\n\nIn this solution, the section header `[DEFAULT]` and the comment `; test comment` are manually written to the file before using `conf.write(f)` to append the remaining configuration. This way, you can maintain the standard library usage without needing additional modules.\n\nIf you need to add comments to multiple sections, you can apply similar logic by manually writing section headers and comments before invoking `conf.write(f)` for each section."
