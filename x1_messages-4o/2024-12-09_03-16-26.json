However, I am aware that if I push this file to GitHub, the sensitive information will become publicly available, which is undesired. I don't want to store the information in a datastore as it doesn't fit the project's requirement. Instead, I am looking for a way to swap out the values from a file that is listed in `.gitignore` on each deployment of the app. Here is my current `app.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\napplication: myapp\nversion: 3 \nruntime: python27\napi_version: 1\nthreadsafe: true\n\nlibraries:\n- name: webapp2\n  version: latest\n- name: jinja2\n  version: latest\n\nhandlers:\n- url: /static\n  static_dir: static\n\n- url: /.*\n  script: main.application  \n  login: required\n  secure: always\n# auth_fail_action: unauthorized\n\nenv_variables:\n  CLIENT_ID: ${CLIENT_ID}\n  CLIENT_SECRET: ${CLIENT_SECRET}\n  ORG: ${ORG}\n  ACCESS_TOKEN: ${ACCESS_TOKEN}\n  SESSION_SECRET: ${SESSION_SECRET}\n```\n\nDo you have any suggestions on how I can achieve this?"

        "content": "To securely manage sensitive information like API keys and environment variables without exposing them in your `app.yaml` file, you can use a combination of environment variable management and deployment scripts. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you could achieve this:\n\n### Step 1: Use a Separate Configuration File\n\n1. **Create a separate configuration file** (e.g., `config.env`) to store your sensitive information. This file should be listed in your `.gitignore` to ensure it is not pushed to your version control system.\n\n   Example `config.env`:\n   ```bash\n   CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   ORG=your_org\n   ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token\n   SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret\n   ```\n\n2. **Add `config.env` to `.gitignore`:**\n   ```\n   config.env\n   ```\n\n### Step 2: Use a Deployment Script\n\nCreate a deployment script (e.g., `deploy.sh`) to read the environment variables from `config.env` and set them in the `app.yaml` file or during the deployment process.\n\nExample `deploy.sh` script:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Load environment variables from config.env\nexport $(grep -v '^#' config.env | xargs)\n\n# Deploy to App Engine with the environment variables\ngcloud app deploy app.yaml --set-env-vars=CLIENT_ID=$CLIENT_ID,CLIENT_SECRET=$CLIENT_SECRET,ORG=$ORG,ACCESS_TOKEN=$ACCESS_TOKEN,SESSION_SECRET=$SESSION_SECRET --quiet\n```\n\n### Step 3: Use the Deployment Script\n\n1. **Run the deployment script** whenever you deploy your application to Google App Engine:\n\n   ```bash\n   bash deploy.sh\n   ```\n\nThis approach allows you to keep your sensitive information secure and out of version control while still being able to inject them as environment variables during the deployment process."
