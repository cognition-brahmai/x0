How can I do this?"

        "content": "To extract the missing key from a `KeyError` exception in Python, you need to access the arguments of the exception. The missing key is typically stored as the first element in the `args` attribute of the exception. Here's how you can modify your code to extract and print the missing key:\n\n```python\nmyDict = {'key1': 'value1'}\ntry:\n    x1 = myDict['key1']\n    x2 = myDict['key2']\nexcept KeyError as e:\n    missing_key = e.args[0]  # Extracting the missing key from the KeyError\n    print(f\"The missing key is: {missing_key}\")\n```\n\nIn this code, `e.args[0]` will contain the key that caused the `KeyError`, which in your case is `'key2'`. This approach should work as expected, allowing you to capture and use the missing key as needed."
