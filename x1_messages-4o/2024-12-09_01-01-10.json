I am considering creating a form in the view and accessing its dictionary of values/labels. Is this the best or only approach?"

        "content": "To retrieve the old display value for a choice field in Django, you can use a method similar to `get_FOO_display()`, which Django provides to get the display value of a choice field. However, since you want to retrieve the old value before it was changed and saved, you need to keep track of the old status separately.\n\nHere\u2019s one approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Track the Old Status Value:**\n\n   Before updating the status, store the current status in a variable. This way, you can still access the old value even after updating the field.\n\n   ```python\n   # Get the current status display before changing\n   old_display_value = f.get_status_display()\n\n   # Now change the status\n   f.status = 'A'\n   f.save()\n\n   # You can still access old_display_value here\n   print(old_display_value)  # Outputs: Pending\n   ```\n\n2. **Using a Custom Method:**\n\n   If you need to do this frequently, consider creating a custom method in your model to facilitate this process. Here's how you can do it:\n\n   ```python\n   class File(models.Model):\n       status = models.CharField(max_length=1, default='P', choices=FILE_STATUS_CHOICES)\n\n       def get_display_value(self, status_code):\n           # Create a dictionary from the choices\n           status_dict = dict(self.FILE_STATUS_CHOICES)\n           return status_dict.get(status_code, '')\n\n   # Usage\n   f = File()\n   old_status = f.status\n   old_display_value = f.get_display_value(old_status)\n\n   f.status = 'A'\n   f.save()\n\n   print(old_display_value)  # Outputs: Pending\n   ```\n\n3. **Using Django's Built-in Methods:**\n\n   If you are working within a form context, you can leverage Django's form instance to directly access the display value for the field. However, this is usually more applicable when dealing with forms directly.\n\nBy keeping track of the old status before changing it, you can always access the corresponding display value using the dictionary approach or a custom method as shown above. This is a simple and effective way to retrieve the named values of a choice field in Django."
