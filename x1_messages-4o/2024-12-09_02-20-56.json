The function should be called multiple times with different indices and return different values. I am currently using the `fromfunction` method but it seems that the function is only called once, and seems to return the entire array as a result, rather than the expected int type. Here is my current code:\n\n```python\nfrom numpy import *\n\ndef sum_of_indices(x, y, z):\n    # What type are X, Y and Z ? Expect int or duck-type equivalent.\n    # Getting 3 individual arrays\n    print \"Value of X is:\"\n    print x\n    print \"Type of X is:\", type(x)\n    return x + y + z\n\na = fromfunction(sum_of_indices, (2, 2, 2))\n```\n\nHow can I correctly populate an array based on multiple calls to a function of the indices?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering arises because the `fromfunction` method in NumPy is designed to apply the provided function to entire arrays of indices, rather than iterating over individual index tuples. This means that `x`, `y`, and `z` in your `sum_of_indices` function are actually arrays themselves, not individual indices.\n\nTo achieve the desired behavior where the function is called with individual indices, you can use `numpy.ndindex`, `numpy.empty`, or a simple nested loop to iterate over the indices and populate the array. Here\u2019s how you can do it using `numpy.ndindex`:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef sum_of_indices(x, y, z):\n    return x + y + z\n\n# Define the shape of the array\nshape = (2, 2, 2)\n\n# Create an empty array with the desired shape\na = np.empty(shape, dtype=int)\n\n# Use ndindex to iterate over each index in the array\nfor index in np.ndindex(shape):\n    a[index] = sum_of_indices(*index)\n\nprint(a)\n```\n\nIn this approach, `np.ndindex(shape)` generates all possible index tuples for the given shape, and the function `sum_of_indices` is called for each index tuple, allowing you to populate the array with the desired values."
