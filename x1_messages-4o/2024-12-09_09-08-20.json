        "content": "Creating a Python class to represent a 2-D point and implementing a method to calculate the Euclidean distance between two points is a great way to practice object-oriented programming. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nclass Point2D:\n    def __init__(self, x, y):\n        \"\"\"Initialize a point with x and y coordinates.\"\"\"\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n\n    def distance_to(self, other_point):\n        \"\"\"Calculate the Euclidean distance between this point and another point.\"\"\"\n        dx = self.x - other_point.x\n        dy = self.y - other_point.y\n        return math.sqrt(dx ** 2 + dy ** 2)\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        \"\"\"Return a string representation of the point.\"\"\"\n        return f\"Point({self.x}, {self.y})\"\n\n# Example usage:\npoint1 = Point2D(1, 2)\npoint2 = Point2D(4, 6)\ndistance = point1.distance_to(point2)\nprint(f\"The distance between {point1} and {point2} is {distance:.2f}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Initialization (`__init__` method):** The class `Point2D` has an initializer that takes two parameters, `x` and `y`, to set the coordinates of the point.\n- **Euclidean Distance Calculation (`distance_to` method):** The method `distance_to` takes another `Point2D` object as its parameter and calculates the Euclidean distance using the formula \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\).\n- **String Representation (`__str__` method):** This method provides a human-readable string representation of the point, which is useful for printing and debugging.\n\nThis setup allows you to create instances of `Point2D` and calculate distances between them easily."
