There are duplicate entries based on the character and I want to merge these duplicates and add the associated integer values. For instance, if I have the following list:\n\n```python\noriginal_list = [['a', 1], ['b', 1], ['a', 1], ['b', 1], ['b', 2], ['c', 2], ['b', 3]]\n```\n\nI want to end up with this:\n\n```python\nideal_output = [['a', 2], ['b', 7], ['c', 2]]\n```\n\nI have some code that can find the duplicate values based on the first element of each nested list but I am not sure how to merge the duplicates and add the associated values. Can you help?"

        "content": "Certainly! To achieve the desired output, you can use a dictionary to accumulate the sums of the integers associated with each character. Then, you can convert the dictionary back into a list of lists. Here's how you can do it in Python 2.7:\n\n```python\noriginal_list = [['a', 1], ['b', 1], ['a', 1], ['b', 1], ['b', 2], ['c', 2], ['b', 3]]\n\n# Create a dictionary to store the sum of integers for each character\nsum_dict = {}\n\n# Iterate over each sublist in the original list\nfor char, number in original_list:\n    if char in sum_dict:\n        sum_dict[char] += number  # Add the number to the existing sum\n    else:\n        sum_dict[char] = number  # Initialize with the current number\n\n# Convert the dictionary back to a list of lists\nideal_output = [[char, total] for char, total in sum_dict.items()]\n\nprint(ideal_output)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, you'll get the desired output:\n\n```\n[['a', 2], ['b', 7], ['c', 2]]\n```\n\nThis approach efficiently accumulates the sums for each character and then constructs the final list with the accumulated results."
