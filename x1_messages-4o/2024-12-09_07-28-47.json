        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to the `pandas` library. In version 0.20.0 and later, `pandas` removed the `computation` module, which has led to the `AttributeError` you're seeing. Here are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Update Dask**: The error seems to originate from the `dask` library, which might be using an outdated API call to `pandas`. Update `dask` to ensure compatibility with the latest `pandas` version.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade dask\n   ```\n\n2. **Downgrade Pandas**: If updating `dask` doesn't resolve the issue, consider downgrading `pandas` to a version that still includes the `computation` module, such as 0.19.2.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pandas==0.19.2\n   ```\n\n3. **Check for Compatibility**: Ensure that all other libraries in your environment are compatible with the versions of `pandas`, `dask`, and `tensorflow` you are using. Sometimes, a mismatch in versions can cause such issues.\n\n4. **Alternative Imports**: If you absolutely need to use the latest versions, you might need to modify the `dask` source (or any other dependent library) to remove or modify the line causing the issue. This is more of a workaround and might not be ideal for production code.\n\n5. **Environment Isolation**: Consider using a virtual environment or `conda` to create isolated environments for different projects. This way, you can maintain separate dependencies for projects that have conflicting requirements.\n\n6. **Check Release Notes and Issues**: Sometimes, specific issues are known and documented by the library maintainers. Checking the GitHub issues page or the release notes for `dask` and `pandas` might provide additional insights or solutions.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `AttributeError` and successfully import the `Sequential` model from Keras in your environment."
