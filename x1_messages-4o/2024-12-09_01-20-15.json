Because of the dependencies on other things, the 'add model' action in Django admin throws a 500 from a custom queryset. Is there a way to disable the 'Add $MODEL' functionality for certain models? Specifically, I want accessing '/admin/appname/modelname/add/' to return a 404 or a suitable 'go away' error message, and I don't want the 'Add $MODELNAME' button to appear on the '/admin/appname/modelname' view. Django admin does provide a way to disable admin actions (http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/actions/#disabling-actions), however, the only action for this model is 'delete_selected', meaning the admin actions only act on existing models. Is there a Django-esque way to accomplish this?"

        "content": "Yes, you can disable the \"Add\" functionality for specific models in Django's admin interface by customizing the `ModelAdmin` class for those models. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n1. **Override the `has_add_permission` Method**: You can override the `has_add_permission` method in your `ModelAdmin` class to return `False`. This will prevent the \"Add\" button from appearing in the admin interface for that model.\n\n2. **Handle Direct URL Access**: To prevent users from accessing the \"add\" page directly via URL, you can override the `get_urls` method in your `ModelAdmin` class to return a 404 for the add view.\n\nHere is an example of how you can implement these steps:\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom django.urls import path\nfrom django.http import HttpResponseNotFound\nfrom .models import YourModel\n\nclass YourModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    # Disable the 'Add' button\n    def has_add_permission(self, request):\n        return False\n\n    # Return a 404 error for direct URL access to the add page\n    def get_urls(self):\n        urls = super().get_urls()\n        custom_urls = [\n            path('add/', self.admin_site.admin_view(self.add_view_not_allowed))\n        ]\n        return custom_urls + urls\n\n    def add_view_not_allowed(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n        return HttpResponseNotFound('This page is not available.')\n\nadmin.site.register(YourModel, YourModelAdmin)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`has_add_permission`**: By overriding this method to return `False`, the \"Add\" button will not appear on the model's list view in the admin interface.\n\n- **`get_urls` and `add_view_not_allowed`**: By customizing the URLs and providing a function that returns a 404 response, you ensure that even if someone tries to access the \"add\" page directly via URL, they will receive a \"not found\" page.\n\nThis approach ensures that your admin interface behaves as desired without displaying the \"Add\" functionality for certain models."
