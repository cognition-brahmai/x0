Here is my current code:\n\n```python\nlist = [\"gathi-109\",\"itcg-0932\",\"mx1-35316\"]\nset_1 = set(list)\nset_2 = set([\"mx1-35316\"])\nset_3 = set_1 - set_2\nprint set_3.join(\", \")\n```\n\nWhen I run this code, I encounter an `AttributeError: 'set' object has no attribute 'join'`. What is the equivalent function for joining elements of a set into a single string?"

        "content": "In Python, the `join()` method is a string method that can be used to concatenate the elements of an iterable (like a list, set, or tuple) into a single string, using a specified separator. However, you need to call `join()` on a string that will act as the separator, rather than directly on the set.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to join the elements of a set:\n\n```python\nlist = [\"gathi-109\", \"itcg-0932\", \"mx1-35316\"]\nset_1 = set(list)\nset_2 = set([\"mx1-35316\"])\nset_3 = set_1 - set_2\n\n# Convert the set to a sorted list before joining\nresult_string = \", \".join(sorted(set_3))\nprint(result_string)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Join Method**: Use the `join()` method on a string (the separator), and pass the iterable (like a list or set) as an argument to `join()`.\n\n2. **Sorting**: Sets are unordered collections, so if you want the elements in a specific order, you might want to convert the set to a list and sort it before joining.\n\n3. **Syntax**: Make sure to use parentheses `()` in `print()` as it is a function in Python 3.\n\nBy using `sorted(set_3)`, you ensure that the items are joined in a sorted order, although this step is optional if order doesn't matter for your use case."
