        "content": "To build an AI algorithm in R to determine if a given number is prime or composite, you can use a straightforward approach by implementing a simple function that checks the divisibility of a number. While this doesn't involve traditional AI techniques, it serves the purpose efficiently. Here's a basic example of how you can do it:\n\n```r\nis_prime <- function(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) {\n    return(FALSE)\n  }\n  if (n == 2) {\n    return(TRUE)\n  }\n  if (n %% 2 == 0) {\n    return(FALSE)\n  }\n  for (i in 3:sqrt(n)) {\n    if (n %% i == 0) {\n      return(FALSE)\n    }\n  }\n  return(TRUE)\n}\n\ncheck_prime_status <- function(n) {\n  if (is_prime(n)) {\n    return(paste(n, \"is a prime number.\"))\n  } else {\n    return(paste(n, \"is a composite number.\"))\n  }\n}\n\n# Example usage\nnumber <- 29\nresult <- check_prime_status(number)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Function `is_prime`:** \n   - It first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, in which case it is not prime.\n   - It checks if the number is 2, which is the only even prime number.\n   - If the number is even and greater than 2, it is composite.\n   - For odd numbers greater than 2, it checks divisibility from 3 up to the square root of the number. If any divisor is found, the number is composite.\n\n2. **Function `check_prime_status`:**\n   - It uses the `is_prime` function to determine whether the number is prime or composite and returns a message accordingly.\n\nThis algorithm is efficient for small to moderate-sized numbers. For very large numbers, more sophisticated algorithms like the Miller-Rabin primality test or AKS primality test can be implemented, but these are more complex and beyond the scope of a simple example."
