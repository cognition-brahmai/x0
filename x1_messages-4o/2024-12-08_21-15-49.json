The generated passwords must meet the latest cybersecurity standards and be resistant to brute force attacks and dictionary-based attacks. Please provide a [Ruby code] as input code to create such a password generator using the following formula:\nsecure_password = [*'0'..'9',*'A'..'Z',*'a'..'z',*'!',*'@',*'#',*'$',*'%',*'^',*'&',*'*',*'(',*')',*'-',*'_',*'+',*'=',*'?',*'<',*'>',*'[',*']',*'{',*'}',*'|',*';',*':',*'.',*'/'].sample(20).join + \"PersonalizedPhraseOrWord\"\nThis code will generate a random password with 20 characters including a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, and then add the user's personalized phrase or word to the end of the password. The password generated by this code will be secure and resistant to brute force attacks and dictionary-based attacks."

        "content": "To create a secure password generator in Ruby that meets the specified requirements, you can use the following approach. The code will generate a random password with 20 characters, which includes uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It will also allow the user to append a personalized phrase or word to the generated password. This combination will help make the password resistant to brute force and dictionary-based attacks.\n\nHere's a Ruby script to achieve this:\n\n```ruby\ndef generate_secure_password(personalized_phrase = \"\")\n  # Define the character set for the password\n  charset = [*'0'..'9', *'A'..'Z', *'a'..'z', *'!', *'@', *'#', *'$', *'%', *'^', *'&', *'*', *'(', *')', *'-', *'_', *'+', *'=', *'?', *'<', *'>', *'[', *']', *'{', *'}', *'|', *';', *':', *'.', *'/']\n\n  # Generate a random password with 20 characters from the charset\n  secure_password = Array.new(20) { charset.sample }.join\n\n  # Append the personalized phrase or word\n  secure_password += personalized_phrase\n\n  secure_password\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nputs \"Enter your personalized phrase or word (optional):\"\npersonalized_phrase = gets.chomp\n\npassword = generate_secure_password(personalized_phrase)\nputs \"Your secure password is: #{password}\"\n```\n\n### Key Features:\n- **Character Set**: The character set includes numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and a variety of special characters to ensure complexity.\n- **Random Generation**: The `Array.new(20) { charset.sample }.join` part randomly selects 20 characters from the character set.\n- **Personalization**: The user can input a personalized phrase or word, which is appended to the generated password.\n- **User Input**: The script allows for optional user input for personalization.\n\n### Considerations:\n- **Length**: Ensure the final password length and complexity meet your security requirements.\n- **Security**: The use of `sample` ensures randomness, but for further security (e.g., cryptographic applications), consider using a secure random generator like `SecureRandom` from Ruby's standard library.\n- **Password Management**: Encourage users to store their passwords safely, possibly using a password manager.\n\nThis script provides a balance between user customization and strong security practices."
