        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"Received unregistered task of type 'tasks.add'\", is usually indicative of a configuration or import issue. Here are a few steps to help troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Task Registration**:\n   Make sure that the Celery worker is starting with the correct configuration and that it knows about your tasks. The task needs to be registered with the Celery app.\n\n2. **Define a Celery App**:\n   You should define a Celery app in `tasks.py` and use that app to create tasks. Here's how you can modify your `tasks.py`:\n\n   ```python\n   # tasks.py\n   from celery import Celery\n\n   app = Celery('tasks', broker='amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672//')\n\n   @app.task\n   def add(x, y):\n       return x + y\n   ```\n\n3. **Update Celery Configuration**:\n   Ensure your `celeryconfig.py` is properly configured and that your Celery instance is using it. You don't need to specify the broker URL in both `celeryconfig.py` and the Celery app initialization. If you prefer using the config file:\n\n   ```python\n   # celeryconfig.py\n   broker_url = \"amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672//\"\n   result_backend = \"rpc://\"\n   imports = (\"tasks\", )\n   ```\n\n   You can then apply this configuration in your `tasks.py`:\n\n   ```python\n   from celery import Celery\n\n   app = Celery('tasks')\n   app.config_from_object('celeryconfig')\n\n   @app.task\n   def add(x, y):\n       return x + y\n   ```\n\n4. **Start Celery Worker**:\n   When starting the Celery worker, ensure it's using the correct app. Run your worker like this:\n\n   ```bash\n   celery -A tasks worker --loglevel=info\n   ```\n\n5. **Run the Task**:\n   Make sure that `run_task.py` is importing the task correctly:\n\n   ```python\n   # run_task.py\n   from tasks import add\n\n   result = add.delay(4, 4)\n   print(result.id)\n   print(result.ready())\n   print(result.get(timeout=10))  # Add a timeout to avoid hanging\n   ```\n\n6. **Check for Import Errors**:\n   Ensure that there are no import errors when you start the Celery worker or when running your script. These errors might prevent tasks from being registered.\n\n7. **Verify Broker**:\n   Make sure the RabbitMQ server is running on `localhost:5672` and accessible with the provided credentials.\n\nAfter making these adjustments, try running the worker and the task again. These changes should help ensure that the task is registered and can be executed by the Celery worker."
