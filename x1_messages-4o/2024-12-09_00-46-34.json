However, I am having an issue with the column name \"IAS_liss\u00e9\" which is not interpreted correctly by the pd.read_csv() method and instead, it's being returned as \ufffd. I am not sure why this character is being returned. This issue is causing a bug in my Flask application. Is there a way to correctly read this column without modifying the file?\n\nCode illustrating the issue:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\npd.read_csv(\"Openhealth_S-Grippal.csv\",delimiter=\";\").columns\n```\nThe output I get is:\n```\nIndex([u'PERIODE', u'IAS_brut', u'IAS_liss\ufffd', u'Incidence_Sentinelles'], dtype='object')\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely due to an encoding problem. The `pd.read_csv()` method defaults to using the UTF-8 encoding, but your CSV file might be using a different encoding, such as ISO-8859-1 (also known as Latin-1) or Windows-1252, which are common for files that include special characters.\n\nTo solve this problem, you can specify the encoding parameter in the `pd.read_csv()` function to correctly interpret the special characters in your CSV file.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to include the encoding parameter:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Try with ISO-8859-1 encoding\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"Openhealth_S-Grippal.csv\", delimiter=\";\", encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\")\nprint(df.columns)\n```\n\nIf ISO-8859-1 doesn't work, you can try using other encodings such as \"utf-16\" or \"windows-1252\". Here's how you can do it with \"windows-1252\":\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Try with Windows-1252 encoding\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"Openhealth_S-Grippal.csv\", delimiter=\";\", encoding=\"windows-1252\")\nprint(df.columns)\n```\n\nBy specifying the correct encoding, you should be able to read the CSV file with the correct column names without modifying the file itself."
