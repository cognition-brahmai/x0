        "content": "How can I create a list of lambda objects from a list of constants in Python? I tried creating a list of lambda objects in a list comprehension, however, when running them, I expected the output to be squares from 1 to 25, but all I'm getting is 25s. It seems as though the lambdas have all been assigned the wrong parameter. Could I have made an error in my code? Is there a way to rectify this issue? Here is the code I used:\n\n```python\nlistOfNumbers = [1,2,3,4,5]\nsquare = lambda x: x * x\nlistOfLambdas = [lambda: square(i) for i in listOfNumbers]\n\nfor f in listOfLambdas:\n    print f(),\n\n# prints\n# 25 25 25 25 25\n\n# I also tried this:\n\nlistOfLambdas = []\nfor num in listOfNumbers:\n    action = lambda: square(num)\n    listOfLambdas.append(action)\n    print action()\n\n# prints the expected squares from 1 to 25, but then using the earlier print statement:\n\nfor f in listOfLambdas:\n    print f(),\n\n# still prints all 25s\n```\n\nWhy did the existing lambda objects change between those two print calls? I'm using Python 2.4."

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is related to how closures work in Python, particularly with the late binding behavior of lambda functions. In your code, the lambda function captures the variable `i` or `num` itself, not its value at the time the lambda was created. As a result, when the lambda is eventually called, it uses the current value of `i` or `num`, which is the last value in the iteration (25 in your case).\n\nTo fix this, you can use a default argument in the lambda function to bind the current value of `i` or `num` at the time the lambda is created. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired behavior:\n\n```python\nlistOfNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nsquare = lambda x: x * x\n\n# Using a default argument to capture the current value of i\nlistOfLambdas = [lambda i=i: square(i) for i in listOfNumbers]\n\nfor f in listOfLambdas:\n    print f(),\n\n# This will print:\n# 1 4 9 16 25\n\n# Alternatively, for the second approach:\n\nlistOfLambdas = []\nfor num in listOfNumbers:\n    # Capture the current value of num using a default argument\n    action = lambda num=num: square(num)\n    listOfLambdas.append(action)\n    print action()\n\nfor f in listOfLambdas:\n    print f(),\n\n# This will also print:\n# 1 4 9 16 25\n```\n\nBy using the default argument in the lambda (`i=i` or `num=num`), you ensure that each lambda function captures and retains the value of the variable at the time of its creation, rather than its final value after the loop completes. This is a common pattern to work around the late binding behavior of closures in Python."
