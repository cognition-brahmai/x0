        "content": "In OpenCV 3, the structure of the modules and constants has changed compared to OpenCV 2. The `cv` module that existed in OpenCV 2.x has been deprecated and removed. This means that the constants that were previously accessible through `cv2.cv` are now directly accessible from `cv2`.\n\nTo modify your legacy code to work with OpenCV 3, you should replace the `cv2.cv.CV_*` constants with their equivalents directly from `cv2`. For the specific case you mentioned:\n\n```python\nhsv_im = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)\n```\n\nReplace `cv2.cv.CV_BGR2HSV` with `cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV`. This is the new way to access color conversion codes in OpenCV 3.\n\nIf you have other similar constants in your legacy code, you can usually find their equivalents by removing `cv2.cv.` and using `cv2.` directly with the rest of the constant name. Here's a general guideline:\n\n- `cv2.cv.CV_XYZ` becomes `cv2.XYZ`\n\nFor example:\n- `cv2.cv.CV_BGR2GRAY` becomes `cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY`\n- `cv2.cv.CV_8UC3` becomes `cv2.CV_8UC3`\n\nBy making these adjustments, your legacy code should work properly with OpenCV 3."
