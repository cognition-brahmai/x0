        "content": "The error you're experiencing is a common issue when dealing with multiple Python environments. Here are some steps you can take to resolve it:\n\n1. **Check Your Python Environment:**\n   Make sure that the version of Python you are using in Spyder is the same version where you installed PyPDF2. Sometimes, Spyder might be using a different environment or interpreter.\n\n2. **Activate the Correct Conda Environment:**\n   If you installed PyPDF2 in a specific conda environment, make sure that you activate this environment before launching Spyder. You can activate your environment using:\n   ```bash\n   conda activate your_environment_name\n   ```\n\n3. **Launch Spyder from the Anaconda Navigator:**\n   If you are using Anaconda, it's a good idea to launch Spyder from the Anaconda Navigator. This way, it ensures that the correct environment is being used.\n\n4. **Reinstall PyPDF2 in the Correct Environment:**\n   It's possible that PyPDF2 was installed in a different environment. You can reinstall it in the active environment by running:\n   ```bash\n   conda install -n your_environment_name PyPDF2\n   ```\n   Replace `your_environment_name` with the name of your conda environment.\n\n5. **Set the Correct Interpreter in Spyder:**\n   You can configure Spyder to use the correct Python interpreter:\n   - Go to `Tools` > `Preferences`.\n   - Navigate to `Python Interpreter`.\n   - Select `Use the following Python interpreter` and browse to the Python executable in your desired environment.\n\n6. **Verify Installation in the Python Shell:**\n   Open a Python shell within the active environment and try importing PyPDF2 to ensure it's available:\n   ```bash\n   python\n   >>> import PyPDF2\n   ```\n\n7. **Check for Typos:**\n   Ensure there are no typos in your import statement. The package name is case-sensitive.\n\nIf after trying these steps the issue persists, reinstalling Spyder or creating a new conda environment might help resolve any underlying configuration issues."
