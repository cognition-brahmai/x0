After adding tags, the pretty print functionality fails to format the XML correctly. How can I get pretty printing to work properly after adding tags to the parsed XML tree?\n\nBelow is the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nfrom lxml import etree\nroot = etree.parse('file.xml').getroot()\nprint etree.tostring(root, pretty_print = True)\n\n# Output:\n<root>\n  <x>\n    <y>test1</y>\n  </x>\n</root>\n\n# Adding the tags\nx = root.find('x')\nz = etree.SubElement(x, 'z')\netree.SubElement(z, 'z1').attrib['value'] = 'val1'\nprint etree.tostring(root, pretty_print = True)\n\n# Output:\n<root>\n  <x>\n    <y>test1</y>\n  <z><z1 value=\"val1\"/></z></x>\n</root>\n```\n\nI've also tried to add the tags in reverse order, but the result is the same. The pretty print works correctly if I don't parse the file and create all the tags at once. Why does pretty print fail when I add tags to a parsed tree and how can I fix it?"

        "content": "The issue you are encountering with `pretty_print` not formatting the XML correctly after modifying the tree is likely due to the way the XML is structured in memory after modifications. When you add new elements to an existing tree, the indentation might not be automatically adjusted, leading to the observed formatting issues.\n\nTo fix this, you can use an `ElementTree` object and write the XML back to a file or a string after making modifications. This will ensure that the entire tree is re-serialized with proper formatting. Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nfrom lxml import etree\n\n# Parse the file and get the root\nparser = etree.XMLParser(remove_blank_text=True)\ntree = etree.parse('file.xml', parser)\nroot = tree.getroot()\n\n# Print the original tree with pretty print\nprint(etree.tostring(root, pretty_print=True).decode())\n\n# Adding the tags\nx = root.find('x')\nz = etree.SubElement(x, 'z')\netree.SubElement(z, 'z1').attrib['value'] = 'val1'\n\n# Print the modified tree with pretty print\nprint(etree.tostring(tree, pretty_print=True).decode())\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **XMLParser with `remove_blank_text=True`:** This ensures that whitespace within the XML is handled correctly, preventing unnecessary spaces from interfering with the formatting.\n\n2. **Using `etree.ElementTree`:** Instead of working directly with the root, use an `ElementTree` object. This helps in managing the XML structure more effectively, especially when modifications are made.\n\n3. **Re-serialization:** By converting the entire tree back into a string (or writing it to a file), you ensure that the pretty print functionality formats the entire XML document correctly.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to maintain proper formatting even after adding new elements to an existing XML tree."
