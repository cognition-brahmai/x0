However, I am getting a `ConnectionError`. Interestingly, the server does receive the data from the client and prints it to console, but I'm not sure how this is possible given the error. How can I resolve this issue?\n\nHere is my client code:\n\n```python\ndef post_data():\n    \"\"\"Client method\"\"\"\n    json_data = {\n        'sender': 'User',\n        'receiver': 'MY_SERVER',\n        'message': 'Hello server! Sending some data.'\n    }\n    data_headers = {'Content-type': 'application/json', 'Accept': 'text/plain'}\n    data_payload = json.dumps(json_data)\n\n    try:\n        post = requests.post('http://localhost:8080/post', data=data_payload,\n                             headers=data_headers)\n        print(post.status_code)\n    except ConnectionError as e:\n        print(\"CONNECTION ERROR: \")\n        print(e)\n```\n\nAnd here is my server code:\n\n```python\ndef do_POST(self):\n    \"\"\"Server method\"\"\"\n    self.send_response(200)\n    print(\"Receiving new data ...\")\n    content_length = int(self.headers['Content-Length'])\n    post_data = self.rfile.read(content_length)\n    print(post_data)\n```\n\nThis results in the following server output:\n\n```shell\nC:\\Users\\mypc\\Projects\\PythonFiles\\httpserver>python server.py\n\nFri Jan  5 01:09:12 2018: HTTP Server started on port 8080.\n127.0.0.1 - - [05/Jan/2018 01:09:21] \"POST /post HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\nReceiving new data ...\nb'{\"sender\": \"User\", \"receiver\": \"MY_SERVER\", \"message\": \"Hello server! Sending some data.\"}'\n```\n\nAnd the following client output:\n\n```shell\nC:\\Users\\mypc\\Projects\\PythonFiles\\httpserver>python client.py\nCONNECTION ERROR:\n('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response',))\n\nC:\\Users\\mypc\\Projects\\PythonFiles\\httpserver>\n```\n\nIf I remove the exception block, I get this traceback:\n\n```shell\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"C:\\Python36\\lib\\site-packages\\urllib3\\connectionpool.py\", line 601, in urlopen\n    chunked=chunked)\n  ...\nrequests.exceptions.ConnectionError: ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response',))\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is related to how the HTTP response is being handled in your server code. While you are sending a response with `self.send_response(200)`, the server is not sending the required headers and ending the response properly, which results in a `ConnectionError` on the client side.\n\nTo resolve this, you need to do the following steps in your `do_POST` method to properly handle the HTTP response:\n\n1. Send the headers using `self.send_header` and `self.end_headers`.\n2. Optionally, write a response body using `self.wfile.write`.\n\nHere is how you can modify your server code:\n\n```python\nfrom http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer\nimport json\n\nclass SimpleHTTPRequestHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n    def do_POST(self):\n        \"\"\"Server method\"\"\"\n        # Send HTTP response status code.\n        self.send_response(200)\n        \n        # Send headers\n        self.send_header('Content-type', 'application/json')\n        self.end_headers()\n        \n        # Read the data from the request\n        content_length = int(self.headers['Content-Length'])\n        post_data = self.rfile.read(content_length)\n        print(\"Receiving new data ...\")\n        print(post_data)\n        \n        # Optionally send response body.\n        response = {\"status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"Data received\"}\n        self.wfile.write(json.dumps(response).encode('utf-8'))\n\ndef run(server_class=HTTPServer, handler_class=SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):\n    server_address = ('', 8080)\n    httpd = server_class(server_address, handler_class)\n    print('Starting httpd server...')\n    httpd.serve_forever()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    run()\n```\n\nThis will ensure that the server properly closes the connection after sending a complete HTTP response, which should resolve the `ConnectionError` on the client side. After these changes, your client should be able to receive a proper response from the server without encountering a `ConnectionError`."
