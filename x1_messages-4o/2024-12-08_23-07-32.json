        "content": "To analyze the time complexity of an algorithm that employs both quicksort and merge sort, you need to understand the behavior of each sorting algorithm and how they interact within your specific algorithm. Here's a breakdown of the analysis:\n\n1. **Quicksort**: \n   - Average and best-case time complexity: \\(O(n \\log n)\\)\n   - Worst-case time complexity: \\(O(n^2)\\), but with random pivot selection, the worst-case is rare.\n\n2. **Merge Sort**:\n   - Consistent time complexity: \\(O(n \\log n)\\) for all cases.\n\n3. **Hybrid Approach**:\n   - If your algorithm uses quicksort for subarrays of size greater than 10 and switches to merge sort for smaller subarrays, you are essentially using quicksort as a primary sort and merge sort as a secondary sort for efficiency in smaller data sets.\n   - The overall time complexity remains \\(O(n \\log n)\\) due to the dominance of the divide-and-conquer logic of quicksort. The switch to merge sort for small subarrays does not significantly affect the overall complexity.\n\nRegarding using an SQL database to perform this analysis, SQL is not typically used for analyzing algorithmic time complexity directly. However, you can store data related to your sorting operations in a database and perform queries to analyze performance metrics such as execution time or number of operations.\n\nSuppose you want to log the execution time of sorting operations and store them in an SQL database. Here's an example of how you might set this up:\n\n1. **Create a Table to Log Sorting Operations**:\n   ```sql\n   CREATE TABLE SortingAnalysis (\n       id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n       array_size INT,\n       sort_type VARCHAR(10),\n       execution_time DOUBLE,\n       timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n   );\n   ```\n\n2. **Log Data into the Table**:\n   You would need to do this from your application code. Below is a pseudo-code example in Python:\n\n   ```python\n   import mysql.connector\n   from random import randint, random\n   import time\n\n   # Function to simulate sorting and logging\n   def analyze_and_log_sorting(array):\n       n = len(array)\n       start_time = time.time()\n       \n       if n > 10:\n           # Apply quicksort\n           quicksort(array)\n           sort_type = \"quicksort\"\n       else:\n           # Apply merge sort\n           merge_sort(array)\n           sort_type = \"mergesort\"\n       \n       end_time = time.time()\n       execution_time = end_time - start_time\n       \n       # Connect to database and log the execution time\n       conn = mysql.connector.connect(\n           host=\"localhost\",\n           user=\"yourusername\",\n           password=\"yourpassword\",\n           database=\"yourdatabase\"\n       )\n       cursor = conn.cursor()\n       \n       cursor.execute(\"\"\"\n           INSERT INTO SortingAnalysis (array_size, sort_type, execution_time)\n           VALUES (%s, %s, %s)\n       \"\"\", (n, sort_type, execution_time))\n       \n       conn.commit()\n       cursor.close()\n       conn.close()\n\n   # Example usage\n   array = [randint(1, 100) for _ in range(randint(5, 20))]\n   analyze_and_log_sorting(array)\n   ```\n\n3. **Query the Data for Analysis**:\n   You can use various SQL queries to analyze the logged data. For example, to get the average execution time for quicksort:\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT AVG(execution_time) AS avg_time\n   FROM SortingAnalysis\n   WHERE sort_type = 'quicksort';\n   ```\n\nRemember, while SQL can help you store and query performance data, the complexity analysis is mostly theoretical and should be done outside of the database using algorithmic analysis techniques."
