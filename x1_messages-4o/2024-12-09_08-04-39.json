When I check the documentation using `help(int.numerator)`, it is described as \"the numerator of a rational number in lowest terms\". But my understanding is that `int` is not a rational number. So, I am confused as to why these properties exist for integers in Python?"

        "content": "In Python, the `int` type has attributes like `numerator` and `denominator` because every integer can be interpreted as a rational number. In mathematical terms, any integer \\( n \\) can be expressed as the rational number \\( \\frac{n}{1} \\). This means that an integer can be seen as a rational number with the denominator of 1.\n\nPython integrates this concept into its integer type to provide a consistent interface for dealing with numbers. The attributes `numerator` and `denominator` are part of the `numbers.Rational` abstract base class from which `int` inherits. This is why you see these properties on an integer object:\n\n- `int.numerator` returns the integer itself.\n- `int.denominator` returns 1.\n\nThis design allows for a consistent API when working with numbers, especially when dealing with fractions and other rational numbers, where these properties are more commonly used. This makes it easier to write code that can handle both integers and fractions in a uniform way."
