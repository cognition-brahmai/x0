I'm unable to fix the error as I can't read it. The script sends an email with an attachment using the .NET classes. It works well when I execute it directly from the command line or call it from the Windows Scheduler. However, it fails when I call it from another script (IronPython). This works perfectly on my development machine. I'm currently using Powershell 1.0 and IronPython 1.1. How can I prevent the command window from closing so I can read the error message?"

        "content": "To prevent the command window from closing immediately after the script execution, you can modify your PowerShell script or the way you are invoking it. Here are a few methods you can try:\n\n1. **Add a Pause at the End of Your Script:**\n   You can add a `Read-Host` command at the end of your PowerShell script to prompt the user to press a key before the window closes. This will give you time to read any error messages.\n\n   ```powershell\n   # Your existing script\n   # ...\n\n   # Pause at the end\n   Read-Host -Prompt \"Press Enter to exit\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Run PowerShell with the `-NoExit` Flag:**\n   When calling the PowerShell script from another script, you can use the `-NoExit` flag. This will keep the PowerShell window open after the script execution.\n\n   ```shell\n   powershell.exe -NoExit -File \"YourScript.ps1\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Redirect Output to a File:**\n   You can redirect the output and error messages to a log file. This way, you can review the log file after the execution to check for any errors.\n\n   ```powershell\n   # In your IronPython script, call PowerShell like this:\n   powershell.exe -File \"YourScript.ps1\" > output.log 2>&1\n   ```\n\n4. **Use Try-Catch for Error Handling:**\n   If you suspect there might be an error, you can wrap your script in a try-catch block to catch any exceptions and output them in a controlled manner.\n\n   ```powershell\n   try {\n       # Your existing script\n       # ...\n   } catch {\n       Write-Host \"An error occurred: $_\" -ForegroundColor Red\n       Read-Host -Prompt \"Press Enter to exit\"\n   }\n   ```\n\nBy using any of these methods, you should be able to capture and read the error messages generated by your PowerShell script, making it easier to diagnose and fix the issue you're encountering."
