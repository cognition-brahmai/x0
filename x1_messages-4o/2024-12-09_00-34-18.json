        "content": "In Django templates, you cannot use Python functions like `zip` directly. Django's template language is intentionally limited to maintain a separation between logic and presentation. However, you can achieve similar functionality by pre-zipping the lists in your view and passing the zipped list to the template context.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n### In Your Django View\n\nFirst, you need to zip the lists in your view and pass the zipped list to the template context.\n\n```python\n# Assuming you have a Django view like this\ndef my_view(request):\n    foo = ['foo', 'bar']\n    moo = ['moo', 'loo']\n    \n    # Zip the lists in the view\n    zipped_lists = zip(foo, moo)\n    \n    # Pass the zipped list to the template context\n    context = {\n        'zipped_lists': zipped_lists,\n    }\n    \n    return render(request, 'your_template.html', context)\n```\n\n### In Your Django Template\n\nNow, in your Django template, you can iterate over the zipped list.\n\n```django\n{% for a, b in zipped_lists %}\n  {{ a }}\n  {{ b }}\n{% endfor %}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **View**: By using Python's `zip` function in the view, you create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains one element from each of the two lists `foo` and `moo`.\n- **Template**: You iterate over the `zipped_lists` in the template just like you would with a single list, unpacking each tuple into variables `a` and `b` within the loop.\n\nThis approach adheres to Django's design philosophy of keeping logic out of templates while still allowing you to achieve the functionality you need."
