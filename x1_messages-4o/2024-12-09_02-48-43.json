I have an input X with dimensions (m samples, n sequences, and k features), and y labels with dimensions (m samples, 0/1). I am unsure whether the states should be reset on a per epoch basis or per sample basis. Here is an example code:\n\n```python\nfor e in epoch:\n    for m in X.shape[0]:          #for each sample\n        for n in X.shape[1]:      #for each sequence\n            #train_on_batch for model...\n            #model.reset_states()  (1) I believe this is 'stateful = False'?\n        #model.reset_states()      (2) wouldn't this make more sense?\n    #model.reset_states()          (3) This is what I usually see...\n```\nSo, should I reset the states after each sequence, after each sample or after each epoch (when all m samples in X are trained)?"

        "content": "When working with stateful LSTM models in Keras, the decision on when to reset the states depends on the specific design and requirements of your model. Let's break down the options:\n\n1. **Reset states after each sequence**: \n   - This would be appropriate if each sequence in a sample is independent of the others. This effectively makes your model behave as if `stateful=False` since it resets the state after every sequence. \n   \n2. **Reset states after each sample**:\n   - This is common when you want to keep the dependencies between sequences within a single sample but not across different samples. It allows the model to utilize the learned state across sequences of the same sample, ensuring that the context is maintained throughout the entire sample but not beyond that.\n\n3. **Reset states after each epoch**:\n   - This is useful when you want to maintain state across the entire dataset during an epoch. This approach assumes that there is some temporal or sequential dependency across samples. It's less common unless your data is inherently sequential across samples in a way that benefits from state carryover across the whole dataset.\n\nGiven your input configuration, if each sample is independent and doesn't require maintaining state across samples, option (2) (resetting after each sample) is generally preferred. This allows the model to maintain state across sequences within a single sample but resets for each new sample.\n\nHere's how you could implement it:\n\n```python\nfor e in range(num_epochs):\n    for m in range(X.shape[0]):  # for each sample\n        model.train_on_batch(X[m], y[m])\n        model.reset_states()  # Reset after each sample\n```\n\nOption (3) is more applicable if your data is inherently sequential across samples and you want to leverage the statefulness across the entire dataset. However, this approach is less common unless specifically required by the nature of your problem.\n\nUltimately, the choice depends on the nature of your data and the dependencies you need to model. If you're unsure, it might be beneficial to experiment with different reset points and evaluate which configuration provides the best performance on your validation data."
