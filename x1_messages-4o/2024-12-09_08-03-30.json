However, after running the command `./darknet detector train cfg/voc.data cfg/yolo-voc.cfg darknet19_448.conv.23`, Darknet immediately stops training and announces that weights have been written to the `backups/` directory. I tried using the `./darknet detect` command with these weights on one of the test images `data/dog` but nothing is found. The network does train without any pretrained weights. I've edited cfg/yolo-voc.cfg to use:\n\n```\n# Testing\n#batch=1\n#subdivisions=1\n# Training\nbatch=32\nsubdivisions=8\n```\n\nThe training process has been running for many hours now. Is this the intended way to train Darknet? How can I use pretrained weights correctly, without training just breaking off? Is there any setting to create checkpoints, or get an idea of the progress?"

        "content": "When training a YOLO model with Darknet on Pascal VOC data, it is important to ensure that all configurations and setups are correctly aligned. Here are some steps and tips to help you troubleshoot and correctly set up your training process:\n\n1. **Configuration Files:**\n   - Make sure the `voc.data` file is correctly set up with paths to your training, validation, and testing datasets, as well as the class names and backup directories.\n   - Verify that the `yolo-voc.cfg` file is correctly edited. The `batch` and `subdivisions` values seem appropriate for training on Pascal VOC, but ensure other settings such as `max_batches`, `steps`, `scales`, and the number of classes and filters in the last convolutional layer are correct.\n\n2. **Pretrained Weights:**\n   - Ensure that the pretrained weights file `darknet19_448.conv.23` exists and is accessible at the specified path. This file should match the network architecture up to the layer where you're starting training (i.e., before the last few layers specific to detection).\n\n3. **Checkpoints and Progress:**\n   - Darknet typically saves weights at regular intervals to the `backup` directory specified in your `.data` file. If training stops immediately, there might be an issue with your data setup or configurations.\n   - You can modify the `learning_rate` or other hyperparameters in the `.cfg` file if you're facing convergence issues.\n   - To monitor training progress, look at the console output during training. Darknet provides loss values and occasionally mAP (mean Average Precision) scores if you set up testing during training.\n\n4. **Debugging Training:**\n   - If training stops immediately, check the console output for error messages. It might provide clues about what's going wrong.\n   - Ensure your dataset is correctly formatted, with images and corresponding annotation files accessible and correctly linked in your `voc.data` file.\n\n5. **Testing Trained Weights:**\n   - If weights are saved but don't yield detections, ensure the `.cfg` file used during detection matches the one used during training.\n   - Use the correct command for testing: `./darknet detector test cfg/voc.data cfg/yolo-voc.cfg backup/yolo-voc_final.weights data/dog.jpg` (adjust paths as necessary).\n\n6. **Logs and Diagnostics:**\n   - If you want a more detailed log, consider redirecting stdout to a file during training to capture all output for later analysis.\n\nIf you follow these steps and still encounter issues, it might help to look at forums or communities specific to YOLO and Darknet where others might have faced similar issues."
