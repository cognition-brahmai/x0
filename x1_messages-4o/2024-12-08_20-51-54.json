To ensure that only the most deserving candidates are selected, you must go beyond surface-level thinking and show your ability to perform multiple-step reasoning. Here are three puzzles to test your skills:\n1. Calculate the minimum grade point average a student must achieve in their next four courses, given they currently have a 3.5 GPA and have taken six courses, in order to maintain an overall average of 3.5. This requires the ability to analyze and calculate complex academic performance metrics.\n2. Determine the maximum number of hours a student can spend on academic pursuits per week while still meeting the requirement of not exceeding a total of 70 hours per week on academic pursuits and extracurriculars combined. This involves understanding the constraints and optimizing the allocation of time.\n3. Given that two students have different completion times for a task in a research project, calculate the time it will take for them to finish the project working together. This requires coordination and collaboration skills, as well as the ability to estimate time to completion based on individual task completion times. Can you identify the candidates who possess the necessary skills to solve these puzzles and thus, are most likely to succeed in the program?"

        "content": "Let's tackle each of these puzzles step by step:\n\n### Puzzle 1: Minimum GPA Calculation\n\nThe student wants to maintain an overall GPA of 3.5 after taking ten courses. Currently, they have a GPA of 3.5 over six courses. We need to find the minimum GPA they must achieve in the next four courses.\n\n1. **Current Total Grade Points:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Grade Points} = \\text{Current GPA} \\times \\text{Number of Courses} = 3.5 \\times 6 = 21\n   \\]\n\n2. **Total Grade Points Required for 10 Courses:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Required Grade Points} = \\text{Desired GPA} \\times \\text{Total Courses} = 3.5 \\times 10 = 35\n   \\]\n\n3. **Grade Points Needed from Next Four Courses:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Grade Points Needed} = \\text{Total Required Grade Points} - \\text{Current Total Grade Points} = 35 - 21 = 14\n   \\]\n\n4. **Minimum GPA Required for Next Four Courses:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Minimum GPA} = \\frac{\\text{Grade Points Needed}}{\\text{Number of Courses}} = \\frac{14}{4} = 3.5\n   \\]\n\nThus, the student must achieve a minimum GPA of 3.5 in their next four courses to maintain an overall GPA of 3.5.\n\n### Puzzle 2: Maximum Hours for Academic Pursuits\n\nThe student has a total of 70 hours per week for both academic pursuits and extracurriculars. We need to determine the maximum number of hours that can be spent on academics.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( A \\) be the number of hours spent on academics.\n   - Let \\( E \\) be the number of hours spent on extracurriculars.\n\n2. **Constraint:**\n   \\[\n   A + E \\leq 70\n   \\]\n\n3. **Maximize Academic Hours:**\n   To maximize \\( A \\), minimize \\( E \\). Assuming the student spends the least possible time (which could be zero) on extracurriculars:\n   \\[\n   E = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad A = 70\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of hours a student can spend on academic pursuits per week is 70 hours, provided they spend no time on extracurriculars.\n\n### Puzzle 3: Task Completion Time for Two Students\n\nTwo students work together on a task, each with different individual completion times. Let's denote:\n\n- Student 1's time to complete the task alone as \\( T_1 \\).\n- Student 2's time to complete the task alone as \\( T_2 \\).\n\nThe formula to calculate the combined time \\( T \\) for two workers is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{T} = \\frac{1}{T_1} + \\frac{1}{T_2}\n\\]\n\nSuppose \\( T_1 = a \\) hours and \\( T_2 = b \\) hours. Then:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{T} = \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{b + a}{ab}\n\\]\n\\[\nT = \\frac{ab}{a + b}\n\\]\n\nThis formula will give the time it takes for both students to finish the task when working together.\n\nBy solving these puzzles, we can assess a candidate's ability to perform multi-step reasoning and handle complex problem-solving scenarios, which are crucial for success in the program."
