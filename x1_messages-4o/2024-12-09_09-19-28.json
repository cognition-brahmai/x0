        "content": "Certainly! To write an SQL query to retrieve the names of customers who have bought a specific item, you'll first need to know the structure of your database tables. Typically, you might have a `Customers` table, an `Orders` table, and an `OrderDetails` table. Here's a basic example of how you might structure the query:\n\nLet's assume the following:\n\n- `Customers` table with columns: `CustomerID`, `CustomerName`\n- `Orders` table with columns: `OrderID`, `CustomerID`\n- `OrderDetails` table with columns: `OrderDetailID`, `OrderID`, `ItemID`\n- `Items` table with columns: `ItemID`, `ItemName`\n\nTo find customers who have bought a specific item, you can use a query like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT C.CustomerName\nFROM Customers C\nJOIN Orders O ON C.CustomerID = O.CustomerID\nJOIN OrderDetails OD ON O.OrderID = OD.OrderID\nJOIN Items I ON OD.ItemID = I.ItemID\nWHERE I.ItemName = 'Specific Item Name';\n```\n\nReplace `'Specific Item Name'` with the name of the item you're interested in. This query joins the necessary tables and filters the results to only include customers who have ordered the specified item. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to ensure that each customer's name appears only once in the result set, even if they have purchased the item multiple times."
