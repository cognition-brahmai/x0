        "content": "Let's calculate the trading volume for each day based on the clues provided and then find the average for the week:\n\n1. **Monday**: 20,000 contracts.\n2. **Tuesday**: Double Monday, so 2 * 20,000 = 40,000 contracts.\n3. **Wednesday**: Half of Tuesday, so 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 contracts.\n4. **Thursday**: Three times Wednesday, so 3 * 20,000 = 60,000 contracts.\n5. **Friday**: 10,000 more than Thursday, so 60,000 + 10,000 = 70,000 contracts.\n\nNow, let's calculate the average trading volume for the week:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average} = \\frac{\\text{Total Volume}}{\\text{Number of Days}} = \\frac{20,000 + 40,000 + 20,000 + 60,000 + 70,000}{5} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Average} = \\frac{210,000}{5} = 42,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the predicted daily average trading volume of Gold futures contracts for the upcoming week is 42,000 contracts."
