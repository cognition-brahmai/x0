I have implemented the following code, expecting it to return `{u'bird': 2, u'cat': 3, u'dog': 2, u'fish': 2}`, but it is not giving the expected output.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n\ntexts=[\"dog cat fish\",\"dog cat cat\",\"fish bird\",\"bird\"]\ncv = CountVectorizer()\ncv_fit=cv.fit_transform(texts)\n\nprint cv.vocabulary_\n{u'bird': 0, u'cat': 1, u'dog': 2, u'fish': 3}\n```"

        "content": "The `CountVectorizer` in Scikit-learn is a great tool for converting a collection of text documents into a matrix of token counts. However, the `vocabulary_` attribute provides a mapping of terms to feature indices, not their frequencies. To get the word frequency in the corpus, you should sum the term-document matrix along the appropriate axis.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to compute the word frequency:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n\ntexts = [\"dog cat fish\", \"dog cat cat\", \"fish bird\", \"bird\"]\ncv = CountVectorizer()\ncv_fit = cv.fit_transform(texts)\n\n# Sum the term frequencies across all documents\nword_counts = np.asarray(cv_fit.sum(axis=0)).flatten()\n\n# Map the words to their frequency\nword_freq = dict(zip(cv.get_feature_names_out(), word_counts))\n\nprint(word_freq)\n```\n\nThis code will output the word frequencies in the corpus as expected:\n\n```\n{'bird': 2, 'cat': 3, 'dog': 2, 'fish': 2}\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what happens:\n\n1. `cv.fit_transform(texts)` creates a sparse matrix where each row represents a document, and each column represents a word from the vocabulary.\n2. `cv_fit.sum(axis=0)` sums the occurrences of each word across all documents.\n3. `np.asarray(...).flatten()` converts the resulting matrix to a 1D array of word counts.\n4. `cv.get_feature_names_out()` returns the list of words in the same order as the columns of the matrix, allowing you to zip them with their corresponding counts to create a dictionary of word frequencies."
