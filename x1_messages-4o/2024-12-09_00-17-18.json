For instance, I have a string like this: \"Hello,\\\\nworld!\" and I want to un-escape it to get: \"Hello, \\nworld!\". But I hesitate to use eval() as it might pose a security risk when dealing with untrusted strings. Is there an alternative function in the standard library that can achieve this?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can un-escape a backslash-escaped string in Python safely using the `unicode_escape` codec. This approach avoids the security risks associated with using `eval()`.\n\nHere is how you can do it:\n\n```python\nescaped_string = \"Hello,\\\\nworld!\"\nunescaped_string = bytes(escaped_string, \"utf-8\").decode(\"unicode_escape\")\nprint(unescaped_string)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nHello,\nworld!\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, `bytes(escaped_string, \"utf-8\")` converts the string into a bytes object, and `decode(\"unicode_escape\")` decodes it using the `unicode_escape` codec, which interprets the escape sequences properly. This method is safe and effective for unescaping strings without executing any code, unlike `eval()`."
