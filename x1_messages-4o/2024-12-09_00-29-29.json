This method writes directly to the standard output in Ruby. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```ruby\nSTDOUT.write(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\n\nThis will output \"Hello, World!\" to the console. Just like in Python, this method does not automatically append a newline character at the end, so if you want a new line, you'll need to include `\\n` manually."
