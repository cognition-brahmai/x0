The model is implemented as a class that inherits from Model. However, when the `self.build` method is reached, I encounter an error. How can I resolve this issue? The code for my model is as follows:\n\n```python\nclass MyModel(tf.keras.models.Model):\n\n    def __init__(self, size, input_shape):\n        super(MyModel, self).__init__()\n        self.layer = My_Layer()\n        self.build(input_shape)\n\n    def call(self, inputs):\n        return self.layer(inputs)\n```\n\nThe error message I receive is:\n\n```python\nValueError: You cannot build your model by calling `build` if your layers do not support float type inputs. Instead, in order to instantiate and build your model, `call` your model on real tensor data (of the correct dtype).\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is because the `build` method in Keras is designed to initialize the weights of the layer using an input tensor of a specified shape. The default assumption is that this tensor is of a float type (usually `float32`). However, your custom layer requires `int32` inputs, which is causing the conflict when you call `build`.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can avoid explicitly calling `self.build(input_shape)` in the `__init__` method. Instead, the model's build process should occur when you first call the model with actual input data. This allows Keras to correctly infer the input types and shapes from the actual data you provide.\n\nHere's how you can modify your model class:\n\n```python\nclass MyModel(tf.keras.models.Model):\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(MyModel, self).__init__()\n        self.layer = My_Layer()\n\n    def call(self, inputs):\n        return self.layer(inputs)\n```\n\nNow, when you create an instance of `MyModel`, you don't need to specify `input_shape`:\n\n```python\nmodel = MyModel()\n```\n\nAnd when you first use the model with input data, Keras will automatically build the model using the correct input data types:\n\n```python\n# Example input data\ninput_data = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], dtype=tf.int32)  # Ensure the dtype is int32\noutput = model(input_data)\n```\n\nBy doing this, you defer the model building until you have actual data, allowing Keras to handle input types correctly."
