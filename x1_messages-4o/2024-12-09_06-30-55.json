I understand that I can use `os.system` to run the shell command, but I'm looking for a cleaner, Python-specific interface to the `mount` system call. I was expecting something like `os.mount()`, but I can't seem to find it."

        "content": "Mounting a filesystem programmatically in Python doesn't have a direct, built-in function like `os.mount()`, as Python's standard library doesn't provide a specific interface for the `mount` system call. However, there are a few approaches you can take to achieve this:\n\n1. **Using `subprocess` module**: While you mentioned you want to avoid `os.system`, using the `subprocess` module is a more robust and flexible way to execute shell commands in Python. It allows you to run the `mount` command with more control over input/output and error handling.\n\n   Here's an example of how you might use `subprocess`:\n\n   ```python\n   import subprocess\n\n   def mount_filesystem(source, target, fs_type, options=None):\n       command = ['mount', '-t', fs_type]\n       if options:\n           command.extend(['-o', options])\n       command.extend([source, target])\n       \n       try:\n           subprocess.run(command, check=True)\n           print(f\"Mounted {source} to {target} successfully.\")\n       except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:\n           print(f\"Error mounting filesystem: {e}\")\n\n   # Example usage\n   source = '/dev/sdX1'\n   target = '/mnt/my_mount_point'\n   fs_type = 'ext4'\n   options = 'defaults'\n   \n   mount_filesystem(source, target, fs_type, options)\n   ```\n\n2. **Using third-party libraries**: There are a few libraries that offer a more Pythonic interface to system operations, including mounting filesystems. One such library is `pyfilesystem2`, although it doesn't directly support mounting filesystems, it provides an abstraction for interacting with various filesystems.\n\n3. **Direct system calls with ctypes or cffi**: If you're looking for a more low-level and direct approach, you can use `ctypes` or `cffi` to make system calls directly from Python to the underlying operating system. This method requires a good understanding of the C library's `mount` function and its parameters.\n\n   Here's a very basic example using `ctypes` (Linux-specific):\n\n   ```python\n   import ctypes\n   import os\n\n   libc = ctypes.CDLL(\"libc.so.6\")\n\n   def mount(source, target, fs_type, options):\n       if not os.path.exists(target):\n           os.makedirs(target)\n       ret = libc.mount(\n           ctypes.c_char_p(source.encode('utf-8')),\n           ctypes.c_char_p(target.encode('utf-8')),\n           ctypes.c_char_p(fs_type.encode('utf-8')),\n           ctypes.c_ulong(0),  # flags\n           ctypes.c_char_p(options.encode('utf-8')) if options else None\n       )\n       if ret != 0:\n           err = ctypes.get_errno()\n           raise OSError(err, os.strerror(err))\n       print(f\"Mounted {source} to {target} successfully.\")\n\n   # Example usage\n   source = '/dev/sdX1'\n   target = '/mnt/my_mount_point'\n   fs_type = 'ext4'\n   options = 'defaults'\n   \n   mount(source, target, fs_type, options)\n   ```\n\n   Note: Directly using `ctypes` to call system functions should be done with caution, as it can lead to system instability if not done correctly.\n\nEach method has its own trade-offs in terms of complexity, portability, and safety. Choose the one that best fits your needs and environment."
