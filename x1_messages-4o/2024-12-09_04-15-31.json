I am trying to build a dictionary A from dictionary B, where if a certain key doesn't exist in B, I need to do nothing and continue on. I have two possible implementations for this case and I am unsure as to which one is more readable and efficient. The first implementation uses a try/except block:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    A[\"blah\"] = B[\"blah\"]\nexcept KeyError:\n    pass\n```\n\nThe second implementation uses an if condition:\n\n```python\nif \"blah\" in B:\n    A[\"blah\"] = B[\"blah\"]\n```\n\nConsidering Python's philosophy of \"do and ask for forgiveness\" vs \"simplicity and explicitness\", could you please advise on which approach is better and why?"

        "content": "In Python, both the \"EAFP\" (Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission) and the \"LBYL\" (Look Before You Leap) idioms are commonly used, and each has its own advantages depending on the context.\n\n1. **EAFP (try/except block)**:\n   ```python\n   try:\n       A[\"blah\"] = B[\"blah\"]\n   except KeyError:\n       pass\n   ```\n   - **Pros**: This approach is concise and directly attempts the operation, handling exceptions as they occur. It's often preferred in scenarios where exceptions are truly exceptional and not expected to happen frequently.\n   - **Cons**: It may slightly impact performance if exceptions are common because handling exceptions is generally more expensive than checking conditions.\n\n2. **LBYL (if condition)**:\n   ```python\n   if \"blah\" in B:\n       A[\"blah\"] = B[\"blah\"]\n   ```\n   - **Pros**: This approach is explicit and clear, making it easy to understand for someone reading the code. It avoids the overhead of handling exceptions by checking conditions beforehand.\n   - **Cons**: It might be slightly less efficient if the lookup operation is expensive and the key is often present, as it checks the condition before doing the assignment.\n\n**Recommendation**:\nGiven the context you've described, using the `if` condition (LBYL) is typically more readable and explicit, which aligns well with Python's philosophy of simplicity and clarity. It's also generally more efficient in cases where missing keys are not exceptional and happen often. This approach makes it clear that you're only interested in the operation if the key is present, and it avoids the potential overhead of catching exceptions.\n\nTherefore, I'd recommend using the LBYL approach unless there's a compelling reason to handle many potential exceptions or if the code is part of a critical performance path where exception handling is beneficial."
