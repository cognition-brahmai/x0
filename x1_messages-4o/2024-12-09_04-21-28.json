I tried to implement this by generating a set of all powers of two, up to a certain limit, and then checking if the given number exists in the set. However, I encounter problems when testing for certain inputs. My code is displayed below:\n\n```python\na, i = set(), 1\nwhile i <= 10000:\n    a.add(i)\n    i <<= 1\n\nN = int(input())\nif N in a:\n    print(\"True\")\nelse:\n    print(\"False\")\n```\n\nMy initial plan was to verify if each input is a power of 2 by starting from 1 and multiplying by 2 until the product exceeds the input number. Instead, I decided to store all powers of 2 in a set beforehand, hoping to achieve a time complexity of O(1) for the checking operation. However, it seems to be not working for some inputs. How can I improve this?"

        "content": "Your approach of precomputing the powers of two and storing them in a set is sound for checking membership in constant time. However, there might be a couple of reasons why the code is not working as expected for certain inputs:\n\n1. **Range Limit**: You are generating powers of two only up to 10,000. If you input a number greater than 10,000, the check will fail even if it is a power of two. You should consider extending the range or using a different approach if you want to handle larger numbers.\n\n2. **Input Handling**: Ensure that the input number is a positive integer. Powers of two are positive, so if a negative number or zero is input, it will always return \"False\".\n\nHere's how you can improve your code:\n\n- **Extend the Range**: If you want to handle numbers up to a higher limit, consider increasing the value in your loop condition.\n- **Alternative Approach**: Instead of using a set, you can directly check if a number is a power of two using bitwise operations. This approach is more efficient and doesn't require precomputation:\n\n```python\ndef is_power_of_two(n):\n    # A power of two has exactly one bit set in its binary representation\n    return n > 0 and (n & (n - 1)) == 0\n\nN = int(input())\nif is_power_of_two(N):\n    print(\"True\")\nelse:\n    print(\"False\")\n```\n\nThis function `is_power_of_two` leverages the property that powers of two have exactly one bit set in their binary representation. The expression `(n & (n - 1)) == 0` checks if `n` is a power of two in constant time. This approach is both efficient and eliminates the need for a precomputed set."
