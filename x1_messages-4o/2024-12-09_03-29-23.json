The database contains the sentences to be replaced and their replacements. However, I've run into a problem where I need the script to find and replace only whole words, not parts of words. This is causing issues with words like 'Result' and 'Event'. When I replace these words with 'Resultado' and 'Evento' respectively, running the script a second time replaces them again, giving me 'Resultadoado' and 'Eventoo'. How can I modify my script to only replace whole words, and not parts of words?"

        "content": "To modify your script to replace only whole words and avoid partial replacements, you can use regular expressions. Regular expressions can match whole words by using word boundaries. In most programming languages, the `\\b` metacharacter is used to signify a word boundary.\n\nHere's a general approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Use Regular Expressions:** Ensure your script uses a regex pattern to identify whole words.\n2. **Word Boundary `\\b`:** Add `\\b` before and after the word you want to replace. This will ensure that only whole words are matched.\n\nHere's an example in Python using the `re` module, which is commonly used for regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Example text\ntext = \"This is a Result and Event that should be Resulted and Evented.\"\n\n# Dictionary of words to replace\nreplacements = {\n    \"Result\": \"Resultado\",\n    \"Event\": \"Evento\"\n}\n\n# Function to replace whole words using regex\ndef replace_whole_words(text, replacements):\n    for word, replacement in replacements.items():\n        # Use \\b to denote word boundaries\n        pattern = r'\\b' + re.escape(word) + r'\\b'\n        text = re.sub(pattern, replacement, text)\n    return text\n\n# Applying the function\nnew_text = replace_whole_words(text, replacements)\nprint(new_text)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`re.escape(word)`:** This ensures that any special characters in the words are treated as literal strings.\n- **`\\b`:** Placed before and after the word to ensure that only whole words are matched.\n\nBy doing this, your script will replace only the whole words, avoiding the issue of double replacements like 'Resultadoado'. Adjust the logic to fit the specifics of your script and programming language."
