Here is a basic example of how you might construct such a query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT SUM(column_name) AS total_sum\nFROM table_name;\n```\n\nReplace `column_name` with the name of the column you want to sum, and `table_name` with the name of your table. The result will give you the total sum of all values in the specified column. The `AS total_sum` part is optional and is used to give a name to the output column in the result set."
