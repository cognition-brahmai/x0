The new text is returned by the formula and can be displayed in another cell."

        "content": "You're on the right track with using the `SUBSTITUTE` function in Excel to replace specific text within a cell. The `SUBSTITUTE` function is quite straightforward and works well for this purpose. You've correctly identified the syntax:\n\n```excel\n=SUBSTITUTE(text, old_text, new_text, [instance_num])\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `text` is the cell reference or actual text you want to modify.\n- `old_text` is the text you want to replace.\n- `new_text` is the text you want to replace it with.\n- `[instance_num]` is optional and specifies which occurrence of `old_text` to replace if it appears multiple times. If omitted, all occurrences are replaced.\n\nIn your example, to replace the word \"awful\" with \"disgusting\" in cell A1, you'd use:\n\n```excel\n=SUBSTITUTE(A1, \"awful\", \"disgusting\")\n```\n\nHere's how you can implement it:\n\n1. Select the cell where you want the result to appear.\n2. Enter the formula above, making sure to reference the correct cell containing the word you want to replace (in this case, A1).\n3. Press Enter, and the formula will output the modified text with \"awful\" replaced by \"disgusting\".\n\nThis formula will replace all instances of the word \"awful\" in A1 with \"disgusting\". If your text contains multiple occurrences and you only want to replace a specific one, you can use the optional `[instance_num]` parameter. For example, to replace only the second occurrence of \"awful\", you would use:\n\n```excel\n=SUBSTITUTE(A1, \"awful\", \"disgusting\", 2)\n```\n\nThis is particularly useful if the cell contains multiple instances of the word and you only want to change one specific instance."
