        "content": "In Keras, I'm having trouble understanding the definition of mean squared error (MSE). The definition is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred):\n    return K.mean(K.square(y_pred - y_true), axis=-1)\n```\n\nI was expecting the mean to be taken across the batches (which would be `axis=0`), but instead, it's taken at `axis=-1`. I've been playing around with it and it seems to me that `K.mean` behaves differently than `numpy.mean`. Could someone clarify this for me? \n\nI'm also wondering if it's possible to look inside the cost function at runtime. From what I understand, the function is called at compile time which prevents me from evaluating concrete values. \n\nFor example, imagine doing regression and having a single output neuron and training with a batch size of ten. Using numpy, I get this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\na = np.ones((10, 1))\na\n# Returns:\narray([[ 1.],\n       [ 1.],\n       [ 1.],\n       [ 1.],\n       [ 1.],\n       [ 1.],\n       [ 1.],\n       [ 1.],\n       [ 1.],\n       [ 1.]])\nnp.mean(a, axis=-1)\n# Returns:\narray([ 1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.])\n```\n\nThis seems to simply flatten the array instead of taking the mean of all the predictions."

        "content": "The confusion you're experiencing is quite common when working with Keras and its backend (often TensorFlow). Let's break it down:\n\n### Understanding the Axis in Mean Squared Error\n\n1. **Mean Squared Error in Keras**: \n   The function `mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred)` defined in Keras uses `K.mean(K.square(y_pred - y_true), axis=-1)`. Here, `axis=-1` refers to the last axis of the tensor. In the context of MSE, `K.square(y_pred - y_true)` computes the squared differences for each element in the last dimension, and `K.mean(..., axis=-1)` computes the mean across this last dimension.\n\n2. **Why Axis -1?**:\n   - In a typical regression problem with a single output (like your example with a single output neuron), the last axis corresponds to the output value(s) for each sample.\n   - By specifying `axis=-1`, Keras is computing the mean squared error for each sample in the batch individually, and not across the batch. This is useful in cases where you might have multiple outputs per sample (e.g., multi-output regression).\n\n3. **Difference with NumPy**:\n   - `np.mean(a, axis=-1)` computes the mean along the last axis for each sub-array. If your array `a` is of shape `(10, 1)`, it computes the mean for each of the sub-arrays `[1.]`, which is why you see the result `array([1., 1., ..., 1.])`.\n\n### Looking Inside the Cost Function\n\nKeras does not directly expose the internal computations of the loss functions during runtime, as these are typically symbolic computations performed by the backend (TensorFlow or Theano). However, you can inspect the values during training using callbacks or by modifying the model, for example:\n\n1. **Using Callbacks**:\n   - You can create a custom callback to print the loss values after each batch or epoch. This way, you can see how the loss changes over time.\n\n2. **TensorFlow Debugging**:\n   - If you are using TensorFlow as the backend, you can use TensorFlow's debugging capabilities, such as `tf.print` or `tf.summary`, within a custom loss function to observe intermediate values.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Model**:\n   - After training, you can evaluate your model on a test set using `model.evaluate`, which will calculate and print the loss value (among other metrics) for the provided test data.\n\n4. **Custom Training Loop**:\n   - For ultimate control, you could write a custom training loop using `tf.GradientTape` which would allow you to compute and inspect the loss at each training step.\n\nBy understanding these concepts, you can better navigate the intricacies of working with Keras and TensorFlow, and gain more insight into how your models are training."
