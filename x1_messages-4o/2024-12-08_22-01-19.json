        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this by using the `re` module in Python, which provides support for regular expressions. Here's how you can replace all occurrences of the word \"explosion\" with another word, say \"blast,\" in a text file:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Function to replace occurrences of a word in a text file\ndef replace_word_in_file(file_path, target_word, replacement_word):\n    # Open the file in read mode\n    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n        file_content = file.read()\n    \n    # Use regular expression to replace all occurrences of the target word\n    updated_content = re.sub(rf'\\b{target_word}\\b', replacement_word, file_content)\n    \n    # Open the file in write mode and save the updated content\n    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:\n        file.write(updated_content)\n\n# Specify the path to your text file\nfile_path = 'path/to/your/textfile.txt'\n\n# Call the function to replace \"explosion\" with \"blast\"\nreplace_word_in_file(file_path, 'explosion', 'blast')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Import re module:** This is necessary for using regular expressions in Python.\n- **Function Definition:** The function `replace_word_in_file` takes three parameters: `file_path`, `target_word`, and `replacement_word`.\n- **Reading File:** The file is opened in read mode, and its content is read into `file_content`.\n- **Regular Expression Substitution:** The `re.sub` function is used to replace all occurrences of the word \"explosion\" with \"blast\". The `\\b` ensures that only whole words are matched.\n- **Writing Updated Content:** The file is opened in write mode, and the updated content is written back to the file.\n\nMake sure to replace `'path/to/your/textfile.txt'` with the actual path to your text file."
