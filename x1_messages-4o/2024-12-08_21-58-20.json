Specifically, I would like to know the height differences between Flynn Rider, Maximus the horse, and Rapunzel. Can you arrange their heights from shortest to tallest, with the corresponding numerical values? Please take note that Flynn is shorter than Maximus, but taller than Rapunzel, while Maximus is taller than both Flynn and Rapunzel. It would also be helpful to have this information in a markdown format for easy analysis. Thank you."
