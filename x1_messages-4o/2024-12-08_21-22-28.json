        "content": "To ensure that your HTML page is responsive and can be viewed on different devices, you can follow these steps and incorporate the necessary features:\n\n1. **Responsive Design**:\n   - Use CSS Media Queries to adjust the layout based on the screen size.\n   - Utilize a responsive CSS framework like Bootstrap or Foundation which provides pre-built classes for responsiveness.\n   - Use flexible grid layouts and percentage-based widths.\n   - Set images to be responsive using `max-width: 100%; height: auto;`.\n\n2. **Including Dietary Information and Serving Sizes**:\n   - Add a section for each menu item detailing dietary information (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free) using icons or text.\n   - Include a dropdown or radio buttons for guests to select preferred serving sizes (e.g., small, medium, large).\n\n3. **Real-Time Availability Updates**:\n   - Use JavaScript (AJAX) to fetch real-time availability data from a server.\n   - Create an endpoint on your server that returns the current availability status of each menu item.\n   - Use JavaScript to update the availability status dynamically on the page without needing a refresh.\n\n4. **Shell Command to Email the Menu**:\n   - You can use a combination of Shell scripting and a mail service like `sendmail` or `mail` to automate emailing the menu. Here's a basic example using `sendmail`:\n\n```shell\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Define the email subject and recipient list\nSUBJECT=\"Dinner Menu\"\nEMAIL_LIST=(\"guest1@example.com\" \"guest2@example.com\") # Add more emails as needed\n\n# Path to the menu file (HTML or plain text)\nMENU_FILE=\"/path/to/menu.html\"\n\n# Loop through the email list and send the menu\nfor EMAIL in \"${EMAIL_LIST[@]}\"\ndo\n  (\n    echo \"To: $EMAIL\"\n    echo \"Subject: $SUBJECT\"\n    echo \"Content-Type: text/html\"\n    echo\n    cat \"$MENU_FILE\"\n  ) | sendmail -t\ndone\n```\n\nMake sure your server has `sendmail` configured properly. You can replace `sendmail` with other mail services if needed, like `mail` or `mutt`.\n\nBy implementing these steps, you can create a responsive HTML page that includes dietary information, allows for serving size selection, provides real-time updates, and automatically emails the menu to guests."
