I have a class called `resource_cl` and I want each object created from it to have a unique, auto-incrementing ID. Here is my existing class code:\n\n```python\nclass resource_cl :\n    def __init__(self, Name, Position, Type, Active):\n        self.Name = Name\n        self.Position = Position\n        self.Type = Type\n        self.Active = Active\n```\n\nAnd here is how I am creating new instances of the class:\n\n```python\nresources = []\nresources.append(resource_cl('Sam Sneed', 'Programmer', 'full time', True))\n```\n\nI'm aware that I can reference `resource_cl`, but I'm not sure how to proceed with the auto-incrementing IDs."

        "content": "To create an incremental ID for each instance of a class in Python, you can use a class variable to keep track of the ID counter. Each time a new instance is created, you increment this counter and assign the new ID to the instance. Here's how you can modify your `resource_cl` class to achieve this:\n\n```python\nclass Resource:\n    # Class variable to keep track of the next available ID\n    _id_counter = 1\n\n    def __init__(self, Name, Position, Type, Active):\n        self.Name = Name\n        self.Position = Position\n        self.Type = Type\n        self.Active = Active\n        \n        # Assign the current ID to the instance and increment the counter\n        self.ID = Resource._id_counter\n        Resource._id_counter += 1\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"Resource(ID={self.ID}, Name={self.Name}, Position={self.Position}, Type={self.Type}, Active={self.Active})\"\n\n# Example usage\nresources = []\nresources.append(Resource('Sam Sneed', 'Programmer', 'full time', True))\nresources.append(Resource('Jane Doe', 'Designer', 'part time', False))\n\n# Display the resources\nfor resource in resources:\n    print(resource)\n```\n\nHere's what's happening in the code:\n\n1. A class variable `_id_counter` is defined to keep track of the next available ID. It is initialized to 1.\n2. In the `__init__` method, each time a new `Resource` object is created, it assigns the current value of `_id_counter` to `self.ID`.\n3. The `_id_counter` is then incremented to ensure the next instance gets a unique ID.\n4. The `__repr__` method is overridden to provide a string representation of the `Resource` object, which is useful for debugging and viewing the object details.\n\nThis setup ensures that each `Resource` instance has a unique, auto-incrementing ID."
