Here's your XML format with a slight refinement for clarity:\n\n```xml\n<classroom>\n  <state>Noisy</state>\n  <occupants>\n    <children>Present</children>\n  </occupants>\n</classroom>\n```\n\nIn this XML structure:\n- `<state>` is used to describe the condition of the classroom.\n- `<occupants>` outlines who is in the classroom, with `<children>` indicating their presence. \n\nThis approach efficiently conveys the information in a structured manner."
