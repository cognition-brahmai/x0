The error I'm getting is \"TypeError: can't pickle _thread.lock objects\". The model can be trained and can be used to predict, but the issue only appears when trying to save. If I remove the lambda layer or the external variables it works. I need these variables to be outside the scope of the preprocess function because I use those same variables in a postprocess function. I would like to be able to reuse 'maximum', 'minimum', and 'span' in another Lambda layer, which is why they are defined outside the scope of 'preprocess'. I also need to create my model in a function because I am optimizing hyperparameters and so I iterate over different models with different set of parameters. How can I solve this issue?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to how Python handles the serialization (pickling) of certain objects when saving models. Keras, by default, uses the HDF5 format for saving models, which relies on the pickle module. The `_thread.lock` objects, which are often present when using multithreading or certain types of shared variables, cannot be pickled.\n\nHere's how you can address this issue:\n\n1. **Use Custom Objects**: If your Lambda layer is using external variables or functions, consider implementing a custom layer instead. This can be done by subclassing `tf.keras.layers.Layer` and implementing the `call` method. This allows you to manage variables internally and avoid the serialization issue with Lambda layers.\n\n2. **Save Weights and Architecture Separately**: Instead of using `model.save()`, you can save the model architecture and weights separately. The model's architecture can be saved as JSON or YAML, and then you can save the weights using `model.save_weights()`. Here's an example:\n\n    ```python\n    # Save the model architecture\n    model_json = model.to_json()\n    with open(\"model.json\", \"w\") as json_file:\n        json_file.write(model_json)\n\n    # Save the model weights\n    model.save_weights(\"model_weights.h5\")\n    ```\n\n    To load the model later, you can do:\n\n    ```python\n    from tensorflow.keras.models import model_from_json\n\n    # Load the model architecture\n    with open(\"model.json\", \"r\") as json_file:\n        model_json = json_file.read()\n\n    model = model_from_json(model_json)\n\n    # Load the weights\n    model.load_weights(\"model_weights.h5\")\n    ```\n\n3. **Use a Custom Saving Function**: If you need to save additional state or variables, consider using a custom saving function that writes these variables to a separate file (e.g., using `pickle` or `joblib` for variables that can be serialized).\n\n4. **Switch to `tf.saved_model` Format**: If you're using TensorFlow 2.x, you can switch to using the TensorFlow SavedModel format, which is more robust and flexible than the HDF5 format. It can handle custom layers and functions more gracefully:\n\n    ```python\n    model.save(\"path_to_saved_model\", save_format='tf')\n    ```\n\n    To load the model:\n\n    ```python\n    model = tf.keras.models.load_model(\"path_to_saved_model\")\n    ```\n\n5. **Avoid Using Threads Directly**: If possible, refactor your code to avoid using objects that cannot be pickled, such as `_thread.lock`. This might involve redesigning parts of your code to use other synchronization mechanisms that are compatible with serialization.\n\nBy refactoring your Lambda layers into custom layers or using the TensorFlow SavedModel format, you should be able to avoid the pickling issue and save your model successfully."
