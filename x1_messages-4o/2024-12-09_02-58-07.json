You can compile CUDA programs on any system that has the CUDA Toolkit installed, regardless of whether it has a CUDA-capable GPU. The `nvcc` compiler translates the CUDA code into a binary that can be executed on a CUDA-capable GPU.\n\nHowever, to actually run the compiled CUDA program, you will need a system with a CUDA-capable GPU and the appropriate NVIDIA drivers installed. This means you can compile your CUDA programs on a machine without a CUDA-capable GPU and then transfer the compiled binaries to a machine with the necessary hardware to execute them."
