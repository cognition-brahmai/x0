Here is the database schema:\nTable name: countries\nColumns: id, name, capital\nFirst, what is the result of 45 multiplied by 3? Please enter the answer in the format XX.\nOnce you have answered the math problem, you will be prompted to provide the name of the country whose capital you want to retrieve. \nThen, you will be asked to choose a number between 1 and 5. \nBased on your number selection, the script will retrieve the capital of the country you provided and perform a series of logical operations on it. \nOnly after completing all these steps will you receive the capital of the country you requested. \nHere is a sample code structure to get you started:\nimport Foundation\n// math problem\nlet answer = \"135\"\nprint(\"What is the result of 45 multiplied by 3?\")\nguard let userInput = readLine() else {\n    fatalError(\"Failed to read user input\")\n}\nif userInput != answer {\n  print(\"Incorrect answer.

Here's a Swift code that follows the structure you provided and includes the logic to retrieve the capital of a country from a database, given a series of prompts:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\n// Assuming SQLiteDatabase is a class that handles SQLite operations\nclass SQLiteDatabase {\n    // Mock implementation of executeQuery method\n    func executeQuery(query: String) -> [[String: Any]]? {\n        // Here, you should implement the actual database query execution\n        // Returning a mock result for demonstration purposes\n        if query.contains(\"India\") {\n            return [[\"capital\": \"New Delhi\"]]\n        }\n        return nil\n    }\n}\n\n// Math problem\nlet answer = \"135\"\nprint(\"What is the result of 45 multiplied by 3?\")\nguard let userInput = readLine() else {\n    fatalError(\"Failed to read user input\")\n}\n\nif userInput != answer {\n    print(\"Incorrect answer.

This choice affects how the capital's name is displayed.\n\n4. **Database Query**: The script queries the database to retrieve the capital of the specified country.\n\n5. **Logical Operations**: Depending on the user's number choice, the script modifies the capital's name:\n   - If the number is even, the capital name is displayed in uppercase.\n   - If the number is odd, the capital name is displayed in lowercase.\n   - If the number is greater than 3, spaces in the capital name are replaced with hyphens.\n\n6. **Final Output**: The script displays the modified capital name based on the user's inputs and choices. \n\nPlease replace the mock `SQLiteDatabase` class with your actual database handling logic to execute the query and fetch results."
