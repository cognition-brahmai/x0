        "content": "How can I read a long multiline string line by line in Python? I have a string with many lines and I want to read each line individually using a `for` clause. However, when I try to execute the following code, I encounter an error on the `textData` variable, which is used in the `for line in textData` line: \n\n```python\nfor line in textData\n    print line\n    lineResult = libLAPFF.parseLine(line)\n```\n\nThe `textData` variable does exist as I print it before executing the loop, but it seems as though the pre-compiler is raising an error. How can I fix this?"

        "content": "To read a long multiline string line by line in Python, you can use the `splitlines()` method on the string. This method splits the string at line boundaries and returns a list of lines. You can then iterate over this list using a `for` loop. \n\nAdditionally, it looks like your `for` loop is missing a colon (`:`) at the end, which is necessary in Python syntax. Here's how you can fix your code to read each line individually:\n\n```python\ntextData = \"\"\"Your\nmultiline\nstring\ngoes\nhere\"\"\"\n\n# Use splitlines() to iterate over each line\nfor line in textData.splitlines():\n    print(line)\n    lineResult = libLAPFF.parseLine(line)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening:\n- `textData.splitlines()` takes your multiline string and splits it into a list of lines.\n- The `for` loop iterates over each line in this list.\n- The colon (`:`) at the end of the `for` statement is crucial for Python's syntax to denote the start of the loop block.\n- The `print(line)` statement will print each line, and `lineResult = libLAPFF.parseLine(line)` will process each line with the `parseLine` function from `libLAPFF`. \n\nMake sure that the rest of your code and any library imports are correct, and this should fix the issue you're encountering."
