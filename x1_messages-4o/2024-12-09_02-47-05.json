I have a DataFrame column with numeric values as follows: \n```python \ndf['percentage'].head()\n46.5\n44.2\n100.0\n42.12\n```\nI want to bin these values into bins specified by this list:\n```python \nbins = [0, 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100]\n```\nHow can I return the result as bins with their corresponding value counts?"

        "content": "To bin a numeric column in a pandas DataFrame and get the count of values within each bin, you can use the `pd.cut()` function, which is specifically designed for this purpose. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {'percentage': [46.5, 44.2, 100.0, 42.12]}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Define the bins\nbins = [0, 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100]\n\n# Use pd.cut to bin the data\ndf['binned'] = pd.cut(df['percentage'], bins=bins)\n\n# Get the counts for each bin\nbin_counts = df['binned'].value_counts().sort_index()\n\nprint(bin_counts)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`pd.cut()`**: This function is used to segment and sort the values into discrete intervals (bins). You provide it the data you want to bin, and the list of bins.\n- **`value_counts()`**: After binning, this function counts the number of occurrences of each bin.\n- **`sort_index()`**: This is used to sort the result by the bin interval, so the output is in a logical order.\n\nThis will give you the count of values falling into each specified bin interval."
