        "content": "To parse HTML and extract text from specific elements in Python, you can use the `BeautifulSoup` library, which is part of the `bs4` package. Here's how you can achieve this with the given HTML:\n\nFirst, make sure you have `BeautifulSoup` installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install beautifulsoup4\n```\n\nNow, you can use the following code to extract the text:\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n# Your HTML source code\nsource_code = \"\"\"<span class=\"UserName\"><a href=\"#\">Martin Elias</a></span>\"\"\"\n\n# Create a BeautifulSoup object and specify the parser\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(source_code, 'html.parser')\n\n# Find the element and extract its text\ntext = soup.find('span', class_='UserName').get_text(strip=True)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(text)\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n\n```\nMartin Elias\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what the code does:\n\n1. It creates a `BeautifulSoup` object by passing the `source_code` and specifying the `html.parser` to parse the HTML.\n2. It uses the `find` method to locate the `span` element with the class `UserName`.\n3. It then calls `get_text(strip=True)` on the found element to retrieve the text content, with `strip=True` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace.\n4. Finally, it prints the extracted text."
