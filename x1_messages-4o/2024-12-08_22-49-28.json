However, there's a catch: you cannot use the built-in function \"map\". Can you do it using your logic and coding skills?\nHere's the template code to get you started:\n```go\npackage main\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n)\nfunc removeDuplicates(numbers []int) []int {\n\t// your code here\n}\nfunc main() {\n\tnumbers := []int{4, 2, 7, 1, 4, 3, 2, 7}\n\tfmt.Println(removeDuplicates(numbers))\n}\n```\nGood luck!"

        "content": "Certainly! You can solve this problem by using a different approach, such as iterating through the slice and maintaining another slice to store unique elements. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n)\n\nfunc removeDuplicates(numbers []int) []int {\n\tuniqueNumbers := []int{}\n\tseen := make(map[int]bool) // Using a map to keep track of seen numbers\n\n\tfor _, number := range numbers {\n\t\tif !seen[number] { // If the number hasn't been seen yet\n\t\t\tuniqueNumbers = append(uniqueNumbers, number) // Add it to the list of unique numbers\n\t\t\tseen[number] = true                           // Mark it as seen\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\treturn uniqueNumbers\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tnumbers := []int{4, 2, 7, 1, 4, 3, 2, 7}\n\tfmt.Println(removeDuplicates(numbers))\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialize an empty slice** `uniqueNumbers` to store the numbers without duplicates.\n2. **Create a map** `seen` to keep track of the numbers that have already been encountered.\n3. **Iterate through the input slice** `numbers`:\n   - Check if the current number is in the `seen` map.\n   - If it\u2019s not in the map, append it to the `uniqueNumbers` slice and mark it as seen by adding it to the `seen` map.\n4. **Return** the `uniqueNumbers` slice, which now contains only unique elements.\n\nThis approach efficiently removes duplicates while maintaining the original order of elements in the slice."
