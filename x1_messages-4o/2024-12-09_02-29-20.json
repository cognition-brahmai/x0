When I run the following code in the Python interpreter:\n\n```python\nfoo = 10\ndir(foo) == dir(10)  # Returns True\ndir(foo) is dir(10)  # Returns False\n```\nI'm not sure why the first comparison returns True and the second one returns False. Can someone explain why this is happening?"

        "content": "In Python, the `==` operator checks for equality of values, while the `is` operator checks for identity, meaning it checks whether two variables point to the same object in memory.\n\nLet's break down the code you provided:\n\n1. **`dir(foo) == dir(10)`**:\n   - `dir(foo)` and `dir(10)` both return a list of valid attributes for the integer object `10`. Since `foo` is assigned the value `10`, both calls to `dir()` will return identical lists of attributes (as they are both inspecting an integer object). Therefore, `dir(foo) == dir(10)` returns `True` because the contents of the lists are the same.\n\n2. **`dir(foo) is dir(10)`**:\n   - Even though the lists returned by `dir(foo)` and `dir(10)` are identical in content, they are two separate list objects created at the time of each `dir()` call. In Python, lists are mutable, so each call to `dir()` generates a new list object in memory.\n   - The `is` operator checks if the two operands refer to the exact same object in memory. In this case, they do not, because two separate list objects were created, thus `dir(foo) is dir(10)` returns `False`.\n\nIn summary, `==` checks for equality of values (contents), while `is` checks for identity (same memory location). That's why you observe the behavior you've described in your code."
