Below are the steps you can follow to set up this application:\n\n1. **Set Up Your React Environment:**\n   - First, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.\n   - You can create a new React application using Create React App by running the following command in your terminal:\n     ```bash\n     npx create-react-app employee-table\n     ```\n   - Navigate into your project directory:\n     ```bash\n     cd employee-table\n     ```\n\n2. **Create the Employee Table Component:**\n   - Inside the `src` directory, create a new file named `EmployeeTable.js`.\n   - Define a functional component that will render your table.\n\n3. **Code the Employee Table Component:**\n   - Here\u2019s a basic example of how you can structure the component to display employee data:\n\n   ```jsx\n   // src/EmployeeTable.js\n   import React from 'react';\n\n   const EmployeeTable = () => {\n     // Sample employee data\n     const employees = [\n       { id: 1, name: 'John Doe', position: 'Software Engineer', department: 'Development' },\n       { id: 2, name: 'Jane Smith', position: 'Project Manager', department: 'Management' },\n       { id: 3, name: 'Jake White', position: 'Designer', department: 'Design' },\n     ];\n\n     return (\n       <div>\n         <h2>Employee Information</h2>\n         <table border=\"1\" cellPadding=\"10\">\n           <thead>\n             <tr>\n               <th>ID</th>\n               <th>Name</th>\n               <th>Position</th>\n               <th>Department</th>\n             </tr>\n           </thead>\n           <tbody>\n             {employees.map((employee) => (\n               <tr key={employee.id}>\n                 <td>{employee.id}</td>\n                 <td>{employee.name}</td>\n                 <td>{employee.position}</td>\n                 <td>{employee.department}</td>\n               </tr>\n             ))}\n           </tbody>\n         </table>\n       </div>\n     );\n   };\n\n   export default EmployeeTable;\n   ```\n\n4. **Integrate the Component into Your App:**\n   - Open `src/App.js` and import the `EmployeeTable` component.\n   - Use the component within the `App` component.\n\n   ```jsx\n   // src/App.js\n   import React from 'react';\n   import './App.css';\n   import EmployeeTable from './EmployeeTable';\n\n   function App() {\n     return (\n       <div className=\"App\">\n         <header className=\"App-header\">\n           <h1>Company Employee Directory</h1>\n         </header>\n         <EmployeeTable />\n       </div>\n     );\n   }\n\n   export default App;\n   ```\n\n5. **Run Your Application:**\n   - Start your development server by running:\n     ```bash\n     npm start\n     ```\n   - This will open your application in the default web browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.\n\n6. **Styling and Enhancements:**\n   - You can add CSS in `App.css` or create a new CSS file for your component to style the table as desired.\n   - Consider adding features like sorting, filtering, or pagination for a more interactive experience.\n\nBy following these steps, you will have a basic React application that displays a table with employee information. You can further enhance it by connecting to an API or a backend to fetch real data."
