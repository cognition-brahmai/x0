Below are the implementations for both C# and JavaScript.\n\n### C# Program\n\nHere's a simple C# console application to calculate the product of 3 and 5 and display the result.\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        int number1 = 3;\n        int number2 = 5;\n        int product = number1 * number2;\n        \n        Console.WriteLine(\"The product of 3 and 5 is: \" + product);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo run this program, you would need to have a C# development environment like Visual Studio or use the .NET Core CLI tools.\n\n### JavaScript Program\n\nHere's how you can calculate the product of 3 and 5 and display the result on a web page using JavaScript and HTML.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Product Calculation</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Product of 3 and 5</h1>\n    <p id=\"result\"></p>\n\n    <script>\n        const number1 = 3;\n        const number2 = 5;\n        const product = number1 * number2;\n\n        document.getElementById('result').textContent = 'The product of 3 and 5 is: ' + product;\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nTo view this in action, save the HTML code in a `.html` file and open it with a web browser. This will display the calculated product on the page."
