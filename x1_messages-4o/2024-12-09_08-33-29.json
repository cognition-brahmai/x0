I want the rotation to follow the right-hand rule, meaning it should appear counter-clockwise to an observer for whom the axis vector is pointing. The vectors and angle are defined as follows:\n\n```python\nv = [3,5,0]\naxis = [4,4,1]\ntheta = 1.2 #radian\n```\n\nWhat is the best or easiest way to compute the resulting vector?"

        "content": "To rotate a 3D vector around a specified axis by a given angle, you can use Rodrigues' rotation formula. This formula provides an efficient way to perform the rotation using vector mathematics. Here's how you can implement it in Python:\n\nFirst, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Normalize the axis vector.\n2. Compute the cross product and dot product as needed.\n3. Use Rodrigues' rotation formula to compute the rotated vector.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing these steps:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given vectors and angle\nv = np.array([3, 5, 0])\naxis = np.array([4, 4, 1])\ntheta = 1.2  # Angle in radians\n\n# Step 1: Normalize the axis vector\naxis = axis / np.linalg.norm(axis)\n\n# Step 2: Compute the cross product and dot product\nv_cross = np.cross(axis, v)\nv_dot = np.dot(axis, v)\n\n# Step 3: Compute the rotated vector using Rodrigues' rotation formula\nv_rotated = (v * np.cos(theta) +\n             v_cross * np.sin(theta) +\n             axis * v_dot * (1 - np.cos(theta)))\n\nprint(\"Rotated vector:\", v_rotated)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Normalization**: The axis vector must be a unit vector to ensure the rotation is performed correctly.\n- **Cross Product**: `v_cross` is the vector perpendicular to both `v` and `axis`, which is used in the rotation.\n- **Dot Product**: `v_dot` helps in scaling the axis component of the rotation.\n- **Rodrigues' formula**: Combines these components to rotate the vector `v` around `axis` by `theta`.\n\nThis code will output the rotated vector, following the right-hand rule, as expected."
