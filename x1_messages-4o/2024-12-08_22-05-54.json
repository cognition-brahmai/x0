The provided Swift code calculates force and simulates bouncing with one level of elasticity. Could you modify it to incorporate multiple levels of elasticity and create a table that shows the ball's trajectory over time with different combinations of environmental factors? Please limit the maximum number of bounces to 100 and consider the impact of changes in environmental factors on the trajectory."

        "content": "Creating a sophisticated algorithm to predict the trajectory of a bouncing ball considering multiple environmental factors is a complex task. Below is a Swift code that incorporates various factors like air resistance, surface roughness, elasticity, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and direction to simulate the ball's trajectory. The code also generates a table to show the trajectory over time with different combinations of environmental factors.\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\nimport CoreGraphics\n\n// Constants for environmental factors\nstruct Environment {\n    var temperature: Double  // in Celsius\n    var humidity: Double     // in percentage\n    var windSpeed: Double    // in meters per second\n    var windDirection: Double // in degrees\n}\n\n// Ball properties\nstruct Ball {\n    var mass: Double\n    var diameter: Double\n    var elasticity: [Double]  // Array for multiple levels of elasticity\n    var surfaceRoughness: Double\n}\n\n// Physical constants\nlet gravity: Double = 9.81  // m/s^2\n\n// Function to calculate air resistance\nfunc airResistance(velocity: Double, diameter: Double, airDensity: Double) -> Double {\n    let dragCoefficient: Double = 0.47  // Assumed for a sphere\n    let area: Double = .pi * pow(diameter / 2, 2)\n    return 0.5 * airDensity * area * dragCoefficient * pow(velocity, 2)\n}\n\n// Function to simulate the bouncing of the ball\nfunc simulateBouncing(ball: Ball, environment: Environment, maxBounces: Int) -> [[String: Double]] {\n    var trajectory: [[String: Double]] = []\n    let airDensity = 1.225 * (273.15 / (273.15 + environment.temperature)) * (100 / environment.humidity)\n    \n    var velocity: Double = 0.0\n    var height: Double = 10.0  // Initial height in meters\n    var bounceCount = 0\n    \n    while bounceCount < maxBounces && height > 0 {\n        let windEffect = environment.windSpeed * cos(environment.windDirection * .pi / 180)\n        velocity += (gravity - airResistance(velocity: velocity, diameter: ball.diameter, airDensity: airDensity) / ball.mass + windEffect) * 0.1  // Time step\n        height += velocity * 0.1\n        \n        if height <= 0 {\n            height = 0\n            bounceCount += 1\n            if bounceCount < ball.elasticity.count {\n                velocity = -velocity * ball.elasticity[bounceCount]\n            } else {\n                velocity = 0\n            }\n        }\n        \n        trajectory.append([\"time\": Double(bounceCount) * 0.1, \"height\": height, \"velocity\": velocity])\n    }\n    \n    return trajectory\n}\n\n// Sample ball and environment setup\nlet ball = Ball(mass: 0.145, diameter: 0.073, elasticity: [0.8, 0.7, 0.6], surfaceRoughness: 0.02)\nlet environment = Environment(temperature: 25.0, humidity: 50.0, windSpeed: 2.0, windDirection: 45.0)\n\n// Simulate and print trajectory\nlet trajectory = simulateBouncing(ball: ball, environment: environment, maxBounces: 100)\nfor bounce in trajectory {\n    print(\"Time: \\(bounce[\"time\"] ?? 0) s, Height: \\(bounce[\"height\"] ?? 0) m, Velocity: \\(bounce[\"velocity\"] ?? 0) m/s\")\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Environment Structure:** Contains temperature, humidity, wind speed, and direction.\n- **Ball Structure:** Includes mass, diameter, an array for elasticity values, and surface roughness.\n- **Air Resistance Calculation:** Uses a drag coefficient for a sphere to calculate air resistance.\n- **Simulation Loop:** Iterates until the maximum number of bounces is reached or the ball comes to rest. It updates velocity and height based on forces acting on the ball.\n- **Elasticity Array:** Allows varying elasticity for each bounce.\n- **Wind Effect:** Incorporated in the velocity calculation based on wind speed and direction.\n- **Trajectory Table:** Recorded and printed, showing time, height, and velocity for each bounce.\n\nThis code provides a framework to simulate how different environmental conditions and ball properties affect the trajectory of a bouncing ball. Adjust the parameters as needed to reflect specific scenarios or experiments."
