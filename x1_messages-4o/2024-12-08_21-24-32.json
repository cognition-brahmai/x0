I want the output to be displayed on the console with each line of the song separated by a newline character. Can you provide me with a Java code that follows proper formatting standards and best practices in Java programming language?"

        "content": "Certainly! Below is a Java console application that uses a loop structure to generate the lyrics of the English alphabet song, from \"A\" to \"Z\". The code is written following Java programming best practices and proper formatting standards.\n\n```java\npublic class AlphabetSong {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Call the method to print the alphabet song\n        printAlphabetSong();\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Method to print the lyrics of the alphabet song from A to Z.\n     */\n    private static void printAlphabetSong() {\n        // Loop through the ASCII values of uppercase letters A to Z\n        for (char letter = 'A'; letter <= 'Z'; letter++) {\n            // Print each letter followed by a space\n            System.out.print(letter + \" \");\n        }\n        // Print the final line of the song\n        System.out.println(\"\\nNow I know my ABCs, next time won't you sing with me?\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `main` method is the entry point of the Java application. It calls the `printAlphabetSong` method.\n- The `printAlphabetSong` method contains a `for` loop that iterates through the ASCII values of the uppercase letters from 'A' to 'Z'.\n- Each letter is printed followed by a space to separate them.\n- After printing all the letters, a concluding line of the song is printed.\n- The use of `System.out.print` within the loop ensures that all letters appear on the same line, and `System.out.println` is used to move to the next line for the final sentence.\n\nThis code will display the complete lyrics of the alphabet song on the console, with each letter separated by a space and the final line appearing on a new line."
