I am able to take arguments from the form-data, using the POSTMAN plugin for chrome. But, when I switch to raw and feed a JSON, it fails to read the JSON and assigns a NONE to all my arguments. I am using python-2.6, Flask-Restful-0.3.3, Flask-0.10.1, Chrome, POSTMAN on Oracle Linux 6.5. How can I solve this issue?"

        "content": "When dealing with JSON data in Flask and Flask-RESTful, it's important to ensure that the request is correctly interpreted as JSON and that your code is set up to handle it. Here are some steps and tips to help you solve the issue:\n\n1. **Content-Type Header**: Make sure that the `Content-Type` header of your POST request is set to `application/json`. This tells Flask that the data being sent is in JSON format.\n\n2. **Accessing JSON Data**: In your Flask route or resource, use `request.get_json()` to access the JSON data. This method parses the incoming JSON request data.\n\n3. **Example Code**:\n   Here is an example of how to handle a POST request with JSON data using Flask-RESTful:\n\n   ```python\n   from flask import Flask, request\n   from flask_restful import Resource, Api\n\n   app = Flask(__name__)\n   api = Api(app)\n\n   class MyResource(Resource):\n       def post(self):\n           # Access the JSON data\n           json_data = request.get_json(force=True)  # Use force=True if you are sure it's JSON\n           if not json_data:\n               return {'message': 'No input data provided'}, 400\n\n           # Extract data from JSON\n           arg1 = json_data.get('arg1')\n           arg2 = json_data.get('arg2')\n\n           # Check if data is None\n           if arg1 is None or arg2 is None:\n               return {'message': 'Missing arguments in JSON'}, 400\n\n           # Process the data as needed\n           return {'message': 'Data received', 'arg1': arg1, 'arg2': arg2}, 200\n\n   api.add_resource(MyResource, '/myresource')\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       app.run(debug=True)\n   ```\n\n4. **POSTMAN Setup**: \n   - In POSTMAN, choose the \"Body\" tab and select \"raw\".\n   - Choose \"JSON (application/json)\" from the dropdown next to the raw option.\n   - Enter your JSON data in the editor. It should be correctly formatted, like this:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"arg1\": \"value1\",\n       \"arg2\": \"value2\"\n     }\n     ```\n\n5. **Debugging**: \n   - Check the Flask logs for any errors or clues if the request is not being processed correctly.\n   - Use `print` statements or logging to debug and see what data is being received.\n\n6. **Python Version**: \n   - Make sure you are using a compatible version of Python with your libraries. Python 2.6 is quite old, and you may want to consider upgrading to a more recent version like Python 3.6 or later if possible.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to correctly receive and process JSON data in your Flask application using Flask-RESTful."
