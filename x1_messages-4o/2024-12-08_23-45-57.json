The function should enable the player to move in any of the four directions, but not through walls. Additionally, how can I ensure that the function implements multiple-step reasoning and complex decision-making processes to find the optimal path? Please refer to the example maze matrix provided below for context."

        "content": "To solve this problem in MATLAB, you can implement a function that uses algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or A* to find the shortest path from the start position to the goal position in the binary matrix representation of the maze. Here's a step-by-step guide and example code using BFS for simplicity:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide\n\n1. **Representation**: Represent the maze as a binary matrix where `1`s are walls and `0`s are open paths.\n\n2. **Queue for BFS**: Use a queue to explore the maze. BFS is suitable because it finds the shortest path in an unweighted grid.\n\n3. **Tracking**: Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles and redundant checks.\n\n4. **Direction Vectors**: Define movement directions (up, down, left, right) using vectors.\n\n5. **Path Reconstruction**: Once the goal is reached, backtrack from the goal to the start using a parent map to reconstruct the path.\n\n### Example Code\n\nHere's an example function implementing BFS:\n\n```matlab\nfunction path = findOptimalPath(maze, start, goal)\n    % Define movement directions: up, down, left, right\n    directions = [0, 1; 1, 0; 0, -1; -1, 0];\n    \n    % Initialize BFS queue\n    queue = [start];\n    % Initialize visited matrix\n    visited = false(size(maze));\n    visited(start(1), start(2)) = true;\n    % Parent map to reconstruct the path\n    parentMap = containers.Map('KeyType', 'char', 'ValueType', 'any');\n    \n    % BFS loop\n    while ~isempty(queue)\n        % Dequeue the current position\n        current = queue(1, :);\n        queue(1, :) = [];\n        \n        % Check if the goal is reached\n        if isequal(current, goal)\n            path = reconstructPath(parentMap, start, goal);\n            return;\n        end\n        \n        % Explore neighbors\n        for i = 1:4\n            neighbor = current + directions(i, :);\n            % Check if neighbor is in bounds and not a wall\n            if isValid(neighbor, maze) && ~visited(neighbor(1), neighbor(2))\n                % Mark as visited\n                visited(neighbor(1), neighbor(2)) = true;\n                % Enqueue the neighbor\n                queue = [queue; neighbor];\n                % Record the parent for path reconstruction\n                parentMap(mat2str(neighbor)) = current;\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    % If no path found, return an empty array\n    path = [];\nend\n\nfunction isValid = isValid(position, maze)\n    rows = size(maze, 1);\n    cols = size(maze, 2);\n    row = position(1);\n    col = position(2);\n    isValid = row >= 1 && row <= rows && col >= 1 && col <= cols && maze(row, col) == 0;\nend\n\nfunction path = reconstructPath(parentMap, start, goal)\n    path = goal;\n    while ~isequal(path(1, :), start)\n        path = [parentMap(mat2str(path(1, :))); path];\n    end\nend\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nTo use this function, define your maze, start, and goal positions:\n\n```matlab\nmaze = [\n    1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1;\n    1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1;\n    1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1;\n    1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1;\n    1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1;\n    1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1\n];\n\nstart = [2, 2];\ngoal = [4, 5];\n\noptimalPath = findOptimalPath(maze, start, goal);\ndisp('Optimal Path:');\ndisp(optimalPath);\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how to find an optimal path through a maze using BFS. The function `findOptimalPath` will return a sequence of coordinates representing the optimal path from the starting position to the goal in the maze. Adjust the maze matrix, start, and goal positions as needed for your specific scenario."
