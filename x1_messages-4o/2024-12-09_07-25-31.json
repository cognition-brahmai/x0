How can I remove only the last character without using regex?"

For your specific case, where you want to remove the last '/' from the end of the file path, you can simply slice the string to exclude the last character. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nmy_file_path = '/home/ro/A_Python_Scripts/flask-auto/myDirectory/scarlett Johanson/1448543562.17.jpg/'\n\n# Check if the last character is '/', then remove it\nif my_file_path.endswith('/'):\n    my_file_path = my_file_path[:-1]\n\nprint(my_file_path)\n```\n\nThis code checks if the last character of the string is a '/' and, if so, creates a new string without the last character using slicing (`my_file_path[:-1]`). This is a simple and efficient way to achieve your goal without using regex."
