In the past, Python seems to have supported a %z format tag in the strptime method for parsing the trailing timezone specification, but it seems like this functionality has been removed in version 2.6.x. How should I go about correctly parsing this date string into a datetime object?"

        "content": "In Python, parsing date strings with time zone information can be a bit tricky, especially if you're using older versions that have limited support for certain format specifiers like `%z`. However, there are several ways to handle this situation:\n\n1. **Using `datetime.strptime` with `pytz`:**\n\n   While `%z` might not work in some older versions, you can manually handle the timezone offset. You can parse the date and time separately from the timezone, then apply the timezone using the `pytz` library.\n\n   Here's how you can do it:\n\n   ```python\n   from datetime import datetime\n   import pytz\n   import re\n\n   date_str = '2009/05/13 19:19:30 -0400'\n\n   # Separate the date and time from the timezone\n   dt_str, tz_str = date_str.rsplit(' ', 1)\n\n   # Parse the date and time\n   dt = datetime.strptime(dt_str, '%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S')\n\n   # Parse the timezone\n   tz_offset = int(tz_str[:3]) * 60 + int(tz_str[1:3]) * (1 if tz_str[0] == '+' else -1)\n   tz_info = pytz.FixedOffset(tz_offset)\n\n   # Apply the timezone to the datetime object\n   dt = dt.replace(tzinfo=tz_info)\n\n   print(dt)\n   ```\n\n2. **Using `dateutil.parser`:**\n\n   The `dateutil` library is very flexible and can handle many date formats, including those with timezone information, without needing to specify a format string.\n\n   First, you need to install the library if you haven't:\n\n   ```\n   pip install python-dateutil\n   ```\n\n   Then, you can use it as follows:\n\n   ```python\n   from dateutil import parser\n\n   date_str = '2009/05/13 19:19:30 -0400'\n   dt = parser.parse(date_str)\n\n   print(dt)\n   ```\n\n`dateutil`'s `parser.parse()` function is very robust and can automatically handle the timezone offset present in the string.\n\nUsing the `dateutil` library is generally recommended for most flexible parsing tasks due to its simplicity and ability to handle a wide range of date formats and time zones."
