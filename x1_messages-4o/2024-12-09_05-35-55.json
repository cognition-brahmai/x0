In the command line test session results, I'm noticing that even though my tests are passing, the percentage displayed is not 100% for some tests. I have confirmed through aggressive logging that my tests are indeed passing. So, what does the percentage displayed for the collected tests signify? Here is an example of the test results:\n\n```\nplatform win32 -- Python 3.7.0a4, pytest-3.5.0, py-1.5.3, pluggy-0.6.0\nrootdir: C:\\api-check, inifile:\ncollected 5 items\n\ntest_Me.py ...                                                           [ 60%]\ntest_env.py ..                                                           [100%]\n\n========================== 5 passed in 6.04 seconds ===========================\n```"
    },

        "content": "The percentage displayed in the pytest test session results represents the progress of the test execution, not the pass percentage of the tests. Each dot (\".\") in the output represents a test that has been executed, and the percentage indicates how far along the test runner is in executing all collected tests.\n\nIn your example:\n\n```\ntest_Me.py ...                                                           [ 60%]\ntest_env.py ..                                                           [100%]\n```\n\n- `test_Me.py` contains 3 tests, and when these tests have been executed, pytest shows `[ 60%]`, which means that 60% of all collected tests have been executed at this point.\n- `test_env.py` contains 2 tests, and after these tests are executed, pytest shows `[100%]`, meaning all collected tests have been executed.\n\nIn total, you have 5 tests (3 in `test_Me.py` and 2 in `test_env.py`), and all of them have passed. The percentage progression just shows the execution progress, not the success rate. Since all your tests are passing, you are seeing \"5 passed\" at the end of the output, indicating a 100% pass rate for your tests."
