        "content": "When dealing with Python packages, it is not possible to directly rename a package during installation using PIP. However, there are a few workarounds you can consider:\n\n1. **Virtual Environments**: The most common and cleanest solution is to use Python virtual environments. Virtual environments allow you to create isolated environments for different projects, each with its own set of installed packages. This way, you can have different versions or packages with the same name installed in separate environments without conflict.\n\n    To create a virtual environment:\n    ```bash\n    python -m venv myenv\n    ```\n\n    Activate the virtual environment:\n    - On Windows:\n      ```bash\n      myenv\\Scripts\\activate\n      ```\n    - On macOS/Linux:\n      ```bash\n      source myenv/bin/activate\n      ```\n\n    Then, install your package within the activated virtual environment.\n\n2. **Renaming the Package Locally**: If you must rename the package itself, you can download the package source code, rename it, and then install it manually. Here's how you can do it:\n\n    - Download the package source code using PIP:\n      ```bash\n      pip download package-name\n      ```\n\n    - Extract the downloaded package archive.\n    - Rename the package folder inside the extracted content.\n    - Modify the `setup.py` or any relevant files to use the new name.\n    - Install the modified package using:\n      ```bash\n      pip install path/to/modified/package\n      ```\n\n3. **Namespace Packages**: If the package allows, you can use namespace packages which let you use the same package structure under different names, but this requires both packages to support such a structure.\n\n4. **Forking and Customizing**: If the package is open source, you can fork the repository, change the package name in the source, and then install your forked version. This is more involved but gives you full control over the package.\n\nRemember that renaming packages can lead to confusion and potential issues with dependencies, so it's generally recommended to use virtual environments for isolation whenever possible."
