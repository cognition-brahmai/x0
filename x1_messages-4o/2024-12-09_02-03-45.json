When I evaluate `(True == False) is False` or `True == (False is False)`, both expressions return True. However, `True == False is False` returns False. Additionally, when I check the identities of True, False, and the results of these comparisons with `id()`, I get different results. Here's what I've found:\n\n```python\n>>> (True == False) is False\nTrue\n>>> True == (False is False)\nTrue\n>>> True == False is False\nFalse\n>>> id(True)\n8978640\n>>> id(False)\n8978192\n>>> id(True == False)\n8978192\n>>> id(False is False)\n8978640\n```"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is due to the way Python evaluates expressions involving the `==` and `is` operators. Let's break down the expressions and see what's happening in each case:\n\n### Expression Breakdown\n\n1. **`(True == False) is False`**\n\n   - `(True == False)` evaluates to `False`.\n   - Then, you have `False is False`, which compares the identity of the two `False` objects.\n   - Since both refer to the same object (singleton `False`), the result is `True`.\n\n2. **`True == (False is False)`**\n\n   - `(False is False)` evaluates to `True` because both `False` literals are the same singleton object.\n   - Then, you have `True == True`, which evaluates to `True`.\n\n3. **`True == False is False`**\n\n   - This is evaluated using Python's chaining behavior for comparison operators.\n   - It is interpreted as `(True == False) and (False is False)`.\n   - `(True == False)` evaluates to `False`.\n   - `(False is False)` evaluates to `True`.\n   - Therefore, `False and True` evaluates to `False`.\n\n### Identity and `id()` Function\n\nRegarding the `id()` function results:\n\n- `id(True)` and `id(False)` return different values because they are different singleton objects.\n- `id(True == False)` returns the same ID as `False` because `True == False` evaluates to `False`.\n- `id(False is False)` returns the same ID as `True` because `False is False` evaluates to `True`.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- The `is` operator checks identity (whether two references point to the same object), while `==` checks equality (whether the values are equivalent).\n- In chained comparisons like `a == b is c`, Python evaluates it as `(a == b) and (b is c)`.\n- Always use parentheses to clarify expressions when mixing `==` and `is` to avoid unintended behavior.\n\nUnderstanding these nuances can help avoid unexpected results when working with `==` and `is` in Python."
