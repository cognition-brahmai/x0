Each column must be able to accommodate a minimum of 10 alphanumeric characters. The first column must contain left-aligned text while the second column must contain centered text. Finally, the third column must contain right-aligned text. The table must be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes. The output code should be generated programmatically without the use of any external libraries or plugins. Please ensure that the code is optimized for faster rendering and does not contain any syntax errors."
