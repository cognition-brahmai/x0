When I try to convert my 2-dimensional array to a pandas.Series, I get an exception stating \"Data must be 1-dimensional\". I tried to reshape it into a 1-dimensional array, but it seems to still be multi-dimensional because there are double square brackets. Even though I found information saying that ndarray and array are the same, they are not working the same in my situation. Below is my current code and its output.\n\n```python\nt\n# Output: array([[ 0.,  0.,  0.],[ 0.,  0.,  0.],[ 0.,  0.,  0.]])\n\npandas.Series(t)\n# Output: Exception: Data must be 1-dimensional\n\ntt = t.reshape((1,-1))\ntt\n# Output: array([[ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.]])\n```"

        "content": "To convert a multi-dimensional `ndarray` into a 1-dimensional array in Python, you can use the `flatten()` method or the `ravel()` method provided by NumPy. These methods will effectively transform your 2-dimensional array into a 1-dimensional array. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using `flatten()`**:\n   ```python\n   import numpy as np\n   import pandas as pd\n\n   t = np.array([[0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0.]])\n   t_flattened = t.flatten()\n\n   # Now you can convert it to a pandas Series\n   series = pd.Series(t_flattened)\n   print(series)\n   ```\n\n2. **Using `ravel()`**:\n   ```python\n   import numpy as np\n   import pandas as pd\n\n   t = np.array([[0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0.]])\n   t_raveled = t.ravel()\n\n   # Now you can convert it to a pandas Series\n   series = pd.Series(t_raveled)\n   print(series)\n   ```\n\nBoth `flatten()` and `ravel()` will give you a 1-dimensional view of the original array, but `ravel()` is often faster as it returns a flattened view if possible, whereas `flatten()` always returns a copy.\n\nUsing either of these methods, you should be able to convert your array into a format that can be easily transformed into a `pandas.Series` without encountering the \"Data must be 1-dimensional\" exception."
