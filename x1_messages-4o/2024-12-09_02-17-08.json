Are there other methods I could use to achieve this utf-8 to ASCII conversion?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is because you are trying to encode an already encoded byte string, which is not the correct approach. To convert a UTF-8 file to an ASCII file while ignoring characters that cannot be represented in ASCII, you should first decode the byte string to a Unicode string and then encode it to ASCII. Here's how you can modify your script:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n# *-* coding: iso-8859-1 *-*\n\nimport sys\nimport os\n\nfilePath = \"test.lrc\"\n\n# Open the file in binary mode and read its content\nwith open(filePath, \"rb\") as fichier:\n    contentOfFile = fichier.read()\n\n# Decode the content from UTF-8 to a Unicode string\nunicodeContent = contentOfFile.decode(\"utf-8\")\n\n# Encode the Unicode string to ASCII, ignoring errors\nasciiContent = unicodeContent.encode(\"ascii\", \"ignore\")\n\n# Write the ASCII content to a new file\nwith open(\"tempASCII\", \"wb\") as fichierTemp:\n    fichierTemp.write(asciiContent)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Decoding**: The byte string is decoded from UTF-8 to a Unicode string.\n2. **Encoding**: The Unicode string is then encoded to ASCII with the 'ignore' option to skip characters that cannot be represented in ASCII.\n3. **File Mode**: Use binary mode (`'wb'`) when writing the ASCII content to ensure that the binary data is written correctly.\n\nThis approach ensures that you first work with a decoded Unicode string, allowing the `encode` method to function as expected when converting to ASCII."
