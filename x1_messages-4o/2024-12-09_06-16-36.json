        "content": "To read multiple text files from multiple zip files without extracting them, you can use the `zipfile` module in combination with `pandas`. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n1. Loop through each zip file.\n2. Use the `zipfile` module to open each zip file.\n3. Loop through each file within the zip archive.\n4. Use `pandas.read_csv()` to read each text file, specifying the file-like object.\n\nHere's a sample code to demonstrate this process:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport zipfile\nimport os\n\ndef read_multiple_files_from_zip(zip_paths):\n    all_dataframes = []\n    \n    for zip_path in zip_paths:\n        with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_path, 'r') as z:\n            for filename in z.namelist():\n                if filename.endswith('.csv'):  # Assuming the text files are CSVs\n                    with z.open(filename) as file:\n                        # Read the file into a DataFrame\n                        df = pd.read_csv(file)\n                        # Optionally, add a column to identify the source file\n                        df['source_file'] = os.path.basename(filename)\n                        all_dataframes.append(df)\n    \n    # Concatenate all the DataFrames into one\n    combined_df = pd.concat(all_dataframes, ignore_index=True)\n    return combined_df\n\n# Example usage:\nzip_files = ['zip_file1.zip', 'zip_file2.zip']  # Add your zip file paths here\ncombined_dataframe = read_multiple_files_from_zip(zip_files)\nprint(combined_dataframe)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **zipfile.ZipFile**: Opens the zip file in read mode.\n- **z.namelist()**: Lists all the files within the zip archive.\n- **z.open(filename)**: Opens each file within the zip without extracting it to the filesystem.\n- **pandas.read_csv(file)**: Reads the file-like object returned by `z.open()`.\n- **Concatenation**: Finally, all individual DataFrames are concatenated into one large DataFrame.\n\nThis approach allows you to read multiple text files from multiple zip files directly into pandas DataFrames without having to extract them to disk. Adjust the `if filename.endswith('.csv')` condition if your text files have a different extension."
