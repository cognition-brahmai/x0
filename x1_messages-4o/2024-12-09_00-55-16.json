I have fetched data as a dictionary, and I can manually update each field of a user in the Django database using `old_user.field = fetched_data['field']` and `old_user.save()`. However, I want to automate this process by looping through the keys in the `fetched_data` dictionary, but my attempts so far have been unsuccessful. Here's the code I've tried:\n\n```python\nfetched_data = {\n     'id': 1,\n     'first_name': 'John',\n     'last_name': 'Doe',\n     'phone': '+32 12',\n     'mobile_phone': '+32 13',\n     'email': 'myemail@hotmail.com',\n     'username': 'myusername'\n}\n\nold_user = User.objects.get(pk=fetched_data['id'])\n\nfor fetched_data_key in fetched_data:\n    old_user.fetched_data_key = fetched_data['fetched_data_key']\n    //old_user[fetched_data_key] = fetched_data['fetched_data_key'] --- I tried this way too\n    old_user.save()\n```\n\nBut this doesn't work. Do you have any suggestions on how I can update the user without having to write a line of code for each record?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is due to how you're trying to access and update the fields of the `old_user` object. In your current approach, you're trying to access attributes using a string, which won't work as expected. Instead, you should use the `setattr` function to dynamically set attributes on the object.\n\nHere's how you can efficiently update multiple fields of a Django model object using a dictionary:\n\n```python\nfetched_data = {\n     'id': 1,\n     'first_name': 'John',\n     'last_name': 'Doe',\n     'phone': '+32 12',\n     'mobile_phone': '+32 13',\n     'email': 'myemail@hotmail.com',\n     'username': 'myusername'\n}\n\nold_user = User.objects.get(pk=fetched_data['id'])\n\n# Loop over the keys and values in the fetched_data dictionary\nfor key, value in fetched_data.items():\n    if key != 'id':  # Skip the 'id' field if it's included in the fetched_data\n        setattr(old_user, key, value)  # Use setattr to set the attribute\n\nold_user.save()  # Save the updated user object\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`setattr(object, name, value)`**: This function is used to set the value of an attribute of an object dynamically. Here, `object` is the object you want to modify (`old_user`), `name` is the attribute name (e.g., `'first_name'`) as a string, and `value` is the value you want to assign to that attribute.\n- **Skipping 'id'**: Since the 'id' is typically used to uniquely identify the object in the database, you usually don't want to update it unless there's a specific need.\n\nThis approach will efficiently update the fields of the `old_user` object based on the keys and values in your `fetched_data` dictionary."
