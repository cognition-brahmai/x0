However, I am not clear about what '2**16' signifies. Can anyone explain the function of this double asterisk operator?"

        "content": "Certainly! In Python, the double asterisk operator (`**`) is used to perform exponentiation. This means that it raises a number to the power of another number.\n\nIn the expression `2**16`, the base is `2`, and the exponent is `16`. This means you are calculating \\(2^{16}\\), which evaluates to 65536. \n\nSo, in the context of `sock.recvfrom(2**16)`, it is specifying that the `recvfrom` function should attempt to receive up to 65536 bytes of data from the socket. This is a common size used for buffer allocation in network communications, particularly for operations involving UDP packets, where it represents the maximum size of the datagram that can be received."
