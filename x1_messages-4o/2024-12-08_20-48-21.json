Your job is to create a function that takes in a list of outfit descriptions and returns the appropriate image to display on the app. \nThe outfit descriptions will be in the following format:\n- \"casual, summer, beach\"\n- \"formal, winter, evening\"\n- \"business, spring, daytime\"\nYou have been provided with a folder of images named according to the following format: \n- casual_summer_beach.jpg\n- formal_winter_evening.jpg\n- business_spring_daytime.jpg\nYour function should take in the list of outfit descriptions and return the appropriate image filename to display on the app. The function should also be able to handle any new outfit descriptions that may be added in the future.\nAs an example, if the input list is [\"casual, summer, beach\"], the function should return \"casual_summer_beach.jpg\". \nNote: The image filenames should be returned as a string with no additional characters or formatting."

        "content": "To create a function that returns the appropriate image filename based on the outfit descriptions, you can parse the input description strings and construct the corresponding filenames. Here's a Python function to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef get_outfit_image_filenames(outfit_descriptions):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the filenames\n    filenames = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each description in the list\n    for description in outfit_descriptions:\n        # Remove any spaces and replace commas with underscores\n        formatted_description = description.replace(\", \", \"_\")\n        \n        # Append the \".jpg\" extension to the formatted description\n        filename = f\"{formatted_description}.jpg\"\n        \n        # Add the filename to the list\n        filenames.append(filename)\n    \n    # Return the list of filenames\n    return filenames\n\n# Example usage\noutfit_descriptions = [\"casual, summer, beach\", \"formal, winter, evening\", \"business, spring, daytime\"]\nimage_filenames = get_outfit_image_filenames(outfit_descriptions)\nprint(image_filenames)  # Output: ['casual_summer_beach.jpg', 'formal_winter_evening.jpg', 'business_spring_daytime.jpg']\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Input Parsing**: The input list contains descriptions in the format \"style, season, occasion\".\n2. **String Formatting**: For each description, commas followed by spaces are replaced with underscores to match the naming convention of the image files.\n3. **Appending the Extension**: After formatting the description, \".jpg\" is appended to form the complete filename.\n4. **Output**: The function returns a list of filenames corresponding to the input descriptions.\n\nThis function is flexible enough to handle any new outfit descriptions added in the future, as long as they follow the same description format."
