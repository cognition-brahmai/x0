Both functions accept three different scales: `'linear'`, `'log'`, and `'symlog'`. However, I am not able to understand the difference between `'log'` and `'symlog'`. They seem to appear the same in a simple test I conducted. Despite the documentation stating they accept different parameters, I am still confused about their distinction. Could anyone clarify this for me? What does 'symlog' stand for and how does it differ from 'log'?"

        "content": "Certainly! The `'log'` and `'symlog'` scales in Matplotlib are both used to transform the axis to better handle data with a wide range of values, but they serve slightly different purposes and behave differently.\n\n### `'log'` Scale:\n- The `'log'` scale is the standard logarithmic scale, which is useful for data that spans several orders of magnitude. It compresses the range of data by plotting the logarithm of the values.\n- On a `'log'` scale, you cannot have zero or negative values because logarithms of zero or negative numbers are undefined in the real number domain.\n- This scale is ideal for positive data that varies exponentially.\n\n### `'symlog'` Scale:\n- The `'symlog'` scale, short for \"symmetric logarithmic\", is designed to handle both positive and negative values, while still providing the benefits of a logarithmic scale.\n- It introduces a linear region around zero, allowing you to plot data that includes zero or values close to it, which would otherwise be problematic for a traditional `'log'` scale.\n- The `'symlog'` scale is useful when your data includes both large and small (including negative) values, and you want to visualize these on a logarithmic scale without losing the zero or negative part.\n\n### Key Differences:\n1. **Handling of Negative Values and Zero:**\n   - `'log'`: Only positive values are allowed.\n   - `'symlog'`: Can handle negative values and zero by using a linear scale near zero.\n\n2. **Parameters:**\n   - `'symlog'` accepts an additional parameter called `linthresh`, which specifies the range around zero within which the plot is linear. This helps avoid the undefined logarithmic values at zero.\n\n3. **Use Cases:**\n   - Use `'log'` when you have strictly positive values and want a logarithmic representation.\n   - Use `'symlog'` when your data set includes both positive and negative values or zero, and you still want the benefits of logarithmic scaling.\n\n### Example:\nIf you have a data set ranging from -1000 to 1000 and you want to plot it using a logarithmic scale, you would use `'symlog'`. Here you can set `linthresh` to define the linear region, for instance:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\nx = np.linspace(-1000, 1000, 400)\ny = np.sinh(x)\n\nplt.plot(x, y)\nplt.xscale('symlog', linthresh=0.01)\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this example, a linear region around zero is used to accommodate the negative and zero values, while the rest of the data is plotted logarithmically."
