The old car represents something of value you currently possess, like money or an asset. You negotiate with the dealer, who evaluates the worth of your old car and offers you a deal on the new car, similar to how terms are agreed upon in a financial transaction. \n\nOnce both parties agree, you hand over your old car and, in return, receive the keys to the new car. This exchange represents the completion of a transaction. Just as a transaction involves transferring value from one party to another, the car exchange involves transferring ownership from you to the dealer and vice versa. \n\nThe paperwork you complete during this process is akin to the documentation involved in a transaction, ensuring everything is legally binding and recorded."
