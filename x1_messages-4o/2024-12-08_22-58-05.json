        "content": "Certainly! Let's break down the PHP code and understand how it calculates the total cost of the wind turbine components, including tax:\n\n1. **Data Structure**:\n   - The components and their details are stored in a multi-dimensional array called `$components`. Each sub-array represents a component and contains three elements: the component name, the quantity, and the price per unit.\n\n2. **Tax Rate**:\n   - The tax rate is defined as a constant value of `0.07`, which corresponds to a 7% tax rate.\n\n3. **Total Cost Initialization**:\n   - A variable `$total_cost` is initialized to 0. This will be used to accumulate the total cost of all components.\n\n4. **Loop Through Components**:\n   - A `foreach` loop iterates over each component in the `$components` array.\n   - For each component, it calculates the cost by multiplying the quantity (`$component[1]`) by the price per unit (`$component[2]`).\n\n5. **Component Cost Calculation**:\n   - The calculated cost of each component is stored in the variable `$component_cost`.\n   - This cost is then added to the `$total_cost` to accumulate the total cost of all components.\n\n6. **Output Component Cost**:\n   - The script outputs the cost of each individual component using the `echo` statement, displaying the component name and its cost.\n\n7. **Tax Calculation**:\n   - After calculating the total cost of all components, the tax is computed by multiplying the `$total_cost` by the `$tax_rate` (7%).\n   - The resulting tax amount is stored in the variable `$tax`.\n\n8. **Final Total Cost**:\n   - The total cost, including the tax, is obtained by adding the `$tax` to the `$total_cost`.\n\n9. **Output Total Cost**:\n   - Finally, the script outputs the total combined cost of all components including tax, and explicitly states the amount of tax included.\n\nBy following these steps, the PHP code effectively calculates both the total cost of the wind turbine components and the total cost including tax, providing a clear breakdown of how each component contributes to the overall expense."
