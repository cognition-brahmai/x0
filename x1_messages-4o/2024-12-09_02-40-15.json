In Python 2.x, I use 'file-like' objects as shown in the code below:\n\n```python\nsys.stdout.write(bytes_)\ntempfile.TemporaryFile().write(bytes_)\nopen('filename', 'wb').write(bytes_)\nStringIO().write(bytes_)\n```\n\nAlso, I have a function in Python 2.x:\n\n```python\ndef write(file_, bytes_):\n    file_.write(bytes_)\n```\nHow can I do the same in Python 3? For instance, in a case where `sys.stdout` is not always semantically a text stream and it might be beneficial to consider it as a stream of bytes sometimes, like in the following command: \n\n```command\ntar -c dir/ | gzip | gpg -c | ssh user@remote 'dd of=dir.tar.gz.gpg'\n```\n\nIn this case, there is no point to use Unicode. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "In Python 3, the handling of bytes and strings has been made more explicit. You need to ensure that you're handling bytes when working with streams that expect binary data. Here's how you can achieve the same functionality in Python 3:\n\n### Writing Bytes to File-Like Objects\n\nIn Python 3, you should open files in binary mode (`'wb'`) when writing bytes. Here's how to handle different file-like objects:\n\n1. **Standard Output**: Use `sys.stdout.buffer` to write bytes directly to standard output.\n\n2. **Temporary Files**: Use `tempfile.TemporaryFile()` in binary mode.\n\n3. **Opening Files**: Use the `'wb'` mode to write bytes.\n\n4. **BytesIO**: Use `io.BytesIO()` instead of `StringIO`.\n\nHere's the equivalent code in Python 3:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport tempfile\nimport io\n\n# Write bytes directly to standard output\nsys.stdout.buffer.write(bytes_)\n\n# Write bytes to a temporary file\nwith tempfile.TemporaryFile() as temp_file:\n    temp_file.write(bytes_)\n\n# Write bytes to a regular file\nwith open('filename', 'wb') as file:\n    file.write(bytes_)\n\n# Write bytes to a BytesIO object\nbytes_io = io.BytesIO()\nbytes_io.write(bytes_)\n```\n\n### Function for Writing Bytes\n\nYou can define a similar function in Python 3 to handle writing bytes to a file-like object:\n\n```python\ndef write(file_, bytes_):\n    file_.write(bytes_)\n```\n\n### Handling `sys.stdout` as a Byte Stream\n\nWhen dealing with scenarios where `sys.stdout` is not always a text stream, you can access the buffer directly to write bytes:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Write bytes to stdout as a byte stream\nsys.stdout.buffer.write(bytes_)\n```\n\nBy using `.buffer` on `sys.stdout`, you bypass the text encoding layer and write raw bytes directly, which is useful for binary data or when piping data between processes.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nFor a command-line scenario like the one you described, where you're dealing with streams of bytes, using the `.buffer` attribute is appropriate. This way, you ensure that you are operating with raw bytes, maintaining compatibility with tools that operate on binary data.\n\nBy following these practices, you can effectively handle bytes in Python 3 without needing to worry about encoding issues that are more prevalent with text data."
