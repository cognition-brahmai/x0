Additionally, please prompt the user to provide a secondary form of authentication, like a phone number or security question, to generate an access token using the secret key. To make the CAPTCHA verification page accessible to visually impaired users, an audio option should also be added. Moreover, the confirmation email sent to the user should include a link to a password reset page. To ensure continuous security, the server should periodically prompt users to update their passwords. Can you please confirm that you have understood these requirements and are ready to proceed?"
