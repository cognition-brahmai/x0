I have tried a few methods such as using a thread and joining it with a timeout then killing it if it exceeds the timeout, but this seems to be bad practice as it uses a private function. I've also tried using `signal.SIGALRM` but it doesn't work on Windows. Another approach I tried was using a subprocess with a timeout, but this felt too heavy especially for frequent interruptible tasks. I want a solution that works on both Linux and Windows, where I can run a function with a timeout and regain control if the timeout elapses."

        "content": "To run a piece of code with a timeout in Python that works across different platforms like Windows and Linux, you can use the `concurrent.futures` module, which provides a high-level interface for asynchronously executing callables. Here's a way to achieve this using `ThreadPoolExecutor`:\n\n```python\nimport concurrent.futures\nimport time\n\n# Sample function to demonstrate timeout\ndef long_running_function(seconds):\n    print(f\"Starting task for {seconds} seconds\")\n    time.sleep(seconds)\n    return f\"Completed task in {seconds} seconds\"\n\n# Function to run with a timeout\ndef run_with_timeout(func, args=(), timeout=None):\n    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n        future = executor.submit(func, *args)\n        try:\n            result = future.result(timeout=timeout)\n            return result\n        except concurrent.futures.TimeoutError:\n            return \"Function call timed out\"\n\n# Example usage\nresult = run_with_timeout(long_running_function, args=(5,), timeout=3)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **ThreadPoolExecutor**: This allows you to run functions asynchronously in separate threads. It's part of the `concurrent.futures` module and is available in Python 3.2 and later.\n\n2. **submit**: This method schedules the callable to be executed and returns a `Future` object.\n\n3. **result**: This method of the `Future` object retrieves the result of the callable. It accepts a `timeout` parameter and raises a `TimeoutError` if the callable does not finish executing within the specified time.\n\n4. **Cross-platform**: This approach works on both Linux and Windows as it uses Python's thread-based concurrency model which is cross-platform.\n\nThis method is efficient for tasks that are interruptible and don't require heavy resources like subprocesses, and it also avoids the use of private functions or signals specific to Unix-like systems. Always ensure that the function you are running is thread-safe, as this approach uses threads."
