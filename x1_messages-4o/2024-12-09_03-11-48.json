        "content": "To override and implement your own form for a specific model in Django admin, such as the `Invoice` model, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create a Custom Form:**\n\n   First, create a custom form for the `Invoice` model. This form will include the fields you want to customize and any additional validation logic.\n\n   ```python\n   from django import forms\n   from .models import Invoice, Customer, Product\n\n   class InvoiceForm(forms.ModelForm):\n       class Meta:\n           model = Invoice\n           fields = ['customer', 'product', 'amount']\n\n       def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n           super(InvoiceForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n\n           # Auto-fill customer and product fields with dropdowns\n           self.fields['customer'].queryset = Customer.objects.all()\n           self.fields['product'].queryset = Product.objects.all()\n\n       def clean(self):\n           cleaned_data = super().clean()\n           customer = cleaned_data.get('customer')\n           amount = cleaned_data.get('amount')\n\n           # Custom validation for credit limit\n           if customer and amount:\n               if amount > customer.credit_limit:\n                   self.add_error('amount', f'The invoice amount exceeds the credit limit for {customer.name}.')\n\n           return cleaned_data\n   ```\n\n2. **Override the Admin Class:**\n\n   Next, you need to override the admin class for the `Invoice` model to use your custom form.\n\n   ```python\n   from django.contrib import admin\n   from .models import Invoice\n   from .forms import InvoiceForm\n\n   class InvoiceAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n       form = InvoiceForm\n\n       # Optionally, you can customize the list display and filters\n       list_display = ['customer', 'product', 'amount', 'date']\n       list_filter = ['customer', 'product']\n\n   # Register the model with the customized admin\n   admin.site.register(Invoice, InvoiceAdmin)\n   ```\n\n3. **Customize Auto-fill Fields:**\n\n   In the custom form, you're already setting up dropdowns for the `customer` and `product` fields using the `queryset`. This auto-fills the fields with available options from the `Customer` and `Product` models.\n\n4. **Add Custom Validation:**\n\n   The `clean` method in your custom form handles additional validation logic. In this case, it checks if the invoice amount does not exceed the customer's credit limit. If it does, it adds an error to the form.\n\nWith these steps, you have overridden the default form for the `Invoice` model in the Django admin, providing custom auto-fill fields and validation logic. Remember to adjust the field names and logic according to your specific model and requirements."
