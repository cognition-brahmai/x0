I'm using Python 3.5 and when I try to run my program, I'm getting an error that says `NameError: name 'raw_input' is not defined`. Here's the error I receive when I run my program:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"C:\\Users\\morrris\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python35-32\\guess_that_number.py\", line 7, in &lt;module&gt;\nname= raw_input()\nNameError: name 'raw_input' is not defined\n```\nI've attempted to modify the code, but it doesn't seem to like the `raw_input()` function. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, `NameError: name 'raw_input' is not defined`, is because in Python 3, the `raw_input()` function has been replaced with `input()`. The `raw_input()` function was used in Python 2 to take input from the user and return it as a string, but in Python 3, `input()` serves the same purpose.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can modify your code to work with Python 3:\n\nReplace any occurrence of `raw_input()` with `input()`. Here is an example of how you might adjust your code:\n\n```python\n# Example of a \"guess the number\" game\n\nimport random\n\ndef guess_the_number():\n    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)\n    print(\"Welcome to 'Guess the Number'!\")\n    print(\"Try to guess the number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    while True:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(\"Enter your guess: \"))  # Use input() instead of raw_input()\n            if guess < number_to_guess:\n                print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n            elif guess > number_to_guess:\n                print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Congratulations! You guessed the number.\")\n                break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid number.\")\n\nguess_the_number()\n```\n\nMake sure to replace all instances of `raw_input()` in your code with `input()` to ensure compatibility with Python 3. This should resolve the error, and your program should run as expected."
