To fix this, you should add 1 to each element instead of multiplying it. Here's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\nfor i in my_list:\n    print(i + 1)\n```\n\nAdditionally, it's a good practice to avoid using built-in names like `list` as variable names. I've renamed the list to `my_list` to avoid any potential conflicts."
