        "content": "The \"403: Forbidden\" and \"401 Client Error: Unauthorized\" errors you're encountering when using `python-social-auth` with Django to connect to Google via OAuth2 could be due to several reasons. Here are some steps you can follow to troubleshoot and resolve these issues:\n\n1. **Check Google API Credentials:**\n   - Ensure that the Client ID and Client Secret you are using are correct and correspond to the project in your Google Cloud Console.\n   - Verify that your OAuth 2.0 credentials are enabled and the status is active.\n\n2. **Redirect URI Configuration:**\n   - Make sure that the redirect URI configured in your Google Developer Console matches exactly with what is being used in your Django application. Any mismatch can result in authorization errors.\n   - The redirect URI should be registered in the Google API Console under your OAuth 2.0 credentials.\n\n3. **Permissions and Scopes:**\n   - Ensure that the scopes you are requesting are correctly set and match permissions granted by the user. If you're requesting more permissions than the user grants, it could result in a 403 error.\n   - Double-check if there are any deprecated scopes that need updating.\n\n4. **Refresh Tokens:**\n   - If you are using refresh tokens, ensure that they are being stored and used correctly. Expired or revoked tokens can cause a 401 error.\n   - Check if the token has expired and if so, request a new token using the refresh token.\n\n5. **Verify OAuth2 Setup in Django:**\n   - Make sure that your Django settings are correct and include all the necessary configurations for `python-social-auth`.\n   - Verify that you have included the necessary middleware and context processors in your settings.\n\n6. **Update Libraries:**\n   - Ensure that your `python-social-auth` and any related libraries are up-to-date. Sometimes, updating to the latest version can resolve compatibility issues.\n\n7. **Check Google API Console for Errors:**\n   - Visit the Google API Console and check for any error messages or warnings related to your application.\n   - Look for any quotas that might be exceeded or any restrictions that might be causing the errors.\n\n8. **Server Time Synchronization:**\n   - OAuth2 relies on accurate server time. Ensure that your server's time is synchronized correctly, as time discrepancies can lead to token validation errors.\n\n9. **Error Logging:**\n   - Enable detailed logging for OAuth transactions to get more insights into what might be causing the issue. These logs can provide additional context for debugging.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the underlying issues causing the 403 and 401 errors in your Django application using `python-social-auth` with Google OAuth2."
