You can generate a table of all prime numbers between 1 and 100 in MATLAB, display their factors, and calculate the sum of those factors using the following script:\n\n```matlab\n% Define the range\nstartNum = 1;\nendNum = 100;\n\n% Find all prime numbers in the defined range\nprimeNumbers = primes(endNum);\n\n% Initialize a cell array to store the factors and their sums\nfactorsAndSums = cell(length(primeNumbers), 2);\n\n% Loop over each prime number\nfor i = 1:length(primeNumbers)\n    prime = primeNumbers(i);\n    \n    % Calculate the factors of the prime number\n    factors = 1:prime; % Factors range from 1 to the number itself\n    factors = factors(mod(prime, factors) == 0); % Only keep the factors\n    \n    % Calculate the sum of factors\n    sumOfFactors = sum(factors);\n    \n    % Store the factors and their sum in the cell array\n    factorsAndSums{i, 1} = factors;\n    factorsAndSums{i, 2} = sumOfFactors;\nend\n\n% Display the prime numbers, their factors, and the sum of factors\ndisp('Prime Number | Factors | Sum of Factors');\ndisp('----------------------------------------');\nfor i = 1:length(primeNumbers)\n    fprintf('%12d | %s | %d\\n', primeNumbers(i), mat2str(factorsAndSums{i, 1}), factorsAndSums{i, 2});\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`primes(endNum)`**: This function generates all prime numbers up to `endNum`.\n- **Factors Calculation**: For each prime number, the script calculates its factors by checking divisibility.\n- **Sum of Factors**: The sum of the factors for each prime number is calculated and stored.\n- **Display**: The script prints out each prime number, its factors, and the sum of those factors in a formatted table.\n\nRun this script in MATLAB, and you will get a table of all prime numbers between 1 and 100, along with their factors and the sum of those factors."
