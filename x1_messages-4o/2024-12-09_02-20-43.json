        "content": "To retrieve unique values and their corresponding frequency from a list in Python without looping through the list twice, you can use the `collections.Counter` from the Python standard library. This object is specifically designed to count hashable objects and provides a straightforward way to get the frequency of each element in a list. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Sample list\nelements = ['a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'b']\n\n# Use Counter to get frequencies\nfrequency = Counter(elements)\n\n# Convert frequency dictionary to list of tuples\nresult = list(frequency.items())\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n\n```\n[('a', 2), ('b', 3)]\n```\n\nThe `Counter` class efficiently counts the occurrences of each element in the list in one pass, and the `items()` method returns a list of tuples, each containing an element and its frequency. This approach is efficient and concise."
