Does this indicate that I am using a version of TensorFlow with limited features? Are there any potential side effects?"

        "content": "The message you are seeing is actually informative and not indicative of any issue with your TensorFlow installation. Here's a breakdown of what it means:\n\n1. **oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN)**: TensorFlow uses oneDNN (formerly known as MKL-DNN) to optimize performance on Intel CPUs. This library provides highly optimized implementations of various deep learning operations.\n\n2. **AVX and AVX2 Instructions**: AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions) and AVX2 are sets of instructions that can significantly speed up numerical computations on CPUs. TensorFlow is informing you that it is capable of using these instructions for better performance on supported hardware.\n\n3. **Performance-Critical Operations**: The message specifies that these optimizations are applied to performance-critical operations, which means TensorFlow will make use of these instructions where it matters most for speed.\n\n4. **Rebuilding TensorFlow**: The note about rebuilding TensorFlow with appropriate compiler flags is only relevant if you want to customize or further optimize TensorFlow for your specific hardware beyond the standard optimizations provided. For most users, the pre-built binaries are sufficient.\n\nIn summary, this message indicates that your TensorFlow installation is optimized to take advantage of your CPU's capabilities, and it is not a sign of any limitation or problem. There are no negative side effects, and you can proceed with using TensorFlow as intended. If you need even more performance and you're comfortable building from source, you could explore custom builds, but it's generally not necessary for typical use cases."
