Specifically, I want to analyze the frequency of certain words and phrases throughout the play using code like this:\nvar text = \"To be, or not to be, that is the question\";\nvar words = text.split(\" \");\nvar freq = {};\nfor (var i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {\n  var word = words[i];\n  if (freq[word]) {\n    freq[word]++;\n  } else {\n    freq[word] = 1;\n  }\n}\nconsole.log(freq); // {To: 1, be,: 2, or: 1, not: 1, to: 1, be,: 1, that: 1, is: 1, the: 1, question: 1}"

        "content": "To analyze the language used in Shakespeare's play \"Hamlet\" using JavaScript, you can follow these steps to count the frequency of words and phrases. Since you're already familiar with basic frequency counting, I'll guide you through refining and expanding your existing code.\n\n1. **Preprocess the Text**: Clean the text to remove punctuation, convert to lowercase for uniformity, and handle special characters.\n\n2. **Tokenize the Text**: Split the text into words or phrases depending on your analysis needs.\n\n3. **Count Frequency**: Use an object to store and count each word or phrase's frequency.\n\nHere's a more comprehensive approach using your existing structure and preparing it for a larger text like \"Hamlet\":\n\n```javascript\n// Sample text from \"Hamlet\" (use the full play text for actual analysis)\nvar text = `To be, or not to be, that is the question:\nWhether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer\nThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,\nOr to take arms against a sea of troubles\nAnd by opposing end them.`;\n\n// Function to clean and process the text\nfunction preprocessText(inputText) {\n  return inputText\n    .replace(/[.,\\/#!$%\\^&\\*;:{}=\\-_`~()]/g, \"\") // Remove punctuation\n    .replace(/\\s{2,}/g, \" \") // Replace multiple spaces with a single space\n    .toLowerCase(); // Convert to lowercase\n}\n\n// Preprocess the text\nvar cleanText = preprocessText(text);\n\n// Split the text into words\nvar words = cleanText.split(\" \");\n\n// Initialize an object to hold word frequencies\nvar freq = {};\n\n// Count the frequency of each word\nfor (var i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {\n  var word = words[i];\n  if (freq[word]) {\n    freq[word]++;\n  } else {\n    freq[word] = 1;\n  }\n}\n\nconsole.log(freq);\n```\n\n### Tips for Further Analysis:\n\n1. **Handling Phrases**: If you want to analyze phrases, you can modify the splitting logic to consider n-grams (e.g., pairs of words) instead of single words.\n\n2. **Stemming and Lemmatization**: Consider implementing stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their root forms (e.g., \"running\" to \"run\").\n\n3. **Stop Words**: You might want to filter out common stop words like \"the\", \"is\", \"and\", etc., which might not be meaningful for your analysis.\n\n4. **Visualizing Data**: Use libraries like Chart.js or D3.js to visualize word frequency data.\n\nBy expanding upon this basic structure, you can perform detailed textual analysis on \"Hamlet\" or any other text."
