This difference will be the greatest difference between any two numbers in the array.\n\nHere is a simple algorithm you can follow, along with a Python implementation:\n\n### Algorithm:\n1. Initialize two variables, `max_value` and `min_value`, with the first element of the array.\n2. Loop through each element in the array:\n   - If the current element is greater than `max_value`, update `max_value`.\n   - If the current element is less than `min_value`, update `min_value`.\n3. The greatest difference will be `max_value - min_value`.\n\n### Python Implementation:\n```python\ndef greatest_difference(arr):\n    if not arr:\n        return 0  # If the array is empty, return 0 or handle accordingly.\n\n    max_value = arr[0]\n    min_value = arr[0]\n\n    for num in arr:\n        if num > max_value:\n            max_value = num\n        if num < min_value:\n            min_value = num\n\n    return max_value - min_value\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [3, 10, 6, 1, 15]\ndifference = greatest_difference(arr)\nprint(\"The greatest difference is:\", difference)\n```\n\nThis code will output the greatest difference between any two numbers in the array. In the example provided, the greatest difference is `15 - 1 = 14`."
