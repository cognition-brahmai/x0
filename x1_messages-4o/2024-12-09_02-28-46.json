A user can only be in one of these objects. I tried the following code:\n\n{% if user.username in req.accepted.all or req.declined.all %}\n\nBut if user.username is in req.accepted.all then it escapes the conditional. However, if it's in req.declined.all then it follows the condition. What am I missing here?"

        "content": "To implement an XOR (exclusive or) logic in a Django template, you need to ensure that only one of the conditions is true. However, Django's template language is quite limited in terms of logical operations, and it doesn't support XOR directly. \n\nThe issue in your current code is that the `or` operator checks if either condition is true, without considering exclusivity. Here\u2019s a workaround to achieve XOR logic using Django template filters and tags:\n\n1. **Use a Custom Template Filter**: You can create a custom template filter to perform the XOR operation.\n\nFirst, create a custom template filter in one of your app's `templatetags` directories:\n\n```python\n# myapp/templatetags/custom_filters.py\n\nfrom django import template\n\nregister = template.Library()\n\n@register.filter\ndef xor(value1, value2):\n    return bool(value1) ^ bool(value2)\n```\n\nThen, load the filter in your template and use it as follows:\n\n```html\n{% load custom_filters %}\n\n{% if user.username in req.accepted.all|xor:user.username in req.declined.all %}\n    <!-- User is in one of the lists, but not both -->\n    User is present in one list exclusively.\n{% else %}\n    <!-- User is either not in any list or in both (which shouldn't happen) -->\n    User is not present exclusively in one list.\n{% endif %}\n```\n\n2. **Modify Logic in View**: Instead of handling XOR logic in a template, do it in your view and pass a boolean to the template.\n\nIn your view, calculate whether the user is in exactly one of the lists:\n\n```python\n# views.py\n\ndef your_view(request):\n    user_in_accepted = user.username in req.accepted.all()\n    user_in_declined = user.username in req.declined.all()\n    \n    user_in_exclusive_list = user_in_accepted ^ user_in_declined\n    \n    return render(request, 'your_template.html', {\n        'user_in_exclusive_list': user_in_exclusive_list,\n        # other context variables\n    })\n```\n\nThen, in your template, you can simply check:\n\n```html\n{% if user_in_exclusive_list %}\n    User is present in one list exclusively.\n{% else %}\n    User is not present exclusively in one list.\n{% endif %}\n```\n\nThis approach simplifies the logic in the template and is often more maintainable."
