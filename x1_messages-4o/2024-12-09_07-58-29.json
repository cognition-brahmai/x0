        "content": "I am studying the multiprocessing module of Python and have come across an issue while seeding random number generators in parallel programs. I have two cases:\n\n1. In the first case, I have a function 'Foo' that generates a random number within the range of 0 and 1 for a given number of iterations. This function is then mapped to a multiprocessing pool. Here's the relevant code:\n```python\ndef Foo(nbr_iter):\n    for step in xrange(int(nbr_iter)) :\n        print random.uniform(0,1)\n...\n\nfrom multiprocessing import Pool\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    ...\n    pool = Pool(processes=nmr_parallel_block)\n    pool.map(Foo, nbr_trial_per_process)\n```\n2. In the second case, I am using numpy and doing a similar task of generating random numbers. However, I seed the random number generator explicitly. Here's the code:\n```python\n def Foo_np(nbr_iter):\n     np.random.seed()\n     print np.random.uniform(0,1,nbr_iter)\n```\nIn both cases, the random number generators are seeded in their forked processes. My question is, why do I have to do the seeding explicitly in the numpy example, but not in the Python example?"

        "content": "The difference in behavior you are observing between the two cases is related to how the random number generators are initialized and used in Python's `random` module versus NumPy's `random` module, especially in the context of multiprocessing.\n\n1. **Python's `random` module:**\n   - When you use the `random` module in Python, it is automatically seeded when the module is imported. In the multiprocessing context, when a process is forked, it inherits the state of the random number generator from the parent process. This means that if you do not explicitly seed the random number generator in each child process, they all start with the same state, leading to the generation of the same sequence of random numbers in each process.\n   - In your first example, since you did not explicitly seed the random number generator within the function `Foo`, each child process starts with a different state due to the forking mechanism. However, if you want to ensure independent random sequences, it is generally good practice to seed each process's random number generator explicitly.\n\n2. **NumPy's `random` module:**\n   - NumPy's random number generator works similarly, but it is often more explicit about seeding due to its wide use in scientific computations where reproducibility is crucial.\n   - In your second example, you are explicitly calling `np.random.seed()` within `Foo_np`. The `np.random.seed()` function seeds the random number generator in each subprocess, ensuring that each process starts with a different state, which is essential for producing independent random sequences in parallel computations.\n   - Without this explicit seeding, NumPy's random number generator in each forked process would also inherit the same state from the parent, leading to the same sequence of numbers being generated.\n\nIn conclusion, while forking generally leads to inheriting the state of the random number generator, explicit seeding is a good practice when working with parallel processes to ensure that each process generates independent random sequences. This is especially important in scientific computing with NumPy, where control over randomness and reproducibility is often needed."
