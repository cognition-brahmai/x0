        "content": "In Python, you can obtain the name of a class as a string using the `__name__` attribute of the class. Here's a simple example to demonstrate how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n    pass\n\n# Get the name of the class\nclass_name = MyClass.__name__\n\nprint(class_name)  # Output: MyClass\n```\n\nIn this example, `MyClass.__name__` retrieves the name of the class `MyClass` as a string.\n\nIf you have an instance of the class and want to get the class name, you can use the `__class__` attribute of the instance:\n\n```python\n# Create an instance of the class\nmy_instance = MyClass()\n\n# Get the name of the class from the instance\nclass_name_from_instance = my_instance.__class__.__name__\n\nprint(class_name_from_instance)  # Output: MyClass\n```\n\nThis will give you the class name from the instance of the class. Both approaches are straightforward and commonly used in Python to retrieve class names."
