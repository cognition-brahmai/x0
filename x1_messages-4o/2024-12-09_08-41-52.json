I have written some code to export the mesh, bone structure, and animations, and I'm able to animate a simple skeleton. However, when I attempt to animate more than one bone, an issue arises where the arm moves in the incorrect axis. I suspect this issue might be related to the bone roll in Blender. I am using Blender version 2.56.3. Here is my C++ code and Python export code:\n\nC++ Code: http://kyuu.co.uk/so/main.cpp\nPython Export Code: http://kyuu.co.uk/so/test.py\n\nThe relevant part of my C++ code is as follows:\n\n```cpp\nclass bone {\n    bone * child;\n    Eigen::Matrix4f local_bind_pose; // this i read from a file\n    Eigen::Matrix4f final_skinning_matrix; // i then transform each vertex by this matrix\n\n    // temporary variables\n    Eigen::Matrix4f inv_bind_pose;\n    Eigen::Matrix4f world_bind_pose;\n}\n```\n\nI'm calculating the `inv_bind_pose` as such:\n\n```cpp\nworld_bind_pose = bone.parent.world_bind_pose * local_bind_pose\ninv_bind_pose = world_bind_pose.inverse()\n```\n\nI understand that the `bind_pose` must be relative to the parent bone, and that Blender uses z = up while I'm using y = up. However, I'm having difficulty exporting this information from Blender. \n\nIn terms of the rotation part of the matrix, would this be `bone.matrix_local`? And would the translation part be `bone.tail() - bone.head()`? Also, how does bone roll affect the result? Can someone help me understand what I'm doing wrong?"

        "content": "It sounds like you're dealing with the complexities of coordinate system transformations and bone hierarchies, which are common issues when exporting data from Blender to use in OpenGL or other rendering engines. Let's go through the steps to ensure everything is set up correctly and address the potential issues you might be facing.\n\n1. **Coordinate System Differences**: As you've noted, Blender uses a Z-up coordinate system, while many other systems, including typical OpenGL setups, use Y-up. To address this:\n\n   - When exporting, you'll need to apply a conversion to account for this difference. You can do this by applying a rotation matrix that converts Z-up to Y-up, usually a 90-degree rotation around the X-axis.\n\n2. **Bone Transformations**: Bones in Blender have a local transformation matrix (`matrix_local`) that includes the rotation, translation, and scale relative to their parent bone. When exporting:\n\n   - The `matrix_local` should be used to determine the bone's transformation relative to its parent.\n   - The translation part is not simply `bone.tail() - bone.head()`. Instead, you should use the translation component of the `matrix_local`.\n\n3. **Bone Roll**: Bone roll can significantly affect how the bone's local axes are aligned. In Blender, the roll value influences the orientation of the bone's local coordinate system.\n\n   - Make sure to account for the bone roll when exporting. This might involve adjusting the rotation component of the transformation matrix accordingly.\n\n4. **Exporting the Correct Matrix**: When exporting, you need to ensure that the transformation matrices are correctly converted to your target coordinate system.\n\n   - For each bone, compute the world transformation by multiplying its local transformation with its parent's world transformation.\n   - Then, calculate the inverse bind pose matrix as you have done, which looks correct given the context.\n\n5. **Debugging Tips**:\n   - Visualize the exported data in Blender or another tool to ensure that the exported transformations make sense.\n   - Check each bone's orientation and position in both Blender and your OpenGL setup to confirm they match after accounting for coordinate system differences.\n\nTo address your specific questions:\n\n- **Rotation Part**: Yes, `bone.matrix_local` is usually what you'd export for the rotation part.\n\n- **Translation Part**: Use the translation part of `matrix_local`, not `bone.tail() - bone.head()` directly.\n\n- **Python Export Code**: Without seeing the details of your Python export code, ensure that the matrix conversion and coordinate system adjustments are handled correctly there.\n\nIf you'd like more specific advice on your code, please provide access to the C++ and Python code snippets, and I can help you pinpoint any issues."
