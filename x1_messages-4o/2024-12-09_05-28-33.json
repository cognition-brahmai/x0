The dictionary looks like this: \n\n```python\ndata = {\"id\": str(album.id), \"title\": album.title}\n```\n\nHowever, the output I get from `json.dumps(data)` differs from what I get from `flask.jsonify(data)`. \n\n```python\njson.dumps(data): [{\"id\": \"4ea856fd6506ae0db42702dd\", \"title\": \"Business\"}]\nflask.jsonify(data): {\"id\":\u2026, \"title\":\u2026}\n```\n\nI'm not quite sure why they're different and I need to get a result that looks more like what `json.dumps` returns. Can anyone explain the difference and how to achieve the desired output?"

        "content": "The difference you're observing between `json.dumps(data)` and `flask.jsonify(data)` output is due to the way these functions handle JSON serialization in Python.\n\n1. **`json.dumps(data)`**:\n   - `json.dumps` is a function from Python's standard library `json` module. It serializes a Python object (like a dictionary) into a JSON-formatted string. \n   - The output is a string representation of your dictionary, complete with escaped characters if necessary.\n   - It does not handle HTTP responses or set any HTTP headers.\n\n2. **`flask.jsonify(data)`**:\n   - `flask.jsonify` is a Flask-specific function that creates a `Response` object with the JSON representation of the given data. It's specifically designed for creating JSON responses for a web API.\n   - It automatically sets the `Content-Type` of the response to `application/json`, which is important for web clients to properly interpret the data.\n   - When you see output like `{\"id\":\u2026, \"title\":\u2026}`, it might be because you're examining the response object directly, rather than its data. Flask's debugging console or some IDEs might not display the full content of a response object in raw form, but rather show a preview.\n\nTo achieve a result that looks more like `json.dumps`, you need to ensure you're extracting the JSON data from the `flask.jsonify` response properly. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import jsonify\n\n# Assuming you're within a Flask route or context\nresponse = jsonify(data)\njson_data = response.get_json()  # Extract the JSON data as a Python dictionary\nprint(json_data)\n```\n\nIf you specifically need to return the JSON as a string (like `json.dumps`), you can convert it back:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import jsonify\nimport json\n\n# Assuming you're within a Flask route or context\nresponse = jsonify(data)\njson_string = json.dumps(response.get_json())  # Convert back to a JSON string\nprint(json_string)\n```\n\nThis way, `json_string` will give you a JSON-formatted string similar to what `json.dumps(data)` would produce. However, remember that in a Flask application, `jsonify` is often preferred for returning JSON responses because it handles headers and mimetypes appropriately for web communication."
