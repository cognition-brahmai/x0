I've created a small library to interact with iTunes and I'd like to have a `DOWNLOAD_FOLDER_PATH` module variable. iTunes doesn't provide the location of its download folder, so I've created a function that identifies the filepath of some podcast tracks and moves up the directory tree until it discovers the \"Downloads\" directory. This process takes a couple of seconds, and I'd prefer it to be evaluated lazily, rather than at the time of module import. Can I lazily assign a module variable when it's first accessed or do I have to use a function?"

        "content": "Yes, you can lazily load a module-level variable in Python by using a combination of properties and a private variable to cache the result. This allows the variable to be evaluated only when it is first accessed, and then cached for future use. Here's an example of how you can implement this:\n\n```python\n# your_module.py\n\nimport os\n\n# Private variable to cache the result\n_download_folder_path = None\n\ndef _find_download_folder():\n    # This function contains your logic to find the download folder\n    # For demonstration purposes, let's assume it returns a path\n    # Replace this with your actual logic\n    path = \"/path/to/Downloads\"\n    return path\n\n@property\ndef DOWNLOAD_FOLDER_PATH():\n    global _download_folder_path\n    if _download_folder_path is None:\n        _download_folder_path = _find_download_folder()\n    return _download_folder_path\n```\n\nIn this setup, `DOWNLOAD_FOLDER_PATH` is defined as a property. When you access `DOWNLOAD_FOLDER_PATH`, it checks if the `_download_folder_path` variable is `None`. If it is, it calculates the path using `_find_download_folder()` and stores the result in `_download_folder_path`. Subsequent accesses to `DOWNLOAD_FOLDER_PATH` will return the cached result, avoiding the need to recalculate the path.\n\nHere's how you would use it in your code:\n\n```python\nimport your_module\n\n# The download folder path will be calculated and cached on first access\nprint(your_module.DOWNLOAD_FOLDER_PATH)\n```\n\nThis method ensures that the potentially time-consuming operation of finding the download folder is only done once, the first time it's needed."
