I have generated the application using `endpoints.api_server([TestEndpoint], restricted=False)` and am using WebTest in the following manner: `client = webtest.TestApp(application)` and `client.post('/_ah/api/test/v1/test', params)`. However, despite testing with curl working fine, I am unsure if endpoints is compatible with WebTest or if I should write tests for endpoints differently. Can you provide any suggestions from the Google App Engine Endpoints team?"

        "content": "When setting up unit tests for Google Cloud Endpoints using WebTest, encountering an `AppError: 404 Not Found` often indicates that the URL being used in the test request does not match the endpoint's expected URL or that the application is not properly initialized. Here are some suggestions to help you resolve the issue and correctly set up your unit tests:\n\n1. **Verify Endpoint URL**: Double-check the URL path you are using in your test (`/_ah/api/test/v1/test`) to ensure it matches exactly with the expected path of your API endpoint. The path should include the API root, version, and method name as defined in your endpoint class.\n\n2. **Check API Server Initialization**: Ensure that the `endpoints.api_server()` function is correctly initialized with the appropriate API classes. It should look something like this:\n\n   ```python\n   from google.appengine.api import endpoints\n\n   application = endpoints.api_server([TestEndpoint], restricted=False)\n   ```\n\n3. **Correct HTTP Method**: Make sure that the HTTP method (`client.post`) matches the method defined in your endpoint. If your endpoint expects a `GET` request, ensure that you are using `client.get` instead of `client.post`.\n\n4. **WebTest Setup**: Ensure the `TestApp` is initialized with the correct WSGI application object. If `application` is not the correct WSGI app, the requests might not be routed properly.\n\n5. **Testing Configuration**: Sometimes, settings or configurations used during testing might differ from those used in production. Ensure that any environment variables or configurations are correctly set up for the testing environment.\n\n6. **Logging**: Add logging to your endpoint methods to help trace the execution flow and identify where requests might be failing. This can provide insights into whether the endpoint is being hit at all and what might be going wrong.\n\n7. **Check for Errors in Endpoint Definitions**: Ensure that your API methods are decorated properly with `@endpoints.method` and that the request and response message classes are correctly defined.\n\n8. **Test with Local Development Server**: Run your application locally using the Google Cloud SDK's development server to ensure that the endpoints are accessible and functioning as expected outside of the test environment.\n\n9. **Review Documentation**: Go through the [Google Cloud Endpoints documentation](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/openapi/get-started-app-engine) to ensure that all configurations and setups are correct.\n\nIf you've verified all the above and the issue persists, consider isolating the problem by creating a minimal example with a simple endpoint and a corresponding test case to see if the problem is with the setup or a specific part of your application. This can help narrow down the cause of the 404 error."
