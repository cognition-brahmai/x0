The string must always be five characters long, with any empty spaces filled with zeroes. For example, if the integer is 1, the formatted string should be '00001'. Similarly, if the integer is 110, the formatted string should be '00110'. How can I achieve this in Python?"

        "content": "To format an integer into a fixed-length string with leading zeroes in Python, you can use the `zfill` method or string formatting methods like `str.format()` or f-strings. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using `zfill`:**\n\n   The `zfill` method is a straightforward way to pad a string with leading zeroes. Here's an example:\n\n   ```python\n   number = 110\n   formatted_number = str(number).zfill(5)\n   print(formatted_number)  # Output: '00110'\n   ```\n\n2. **Using `str.format()`:**\n\n   The `str.format()` method allows you to specify the width and fill character. Here's how you can use it:\n\n   ```python\n   number = 110\n   formatted_number = \"{:05}\".format(number)\n   print(formatted_number)  # Output: '00110'\n   ```\n\n3. **Using f-strings (Python 3.6+):**\n\n   f-strings provide a concise way to format strings. You can specify the width and fill character directly in the f-string:\n\n   ```python\n   number = 110\n   formatted_number = f\"{number:05}\"\n   print(formatted_number)  # Output: '00110'\n   ```\n\nAny of these methods will help you achieve the desired formatting for your integer. Choose the one that best fits your style or the version of Python you are using."
