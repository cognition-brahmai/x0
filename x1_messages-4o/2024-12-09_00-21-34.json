I've been using the default dictionary three levels deep, which works fine but is quite memory-intensive. I believe there is more memory overhead due to the creation of more dictionary slots than actually used. I want to replace the dictionaries with something more memory efficient, but still allows key lookups. I'd prefer using standard Python libraries, but I'm open to other alternatives. I've tried using tuples but it didn't make much difference. For context, I'm using the dataset from the most recent version of Wikipedia For Schools. When parsing the first thousand pages, the text file with the three words and count tab-separated is around 11MB. However, storing the text in the current dictionary format I'm using takes about 185MB. Can you suggest a more memory-efficient alternative?"

        "content": "To optimize memory usage for storing and analyzing word triplets, you can consider several strategies that balance memory efficiency and performance. Here are some approaches:\n\n1. **Use `collections.Counter` with Tuples**: While tuples themselves didn't make much difference in your initial attempts, using them in combination with `collections.Counter` can be more efficient than nested dictionaries. `Counter` is optimized for counting hashable objects and reduces the overhead compared to dictionaries.\n\n   ```python\n   from collections import Counter\n\n   triplet_counter = Counter()\n\n   # Example of adding triplets\n   triplet_counter[('word1', 'word2', 'word3')] += 1\n   ```\n\n2. **Use `defaultdict` with a single dictionary**: Instead of nesting multiple dictionaries, you can use a flat dictionary with tuples as keys. This reduces the number of objects created compared to a deeply nested structure.\n\n   ```python\n   from collections import defaultdict\n\n   triplet_dict = defaultdict(int)\n\n   # Example of adding triplets\n   triplet_dict[('word1', 'word2', 'word3')] += 1\n   ```\n\n3. **Consider `numpy` for Fixed-size Arrays**: If your word triplets can be represented as integers (e.g., indices or hashes), you can use `numpy` arrays for more compact storage. This approach requires mapping words to unique integers, which can significantly reduce memory usage.\n\n   ```python\n   import numpy as np\n\n   # Assuming word_to_id is a dictionary mapping words to unique integers\n   triplets = np.zeros((num_unique_words, num_unique_words, num_unique_words), dtype=int)\n\n   # Increment count for a triplet\n   triplets[word_to_id['word1'], word_to_id['word2'], word_to_id['word3']] += 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Use `dataclasses` and `__slots__`**: If you need to store additional information or metadata with each triplet, using `dataclasses` with `__slots__` can reduce memory overhead.\n\n   ```python\n   from dataclasses import dataclass\n\n   @dataclass\n   class Triplet:\n       __slots__ = ('first', 'second', 'third', 'count')\n       first: str\n       second: str\n       third: str\n       count: int = 0\n\n   # Example of using the Triplet class\n   triplet = Triplet('word1', 'word2', 'word3')\n   triplet.count += 1\n   ```\n\n5. **External Tools for Compression**: If you're open to using tools beyond standard Python libraries, consider libraries like `sqlite3` to store triplets in a compact disk-based database, or `blosc` for in-memory compression.\n\n6. **Efficient String Storage**: Consider using a string interning approach or libraries like `pystring` to reduce memory usage when storing repeated strings.\n\nBy using these methods, you can effectively reduce the memory footprint of your word triplet analysis while maintaining the ability to perform efficient key lookups."
