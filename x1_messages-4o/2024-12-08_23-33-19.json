        "content": "The idiom \"heart and soul\" is deeply rooted in the cultural lexicon, often used to express total commitment, passion, or dedication to a task, cause, or relationship. Its origins can be traced back to the importance of the heart and soul in ancient philosophies and religions, where the heart is seen as the seat of emotion and the soul as the essence of a person's being.\n\n### Historical and Cultural Significance:\n1. **Ancient Philosophies**: In many ancient cultures, the heart was considered the center of human emotion and morality, while the soul represented a person's spiritual essence. This duality contributed to the idiom's meaning of complete and wholehearted involvement.\n\n2. **Religious Contexts**: In religious texts, giving one's \"heart and soul\" to a deity or cause often implies a deep spiritual and emotional commitment. For example, in the Bible, the phrase is used to describe the level of devotion expected by God.\n\n3. **Romantic and Literary Contexts**: In literature and music, the phrase is commonly used to describe profound love or dedication to an art form, emphasizing the depth of feeling and personal investment involved.\n\n### Examples in Literary and Artistic Works:\n- **Literature**: In classic literature, characters often pledge their \"heart and soul\" to their beloved or to a cause, highlighting the depth of their passion and commitment.\n  \n- **Music**: The phrase appears in numerous song lyrics, often conveying themes of love, dedication, and passion. For example, the 1938 jazz standard \"Heart and Soul\" by Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser uses the phrase to express romantic longing and connection.\n\n- **Art**: Artists might describe putting their \"heart and soul\" into their creations, suggesting a deep personal investment in their work.\n\n### Ruby Code Example:\n\nTo find instances of \"heart and soul\" in literary and artistic works, you might use a script like this to search a database or text file:\n\n```ruby\ndef heart_and_soul_usage\n  works = [\n    \"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen\",\n    \"Heart and Soul by Hoagy Carmichael\",\n    \"The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway\",\n    # Add more works to the list\n  ]\n\n  instances = works.select do |work|\n    work.downcase.include?(\"heart and soul\")\n  end\n\n  instances.each do |instance|\n    puts \"Found usage in: #{instance}\"\n  end\nend\n\nheart_and_soul_usage\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, you would replace the `works` array with a collection of texts or titles that you wish to search through. The script checks each work for the presence of the phrase \"heart and soul,\" and prints out the titles where it is found."
