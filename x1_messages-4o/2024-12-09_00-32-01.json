Could someone explain why this is happening?"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is due to how Python's generator expressions work with variable bindings. When you create a generator expression, it captures the variable `array` by reference, not by value. This means that the generator will use the latest value of `array` at the time of iteration, not at the time of the generator's creation.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of what's happening in your code:\n\n1. You first assign `[1, 8, 15]` to `array`.\n2. You create a generator expression `g = (x for x in array if array.count(x) > 0)`. At this point, `g` is set up to iterate over the current `array`, but it doesn't actually iterate yet.\n3. You then reassign `array` to `[2, 8, 22]`.\n4. When you convert the generator `g` to a list with `list(g)`, the generator starts iterating over `array`. Now `array` is `[2, 8, 22]`.\n5. The generator checks each element in `[2, 8, 22]`. For each element `x`, it evaluates `if array.count(x) > 0`, which is true for `8`, because `8` appears once in the new `array`.\n\nThat's why you get `[8]` as the output: it's the only number from the original `array` that is also in the new `array` when the generator iterates.\n\nIf you want the generator to work with the original array, you should capture its value at the time of the generator's creation. You can do this by using a default argument in a lambda or by making a copy of the list:\n\n```python\narray = [1, 8, 15]\ng = (x for x in array[:] if array.count(x) > 0)  # Using a slice to copy the list\narray = [2, 8, 22]\nprint(list(g))  # This will now output [1, 8, 15]\n```\n\nBy using `array[:]`, you create a shallow copy of the list and bind the generator to this copy. Thus, changes to `array` after the generator's creation do not affect the generator."
