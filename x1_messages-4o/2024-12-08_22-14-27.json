Since the sentence is not provided, we can only deduce based on the definitions given. \n\n- \"Beach\" refers to a sandy shore.\n- \"June\" refers to the sixth month of the year.\n- \"Astronomical object\" refers to an object in the sky.\n\nWithout a specific sentence, any of these could be a potential answer depending on the context. However, if you have a specific sentence or context in mind, please provide it, and I'll be able to determine the most fitting answer."
