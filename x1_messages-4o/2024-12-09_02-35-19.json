        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the format of your JSON file. Spark expects JSON files to be in a specific format, typically a JSON Lines format where each line is a separate JSON object. In your case, the JSON file is formatted as a single JSON object, which isn't directly compatible with the way Spark reads JSON files.\n\nTo solve this problem, you need to convert your JSON file into a format that Spark can understand. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Modify the JSON File**: Change the file to use JSON Lines format, where each line is a separate, complete JSON object. For your example, the file should look like:\n\n    ```\n    {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}\n    ```\n\n   Ensure there are no other lines or objects in the file unless each is a separate JSON object.\n\n2. **Read the Updated JSON File**: Use your existing code to read this updated JSON file. Spark should now be able to parse it correctly.\n\nHere's your updated code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark import SparkContext\nfrom pyspark.sql import SQLContext\n\nsc = SparkContext()\nsqlc = SQLContext(sc)\ndf = sqlc.read.json('my_file.json')\ndf.show()\n```\n\nBy ensuring each JSON object is on a single line, Spark can correctly interpret each line as a separate record in the DataFrame. This resolves the `_corrupt_record` issue you were encountering."
