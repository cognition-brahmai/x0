I have a code where threads are running an infinite while loop and they can stall for a random, large amount of time. I want the threads to not last longer than the time set by a certain 'duration' variable. Here is my current code:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    t1 = threading.Thread(target=thread1, args=1)\n    t2 = threading.Thread(target=thread2, args=2)\n\n    time.sleep(duration)\n    #the threads must be terminated after this sleep\n```\nI want to make it so after the length set by duration, the threads stop. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To terminate threads after a certain duration in Python, you can use a combination of threading and event flags. Python threads cannot be forcefully killed, but you can design your threads to periodically check for a termination signal and exit gracefully if they detect it. Here\u2019s how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport threading\nimport time\n\n# Create an event object for signaling the threads to stop\nstop_event = threading.Event()\n\ndef thread1(arg):\n    while not stop_event.is_set():\n        # Simulate work with a print statement and sleep\n        print(f\"Thread 1 is running with argument {arg}\")\n        time.sleep(1)\n\ndef thread2(arg):\n    while not stop_event.is_set():\n        # Simulate work with a print statement and sleep\n        print(f\"Thread 2 is running with argument {arg}\")\n        time.sleep(1)\n\ndef main():\n    duration = 5  # Set your desired duration in seconds\n\n    # Create threads\n    t1 = threading.Thread(target=thread1, args=(1,))\n    t2 = threading.Thread(target=thread2, args=(2,))\n\n    # Start threads\n    t1.start()\n    t2.start()\n\n    # Wait for the specified duration\n    time.sleep(duration)\n\n    # Signal the threads to stop\n    stop_event.set()\n\n    # Join the threads to wait for them to finish\n    t1.join()\n    t2.join()\n\n    print(\"Threads have been terminated after duration.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Event Object**: We use the `threading.Event()` object to signal threads to stop. The threads periodically check if this event is set using `stop_event.is_set()`.\n\n2. **Graceful Exit**: Inside each thread function, you keep running the loop as long as `stop_event.is_set()` returns `False`. Once the event is set, the thread exits the loop and finishes execution.\n\n3. **Joining Threads**: After setting the event, we `join` the threads to ensure that the main program waits for them to finish before proceeding.\n\nThis approach ensures that threads are terminated in a controlled and safe manner after the specified duration."
