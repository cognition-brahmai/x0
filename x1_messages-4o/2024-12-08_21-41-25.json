For example, if the song has elements of Viking mythology and folk instruments, it might be classified as Viking/folk metal. You can use a library of sub-subgenres to compare the song to, and output the closest match. Don't forget to include a user interface that allows the user to input the song title and artist."

        "content": "Creating a program to analyze a heavy metal song and classify it into a specific sub-subgenre is quite complex, especially when considering elements such as lyrical themes and instrumentation. However, I can guide you on how to approach this task using a combination of C++ and some additional libraries or APIs that can assist in analyzing music and lyrics. Here is a simple outline of how you might structure this program:\n\n### Requirements\n1. **Audio Analysis Library**: Use a library like [librosa](https://librosa.org/) (though primarily Python, you might need to use a compatible C++ library or call Python scripts) for audio feature extraction.\n2. **Lyrics API**: Use an API like [Genius](https://docs.genius.com/) to fetch song lyrics for analysis.\n3. **Genre Database**: Maintain a small database or file with characteristics of various metal sub-subgenres.\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n1. **User Interface**: Create a simple console-based user interface for input.\n2. **Audio Analysis**: Extract features such as tempo, instrumentation, and rhythm.\n3. **Lyrics Analysis**: Fetch and analyze lyrics for thematic elements.\n4. **Genre Matching**: Compare extracted features against your database to determine the closest match.\n5. **Output Result**: Display the sub-subgenre.\n\nHere's an illustrative C++ code for the user interface and basic structure:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n\n// Function prototypes\nvoid analyzeSong(const std::string& songTitle, const std::string& artist);\n\nint main() {\n    std::string songTitle;\n    std::string artist;\n    \n    std::cout << \"Welcome to the Metal Subgenre Analyzer!\" << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Please enter the song title: \";\n    std::getline(std::cin, songTitle);\n    std::cout << \"Please enter the artist: \";\n    std::getline(std::cin, artist);\n\n    analyzeSong(songTitle, artist);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nvoid analyzeSong(const std::string& songTitle, const std::string& artist) {\n    // Placeholder: Implement audio and lyrics analysis\n    // Fetch audio features and lyrics\n    // Compare with subgenre characteristics\n\n    std::cout << \"Analyzing \\\"\" << songTitle << \"\\\" by \" << artist << \"...\" << std::endl;\n\n    // Placeholder for analysis logic\n    // This is where you would perform the actual analysis and classification\n\n    // Example output\n    std::cout << \"The song \\\"\" << songTitle << \"\\\" by \" << artist << \" is classified as Viking/Folk Metal.\" << std::endl;\n}\n```\n\n### Additional Steps\n\n1. **Audio Analysis**: Implement a feature extraction process, possibly using an external library or service.\n2. **Lyrics Analysis**: Use an API to fetch lyrics and analyze them for thematic content.\n3. **Integrate with Database**: Create a database of sub-subgenres with characteristics and match against extracted features.\n\n### Considerations\n\n- Analyzing audio directly in C++ can be challenging without proper libraries.\n- You might need to integrate Python scripts if using libraries like librosa.\n- The accuracy of genre classification depends on the quality of your feature extraction and the comprehensiveness of your genre database.\n\nThis approach provides a basic framework, and you will need to fill in the details with appropriate libraries and logic for feature extraction and analysis."
