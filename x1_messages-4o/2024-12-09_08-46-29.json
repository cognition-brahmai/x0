        "content": "The error you're encountering is a known issue that can occur with older versions of the `pkg_resources` module, which is part of the `setuptools` package. This issue typically arises when there's an incompatibility between the versions of `pip`, `setuptools`, and `pkg_resources`.\n\nHere are steps to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Upgrade `pip`, `setuptools`, and `wheel`:**\n\n   First, try upgrading `pip`, `setuptools`, and `wheel` together to ensure they are compatible with each other. Run the following commands:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel\n   ```\n\n2. **Install a specific version of `setuptools`:**\n\n   Sometimes, upgrading to the latest version of `setuptools` may not work due to compatibility issues with older versions of Python. You can try installing a specific version that is known to work well with Python 3.5.2:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m pip install setuptools==44.1.1\n   ```\n\n3. **Clear the cache:**\n\n   If you still encounter issues, it may help to clear the pip cache:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m pip cache purge\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for system updates:**\n\n   Ensure your system packages are up-to-date, as there may be fixes available through the system package manager:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt update\n   sudo apt upgrade\n   ```\n\n5. **Use a virtual environment:**\n\n   If the above steps don't resolve the problem, consider using a virtual environment. This can help isolate your Python packages from the system environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n   python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel\n   ```\n\n6. **Consider upgrading Python:**\n\n   Ubuntu 16.04 comes with Python 3.5.2, which is quite old. If possible, consider upgrading to a newer version of Python, as many packages have dropped support for Python 3.5. You can install a newer Python version using a PPA:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa\n   sudo apt update\n   sudo apt install python3.8\n   ```\n\n   After installing the newer Python version, you can create a virtual environment with it:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.8 -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `_NamespacePath` object error and successfully install packages using pip3 on your system."
