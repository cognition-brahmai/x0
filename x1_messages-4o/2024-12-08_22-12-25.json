Have you finalized your travel plans for the upcoming holiday?\n\n**Raj:** Hi, Aisha! Yes, I have. I'm planning to visit Kerala. I've always wanted to experience the backwaters and the houseboats. What about you?\n\n**Aisha:** That sounds amazing! I've heard the scenery there is breathtaking. I'm thinking of heading to Rajasthan. I've never been to a desert before, and the palaces there look incredible.\n\n**Raj:** Rajasthan is a great choice! Are you planning to visit Jaipur and Udaipur?\n\n**Aisha:** Definitely! I want to see the City Palace in Jaipur and maybe do a camel safari in Jaisalmer. I\u2019m still figuring out the details. How long are you staying in Kerala?\n\n**Raj:** I'll be there for about a week. Planning to split my time between Kochi, Munnar, and Alleppey. I\u2019m really excited about the tea plantations in Munnar.\n\n**Aisha:** That sounds like a perfect itinerary. Make sure to take a lot of pictures! Maybe we can exchange travel stories once we\u2019re back.\n\n**Raj:** Absolutely! Safe travels, Aisha. Can't wait to hear all about your adventures in Rajasthan!\n\n**Aisha:** Safe travels to you too, Raj! Enjoy the tranquility of Kerala.\n\n---"
