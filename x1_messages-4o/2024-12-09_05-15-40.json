First to connect to host-1, and then from host-1 to host-2, each with different credentials. However, the configuration menu in PyCharm only accepts one SSH tunnel. I would like to know if there is any way to set a multi-hop SSH to have access to the interpreter and data files on the host from local."

        "content": "Configuring PyCharm for a multi-hop SSH setup requires a bit of work because PyCharm's interface directly supports only a single SSH hop. However, you can achieve this by setting up SSH tunneling manually. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n### Step 1: Configure SSH Config for Multi-Hop\n\n1. **Edit your SSH config file**: Open `~/.ssh/config` in a text editor.\n\n2. **Add the multi-hop configuration**: You can create an SSH configuration that allows you to jump from `host-1` to `host-2`.\n\n    ```plaintext\n    Host host-1\n        HostName <ip-of-host-1>\n        User <username-for-host-1>\n        IdentityFile <path-to-private-key-for-host-1>\n\n    Host host-2\n        HostName <ip-of-host-2>\n        User <username-for-host-2>\n        IdentityFile <path-to-private-key-for-host-2>\n        ProxyJump host-1\n    ```\n\n   - Replace `<ip-of-host-1>` and `<ip-of-host-2>` with the actual IP addresses.\n   - Replace `<username-for-host-1>` and `<username-for-host-2>` with the actual usernames.\n   - Replace `<path-to-private-key-for-host-1>` and `<path-to-private-key-for-host-2>` with the paths to your SSH private keys.\n\n### Step 2: Test Your SSH Configuration\n\n3. **Test the SSH connection**: Run the following command to ensure you can reach `host-2` via `host-1`.\n\n    ```bash\n    ssh host-2\n    ```\n\n   If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to log into `host-2` without specifying any additional parameters.\n\n### Step 3: Configure PyCharm to Use the SSH Configuration\n\n4. **Set up the remote interpreter**:\n    - Open PyCharm and go to `File > Settings` (or `PyCharm > Preferences` on macOS).\n    - Navigate to `Project: <your-project-name> > Python Interpreter`.\n    - Click on the gear icon and select `Add...`.\n    - Choose `SSH Interpreter`.\n    - In the \"Host\" field, enter `host-2` (the alias from your SSH config file).\n    - PyCharm should automatically use the SSH configuration you've set up in `~/.ssh/config`.\n\n5. **Fill out necessary details**:\n    - Enter the Python interpreter path on `host-2`.\n    - Complete any additional setup as required by your project, such as setting up deployment paths or environment variables.\n\n### Step 4: Sync Files and Code\n\n6. **Deploy your code**:\n    - If necessary, configure deployment settings in PyCharm to sync your local files to `host-2` using the SSH connection.\n\nBy using the SSH config file with the `ProxyJump` directive, you effectively manage the multi-hop SSH scenario. PyCharm will utilize this configuration to connect to `host-2` through `host-1`."
