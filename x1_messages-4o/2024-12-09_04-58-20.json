I'm using tf.keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory to load the data. According to the documentation, labels can either be \"inferred\" or a list/tuple of integer labels of the same size as the number of image files found in the directory. I have read the csv using pandas and converted it into a list which I have passed in as the labels argument. However, when I run the cell, the output reads \"Found 1164 files belonging to 1 classes.\" Is there something wrong with the format of how I'm passing in the list of classes, or are there other settings which I need to make before the label classes can take effect? Here's my code:\n\n```python\nlabels = pd.read_csv(_URL)\ntrain_labels = labels.values[:,1].tolist()\nprint(\"Total labels:\", len(train_labels))\nprint(train_labels)\n# Output: Total labels: 1164\n# [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, ... ]\ntrain_dataset = image_dataset_from_directory(directory=train_dir,\n                                         labels=train_labels,\n                                         label_mode='int',\n                                         shuffle=True,\n                                         batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,\n                                         image_size=IMG_SIZE)\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering may be related to how `tf.keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory` expects the directory structure and labels. Here are a few points to check and possible solutions for your problem:\n\n1. **Directory Structure:** `image_dataset_from_directory` expects the images to be organized in subdirectories that correspond to their class labels if the labels are being inferred. When you provide a list of labels, the directory structure might not need subfolders, but ensure the number of images matches the number of labels.\n\n2. **Label List:** Make sure that the list of labels you are providing (`train_labels`) is in the correct order corresponding to the order of the files in the directory. This function does not automatically match labels to images by filename; it assumes the order matches.\n\n3. **Label Mode:** The `label_mode='int'` is correct for integer labels, but ensure that your labels are indeed integers and correspond correctly to the images.\n\n4. **Number of Classes:** The message \"Found 1164 files belonging to 1 classes.\" suggests that the function is not recognizing your label list properly. Double-check the following:\n   - Ensure the length of `train_labels` exactly matches the number of image files in `train_dir`.\n   - Verify that `train_labels` is not empty or malformed.\n\n5. **CSV Data:** Ensure that the CSV file is being read correctly, and the labels are being extracted properly. Double-check the column index (`[:,1]`) to ensure you're extracting the correct column.\n\n6. **Debugging:** Add some debugging prints or checks:\n   - Print the first few elements of `train_labels` to make sure they look correct.\n   - Print the filenames in `train_dir` and compare them with your labels to ensure they correspond.\n\nIf the above checks don't resolve the issue, consider using a different method for loading your dataset, such as creating a custom dataset using `tf.data.Dataset` and manually pairing images with their labels. This can give you more control and clarity over the data loading process.\n\nIf you continue to face issues, feel free to share additional details about the directory structure and any other relevant code snippets for further assistance."
