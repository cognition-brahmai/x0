Here\u2019s a refined version of the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT timestamp, error_type, error_message\nFROM error_logs\nWHERE widget_name = 'online shopping widget'\nAND error_type = 'crash'\nORDER BY timestamp DESC;\n```\n\nThis query will select the `timestamp`, `error_type`, and `error_message` columns from the `error_logs` table where the `widget_name` is 'online shopping widget' and the `error_type` is 'crash'. The results will be ordered by the `timestamp` column in descending order, so the most recent logs appear first. \n\nIf you want to add more conditions or filter the results further, you can modify the `WHERE` clause accordingly."
