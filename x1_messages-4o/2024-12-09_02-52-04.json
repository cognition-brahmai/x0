I have a module named `ex_1.py`:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, I'm ex_1\")\ndef greet(name):\n print(\"Hello, \"+name+\" nice to meet you! \")\n```\n\nI import this module in another file called `1_client_ex_1.py`:\n\n```python\nimport ex_1.py\n```\n\nWhen I execute this file, I get the output `Hello, I'm ex_1` as expected. However, when I modify `1_client_ex_1.py` to import `ex_1.py` twice:\n\n```python\nimport ex_1.py\nimport ex_1.py\n```\n\nand execute it, it still only prints `Hello, I'm ex_1` once. Shouldn't it print the message twice since I imported the module twice?"

        "content": "When you import a module in Python, it is only loaded and executed once per session. This is because Python keeps track of which modules have been imported in the `sys.modules` dictionary. When you attempt to import a module a second time, Python checks `sys.modules` and sees that the module has already been loaded, so it doesn't re-execute the module's code.\n\nIn your case, when you import `ex_1.py` the first time, Python executes the code within that module, which is why you see the output `Hello, I'm ex_1`. When you import it again, Python finds that it has already been imported and does not execute the code again, hence you do not see the message printed a second time.\n\nIf you want to force a module to be reloaded, you can use the `importlib.reload()` function from the `importlib` module:\n\n```python\nimport importlib\nimport ex_1\n\n# ... some code ...\n\n# Reload the module\nimportlib.reload(ex_1)\n```\n\nThis will re-execute the code within `ex_1.py`, allowing you to see the print statement again."
