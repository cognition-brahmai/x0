The goal is to abort the tests if the compilation of the code fails. Is it possible to achieve this without wrapping the entire script inside of a while loop and using breaks, something similar to goto?"

        "content": "Yes, you can exit a Bash script immediately if a certain condition is met by using the `exit` command. This is a straightforward way to abort the script in case of a failure, such as a compilation error. Here's a basic example of how you might structure your script to exit upon a failed compilation:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Attempt to compile the code\nmake\n\n# Check if the compilation was successful\nif [ $? -ne 0 ]; then\n  echo \"Compilation failed. Aborting tests.\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\n# If the script reaches this point, it means the compilation succeeded\necho \"Compilation succeeded. Running tests...\"\n\n# Place your test commands here\n# e.g., ./run_tests.sh\n\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- The `make` command is used to compile the code. You can replace it with your specific compilation command.\n- The `$?` variable holds the exit status of the last executed command. If it is not zero, it indicates that the command failed.\n- If the compilation fails, the script prints an error message and exits with `exit 1`. The `exit` command terminates the script, and `1` is a common exit status for indicating an error.\n- If the compilation succeeds, the script continues to run the test commands.\n\nThis approach doesn't require the use of loops or `goto` (which doesn't exist in Bash), making it clean and easy to understand."
