The tutorials use a dataset and split it into two sets, a Training set and a Test set. They use the closing price of the stocks to train and create a model, which is then used to insert test data set, containing the closing price, and show two graphs. The actual and the predicted graphs are pretty much the same. Here is the github repo of the tutorial I followed: https://github.com/surajr/Stock-Predictor-using-LSTM/blob/master/Stock-Predictor-using-LSTM.ipynb. I am confused as to why the tutorials are putting closing price in the testing set also? Aren't they only supposed to insert dates, given that we are predicting the closing price? Also, none of the tutorials explain how to predict the next 7 days values. How do I use the model to get the next 7 days' closing value?"

        "content": "It's great that you're diving into artificial intelligence and exploring stock market predictions using models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks)! Let's break down your questions:\n\n### Why Include Closing Prices in the Test Set?\n\n1. **Purpose of the Test Set**: The test set is used to evaluate the model's performance. By providing the actual closing prices, you allow the model to compare its predictions against the true values. This comparison helps in assessing how well the model has learned from the training data.\n\n2. **Evaluation**: The test set includes closing prices to calculate metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or other performance indicators. These metrics tell you how accurate your model's predictions are compared to actual values.\n\n3. **Visualization**: By plotting both actual and predicted prices, you can visually inspect how well the model is performing. It's a way to validate the model's predictive power.\n\n### Using Dates for Prediction\n\n- When you predict future values, your model doesn't directly use dates as input. Instead, it uses the patterns in the time series data (like past closing prices) to predict future values.\n\n- Dates are typically not fed directly into models like LSTMs because they are not informative by themselves for the prediction. Instead, models learn the temporal dependencies from sequences of past data.\n\n### Predicting the Next 7 Days\n\nTo predict the next 7 days of stock prices using your trained LSTM model, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prepare Input Data**: Use the most recent data window that your model was trained on. This window should be the same length as your input sequence.\n\n2. **Iterative Prediction**:\n   - Use the model to predict the next day\u2019s price using the prepared input data.\n   - Append this predicted price to the input sequence, dropping the oldest data point to maintain the window size.\n   - Repeat this step for 7 iterations to predict the next 7 days.\n\n3. **Code Example**:\n   ```python\n   import numpy as np\n\n   # Assuming 'model' is your trained model and 'recent_data' is your input sequence\n   predictions = []\n   input_sequence = np.array(recent_data)  # Make sure it's the right shape for your model\n\n   for _ in range(7):\n       # Make a prediction\n       pred = model.predict(input_sequence)\n       predictions.append(pred)\n\n       # Update the input sequence, removing the first element and adding the prediction\n       input_sequence = np.append(input_sequence[1:], pred, axis=0)\n\n   print(\"Next 7 days predictions:\", predictions)\n   ```\n\n4. **Normalization/Scaling**: Remember to scale your predictions back to the original values if your data was normalized during preprocessing.\n\nBy following these steps, you can use your trained LSTM model to forecast future stock prices. Adjust the code as needed based on how your data is structured and preprocessed."
