For instance, in the following code, what should be the value of 'SOMETHING' for the function to return the _x attribute content \"foo\"?\n\n```python\ndef f():\n    return SOMETHING\n\nf._x = \"foo\"\nf()           # -> \"foo\"\n```\n\nMoreover, I would like the function to continue working even if its reference is deleted, like in the following example:\n\n```python\ng = f\ndel f\ng()          # -> \"foo\"\n```\n\nIs this possible in Python? If not, can you explain why?"

        "content": "In Python, functions are first-class objects, meaning they can have attributes just like any other object. To access a function's own attributes, you can use the special `__name__` attribute within the function to reference itself. However, this attribute directly provides the name of the function, not a reference to the function object itself.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef f():\n    return f._x\n\nf._x = \"foo\"\nprint(f())  # -> \"foo\"\n```\n\nHowever, if you want the function to continue working even if its reference is deleted, you can take advantage of closures. A closure allows a function to remember the environment in which it was created. Here's how you can modify the code to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef make_function():\n    _x = \"foo\"\n    def f():\n        return _x\n    return f\n\nf = make_function()\nprint(f())  # -> \"foo\"\n\ng = f\ndel f\nprint(g())  # -> \"foo\"\n```\n\nIn this version, `make_function` creates a closure by defining `f` inside it and returning `f`. The variable `_x` is captured in the closure, allowing `f` to access it even after `make_function` has finished executing. This way, even if the original reference to `f` is deleted, the function `g` still works because it retains access to `_x` through the closure."
