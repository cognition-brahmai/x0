        "content": "To remove all URLs from a given string in Python, you can use regular expressions (regex). Regular expressions are powerful for matching patterns in strings. Here's a simple example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef remove_urls(text):\n    # Define the regex pattern for URLs\n    url_pattern = r'http[s]?://(?:[a-zA-Z]|[0-9]|[$-_@.&+]|[!*\\\\(\\\\),]|(?:%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]))+'\n    \n    # Use re.sub to replace URLs with an empty string\n    cleaned_text = re.sub(url_pattern, '', text)\n    \n    # Remove any extra newlines that may result from removing URLs\n    cleaned_text = re.sub(r'\\n+', '\\n', cleaned_text)\n    \n    return cleaned_text.strip()\n\n# Example usage\ntext = \"\"\"\ntext1\ntext2\nhttp://url.com/bla1/blah1/\ntext3\ntext4\nhttp://url.com/bla2/blah2/\ntext5\ntext6\nhttp://url.com/bla3/blah3/\n\"\"\"\n\ncleaned_text = remove_urls(text)\nprint(cleaned_text)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `url_pattern` uses a regular expression to identify URLs. It handles both `http` and `https` URLs.\n- `re.sub()` is used to replace all occurrences of the URL pattern with an empty string, effectively removing them.\n- `re.sub(r'\\n+', '\\n', cleaned_text)` is then used to collapse multiple newlines into a single newline, which may occur after URL removal.\n- Finally, `strip()` is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace.\n\nThis script will remove all URLs and ensure that the text structure remains intact with single line breaks between entries."
