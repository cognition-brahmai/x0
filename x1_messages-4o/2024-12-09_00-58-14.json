I encountered this error when trying to set an index to a certain value in a DataFrame with a string index, integer columns, and float values.

        "content": "The error `ValueError: cannot reindex from a duplicate axis` is typically raised in pandas when you try to perform an operation that results in duplicate indices or when the operation you're attempting is not compatible with the current state of the DataFrame's index or columns.\n\nIn your case, the error occurs when you try to add a new row labeled `'sums'` to your DataFrame using `affinity_matrix.loc['sums'] = affinity_matrix.sum(axis=0)`. The issue here might not be immediately obvious, but let's consider potential causes:\n\n1. **Duplicate Index Entries**: If your DataFrame already contains duplicate indices, and you attempt to add a new index, pandas may raise this error. From your trace, we can see that you have a duplicate index `'047'` which could be related, but it's not directly causing the issue since `'sums'` is not already in the index. However, this duplicate could cause future operations to behave unexpectedly.\n\n2. **Immutable Index**: If the index of your DataFrame is immutable (which is the default behavior), trying to add a new index directly might not be allowed in certain contexts. However, `loc` should generally handle this without issue.\n\n3. **Expected vs. Actual Index Size**: When adding a new row, pandas expects that the operation is compatible with the DataFrame's current index and columns. If there's any mismatch or unexpected duplication, it could raise this error.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can try the following:\n\n- **Ensure Uniqueness**: Before adding the 'sums' row, make sure your index is unique. You can check this with `affinity_matrix.index.is_unique`, which should return `True`. If not, consider resetting the index or handling duplicates appropriately.\n\n- **Create a New DataFrame**: Instead of directly modifying the existing DataFrame, you can create a new DataFrame with the sums and concatenate it:\n\n  ```python\n  sums = pd.DataFrame(affinity_matrix.sum(axis=0)).T\n  sums.index = ['sums']\n  affinity_matrix = pd.concat([affinity_matrix, sums])\n  ```\n\n- **Ensure Compatibility**: Double-check that the operation you're performing is compatible with the current structure of your DataFrame, considering both index and column types.\n\n- **Check for Hidden Issues**: Sometimes, the issue might stem from hidden states or operations performed on the DataFrame earlier in your code. Ensure there are no prior manipulations that might interfere with this operation.\n\nBy addressing these potential issues, you should be able to successfully add the `'sums'` row to your DataFrame."
