It seems like this line is redefining `X` instead of adding Dropout to it. Here is my LSTM layer code:\n\n```python\nx = Input(shape=(input_shape), dtype='int32')\nx = LSTM(128,return_sequences=True)(x)\n```"

        "content": "In Keras, when you're using the functional API, you need to chain the layers together by passing the output of one layer as the input to the next. The error you're encountering is likely because you're not passing the previous layer's output to the `Dropout` layer. To correctly add a `Dropout` layer to an LSTM layer in a Keras functional model, you should do it like this:\n\n```python\nfrom keras.models import Model\nfrom keras.layers import Input, LSTM, Dropout\n\n# Define the input\ninputs = Input(shape=(input_shape), dtype='int32')\n\n# Add the LSTM layer\nx = LSTM(128, return_sequences=True)(inputs)\n\n# Add the Dropout layer\nx = Dropout(0.5)(x)\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=x)\n```\n\nIn this code, `x` is the output of the LSTM layer, and `Dropout(0.5)(x)` applies dropout to the output of the LSTM layer. This way, you ensure that the dropout layer is correctly added to the model, and you're maintaining the flow of data from input to output through the network layers."
