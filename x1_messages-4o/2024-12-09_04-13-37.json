        "content": "In Python, you can achieve similar functionality to MATLAB's `tic` and `toc` functions using the `time` module. The `tic` function can be mimicked by recording the current time, and the `toc` function can be mimicked by calculating the elapsed time since the recorded time. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\n# Equivalent to MATLAB's tic\nstart_time = time.time()\n\n# Your code here\n# ...\n\n# Equivalent to MATLAB's toc\nelapsed_time = time.time() - start_time\nprint(f\"Elapsed time: {elapsed_time} seconds\")\n```\n\nThis code records the start time using `time.time()`, which returns the current time in seconds since the epoch. After running the code you want to measure, it calculates the elapsed time by subtracting the start time from the current time. This will give you the elapsed time in seconds."
