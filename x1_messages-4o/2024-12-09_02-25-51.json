I have come across some information on a few websites suggesting that classes should be derived from `object` in Python, for example:\n\n```python\nclass Base(object):\n    pass\n```\n\nHowever, I do not understand the purpose of this or when it should be used. I haven't been able to find relevant official documentation about this. Is this a feature of Python 3.x?"

        "content": "In Python, the concept of deriving classes from `object` is related to the distinction between \"old-style\" and \"new-style\" classes, which was introduced in Python 2.x.\n\n### Old-style vs New-style Classes\n\n- **Old-style Classes**: In Python 2.x, if you define a class without explicitly inheriting from `object`, it is considered an old-style class.\n  \n  ```python\n  class OldStyle:\n      pass\n  ```\n\n- **New-style Classes**: If you define a class by explicitly inheriting from `object`, it becomes a new-style class.\n  \n  ```python\n  class NewStyle(object):\n      pass\n  ```\n\nNew-style classes come with numerous advantages, such as a more consistent and unified object model, support for descriptors, method resolution order (MRO) using the C3 linearization algorithm, and access to Python's built-in `super()` function.\n\n### Python 3.x\n\nIn Python 3.x, all classes are implicitly new-style classes, even if you do not explicitly inherit from `object`. This means that whether you write:\n\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n    pass\n```\n\nor\n\n```python\nclass MyClass(object):\n    pass\n```\n\nBoth are considered new-style classes in Python 3.x.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n- **Python 2.x**: It's generally recommended to always inherit from `object` to ensure your classes are new-style.\n  \n- **Python 3.x**: It's not necessary to inherit from `object`, but doing so is harmless and can make your code more consistent if you are working in a mixed Python 2.x/3.x environment or if you're following older code examples.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn Python 3.x, you can safely define your classes without inheriting from `object`, but understanding this concept is useful if you encounter Python 2.x code or are working on maintaining legacy systems."
