        "content": "I am trying to create a visually appealing widget in Tkinter and I have come across a couple of questions. First, there seems to be a light grey border around my Canvas widget, which I want to remove. How can I achieve this? Secondly, I have noticed that the top left most position in the Canvas is (2,2). I expected this to be (0,0). Why is this the case? Here is my current script:\n\n```python\nfrom Tkinter import *\n\nmaster = Tk()\nmaster.configure(bg='black')\nmaster.wm_attributes(\"-topmost\", 1)\n\nw = Canvas(master, width=150, height=40, bd=0,relief='ridge',)\nw.pack()\n\ncolor = 100\nx0 = 2\ny0 = 2\nx1 = 151\ny1 = 2\n\nwhile y0 < 20 :\n    r = color\n    g = color\n    b = color\n    rgb = r, g, b\n    Hex = '#%02x%02x%02x' % rgb\n    w.create_line(x0, y0, x1, y1,fill=str(Hex), width=1)\n    color = color - 2\n    y0 = y0 + 1\n    y1 = y1 + 1\n\ncolor = 10\n\nwhile y0 < 40 :\n    r = color\n    g = color\n    b = color\n    rgb = r, g, b\n    Hex = '#%02x%02x%02x' % rgb\n    w.create_line(x0, y0, x1, y1,fill=str(Hex), width=1)\n    color = color + 4\n    y0 = y0 + 1\n    y1 = y1 + 1\n\nmainloop()\n```"

        "content": "To address your issues with the Tkinter Canvas widget, let's look at both problems you've mentioned:\n\n1. **Removing the Light Grey Border**: The border around your Canvas widget is likely due to the default settings of the `highlightthickness` property. By default, Tkinter adds a highlight border to widgets for keyboard focus. To remove this border, you can set the `highlightthickness` property to 0.\n\n2. **Canvas Coordinate Issue**: The fact that the top-left position starts at (2,2) instead of (0,0) is because of the `borderwidth` and `highlightthickness` properties. Even if you set `bd=0`, the `highlightthickness` might still cause an offset. By setting both `bd` and `highlightthickness` to 0, you can ensure that the top-left corner of the Canvas is indeed (0,0).\n\nHere's the modified script with these adjustments:\n\n```python\nfrom tkinter import *  # Use lowercase 'tkinter' for Python 3\n\nmaster = Tk()\nmaster.configure(bg='black')\nmaster.wm_attributes(\"-topmost\", 1)\n\nw = Canvas(master, width=150, height=40, bd=0, relief='ridge', highlightthickness=0)\nw.pack()\n\ncolor = 100\nx0 = 0  # Start from 0\ny0 = 0  # Start from 0\nx1 = 150  # Adjust to not exceed the canvas width\ny1 = 0\n\nwhile y0 < 20:\n    r = color\n    g = color\n    b = color\n    rgb = r, g, b\n    Hex = '#%02x%02x%02x' % rgb\n    w.create_line(x0, y0, x1, y1, fill=str(Hex), width=1)\n    color = color - 2\n    y0 = y0 + 1\n    y1 = y1 + 1\n\ncolor = 10\n\nwhile y0 < 40:\n    r = color\n    g = color\n    b = color\n    rgb = r, g, b\n    Hex = '#%02x%02x%02x' % rgb\n    w.create_line(x0, y0, x1, y1, fill=str(Hex), width=1)\n    color = color + 4\n    y0 = y0 + 1\n    y1 = y1 + 1\n\nmainloop()\n```\n\nNote: I changed `from Tkinter import *` to `from tkinter import *` to reflect the correct import for Python 3. If you are using Python 2, keep it as `Tkinter`."
