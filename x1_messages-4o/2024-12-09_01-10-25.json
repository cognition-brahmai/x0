However, I had an issue with the installation of PyQt4 which resulted in these error messages: 'ImportError: No module named PyQt4.QtCore', and 'ImportError: No module named PyQt4.QtCore'. I believe this is due to PyQt4 not being installed correctly. The libraries were located at C:\\Python27\\Lib but not for PyQt4. I am looking for guidance on how to properly install PyQt4 and use it to convert a webpage to a PDF."

        "content": "If you're having trouble with PyQt4, it might be worth considering using a more modern and easier approach to convert a webpage to a PDF in Python. One popular library for this task is `pdfkit`, which relies on `wkhtmltopdf`. Here's how you can use it:\n\n### Step 1: Install `wkhtmltopdf`\n\n1. Download `wkhtmltopdf` from the official website: [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html).\n2. Install it on your system. Make sure to add the installation directory to your system's PATH environment variable so that it can be accessed from anywhere in the command line.\n\n### Step 2: Install `pdfkit`\n\nYou can install `pdfkit` via pip:\n\n```bash\npip install pdfkit\n```\n\n### Step 3: Convert a Webpage to PDF\n\nHere's a simple script to convert a webpage to a PDF using `pdfkit`:\n\n```python\nimport pdfkit\n\n# URL of the webpage to convert\nurl = 'http://example.com'\n\n# Output PDF file path\noutput_path = 'output.pdf'\n\n# Convert webpage to PDF\npdfkit.from_url(url, output_path)\n```\n\n### Additional Configuration\n\nIf `wkhtmltopdf` is not in your PATH, you can specify the path to the executable:\n\n```python\nimport pdfkit\n\npath_to_wkhtmltopdf = r'C:\\Program Files\\wkhtmltopdf\\bin\\wkhtmltopdf.exe'  # Adjust this path as necessary\nconfig = pdfkit.configuration(wkhtmltopdf=path_to_wkhtmltopdf)\n\nurl = 'http://example.com'\noutput_path = 'output.pdf'\n\npdfkit.from_url(url, output_path, configuration=config)\n```\n\nThis approach should be easier and more reliable than using PyQt4, as `pdfkit` is specifically designed for creating PDF files from HTML content. If you still want to use PyQt4, you may need to ensure it's correctly installed, or consider using PyQt5, which is more up-to-date. However, for the task you mentioned, `pdfkit` should suffice."
