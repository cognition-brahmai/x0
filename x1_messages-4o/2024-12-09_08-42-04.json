The code I'm working on is as follows:\n\n```python\nPRICE_RANGES = {\n                64:(25, 0.35),\n                32:(13, 0.40),\n                16:(7, 0.45),\n                8:(4, 0.5)\n                }\n\ndef get_order_total(quantity):\n    global PRICE_RANGES\n    _total = 0\n    _i = PRICE_RANGES.iterkeys()\n    def recurse(_i):\n        try:\n            key = _i.next()\n            if quantity % key != quantity:\n                _total += PRICE_RANGES[key][0]\n            return recurse(_i) \n        except StopIteration:\n            return (key, quantity % key)\n\n    res = recurse(_i)\n```\n\nHowever, I get an error saying \"global name '_total' is not defined\". I understand that the issue is with the `_total` assignment, but I'm not sure why this is happening. Doesn't the `recurse()` function have access to the parent function's variables? Can someone explain to me what I'm missing about python variable scope?"

        "content": "In Python, nested functions have access to variables in their enclosing scope, but they are read-only by default. If you try to modify a variable from an enclosing scope within a nested function, Python will treat it as a local variable unless you explicitly tell it otherwise using the `nonlocal` keyword. The `global` keyword you've used is not applicable in this context because `_total` is not a global variable but a local one within the `get_order_total` function.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to resolve the scope issue by using the `nonlocal` keyword for `_total`:\n\n```python\nPRICE_RANGES = {\n    64: (25, 0.35),\n    32: (13, 0.40),\n    16: (7, 0.45),\n    8: (4, 0.5)\n}\n\ndef get_order_total(quantity):\n    _total = 0\n    _i = iter(PRICE_RANGES.keys())  # use iter() for Python 3 compatibility\n    def recurse(_i):\n        nonlocal _total  # Declare _total as nonlocal\n        try:\n            key = next(_i)  # use next() for Python 3 compatibility\n            if quantity % key != quantity:\n                _total += PRICE_RANGES[key][0]\n            return recurse(_i)\n        except StopIteration:\n            return (key, quantity % key)\n\n    res = recurse(_i)\n    return _total\n\n# Example usage\ntotal = get_order_total(100)\nprint(total)\n```\n\nA few additional points:\n\n1. **Iterating Keys**: In Python 3, `dict.iterkeys()` has been removed, and you can directly use `iter(dict.keys())` for getting an iterator over the dictionary keys.\n\n2. **`nonlocal` Keyword**: This keyword allows you to modify variables in the enclosing function scope (but not global scope).\n\n3. **Final Return**: I added a return statement at the end of `get_order_total` to return the computed `_total`, assuming you want to use it.\n\nMake sure to adjust the function as needed for your specific purpose and test it with different inputs to ensure it behaves as expected."
