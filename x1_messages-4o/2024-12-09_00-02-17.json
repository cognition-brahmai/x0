        "content": "Implementing a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for a complex game like \"Doom\" is an ambitious project, especially when using Ruby, which is not typically the go-to language for such tasks. However, with the right libraries and approach, it's possible to create a reinforcement learning (RL) model. Here\u2019s a basic outline of how you might go about it, focusing on using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and optimizing hyperparameters.\n\n### Step 1: Set Up the Environment\n\nFirst, ensure you have all necessary dependencies installed. Ruby has a limited ecosystem for deep learning compared to Python, but you can use libraries like `torch.rb` for neural networks and `numo-narray` for numerical computations.\n\n### Step 2: Design the Neural Network\n\nYou can use a CNN to process game frames. Here\u2019s a simple example of how you might define a CNN in Ruby using `torch.rb`:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'torch'\n\nclass DoomCNN < Torch::NN::Module\n  def initialize(action_space)\n    super()\n    @conv1 = Torch::NN::Conv2d.new(3, 32, 8, stride: 4)\n    @conv2 = Torch::NN::Conv2d.new(32, 64, 4, stride: 2)\n    @conv3 = Torch::NN::Conv2d.new(64, 64, 3, stride: 1)\n    @fc1 = Torch::NN::Linear.new(64 * 7 * 7, 512)\n    @fc2 = Torch::NN::Linear.new(512, action_space)\n  end\n\n  def forward(x)\n    x = Torch::Functional.relu(@conv1.call(x))\n    x = Torch::Functional.relu(@conv2.call(x))\n    x = Torch::Functional.relu(@conv3.call(x))\n    x = x.view([-1, 64 * 7 * 7])\n    x = Torch::Functional.relu(@fc1.call(x))\n    @fc2.call(x)\n  end\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Define the Deep Q-Learning Algorithm\n\nImplement the deep Q-learning algorithm, which will use this network to decide actions based on the state of the game.\n\n```ruby\nclass DQLAgent\n  attr_accessor :policy_net, :target_net, :optimizer\n\n  def initialize(action_space, learning_rate)\n    @policy_net = DoomCNN.new(action_space)\n    @target_net = DoomCNN.new(action_space)\n    @target_net.load_state_dict(@policy_net.state_dict)\n    @optimizer = Torch::Optim::Adam.new(@policy_net.parameters, lr: learning_rate)\n  end\n\n  def select_action(state, epsilon)\n    if rand < epsilon\n      return rand(action_space)\n    else\n      with Torch.no_grad do\n        return @policy_net.call(state).argmax.item\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\n  # Additional methods for training, updating the target network, and replay memory would go here\nend\n```\n\n### Step 4: Optimize Hyperparameters\n\nYou would then need to experiment with different hyperparameters. A typical approach is to use a grid search or random search to find optimal values for the learning rate, batch size, discount factor, etc.\n\n### Step 5: Training Loop\n\nIn the training loop, you would interact with the \"Doom\" environment, which you could access via wrappers for the VizDoom library in Python. You would gather experiences, store them in a replay buffer, and use them to train your network.\n\n### Step 6: Evaluation\n\nFinally, evaluate the performance of your algorithm based on metrics like the number of actions taken, rewards earned, and time taken to complete the game.\n\n### Challenges and Considerations\n\n- **Integration with VizDoom**: Ruby doesn't have direct support for VizDoom, so you might need to use Ruby-Python bridges like `PyCall` or run the environment in Python and communicate with Ruby.\n- **Performance**: Ruby is not as fast as Python for numerical computations, so consider using optimized libraries or even some parts in Python.\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: This is a trial-and-error process and can be computationally expensive.\n\nWhile this serves as a basic outline, the actual implementation will require a significant amount of fine-tuning and optimization. For serious work in RL, Python is the predominant choice due to its robust ecosystem and community support."
