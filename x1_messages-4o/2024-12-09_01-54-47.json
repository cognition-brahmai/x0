Here is my code:\n\n```python\ndef logger(myFunc):\n    def new(*args, **keyargs):\n        print 'Entering %s.%s' % (myFunc.im_class.__name__, myFunc.__name__)\n        return myFunc(*args, **keyargs)\n\n    return new\n\nclass C(object):\n    @logger\n    def f():\n        pass\n\nC().f()\n```\nBut instead of the desired output, I am getting an AttributeError: \"'function' object has no attribute 'im_class'\". Why is this happening? It seems to be something related to the scope of 'myFunc' inside 'logger', but I am not sure."

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that `myFunc` is a function object, and in Python 3.x, function objects do not have an `im_class` attribute. The `im_class` attribute was part of the method objects in Python 2.x. Since you are using Python 3.x, you need to access the class name differently.\n\nOne way to achieve your desired behavior is to use the `__qualname__` attribute of the function, which gives you the qualified name including the class name. Here's how you can adjust your code:\n\n```python\ndef logger(myFunc):\n    def new(*args, **keyargs):\n        print('Entering %s' % myFunc.__qualname__)\n        return myFunc(*args, **keyargs)\n\n    return new\n\nclass C(object):\n    @logger\n    def f(self):\n        pass\n\nC().f()\n```\n\nIn this modified version, `myFunc.__qualname__` provides the fully qualified name of the method, which includes the class name and the method name. This will output \"Entering C.f\" as you intended.\n\nAlso, note that the `f` method in class `C` should take `self` as its first parameter since it is an instance method."
