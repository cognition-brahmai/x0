My file directory is organized as follows:\n\n```\nJupyter notebooks\\\n    notebook1.ipynb\n    new_module\\\n        __init__.py\n        newfunction.py\n    currentnotebooks\\\n        notebook2.ipynb\n```\nI am able to import the new module into `notebook1.ipynb` using `import new_module` but when I try the same command in `notebook2.ipynb`, I encounter an error `ImportError: No module named 'new_module'`. The two solutions I could think of are either moving `new_module` into the `currentnotebooks` directory or moving `notebook2.ipynb` up to the same level as `new_module`. However, I would prefer not to change the file structure. Is there a way to solve this issue without changing the file structure?"

        "content": "To import a module from a different directory in Jupyter Notebook without changing your file structure, you can modify the Python path dynamically to include the directory where your module resides. You can do this using the `sys` module to append the path to your Python path. Here's how you can achieve that in `notebook2.ipynb`:\n\n1. First, import the `sys` and `os` modules.\n2. Use `os.path` to dynamically construct the path to the `new_module` directory.\n3. Append this path to the `sys.path` list.\n\nHere is how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport os\n\n# Construct the path to the new_module directory\nmodule_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join('..', 'new_module'))\n\n# Add the module path to the Python path\nif module_path not in sys.path:\n    sys.path.append(module_path)\n\n# Now you can import your module\nimport new_module\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `os.path.abspath(os.path.join('..', 'new_module'))` constructs the absolute path to the `new_module` directory by navigating one directory up from `currentnotebooks` and then into `new_module`.\n- `sys.path.append(module_path)` adds this path to the Python path, allowing you to import modules from there.\n\nThis way, you can import `new_module` into `notebook2.ipynb` without changing your directory structure."
