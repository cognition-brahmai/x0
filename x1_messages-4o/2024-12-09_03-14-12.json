Currently, in development, I have the `settings.DEBUG` set to `True` and it allows me to see nicely formatted errors with a good stack trace and request information. However, for my production site, I prefer to use `DEBUG=False` and display a standard error 500 page to visitors with a message that I'm working on fixing the bug. I would also like to log all this information (stack trace and request info) to a file on my server so that I can output it to my console, or email the log to myself every hour. What logging solutions would you recommend for such a requirement on a django site? The application I'm running is a `fcgi` server and I'm using Apache web server as a front end (although I'm considering switching to lighttpd)."

        "content": "To log server errors on your Django site in production while keeping `DEBUG=False`, you can set up Django's built-in logging framework. Here's how you can configure it to log errors, stack traces, and request information:\n\n1. **Configure Logging in Django Settings:**\n\n   In your `settings.py`, you can set up a logging configuration using Python's standard logging module. Here's an example configuration that logs errors to a file:\n\n   ```python\n   LOGGING = {\n       'version': 1,\n       'disable_existing_loggers': False,\n       'formatters': {\n           'verbose': {\n               'format': '{levelname} {asctime} {module} {message}',\n               'style': '{',\n           },\n           'simple': {\n               'format': '{levelname} {message}',\n               'style': '{',\n           },\n       },\n       'handlers': {\n           'file': {\n               'level': 'ERROR',\n               'class': 'logging.FileHandler',\n               'filename': '/path/to/your/logfile.log',\n               'formatter': 'verbose',\n           },\n           'console': {\n               'level': 'ERROR',\n               'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',\n               'formatter': 'simple',\n           },\n       },\n       'loggers': {\n           'django': {\n               'handlers': ['file', 'console'],\n               'level': 'ERROR',\n               'propagate': True,\n           },\n       },\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Replace `'/path/to/your/logfile.log'` with the actual path where you want to store your log files.\n\n2. **Add Request Information:**\n\n   To include request information in your logs, you can create a custom logging filter. Here's an example:\n\n   ```python\n   import logging\n\n   class RequestFilter(logging.Filter):\n       def filter(self, record):\n           try:\n               request = record.request\n               record.ip = request.META.get('REMOTE_ADDR')\n               record.user = request.user if hasattr(request, 'user') else 'Unknown'\n           except Exception:\n               record.ip = 'Unknown'\n               record.user = 'Unknown'\n           return True\n\n   LOGGING['filters'] = {\n       'request': {\n           '()': RequestFilter,\n       },\n   }\n\n   LOGGING['handlers']['file']['filters'] = ['request']\n   ```\n\n3. **Email Alerts for Errors:**\n\n   If you want to get email notifications for errors, you can add an email handler:\n\n   ```python\n   LOGGING['handlers']['mail_admins'] = {\n       'level': 'ERROR',\n       'class': 'django.utils.log.AdminEmailHandler',\n       'include_html': True,\n   }\n\n   LOGGING['loggers']['django']['handlers'].append('mail_admins')\n   ```\n\n   Ensure you have configured `ADMINS` and your email backend settings in `settings.py` to use this handler.\n\n4. **Scheduled Email of Logs:**\n\n   If you want to email the logs periodically, you can use a cron job or a task scheduler like Celery to send the log file as an attachment. This involves writing a management command or a custom script to email the log file.\n\n5. **Switching to Lighttpd:**\n\n   If you decide to switch to Lighttpd, ensure that you configure it properly to serve your Django application, similar to how you would configure Apache. The logging setup in Django remains unchanged since it is independent of your web server choice.\n\nBy following these steps, you will have a robust logging mechanism in place that logs errors, includes request information, and optionally sends email notifications for critical issues."
