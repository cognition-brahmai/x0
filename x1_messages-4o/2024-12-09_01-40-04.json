        "content": "I have created a custom vector class in Python and defined a `__mul__` method to handle multiplication. It works as expected when I perform an operation like `vector(1, 2, 3) * 2`, returning a vector `<2, 4, 6>`. However, when I try to reverse the operands as in `2 * vector(1, 2, 3)`, I get a TypeError because the built-in int class does not support multiplication by my user-defined vectors. I could potentially solve this problem by writing a new multiplication function like:\n\n```python\ndef multiply(a, b):\n    try:\n        return a * b\n    except TypeError:\n        return b * a\n```\n\nBut this means I would need to redefine every function that I want to use with my user-defined classes. Is there a way to make the built-in function handle this correctly without needing to redefine every function for my user-defined classes?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this functionality by implementing the `__rmul__` method in your custom vector class. The `__rmul__` method is called when the left operand does not support the multiplication operation with the right operand. By defining this method, you allow Python to handle the reversed multiplication operation (`2 * vector(1, 2, 3)`) gracefully.\n\nHere's how you can modify your vector class to include the `__rmul__` method:\n\n```python\nclass Vector:\n    def __init__(self, *components):\n        self.components = components\n        \n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"Vector{self.components}\"\n    \n    def __mul__(self, scalar):\n        if isinstance(scalar, (int, float)):\n            return Vector(*(x * scalar for x in self.components))\n        raise TypeError(\"Unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'Vector' and '{}'\".format(type(scalar).__name__))\n    \n    def __rmul__(self, scalar):\n        # This method handles the reversed multiplication: scalar * vector\n        return self.__mul__(scalar)\n\n# Example usage:\nv = Vector(1, 2, 3)\nprint(v * 2)  # Outputs: Vector(2, 4, 6)\nprint(2 * v)  # Outputs: Vector(2, 4, 6)\n```\n\nBy adding the `__rmul__` method, you enable your vector class to handle both `vector * scalar` and `scalar * vector` operations seamlessly. This eliminates the need to redefine such operations externally, providing a more intuitive and Pythonic use of your custom class."
