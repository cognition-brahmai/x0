I am aware that pywin32 can be used for this task on Windows and there are certain packages that work on Linux/Unix. However, I am specifically interested in a solution that can be used across all these platforms."

        "content": "Yes, there is a cross-platform Python package called **`watchdog`** that you can use to monitor the contents of files or directories. The `watchdog` library is designed to work on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux/Unix systems, making it an excellent choice for cross-platform file and directory monitoring.\n\nTo get started with `watchdog`, you can install it via pip:\n\n```bash\npip install watchdog\n```\n\nHere's a basic example of how you can use `watchdog` to monitor a directory for changes:\n\n```python\nimport time\nfrom watchdog.observers import Observer\nfrom watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler\n\nclass MyEventHandler(FileSystemEventHandler):\n    def on_modified(self, event):\n        print(f'Modified: {event.src_path}')\n    \n    def on_created(self, event):\n        print(f'Created: {event.src_path}')\n    \n    def on_deleted(self, event):\n        print(f'Deleted: {event.src_path}')\n    \n    def on_moved(self, event):\n        print(f'Moved: {event.src_path} to {event.dest_path}')\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    path = \".\"  # Directory to monitor\n    event_handler = MyEventHandler()\n    observer = Observer()\n    observer.schedule(event_handler, path, recursive=True)\n    observer.start()\n\n    try:\n        while True:\n            time.sleep(1)\n    except KeyboardInterrupt:\n        observer.stop()\n    observer.join()\n```\n\nIn this example, a custom event handler class (`MyEventHandler`) is defined, which inherits from `FileSystemEventHandler`. This class handles different types of file system events like modification, creation, deletion, and movement. The `Observer` is then used to watch a specified directory and trigger the corresponding event methods when changes are detected.\n\nThis setup will print out messages to the console whenever files in the specified directory are modified, created, deleted, or moved. Adjust the `path` variable to the directory you want to monitor."
