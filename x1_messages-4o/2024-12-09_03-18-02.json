        "content": "In Python 2.6, there isn't a built-in function specifically named `clamp` to restrict a floating-point number within a specified range. However, you can easily implement this functionality using a simple function. Here's how you can create your own `clamp` function:\n\n```python\ndef clamp(value, min_value, max_value):\n    return max(min_value, min(value, max_value))\n\n# Example usage:\nmyValue = 7.5\nmin_value = 5.0\nmax_value = 10.0\n\nclamped_value = clamp(myValue, min_value, max_value)\nprint(clamped_value)  # Output: 7.5\n```\n\nIn this implementation, the `min` function ensures that `value` is not greater than `max_value`, and the `max` function ensures that the result is not less than `min_value`. This effectively clamps `value` within the specified range `[min_value, max_value]`."
