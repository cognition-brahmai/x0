Here's a simple example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Styled Text Example</title>\n    <style>\n        .large-green-text {\n            font-size: 24px; /* Adjust the font size as needed */\n            color: green; /* Set the text color to green */\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <p class=\"large-green-text\">The cat was playing in the garden</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n1. The HTML `<style>` tag is used within the `<head>` section to define CSS styles.\n2. A CSS class named `.large-green-text` is created to style the text.\n3. The `font-size` property is set to `24px` to make the text larger. You can adjust this value to make it larger or smaller based on your preference.\n4. The `color` property is set to `green` to change the text color to green.\n5. The `<p>` tag uses the `class` attribute to apply the `.large-green-text` style to the sentence.\n\nYou can include this HTML code in your webpage to display the styled sentence. Adjust the `font-size` as needed for your design requirements."
