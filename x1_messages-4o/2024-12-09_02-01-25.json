In the implementation, I noticed there is a constraint that the embed_dim must be divisible by num_heads. The relevant code is `assert self.head_dim * num_heads == self.embed_dim, \"embed_dim must be divisible by num_heads\"`. If we refer back to the equation of MultiheadAttention, we see that the matrices Q, K, V are n x embed_dim, the weight matrices W are embed_dim x head_dim, and the output is a n x embed_dim matrix. So, why do we require that the embed_dim must be divisible by num_heads? Even if we have num_heads=10000, it seems that the result would still be the same, as the matrix-matrix product would absorb this information."

        "content": "The requirement for `embed_dim` to be divisible by `num_heads` in the implementation of MultiheadAttention in PyTorch, and similar frameworks, is primarily a design choice to ensure that each attention head processes an equal portion of the input embeddings. Let's break down why this constraint exists:\n\n1. **Division of Workload**: In multi-head attention, the input embeddings (Q, K, V) are split into multiple \"heads,\" and each head is responsible for a portion of the input. By ensuring `embed_dim` is divisible by `num_heads`, each head gets an equal-sized chunk of the input embeddings to process. This is crucial for parallel processing and efficient computation, as each head can independently compute its attention outputs without needing to handle different-sized inputs.\n\n2. **Simplicity in Implementation**: Having `embed_dim` divisible by `num_heads` simplifies the implementation. Each head can have a fixed `head_dim` of `embed_dim / num_heads`, which allows for straightforward reshaping and matrix operations. This avoids complex logic to handle cases where the division might not be even, which could complicate the attention mechanism and potentially introduce inefficiencies.\n\n3. **Consistency in Output Dimensions**: When each head computes its attention output, these outputs are concatenated to form the final output matrix that matches the original `embed_dim`. Ensuring equal partitioning helps maintain consistency in the dimensions of intermediate computations and the final result.\n\n4. **Avoiding Redundancy**: If `num_heads` were not a factor of `embed_dim`, then some heads might end up with no information to process or redundant computations, which wouldn't contribute meaningfully to the final output.\n\nWhile theoretically, you could have a `num_heads` value that doesn't evenly divide `embed_dim` by adjusting the internal operations to handle leftovers or unequal divisions, it would add unnecessary complexity without a clear advantage in most practical scenarios. Thus, the constraint simplifies both the conceptual model and the computational implementation of multi-head attention."
