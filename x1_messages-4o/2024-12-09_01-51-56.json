I want to access the results of the query using the following style: print site.ci. But it seems SQLAlchemy returns tuples for this query, not dicts. How can I get the result as a dictionary instead of a tuple?"

        "content": "To achieve the behavior where you can access the query result using attribute-style access (e.g., `site.ci`), you can utilize SQLAlchemy's `ResultProxy` to fetch the results as dictionaries. A common approach is to use the `fetchone()` method in combination with `keys()` to map the column names to their respective values. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine, text\n\n# Assuming you have a `db_session` or `engine` object already created\n# Example for creating an engine:\n# engine = create_engine('your_database_connection_string')\n\n# Your SQL query\nquery = \"\"\"\nSELECT Coalesce((SELECT sp.param_value\n                 FROM   sites_params sp\n                 WHERE  sp.param_name = 'ci'\n                        AND sp.site_id = s.id\n                 ORDER  BY sp.id DESC\n                 LIMIT  1), -1) AS ci\nFROM   sites s\nWHERE  s.deleted = 0\n       AND s.id = 10 \n\"\"\"\n\n# Execute the query\nresult = db_session.execute(text(query))\n\n# Fetch one result and map it to a dictionary\nrow = result.fetchone()\n\n# Convert the row to a dictionary\nif row:\n    site = dict(row.items())\n    print(site)  # {'ci': '375'}\n\n    # Accessing by key\n    print(site['ci'])  # '375'\nelse:\n    site = None\n\n# This way, you can access the result as a dictionary\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`text(query)`**: This ensures that your query is executed as a raw SQL string.\n- **`fetchone()`**: Fetches a single row from the result set.\n- **`row.items()`**: This method returns an iterable of key-value pairs, mapping column names to their respective values.\n- **`dict(row.items())`**: Converts the iterable of key-value pairs into a dictionary, allowing you to access the results using keys.\n\nThis approach will allow you to access the result using a dictionary, enabling you to do `site['ci']` or `site.get('ci')` for safe access."
