        "content": "To get the name of a process using its Process ID (PID) in Python, you can use the `psutil` library, which provides an easy way to retrieve information about system processes. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. First, you need to install the `psutil` library if you haven't already. You can do this using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install psutil\n   ```\n\n2. Once installed, you can use the following Python code to get the process name by its PID:\n\n   ```python\n   import psutil\n\n   def get_process_name(pid):\n       try:\n           process = psutil.Process(pid)\n           return process.name()\n       except psutil.NoSuchProcess:\n           return None\n\n   # Example usage\n   pid = 1234  # Replace with the actual PID\n   process_name = get_process_name(pid)\n   if process_name:\n       print(f\"Process name: {process_name}\")\n   else:\n       print(\"No process found with the given PID.\")\n   ```\n\nIn this code, the `psutil.Process(pid)` function creates a process instance with the given PID, and `process.name()` retrieves the name of the process. If the process does not exist, it handles the `psutil.NoSuchProcess` exception and returns `None`."
