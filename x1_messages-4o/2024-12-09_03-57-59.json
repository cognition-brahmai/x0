Despite following all the steps in the README, the debug toolbar does not appear. Additionally, the 'debug' prefix is not found among the recognized URL patterns for my web app, even though I've ensured the debug_toolbar module is loaded by the activated debug_toolbar application. I am testing this with an SSH tunnel from the machine running the browser to the machine running the Django/Apache. I discovered that the IP address seen for the remote machine was not what I expected, and so the list of \"good\" IPs did not contain the browser's apparent remote machine. Could this be the issue? What should I do to make the debug toolbar visible?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing with the Django Debug Toolbar not appearing could indeed be related to the IP address configuration. Here are some steps and checks you can perform to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Internal IPs**:\n   Ensure that the IP address from which you are accessing the application is included in the `INTERNAL_IPS` setting. Since you are using an SSH tunnel, the remote IP address might be different from what you expect. You can add `'127.0.0.1'` and `'localhost'` to `INTERNAL_IPS`, as these are typically used for local development.\n\n   ```python\n   INTERNAL_IPS = [\n       '127.0.0.1',\n       'localhost',\n       'your_actual_ip',  # Add the IP address seen by the server\n   ]\n   ```\n\n   You can also add a wildcard to allow all IPs temporarily for debugging purposes, but this is not recommended for production.\n\n2. **Debug Mode**:\n   Make sure that your Django application is running in `DEBUG` mode. The Debug Toolbar will not appear if `DEBUG` is set to `False`.\n\n   ```python\n   DEBUG = True\n   ```\n\n3. **Middleware Configuration**:\n   Double-check that the `debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware` is correctly added to your `MIDDLEWARE` settings and placed at the beginning of the list, right after `django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware` if you have it.\n\n   ```python\n   MIDDLEWARE = [\n       'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',\n       'debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware',\n       # other middlewares\n   ]\n   ```\n\n4. **Installed Apps**:\n   Confirm that `'debug_toolbar'` is included in your `INSTALLED_APPS`.\n\n   ```python\n   INSTALLED_APPS = [\n       # other apps\n       'debug_toolbar',\n   ]\n   ```\n\n5. **URL Configuration**:\n   Ensure that your `urls.py` is correctly set up to include the Debug Toolbar URLs.\n\n   ```python\n   from django.conf import settings\n   from django.conf.urls import include, url\n\n   if settings.DEBUG:\n       import debug_toolbar\n       urlpatterns = [\n           # other url patterns\n           url(r'^__debug__/', include(debug_toolbar.urls)),\n       ] + urlpatterns\n   ```\n\n6. **Static Files**:\n   Ensure that static files are properly configured and accessible. The Debug Toolbar injects its JavaScript via static files.\n\n7. **Browser Caching**:\n   Clear your browser cache or try accessing the site in incognito mode to ensure you're not seeing a cached version of the page without the toolbar.\n\n8. **Network Configuration**:\n   Since you mentioned using an SSH tunnel, ensure that the tunnel is properly set up and that there is no network-related issue preventing the toolbar from loading.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to see the Django Debug Toolbar on your web app. If the issue persists, consider checking the browser's developer console for any JavaScript errors or network requests that might be failing."
