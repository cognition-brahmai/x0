I attempted to do this using regular expressions with the following code: \n\n```python\nraw_data.columns.values = re.sub(' $','',raw_data.columns.values)\n```\n\nHowever, this is not working as expected. Can you point out what I did wrong?"

        "content": "Certainly! The issue you're facing is due to the way you're trying to apply the regular expression to the column names. The `re.sub` function is designed to work on strings, but `raw_data.columns.values` returns an array of column names. You need to apply the regular expression to each column name individually.\n\nYou can achieve this using a list comprehension or by using the `str.replace` method that Pandas provides for string operations on Series objects. Here are two ways you can do it:\n\n1. **Using List Comprehension:**\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nraw_data.columns = [re.sub(r'\\s+$', '', col) for col in raw_data.columns]\n```\n\n2. **Using Pandas' `str.replace`:**\n\n```python\nraw_data.columns = raw_data.columns.str.replace(r'\\s+$', '', regex=True)\n```\n\nBoth of these approaches will effectively remove any trailing spaces from the column names in your DataFrame. Make sure to use `r'\\s+$'` to correctly specify the regular expression for trailing spaces."
