For instance, my expected result should be:\n\nAAA\nBBB\nTest, Test\nCCC\n\nI tried using the csv package in Python but had no luck, as it seems to parse all commas. Here's my code:\n\n```python\nimport csv\nwith open('values.csv', 'rb') as f:\n    reader = csv.reader(f)\n    for row in reader:\n        print row\n```\n\nCan anyone help me understand what I'm missing?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is likely due to the CSV reader not correctly recognizing the quotes because of the spaces following the commas in your file. The `csv` module in Python should handle quoted fields correctly if the quotes are formatted properly. However, in your case, the whitespace within the quotes might be causing the issue.\n\nHere's how you can address the problem:\n\n1. Use the `csv` module with the correct `quotechar` and `delimiter` settings.\n2. Strip any whitespace around the quoted fields.\n\nHere's an updated version of your code that should work:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\n# Open the CSV file\nwith open('values.csv', 'r', newline='') as f:\n    # Use csv.reader with the appropriate settings\n    reader = csv.reader(f, delimiter=',', quotechar='\"', skipinitialspace=True)\n    \n    # Iterate over each row in the CSV file\n    for row in reader:\n        # Print each cell, stripped of any extra whitespace\n        for cell in row:\n            print(cell.strip())\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **`quotechar='\"'`:** This tells the CSV reader to recognize double quotes as the character that encapsulates a field.\n- **`skipinitialspace=True`:** This skips any spaces following the delimiter, which is helpful when handling spaces after commas.\n- **`strip()`:** This removes any leading or trailing whitespace from each cell before printing.\n\nWith these settings, the `csv` module should correctly parse the lines and treat commas within quoted fields as part of the field content. Make sure your CSV file is saved with a consistent structure and the quotes are correctly placed around fields containing commas."
