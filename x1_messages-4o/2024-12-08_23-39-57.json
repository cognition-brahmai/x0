Each friend has a different favorite color, which are blue, green, yellow, and red. Using the table below, can you figure out each friend's favorite color based on the clues provided?\n|         | Friend's Name | Favorite Color |\n|---------|---------------|----------------|\n| Friend 1 |               |                |\n| Friend 2 |               |                |\n| Friend 3 |               |                |\n| Friend 4 |               |                |\n1.

        "content": "Let's solve this step-by-step using the clues provided:\n\n1. **The lawyer's favorite color is red.**\n   - So, the lawyer's favorite color is red.\n\n2. **The doctor's favorite color is not yellow.**\n\n3. **The friend who likes blue is not a chef.**\n   - So, the chef's favorite color is not blue.\n\n4. **The teacher's favorite color is not green.**\n\nLet's assign colors based on the clues:\n\n- Since the lawyer's favorite color is red, the lawyer is Friend 4 with the color red.\n\nNow, let's eliminate and assign based on remaining clues:\n\n- The doctor's favorite color is not yellow, and it cannot be red (lawyer's). So, it can be either blue or green.\n- The teacher's favorite color is not green, and it cannot be red. So, it can be either blue or yellow.\n- The chef cannot like blue.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n- If the doctor likes green, then:\n  - The teacher can only like yellow.\n  - The chef can only like blue (since the lawyer is red, and teacher is yellow).\n\nLet's assign this:\n\n- **Friend 1 (Doctor):** Green\n- **Friend 2 (Teacher):** Yellow\n- **Friend 3 (Chef):** Blue\n- **Friend 4 (Lawyer):** Red\n\nThus, the table is filled as follows:\n\n|         | Friend's Name | Favorite Color |\n|---------|---------------|----------------|\n| Friend 1 | Doctor        | Green          |\n| Friend 2 | Teacher       | Yellow         |\n| Friend 3 | Chef          | Blue           |\n| Friend 4 | Lawyer        | Red            |\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the given clues."
