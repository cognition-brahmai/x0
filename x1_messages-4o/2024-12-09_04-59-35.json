I have created a .numpy-site.cfg file to successfully install Numpy with MKL, but when using the same file for Scipy, I encounter an error. The error message is: \"ImportError: libmkl_rt.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\". Even after using \"export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013_sp1/mkl/lib/intel64\", the problem persists. I would prefer not to install Scipy manually, so I am seeking advice on how to correct this.\n\nThe .numpy-site.cfg file contents are as follows:\n\n```shell\n[mkl]\nlibrary_dirs=/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013_sp1/mkl/lib/intel64/\ninclude_dirs=/opt/intel/mkl/include/\nmkl_libs=mkl_intel_lp64,mkl_intel_thread,mkl_core,mkl_rt\nlapack_libs=\n```"

        "content": "To install SciPy with MKL using pip on Ubuntu, you need to ensure that the environment is properly configured for MKL. The error message you are encountering indicates that the system cannot find the `libmkl_rt.so` shared library, which is essential for linking with MKL.\n\nHere are the steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify MKL Installation**: Ensure that the MKL libraries are installed correctly and the paths specified in your `.numpy-site.cfg` are accurate.\n\n2. **Update Environment Variables**:\n   - Make sure the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable includes the directory where `libmkl_rt.so` is located. Double-check that the path is correct and points to the MKL library directory.\n   ```bash\n   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013_sp1/mkl/lib/intel64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Intel MKL with APT**:\n   - You can use the Intel MKL package available in Ubuntu's package manager. This might provide a more straightforward installation process.\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt update\n   sudo apt install intel-mkl\n   ```\n\n4. **Configure pip to Use MKL**:\n   - When using pip, you can specify environment variables directly in the command line to ensure they are set during the installation process:\n   ```bash\n   MKLROOT=/opt/intel/mkl pip install scipy\n   ```\n   - It's important to set `MKLROOT` to the directory where MKL is installed.\n\n5. **Check for Python Version Compatibility**:\n   - Ensure that the version of SciPy you are trying to install is compatible with your version of Python and Numpy.\n\n6. **Use a Virtual Environment**:\n   - It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. This isolates your Python environment, reducing the risk of conflicts.\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n7. **Install MKL Optimized Numpy and Scipy**:\n   - You can install pre-compiled MKL-optimized versions of Numpy and Scipy through Intel's channel using `conda`, which simplifies the process significantly.\n   ```bash\n   conda create -n scipy_mkl_env python=3.9\n   conda activate scipy_mkl_env\n   conda install -c intel numpy scipy\n   ```\n\n8. **Verify Installation**:\n   - After installation, verify that SciPy is using MKL by importing it and checking the linked libraries.\n   ```python\n   import numpy as np\n   np.show_config()\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to install and configure SciPy with MKL on your Ubuntu system using pip. If problems persist, ensure all paths are correct, and that there are no conflicting installations of MKL."
