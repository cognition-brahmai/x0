I applied Youden's J to find the best classification threshold, which came out to be 0.63. How do I incorporate this threshold into the `gbm` model in `caret` to get more accurate predictions, and then re-run the model on the training data again? Currently, it defaults to 0.5 and I am unable to find a way to update the threshold. Alternatively, is the threshold merely used to separate the test data predictions into the correct class? If so, how do I reflect the change in the ROC_AUC plot, assuming the probability should be updated based on the new threshold?\n\nHere is the code I've been working with:\n\n```R\nlibrary(datasets)\nlibrary(caret)\nlibrary(MLeval)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndata(iris)\ndata <- as.data.frame(iris)\n\n# create class\ndata$class <- ifelse(data$Species == \"setosa\", \"yes\", \"no\")\n\n# split into train and test\ntrain <- data %>% sample_frac(.70)\ntest <- data %>% sample_frac(.30)\n\n\n# Set up control function for training\nctrl <- trainControl(method = \"cv\",\n                     number = 5, \n                     returnResamp = 'none',\n                     summaryFunction = twoClassSummary,\n                     classProbs = T,\n                     savePredictions = T,\n                     verboseIter = F)\n\n# Set up training grid - this is based on a hyper-parameter tune that was recently done\ngbmGrid <-  expand.grid(interaction.depth = 10,\n                        n.trees = 20000,                                          \n                        shrinkage = 0.01,                                         \n                        n.minobsinnode = 4) \n\n\n# Build a standard classifier using a gradient boosted machine\nset.seed(5627)\ngbm_iris <- train(class ~ .,\n                   data = train,\n                   method = \"gbm\",\n                   metric = \"ROC\",\n                   tuneGrid = gbmGrid,\n                   verbose = FALSE,\n                   trControl = ctrl)\n\n# Calculate best thresholds\ncaret::thresholder(gbm_iris, threshold = seq(.01,0.99, by = 0.01), final = TRUE, statistics = \"all\")\n\npred <- predict(gbm_iris, newdata = test, type = \"prob\")\nroc <- evalm(data.frame(pred, test$class))\n```"

        "content": "In the `caret` package, the `train` function and the models it supports (like the `gbm` model) do not directly allow you to set a custom classification threshold for predictions. The default threshold used to classify instances as either class is 0.5. However, you can apply your custom threshold after obtaining the predicted probabilities.\n\nHere's how you can incorporate the custom threshold of 0.63 into your workflow:\n\n1. **Predict Probabilities**: Use the model to get the predicted probabilities for the positive class (`yes` in your case).\n\n2. **Apply Custom Threshold**: Convert these probabilities to class labels based on your threshold (0.63).\n\n3. **Re-evaluate Model Performance**: Use these labels to calculate performance metrics and plot ROC curves.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to apply these steps:\n\n```r\n# Predict probabilities on the test set\npred_probs <- predict(gbm_iris, newdata = test, type = \"prob\")\n\n# Apply the custom threshold to get class predictions\npred_classes <- ifelse(pred_probs[, \"yes\"] > 0.63, \"yes\", \"no\")\n\n# Evaluate the performance using the custom threshold\nconf_matrix <- confusionMatrix(factor(pred_classes, levels = c(\"no\", \"yes\")), test$class)\nprint(conf_matrix)\n\n# To reflect this in the ROC_AUC plot, you can plot the ROC curve and indicate the threshold\nlibrary(pROC)\n\nroc_curve <- roc(test$class, pred_probs[, \"yes\"])\nplot(roc_curve, col = \"blue\", main = \"ROC Curve with Custom Threshold\")\nabline(v = 0.63, col = \"red\", lty = 2) # Add a vertical line for the threshold\ntext(0.63, 0.5, labels = \"Threshold = 0.63\", pos = 4, col = \"red\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Predict Probabilities**: `predict(gbm_iris, newdata = test, type = \"prob\")` gives you the predicted probabilities for each class.\n\n- **Threshold Application**: Use `ifelse` to classify observations into \"yes\" or \"no\" based on whether the predicted probability is greater than 0.63.\n\n- **Performance Evaluation**: Use the `confusionMatrix` function to evaluate how well the threshold performs.\n\n- **ROC Curve**: Use the `pROC` package to plot the ROC curve and add a vertical line at your threshold to visualize its effect.\n\nNote: The threshold doesn't change the model or its training process; it only affects how you interpret the predicted probabilities."
