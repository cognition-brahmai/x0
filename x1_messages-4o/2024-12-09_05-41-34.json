This can be done using triple quotes (`'''` or `\"\"\"`). Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nascii_art = \"\"\"\n    Your ASCII Art\n    Goes Here\n    Like This\n\"\"\"\n\nprint(ascii_art)\n```\n\nYou can replace the content inside the triple quotes with your ASCII art or any multi-line text you wish to print. This method preserves the formatting, including newlines and spaces, making it perfect for ASCII art."
