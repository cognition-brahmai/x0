        "content": "How can I handle exceptions in the iterator of a for loop in Python? I am running a for loop to read a CSV file using the `csv.reader()` method. I have set a limit on the field size to 10 characters using `csv.field_size_limit(10)`. However, the loop aborts when it encounters a field with more than 10 characters. Is there an elegant way to catch this exception and continue with the loop, without having to rewrite the loop using `while True` or a similar construct? Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\ncsv.field_size_limit(10)\n\nreader = csv.reader(open('test.csv', 'r'))\nfor line in reader:\n    print(line)\n```\n\nAnd here is the CSV file:\n\n```\nfoo,bar,baz\nxxx,veryverylong,yyy\nabc,def,ghi\n```\n\nI would like to find a way to skip or log the failing lines and continue."

        "content": "To handle exceptions in the iterator of a `for` loop in Python, you can use a `try-except` block within the loop. This allows you to catch exceptions for individual lines and decide how to handle them (e.g., skipping the line, logging the error, etc.) without aborting the entire loop.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to catch exceptions and continue processing:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\ncsv.field_size_limit(10)\n\nreader = csv.reader(open('test.csv', 'r'))\n\nfor line_number, line in enumerate(reader, start=1):\n    try:\n        print(line)\n    except csv.Error as e:\n        # Log the error or handle it as needed\n        print(f\"Error processing line {line_number}: {e}\")\n        # Optionally skip the failing line and continue\n        continue\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We wrap the `print(line)` statement inside a `try` block.\n- The `except csv.Error as e` block catches exceptions specific to the CSV parsing.\n- We log the error with the line number using `enumerate` for better traceability.\n- We use `continue` to skip the problematic line and continue with the next iteration.\n\nThis approach allows you to handle exceptions gracefully without rewriting the loop structure."
