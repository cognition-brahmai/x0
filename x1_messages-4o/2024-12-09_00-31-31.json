I tried using the following syntax, but it is incorrect and is not working as expected:\n\n```python\narr[1, 4, 5]\n```\n\nCan you guide me on how to correctly extract multiple values from a NumPy array using their indices?"

        "content": "To extract multiple values from a NumPy array using specific index positions, you should pass the indices as a list or an array to the array's indexing operation. The syntax you attempted to use (`arr[1, 4, 5]`) is incorrect because it is trying to index a multi-dimensional array. Instead, you should use a list or an array to specify the indices, like this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\narr = np.array([100.10, 200.42, 4.14, 89.00, 34.55, 1.12])\n\n# Correct way to extract values at index positions 1, 4, and 5\nselected_values = arr[[1, 4, 5]]\n\nprint(selected_values)\n```\n\nThis will output the values at the specified indices:\n\n```\n[200.42  34.55   1.12]\n```\n\nBy using a list of indices (`[1, 4, 5]`), NumPy knows to extract the elements at those positions from the array."
