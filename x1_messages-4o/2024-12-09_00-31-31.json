        "content": "To create a composite key in SQLAlchemy with the fields `firstName` and `lastName`, and then use this composite key in a relation with another model `Book`, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the `Author` Model with a Composite Primary Key:**\n\n   First, define the `Author` model with a composite primary key consisting of `firstName` and `lastName`.\n\n   ```python\n   from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, String, ForeignKey, Table\n   from sqlalchemy.orm import declarative_base, relationship\n\n   Base = declarative_base()\n\n   class Author(Base):\n       __tablename__ = 'authors'\n\n       firstName = Column(String, primary_key=True)\n       lastName = Column(String, primary_key=True)\n\n       # Relationship to the Book model\n       books = relationship('Book', back_populates='author')\n\n   ```\n\n2. **Define the `Book` Model with a Foreign Key Relationship:**\n\n   Next, define the `Book` model and create a foreign key relationship using the composite key from the `Author` model.\n\n   ```python\n   class Book(Base):\n       __tablename__ = 'books'\n\n       id = Column(String, primary_key=True)\n       title = Column(String)\n\n       author_firstName = Column(String, ForeignKey('authors.firstName'), primary_key=True)\n       author_lastName = Column(String, ForeignKey('authors.lastName'), primary_key=True)\n\n       # Relationship to the Author model\n       author = relationship('Author', back_populates='books')\n   ```\n\n3. **Set Up the Database Engine and Create the Tables:**\n\n   Now, you can set up the database engine and create the tables.\n\n   ```python\n   engine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:')\n   Base.metadata.create_all(engine)\n   ```\n\n4. **Explanation:**\n\n   - In the `Author` model, `firstName` and `lastName` are defined as the composite primary key.\n   - In the `Book` model, `author_firstName` and `author_lastName` are foreign keys that reference the composite primary key in the `Author` model.\n   - The `relationship` function is used to create a bidirectional relationship between the `Author` and `Book` models.\n\nThis setup allows you to use the composite key from the `Author` model as a foreign key in the `Book` model, maintaining referential integrity between the two tables."
