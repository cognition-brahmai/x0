I am not looking to generate the actual combinations, instead I want the number of possible combinations. I've been trying to find a function in the 'math', 'numpy' or 'stat' libraries that could do this, but I haven't been successful. I'm looking for a function of the type: `comb = calculate_combinations(n, r)`. The numbers I'll be calculating the combinations for can get quite large, so I want to avoid using factorials as they could get exceedingly large."

        "content": "To compute combinations \\((nCr)\\) without directly using factorials, you can use an iterative approach to calculate the result efficiently. This method avoids the large intermediate numbers that can occur when computing factorials directly. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_combinations(n, r):\n    if r > n:\n        return 0\n    if r == 0 or r == n:\n        return 1\n    r = min(r, n - r)  # Use the property nCr = nC(n-r)\n    comb = 1\n    for i in range(1, r + 1):\n        comb = comb * (n - i + 1) // i\n    return comb\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 10\nr = 3\ncomb = calculate_combinations(n, r)\nprint(f\"The number of combinations ({n} choose {r}) is: {comb}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Symmetry Property**: The function first uses the property that \\((nCr = nC(n-r))\\) to minimize the number of multiplication and division operations. This is because choosing `r` items out of `n` is the same as leaving out `n-r` items.\n\n2. **Iterative Multiplication and Division**: Instead of calculating \\(n!\\), \\(r!\\), and \\((n-r)!\\) separately, the function iteratively multiplies and divides to compute the combination count, which prevents the intermediate results from becoming excessively large.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: This method is efficient and handles large values of `n` and `r` without running into overflow issues common with factorial calculations.\n\nThis approach will efficiently give you the number of combinations without using factorials and is suitable for relatively large values of `n` and `r`."
