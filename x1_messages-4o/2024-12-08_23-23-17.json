Convert Timestamp 1 from EST to UTC:\n   - 12:00 PM EST is 5:00 PM UTC (since EST is UTC-5).\n\n2. Timestamp 2 is already in GMT (which aligns with UTC), so it remains 5:00 PM UTC.\n\nNow, both timestamps are 5:00 PM UTC, so there is no time difference between them in terms of hours and minutes.\n\nIf you have different specific timestamps in mind, please provide them, and I can help calculate the exact time difference."
