I have also tried using `as_index=False` to return the results without the multi-index, but it still gives me a multi-index. I know I can use `.reset_index()`, but it is very slow for my use case. Is there a way to return the results, without the Multi-index, using parameters of the `groupby` and/or `agg` function and without having to resort to using `reset_index()`?"

        "content": "If you're facing performance issues with `.reset_index()` and want to avoid using it, you can try a few alternative methods to flatten the results without a multi-index when using `groupby` and `agg`. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Use Named Aggregations (Pandas 0.25.0+)**: This allows you to specify custom names for the aggregated columns, which can help in avoiding multi-index columns.\n\n   ```python\n   aggregated_df = pe_odds.groupby('EVENT_ID', as_index=False).agg(\n       SELECTION_ID=('SELECTION_ID', 'first'),  # or other aggregate functions\n       ODDS=('ODDS', 'mean')                   # or other aggregate functions\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. **Flatten Multi-Index Columns Directly**: If you're dealing with a multi-index column, you can flatten it using a list comprehension to rename the columns directly after aggregation.\n\n   ```python\n   aggregated_df = pe_odds.groupby('EVENT_ID').agg({\n       'SELECTION_ID': 'first',   # or other aggregate functions\n       'ODDS': 'mean'             # or other aggregate functions\n   })\n\n   # Flatten the multi-index columns\n   aggregated_df.columns = ['_'.join(col).strip() if isinstance(col, tuple) else col for col in aggregated_df.columns.values]\n   ```\n\n3. **Use `pipe` for Custom Operations**: If you have more complex operations and need to keep performance in mind, consider using `pipe` to apply custom functions on the grouped data.\n\n   ```python\n   def custom_aggregation(group):\n       return pd.Series({\n           'SELECTION_ID': group['SELECTION_ID'].iloc[0],  # or other custom logic\n           'ODDS': group['ODDS'].mean()                    # or other custom logic\n       })\n\n   aggregated_df = pe_odds.groupby('EVENT_ID', as_index=False).pipe(lambda g: g.apply(custom_aggregation))\n   ```\n\nThese methods should help you achieve the desired result without resorting to `.reset_index()`, while maintaining performance. The named aggregation method is particularly efficient for straightforward aggregation tasks."
