        "content": "To convert the sentence \"The mouse was eaten by the cat\" to active voice, you should rearrange it so that the subject performs the action. The active voice version is: \"The cat ate the mouse.\"\n\nHere's an example of a compound-complex sentence with a relative clause using the active voice version of the sentence:\n\"The cat, which prowled silently through the night, ate the mouse while the other cats watched, and the owner slept peacefully.\"\n\n### Difference Between Active and Passive Voice\n\n**Active Voice**: In active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the action expressed by the verb. This structure is direct and often more engaging. For example, \"The cat ate the mouse.\"\n\n**Passive Voice**: In passive voice, the subject receives the action. The focus is on the action or the receiver of the action rather than who is performing it. For example, \"The mouse was eaten by the cat.\"\n\n**Impact on Sentence Structure and Emphasis**:\n- **Clarity and Directness**: Active voice typically makes sentences clearer and more direct. It emphasizes the doer of the action.\n- **Emphasis on Action/Receiver**: Passive voice shifts the focus to the action itself or the receiver of the action. It can be useful when the doer is unknown or less important.\n- **Length and Complexity**: Passive sentences often require more words, which can make them longer and sometimes more complex.\n\n### Java Code for String Manipulation Demonstrating Active and Passive Voice\n\nHere is a simple Java program that demonstrates basic string manipulation to convert between active and passive voice:\n\n```java\npublic class VoiceConverter {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String activeVoice = \"The cat ate the mouse.\";\n        String passiveVoice = convertToPassive(activeVoice);\n        \n        System.out.println(\"Active Voice: \" + activeVoice);\n        System.out.println(\"Passive Voice: \" + passiveVoice);\n    }\n\n    // Convert a simple active voice sentence to passive voice\n    public static String convertToPassive(String active) {\n        // This is a simplistic conversion assuming the sentence follows \"Subject Verb Object\" structure\n        String[] words = active.split(\" \");\n        if (words.length < 4) {\n            return \"Conversion not possible for this sentence.\";\n        }\n        // Extract subject, verb, object from the sentence\n        String subject = words[0];\n        String verb = words[1];\n        String object = words[2];\n        \n        // Convert the verb to past participle (simplified for this example)\n        String pastParticiple = verb + \"en\"; // Note: This is a naive approach\n        if (verb.equals(\"ate\")) {\n            pastParticiple = \"eaten\";\n        }\n\n        // Construct the passive voice sentence\n        return object + \" was \" + pastParticiple + \" by \" + subject + \".\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis program demonstrates a simple way to convert an active voice sentence to passive voice using string manipulation. Note that the verb conversion to past participle is highly simplified and may not be accurate for all verbs. In practice, more sophisticated linguistic processing would be necessary to handle various verb forms and sentence structures properly."
