I want to display these as `lastname, firstname middlename`. I tried creating a calculated field in the model as shown in the code below, but I am getting an error that says `value_to_string() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)`. I am not sure what `obj` means in this context. Moreover, after modifying my code as per a suggestion, I am now getting an error that says `EmployeeAdmin.list_display[1], 'name' is not a callable or an attribute of 'EmployeeAdmin' of found in the model 'Employee'`. How should I solve this?\n\n```\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.contrib import admin\n\nclass Employee(models.Model):\n    lastname = models.CharField(\"Last\", max_length=64)\n    firstname = models.CharField(\"First\", max_length=64)\n    middlename = models.CharField(\"Middle\", max_length=64)\n    clocknumber = models.CharField(max_length=16)\n\n    @property\n    def name(self):\n        return ''.join(\n            [self.lastname,' ,', self.firstname, ' ', self.middlename])\n\n    class Meta:\n        ordering = ['lastname','firstname', 'middlename']\n\nclass EmployeeAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    list_display = ('clocknumber','name')\n    fieldsets = [(\"Name\", {\"fields\":((\"lastname\", \"firstname\", \"middlename\"), \"clocknumber\")}),\n]\n\nadmin.site.register(Employee, EmployeeAdmin)\n```"

        "content": "To address the issues you're facing with your Django model and admin configuration, let's tackle them one at a time.\n\n### Problem 1: Calculated Field in the Model\n\nYou have correctly added a calculated field using a property method in your `Employee` model. However, there is a slight mistake in the string join method. You should use `join` correctly to concatenate strings. Here's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nclass Employee(models.Model):\n    lastname = models.CharField(\"Last\", max_length=64)\n    firstname = models.CharField(\"First\", max_length=64)\n    middlename = models.CharField(\"Middle\", max_length=64)\n    clocknumber = models.CharField(max_length=16)\n\n    @property\n    def name(self):\n        # Correcting the concatenation method\n        return f\"{self.lastname}, {self.firstname} {self.middlename}\"\n\n    class Meta:\n        ordering = ['lastname', 'firstname', 'middlename']\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Admin List Display\n\nThe error you're facing in the admin configuration is because Django admin is not recognizing `name` as a valid attribute to be displayed in the `list_display` because it's a property. To solve this, you need to ensure that `name` is callable from the admin class. You might need to explicitly define it as a method within the `EmployeeAdmin` class. Here's how to do it:\n\n```python\nclass EmployeeAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    list_display = ('clocknumber', 'get_full_name')  # Use a method instead of a property\n\n    def get_full_name(self, obj):\n        # Access the name property from the Employee model\n        return obj.name\n\n    get_full_name.short_description = 'Name'  # Set a custom column header\n\n    fieldsets = [\n        (\"Name\", {\"fields\": ((\"lastname\", \"firstname\", \"middlename\"), \"clocknumber\")}),\n    ]\n\nadmin.site.register(Employee, EmployeeAdmin)\n```\n\n### Summary\n\n- Ensure that the `name` property returns a properly formatted string.\n- Use a method in the `EmployeeAdmin` class to display the calculated field in `list_display`.\n- Use `short_description` to provide a human-readable name for the column in the admin interface.\n\nBy structuring your code this way, Django will properly recognize and display the calculated field in the admin interface."
