        "content": "To retrieve the weather forecast for Seoul, South Korea, using the OpenWeatherMap API in JSON format for tomorrow's date, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Sign Up and Get an API Key:**\n   - Go to the [OpenWeatherMap website](https://openweathermap.org/) and sign up for an account.\n   - After signing up, navigate to the API section and generate an API key. You'll need this key to authenticate your requests.\n\n2. **Choose the Appropriate API Endpoint:**\n   - For weather forecasts, you can use the \"5 Day / 3 Hour Forecast\" API endpoint. This endpoint provides weather data in 3-hour intervals for the next 5 days.\n\n3. **Construct the API Request URL:**\n   - Use the following URL format to query the weather forecast for Seoul:\n     ```\n     http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q=Seoul,KR&appid=YOUR_API_KEY&units=metric\n     ```\n   - Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.\n   - The `units=metric` parameter ensures that the temperature is returned in Celsius. You can omit this if you prefer the default Kelvin.\n\n4. **Parse the JSON Response:**\n   - The response will be in JSON format and will contain weather data in 3-hour intervals.\n   - Look for the forecast data corresponding to tomorrow's date. This will require iterating over the 'list' array in the JSON response and filtering the entries based on the desired date.\n\n5. **Example Python Code:**\n   Here's an example in Python using the `requests` library to fetch and print the weather forecast for tomorrow:\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n   from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n   # Define your API key and city\n   api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'\n   city = 'Seoul,KR'\n\n   # Calculate tomorrow's date\n   tomorrow = (datetime.now() + timedelta(days=1)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')\n\n   # Construct the request URL\n   url = f'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q={city}&appid={api_key}&units=metric'\n\n   # Send the request\n   response = requests.get(url)\n   data = response.json()\n\n   # Filter the forecast for tomorrow\n   forecast_for_tomorrow = [entry for entry in data['list'] if entry['dt_txt'].startswith(tomorrow)]\n\n   # Output the forecast\n   for forecast in forecast_for_tomorrow:\n       time = forecast['dt_txt']\n       temp = forecast['main']['temp']\n       description = forecast['weather'][0]['description']\n       print(f\"Time: {time}, Temperature: {temp}\u00b0C, Description: {description}\")\n   ```\n\nThis script will print the weather forecast for Seoul for tomorrow, including the temperature and a brief description, at 3-hour intervals."
