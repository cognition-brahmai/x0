        "content": "Certainly! Dividing the word \"configure\" into its constituent syllables while considering English phonotactics and stress patterns involves understanding its phonetic structure. The word \"configure\" is pronounced as /k\u0259n\u02c8f\u026a\u0261.j\u028ar/, where the stress is placed on the second syllable. Here's how you could represent this structure using XML:\n\n```xml\n<word>\n    <syllable>\n        <phoneme>k\u0259n</phoneme>\n    </syllable>\n    <syllable stress=\"primary\">\n        <phoneme>\u02c8f\u026a\u0261</phoneme>\n    </syllable>\n    <syllable>\n        <phoneme>j\u028ar</phoneme>\n    </syllable>\n</word>\n```\n\nIn this XML representation:\n- Each `<syllable>` element contains a `<phoneme>` tag representing the phonetic breakdown of the syllable.\n- The `stress` attribute is used to indicate the primary stress on the second syllable. \n\nThis structure respects the phonotactics of the English language and highlights the stress pattern accurately."
