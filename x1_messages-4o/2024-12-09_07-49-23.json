I executed the following block of code:\n\n```python\nfor row in table.find_all('tr'):\n    cells = row.find_all('td')\n    for c,cell in enumerate(cells):\n        print c,\":\",cell.get_text().strip()\n    try:\n        this = cells[0]\n        that = cells[1]\n        the_docket = cells[2]\n        other_thign = cells[3]\n        jumble = re.sub('\\s+',' ',str(cells[5])).strip()            \n    except:\n        \"Nope\"\n```\n\nAfter running it, I realized that I need to add a line to it. However, when I press \"enter\" in iPython, the command runs instead of allowing me to edit it. How can I edit this multi-line command within iPython?"

        "content": "In IPython, once you execute a block of code, you cannot directly edit it like you would in a text editor. However, you have a few options to effectively modify and re-run your multi-line code:\n\n1. **Use the `%edit` Magic Command:**\n   - You can use the `%edit` magic command to open an external text editor where you can edit your code. Once you save and close the editor, the code will be executed.\n   - Type `%edit` followed by the line number or block identifier of the code you want to edit. IPython will open your default text editor with the code block, allowing you to modify it.\n\n2. **Use a Cell in Jupyter Notebook:**\n   - If you are using Jupyter Notebook, simply add a new cell or modify the existing cell containing the code. Jupyter Notebook allows for easy editing and re-running of code blocks.\n   - This approach is more visual and might be easier if you are dealing with large blocks of code.\n\n3. **Re-enter the Code in IPython:**\n   - If you prefer to stick to the IPython terminal, you can manually re-enter the multi-line code. Start with the `for` loop and, instead of pressing `Enter` at the end of each line, use `Shift + Enter` to move to the next line without executing the code block.\n   - This method allows you to add new lines or modify existing ones as needed.\n\n4. **Use an External Script:**\n   - Write your code in a Python script file (e.g., `script.py`) using a text editor, and then run it using the `%run` magic command in IPython: `%run script.py`.\n   - This method is beneficial for more extensive code blocks and provides a clear separation between code writing and execution.\n\nThese methods will help you manage and edit multi-line commands effectively in IPython. Choose the one that best fits your workflow and needs."
