        "content": "To create a password field in a Django model and ensure it behaves like a password field in your forms, you need to make some adjustments. \n\n1. **Use a form widget to mask the password input:** In Django, you can use the `forms.PasswordInput` widget to render the password field as a password input in your form.\n\n2. **Hash the password before saving it to the database:** It's important to ensure that passwords are stored securely. You should hash passwords before saving them to your database. Django provides utilities for this.\n\nHere's how you can update your code:\n\n### Update `models.py`\n\nSince you're directly working with the `User` model, consider extending Django's built-in `AbstractBaseUser` or `AbstractUser` if you plan to handle authentication yourself. Otherwise, if you just want a simple model, you can keep it as it is but ensure you handle password hashing.\n\n### Update `forms.py`\n\nUse the `forms.PasswordInput` widget to render the password field as a password input field:\n\n```python\nfrom django import forms\nfrom .models import User\n\nclass UserForm(forms.ModelForm):\n    password = forms.CharField(widget=forms.PasswordInput)\n\n    class Meta:\n        model = User\n        fields = ['username', 'password']\n```\n\n### Hash the password before saving:\n\nIn order to hash the password before saving, you can override the `save` method in your form or model:\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib.auth.hashers import make_password\n\nclass UserForm(forms.ModelForm):\n    password = forms.CharField(widget=forms.PasswordInput)\n\n    class Meta:\n        model = User\n        fields = ['username', 'password']\n\n    def save(self, commit=True):\n        user = super(UserForm, self).save(commit=False)\n        user.password = make_password(self.cleaned_data['password'])\n        if commit:\n            user.save()\n        return user\n```\n\n### Important Reminder\n\nIf you are dealing with user authentication, consider using Django's built-in authentication system. It provides robust security features out of the box and is well-integrated into the Django ecosystem. You can extend Django's `AbstractUser` or `AbstractBaseUser` to customize the user model rather than creating your own from scratch."
