These functions, when called, print output to my Linux terminal which I want to suppress. I tried redirecting stdout / stderr but failed to catch the output. I suspect these functions are wrappers for compiled C-code, which is actually doing the printing. I am looking for a way to perform a \"deep-capture\" of any print handed to stdout / stderr by a function, including any sub-functions that function calls. I have also tried creating a context manager to suppress stdout and stderr but it lets through raised exceptions as well as some logger print. Can anyone help me understand why this is happening and how to solve it?"

        "content": "Suppressing output from compiled C-code or external libraries can be challenging, especially if they are directly interacting with the standard I/O streams. Here are a few strategies you might consider to achieve \"deep-capture\" of all output, including from such functions:\n\n### 1. Using `os.dup2` to Redirect File Descriptors\n\nYou can use the `os` module to redirect file descriptors for `stdout` and `stderr`. This method works at a lower level and is often effective for capturing output from compiled code.\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\n\nclass SuppressStdoutStderr:\n    def __enter__(self):\n        # Redirect stdout and stderr to /dev/null\n        self.stdout = os.dup(1)\n        self.stderr = os.dup(2)\n        self.devnull = os.open(os.devnull, os.O_WRONLY)\n        os.dup2(self.devnull, 1)\n        os.dup2(self.devnull, 2)\n\n    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):\n        # Restore stdout and stderr\n        os.dup2(self.stdout, 1)\n        os.dup2(self.stderr, 2)\n        os.close(self.devnull)\n\n# Usage\nwith SuppressStdoutStderr():\n    your_function_call_here()\n```\n\n### 2. Using `subprocess` Module\n\nIf you have control over how the functions are called, you can run them in a separate process using the `subprocess` module and redirect the output.\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\ndef run_function():\n    # Assuming `your_script.py` is the script that calls the function\n    result = subprocess.run(['python', 'your_script.py'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)\n    # Access captured stdout and stderr\n    print(result.stdout.decode())\n    print(result.stderr.decode())\n\nrun_function()\n```\n\n### 3. Patching `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr`\n\nIf the library uses Python's `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr`, you can temporarily replace them.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\nclass SuppressOutput:\n    def __enter__(self):\n        self._stdout = sys.stdout\n        self._stderr = sys.stderr\n        sys.stdout = io.StringIO()\n        sys.stderr = io.StringIO()\n\n    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):\n        sys.stdout = self._stdout\n        sys.stderr = self._stderr\n\n# Usage\nwith SuppressOutput():\n    your_function_call_here()\n```\n\n### 4. LD_PRELOAD Trick\n\nFor Unix-like systems, you can use `LD_PRELOAD` to preload a custom shared library that intercepts the `write` system calls.\n\n1. Create a C file (e.g., `intercept.c`):\n\n    ```c\n    #define _GNU_SOURCE\n    #include <dlfcn.h>\n    #include <stdio.h>\n    #include <unistd.h>\n\n    ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count) {\n        static ssize_t (*real_write)(int, const void *, size_t) = NULL;\n        if (!real_write) {\n            real_write = dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, \"write\");\n        }\n\n        if (fd == STDOUT_FILENO || fd == STDERR_FILENO) {\n            // Suppress output\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n        return real_write(fd, buf, count);\n    }\n    ```\n\n2. Compile it to a shared library:\n\n   ```bash\n   gcc -shared -fPIC -o intercept.so intercept.c -ldl\n   ```\n\n3. Run your Python script with `LD_PRELOAD`:\n\n   ```bash\n   LD_PRELOAD=./intercept.so python your_script.py\n   ```\n\n### Considerations\n\n- **Exceptions and Logs**: If exceptions and logs are still visible, they might be printed directly to `stderr`. Ensure your redirection methods cover both `stdout` and `stderr`.\n- **Testing**: Test these methods in a safe environment before using them in production, as they can have unintended side effects.\n- **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to modify file descriptors or preload libraries, especially if running on a shared system or server.\n\nThese methods should help you suppress unwanted output from functions in your script. Adjust and test them according to your specific use case and environment."
