My current list is as follows: \n\n```python\nfruitColourMapping = [{'apple': 'red'}, {'banana': 'yellow'}]\n```\n\nI am trying to convert it into a single dictionary as such:\n\n```python\nfinalMap = {'apple': 'red', 'banana': 'yellow'}\n```\n\nI have tried using the itertools.chain method as follows: \n\n```python\nfrom itertools import chain\nfruits = list(chain.from_iterable([d.keys() for d in fruitColourMapping]))\ncolour = list(chain.from_iterable([d.values() for d in fruitColourMapping]))\nreturn dict(zip(fruits, colour))\n```\n\nIs there a more efficient or pythonic way to achieve this?"

        "content": "Yes, there is a more efficient and pythonic way to flatten a list of dictionaries into a single dictionary in Python. You can utilize dictionary comprehension along with the `update()` method to achieve this without needing to use `itertools`. Here's a simple approach:\n\n```python\nfruitColourMapping = [{'apple': 'red'}, {'banana': 'yellow'}]\n\nfinalMap = {}\nfor d in fruitColourMapping:\n    finalMap.update(d)\n\nprint(finalMap)\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can achieve the same result using a dictionary comprehension with a generator expression:\n\n```python\nfruitColourMapping = [{'apple': 'red'}, {'banana': 'yellow'}]\n\nfinalMap = {k: v for d in fruitColourMapping for k, v in d.items()}\n\nprint(finalMap)\n```\n\nBoth methods will give you the desired output:\n\n```python\n{'apple': 'red', 'banana': 'yellow'}\n```\n\nThese approaches are concise and leverage Python's built-in capabilities for handling dictionaries efficiently."
