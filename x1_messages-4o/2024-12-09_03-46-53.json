After the merge, I notice that all the rows are duplicated even though the columns that I merged upon contain the same values. I am using the following code: `merged_df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on=['email_address'], how='inner')`. The two dataframes `df1` and `df2` and the resulting `merged_df` are as follows:\n\n`df1`\n```\nemail_address    name   surname\n0  john.smith@email.com    john     smith\n1  john.smith@email.com    john     smith\n2       elvis@email.com   elvis   presley\n```\n`df2`\n```\nemail_address    street  city\n0  john.smith@email.com   street1    NY\n1  john.smith@email.com   street1    NY\n2       elvis@email.com   street2    LA\n```\n`merged_df`\n```\nemail_address    name   surname    street  city\n0  john.smith@email.com    john     smith   street1    NY\n1  john.smith@email.com    john     smith   street1    NY\n2  john.smith@email.com    john     smith   street1    NY\n3  john.smith@email.com    john     smith   street1    NY\n4       elvis@email.com   elvis   presley   street2    LA\n5       elvis@email.com   elvis   presley   street2    LA\n```\nI am expecting my `merged_df` to look like this:\n```\nemail_address    name   surname    street  city\n0  john.smith@email.com    john     smith   street1    NY\n1  john.smith@email.com    john     smith   street1    NY\n2       elvis@email.com   elvis   presley   street2    LA\n```\nIs there a way to achieve this?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the presence of duplicate rows in both `df1` and `df2` before the merge operation. When you perform an inner join, each row from `df1` is matched with each row from `df2` on the `email_address` column, resulting in the duplicated rows in the `merged_df`.\n\nTo get the expected result, you can remove the duplicate rows from both `df1` and `df2` before performing the merge. You can achieve this using the `drop_duplicates` method in pandas. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample data\ndata1 = {\n    'email_address': ['john.smith@email.com', 'john.smith@email.com', 'elvis@email.com'],\n    'name': ['john', 'john', 'elvis'],\n    'surname': ['smith', 'smith', 'presley']\n}\n\ndata2 = {\n    'email_address': ['john.smith@email.com', 'john.smith@email.com', 'elvis@email.com'],\n    'street': ['street1', 'street1', 'street2'],\n    'city': ['NY', 'NY', 'LA']\n}\n\ndf1 = pd.DataFrame(data1)\ndf2 = pd.DataFrame(data2)\n\n# Remove duplicates\ndf1_unique = df1.drop_duplicates()\ndf2_unique = df2.drop_duplicates()\n\n# Perform the merge\nmerged_df = pd.merge(df1_unique, df2_unique, on='email_address', how='inner')\n\n# Display the result\nprint(merged_df)\n```\n\nBy using `drop_duplicates`, you ensure that each dataframe has unique rows based on all columns before the merge, which should give you the expected result:\n\n```\n         email_address   name  surname   street city\n0  john.smith@email.com   john    smith  street1   NY\n1       elvis@email.com  elvis  presley  street2   LA\n```\n\nIf you want to preserve rows with duplicate email addresses but unique information in other columns, you may need a different approach, such as aggregating the data or applying a custom logic to select which duplicates to keep."
