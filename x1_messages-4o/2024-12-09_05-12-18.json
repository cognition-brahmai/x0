I have successfully accomplished this task, but when the image is displayed, the window only shows a portion of the full image. I have verified that I am reading the entire image by saving it after loading and it saves the whole image. Here is my code:\n\n```python\nimgFile = cv.imread('1.jpg')\n\ncv.imshow('dst_rt', imgFile)\ncv.waitKey(0)\ncv.destroyAllWindows()\n```\n\nI am also attaching the image and the screenshot for reference. Why is the window not displaying the full image?"

        "content": "When using OpenCV's `cv.imshow()` function, the window created to display the image does not automatically resize to fit the entire image if the image dimensions exceed the screen resolution or the default window size. This is likely why you're only seeing a portion of the image.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you have a few options:\n\n1. **Resize the Image Before Displaying:**\n   You can resize the image to fit within a specific window size. This approach ensures the entire image is visible within the display window.\n\n   ```python\n   import cv2 as cv\n\n   imgFile = cv.imread('1.jpg')\n   \n   # Resize the image to fit the screen or a preferred size\n   width, height = 800, 600  # Example dimensions\n   resized_img = cv.resize(imgFile, (width, height))\n\n   cv.imshow('dst_rt', resized_img)\n   cv.waitKey(0)\n   cv.destroyAllWindows()\n   ```\n\n2. **Use a Resizable Window:**\n   You can make the window resizable so you can manually adjust it to fit the image.\n\n   ```python\n   import cv2 as cv\n\n   imgFile = cv.imread('1.jpg')\n   \n   # Create a resizable window\n   cv.namedWindow('dst_rt', cv.WINDOW_NORMAL)\n   \n   # Display the image\n   cv.imshow('dst_rt', imgFile)\n   cv.waitKey(0)\n   cv.destroyAllWindows()\n   ```\n\n3. **Automatically Resize the Window to Fit the Image:**\n   If you want the window to automatically adjust to the image size, ensure the window is set to resizable and adjust it programmatically if needed.\n\n   ```python\n   import cv2 as cv\n\n   imgFile = cv.imread('1.jpg')\n\n   # Create a resizable window\n   cv.namedWindow('dst_rt', cv.WINDOW_NORMAL)\n   \n   # Resize the window to the dimensions of the image\n   cv.resizeWindow('dst_rt', imgFile.shape[1], imgFile.shape[0])\n\n   cv.imshow('dst_rt', imgFile)\n   cv.waitKey(0)\n   cv.destroyAllWindows()\n   ```\n\nChoose the approach that best fits your needs. If the image is large and resizing it isn't an option, making the window resizable will allow you to adjust it manually."
