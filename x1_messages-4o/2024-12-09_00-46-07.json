        "content": "In Python, when you want to type-hint a file or file-like object, you can use the `IO` or `TextIO` type from the `typing` module, depending on whether the file is expected to handle binary or text data. \n\nFor your specific example, if the file is expected to be a text file, you would use `TextIO`. Here's how you can type-hint the return value of your function:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import TextIO\n\ndef foo() -> TextIO:\n    return open('bar', 'r')  # Assuming 'bar' is a text file\n```\n\nIf you're working with binary files, you would use `BinaryIO`:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import BinaryIO\n\ndef foo() -> BinaryIO:\n    return open('bar', 'rb')  # Assuming 'bar' is a binary file\n```\n\nIf you want to be more general and handle both text and binary files, you can use `IO`:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import IO\n\ndef foo() -> IO:\n    return open('bar', 'r')  # or 'rb', depending on the context\n```\n\nThese type hints help convey what kind of file object is being returned, which can be useful for documentation and static analysis tools."
