Let's break it down:\n\n- \\(1^2 = 1\\)\n- \\(2^2 = 4\\)\n- \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n- \\(4^2 = 16\\)\n- \\(5^2 = 25\\)\n- \\(6^2 = 36\\)\n- \\(7^2 = 49\\)\n\nAs you can see, the sequence follows the pattern of \\(n^2\\) where \\(n\\) is a natural number. So, the missing number in the sequence is \\(6^2 = 36\\). Therefore, the sequence is 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49."
