        "content": "I am currently using Python 2.5 and I want to enumerate a range of numbers starting at 1. For example, the desired output would be `[(1, 2000), (2, 2001), (3, 2002), (4, 2003), (5, 2004)]`. I know in Python 2.6 you can achieve this by using the code `h = enumerate(range(2000, 2005), 1)`. However, in Python 2.5 this method doesn't work and instead gives me the output `[(0, 2000), (1, 2001), (2, 2002), (3, 2003), (4, 2004)]` when I use the code \n```\nh = enumerate(range(2000, 2005))\n[x for x in h]\n```\nCan anyone provide a solution that helps me get the desired result in Python 2.5?"

        "content": "In Python 2.5, the `enumerate` function does not support a starting index as an argument, which is why you're seeing the default behavior of starting from 0. To achieve your desired output starting from 1, you can manually adjust the index in a list comprehension. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nh = [(i + 1, number) for i, number in enumerate(range(2000, 2005))]\nprint(h)\n```\n\nThis will give you the desired output:\n\n```\n[(1, 2000), (2, 2001), (3, 2002), (4, 2003), (5, 2004)]\n```\n\nIn this code, `enumerate(range(2000, 2005))` generates pairs of index and number starting from 0, and by adding 1 to the index `i`, you effectively start the enumeration from 1."
