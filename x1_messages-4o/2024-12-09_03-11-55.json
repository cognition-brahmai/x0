        "content": "The error you are encountering is due to the absence of the `curses` module, which is used by the `blessings` library. The `curses` module is typically available on Unix-based systems, but it is not natively available on Windows. However, you can resolve this issue by using an alternative library that provides similar functionality for Windows.\n\nHere's how you can work around this issue:\n\n1. **Use `windows-curses` Library**:\n   The `windows-curses` package provides a version of the `curses` library for Windows. You can install it via pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install windows-curses\n   ```\n\n   Once installed, try running your script again. This package should provide the necessary bindings for `curses` to work on Windows.\n\n2. **Alternative Libraries**:\n   If you continue to face issues, you might consider using an alternative library that doesn't depend on `curses`. One such alternative is `colorama`, which can handle cross-platform colored terminal text:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install colorama\n   ```\n\n   Here's an example of how you can use `colorama` to achieve similar effects:\n\n   ```python\n   from colorama import init, Fore, Style\n\n   # Initialize colorama\n   init()\n\n   print(Style.BRIGHT + 'Hi there!')\n   print(Fore.RED + Style.BRIGHT + 'It hurts my eyes!' + Style.RESET_ALL)\n\n   # Note: colorama does not support terminal location\n   print('This is at the bottom.')\n   ```\n\n3. **Modify Your Code**:\n   If you choose to use `colorama`, you will need to adjust your code as shown above since `colorama` doesn't support cursor movement like `curses` or `blessings`.\n\nBy using `windows-curses` or switching to `colorama`, you should be able to run your script successfully on Windows without encountering the `_curses` import error."
