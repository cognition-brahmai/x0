Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nj = [4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 3, 7, 5]\nnew_list = [x for x in j if x >= 5]\nprint(new_list)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\n[5, 6, 7, 7, 5]\n```\n\nThis code iterates over each element `x` in the list `j` and includes `x` in `new_list` only if `x` is greater than or equal to 5."
