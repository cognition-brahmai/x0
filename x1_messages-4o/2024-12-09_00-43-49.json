When I plot this data as a line plot, it works fine, but I run into issues when attempting to plot as a scatter plot. The error message I receive is `TypeError: ufunc 'sqrt' not supported for the input types, and the inputs could not be safely coerced to any supported types according to the casting rule ''safe''`. Could someone explain what this error message means and provide a solution to plot the data as a scatter plot in Matplotlib?\n\nHere is the code I'm working with:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ny = [7316.0, 7453.25, 7518.25, 7711.5, 7448.0, 7210.25, 7416.75, 6960.75, \n     7397.75, 6397.5, 5522.75, 5139.0, 5034.75, 4264.75, 5106.0, 3489.5, \n     4712.0, 4770.0]\nx = np.arange(0,18,1)\n\nplt.rcParams['legend.loc'] = 'best'\nplt.figure(1)\nplt.xlim(0, 20)\nplt.ylim(0, 10000)\nplt.scatter(x, y, 'r')\nplt.show()\n```"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering is due to the incorrect usage of the `plt.scatter()` function. The issue arises from the way the color is specified; it should be passed as a keyword argument, not directly as a positional argument after the data.\n\nIn the `plt.scatter()` function, the third argument is actually interpreted as the size of the markers, not the color. When you pass `'r'` as a third positional argument, it causes confusion because it expects a numerical value for marker size. Let's fix this by specifying the color as a keyword argument:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ny = [7316.0, 7453.25, 7518.25, 7711.5, 7448.0, 7210.25, 7416.75, 6960.75, \n     7397.75, 6397.5, 5522.75, 5139.0, 5034.75, 4264.75, 5106.0, 3489.5, \n     4712.0, 4770.0]\nx = np.arange(0, 18, 1)\n\nplt.rcParams['legend.loc'] = 'best'\nplt.figure(1)\nplt.xlim(0, 20)\nplt.ylim(0, 10000)\n\n# Corrected the scatter function call\nplt.scatter(x, y, c='r')\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `plt.scatter(x, y, c='r')`: Here, `x` and `y` are your data points, and `c='r'` specifies that the color of the markers should be red.\n\nThis change should resolve the error, and you'll be able to see your scatter plot without any issues."
