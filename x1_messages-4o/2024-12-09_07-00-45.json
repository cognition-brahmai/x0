        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the lack of a graphical display environment on your server, which is required by the Tkinter backend in Matplotlib to render plots. However, you can still generate charts and graphs in a non-interactive way by saving them to files. Here\u2019s how you can modify your script to save the plots as image files (e.g., PNG) instead of displaying them:\n\n1. **Switch to a Non-GUI Backend**: Use a backend that does not require a display, such as `Agg`.\n\n2. **Save the Plot to a File**: Use `plt.savefig()` to save the plot to a file instead of displaying it.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify your script:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib\nmatplotlib.use('Agg')  # Use the Agg backend for non-interactive plotting\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Your existing code...\n\ndef plot_stuff(inputs, outputs, losses, net_func, n_hidden):\n    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 6))\n    \n    # Your existing plotting code...\n\n    # Instead of plt.show(), use plt.savefig()\n    plt.savefig('output_plot.png')  # Save the plot to a file\n    print(\"Plot saved as 'output_plot.png'\")\n\n# Rest of your code...\n```\n\nAfter running your script, you should find an image file named `output_plot.png` in your working directory. You can then transfer this file to a machine with a graphical interface to view it.\n\nIf you need to view the plot directly on your server, you can use tools like `scp` to transfer the file to your local machine or use image viewers that can run in terminal environments like `fim` or `feh`, if they are available on your server."
