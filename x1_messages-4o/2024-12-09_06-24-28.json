I came across a post which suggests a solution using regex, however, I'm not sure how to implement it. In my function `mapfn(k, v)`, I want to apply the regex pattern to the incoming string (a line of a book) `v` to retrieve a new line without any non-alphanumeric characters. How can I effectively use the `re` library to achieve this?\n\nHere is my current code:\n\n```python\ndef mapfn(k, v):\n    print v\n    import re, string \n    pattern = re.compile('[\\W_]+')\n    v = pattern.match(v)\n    print v\n    for w in v.split():\n        yield w, 1\n```"

        "content": "To handle non-alphanumeric characters in your `mapfn` function, you can utilize Python\u2019s `re` library to remove these characters effectively. Your current approach uses `re.compile` and `pattern.match`, which isn't suitable for this task because `match` checks for a match only at the beginning of the string. Instead, you should use `re.sub` to replace non-alphanumeric characters. Here\u2019s how you can modify your `mapfn` function:\n\n```python\ndef mapfn(k, v):\n    import re\n    # Use re.sub to replace non-alphanumeric characters with a space\n    # \\W matches any non-word character; the underscore _ is added to match and remove underscores as well\n    v_cleaned = re.sub(r'[\\W_]+', ' ', v)\n    print(v_cleaned)\n    \n    # Split the cleaned line into words\n    for w in v_cleaned.split():\n        yield w, 1\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`re.sub(r'[\\W_]+', ' ', v)`**: This line uses a regular expression to replace every sequence of non-alphanumeric characters (including underscores) with a space. `\\W` matches any character that is not a word character (equivalent to `[^\\w]`), and `+` ensures that sequences of these characters are replaced with a single space.\n- **`v_cleaned.split()`**: This splits the cleaned string into words based on spaces.\n\nThis function will now correctly clean each line of input, removing unwanted characters before splitting it into words. Each word is then yielded along with the count `1`, which is typical in a word count MapReduce program."
