Even when I try to upgrade chardet using pip, or remove and reinstall python-chardet and its dependencies, I still face the same issue. The relevant lines in the `requests/__init__.py` file seem to indicate that the required versions are: urllib3 >= 1.21.1, <= 1.22 and chardet >= 3.0.2, < 3.1.0. However, my current versions are urllib3 1.9.1 and chardet 2.3.0. I also tried the same process for `python-pip` but to no avail. Could you provide any guidance on how to resolve this issue?"

        "content": "To resolve the `RequestsDependencyWarning` caused by incompatible versions of `urllib3` and `chardet`, you'll need to upgrade these packages to match the required versions specified by the `requests` library. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Upgrade `urllib3` and `chardet` Directly:**\n\n   You can upgrade both `urllib3` and `chardet` to compatible versions using pip. Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following commands:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade urllib3\n   pip install --upgrade chardet\n   ```\n\n   If you want to specify the versions more explicitly, you can do so:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install urllib3==1.22\n   pip install chardet==3.0.4\n   ```\n\n2. **Check for Conflicts:**\n\n   Sometimes, other packages might have dependencies that conflict with these versions. To get a list of installed packages and their versions, you can use:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip list\n   ```\n\n   If you find any package that depends on an older version of `urllib3` or `chardet`, try to upgrade or reinstall it.\n\n3. **Ensure `pip` is Up-to-date:**\n\n   Make sure that `pip` itself is up-to-date, which can also help resolve dependency issues:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n   ```\n\n4. **Create a Virtual Environment:**\n\n   If upgrading packages globally is causing issues, consider using a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\\Scripts\\activate`\n   ```\n\n   Then, upgrade the packages within this environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests\n   pip install urllib3==1.22\n   pip install chardet==3.0.4\n   ```\n\n5. **Reinstall Requests:**\n\n   If the problem persists, try reinstalling the `requests` package:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall requests\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `RequestsDependencyWarning` and ensure that the versions of `urllib3` and `chardet` are compatible with the `requests` library."
