        "content": "Your rearrangement of the sentence into active voice is correct. The active voice sentence is: \"The children captured the dogs.\"\n\nIn Go, if you were looking to work with strings and rearrange such a sentence programmatically, you might want to manipulate strings or use a function to transform it. However, the rearrangement itself is more of a linguistic transformation rather than a programming task. Here's a simple Go example that demonstrates how you might handle strings, though it doesn't automatically convert passive to active voice:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"strings\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Original sentence\n\tpassive := \"The dogs were captured by the children.\"\n\n\t// Active sentence\n\tactive := \"The children captured the dogs.\"\n\n\t// Print both for comparison\n\tfmt.Println(\"Passive voice:\", passive)\n\tfmt.Println(\"Active voice:\", active)\n\n\t// Simulate rearranging by splitting and joining (for demonstration purposes)\n\twords := strings.Split(passive, \" \")\n\tif words[0] == \"The\" && words[2] == \"were\" && words[3] == \"captured\" {\n\t\t// Simple manual rearrangement\n\t\trearranged := fmt.Sprintf(\"The %s captured the %s.\", words[5], words[1])\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Rearranged active voice:\", rearranged)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThis code example demonstrates the manual approach to constructing an active voice sentence from a known passive voice pattern. Of course, transforming sentences programmatically into active voice in general would require natural language processing capabilities beyond basic string manipulation."
