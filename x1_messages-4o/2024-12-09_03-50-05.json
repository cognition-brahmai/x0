In this dataframe, I have a column named 'housing' which contains binary answers in the form of 'yes' or 'no' strings. I want to convert these strings into integers, where 'yes' turns into 1 and 'no' turns into 0. The first 10 values of this column look like this:\n\n```python\nIn [13]: sampleDF.housing[0:10]\nOut[13]:\n0     no\n1     no\n2    yes\n3     no\n4     no\n5     no\n6     no\n7     no\n8    yes\n9    yes\nName: housing, dtype: object\n```\n\nWhat is a simple way to change this 'yes'/'no' column to '1'/'0' in a pandas dataframe?"

        "content": "You can easily convert the 'yes'/'no' strings to '1'/'0' integers in a pandas DataFrame using the `map` function. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming sampleDF is your DataFrame\nsampleDF['housing'] = sampleDF['housing'].map({'yes': 1, 'no': 0})\n\n# Now, the 'housing' column will contain integers\nprint(sampleDF['housing'][0:10])\n```\n\nThis code snippet will map the values in the 'housing' column from 'yes' to 1 and 'no' to 0, effectively converting your column to integers. The `map` function is quite efficient for this kind of transformation."
