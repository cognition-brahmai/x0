        "content": "The `SyntaxError: invalid syntax` you are encountering is likely due to the incorrect handling of quotes in your SQL query within the Python code. Specifically, the issue arises from how you are using single quotes inside a string that is also enclosed in single quotes. Here's how you can fix it:\n\n1. Use triple quotes (`'''` or `\"\"\"`) to enclose your SQL query string, which allows you to use single quotes inside the query without causing a syntax error.\n2. Ensure proper spacing and syntax in your SQL query.\n\nHere's a corrected version of your Python code:\n\n```python\nimport cx_Oracle\nimport pandas as pd\n\nip = 'XX.XX.X.XXX'\nport = YYYY\nSID = 'DW'\ndsn_tns = cx_Oracle.makedsn(ip, port, SID)\n\nconnection = cx_Oracle.connect('BA', 'PASSWORD', dsn_tns)\n\nquery = \"\"\"\nSELECT * \nFROM TRANSACTION\nWHERE DIA_DAT >= to_date('15.02.28 00:00:00', 'YY.MM.DD HH24:MI:SS')\nAND (locations <> 'PUERTO RICO' OR locations <> 'JAPAN')\nAND CITY = 'LONDON'\n\"\"\"\n\ndf_ora = pd.read_sql(query, con=connection)\n```\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- Ensure that the `cx_Oracle` library is properly installed and configured in your Python environment.\n- Double-check the database connection details such as IP, port, SID, username, and password.\n- Ensure that the Oracle environment variables are correctly set up, especially if you are running this code outside of a direct Oracle client environment.\n\nThis should resolve the `SyntaxError` issue and allow you to successfully execute your query."
