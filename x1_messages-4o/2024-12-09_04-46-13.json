        "content": "In Python, I am working with a code base that contains several classes where instance attributes reflect values stored in a database. I have refactored many of these attributes to have their database lookups deferred, meaning they are not initialized in the constructor but only upon the first read. These attributes do not change over the lifetime of the instance, but they take significant time to calculate initially and are only really accessed for special cases. Therefore, they can also be cached after they've been retrieved from the database. I find myself repeatedly typing the following snippet of code for various attributes across different classes:\n\n```\nclass testA(object):\n\n  def __init__(self):\n    self._a = None\n    self._b = None\n\n  @property\n  def a(self):\n    if self._a is None:\n      # Calculate the attribute now\n      self._a = 7\n    return self._a\n\n  @property\n  def b(self):\n    #etc\n```\n\nIs there an existing decorator in Python that can achieve this? Or, can a decorator be defined in a reasonably simple way to perform this task? I'm currently using Python 2.5, but I'm also interested in solutions for Python 2.6 if they differ significantly."

        "content": "In Python, especially when working with deferred initialization and caching of attributes, the pattern you're using is quite common. The good news is that you can create a custom decorator to handle this pattern, which will simplify your code and reduce repetition. This is especially useful in Python 2.5 and 2.6 where some modern conveniences like `functools.lru_cache` (introduced in Python 3.2) are not available.\n\nHere is how you can define a custom decorator to handle lazy evaluation and caching of attributes:\n\n```python\nclass lazy_property(object):\n    def __init__(self, function):\n        self.function = function\n        self.attr_name = '_lazy_' + function.__name__\n\n    def __get__(self, obj, cls):\n        if obj is None:\n            return self\n        if not hasattr(obj, self.attr_name):\n            setattr(obj, self.attr_name, self.function(obj))\n        return getattr(obj, self.attr_name)\n\n# Example usage\nclass TestA(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass  # No need to initialize _a or _b here\n\n    @lazy_property\n    def a(self):\n        # Simulates a heavy computation or database lookup\n        print(\"Calculating 'a'...\")\n        return 7\n\n    @lazy_property\n    def b(self):\n        # Simulates another heavy computation or database lookup\n        print(\"Calculating 'b'...\")\n        return 42\n\n# Testing the implementation\ntest_instance = TestA()\nprint(test_instance.a)  # This will calculate 'a' and print \"Calculating 'a'...\"\nprint(test_instance.a)  # This will use the cached value and not print anything\nprint(test_instance.b)  # This will calculate 'b' and print \"Calculating 'b'...\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **`lazy_property` Decorator**: This decorator is used to define properties that are computed once upon first access and then cached for subsequent accesses. It makes use of the descriptor protocol in Python.\n\n- **Initialization**: The `lazy_property` class is initialized with the function (property method) it decorates. It also creates a unique attribute name to store the cached result.\n\n- **`__get__` Method**: This method is part of the descriptor protocol. It checks if the cached value already exists. If it doesn't, it calculates it by calling the decorated function and stores it in the instance.\n\n- **Usage**: You decorate methods with `@lazy_property` instead of `@property`. The decorated method should contain the logic to compute the attribute's value.\n\nThis solution should work for both Python 2.5 and 2.6, providing a neat and reusable way to handle lazy-loaded, cached attributes."
