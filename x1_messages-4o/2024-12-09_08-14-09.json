Now, whenever I try to use `pip` or `conda` installs, I get the error message: \"zsh: command not found: conda\". I am using ZSH version 5.0.5. I have also added the following line to my `zshenv.sh` file: \"export PATH =\"/Users/Dz/anaconda/bin:$PATH\"\". What could be causing this issue and how can I resolve it?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is likely due to incorrect syntax in your `zshenv.sh` file. The spaces around the `=` in your `export` statement are causing the PATH to not be set correctly. Here's how you can resolve it:\n\n1. **Edit the `zshenv.sh` file:**\n\n   Open your `zshenv.sh` file in a text editor and correct the `export` statement to remove the spaces around the `=` sign. It should look like this:\n\n   ```sh\n   export PATH=\"/Users/Dz/anaconda/bin:$PATH\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Source the file:**\n\n   After making the change, you need to source the file to ensure the changes take effect. You can do this by executing the following command in the terminal:\n\n   ```sh\n   source ~/.zshenv\n   ```\n\n3. **Restart the terminal:**\n\n   Close the terminal and open it again to ensure that the changes have been applied.\n\n4. **Verify the PATH:**\n\n   To verify that the PATH has been set correctly, you can run:\n\n   ```sh\n   echo $PATH\n   ```\n\n   Ensure that `/Users/Dz/anaconda/bin` is listed in the output.\n\n5. **Check for conda initialization:**\n\n   Make sure that conda is correctly initialized for zsh. You can do this by running:\n\n   ```sh\n   conda init zsh\n   ```\n\n   This command will modify your `.zshrc` file to ensure that conda is initialized when you start a new shell.\n\n6. **Restart the terminal again:**\n\n   After running `conda init zsh`, close and reopen your terminal once more to ensure everything is properly set up.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"command not found\" error and use `conda` and `pip` as expected in your zsh environment."
