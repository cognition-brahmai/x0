To create a SQL query that lists products with a price greater than $50, you'll need to have a table that contains product information, including a column for the price. Let's assume your table is named `products` and the column for the price is named `price`. The SQL query would look like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM products\nWHERE price > 50;\n```\n\nThis query selects all columns (`*`) from the `products` table where the `price` is greater than $50. If you only want to select specific columns, you can replace `*` with the column names you are interested in, like `product_id`, `product_name`, etc."
