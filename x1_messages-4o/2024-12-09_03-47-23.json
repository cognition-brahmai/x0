        "content": "In Python, you can create static class variables and methods using the `@staticmethod` decorator for methods and simply assigning variables at the class level for static variables. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Static Class Variables\n\nStatic class variables are shared among all instances of the class. You can define a static class variable by simply declaring it within the class body, but outside of any instance methods.\n\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n    # This is a static class variable\n    static_variable = \"I am static\"\n\n    def __init__(self, instance_variable):\n        self.instance_variable = instance_variable\n\n# Accessing static class variable\nprint(MyClass.static_variable)  # Output: I am static\n\n# You can also access it through an instance, but it's not recommended\ninstance = MyClass(\"Instance Variable\")\nprint(instance.static_variable)  # Output: I am static\n```\n\n### Static Methods\n\nStatic methods don\u2019t modify object state and are not dependent on instance variables. They are defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator and do not take the `self` parameter.\n\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n    @staticmethod\n    def static_method():\n        print(\"This is a static method.\")\n\n# Calling the static method\nMyClass.static_method()  # Output: This is a static method.\n\n# You can also call it through an instance, but it's not recommended\ninstance = MyClass()\ninstance.static_method()  # Output: This is a static method.\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Static Variables**: Defined at the class level and are shared among all instances.\n- **Static Methods**: Defined with `@staticmethod` and do not access or modify instance-level data.\n\nThese tools help in structuring the code in a way where certain functions or variables are bound to the class rather than any instance of the class."
