The color could be in different formats such as a string like 'k', an RGB tuple like (0.5, 0.1, 0.8), or a hexadecimal like '#05FA2B'. I am hoping for a Matplotlib function similar to `matplotlib.pyplot.darken(c, 0.1)` that would modify the color by converting it to HSL, and then either multiplying the L value by a given factor or setting the L value to a specific value. The L value should be floored at 0 and capped at 1, and the function should return the modified color."

        "content": "To achieve the effect of darkening or lightening a color in Matplotlib, you can create a custom function that converts the color to the HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) color space, modifies the lightness, and then converts it back to RGB. Unfortunately, Matplotlib does not have a built-in function exactly like `matplotlib.pyplot.darken()`, but you can use the `colorsys` module to manipulate the color in HSL space. Here's how you can implement such a function:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.colors as mcolors\nimport colorsys\n\ndef adjust_lightness(color, factor):\n    \"\"\"\n    Darken or lighten the given color by the specified factor.\n    A factor < 1 will darken the color, while a factor > 1 will lighten it.\n\n    Parameters:\n        color (str or tuple): The color to adjust, specified as a string or an RGB tuple.\n        factor (float): The factor by which to adjust the color's lightness.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: The modified RGB color.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the color to an RGB tuple\n    rgb = mcolors.to_rgb(color)\n    \n    # Convert RGB to HLS\n    h, l, s = colorsys.rgb_to_hls(*rgb)\n    \n    # Adjust the lightness\n    l = max(0, min(1, l * factor))\n    \n    # Convert back to RGB\n    new_rgb = colorsys.hls_to_rgb(h, l, s)\n    \n    return new_rgb\n\n# Example usage\noriginal_color = '#05FA2B'\ndarkened_color = adjust_lightness(original_color, 0.8)  # Darken by 20%\nlightened_color = adjust_lightness(original_color, 1.2) # Lighten by 20%\n\nprint(\"Original:\", original_color)\nprint(\"Darkened:\", darkened_color)\nprint(\"Lightened:\", lightened_color)\n```\n\nThis function `adjust_lightness()` takes a color and a factor. If the factor is less than 1, it darkens the color; if greater than 1, it lightens the color. It uses `matplotlib.colors.to_rgb()` to ensure the input color is converted to an RGB tuple, and then it performs the manipulation in the HSL color space using the `colorsys` module. The resulting RGB color is returned as a tuple."
