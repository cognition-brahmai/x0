        "content": "The error message you're encountering indicates that the `pdf2image` library is unable to find the `poppler` utilities, which are required to convert PDF files to images. This is a common issue when working with PDF conversions in Python. To resolve this, you'll need to install `poppler` and ensure that its binaries are accessible via your system's PATH. Here's how you can do that:\n\n### Installing Poppler on Windows\n\n1. **Download Poppler for Windows**:\n   - Go to [Poppler for Windows](http://blog.alivate.com.au/poppler-windows/) and download the latest binary release.\n   - Alternatively, you can download from [poppler-win32](https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases/) or [poppler-win64](https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases/) depending on your system architecture.\n\n2. **Extract the Download**:\n   - Extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP file to a directory of your choice. For example, `C:\\poppler-xx\\` (replace `xx` with the version number).\n\n3. **Add Poppler to PATH**:\n   - Open the Start menu, search for \"Environment Variables\" and select \"Edit the system environment variables\".\n   - In the System Properties window, click on \"Environment Variables\".\n   - Under \"System variables\", find the \"Path\" variable and click \"Edit\".\n   - Click \"New\" and add the path to the `bin` directory of the extracted Poppler folder (e.g., `C:\\poppler-xx\\bin`).\n   - Click \"OK\" to close all dialogs.\n\n4. **Verify Installation**:\n   - Open a new Command Prompt window and type `pdfinfo` to verify that the command is recognized. You should see the version information, which confirms that Poppler is correctly installed and in your PATH.\n\n### Update Your Python Code\n\nOnce Poppler is installed and configured correctly, you should be able to run your Python script without encountering the \"Unable to get page count\" error. If you still encounter issues, double-check that the path to Poppler's `bin` directory is correctly set in the PATH environment variable.\n\nAdditionally, ensure that your Python script is using the correct path for PDF files and any other dependencies needed for your `pdf2image` conversion process.\n\nWith these steps, your `pdf2image` library should be able to locate Poppler, and the conversion should work as expected. If you encounter any further issues, feel free to ask for more assistance!"
