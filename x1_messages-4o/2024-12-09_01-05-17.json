I have a class \"Patient\", as shown below:\n\n```python\nclass Patient(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'patients'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, nullable=False)\n    mother_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('patients.id'), index=True)\n    mother = relationship('Patient', primaryjoin='Patient.id==Patient.mother_id', remote_side='Patient.id', uselist=False)\n    phenoscore = Column(Float)\n```\n\nMy goal is to query all patients whose mother's phenoscore is equal to 10. I tried the following code:\n\n```python\npatients = Patient.query.filter(Patient.mother.phenoscore == 10)\n```\n\nBut it doesn't seem to work. I can access `.mother.phenoscore` for each element when outputting, however, this code doesn't seem to do it. Is there a way to filter by an attribute of a relationship without writing the SQL Statement, or an extra join-statement?"

        "content": "To filter patients based on the `phenoscore` of their mother using SQLAlchemy, you need to perform a join in your query. Although you've mentioned that you want to avoid explicitly writing a join, leveraging SQLAlchemy's ORM is a clean and efficient way to do this. Here's how you can achieve it:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import aliased\n\n# Create an alias for the Patient table to represent the mother\nMother = aliased(Patient)\n\n# Query to filter patients whose mother's phenoscore is 10\npatients = (\n    session.query(Patient)\n    .join(Mother, Patient.mother_id == Mother.id)\n    .filter(Mother.phenoscore == 10)\n    .all()\n)\n\n# 'session' should be your SQLAlchemy session object\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Aliased Table**: The `aliased` function is used to create an alias for the `Patient` table. This is necessary because you're essentially querying the same table twice \u2014 once for the patient and once for the mother.\n\n2. **Join**: The `join` function is used to perform an inner join between the `Patient` table and its alias `Mother`, linking them through the `mother_id`.\n\n3. **Filter**: The `filter` function applies the condition on the `phenoscore` of the `Mother` alias.\n\nThis approach leverages SQLAlchemy's ORM to handle the join implicitly, allowing you to filter based on related table attributes without directly writing SQL or using explicit join statements."
