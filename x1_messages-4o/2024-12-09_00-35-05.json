I have been using the `OneHotEncoder` function from sklearn library for this transformation. However, I am encountering a depreciation message suggesting to use `categories='auto'`. When I tried to use `categories='auto'`, the transformation was applied to all independent columns rather than just the country column. How can I apply the transformation only to the 0th column (Country) of my dataset?"

        "content": "To apply the `OneHotEncoder` transformation to only the specific column (such as the \"Country\" column) in your dataset, you can use the `ColumnTransformer` from `sklearn.compose`. The `ColumnTransformer` allows you to specify which transformer to apply to which column. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Suppose this is your dataset\ndata = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Country': ['France', 'Spain', 'Germany', 'Spain', 'Germany', 'France', 'Spain'],\n    'Age': [44, 27, 30, 38, 40, 35, 38],\n    'Salary': [72000, 48000, 54000, 61000, 64000, 58000, 52000]\n})\n\n# Define the column transformer\ncolumn_transformer = ColumnTransformer(\n    transformers=[\n        ('country_ohe', OneHotEncoder(categories='auto'), [0])  # Apply OneHotEncoder to the 0th column\n    ],\n    remainder='passthrough'  # Keep the rest of the columns unchanged\n)\n\n# Transform the dataset\ntransformed_data = column_transformer.fit_transform(data)\n\n# Convert the result back to a DataFrame for better visualization\n# The transformed columns will be at the beginning, followed by the untouched columns\ncolumn_names = (\n    column_transformer.named_transformers_['country_ohe']\n    .get_feature_names_out(['Country'])\n    .tolist() + ['Age', 'Salary']\n)\n\ntransformed_df = pd.DataFrame(transformed_data, columns=column_names)\n\nprint(transformed_df)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **ColumnTransformer**: It allows you to apply different transformations to different columns of your data.\n- **OneHotEncoder**: We are applying this encoder only to the \"Country\" column (the 0th column in the dataset) by specifying `[0]` in the `ColumnTransformer`.\n- **remainder='passthrough'**: This ensures that all columns not explicitly transformed (i.e., \"Age\" and \"Salary\") remain unchanged in the output.\n- **get_feature_names_out**: This method from `OneHotEncoder` is used to get the names of the output features, which helps in creating the new DataFrame with appropriate column names.\n\nThis approach should resolve the issue you're experiencing and apply the transformation only to the desired column."
