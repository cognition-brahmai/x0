I tried various options such as `df.resample('Min')` and `df.groupby(date_range(datetime(2012,1,1,12, 30), freq='Min', periods=4))`, but either they are too high level and want to aggregate, or they fail with an exception. I also tried `df.groupby(TimeGrouper(freq='Min'))` which works fine, but the `TimeGrouper` class is not documented. What is the correct way to group by a period of time and how can I group the data by a minute AND by the Source column?\n\nHere is my data:\n\n```\ndef gen(date, count=10):\n     while count > 0:\n         yield date, \"event{}\".format(randint(1,9)), \"source{}\".format(randint(1,3))\n         count -= 1\n         date += DateOffset(seconds=randint(40))\n\ndf = DataFrame.from_records(list(gen(datetime(2012,1,1,12, 30))), index='Time', columns=['Time', 'Event', 'Source'])\n```\n\nAnd the DataFrame 'df' is:\n\n```\n                     Event  Source\n2012-01-01 12:30:00     event3  source1\n2012-01-01 12:30:12     event2  source2\n2012-01-01 12:30:12     event2  source2\n2012-01-01 12:30:29     event6  source1\n2012-01-01 12:30:38     event1  source1\n2012-01-01 12:31:05     event4  source2\n2012-01-01 12:31:38     event4  source1\n2012-01-01 12:31:44     event5  source1\n2012-01-01 12:31:48     event5  source2\n2012-01-01 12:32:23     event6  source1\n```"

        "content": "To group your DataFrame by a specific period of time, such as a minute, and also by another column (like 'Source'), you can use the `pd.Grouper` function along with `groupby`. The `pd.Grouper` allows you to specify the frequency for time-based grouping, and you can combine this with grouping by another column.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom pandas import DateOffset\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom random import randint\n\n# Generate the data\ndef gen(date, count=10):\n    while count > 0:\n        yield date, \"event{}\".format(randint(1, 9)), \"source{}\".format(randint(1, 3))\n        count -= 1\n        date += DateOffset(seconds=randint(40))\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame.from_records(\n    list(gen(datetime(2012, 1, 1, 12, 30))),\n    index='Time',\n    columns=['Time', 'Event', 'Source']\n)\n\n# Group by minute and by 'Source'\ngrouped = df.groupby([pd.Grouper(freq='Min', level='Time'), 'Source'])\n\n# If you want to see the grouped data, you can iterate over it\nfor name, group in grouped:\n    print(f\"Group: {name}\")\n    print(group)\n    print()\n\n# To perform aggregation, for example, counting the number of events per group\ngrouped_counts = grouped.size().reset_index(name='Counts')\nprint(grouped_counts)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`pd.Grouper(freq='Min', level='Time')`**: This creates a Grouper object that groups by minute using the 'Time' index.\n- **`groupby([pd.Grouper(...), 'Source'])`**: Combines the time-based grouping with additional grouping by the 'Source' column.\n- The `grouped` object is a `DataFrameGroupBy` object that you can iterate over or perform aggregations on.\n- **`grouped.size().reset_index(name='Counts')`**: This aggregates the groups by counting the number of entries in each group and resets the index to turn it into a DataFrame.\n\nThis will give you the desired grouping by both time period (minute) and the 'Source' column. You can then perform any aggregation or analysis you need on this grouped data."
