I have a function that takes a numeric type as an input parameter, and it is supposed to work with integers, floats, and complex numbers. I am looking for a basic type that I can use for type hinting. Furthermore, I need to use this in a collection type parameter. Here is an example of the function:\n\n```python\ndef foo(a):\n    return ((a+1)*2)**4;\n```\n\nI want to modify it to something like:\n\n```python\ndef foo(a: numeric):\n    return ((a+1)*2)**4;\n```\n\nand in a collection:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Collection;\ndef foo(_in: Collection[numeric]):\n    return ((_in[0]+_in[1])*2)**4;\n```"

        "content": "To type hint a generic numeric type in Python that encompasses integers, floats, and complex numbers, you can use the `numbers` module, which provides a hierarchy of numeric abstract base classes. Specifically, you can use `numbers.Complex`, which serves as a base for all numeric types, including integers, floats, and complex numbers. Here's how you can modify your function with appropriate type hints:\n\n1. For a single numeric input:\n\n```python\nfrom numbers import Complex\n\ndef foo(a: Complex) -> Complex:\n    return ((a + 1) * 2) ** 4\n```\n\n2. For a collection of numeric values:\n\n```python\nfrom numbers import Complex\nfrom typing import Collection\n\ndef foo(_in: Collection[Complex]) -> Complex:\n    return ((_in[0] + _in[1]) * 2) ** 4\n```\n\nIn the above code:\n\n- `Complex` is used as a type hint to indicate that `a` can be an integer, float, or complex number.\n- `Collection[Complex]` is used to type hint a collection containing numeric types. Note that `Collection` is a more general type, and if you have a specific type of collection in mind (like a list or tuple), you could use `List[Complex]` or `Tuple[Complex, ...]` instead.\n\nThese type hints will help in static type checking and make it clear what types your function is designed to handle."
