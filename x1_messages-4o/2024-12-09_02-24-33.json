However, I want to know if there is a way to add a custom method that can be chained to the end of a queryset from the model. Essentially, I want to add the custom method in such a way that I can execute commands like 'Transaction.objects.filter(...).reasonably_complex_filter()'. Can you help me achieve this?\n\n<pre><code>\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass Transaction(models.Model):\n    ...\n\nclass TransactionManager(models.Manager):\n    def reasonably_complex_filter(self):\n        return self.get_query_set().filter(...)\n\nclass Transaction(models.Model):\n    objects = TransactionManager()\n</code></pre>"

        "content": "Certainly! In Django, you can achieve this by creating a custom `QuerySet` class and then using it in your custom `Manager`. By doing this, you can define custom methods on the `QuerySet` itself, allowing you to chain them in your queries. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n1. **Create a Custom QuerySet**: Define a custom `QuerySet` class with your custom method.\n\n2. **Use the Custom QuerySet in a Custom Manager**: Update your custom manager to use the custom `QuerySet`.\n\nHere's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass TransactionQuerySet(models.QuerySet):\n    def reasonably_complex_filter(self):\n        # Add your complex filter logic here\n        return self.filter(...)  # Replace '...' with your filter conditions\n\nclass TransactionManager(models.Manager):\n    def get_queryset(self):\n        # Use the custom QuerySet\n        return TransactionQuerySet(self.model, using=self._db)\n\n    def reasonably_complex_filter(self):\n        # Optionally, expose the custom method on the manager as well\n        return self.get_queryset().reasonably_complex_filter()\n\nclass Transaction(models.Model):\n    # Define your fields here\n    ...\n\n    objects = TransactionManager()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Custom QuerySet (`TransactionQuerySet`)**: This class extends `models.QuerySet` and contains the custom method `reasonably_complex_filter`. This method should include your filtering logic and return the filtered queryset.\n\n- **Custom Manager (`TransactionManager`)**: This manager overrides the `get_queryset` method to use your custom `TransactionQuerySet`. You can also optionally define the `reasonably_complex_filter` method on the manager to allow calling it directly on the manager, which internally calls the same method on the queryset.\n\n- **Model (`Transaction`)**: Assign your custom manager to the `objects` attribute of the model.\n\n### Usage:\n\nNow you can use your custom method as part of a query chain:\n\n```python\ntransactions = Transaction.objects.filter(...).reasonably_complex_filter()\n```\n\nThis approach keeps your filtering logic organized and reusable across different query chains."
