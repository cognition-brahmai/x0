How can I avoid this and only check if my 'Tocompare' time falls between 'start' and 'End' times?"

        "content": "To compare only the time portion of your strings without considering the date, you can use Python's `datetime.time` class. This allows you to focus solely on the time part. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Convert your time strings to `datetime.time` objects.\n2. Compare the `time` objects to determine if `Tocompare` falls between `start` and `End`.\n\nHere's a complete example:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, time\n\n# Define your time strings\nstart = \"22:00:00\"\nEnd = \"03:00:00\"\nTocompare = \"23:30:00\"\n\n# Convert to datetime.time objects\nstart_time = datetime.strptime(start, \"%H:%M:%S\").time()\nend_time = datetime.strptime(End, \"%H:%M:%S\").time()\nto_compare_time = datetime.strptime(Tocompare, \"%H:%M:%S\").time()\n\n# Function to check if a time is between two times\ndef is_time_between(start, end, check_time):\n    # Handle the case where the time spans midnight\n    if start <= end:\n        # Simple comparison for non-midnight spanning times\n        return start <= check_time <= end\n    else:\n        # Time spans midnight\n        return check_time >= start or check_time <= end\n\n# Check if Tocompare is between start and End\nis_in_range = is_time_between(start_time, end_time, to_compare_time)\n\nprint(f\"Does '{Tocompare}' fall between '{start}' and '{End}'? {is_in_range}\")\n```\n\nThis code handles the situation where the time period spans midnight, which is the case in your example where `start` is `22:00:00` and `End` is `03:00:00`. The function `is_time_between` checks for this special case and performs the appropriate comparison."
