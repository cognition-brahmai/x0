I want to narrow a query set for a form field that has a foreignkey to the User's table down to the group that a user belongs to. The groups have been previously associated by me. For instance, the model might have a ForeignKey like so:\n\n```python\nmyuser = models.ForeignKey(User)\n```\n\nAnd my ModelForm is very simple:\n\n```python\nclass MyForm(ModelForm):\n    class Meta:\n        model = MyModel\n```\n\nWhen I instantiate the form in my views.py, I do it like this:\n\n```python\nform = MyForm()\n```\n\nNow, how can I take the 'myuser' field, and filter it so only users of group 'foo' show up, something like: \n\n```python\nform.fields[\"myuser\"].queryset = ???\n```\n\nThe query in SQL looks like this:\n\n```sql\nmysql> SELECT * from auth_user INNER JOIN auth_user_groups ON auth_user.id = auth_user_groups.user_id INNER JOIN auth_group ON auth_group.id = auth_user_groups.group_id WHERE auth_group.name = 'client';\n```\n\nHowever, I want to avoid using raw SQL. Is it possible to do such a task?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this task using Django's ORM without resorting to raw SQL. You want to filter the queryset for the `myuser` field in your form to only include users who belong to a specific group, say 'foo'. Here\u2019s how you could do it:\n\nFirst, make sure you have imported the necessary models and forms in your `views.py` file:\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User, Group\nfrom .models import MyModel\nfrom .forms import MyForm\n```\n\nThen, when you instantiate the form, you can filter the `queryset` for the `myuser` field like this:\n\n```python\n# Retrieve the group you are interested in\ngroup_name = 'foo'\ngroup = Group.objects.get(name=group_name)\n\n# Filter the users who belong to this group\nusers_in_group = User.objects.filter(groups=group)\n\n# Instantiate the form and set the queryset for the 'myuser' field\nform = MyForm()\nform.fields['myuser'].queryset = users_in_group\n```\n\nThis code snippet retrieves the group named 'foo' from the `Group` model, filters the `User` model to get only those users who are in the specified group, and finally sets the `queryset` for the `myuser` field in your form to this filtered list of users.\n\nBy using Django's ORM, you avoid raw SQL and maintain the benefits of using a high-level abstraction that is more readable and maintainable."
