I have tried adding a 'Reply-to' parameter in the MIMEMultipart() like the following:\n\n```python\nmsg = MIMEMultipart()\nmsg['From'] = \"email@gmail.com\"\nmsg['To'] = to\nmsg['Subject'] = subject\nmsg['Reply-to'] = \"email2@example.com\"\n```\nBut this doesn't seem to work as I am unable to find any relevant information in the Python docs. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To set a different 'Reply-to' email address when sending an email using Python's `smtplib` and `email` libraries, you need to ensure that you are correctly setting the 'Reply-To' header in your email message. Your approach using `msg['Reply-to']` is mostly correct, but the header should be capitalized as 'Reply-To' rather than 'Reply-to'. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport smtplib\nfrom email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart\nfrom email.mime.text import MIMEText\n\n# Email details\nfrom_email = \"email@gmail.com\"\nto_email = \"recipient@example.com\"\nsubject = \"Your Subject Here\"\nreply_to_email = \"email2@example.com\"\nbody = \"This is the body of the email.\"\n\n# Create the email message\nmsg = MIMEMultipart()\nmsg['From'] = from_email\nmsg['To'] = to_email\nmsg['Subject'] = subject\nmsg['Reply-To'] = reply_to_email\n\n# Attach the email body\nmsg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))\n\n# Send the email\ntry:\n    # Connect to the Gmail SMTP server\n    server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)\n    server.starttls()\n    server.login(from_email, 'your_gmail_password')  # Use an app-specific password if you have 2FA enabled\n\n    # Send the email\n    server.send_message(msg)\n    print(\"Email sent successfully\")\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\nfinally:\n    server.quit()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Correct Header Name:** Make sure to use 'Reply-To' (with the correct capitalization) in your MIME message headers.\n2. **Gmail SMTP Settings:** Ensure that you are using the correct SMTP server settings. For Gmail, it's typically `smtp.gmail.com` with port `587` for TLS.\n3. **App-Specific Password:** If you have 2-Step Verification enabled on your Gmail account, you will need to generate an app-specific password to use instead of your regular password.\n4. **Error Handling:** Include appropriate error handling to catch any issues with the SMTP connection or sending process.\n\nBy setting the 'Reply-To' header, when the recipient hits 'Reply', their email client should automatically use the address specified in 'Reply-To' instead of the 'From' address."
