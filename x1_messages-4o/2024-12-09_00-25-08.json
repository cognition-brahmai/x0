Here\u2019s how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Download wkhtmltopdf:**\n   - Download the `wkhtmltopdf` installer for Windows from [the official site](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html).\n   - Choose the appropriate version for your system (32-bit or 64-bit).\n\n2. **Install wkhtmltopdf:**\n   - Run the installer and install `wkhtmltopdf` on your system.\n\n3. **Locate the Executable Path:**\n   - After installation, find the path where `wkhtmltopdf.exe` is installed. It is usually found in `C:\\Program Files\\wkhtmltopdf\\bin\\wkhtmltopdf.exe` or `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\wkhtmltopdf\\bin\\wkhtmltopdf.exe`.\n\n4. **Update Your Code:**\n   - Update your Python code to include the correct path to the `wkhtmltopdf.exe` executable in the `pdfkit.configuration` call.\n\nHere\u2019s an updated version of your code with the correct path:\n\n```python\nimport pdfkit\n\n# Update the path with the actual installation path of wkhtmltopdf.exe\npath_to_wkhtmltopdf = r'C:\\Program Files\\wkhtmltopdf\\bin\\wkhtmltopdf.exe'\n\nconfig = pdfkit.configuration(wkhtmltopdf=path_to_wkhtmltopdf)\npdfkit.from_url('http://google.com', 'out.pdf', configuration=config)\n```\n\n5. **Environment Variables (Optional):**\n   - Alternatively, you can add the path to `wkhtmltopdf.exe` to your system's PATH environment variable. This way, you won\u2019t need to specify the path in your code every time.\n   - To do this, search for \"Environment Variables\" in the Windows Start Menu, then edit the PATH variable to include the directory containing `wkhtmltopdf.exe`.\n\n6. **Run Your Script:**\n   - Now, try running your script again. It should be able to locate the `wkhtmltopdf` executable and generate the PDF without issues.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"No wkhtmltopdf executable found\" error and successfully create a PDF using `pdfkit` in Python."
