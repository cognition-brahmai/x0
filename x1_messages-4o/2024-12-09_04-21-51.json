I have a `tox.ini` configuration that works perfectly in running my Python unittests in several Python versions. However, I'm trying to setup a build in Travis-CI to automatically run this when I push changes to Github. I have a `.travis.yml` file, but it runs all my tests in each version of Python redundantly, causing the build that normally takes 5 minutes to take up 45 minutes instead. When I tried removing the python list from my yaml file, it results in my Python3.5 tests failing due to the 3.5 interpreter not being found, which seems to be a known limitation with Travis-CI. How can I find a workaround for this?"

        "content": "To efficiently use Tox with Travis-CI for testing multiple Python versions without redundancy, you can configure your `.travis.yml` file to leverage Tox's own environment management instead of specifying each Python version explicitly. Here's a step-by-step guide to set it up:\n\n1. **Specify a Single Python Version**: In your `.travis.yml`, set the Python version to just one (e.g., the latest version available on Travis-CI). Tox will handle the rest.\n\n2. **Install Required Python Versions**: Use `pyenv` to install the Python versions you need for your tests directly in your Travis-CI build. This allows you to bypass the limitation of missing Python interpreters.\n\n3. **Configure Tox**: Ensure your `tox.ini` is properly configured to include all the desired Python versions.\n\n4. **Run Tox in Travis-CI**: Use Tox to manage and run tests across the different environments.\n\nHere\u2019s an example configuration:\n\n```yaml\nlanguage: python\n# Use the latest version of Python available on Travis\npython:\n  - \"3.8\"\n\n# Install pyenv to manage multiple Python versions\nbefore_install:\n  - pyenv install 3.5.9\n  - pyenv install 3.6.10\n  - pyenv install 3.7.7\n  - pyenv global 3.5.9 3.6.10 3.7.7 3.8\n\n# Install tox\ninstall:\n  - pip install tox\n\n# Run tox to handle the testing in different environments\nscript:\n  - tox\n\n# Cache pip dependencies to speed up builds\ncache:\n  pip: true\n```\n\n### `tox.ini` Example\n\nEnsure your `tox.ini` is correctly set up. Here\u2019s a basic example:\n\n```ini\n[tox]\nenvlist = py35, py36, py37, py38\n\n[testenv]\ndeps =\n    pytest\ncommands =\n    pytest\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Single Python Version in `.travis.yml`**: This prevents redundant installations and tests by letting Tox handle the Python environments.\n- **Using `pyenv`**: This workaround addresses the interpreter availability issue by explicitly installing the Python versions you need.\n- **Avoid Redundancy**: By specifying Tox environments in `tox.ini`, you ensure tests are only run once per environment.\n\nThis approach should streamline your CI process, leveraging Tox to manage Python environments and thus reducing build times significantly."
