        "content": "The error you're encountering indicates that the OpenCV library, specifically the `aruco` module, is not installed in your Anaconda environment. To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that OpenCV is installed with the `opencv-contrib-python` package, which includes the `aruco` module.\n\nHere's how you can install it:\n\n1. **Activate your Anaconda environment**:\n   First, activate the Anaconda environment where you want to install OpenCV. Replace `your_env_name` with the name of your environment.\n   ```bash\n   conda activate your_env_name\n   ```\n\n2. **Install OpenCV with the `opencv-contrib-python` package**:\n   The `opencv-contrib-python` package contains extra modules, including `aruco`, that are not part of the main OpenCV package. You can install it using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install opencv-contrib-python\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify the installation**:\n   After installation, you can verify that the module is correctly installed by executing the following lines in a Python shell:\n   ```python\n   import cv2\n   print(cv2.__version__)\n   ```\n\n   Then check if you can import `aruco`:\n   ```python\n   import cv2.aruco\n   ```\n\nIf everything is set up correctly, you should not see any import errors. If you encounter any issues, make sure that your environment paths are correctly configured and that there are no conflicting versions of OpenCV installed."
