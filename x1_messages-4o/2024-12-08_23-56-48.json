        "content": "To analyze the given sequence of numbers and forecast the succeeding number, we can use a step-by-step approach involving mathematical concepts such as differences, sequences, and pattern recognition. Let's go through the process:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Differences\nFirst, calculate the differences between consecutive terms in the sequence to identify any patterns.\n\n|  n  |   x   | Difference |\n|:---:|:-----:|:----------:|\n|  1  |   2   |     -      |\n|  2  |   3   |     1      |\n|  3  |  10   |     7      |\n|  4  |  15   |     5      |\n|  5  |  26   |    11      |\n|  6  |  35   |     9      |\n|  7  |  50   |    15      |\n|  8  |  63   |    13      |\n|  9  |  82   |    19      |\n| 10  |  99   |    17      |\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Differences\nCheck if the differences themselves form a pattern. In this case, they alternate between odd numbers increasing by 2.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Pattern\nThe differences are: 1, 7, 5, 11, 9, 15, 13, 19, 17. Notice that every two differences, the second difference increases by 6. This suggests a secondary pattern or sequence within the differences.\n\n### Step 4: Predict the Next Difference\nFollowing the pattern, the next difference should be 23 (since the last difference was 17, the next should be 17 + 6).\n\n### Step 5: Forecast the Next Number\nAdd the predicted next difference to the last number in the sequence to forecast the succeeding number. \n\n- Last number: 99\n- Next difference: 23\n- Next number: 99 + 23 = 122\n\n### Step 6: Use Excel Formula for Verification\nThe provided Excel formula calculates an average trend prediction, which is another way to estimate the next number in the sequence:\n\n```excel\n=ROUND(AVERAGE($B$1:$B$10)+($B$10-$B$1)/9, 0)\n```\n\n- AVERAGE($B$1:$B$10) calculates the average of the sequence.\n- ($B$10-$B$1)/9 calculates the average difference between consecutive terms based on the first and last term.\n\nUsing this formula, you might get a different approximation due to the specific calculation method, but it's another valid approach to finding a trend-based prediction.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe sequence seems to follow a pattern of differences increasing by a secondary sequence of odd numbers. Using this pattern, we predict the next number to be 122. The Excel formula provides an alternative trend-based estimation."
