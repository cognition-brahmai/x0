I have tried using the command `python manage.py dumpdata django.contrib.auth > 'django.contrib.admin.json'` and `python manage.py dumpdata 'django.contrib.auth' > 'django.contrib.admin.json'`, but both attempts return the error `Error: Unknown application: django.contrib.auth`. Can you provide guidance on how to resolve this issue?"

        "content": "To dump data from the `django.contrib.auth` app using Django's `dumpdata` command, you need to specify the correct format for the application label. The `dumpdata` command expects the app label without the `django.contrib.` prefix. Instead, you should use `auth` as the app label. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```bash\npython manage.py dumpdata auth > django_contrib_auth.json\n```\n\nThis command will output the data related to the `auth` app into a file named `django_contrib_auth.json`.\n\nIf you want to dump data for specific models within the `auth` app, you can specify the models like so:\n\n```bash\npython manage.py dumpdata auth.User > auth_user.json\npython manage.py dumpdata auth.Group > auth_group.json\n```\n\nThese commands will dump the data for the `User` and `Group` models, respectively.\n\nMake sure you run these commands within the environment where your Django application is set up and the virtual environment (if any) is activated. This ensures that the Django settings are correctly loaded and accessible."
