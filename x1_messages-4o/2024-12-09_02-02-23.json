I have run this print() statement with parentheses on various Python 2.x interpreters and it seemed to work perfectly without even needing to import any module. Could you explain?"

        "content": "In Python 2.x, `print` is primarily a statement, not a function. This means that typically, you would use `print` without parentheses, like so: `print \"Hello SO!\"`. However, using parentheses as in `print(\"Hello SO!\")` does work in Python 2.x, but it is interpreted differently.\n\nWhen you write `print(\"Hello SO!\")` in Python 2.x, it is actually treated as a print statement with a single tuple consisting of the string `\"Hello SO!\"`. Since a single-item tuple with a string element doesn't affect the output, it appears to function the same way as `print \"Hello SO!\"`.\n\nHowever, if you were to include more items inside the parentheses, like `print(\"Hello\", \"SO!\")`, it would print the tuple `('Hello', 'SO!')`, which is different from just printing the strings separated by a space.\n\nPython 2.6 introduced the feature `from __future__ import print_function`, which allows you to use the print function as it is in Python 3.x. If you include this import statement at the top of your script, `print(\"Hello SO!\")` would be treated as a function call, allowing for more consistent behavior with Python 3.x.\n\nIn summary, while `print(\"Hello SO!\")` works in Python 2.x, it is technically being interpreted as printing a tuple, and not as a print function call unless the future import is used."
