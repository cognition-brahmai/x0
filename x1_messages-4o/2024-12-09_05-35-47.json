I want to be able to visit a webpage and have it run a specific Python function, with the progress then displayed on the webpage itself. I am trying to implement this using Markus Unterwaditzer's code. \n\nHere's the code I have so far:\n\n```python\nimport flask\nimport subprocess\n\napp = flask.Flask(__name__)\n\ndef test():\n    print \"Test\"\n\n@app.route('/yield')\ndef index():\n    def inner():\n        proc = subprocess.Popen(\n            test(),\n            shell=True,\n            stdout=subprocess.PIPE\n        )\n\n        while proc.poll() is None:\n            yield proc.stdout.readline() + '&lt;br/&gt;\\n'\n    return flask.Response(inner(), mimetype='text/html')  \n\napp.run(debug=True, port=5005)\n```\n\nHowever, when I run this, I don't see anything in the browser. How can I fix this issue?"

        "content": "To achieve continuous output from a Python function on a webpage using Flask, you need to ensure that the function you want to run is executed properly and that its output is sent to the webpage in real-time. Your current implementation uses the `subprocess` module in a way that doesn't quite fit your goal. Let's modify your code to fix the issues:\n\n1. The `test` function should generate output that can be streamed. \n2. Avoid using `subprocess` for the `test` function if it's just a simple Python function.\n3. Use Flask's `Response` object to stream the output to the client.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, Response\nimport time\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\ndef test():\n    # Simulate some output generation\n    for i in range(10):\n        print(f\"Test iteration {i}\")\n        time.sleep(1)  # Simulate a delay\n        yield f\"Test iteration {i}<br/>\\n\"\n\n@app.route('/yield')\ndef index():\n    def generate():\n        # Call the test function and yield its output\n        for output in test():\n            yield output\n\n    return Response(generate(), mimetype='text/html')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True, port=5005)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Function Yielding Output:** The `test` function now uses a `yield` statement to generate output incrementally. This allows Flask to stream the output to the client.\n\n- **Streaming Response:** The `generate` function wraps the `test` function and is used to yield each line of output. This function is passed to `Response` to stream the output to the client.\n\n- **Simulated Delay:** I included a `time.sleep(1)` to simulate a delay between outputs, which is often the case in real-world scenarios where tasks take time to complete.\n\n- **Direct Output:** We directly print the output in the `test` function and yield it, which is more appropriate than using `subprocess` for a simple Python function.\n\n- **HTML Line Breaks:** The output includes HTML line breaks (`<br/>`) to format the text on the webpage properly.\n\nWith these changes, when you visit `http://localhost:5005/yield`, you should see the output being updated in real-time on the webpage."
