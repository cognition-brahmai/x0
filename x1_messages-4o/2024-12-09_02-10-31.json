When I try to assign a default value to a dataclass field that uses __slots__, I get a ValueError: 'x' in __slots__ conflicts with class variable. Here's my current code:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\n@dataclass\nclass C():\n    __slots__ = \"x\"\n    x: int = 1\n```\nThis results in an error:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nValueError: 'x' in __slots__ conflicts with class variable\n```\n\nHow can I resolve this?"

        "content": "To resolve the conflict between `__slots__` and default dataclass fields, you need to use the `field` function from the `dataclasses` module to specify a default value. This approach avoids the conflict by ensuring the default value is assigned at the instance level rather than at the class level, which is what causes the conflict with `__slots__`.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to work correctly:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\n\n@dataclass\nclass C:\n    __slots__ = \"x\"\n    x: int = field(default=1)\n```\n\nIn this code, the `field(default=1)` function is used to set the default value for `x`. This avoids the creation of a class variable, which is what causes the conflict with `__slots__`. Now, the dataclass will correctly use `__slots__` to manage instance attributes, and `x` will have a default value of `1` when an instance of `C` is created without explicitly setting `x`."
