        "content": "The error you're encountering, `AttributeError: 'Sequential' object has no attribute 'output_names'`, typically arises due to version mismatches or changes in the TensorFlow library. TensorFlow often updates its API, and some attributes or methods may be deprecated or replaced in newer versions.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to help you resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check TensorFlow Version**:\n   Ensure you are using a compatible TensorFlow version. The `output_names` attribute is not part of recent TensorFlow versions for the `Sequential` model. You can check your TensorFlow version with:\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n   print(tf.__version__)\n   ```\n\n2. **Update Your Code**:\n   If you're using a newer version of TensorFlow, you might not need to specify `output_names` manually. Try updating your code by removing any manual references to `output_names`.\n\n3. **Update TensorFlow**:\n   If you are using an older version of TensorFlow, consider updating TensorFlow to the latest stable version:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade tensorflow\n   ```\n\n4. **Custom Objects**:\n   If your model uses custom layers or objects, you need to pass them in the `custom_objects` parameter when loading the model. Define all custom layers and objects and include them like this:\n   ```python\n   from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model\n\n   # Example: If you have a custom activation or layer\n   def custom_activation(x):\n       return x\n\n   new_model = load_model('124446.model', custom_objects={'custom_activation': custom_activation})\n   ```\n\n5. **Model File Corruption**:\n   Ensure that the model file `124446.model` is not corrupted. If possible, try saving the model again and then attempt to load it.\n\n6. **Check Model Format**:\n   Ensure that the model was saved correctly. If it was saved using the `tf.keras` API, it should be compatible with the `load_model` method from `tf.keras.models`.\n\n7. **Alternative Loading Method**:\n   If the problem persists, try using the TensorFlow SavedModel format:\n   ```python\n   new_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('path_to_saved_model')\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue. If the problem persists, please provide more details about the TensorFlow version and any custom layers or objects used in your model."
