I have installed two versions of GNURadio and I want to write, run, and debug python scripts for the new version of GNURadio in Visual Studio Code. I've tried several methods, including setting the PYTHONPATH to a folder level higher, using $PYTHONPATH instead of PYTHONPATH, restarting VSCode after each change of the .env file, and using double quotes around the path string, but none of these methods have worked. What could I be doing wrong here?"

        "content": "Setting up the `$PYTHONPATH` correctly in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for your workspace can be a bit tricky, especially when dealing with multiple versions of libraries like GNURadio. Here are some steps and tips to ensure that you set it up correctly:\n\n1. **Verify Python Interpreter**:\n   - First, ensure that VSCode is using the correct Python interpreter for the version of GNURadio you want to work with. You can select the interpreter by:\n     - Opening the Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P` or `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS).\n     - Typing \"Python: Select Interpreter\" and choosing the appropriate Python environment.\n\n2. **Workspace Configuration**:\n   - Make sure you are working within the right workspace. You can either open a folder as a workspace or use a `.code-workspace` file.\n\n3. **Setting Up the `.env` File**:\n   - In your workspace folder, create a `.env` file if it doesn't already exist.\n   - Add the `PYTHONPATH` variable in the `.env` file. For example:\n     ```plaintext\n     PYTHONPATH=/path/to/your/gnuradio/new_version\n     ```\n   - Ensure the path you specify is the one where the desired version of GNURadio is installed.\n\n4. **Editing `settings.json`**:\n   - Sometimes, you may need to specify the environment file in the `settings.json` for your workspace:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"python.envFile\": \"${workspaceFolder}/.env\"\n     }\n     ```\n   - Ensure that `settings.json` is located in the `.vscode` folder of your workspace.\n\n5. **Verify the Path**:\n   - Double-check that the path you are setting in the `.env` file is correct and accessible. You can do this by navigating to the directory in your terminal or file explorer.\n\n6. **Reload VSCode**:\n   - After making changes, reload VSCode to ensure the new settings are applied. You can do this by using the `Reload Window` command from the Command Palette.\n\n7. **Check Output**:\n   - Look at the output in the VSCode terminal or the Python output panel to verify that the `PYTHONPATH` is being set. You can do this by running a small script that prints the `sys.path`:\n     ```python\n     import sys\n     print(sys.path)\n     ```\n   - This will help you confirm that your desired GNURadio path is included.\n\n8. **Debugging Configuration**:\n   - If you're running or debugging your scripts in VSCode, ensure your `launch.json` (also in the `.vscode` folder) is configured correctly to use the `.env` settings:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n       \"configurations\": [\n         {\n           \"name\": \"Python: Current File\",\n           \"type\": \"python\",\n           \"request\": \"launch\",\n           \"program\": \"${file}\",\n           \"console\": \"integratedTerminal\",\n           \"envFile\": \"${workspaceFolder}/.env\"\n         }\n       ]\n     }\n     ```\n\nIf you've followed these steps and it still doesn't work, it might be useful to check for typos in your `.env` file or `settings.json`, or verify that other environment variables or settings aren't conflicting with your desired configuration."
