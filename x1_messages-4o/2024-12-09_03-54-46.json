The resulting row should look like [prev, 1]. However, when I try to use the concatenate function with axis = 1, it doesn't work, because it seems to require all input arrays to have the same dimension. Can someone guide me on how to accomplish this? Most of the answers I found were a few years old and may not apply to the current version of numpy."

        "content": "Certainly! To expand your 2D numpy array by adding a column of 1s to the right, you can use `numpy`'s `concatenate` function or `numpy`'s `hstack` function. Here's how you can do it with both methods:\n\n### Using `numpy.concatenate`:\n\nThe issue you're facing might be due to not reshaping the array of ones correctly. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Assuming `original_array` is your 60000 by 200 array\noriginal_array = np.random.rand(60000, 200)  # Example array\n\n# Create a column of ones with shape (60000, 1)\nones_column = np.ones((60000, 1))\n\n# Concatenate the original array with the ones column along axis 1\nexpanded_array = np.concatenate((original_array, ones_column), axis=1)\n\nprint(expanded_array.shape)  # Should print (60000, 201)\n```\n\n### Using `numpy.hstack`:\n\n`hstack` is another convenient method to achieve the same result:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Assuming `original_array` is your 60000 by 200 array\noriginal_array = np.random.rand(60000, 200)  # Example array\n\n# Create a column of ones with shape (60000, 1)\nones_column = np.ones((60000, 1))\n\n# Stack the arrays horizontally\nexpanded_array = np.hstack((original_array, ones_column))\n\nprint(expanded_array.shape)  # Should print (60000, 201)\n```\n\nBoth methods should work for any version of `numpy` as they are standard ways to manipulate arrays. Ensure that the shapes of the arrays you are concatenating are compatible along the specified axis. In this case, the second dimension should match the number of rows (60000) for both arrays."
