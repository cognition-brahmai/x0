        "content": "To create a new melodic line that fits the lyrics \"The sun is shining bright\" and \"I'll be waiting here for you\", you'll need to consider the syllable count and rhythm of each phrase, as well as the harmonic context. Here\u2019s a modified version of the Ruby code using `midi-sound` that provides a new melody:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'midi-sound'\ninclude MidiSound\n\n# Define a method to play a sequence of notes with given durations\ndef play_melody(notes, durations)\n  notes.zip(durations).each do |note, duration|\n    play note, duration\n  end\nend\n\n# Define the melody for \"The sun is shining bright\"\nmelody1_notes = ['C5', 'E5', 'G5', 'F5', 'E5', 'D5', 'C5']\nmelody1_durations = [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0]\n\n# Define the melody for \"I'll be waiting here for you\"\nmelody2_notes = ['G5', 'A5', 'B5', 'A5', 'G5', 'F5', 'E5']\nmelody2_durations = [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0]\n\n# Combine the melodies\ncombined_notes = melody1_notes + melody2_notes\ncombined_durations = melody1_durations + melody2_durations\n\n# Play the combined melody\nplay_melody(combined_notes, combined_durations)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Rhythmic Structure**: Both phrases have a similar rhythmic pattern with a total of seven syllables each, allowing us to use a similar rhythmic structure.\n\n2. **Melodic Contour**: The melody for \"The sun is shining bright\" is designed to rise and then gently fall, while \"I'll be waiting here for you\" starts high and descends. This creates a natural flow between the two phrases.\n\n3. **Harmonic Context**: The notes are chosen in a way that fits a common key, C major, which is simple and harmonically consonant with both phrases.\n\n4. **Method Abstraction**: The `play_melody` method allows you to easily modify note sequences and durations for further experimentation and variation.\n\nYou can further experiment with different notes and rhythms to find a melody that best suits the emotional tone of your lyrics."
