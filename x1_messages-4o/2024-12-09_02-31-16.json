I want to exclude these particular dependencies because they are already met from a different install path, like an Anaconda install. I don't have the privilege to add packages to the default Python installation and I don't want to. Currently, I'm using the -r and -t options of pip but haven't found a way to exclude specific packages. Ideally, I'd use a pip command like `pip install --log pip.log -r req.txt -t /mypath/pypkgs/ --exclude exclude.txt`. I can't use `--no-deps` because I need some of the dependencies. At the moment, I'm considering a Python script to do pip installs that include dependencies I don't need via `pip install --log pip.log -r req.txt -t /mypath/python/pkgs/` and then automatically remove the unneeded dependencies after the pip install finishes. Is there a combination of pip commands that can achieve what I'm looking for in a more straightforward way? I'm using pip 7.1.2."

        "content": "To achieve your objective of installing Python packages to a custom directory while excluding specific dependencies, you can take a more automated approach with a Python script. Although pip does not natively support excluding specific dependencies directly during installation, you can manage this with a workaround. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Prepare your requirements file**: Create a `requirements.txt` file with the packages you want to install.\n\n2. **List exclusions**: Create an `exclude.txt` file containing the dependencies you want to exclude.\n\n3. **Python Script to Manage Installation**:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\n\ndef install_packages(requirements_file, target_dir, exclude_file):\n    # Read the list of packages to exclude\n    with open(exclude_file) as f:\n        excluded_packages = set(line.strip() for line in f if line.strip())\n\n    # Install the main packages with dependencies\n    subprocess.check_call([\n        sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install',\n        '-r', requirements_file, '-t', target_dir\n    ])\n    \n    # Get the list of installed packages\n    installed_packages = subprocess.check_output([\n        sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'freeze', '--path', target_dir\n    ]).decode().splitlines()\n    \n    # Uninstall the excluded packages\n    for package in installed_packages:\n        package_name = package.split('==')[0]\n        if package_name in excluded_packages:\n            subprocess.check_call([\n                sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'uninstall', '-y', package_name, '--path', target_dir\n            ])\n\n# Usage\ninstall_packages('req.txt', '/mypath/python/pkgs/', 'exclude.txt')\n```\n\n4. **Run the Script**: Execute the script in your Python environment. It installs all packages listed in `req.txt` to `/mypath/python/pkgs/` and then uninstalls any packages listed in `exclude.txt`.\n\n### Notes:\n\n- **Ensure Compatibility**: Check that all paths and filenames are correct and accessible.\n- **Python Environment**: Make sure the script is run in the environment where you intend to manage your packages.\n- **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to read and write to the target directory.\n- **Dependencies**: Be aware that removing dependencies may affect the functionality of the installed packages. Test thoroughly to ensure everything works as expected.\n\nThis approach gives you the flexibility to manage your installations while accommodating the existing setup constraints you have with Anaconda or other installations."
