When I run my program, I encounter a Win32Exception stating \"The system cannot find the file specified.\" This error occurs at the first actual line of the program: \"CudafyModule km = CudafyTranslator.Cudafy();\". There's no indication from the exception object as to what file they're attempting to load. I also see the same exception when running the bundled examples from the Codeplex download in VS2010 using .NET 4.0. The stack trace is as follows:\n\n```C#\nat System.Diagnostics.Process.StartWithCreateProcess(ProcessStartInfo startInfo)\nat Cudafy.CudafyModule.Compile(eGPUCompiler mode, Boolean deleteGeneratedCode)\nat Cudafy.Translator.CudafyTranslator.Cudafy(ePlatform platform, eArchitecture arch, Version cudaVersion, Boolean compile, Type[] types)\nat Cudafy.Translator.CudafyTranslator.Cudafy(ePlatform platform, eArchitecture arch, Type[] types)\nat Cudafy.Translator.CudafyTranslator.Cudafy()\n```\nHow can I solve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering with CUDAfy.NET often arises when there is an issue with the CUDA compiler (nvcc) not being found or incorrectly configured. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this problem:\n\n1. **Verify CUDA Installation**:\n   - Ensure that CUDA is properly installed on your system. Double-check that the installation includes the CUDA toolkit, which contains `nvcc`.\n   - Verify the version of CUDA installed matches the version expected by the CUDAfy.NET library you are using.\n\n2. **Check Environment Variables**:\n   - Ensure that the `PATH` environment variable includes the paths to the CUDA toolkit and the bin directory where `nvcc.exe` resides. Typically, this would look something like `C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\vXX.X\\bin`.\n   - You may also need to add the `CUDA_PATH` environment variable pointing to the CUDA installation directory.\n\n3. **Platform and Architecture Settings**:\n   - When calling `CudafyTranslator.Cudafy()`, ensure that the platform and architecture parameters match your installed CUDA version and your target device. For example, try specifying:\n     ```csharp\n     CudafyModule km = CudafyTranslator.Cudafy(ePlatform.x64, eArchitecture.sm_XX);\n     ```\n     Replace `sm_XX` with the compute capability of your GPU. You can find this information on NVIDIA's website or from your GPU specifications.\n\n4. **Permissions**:\n   - Ensure that the application has sufficient permissions to execute processes. You may need to run Visual Studio as an administrator.\n\n5. **Check for Missing Files**:\n   - If any examples or additional files are required by CUDAfy.NET for compilation, make sure they are present in your project directory.\n\n6. **Reinstall CUDAfy.NET**:\n   - If none of the above steps work, try removing and then reinstalling CUDAfy.NET via NuGet to ensure that all necessary dependencies are correctly set up.\n\n7. **Consult Documentation and Community**:\n   - Refer to CUDAfy.NET documentation for any specific setup instructions or known issues.\n   - Check forums or community discussions for similar issues. Sometimes specific versions of CUDA or .NET might have known compatibility issues.\n\nBy ensuring that your environment is correctly set up and that all paths and versions match, you should be able to resolve the Win32Exception in your CUDAfy.NET project."
