I need to create a diagonal matrix B, such that B = diag(a1, a2, a3, ..., an) using the elements of this row vector. When I tried the following code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\na = np.matrix([1,2,3,4])\nd = np.diag(a)\nprint (d)\n```\n\nI received the output as [1], but my expected output is:\n\n```python\n[[1 0 0 0]\n [0 2 0 0]\n [0 0 3 0]\n [0 0 0 4]]\n```\n\nWhat is the correct way to achieve this in Python?"

        "content": "To convert a row vector into a diagonal matrix in Python using NumPy, you should ensure that the input to the `np.diag()` function is a one-dimensional array (not a matrix). The function `np.diag()` expects a one-dimensional array as input to create a diagonal matrix. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the row vector\na = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])\n\n# Create a diagonal matrix using np.diag\nd = np.diag(a)\n\n# Print the resulting diagonal matrix\nprint(d)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, you should get the expected output:\n\n```\n[[1 0 0 0]\n [0 2 0 0]\n [0 0 3 0]\n [0 0 0 4]]\n```\n\nThe key is to use `np.array` to create a one-dimensional array instead of `np.matrix`. This will ensure that `np.diag()` treats it as a sequence of elements to place on the diagonal of the resulting matrix."
