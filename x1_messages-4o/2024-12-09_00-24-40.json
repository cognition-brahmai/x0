The script starts with the standard hashbang `#! /usr/bin/env python` and I've linked it into the bin directory of my virtualenv `~/environments/project/env/bin/myscript`. I've also added the bin directory to my path. When I run the command `myscript`, I get an import error with one of the libraries. However, the script works as expected when I activate the virtual environment and run it. I've tried moving the script inside the bin folder and running the script directly with Python `python ~/environments/project/env/bin/myscript`, but none of these has solved the problem. Previously, I was using a script that activated the environment and then ran my script, but I was under the impression that a script run from this folder should run with the virtualenv's interpreter and site-packages. Why might this not be working and how could I debug this?"

        "content": "When you create a symbolic link to your script in the virtual environment's `bin` directory and add that directory to your `PATH`, it might not be using the virtual environment's interpreter and libraries as expected. Here are a few steps to help debug and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check the Shebang Line**: Ensure that your shebang line is using the virtual environment's Python interpreter. You can find the correct path by running `which python` while the virtual environment is activated. Replace the shebang line in your script with `#! /path/to/venv/bin/python`.\n\n2. **Verify PATH**: Make sure that the virtual environment's `bin` directory is at the beginning of your `PATH`. This ensures that the virtual environment's Python interpreter is used first. You can check your `PATH` by running `echo $PATH`.\n\n3. **Activate Script**: If you previously used a script to activate the virtual environment and then run your script, this is a reliable way to ensure the correct environment is used. You can call this activation script from another script or alias that you use to execute your main script.\n\n4. **Check for Hardcoded Paths**: Ensure there are no hardcoded paths in your script that might be pointing to the global Python libraries instead of the virtual environment.\n\n5. **Environment Isolation**: Make sure no global environment variables are interfering with your script's execution. You can use `env` to inspect your environment variables.\n\n6. **Debug ImportError**: When you encounter the ImportError, try running the following command to get more details:\n   ```bash\n   python -m site\n   ```\n   This will display which site-packages directories are being used, and you can verify if the virtual environment's site-packages are included.\n\n7. **Create a Wrapper Script**: If the above steps do not resolve the issue, consider creating a wrapper shell script that activates the virtual environment and then runs your Python script. Here's a simple example:\n   ```bash\n   #!/bin/bash\n   source /path/to/venv/bin/activate\n   python /path/to/venv/bin/myscript\n   ```\n\n8. **Python Version Consistency**: Ensure that the Python version used in the virtual environment matches the version used globally if you're relying on any specific version features or libraries.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and fix the issue that's causing your script to not run as expected globally."
