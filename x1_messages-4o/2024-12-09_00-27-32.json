I've tried the following code, but it still opens up a visible version of Firefox:\n\n```python\nbinary = FirefoxBinary('C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Mozilla Firefox\\\\firefox.exe', log_file=sys.stdout)\nbinary.add_command_line_options('-headless')\nself.driver = webdriver.Firefox(firefox_binary=binary)\n```\n\nI've also attempted using different variations of the binary path:\n\n```python\nbinary = FirefoxBinary('C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Nightly\\\\firefox.exe', log_file=sys.stdout)\nbinary.add_command_line_options(\"--headless\")\n```\n\nDespite these attempts, I'm still unable to achieve a headless run."

        "content": "To run Firefox in headless mode using Selenium with Python, you should use the `Options` class provided by Selenium's Firefox driver to set the `headless` option. The `FirefoxBinary` approach is not necessary for running Firefox headlessly. Here's how you can set it up:\n\n1. Make sure you have the latest version of the Selenium package and the correct version of the GeckoDriver installed that is compatible with your version of Firefox.\n\n2. Use the `Options` class to set Firefox to run in headless mode. Here's a complete example:\n\n```python\nfrom selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options\n\n# Set up Firefox options\noptions = Options()\noptions.add_argument(\"--headless\")  # Enable headless mode\n\n# Specify the path to the Firefox binary if it's not in your PATH\n# options.binary_location = 'C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Mozilla Firefox\\\\firefox.exe'\n\n# Initialize the WebDriver with the headless option\ndriver = webdriver.Firefox(options=options)\n\n# Your Selenium code here\ndriver.get(\"https://www.example.com\")\nprint(driver.title)\n\n# Clean up\ndriver.quit()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Options Class**: Use `Options()` to configure headless mode by adding `--headless` as an argument.\n\n- **Binary Location**: You only need to specify the binary location if Firefox is not installed in a standard location or not in your system's PATH.\n\n- **GeckoDriver**: Ensure that the `geckodriver` executable is in your PATH or specify its location using the `executable_path` parameter when initializing the `webdriver.Firefox`.\n\nIf you're still facing issues, make sure:\n\n- You're using a compatible version of Selenium, GeckoDriver, and Firefox.\n- Your environment variables are set correctly if you have custom paths for Firefox or GeckoDriver.\n- You have the necessary permissions to execute binaries if you're running this on a server or Docker."
