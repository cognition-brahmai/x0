It emphasizes the subject and the action they are performing.\n\n**Passive Voice:**\n- **Structure:** Object + Form of \"to be\" + Past Participle + (by Subject)\n- **Example:** \"The room was decorated by her.\"\n- **Usage:** The action is performed upon the subject. The doer of the action may be omitted or included after the verb.\n- **Impact:** It can make sentences less direct, often focusing more on the action or the object rather than who is performing the action. It can be useful for emphasizing the action or when the doer is unknown or irrelevant.\n\n### Differences Between Active and Passive Voice\n\n| Aspect         | Active Voice                             | Passive Voice                            |\n|----------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Structure      | Subject + Verb + Object                  | Object + Form of \"to be\" + Past Participle (+ by Subject) |\n| Focus          | Subject and Action                       | Action or Object                         |\n| Clarity        | More direct and clearer                  | Less direct, can be less clear           |\n| Emphasis       | On the performer of the action           | On the action or the receiver of the action |\n| Usage          | When the doer is important               | When the action or receiver is more important, or the doer is unknown/irrelevant |\n\n### Examples\n\n**Active Voice Sentences:**\n1. **\"The chef cooked a delicious meal.\"**\n   - Focuses on the chef and emphasizes their action of cooking.\n   \n2. **\"The scientist discovered a new element.\"**\n   - Highlights the scientist and their important discovery.\n   \n3. **\"The dog chased the cat.\"**\n   - Emphasizes the dog\u2019s action, creating a dynamic and vivid image.\n\n**Passive Voice Sentences:**\n1. **\"A delicious meal was cooked by the chef.\"**\n   - Shifts focus to the meal itself, useful if the meal is the topic of discussion.\n   \n2. **\"A new element was discovered by the scientist.\"**\n   - Emphasizes the discovery itself, potentially useful in scientific papers where the process or result is more important than the discoverer.\n   \n3. **\"The cat was chased by the dog.\"**\n   - Places emphasis on the cat, perhaps to highlight its plight or experience.\n\n### Visual Aid\n\n#### Diagram: Active vs. Passive Voice Structure\n\n```\nActive Voice:\n[ Subject ] \u2192 [ Verb ] \u2192 [ Object ]\n  \\            \\             \\\n   \\            \\             \\\n    \\            \\             \\\n     \\            \\             \\\n      \\___________ \\ ____________\\\n                   \\ \nPassive Voice:\n[ Object ] \u2190 [ Form of \"to be\" + Past Participle ] \u2190 [ (by Subject) ]\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUnderstanding the choice between active and passive voice is crucial for effective communication. Active voice brings clarity and directness, making it ideal for most day-to-day communication. Passive voice, on the other hand, serves well in formal, scientific, or situations where the action or result is more relevant than the actor. By mastering both, one can tailor their language to suit the context, purpose, and audience effectively."
