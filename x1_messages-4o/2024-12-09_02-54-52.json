This code was working fine a few months ago and nothing in the code base has changed, only the data being passed to it.\n\nHere's the code I used:\n\n```python\nf = 1437506779950.0\ndatetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(float(f))\n```\n\nAnd here's the error I got:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nValueError: year is out of range\n```\n\nWhat could have caused this to break?"

        "content": "The error you are encountering, `ValueError: year is out of range`, is likely due to the timestamp you're trying to convert being in milliseconds rather than seconds. In Python's `datetime` module, the `fromtimestamp()` method expects a timestamp in seconds since the epoch (January 1, 1970). If your timestamp is in milliseconds, it will be interpreted as a very large number of seconds, leading to an out-of-range year.\n\nHere's how you can fix it:\n\n1. **Convert milliseconds to seconds**: Divide the timestamp by 1000 to convert it from milliseconds to seconds.\n\nHere's the modified code:\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\nf = 1437506779950.0\n# Convert milliseconds to seconds\ntimestamp_in_seconds = f / 1000.0\n# Convert to datetime\ndt = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp_in_seconds)\nprint(dt)\n```\n\nBy dividing the timestamp by 1000, you should be able to successfully convert it into a valid `datetime` object without encountering the \"year is out of range\" error."
