        "content": "Yes, it is possible to pass functions with arguments to another function in Python. You can achieve this by using Python's *args and **kwargs to handle variable numbers of positional and keyword arguments. Here's how you can modify your `perform` function to accomplish this:\n\n```python\ndef perform(function, *args, **kwargs):\n    return function(*args, **kwargs)\n```\n\nWith this setup, you can pass functions with different numbers of arguments to `perform` like so:\n\n```python\ndef action1():\n    print(\"Action1 executed\")\n\ndef action2(p):\n    print(f\"Action2 executed with argument: {p}\")\n\ndef action3(p, r):\n    print(f\"Action3 executed with arguments: {p}, {r}\")\n\n# Using the perform function\nperform(action1)          # Calls action1()\nperform(action2, \"param\") # Calls action2(\"param\")\nperform(action3, \"param1\", \"param2\") # Calls action3(\"param1\", \"param2\")\n```\n\nHere, `*args` collects any additional positional arguments into a tuple, and `**kwargs` collects any keyword arguments into a dictionary, allowing you to pass them to the function you're calling dynamically."
