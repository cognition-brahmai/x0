Are there any other machine learning libraries available for Android that could fulfill my requirements?"

        "content": "For building a text mining tool on Android with features like clustering and classification, there are several libraries you can consider:\n\n1. **ML Kit by Google**: While primarily focused on on-device machine learning, ML Kit provides some features for text recognition and natural language processing. It's integrated into Firebase, which can be convenient if you're already using Firebase services.\n\n2. **Weka for Android**: Weka is a well-known machine learning library in the Java ecosystem. There's an Android port available, which could provide the functionalities you need, such as clustering and classification. You might need to handle some performance optimizations yourself, given the resource constraints on mobile devices.\n\n3. **DL4J (Deeplearning4j)**: While primarily a deep learning library, DL4J can be used for a range of machine learning tasks, and it is compatible with Android. It might offer more complex functionalities than you need, but it's worth exploring if you're interested in deep learning as well.\n\n4. **Apache Mahout**: Originally designed for large-scale data processing, Mahout has evolved to provide a range of machine-learning algorithms. While not natively designed for Android, you can potentially integrate parts of it into your application, especially if you're handling data processing on a server and only need to display results on Android.\n\n5. **Smile**: Another Java-based library that offers a wide range of machine learning algorithms. Smile can be a good choice for a more traditional approach to machine learning tasks.\n\n6. **TFLite Model Maker**: While you mentioned TensorFlow and its limitations, TensorFlow Lite\u2019s Model Maker might be worth a try. It simplifies the process of training and deploying models on mobile devices. It supports text classification and other NLP functions.\n\n7. **Scikit-learn and ONNX**: Although Scikit-learn is a Python library, you can train models using Scikit-learn, export them using the ONNX format, and then run them on Android using the ONNX Runtime.\n\nBefore choosing a library, consider the specific requirements of your application, such as performance constraints, ease of integration, and the size of the models you plan to deploy."
