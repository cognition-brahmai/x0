        "content": "The errors you're encountering suggest that your script is being executed in a shell environment rather than as a Python script. This typically happens when you try to run the script with a shell command instead of using Python to execute it. Here\u2019s how you can fix it:\n\n1. **Ensure you're running the script with Python**: Make sure you are executing the script with the Python interpreter. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   python xx.py\n   ```\n\n   If `python` doesn't refer to Python 2.7.5, you might need to specify the correct version explicitly:\n\n   ```bash\n   python2.7 xx.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Check the shebang line**: If you want to make the script executable directly, add a shebang line at the top of your script to specify the Python interpreter. Add the following line at the very top of your `xx.py` file:\n\n   ```python\n   #!/usr/bin/env python2.7\n   ```\n\n   Then, make your script executable:\n\n   ```bash\n   chmod +x xx.py\n   ```\n\n   After this, you can run it directly with `./xx.py`.\n\n3. **Ensure you have defined `username` and `password`**: Your script uses variables `username` and `password`, but these must be defined somewhere in your script. You should replace them with the actual values or set them before using them:\n\n   ```python\n   username = \"your_username\"\n   password = \"your_password\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for correct indentation**: Ensure that there are no indentation issues in your script, as Python is indentation-sensitive.\n\nAfter making these changes, try running your script again. If you encounter further issues, feel free to ask for more help!"
