However, when using 'object', the module runs without any issues. Is 'object' a keyword in Python?"

        "content": "In Python, `object` is indeed a special built-in class and serves as the most base type for all classes. When you define a class using `class Classname(object)`, you are explicitly specifying that your class `Classname` is a new-style class that inherits from `object`. This is the default behavior in Python 3, where all classes are new-style classes by default, even if you don't explicitly inherit from `object`.\n\nIn Python 2, however, there is a distinction between old-style and new-style classes, and you need to explicitly inherit from `object` to create a new-style class, which provides several advantages, such as a unified type system, descriptors, and more advanced method resolution order (MRO).\n\nWhen you tried to use `randomobject` (or any other undefined name), Python raised an error because it couldn't find a definition for `randomobject`. In order to use a class as a base class, Python needs to know what that class is, so it must be defined or imported before you can use it in a class definition.\n\nSo, in summary, `object` is not a keyword, but it is a very special built-in class that acts as the ancestor of all classes in Python."
