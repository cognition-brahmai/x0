        "content": "In Django 1.3, the `collectstatic` command is used to gather all static files from your apps and any additional locations specified in `STATICFILES_DIRS` into the directory specified by `STATIC_ROOT`. However, it's important to note that `STATIC_ROOT` is meant to be a single directory where all static files are collected for deployment, and it should not overlap with any of the directories listed in `STATICFILES_DIRS`.\n\nIf you try to set `STATICFILES_DIRS` to include `STATIC_ROOT`, you might run into issues where files are copied on top of each other, or you could create a loop where the command keeps copying files back and forth.\n\nThe recommended approach is to ensure that `STATICFILES_DIRS` includes all the directories where your static files are located, excluding `STATIC_ROOT`. These directories can contain your global files as well. When you run `collectstatic`, it will gather all these files into `STATIC_ROOT`, which you can then use for serving static files in production.\n\nHere's an example configuration:\n\n```python\n# settings.py\n\n# Directory where collectstatic will gather all static files\nSTATIC_ROOT = '/path/to/static_root/'\n\n# List of directories where Django will search for additional static files\nSTATICFILES_DIRS = [\n    '/path/to/your/global/static/files/',\n    '/another/path/to/static/files/',\n    # Add more directories as needed\n]\n```\n\nAfter setting this up, you can run the `collectstatic` command to gather all static files into `STATIC_ROOT`:\n\n```bash\npython manage.py collectstatic\n```\n\nThis way, you can manage your additional global files efficiently without causing any configuration issues."
