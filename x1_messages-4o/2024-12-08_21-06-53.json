Assuming that your table has columns labeled \"Temperature\" and \"Humidity\", here's how you can set up the formulas:\n\n1. **Average Temperature on Hot and Humid Days:**\n\n   Let's assume:\n   - Column A contains the temperature readings.\n   - Column B contains the humidity readings.\n\n   The formula to calculate the average temperature for days that are both hot and humid would be:\n\n   ```excel\n   =AVERAGEIFS(A2:A8, A2:A8, \">80\", B2:B8, \">60\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Average Humidity on Hot and Humid Days:**\n\n   Similarly, to calculate the average humidity for days that are both hot and humid, use:\n\n   ```excel\n   =AVERAGEIFS(B2:B8, A2:A8, \">80\", B2:B8, \">60\")\n   ```\n\nIn these formulas:\n- `A2:A8` and `B2:B8` are the ranges that contain your temperature and humidity data, respectively.\n- `\">80\"` is the condition applied to the temperature range, and `\">60\"` is the condition applied to the humidity range.\n\nMake sure to adjust the cell ranges to match the actual data range in your Excel sheet."
