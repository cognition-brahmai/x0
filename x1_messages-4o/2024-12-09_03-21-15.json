        "content": "In Python IDLE, removing indentation from multiple lines can be a bit tricky since IDLE doesn't support the Shift+Tab shortcut for unindenting. However, you can achieve this by using the following method:\n\n1. **Select the Lines**: First, highlight the lines from which you want to remove the indentation.\n\n2. **Remove Indentation**: Press `Ctrl+]` (the right square bracket). This will increase the indentation. To decrease the indentation, use `Ctrl+[`. This combination will decrease the indentation level of the selected lines.\n\nBy using `Ctrl+[`, you can effectively unindent multiple lines at once. Remember that each press of `Ctrl+[ ` will remove one level of indentation, so you might need to press it multiple times if your code is heavily indented."
