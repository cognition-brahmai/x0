However, when the content type is explicitly stated as 'Content-Type:text/html; charset=utf-8', it returns properly encoded data. Interestingly, urllib.urlopen() seems to return properly encoded data in all cases. Has anyone noticed this behavior with requests.get() before and why does it behave like this?"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing with Python's `requests.get()` function stems from how the `requests` library handles character encoding based on the HTTP headers provided by the server. When you make a request using `requests.get()`, the library tries to determine the correct encoding by examining the `Content-Type` header of the HTTP response.\n\n1. **Content-Type Header**: If the server's response includes a `charset` parameter in the `Content-Type` header (e.g., `Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8`), `requests` uses that specified encoding to decode the response text. This is why you get properly encoded data when the charset is explicitly stated.\n\n2. **Missing Charset Information**: If the `charset` parameter is absent, as in `Content-Type: text/html`, `requests` defaults to guessing the encoding. By default, it uses `ISO-8859-1` (Latin-1) if no charset is specified, which can lead to improperly encoded text if the actual encoding is different.\n\n3. **Urllib Behavior**: On the other hand, `urllib` has a slightly different way of handling encodings. It tends to inspect the content more deeply and may rely on other cues, such as meta tags within the HTML, to infer the correct encoding. This behavior can sometimes lead to more accurate results when the charset is not explicitly defined in the HTTP headers.\n\n### Solution\n\nTo ensure that you always get the correct encoding with `requests`, you can manually specify the encoding after you receive the response, especially when the server doesn't provide a charset:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\nresponse = requests.get('http://example.com')\nresponse.encoding = 'utf-8'  # Manually set the encoding\ntext = response.text\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you want to automate the detection of the correct encoding more accurately, you can use libraries like `chardet` or `cchardet` to help determine the correct encoding:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport chardet\n\nresponse = requests.get('http://example.com')\nencoding = chardet.detect(response.content)['encoding']\nresponse.encoding = encoding\ntext = response.text\n```\n\nThis approach gives you more control and accuracy over the character encoding of the response content."
