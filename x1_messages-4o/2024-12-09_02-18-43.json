These variables must be specific types, either int or list. In C++, I would make them private and use type-checking in the 'set' function. Since this isn't possible in Python, is there a way to restrict the type of these variables such that an error/exception occurs at runtime if they're assigned a value of an incorrect type? Or do I need to check their type within every function that uses them?"

        "content": "In Python, you can enforce type checking for class attributes by using several techniques. While Python is dynamically typed and doesn't enforce strict type checking like C++, you can achieve similar behavior using property setters, type hints, or third-party libraries. Here are some approaches you can consider:\n\n1. **Using Property Setters**:\n   You can use property setters to enforce type checking whenever an attribute is set. This allows you to raise an exception if the assigned value is not of the expected type.\n\n   ```python\n   class MyClass:\n       def __init__(self):\n           self._int_var = None\n           self._list_var = None\n\n       @property\n       def int_var(self):\n           return self._int_var\n\n       @int_var.setter\n       def int_var(self, value):\n           if not isinstance(value, int):\n               raise TypeError(\"int_var must be an integer\")\n           self._int_var = value\n\n       @property\n       def list_var(self):\n           return self._list_var\n\n       @list_var.setter\n       def list_var(self, value):\n           if not isinstance(value, list):\n               raise TypeError(\"list_var must be a list\")\n           self._list_var = value\n\n   obj = MyClass()\n   obj.int_var = 5  # This is fine\n   obj.list_var = [1, 2, 3]  # This is fine\n   obj.int_var = \"string\"  # Raises TypeError\n   ```\n\n2. **Using Type Hints and Static Type Checkers**:\n   Python 3.5 introduced type hints, which allow you to specify the expected types of variables. While these don't enforce type checking at runtime, you can use static type checkers like `mypy` to verify type correctness before running your program.\n\n   ```python\n   class MyClass:\n       def __init__(self) -> None:\n           self.int_var: int = 0\n           self.list_var: list = []\n\n   obj = MyClass()\n   obj.int_var = 5  # Static type checker will be happy\n   obj.list_var = [1, 2, 3]  # Static type checker will be happy\n   ```\n\n3. **Using Dataclasses with Type Checking Libraries**:\n   Python's `dataclasses` module combined with libraries like `pydantic` or `attrs` can provide runtime type enforcement.\n\n   Using `attrs`:\n   ```python\n   from attrs import define, field, validators\n\n   @define\n   class MyClass:\n       int_var: int = field(validator=validators.instance_of(int))\n       list_var: list = field(validator=validators.instance_of(list))\n\n   obj = MyClass(int_var=5, list_var=[1, 2, 3])  # This is fine\n   # obj = MyClass(int_var=\"string\", list_var=[1, 2, 3])  # Raises TypeError\n   ```\n\n4. **Using Pydantic**:\n   Pydantic is a powerful library for data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.\n\n   ```python\n   from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError\n\n   class MyClass(BaseModel):\n       int_var: int\n       list_var: list\n\n   try:\n       obj = MyClass(int_var=5, list_var=[1, 2, 3])  # This is fine\n       obj = MyClass(int_var=\"string\", list_var=[1, 2, 3])  # Raises ValidationError\n   except ValidationError as e:\n       print(e)\n   ```\n\nEach of these methods has its own advantages and use cases. If you want runtime type enforcement, using property setters or a library like `attrs` or `pydantic` would be effective. If you are interested in catching type issues before running your program, using type hints with a static type checker is a good approach."
