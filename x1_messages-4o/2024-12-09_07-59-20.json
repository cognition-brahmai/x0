The issue I'm having is that the source of the exception points to the line where the re-raise occurred and not where the original exception comes from. How can I modify the main thread so that the original exception line is included in the output? Here's the code I'm currently using:\n\n```python\nimport threading\nimport sys\n\nclass FailingThread(threading.Thread):\n    def run(self):\n        try:\n            raise ValueError('x')\n        except ValueError:\n            self.exc_info = sys.exc_info()\n\nfailingThread = FailingThread()\nfailingThread.start()\nfailingThread.join()\n\nprint failingThread.exc_info\nraise failingThread.exc_info[1]\n```\n\nThe output I get from this is:\n```\n(<type 'exceptions.ValueError'>, ValueError('x',), <traceback object at 0x1004cc320>)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"test.py\", line 16, in <module>\n    raise failingThread.exc_info[1]\n```\n\nBut I want it to read:\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"test.py\", line 7, in <module>\n```"

        "content": "To preserve the original traceback when re-raising an exception from a thread in the main thread, you need to use the traceback object that you captured. Python provides a way to re-raise an exception with its original traceback using the `raise ... from ...` syntax.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired traceback information:\n\n```python\nimport threading\nimport sys\nimport traceback\n\nclass FailingThread(threading.Thread):\n    def run(self):\n        try:\n            raise ValueError('x')\n        except ValueError:\n            self.exc_info = sys.exc_info()\n\nfailingThread = FailingThread()\nfailingThread.start()\nfailingThread.join()\n\nif failingThread.exc_info:\n    exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback = failingThread.exc_info\n    traceback.print_exception(exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback)\n    raise exc_value.with_traceback(exc_traceback)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Thread Exception Capture**: When the exception is captured within the thread, the `sys.exc_info()` function is used to get the exception type, value, and traceback.\n\n2. **Printing the Traceback**: Before raising the exception in the main thread, you can optionally print the full traceback using `traceback.print_exception()`, which takes the exception type, value, and traceback as arguments.\n\n3. **Re-raising with Original Traceback**: Use `exc_value.with_traceback(exc_traceback)` to attach the original traceback to the exception when re-raising it. This ensures that the traceback information is accurate and points to the line where the exception initially occurred.\n\nThis approach ensures that the traceback output will reflect the line in the thread where the exception was originally raised."
