        "content": "Handling large CSV files that don't fit into memory can be challenging, but you can efficiently manage this by using libraries such as `pandas` in combination with `dask`, or by employing tools like `pandas` with an iterator. Here's how you can read a random sample of 10,000 lines from a large CSV file and perform some basic statistics on it:\n\n### Method 1: Using `pandas` with a Chunk Iterator\n\n1. **Read the CSV in chunks**: Use the `chunksize` parameter to read the file in manageable chunks.\n\n2. **Randomly sample from each chunk**: Collect samples from each chunk until you accumulate the desired sample size.\n\n3. **Perform statistics**: Once your sample is ready, perform the desired statistical analysis.\n\nHere's a sample implementation:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef sample_large_csv(file_path, sample_size=10000, chunksize=1000):\n    # Create an iterable reader object\n    reader = pd.read_csv(file_path, chunksize=chunksize)\n\n    # List to store the sample data frames\n    sample_df_list = []\n\n    # Iterate over chunks\n    for chunk in reader:\n        # Randomly sample from the chunk\n        sample_chunk = chunk.sample(n=min(len(chunk), sample_size), random_state=1)\n        sample_df_list.append(sample_chunk)\n\n        # Reduce the required sample size\n        sample_size -= len(sample_chunk)\n        if sample_size <= 0:\n            break\n\n    # Concatenate all the sampled chunks to form the final sample data frame\n    sample_df = pd.concat(sample_df_list, ignore_index=True)\n\n    return sample_df\n\n# File path to the large CSV\nfile_path = 'large_file.csv'\n\n# Get a random sample\nsample_df = sample_large_csv(file_path)\n\n# Perform some simple statistics\nprint(\"Sample Statistics:\")\nprint(sample_df.describe())\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using `dask` for Lazy Evaluation\n\n`dask` is a powerful library that allows you to work with data that doesn't fit into memory by using lazy evaluation.\n\n```python\nimport dask.dataframe as dd\n\n# Read the large CSV using dask\nddf = dd.read_csv('large_file.csv')\n\n# Randomly sample 10,000 rows\nsample_df = ddf.sample(frac=10000/len(ddf), random_state=1).compute()\n\n# Perform statistics\nprint(\"Sample Statistics:\")\nprint(sample_df.describe())\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Chunk Size**: Adjust the `chunksize` based on your system\u2019s memory capacity to optimize performance.\n\n- **Random Sampling**: Ensure randomness by setting a `random_state`. This guarantees reproducibility.\n\n- **Statistics**: Use `DataFrame.describe()` for a quick statistical summary (mean, std, min, max, etc.).\n\nThese methods will allow you to efficiently handle large CSV files and extract meaningful insights from a random sample."
