I am looking for a method that works similar to this example:\n\n```python\nimport some_time_library\n\nstarttime = some_time_library.some_module()\ncode_tobe_measured() \nendtime = some_time_library.some_module()\n\ntime_taken = endtime - starttime\n```"

        "content": "In Python, you can measure the time taken between lines of code using the `time` module. Here's how you can accomplish this task:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\n# Record the start time\nstarttime = time.time()\n\n# Code to be measured\ncode_tobe_measured()\n\n# Record the end time\nendtime = time.time()\n\n# Calculate the time taken\ntime_taken = endtime - starttime\nprint(f\"Time taken: {time_taken} seconds\")\n```\n\nThe `time.time()` function returns the current time in seconds since the epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC). By capturing the time before and after the execution of the code block you're interested in, you can calculate the time difference to determine how long the code took to execute.\n\nIf you need more precision, you can use the `timeit` module, which is specifically designed for timing small code snippets with higher accuracy:\n\n```python\nimport timeit\n\ndef code_tobe_measured():\n    # Your code here\n    pass\n\n# Measure the execution time\ntime_taken = timeit.timeit(code_tobe_measured, number=1)\nprint(f\"Time taken: {time_taken} seconds\")\n```\n\nIn this example, `timeit.timeit` runs the `code_tobe_measured` function and returns the time it took to execute. The `number` parameter specifies how many times the code should be executed, and in this case, it's set to `1` for a single execution. For more accurate timing, especially for very short code snippets, you might want to run the code multiple times and take an average."
