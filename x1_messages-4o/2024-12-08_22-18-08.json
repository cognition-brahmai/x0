Tsunami\n2. Rip current\n3. Rogue wave\n4. Swell\nDescriptions:\nA. These waves are characterized by their long wavelength and smooth, rolling motion. They are often seen in open ocean and can travel great distances.\nB. These waves are caused by sudden changes in water depth and can sweep unsuspecting swimmers out to sea.\nC. These waves are abnormally large and unpredictable, often causing damage to ships and coastal structures.\nD. These waves are caused by seismic activity and can reach heights of up to 100 feet.\nClues:\n- Wave type #1 is the result of a powerful earthquake or underwater landslide.\n- Wave type #2 is a strong, narrow current that flows outward from the shore and can be difficult to spot.\n- Wave type #3 is often described as a \"freak wave\" and can appear out of nowhere in the middle of the ocean.\n- Wave type #4 is the result of distant storms and can create ideal surfing conditions on beaches. \nWhich wave types do you think can have a significant impact on beachgoers? List them in order from the most dangerous to the most benign."
