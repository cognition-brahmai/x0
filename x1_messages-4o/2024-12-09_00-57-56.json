        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to the compatibility and installation of the SciPy and NumPy libraries in your Python environment. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check NumPy Installation:**\n   - Ensure that NumPy is properly installed and that you have the right version. NumPy MKL refers to a version of NumPy that is linked against the Intel Math Kernel Library, which provides optimized mathematical routines. You can try reinstalling NumPy with MKL support.\n\n2. **Update or Reinstall Packages:**\n   - Open a command prompt and run the following commands to update or reinstall NumPy and SciPy:\n     ```bash\n     pip uninstall numpy scipy\n     pip install numpy scipy\n     ```\n\n3. **Use a Compatible Python Version:**\n   - Python 2.7 is quite old and has reached end-of-life. If possible, consider upgrading to Python 3.x, which is actively maintained and has better library support.\n\n4. **Install Precompiled Binaries:**\n   - You can use precompiled binaries for NumPy and SciPy that are optimized for Windows. Websites like [Gohlke's Pythonlibs](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) provide Windows binaries for many packages. Download the appropriate `.whl` file for your system and install it using pip:\n     ```bash\n     pip install path\\to\\numpy\u20111.xx.x+mkl\u2011cp27\u2011cp27m\u2011win_amd64.whl\n     pip install path\\to\\scipy\u20111.xx.x\u2011cp27\u2011cp27m\u2011win_amd64.whl\n     ```\n\n5. **Create a Virtual Environment:**\n   - Use a virtual environment to manage your dependencies separately from the system Python installation:\n     ```bash\n     python -m pip install virtualenv\n     python -m virtualenv myenv\n     myenv\\Scripts\\activate\n     pip install numpy scipy\n     ```\n\n6. **Check Your PATH:**\n   - Ensure that your Python PATH is correctly set and points to the Python version and environment you intend to use.\n\n7. **Consider Anaconda:**\n   - If issues persist, consider using Anaconda, a Python distribution that comes with many scientific libraries pre-installed and configured, which can simplify package management.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the import error and run your code successfully. If you continue to face issues, please provide additional details about any error messages you encounter during these steps."
