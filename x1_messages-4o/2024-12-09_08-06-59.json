The initiation code I've used is as follows:\n\n```\nfrom plotly.offline import download_plotlyjs, init_notebook_mode, iplot\ninit_notebook_mode(connected=True)\n```\n\nFollowing this, I am attempting to display a plot using the code:\n\n```\ntrace0 = plotly.graph_objs.Scatter(\n    x=[1, 2, 3, 4],\n    y=[10, 15, 13, 17]\n)\ntrace1 = plotly.graph_objs.Scatter(\n    x=[1, 2, 3, 4],\n    y=[16, 5, 11, 9]\n)\n\niplot([trace0, trace1])\n```\n\nHowever, when I run this, I'm only getting a large empty space in the cell output area, as shown in this screenshot: https://i.stack.imgur.com/4ghrI.png. I'm not sure why this is not working with Jupyter Lab. Can you please help me fix this issue so I can display plots using plot.ly offline in Jupyter Lab?"

        "content": "To use Plotly in Jupyter Lab, you need to ensure that you have the appropriate extensions installed and enabled. Unlike Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab requires a few additional steps because it utilizes a different system for rendering JavaScript.\n\nHere's how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Install Plotly and its Dependencies**:\n   Make sure you have Plotly and its dependencies installed. You can do this using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install plotly\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Node.js**:\n   Jupyter Lab extensions are built using Node.js, so ensure that it is installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).\n\n3. **Install jupyterlab and plotly extensions**:\n   You'll need to install the Plotly Jupyter Lab extension:\n\n   ```bash\n   jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager plotlywidget\n   ```\n\n4. **Rebuild Jupyter Lab**:\n   After installing the extensions, rebuild Jupyter Lab:\n\n   ```bash\n   jupyter lab build\n   ```\n\n5. **Restart Jupyter Lab**:\n   Close and reopen Jupyter Lab to ensure all changes take effect.\n\n6. **Use Plotly with Jupyter Lab**:\n   Now, you should be able to use Plotly's offline mode in Jupyter Lab. Use the same code you provided:\n\n   ```python\n   from plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode, iplot\n   import plotly.graph_objs as go\n\n   init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\n\n   trace0 = go.Scatter(\n       x=[1, 2, 3, 4],\n       y=[10, 15, 13, 17]\n   )\n   trace1 = go.Scatter(\n       x=[1, 2, 3, 4],\n       y=[16, 5, 11, 9]\n   )\n\n   iplot([trace0, trace1])\n   ```\n\n7. **Verify Plotly Extension**:\n   If the issue persists, verify that the Plotly extension is correctly installed by checking the list of installed extensions:\n\n   ```bash\n   jupyter labextension list\n   ```\n\n   Ensure that `@jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager` and `plotlywidget` are listed as enabled.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and display Plotly plots in Jupyter Lab."
