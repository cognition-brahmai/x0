However, when I try to run the command on one machine (Linux distribution Slackware 14.1), the installation fails with an error stating \"torch-0.1.6.post17-cp27-cp27mu-linux_x86_64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.\" In contrast, the installation succeeds on another machine (Ubuntu 15.10). I think the issue is related to the 'cp27mu' in the wheel name. When I run the command 'import pip; print(pip.pep425tags.get_supported())' from the Python shell, I receive different outputs from the Slackware machine and the Ubuntu machine. I understand from https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/ that whether 'cp27m' or 'cp27mu' is supported depends on an option passed at compile time, '--enable-unicode'. Does this mean that I need to compile Python with the '--enable-unicode=ucs4' on the Slackware machine to install that wheel?"

        "content": "Yes, your understanding is correct. The error you're encountering is due to a mismatch in the Unicode support of the Python build on your Slackware machine. The 'cp27m' and 'cp27mu' tags refer to Python 2.7 builds with different Unicode configurations. 'cp27m' corresponds to a Python build with narrow Unicode (UCS2) support, whereas 'cp27mu' corresponds to a build with wide Unicode (UCS4) support.\n\nThe error message indicates that the wheel you are trying to install is built for a Python interpreter with UCS4 Unicode support ('cp27mu'), but it seems your Slackware machine's Python interpreter is built with UCS2 Unicode support ('cp27m').\n\nTo resolve this issue, you have a couple of options:\n\n1. **Recompile Python with UCS4 Support**: You can recompile Python on your Slackware machine with the `--enable-unicode=ucs4` option to enable wide Unicode support. This should allow you to use wheels that are built with 'cp27mu'.\n\n   Here\u2019s a general guide on how to recompile Python with UCS4 support:\n\n   ```bash\n   # Download the Python source code\n   wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.X/Python-2.7.X.tgz\n   tar xzf Python-2.7.X.tgz\n   cd Python-2.7.X\n\n   # Configure with UCS4 support\n   ./configure --enable-unicode=ucs4\n   make\n   sudo make install\n   ```\n\n   Replace `2.7.X` with the specific version of Python you wish to install.\n\n2. **Use a Compatible Wheel or Source Installation**: Alternatively, if recompiling Python is not feasible, you can try to find a compatible wheel for your current Python setup ('cp27m') or install PyTorch from source, which would compile the package according to the current Python environment on your machine.\n\n3. **Upgrade Python**: Since Python 2.7 is no longer supported, consider upgrading to a more recent version of Python, which might be easier to manage and support recent packages.\n\nRemember to back up your current setup or work in a virtual environment to avoid disrupting your existing Python environment."
