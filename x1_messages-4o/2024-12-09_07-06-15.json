My current code is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef egg():\n    return \"egg\"\n\ndef egg2(arg1, arg2):\n    print arg1\n    print arg2\n\nargList = [\"egg1\", \"egg2\"]\narg = ', '.join(argList)\n\negg2(arg.split())\n```\nHowever, the line `egg2(arg.split())` isn't functioning as expected and I'm unsure how to proceed. How can I dynamically split the list values and pass them as individual parameters to a function, similar to calling `egg2(argList[0], argList[1])` but without having to explicitly type the list arguments?"

        "content": "In Python, when you want to pass elements of a list as separate arguments to a function, you can use the unpacking operator `*`. This operator allows you to unpack the elements of a list (or any iterable) and pass them as individual arguments. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\ndef egg():\n    return \"egg\"\n\ndef egg2(arg1, arg2):\n    print(arg1)\n    print(arg2)\n\nargList = [\"egg1\", \"egg2\"]\n\n# Use the unpacking operator * to pass the list elements as separate arguments\negg2(*argList)\n```\n\nThis way, `egg2(*argList)` effectively translates to `egg2(argList[0], argList[1])`, passing each element of `argList` as a separate argument to `egg2`. Note that I've also updated the `print` statements to be compatible with Python 3, by adding parentheses."
