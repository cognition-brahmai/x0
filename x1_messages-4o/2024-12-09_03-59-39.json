        "content": "Is it possible to perform incremental training on data using MLlib in Apache Spark? I'm using Prediction IO, a wrapper for Spark, HBase, ElasticSearch among other Restful parts. Can I do incremental training during the \"predict\" phase? My application inserts \"events\" in real-time, but to get updated prediction results I need to execute \"pio train\" and \"pio deploy\", which takes some time and the server goes offline during the redeployment. I am not able to find an answer to this."

        "content": "Incremental training in Apache Spark's MLlib is not natively supported in the same way that batch training is. MLlib is primarily designed for batch processing, meaning that it processes entire datasets at once rather than updating models incrementally as new data comes in. However, there are some strategies you can consider to achieve something similar to incremental training:\n\n1. **Micro-batching with Spark Streaming**: If you're using Spark Streaming, you can implement micro-batch training. This involves periodically retraining your model with new batches of data. Although this isn't true online learning, it allows you to update your model more frequently than traditional batch processing. You can set up a pipeline to periodically load new data, retrain your model, and deploy it.\n\n2. **Online Learning Algorithms**: Some machine learning algorithms are inherently designed for online learning, where they can update their model incrementally with new data. However, MLlib does not natively support online learning algorithms. You might need to look at other libraries like Vowpal Wabbit or MOA (Massive Online Analysis) for true online learning capabilities.\n\n3. **Model Update with New Data**: You can periodically update your model with new data, but this will involve retraining the model with both the old and new data. This can be automated to happen at certain intervals or triggered by certain conditions.\n\n4. **Use of PredictionIO's Event Server**: PredictionIO itself does not support incremental training in the strictest sense. However, you can leverage PredictionIO's Event Server to collect new events in real-time. You can then schedule periodic retraining jobs that incorporate the new events into your model.\n\n5. **Asynchronous Model Deployment**: To avoid downtime during redeployment, you can look into methods for deploying models asynchronously. This might involve running separate training and prediction services or using a model management solution that allows for seamless model updates without taking the server offline.\n\nTo integrate these strategies, you'll likely need to build some custom logic around your PredictionIO setup and take advantage of Spark's capabilities for streaming and micro-batching. While it might not be true incremental learning, these approaches can help you minimize downtime and update your models more frequently with new data."
