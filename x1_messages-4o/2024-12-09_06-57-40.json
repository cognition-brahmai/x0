Here's the current code I'm using:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')\nax.set_zlabel('label text flipped', rotation=90) \nax.azim = 225\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis results in a plot with the z-label reading from top to bottom. I want this label orientation to hold no matter what my `ax.azim` setting is. I found an old feature request on github regarding this issue but there doesn't seem to be any progress on it. Is there a workaround for this issue?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired orientation for the z-label in a 3D matplotlib plot, you can use a workaround by manually setting the label properties. Since `ax.set_zlabel()` does not currently support flipping the text orientation directly, you can use the `ax.text()` method to place and orient the z-label text manually. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')\n\n# Hide the default z-axis label\nax.set_zlabel('')\n\n# Add a custom z-axis label with the desired orientation\nax.text2D(0.95, 0.5, 'label text flipped', transform=ax.transAxes, \n          rotation=90, verticalalignment='center', \n          horizontalalignment='right', fontsize=10)\n\n# Set azimuth\nax.azim = 225\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `ax.set_zlabel('')` is used to hide the default z-label.\n- `ax.text2D()` is used to add a custom text label oriented as desired. The `transform=ax.transAxes` ensures the label is placed in data coordinates relative to the axes.\n- `rotation=90` is used to rotate the text, and you can adjust `horizontalalignment` and `verticalalignment` to position the label correctly.\n\nYou can tweak the `text2D` parameters further to achieve the exact positioning and appearance you want, regardless of the azimuth setting."
