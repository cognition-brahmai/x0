        "content": "To ensure that the file name is unique when saving a file to a server, you can prepend a randomly generated string. One efficient way to do this in Python is by using the `uuid` module, which generates universally unique identifiers. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport uuid\nimport os\n\ndef save_file_with_random_prefix(file_path, server_directory):\n    # Generate a random UUID string\n    random_prefix = str(uuid.uuid4())\n    \n    # Get the original file name\n    original_file_name = os.path.basename(file_path)\n\n    # Create a new file name with the random prefix\n    new_file_name = f\"{random_prefix}_{original_file_name}\"\n    \n    # Define the full path on the server\n    server_file_path = os.path.join(server_directory, new_file_name)\n    \n    # Save the file to the server (this is a placeholder for your actual file saving logic)\n    with open(file_path, 'rb') as original_file:\n        with open(server_file_path, 'wb') as server_file:\n            server_file.write(original_file.read())\n    \n    return server_file_path\n\n# Example usage\nfile_path = \"path/to/local/file.txt\"\nserver_directory = \"path/to/server/directory\"\nnew_file_path = save_file_with_random_prefix(file_path, server_directory)\nprint(f\"File saved to: {new_file_path}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **UUID Generation**: The `uuid.uuid4()` function generates a random UUID, which is highly unlikely to collide with any existing UUID. It's a great way to ensure uniqueness.\n2. **File Name Construction**: The original file name is combined with the UUID to create a new, unique file name.\n3. **File Saving**: The file is read from its original location and written to the server with the new unique name.\n\nThis approach is efficient and straightforward, making it suitable for ensuring that your files do not overwrite each other on the server."
