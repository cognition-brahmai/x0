However, I am encountering an unexpected output. Here's the code that I'm using:\n\n```python\n#!/bin/env python\n#coding: utf-8\n\na = [lambda: i for i in range(5)]\nfor i in a:\n    print i()\n```\n\nThe output I'm getting is:\n\n```python\n<function <lambda> at 0x7f489e542e60>\n<function <lambda> at 0x7f489e542ed8>\n<function <lambda> at 0x7f489e542f50>\n<function <lambda> at 0x7f489e54a050>\n<function <lambda> at 0x7f489e54a0c8>\n```\n\nWhen I modify the variable name when printing the call result to `t`, everything seems to work fine. Here's the modified code:\n\n```python\na = [lambda: i for i in range(5)]\nfor t in a:\n    print t()\n```\n\nThe output in this case is:\n\n```python\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n```\n\nI am confused about this behavior. Could you explain why this is happening?"

        "content": "The behavior you are encountering is due to the way closures and late binding work in Python. In your original code, the lambda functions are capturing the variable `i` from the surrounding scope. By the time you call these lambda functions in the loop, the value of `i` has already been updated to the last value in the range, which is `4`.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening:\n\n1. The list comprehension `[lambda: i for i in range(5)]` creates a list of lambda functions. Each lambda function captures the variable `i` from the surrounding scope.\n2. The loop iterates through each lambda function, and when you call `i()` inside the loop, it refers to the same `i` from the outer scope, which ends up being `4` after the list comprehension finishes executing.\n\nWhen you modify your code to use `t` instead of `i`, it does not change this behavior because `t` is simply the loop variable used to iterate over the list of functions and doesn't impact the captured variable.\n\nTo fix this issue and get each lambda function to capture its own value of `i`, you can use a default argument in the lambda function, which will bind the current value of `i` at each iteration:\n\n```python\na = [lambda i=i: i for i in range(5)]\nfor func in a:\n    print(func())\n```\n\nIn this modified version, each lambda function has a default argument `i=i`, which captures the current value of `i` during each iteration of the list comprehension. When you call each function, it will then return the correct value (`0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`)."
