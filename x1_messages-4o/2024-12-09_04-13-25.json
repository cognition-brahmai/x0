Here is my code:\n```python\ndef cube(number):\n  return number^3\nprint cube(2)\n```\nI anticipated the output of `cube(2)` to be 8, but I am receiving 1 instead. Could you help me understand what I am doing wrong?"

In Python, the `^` operator is used for bitwise XOR operations, which is not what you want for exponentiation.\n\nHere is the corrected code using the exponentiation operator (`**`):\n\n```python\ndef cube(number):\n    return number ** 3\n\nprint(cube(2))\n```\n\nWith this change, `cube(2)` will correctly return `8`, as `2` raised to the power of `3` is `8`."
