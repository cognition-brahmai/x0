The Windows users generally do not pay attention to case while naming the files. Is there a method available in Python to handle this on the Linux side? In other words, can I achieve a case-insensitive, glob-like behavior?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve case-insensitive file matching in Python on a Linux system by using the `fnmatch` module in combination with a custom case-insensitive pattern matching function. The `glob` module itself does not support case-insensitivity directly, but you can emulate this behavior.\n\nHere's a way to achieve case-insensitive glob-like behavior using `os`, `fnmatch`, and `os.path`:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport fnmatch\n\ndef case_insensitive_glob(directory, pattern):\n    # Convert the pattern to lowercase\n    pattern = pattern.lower()\n\n    # List to store matched files\n    matched_files = []\n\n    # Walk through the directory\n    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):\n        for filename in files:\n            # Check if the file matches the pattern in a case-insensitive manner\n            if fnmatch.fnmatch(filename.lower(), pattern):\n                # Add the full path of the matched file to the list\n                matched_files.append(os.path.join(root, filename))\n\n    return matched_files\n\n# Usage example\ndirectory_path = '/path/to/directory'\npattern = '*.txt'\nmatched_files = case_insensitive_glob(directory_path, pattern)\n\nfor file in matched_files:\n    print(file)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Lowercase Conversion:** The pattern is converted to lowercase. Each filename is also converted to lowercase before matching to ensure case-insensitivity.\n- **`os.walk()`:** This function is used to traverse the directory tree. It yields a tuple of root, directories, and files, allowing you to process each file.\n- **`fnmatch.fnmatch()`:** This function is used to check if a filename matches a specified pattern. By converting both the filename and pattern to lowercase, it achieves case-insensitive matching.\n\nThis script will provide you with a list of files that match the given pattern, regardless of the case used in their filenames. Adjust the `directory_path` and `pattern` as needed for your specific use case."
