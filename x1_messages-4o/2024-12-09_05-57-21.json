        "content": "Certainly! The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a powerful library in Python for working with human language data. Here are some basic examples and applications that you can use to get started:\n\n1. **Tokenization**:\n   Tokenization is the process of breaking down a text into smaller units, like words or sentences.\n   ```python\n   import nltk\n   from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize\n\n   text = \"Hello! How are you doing today? Let's learn NLTK.\"\n   words = word_tokenize(text)\n   sentences = sent_tokenize(text)\n\n   print(\"Words:\", words)\n   print(\"Sentences:\", sentences)\n   ```\n\n2. **Stop Words Removal**:\n   Stop words are commonly used words (such as \"the\", \"is\", \"in\") that a model might ignore.\n   ```python\n   from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n\n   stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n   words = [\"Hello\", \"how\", \"are\", \"you\", \"doing\", \"today\"]\n   filtered_words = [word for word in words if word.lower() not in stop_words]\n\n   print(\"Filtered Words:\", filtered_words)\n   ```\n\n3. **Stemming**:\n   Stemming is the process of reducing words to their base or root form.\n   ```python\n   from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer\n\n   stemmer = PorterStemmer()\n   words = [\"running\", \"runs\", \"ran\", \"easily\", \"fairly\"]\n   stemmed_words = [stemmer.stem(word) for word in words]\n\n   print(\"Stemmed Words:\", stemmed_words)\n   ```\n\n4. **POS Tagging**:\n   Part-of-speech tagging is the process of labeling words with their part of speech.\n   ```python\n   import nltk\n\n   sentence = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\n   words = nltk.word_tokenize(sentence)\n   pos_tags = nltk.pos_tag(words)\n\n   print(\"POS Tags:\", pos_tags)\n   ```\n\n5. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**:\n   NER is used to identify entities like names, places, and organizations in text.\n   ```python\n   import nltk\n\n   sentence = \"Barack Obama was born in Hawaii.\"\n   words = nltk.word_tokenize(sentence)\n   pos_tags = nltk.pos_tag(words)\n   named_entities = nltk.ne_chunk(pos_tags)\n\n   print(\"Named Entities:\", named_entities)\n   ```\n\n6. **Frequency Distribution**:\n   This can help you find the most common words or patterns in a text.\n   ```python\n   from nltk.probability import FreqDist\n\n   words = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\", \"apple\"]\n   freq_dist = FreqDist(words)\n\n   print(\"Frequency Distribution:\", freq_dist.most_common(2))\n   ```\n\nThese examples cover some foundational operations you can perform with NLTK. As you become more comfortable, you can explore more advanced topics such as parsing, machine translation, and text classification."
