I have a NumPy array like `[a b c]` and I want to append it to an existing NumPy array. However, when I tried the following code, I encountered an error.\n```python\nM = np.array([])\nM.append(a, axis=0)\n```\nThe error message that was returned is:\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nAttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'append'\n```\nThe array `a` is defined as:\n```python\na = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that NumPy arrays do not have an `append` method like Python lists do. Instead, you can use the `numpy.append` function to concatenate arrays. However, `numpy.append` returns a new array and does not modify the original array `M` in place.\n\nIf you want to create a list of NumPy arrays, you can initialize an empty Python list and then append the NumPy arrays to this list. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the initial array\na = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n\n# Initialize an empty list to hold NumPy arrays\nM = []\n\n# Append the array 'a' to the list 'M'\nM.append(a)\n\n# If you want to append another array, you can do so similarly\nb = np.array([4, 5, 6])\nM.append(b)\n\n# Now M is a list containing two NumPy arrays\nprint(M)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[array([1, 2, 3]), array([4, 5, 6])]\n```\n\nIn this example, `M` is a list that contains multiple NumPy arrays. You can append as many arrays as you want to `M` using the list's `append` method."
