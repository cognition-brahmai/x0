For instance, I have a function `is_in` which appends a character to a list:\n\n```python\ndef is_in(char):\n    my_list = []\n    my_list.append(char)\n```\n\nI attempted to write a test case for it, but I am unsure of what to assert the function equals, given that it doesn't return a value:\n\n```python\nclass TestIsIn(unittest.TestCase):\n\n    def test_one(self):\n    ''' Test if one character was added to the list'''\n    self.assertEqual(self.is_in('a'), # And this is where I am lost)\n```\n\nWould the `assertIn` method work in this situation?"

        "content": "To effectively test a function that modifies a list but doesn't return anything, you need to modify the function so that you can access the list from outside the function. One way to achieve this is by passing the list as an argument to the function. Here's how you can modify the function and write a corresponding unit test:\n\n### Modified Function\n\n```python\ndef is_in(char, my_list):\n    my_list.append(char)\n```\n\n### Unit Test\n\nNow you can write a unit test using the `unittest` framework. You can use the `assertIn` method to check if the character was added to the list.\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\nclass TestIsIn(unittest.TestCase):\n\n    def test_one(self):\n        # Create an empty list\n        my_list = []\n        # Call the function with the character and the list\n        is_in('a', my_list)\n        # Use assertIn to check if 'a' is in the list\n        self.assertIn('a', my_list)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Function Modification**: The `is_in` function now takes an additional parameter, `my_list`, which allows it to modify the list passed to it.\n- **Testing with `assertIn`**: In the test, you create an empty list, pass it to `is_in`, and then use `assertIn` to verify that the character `'a'` was successfully added to the list.\n\nThis way, you test the side effect of the function (modifying the list) rather than expecting a return value."
