        "content": "I am trying to train a LightGBM model with a custom metric, specifically the `f1_score` with a `weighted` average. In implementing this, I referred to the advanced examples provided by LightGBM. However, I am encountering a `ValueError` stating `Found input variables with inconsistent numbers of samples`. The issue seems to be that the training set is being passed to the function instead of the validation set. How can I configure my code to ensure that the validation set is passed and the `f1_score` is returned?\n\nHere is the code I have so far:\n\n```\ndef f1_metric(preds, train_data):\n    labels = train_data.get_label()\n    return 'f1', f1_score(labels, preds, average='weighted'), True\n\nevals_results = {}\n\nbst = lgb.train(params, \n                     dtrain, \n                     valid_sets= [dvalid], \n                     valid_names=['valid'], \n                     evals_result=evals_results, \n                     num_boost_round=num_boost_round,\n                     early_stopping_rounds=early_stopping_rounds,\n                     verbose_eval=25, \n                     feval=f1_metric)\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, `ValueError: Found input variables with inconsistent numbers of samples`, suggests that there is a mismatch between the number of predictions (`preds`) and the number of labels in your validation data. This typically happens because LightGBM provides raw predictions, not class labels, to the custom evaluation function. You need to convert these raw predictions into class labels before calculating the F1 score. Here's how you can modify your `f1_metric` function to address this:\n\n1. Ensure that the predictions are converted to class labels by using a thresholding mechanism or by selecting the class with the highest predicted probability.\n\n2. Make sure that the `average` parameter in `f1_score` is set to `'weighted'`, as you have mentioned.\n\nHere is the modified code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport lightgbm as lgb\nfrom sklearn.metrics import f1_score\n\ndef f1_metric(preds, train_data):\n    # Get true labels\n    labels = train_data.get_label()\n    \n    # Convert raw prediction scores to predicted class labels\n    # If it's binary classification, preds contains probabilities for the positive class\n    # For binary classification:\n    preds_binary = np.round(preds)  # Assuming binary classification with threshold 0.5\n    # For multi-class classification:\n    # preds_binary = np.argmax(preds.reshape(len(labels), -1), axis=1)\n\n    # Calculate F1 score using the weighted average\n    f1 = f1_score(labels, preds_binary, average='weighted')\n    \n    # Return the metric name, value, and whether higher is better (True for F1 score)\n    return 'f1', f1, True\n\nevals_results = {}\n\nbst = lgb.train(params, \n                     dtrain, \n                     valid_sets=[dvalid], \n                     valid_names=['valid'], \n                     evals_result=evals_results, \n                     num_boost_round=num_boost_round,\n                     early_stopping_rounds=early_stopping_rounds,\n                     verbose_eval=25, \n                     feval=f1_metric)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Binary Classification**: If it's a binary classification problem, raw predictions are probabilities for the positive class, which can be converted to class labels using a threshold (commonly 0.5).\n\n- **Multi-Class Classification**: If it's multi-class classification, you need to reshape `preds` to the shape `(num_samples, num_classes)` and use `np.argmax` to determine the predicted class for each sample.\n\n- **Custom Metric Function**: Always ensure that your custom metric function returns three values: the name of the metric, the computed metric value, and a boolean indicating whether higher values are better.\n\nThis setup should resolve the mismatch issue and provide you with an F1 score on the validation set during training."
