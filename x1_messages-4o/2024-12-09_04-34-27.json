        "content": "Yes, in Python, you can catch all exceptions by using a bare `except` clause. However, it's generally recommended to use this approach cautiously because it can catch unexpected exceptions, including those that you might not want to handle, such as system exit calls. Here's how you can catch any exception:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Your code that might raise an exception\n    risky_operation()\nexcept Exception as e:\n    # Fallback action for any exception\n    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n```\n\nIn this example, `Exception` is the base class for all built-in exceptions except for system-exiting exceptions like `SystemExit`, `KeyboardInterrupt`, and `GeneratorExit`. By catching `Exception`, you ensure that most runtime errors are handled.\n\nIf you want to catch absolutely every possible exception, including those mentioned above, you can use a bare `except`:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Your code that might raise an exception\n    risky_operation()\nexcept:\n    # Fallback action for any exception\n    print(\"An error occurred\")\n```\n\nAgain, use this with caution, as it can make debugging difficult by hiding the cause of unexpected program exits."
