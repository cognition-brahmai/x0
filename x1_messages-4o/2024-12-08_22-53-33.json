Please provide a [Python code] that generates a 30-minute high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workout plan that incorporates running and cycling. The workout should consist of 5 cycles, each with a duration of 6 minutes. In each cycle, the client should alternate between running and cycling for 30 seconds each, with a 30-second rest in between. The running speed should be 10 km/h and the cycling speed should be 30 km/h. The workout plan should be displayed in a user-friendly format, indicating the duration and type of each exercise, as well as the rest period."
