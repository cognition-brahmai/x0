        "content": "You can create a Python function that converts bytes into a more human-readable format by using a series of conditional checks to determine the appropriate unit (bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, etc.) and then formatting the number accordingly. Here's a simple function that does just that:\n\n```python\ndef human_readable_bytes(num_bytes):\n    # Define the units and boundaries\n    units = ['bytes', 'kilobytes', 'megabytes', 'gigabytes', 'terabytes', 'petabytes', 'exabytes']\n    boundary = 1024.0\n    \n    # Handle the special case of 1 byte\n    if num_bytes == 1:\n        return '1 byte'\n    \n    # Iterate over the units and convert the number of bytes\n    for unit in units:\n        if num_bytes < boundary:\n            return f\"{num_bytes:.2f} {unit}\"\n        num_bytes /= boundary\n\n    # If the number is excessively large, it falls into the largest unit\n    return f\"{num_bytes:.2f} {units[-1]}\"\n\n# Example usage\nprint(human_readable_bytes(2048))  # Output: \"2.00 kilobytes\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Units and Boundary**: The function defines a list of units ranging from bytes to exabytes. The `boundary` is set to 1024, which is the standard conversion factor between these units.\n- **Special Case for Singular Byte**: The function checks if the input is exactly 1 byte and returns \"1 byte\" to handle singularity correctly.\n- **Conversion Loop**: The function iterates over each unit, dividing the number of bytes by 1024 until it finds the appropriate unit where the size is less than 1024. It then formats the number to two decimal places for better readability.\n- **Handling Large Values**: If the number of bytes is extremely large, the loop will eventually use the largest unit available.\n\nThis function will provide a human-friendly representation of byte sizes, making it easier to understand large numbers."
