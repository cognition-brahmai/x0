        "content": "I am attempting to run a command from a bash script which includes single quotes, additional commands within these quotes, and a variable. The command is in the format `repo forall -c '....$variable'`. However, in this format, the dollar sign is escaped and the variable is not expanded. I've tried various alternatives, such as `repo forall -c '....\"$variable\" '`, `repo forall -c \" '....$variable' \"`, `\" repo forall -c '....$variable' \"`, and `repo forall -c \"'\" ....$variable \"'\"`, but these are all rejected. If I manually substitute the value in place of the variable, the command executes correctly. Where am I going wrong?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to how Bash handles variable expansion within quoted strings. When you enclose a command in single quotes (`'...'`), Bash treats everything inside the quotes as a literal string, which means it does not perform variable expansion.\n\nTo solve this problem, you can use double quotes for the part of the string where you want variable expansion to occur. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```bash\nrepo forall -c \"...\\\"$variable\\\"...\"\n```\n\nIn this version, `\"` allows variable expansion, and the backslashes `\\` are used to escape any double quotes inside the command that need to be treated as literal quotes.\n\nIf you need to mix single and double quotes, you can also break the string into parts:\n\n```bash\nrepo forall -c '...'\"$variable\"'...'\n```\n\nHere, the string is broken into three parts:\n- `'...'` for the literal parts of the command that don't require expansion.\n- `\"$variable\"` for the part where you need the variable to be expanded.\n- `'...'` for any remaining literal parts.\n\nUsing this method should allow your variable to be correctly expanded while maintaining the structure of your original command. Adjust the placement of the quotes and concatenation as needed to fit the exact structure of your command."
