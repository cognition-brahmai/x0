        "content": "To remove the x-axis ticks and labels but keep the vertical grid lines, you can modify your code to set the x-ticks to an empty list while ensuring the grid is still enabled. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nfigr = fig.add_subplot(211)\n\n# Some example data\nfigr.plot([1, 2, 3, 4], [10, 20, 25, 30])\n\n# Set x-ticks to an empty list to hide them\nfigr.set_xticks([])\n\n# Enable the grid\nfigr.xaxis.grid(True)\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what the code does:\n\n- `figr.set_xticks([])`: This line sets the x-ticks to an empty list, effectively hiding them from the plot.\n- `figr.xaxis.grid(True)`: This ensures that the grid lines are shown for the x-axis. Note that if you still want the y-axis grid, you can also use `figr.yaxis.grid(True)`.\n\nWith these changes, the x-axis ticks and labels will be hidden, but the vertical grid lines will still be visible."
