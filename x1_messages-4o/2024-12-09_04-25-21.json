Here's how you can iterate through the items in the `pets` and `marks` lists:\n\n```python\npets = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish']\nmarks = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n\n# Iterating over the 'pets' list\nfor pet in pets:\n    print(pet)\n\n# Iterating over the 'marks' list\nfor mark in marks:\n    print(mark)\n```\n\nIn each of these loops, the variable (`pet` or `mark`) takes on the value of each element in the list, one at a time. You can then perform any operations you need with that element inside the loop."
