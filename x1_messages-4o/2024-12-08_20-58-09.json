        "content": "To construct a rotation matrix that rotates points by \\(2\\pi/3\\) radians counterclockwise, we start with the standard 2D rotation matrix formula. The matrix is defined as:\n\n\\[\nR(\\theta) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos(\\theta) & -\\sin(\\theta) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta) & \\cos(\\theta) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(\\theta = 2\\pi/3\\), we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\cos(2\\pi/3) = -\\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\sin(2\\pi/3) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\]\n\nThus, the rotation matrix \\(R\\) is:\n\n\\[\nR = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2} \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nTo satisfy the condition of having integer entries, we'll scale the matrix by a constant factor that will make all elements integers. Notice that multiplying by 2 gives:\n\n\\[\nR' = 2 \\times \\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & -\\sqrt{3} \\\\ \\sqrt{3} & -1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nTo convert \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) to an integer, we approximate it using the smallest integer matrix that maintains the properties required. We can try \\(\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732\\), which rounds to 2. Therefore, a possible integer matrix is:\n\n\\[\nR_{\\text{int}} = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & -2 \\\\ 2 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's check the determinant:\n\n\\[\n\\text{det}(R_{\\text{int}}) = (-1)(-1) - (-2)(2) = 1 - 4 = -3\n\\]\n\nThe determinant does not satisfy the condition of being 1, so we need to adjust the matrix. A simple transformation to achieve a determinant of 1 is not evident with these constraints, so typically, integer solutions for rotations are more complex to derive and may not exist directly without relaxing constraints or altering the approach.\n\nIn this case, let's try a different approach by utilizing a known rotation matrix with integer entries and determinant 1, for example:\n\n\\[\nR_{\\text{final}} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThis matrix represents a 90-degree (or \\(\\pi/2\\) radians) rotation, which has a determinant of:\n\n\\[\n\\text{det}(R_{\\text{final}}) = (0)(0) - (-1)(1) = 1\n\\]\n\nGiven that finding an exact \\(2\\pi/3\\) rotation with integer entries and determinant 1 is not straightforward in typical scenarios, practitioners often rely on approximate solutions or relax one of the constraints, such as allowing non-integer entries while maintaining the determinant condition.\n\n### Python Code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the rotation angle\ntheta = 2 * np.pi / 3\n\n# Calculate the rotation matrix\nR = np.array([\n    [np.cos(theta), -np.sin(theta)],\n    [np.sin(theta), np.cos(theta)]\n])\n\n# Scale the matrix to approximate integer values\nR_scaled = np.round(R * 2)\n\n# Print results\nprint(\"Original Rotation Matrix:\")\nprint(R)\nprint(\"\\nScaled (Approximate Integer) Rotation Matrix:\")\nprint(R_scaled)\n```\n\n### Efficiency and Optimization:\n\nThe algorithm for generating rotation matrices is efficient as it involves direct computation of trigonometric functions. Optimization could involve using precomputed values for \\(\\cos\\) and \\(\\sin\\) when working with fixed angles.\n\nFinding an integer matrix with determinant 1 is a complex problem, often involving number theory and may not always be possible for arbitrary angles. In practice, sacrificing one of the constraints, like integer entries, or using techniques like lattice basis reduction (e.g., LLL algorithm) might help in specific cases."
