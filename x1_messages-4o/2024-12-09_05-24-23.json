The site runs normally and I can visit it with no issues. However, when I reload my Cloud server, I am unsure of how to stop the development server. Currently, I am forced to kill the process to stop it. Is there a more efficient way to stop the Django development server?"

        "content": "When you start the Django development server using the `manage.py runserver` command, it runs in the foreground of your terminal session. If you log out or close the terminal session, the server process will typically terminate. However, if you are using a tool like `nohup`, `screen`, or `tmux` to keep it running in the background, or if you use SSH and have a persistent session, you might encounter the situation where the server continues running even after you log out or disconnect.\n\nTo stop the Django development server more efficiently, consider the following methods:\n\n1. **Using `kill` Command:**\n   - If you know the process ID (PID) of the running server, you can stop it by executing:\n     ```\n     kill <PID>\n     ```\n   - To find the PID, you can use:\n     ```\n     ps aux | grep runserver\n     ```\n     Look for the line that corresponds to your Django server and note the PID.\n\n2. **Using `pkill` Command:**\n   - You can use `pkill` to terminate the process by name:\n     ```\n     pkill -f runserver\n     ```\n\n3. **Using `screen` or `tmux`:**\n   - If you're using `screen` or `tmux` to run your server in a detachable session, you can reattach to the session and stop the server by pressing `Ctrl + C`.\n\n4. **Using `nohup`:**\n   - If you started the server using `nohup`, you can stop it by finding the PID as described above and using the `kill` command.\n\n5. **Using Management Commands:**\n   - If you have multiple processes and want a more organized way to handle them, consider using a process manager like `supervisor`, `systemd`, or `pm2` (though `pm2` is typically for Node.js, it can be configured for any process).\n\nIn a production environment, it's recommended to use a more robust web server like Gunicorn or uWSGI behind a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache to handle requests, which provides more control and better performance than the built-in Django development server."
