        "content": "When using the Python debugger (`pdb`) in Sublime Text 3, encountering issues like the `BdbQuit` error can be frustrating. Here are some steps and tips to help you set breakpoints and debug effectively:\n\n1. **Check Python Version**: Ensure you're using a compatible Python version. It looks like you're using Python 2.7, which is outdated. Consider upgrading to Python 3.x if possible, as Python 2 has reached end-of-life.\n\n2. **Use a Custom Build System**: The default build system may not handle interactive debugging well. Create a custom build system in Sublime Text to launch your script in a terminal where `pdb` can run interactively.\n\n   - Go to `Tools` > `Build System` > `New Build System...`.\n   - Replace the content with the following template and save it as `PythonPdb.sublime-build`:\n\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"shell_cmd\": \"gnome-terminal -x python -i \\\"$file\\\"\",\n       \"file_regex\": \"^[ ]*File \\\"(...*?)\\\", line ([0-9]*)\",\n       \"selector\": \"source.python\"\n     }\n     ```\n\n   - Note: This example uses `gnome-terminal` for Linux. For Windows, you can use `cmd.exe` or another terminal emulator that supports interactive mode.\n\n3. **Using pdb.set_trace()**: Make sure the line `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` is correctly placed where you want the breakpoint. When executed, it should drop you into the interactive debugger.\n\n4. **Running in Command Line**: Instead of running directly in Sublime Text, try executing your script from the command line to see if the issue persists. This can help determine if the problem is with Sublime Text or your script.\n\n5. **SublimeREPL**: If you want to use SublimeREPL, ensure it's correctly installed and configured. However, note that SublimeREPL may not fully support interactive debugging with `pdb`.\n\n6. **Alternative Debugging Tools**: Consider using other debugging tools like `ipdb` or `pdb++`, which offer enhanced interfaces and might integrate better with your environment.\n\nBy setting up a custom build system and ensuring compatibility of tools, you should be able to debug your Python code in Sublime Text more effectively."
