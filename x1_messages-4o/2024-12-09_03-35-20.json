The focus is mainly on the inheritance relationships and to a lesser extent, compositional relationships. The source code is simple, mostly from the days of Python 1.5.2, with a few elements from 2.3. Class attributes that are just Python primitives are not of interest."

        "content": "Generating a UML class diagram from Python source code, especially with a focus on inheritance and compositional relationships, can be accomplished using several tools and methods. Given the simplicity of your source code and its vintage, you'll likely benefit from tools that can handle older Python versions and provide clear visualizations of class relationships. Here are some recommended methods:\n\n1. **Pyreverse (part of pylint):**\n   - Pyreverse is a popular tool for generating UML diagrams from Python code. It analyzes Python source files and generates class diagrams and package dependency diagrams.\n   - You can install it via pip if you have pylint installed:\n     ```bash\n     pip install pylint\n     ```\n   - To generate UML diagrams focusing on class inheritance and composition, you can run:\n     ```bash\n     pyreverse -o png -p ProjectName your_python_file.py\n     ```\n   - This will create UML class diagrams in the specified format (e.g., PNG).\n\n2. **PlantUML with Python Parsing:**\n   - PlantUML is a flexible tool that can generate UML diagrams from a textual description.\n   - You can use a Python script to parse your source code and output a PlantUML-compatible description focusing on inheritance and compositions.\n   - PlantUML diagrams can then be generated using the PlantUML tool or online services.\n\n3. **Doxygen with Graphviz:**\n   - Doxygen is a documentation generator that can produce UML class diagrams when configured with Graphviz.\n   - Write a Doxyfile to configure Doxygen to parse your Python files and enable UML diagrams.\n   - This method requires more setup but can generate comprehensive diagrams if configured correctly.\n\n4. **PyCharm or Visual Studio Code with Extensions:**\n   - Some IDEs like PyCharm offer UML diagram support through plugins or built-in tools.\n   - Extensions in Visual Studio Code can also analyze Python code and generate UML diagrams.\n\n5. **Custom Script:**\n   - For older Python versions, you might consider writing a custom Python script to parse your code. This script can analyze class definitions, inheritance, and composition relationships, then output a format suitable for a UML tool like PlantUML.\n\nWhen choosing a method, consider the complexity of your codebase, the level of automation desired, and the specific UML features you need to highlight."
