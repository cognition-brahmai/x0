For example, I have a URL \"https://www.google.dk:80/barbaz\" and I would like to replace \"www.google.dk\" with \"www.foo.dk\" to get the URL \"https://www.foo.dk:80/barbaz\". I am aware of the urlparse.urlsplit function that refers to hostname, but I am unable to make changes as the resulting type ParseResult doesn't allow me to. I am looking for a solution that doesn't involve reconstructing the new URL by appending all the parts together with \"+\", which would result in quite ugly code with many conditionals to get \"://\" and \":\" in the correct places. Is there a better way to do this?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this by using the `urlparse` module to parse the URL, modify the necessary components, and then reconstruct the URL using the `urlunparse` or `urlunsplit` functions. These functions allow you to modify components of the URL and then easily reconstruct it without manually concatenating parts. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom urllib.parse import urlsplit, urlunsplit\n\ndef change_hostname(url, new_hostname):\n    # Split the URL into components\n    parsed_url = urlsplit(url)\n    \n    # Modify the hostname\n    new_netloc = new_hostname\n    \n    # Include port if it exists\n    if parsed_url.port:\n        new_netloc += f\":{parsed_url.port}\"\n    \n    # Reconstruct the URL with the modified hostname\n    new_url = urlunsplit((\n        parsed_url.scheme,\n        new_netloc,\n        parsed_url.path,\n        parsed_url.query,\n        parsed_url.fragment\n    ))\n    \n    return new_url\n\n# Original URL\nurl = \"https://www.google.dk:80/barbaz\"\n\n# New hostname\nnew_hostname = \"www.foo.dk\"\n\n# Get the new URL\nnew_url = change_hostname(url, new_hostname)\nprint(new_url)\n```\n\nThis code first splits the URL into its components using `urlsplit`. It then modifies the `netloc` to replace the hostname while preserving the port. Finally, it reconstructs the URL using `urlunsplit`, which takes care of all the delimiters like `://` and `:`. This approach is clean and avoids manual string manipulation, making the code easier to maintain."
