The strings I'm looking for are in the form of either `AB_N` or `CDE_N`, where `AB` and `CDE` are fixed letters followed by an underscore, and `N` can be 2 or 3 numbers. I tried `(AB|CDE)_\\d{2,3}`, but it returns a group. I can't do `\\w{2,3}\\d{2,3}` because it has to be either `AB` or `CDE`, not `AC` or `FEG`. Omitting the parentheses also doesn't work. Can someone provide a solution for this issue?"

        "content": "To match the specific pattern you're looking for in your log file using Python and regex, you need to ensure that your regular expression accurately captures the desired patterns without unnecessary grouping. The pattern `(AB|CDE)_\\d{2,3}` should work correctly for matching either `AB` or `CDE` followed by an underscore and 2 to 3 digits. However, if you are having issues with grouping, it might be due to how you're using the `re` module functions.\n\nHere's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Ensure you're using the `re` module correctly.\n2. Use the `re.findall()` function to find all matches in the string without capturing unnecessary groups.\n\nHere's a sample code snippet:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Sample log data\nlog_data = \"\"\"\nAB_123\nCDE_45\nCDE_678\nAC_234\nFEG_89\nAB_9\n\"\"\"\n\n# Regular expression pattern\npattern = r'\\b(?:AB|CDE)_\\d{2,3}\\b'\n\n# Find all matches\nmatches = re.findall(pattern, log_data)\n\n# Print matches\nprint(matches)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `\\b`: Word boundary to ensure that the match occurs at a word boundary.\n- `(?:AB|CDE)`: Non-capturing group for `AB` or `CDE`.\n- `_\\d{2,3}`: Matches an underscore followed by 2 or 3 digits.\n- `\\b`: Another word boundary to ensure the pattern ends correctly.\n\nWith this setup, `re.findall()` will return all matches in the string without capturing unwanted groups. The use of `(?:...)` as a non-capturing group ensures that the grouping does not interfere with the output you desire."
