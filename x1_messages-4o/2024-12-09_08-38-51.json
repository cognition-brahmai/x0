        "content": "To determine when a download has completed using Python Selenium with the Firefox driver, you can monitor the download directory for the presence of a temporary file that Firefox creates during the download process. Once this temporary file is no longer present, you can assume that the download has completed. Here is a basic approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Set up Firefox to download files to a specific directory.**\n\n2. **Monitor the download directory for the file.**\n\nBelow is an example of how you might implement this:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport time\nfrom selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options\n\n# Set up Firefox options to download files to a specific directory\ndownload_dir = \"/path/to/download/directory\"\n\noptions = Options()\noptions.set_preference(\"browser.download.folderList\", 2)  # 2 means custom location\noptions.set_preference(\"browser.download.manager.showWhenStarting\", False)\noptions.set_preference(\"browser.download.dir\", download_dir)\noptions.set_preference(\"browser.helperApps.neverAsk.saveToDisk\", \"application/pdf\")  # Specify the MIME type\n\n# Initialize the Firefox driver with the specified options\ndriver = webdriver.Firefox(options=options)\n\n# Navigate to the desired URL or perform actions to initiate the download\ndriver.get(\"http://example.com/somefile.pdf\")\n\n# Function to wait for download to complete\ndef wait_for_download_to_complete(download_path):\n    file_exists = False\n    while not file_exists:\n        time.sleep(1)  # Wait for a second before checking again\n        # Look for files ending with '.part' which are temporary files\n        files = os.listdir(download_path)\n        file_exists = not any(file.endswith('.part') for file in files)\n\n# Call the function to wait for the download to complete\nwait_for_download_to_complete(download_dir)\n\n# Perform actions after download is complete\nprint(\"Download complete\")\n\n# Close the browser\ndriver.quit()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Download Directory**: Make sure to replace `/path/to/download/directory` with the actual path where you want the files to be downloaded.\n  \n- **MIME Type**: Adjust the MIME type in `options.set_preference(\"browser.helperApps.neverAsk.saveToDisk\", \"application/pdf\")` according to the file type you are downloading. This setting prevents the download dialog from appearing.\n\n- **Temporary Files**: Firefox creates temporary files with the `.part` extension during downloads. By checking for these files, you can determine when the download is complete.\n\nThis method should allow you to detect when a download has finished using Selenium with the Firefox driver."
