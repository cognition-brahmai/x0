The error states \"unrecognized arguments: f2.txt f3.txt\". I am using the 'nargs' parameter in the 'add_argument' method with the value '?' as I want to allow any number of files. How can I modify my code to successfully read multiple file names as arguments?\n\nHere is my command in the terminal to run the program:\n\n```python\npython program.py f1.txt f2.txt f3.txt\n```\n\nHere is my Python script:\n\n```python\nimport argparse\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()      \n    parser.add_argument('file', nargs='?', type=file)\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    for f in args.file:\n        print f\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\nIf I change 'add_argument' to `parser.add_argument('file', nargs=3)`, I can print them as strings but I can't get it to work with '?'."

        "content": "The issue you're facing arises because `'nargs'='?'` tells `argparse` to expect zero or one arguments for `'file'`, which is not suitable for handling multiple files. Instead, you should use `'nargs='*'` or `'nargs='+'` to allow multiple file names as arguments. Here's how you can modify your script to handle multiple files:\n\n1. Use `'nargs='*'` if you want to allow zero or more files.\n2. Use `'nargs='+'` if you want to require at least one file.\n\nHere's how you can modify your script:\n\n```python\nimport argparse\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\n    # Use '*' to allow zero or more files, or '+' to require at least one file\n    parser.add_argument('files', nargs='+', type=str)  # Use '+' for one or more files\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    for f in args.files:\n        print(f)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`nargs='*'`**: This will allow zero or more file names to be passed. It is flexible but can result in an empty list if no files are provided.\n- **`nargs='+'`**: This will require at least one file name. It ensures that the program receives at least one file argument, which is often more desirable for file processing.\n\n### Usage:\n\nRun the program with one or more file names:\n\n```bash\npython program.py f1.txt f2.txt f3.txt\n```\n\nThis will successfully print the names of each file passed as arguments without triggering an unrecognized arguments error."
