        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that JSON serialization does not support encoding bytes objects directly. You need to ensure that all data being serialized into JSON is either a string, number, object, array, boolean, or null. In your case, after encoding the data using Base64, you get a bytes object, which is not supported by JSON serialization.\n\nTo fix this, you can convert the bytes object to a string before attempting to serialize it with JSON. You can do this using the `decode` method on the bytes object. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport base64\nimport json\n\ndata = {}\nencoded = base64.b64encode(b'data to be encoded').decode('utf-8')  # Decode bytes to string\ndata['bytes'] = encoded\n\nprint(json.dumps(data))\n```\n\nBy using `decode('utf-8')`, you convert the Base64-encoded bytes into a UTF-8 string, which can then be serialized by JSON. This should resolve the error you're facing."
