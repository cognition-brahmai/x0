In your code, you're attempting to call `logging.INFO(\"test\")`, but `logging.INFO` is actually an integer constant that represents the logging level for informational messages. It's not a function that you can call.\n\nHere's how you can fix your code:\n\nInstead of using `logging.INFO` as a function, you should use `logging.info()` to log your message. Here's the corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    logging.basicConfig(format='[%(asctime)s] %(levelname)s::%(module)s::%(funcName)s() %(message)s', level=logging.DEBUG)\n    logging.info(\"test\")\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, `logging.info(\"test\")` is the correct way to log an informational message. You can use `logging.debug()`, `logging.warning()`, `logging.error()`, and `logging.critical()` for other levels of logging messages as needed."
