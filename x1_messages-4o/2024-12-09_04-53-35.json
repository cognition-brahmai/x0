Although these imports work fine in my IDE, they cause an ImportError when I run pytest. This is the error I'm encountering: \n\n```\nmy_package $ pytest\n\n====================== test session starts ======================\nplatform linux -- Python 3.6.4, pytest-3.5.1, py-1.5.3, pluggy-0.6.0\nrootdir: /home/user/workspace/my_package, inifile:\ncollected 0 items / 1 errors     \n\n============================ ERRORS =============================\n___ ERROR collecting tests/test_util_module/test_utils.py ___\nImportError while importing test module '/home/user/workspace/my_package/tests/test_util_module/test_utils.py'.\nHint: make sure your test modules/packages have valid Python names.\nTraceback:\ntests/test_util_module/test_utils.py:1: in &lt;module&gt;\n    from test.test_module.some_file import starify\nE   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'my_package.util_module'\n!!!!

I would like to keep the `src` part out of the import. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is a common one when using a `src` layout in a Python project. The `src` layout involves structuring your project such that your actual package code is inside a `src` directory. This often causes import issues during testing because the test runner (pytest in this case) does not automatically include the `src` directory in the Python path. Here's how you can resolve this:\n\n1. **Modify `sys.path` in `conftest.py`:**\n\n   You can add the `src` path to your Python path dynamically by modifying the `sys.path` in a `conftest.py` file. This file should be located at the root of your tests directory or any level above the test files where you want to affect the path.\n\n   ```python\n   # conftest.py\n   import sys\n   import os\n\n   sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '../src')))\n   ```\n\n   This will ensure that when pytest runs, it adds the `src` directory to the path, and your imports will work without needing to include `src` in them.\n\n2. **Use `PYTHONPATH` environment variable:**\n\n   Another approach is to set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable before running pytest. This adds the `src` directory to the path for the duration of the pytest session.\n\n   ```bash\n   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/user/workspace/my_package/src\n   pytest\n   ```\n\n   You can add this export line to your terminal session, a script, or a CI configuration file, depending on your workflow.\n\n3. **Pytest `--pyargs` Option:**\n\n   Alternatively, you can use the `--pyargs` option with pytest if your package is installed in editable mode (using `pip install -e .`). This tells pytest to use the Python import mechanism instead of relying solely on the local file system structure.\n\n4. **IDE Configuration:**\n\n   You can often configure your IDE to recognize the `src` directory as a source root. In many IDEs, there's an option to mark directories as \"source roots\" or similar, which tells the IDE to treat them as the base for imports.\n\nBy using one or a combination of these methods, you should be able to resolve the import issues and keep your imports clean without the `src` prefix."
