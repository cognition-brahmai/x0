        "content": "In Python, I am using a simple dataclass named 'Test' and defining a variable 'value' as integer in this class. However, when I create an instance of 'Test' with 'value' as a string, it does not automatically convert the string into an integer, as per the class definition. How can I force the conversion to the data type defined in the class without manually writing the __init__ method? \n\nHere is my code:\n\n```python\nimport dataclasses\n\n@dataclasses.dataclass\nclass Test:\n    value: int\n\ntest = Test('1')\nprint(type(test.value))  # Outputs: <class 'str'>\n```\n\nI want the output to be `<class 'int'>` instead. Is there an efficient way to achieve this?"

        "content": "To ensure that the `value` attribute of the `Test` class is always an integer, you can use the `__post_init__` method provided by dataclasses. This method is called automatically after the default `__init__` method and is a convenient place to enforce type conversions or perform additional initialization tasks.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired behavior:\n\n```python\nimport dataclasses\n\n@dataclasses.dataclass\nclass Test:\n    value: int\n    \n    def __post_init__(self):\n        # Convert value to integer\n        self.value = int(self.value)\n\ntest = Test('1')\nprint(type(test.value))  # Now outputs: <class 'int'>\n```\n\nIn this modified code, the `__post_init__` method is used to convert `self.value` to an integer after the instance is created. This way, regardless of the type of `value` passed during instantiation, it will be converted to an integer, meeting your requirement."
