For this, I wrote a recursive function but it seems that I am not able to iterate over 'b1.group.block_set' as it returns a 'RelatedManager' object. Can you please help me understand what I am doing wrong and how can I correct it? Here are my models and the function:\n```python\nclass Group(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    parent_group = models.ManyToManyField(\"self\", blank=True)\n    \n    def __unicode__(self):\n        return self.name\n\n\nclass Block(models.Model):\n    \n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    app = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    group = models.ForeignKey(Group)\n\n    def __unicode__(self):\n        return self.name\n\ndef get_blocks(group):\n    \n    def get_needed_blocks(group):\n        for block in group.block_set:\n            blocks.append(block)\n\n        if group.parent_group is not None:\n            get_needed_blocks(group.parent_group)\n\n    blocks = []\n    get_needed_blocks(group)\n    return blocks\n```"

        "content": "In your code, you're using `group.block_set` directly in the for loop, which is causing the issue because `group.block_set` returns a `RelatedManager` object. To iterate over the related `Block` objects, you need to call the `.all()` method on the `RelatedManager` to get a queryset that can be iterated over. Additionally, you need to handle the `parent_group` as a queryset since it's a `ManyToManyField`.\n\nHere's a revised version of your `get_blocks` function:\n\n```python\ndef get_blocks(group):\n    \n    def get_needed_blocks(group):\n        # Iterate over the blocks in the group\n        for block in group.block_set.all():\n            blocks.append(block)\n        \n        # Iterate over the parent groups if any\n        for parent_group in group.parent_group.all():\n            get_needed_blocks(parent_group)\n\n    blocks = []\n    get_needed_blocks(group)\n    return blocks\n```\n\n### Key Changes\n1. **Iterate Over `block_set`**: Use `group.block_set.all()` to retrieve all `Block` instances related to a `Group`.\n2. **Iterate Over `parent_group`**: Since `parent_group` is a `ManyToManyField`, you should iterate over `group.parent_group.all()` to get each related parent group.\n\nThis should correctly gather all blocks associated with the given group and its parent groups recursively."
