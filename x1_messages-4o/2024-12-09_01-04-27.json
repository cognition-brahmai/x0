When I try to import the ssl module in Python, I get an ImportError saying \"No module named _ssl\". I tried resolving this issue by recompiling the source and editing lines related to SSL in /Modules/Setup.dist as I couldn't figure out how to add the --with-ssl option. Despite these efforts, the problem persists. Can someone guide me on how to resolve this import error? Here is the traceback for your reference:\n\n```\n>>> import ssl\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/ssl.py\", line 60, in <module>\n   import _ssl             # if we can't import it, let the error propagate\nImportError: No module named _ssl\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering typically happens when the Python installation is missing the necessary SSL libraries. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Install Required Libraries:**\n   Make sure you have the required development libraries installed. Since you're on Ubuntu Maverick, you may need to install the following packages:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install build-essential\n   sudo apt-get install libssl-dev\n   sudo apt-get install libffi-dev\n   sudo apt-get install python-dev\n   ```\n\n2. **Reconfigure and Recompile Python:**\n   After installing the necessary libraries, you need to reconfigure and recompile Python with SSL support.\n\n   - Download the Python source code for the version you're using.\n   - Unpack the source code and navigate to the directory.\n   \n   ```bash\n   wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.x/Python-2.7.x.tgz\n   tar xvf Python-2.7.x.tgz\n   cd Python-2.7.x\n   ```\n\n   - Configure the build environment, ensuring that it finds the SSL libraries:\n\n   ```bash\n   ./configure --with-ssl\n   ```\n\n   - Compile and install Python:\n\n   ```bash\n   make\n   sudo make install\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify the Installation:**\n   Once Python is recompiled and installed, verify that the `_ssl` module can be imported without errors:\n\n   ```python\n   python -c \"import ssl; print(ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION)\"\n   ```\n\n   This command should output the version of OpenSSL, confirming that the SSL module is working correctly.\n\n4. **Check Python Path:**\n   Ensure that the Python path is correct and the newly compiled version is being used by default. You might want to check your environment variables or update your `PATH` to ensure the correct version of Python is prioritized.\n\n5. **Alternative Solution:**\n   If recompiling seems daunting or doesn't work, consider using `pyenv` to manage Python versions and easily switch between them. It can help you install Python with SSL support without manually handling the compilation process.\n\n   ```bash\n   curl https://pyenv.run | bash\n   exec $SHELL\n   pyenv install 2.7.x\n   pyenv global 2.7.x\n   ```\n\nAfter following these steps, the `_ssl` module should be properly installed and functional. If you encounter further issues, double-check the installation paths and ensure that the correct libraries are being linked during the compilation process."
