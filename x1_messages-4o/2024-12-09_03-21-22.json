I'm expecting output similar to the JSON structure provided. However, when I print the data, I get \"<bound method Response.json of <Response [200]>>\". How can I correctly print or see the JSON response from my GET request?\n\nHere's the Python code I am using:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\n\nurl = \"https://randomuser.me/api/\"\ndata = requests.get(url).json\n\nprint data\n```\n\nAnd this is the output that I'm getting:\n\n```python\n# <bound method Response.json of <Response [200]>>\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is because you're trying to print a method object instead of calling the method to retrieve the JSON data. When you use `requests.get(url).json`, you're actually accessing the `json` method of the `Response` object, not calling it. To fix this, you need to call the method by adding parentheses `()`.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\n\nurl = \"https://randomuser.me/api/\"\nresponse = requests.get(url)\n\n# Call the json() method to get the JSON response\ndata = response.json()\n\n# Print the JSON data in a pretty format\nprint(json.dumps(data, indent=4))\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, `response.json()` calls the `json` method, which parses the response content and returns it as a dictionary (or list, depending on the structure of the JSON response). \n\nUsing `json.dumps(data, indent=4)` helps to print the JSON data in a more readable, pretty-printed format."
