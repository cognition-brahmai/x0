However, when I add this pattern as \"(\\.\\w+)+\", it only captures the last match. For instance, \"yasar@webmail.something.edu.tr\" matches but only includes the \".tr\" part after \"yasar@webmail\", causing me to lose the \".something\" and \".edu\" groups. Is it possible to do this in Python regular expressions or should I match everything at first and split the subpatterns later?"

        "content": "When you're using regular expressions in Python and you want to capture multiple occurrences of a pattern, the default behavior is to only capture the last occurrence if you use the same capturing group multiple times. To capture all occurrences, you can use a non-capturing group for the repeated patterns and then use an approach to extract the parts separately.\n\nHere's a way to achieve what you want:\n\n1. Match the entire email address with the domain part.\n2. Use a regular expression to capture all parts of the domain.\n3. Split the domain part to get individual components.\n\nHere's an example code snippet:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Sample email address\nemail = \"yasar@webmail.something.edu.tr\"\n\n# Compile a regex pattern to match the full email address and capture the domain part\npattern = re.compile(r'(\\w+@\\w+)((?:\\.\\w+)+)')\nmatch = pattern.match(email)\n\nif match:\n    # Extract the username and domain part\n    username = match.group(1)\n    domain = match.group(2)\n\n    # Split the domain part into its components\n    domain_parts = domain.split('.')\n\n    print(\"Username:\", username)\n    print(\"Domain parts:\", domain_parts)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nUsername: yasar@webmail\nDomain parts: ['', 'something', 'edu', 'tr']\n```\n\nNote that the first element in `domain_parts` is an empty string because the split occurs at the initial period. You can filter this out if needed by using a list comprehension:\n\n```python\ndomain_parts = [part for part in domain_parts if part]\n```\n\nThis approach allows you to capture and process each segment of the domain separately."
