        "content": "To implement the `getDanceStyleDetails` function in Swift, we need to create a simple lookup mechanism to match the input dance style with its corresponding characteristics and notable features from the provided table. We can achieve this using a dictionary where each dance style is a key, and its value is a tuple containing the characteristics and notable features.\n\nHere's the step-by-step implementation:\n\n1. **Define a Dictionary**: We'll use a dictionary to map each dance style to its corresponding characteristics and notable features. The keys will be the dance styles, and the values will be tuples containing the characteristics and notable features.\n\n2. **Function Logic**: The function will take a dance style as input and check if it exists in the dictionary. If it does, it will return the corresponding tuple. If it doesn't, the function can return an empty tuple or handle it as an error case.\n\n3. **Swift Code**: Implement the function using the dictionary and tuple lookup.\n\nHere's the complete implementation of the function:\n\n```swift\nfunc getDanceStyleDetails(danceStyle: String) -> (characteristics: String, notableFeatures: String) {\n    // Define the dictionary containing dance styles and their details\n    let danceStyles: [String: (characteristics: String, notableFeatures: String)] = [\n        \"Contemporary Dance\": (\n            characteristics: \"A fusion of ballet, modern, and jazz styles that emphasizes versatility and improvisation.\",\n            notableFeatures: \"Use of floorwork, athletic movements, and emotional expressiveness.\"\n        ),\n        \"Hip Hop Dance\": (\n            characteristics: \"An urban dance style that originated in African American and Latino communities and is characterized by rhythmic movements and a focus on individual style.\",\n            notableFeatures: \"Breakdancing, popping and locking, and freestyle improvisation.\"\n        )\n    ]\n    \n    // Check if the dance style exists in the dictionary and return its details\n    if let details = danceStyles[danceStyle] {\n        return details\n    } else {\n        // Return a default value or handle the error case\n        return (\"Unknown Dance Style\", \"No notable features available.\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Dictionary Setup**: We defined a dictionary `danceStyles` where each key is a dance style, and each value is a tuple of characteristics and notable features.\n\n- **Function Implementation**: The function checks if the provided `danceStyle` exists in the dictionary. If it does, it returns the corresponding tuple. If not, it returns a default tuple indicating that the dance style is unknown.\n\n- **Error Handling**: The function currently returns a default message for unknown dance styles. This can be customized based on specific requirements, such as throwing an error or returning an optional tuple.\n\nThis implementation allows for easy expansion if more dance styles need to be added in the future."
