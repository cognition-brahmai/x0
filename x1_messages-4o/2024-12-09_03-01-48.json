I am currently trying to use `request.POST.getlist('ukeys')` but it is returning the ukeys values as `u'[]'`. When I check with `request.POST`, I get the values as `u\"<QueryDict: {u'ukeys[]': [u'68c04', u'16149']}>\"` instead.\n\n```python\ndef portfolio_add(request):\n    ukeys = request.POST.getlist('ukeys')\n    ........etc.......\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering stems from the way the keys are being sent in the POST request. When you see something like `u'ukeys[]'` in your `QueryDict`, it indicates that the keys are being sent with a suffix `[]`, which is common when using form elements like checkboxes or multi-selects in HTML.\n\nTo correctly extract these values as a list, you need to adjust the way you access the keys in your `QueryDict`. Specifically, you should use the name of the key as it appears in the `QueryDict`, which includes the `[]` suffix.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to correctly extract the values:\n\n```python\ndef portfolio_add(request):\n    # Use the key 'ukeys[]' to extract the list of values\n    ukeys = request.POST.getlist('ukeys[]')\n    # Now ukeys should contain the list [u'68c04', u'16149']\n    ........etc.......\n```\n\nBy using `request.POST.getlist('ukeys[]')`, you should be able to retrieve the list of values as expected. This approach aligns with the way the data is structured in your `QueryDict`."
