This task requires you to not only identify the key phrases but also perform multiple-step reasoning to identify their associated adjectives and verbs. You must utilize the Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging function in Python's Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library to accurately identify and extract these linguistic components. The plot summary provided below features paleontologists Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), and a group of prehistoric DNA-created dinosaurs living on an island theme park. However, as ferocious predators break free and begin hunting their prey, the team soon realizes that the park is not as safe as Hammond initially claimed."

        "content": "To achieve the task of extracting adjectives and verbs associated with key phrases from the plot summary of \"Jurassic Park,\" we can utilize the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library in Python. We'll proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. Tokenize the text into sentences and words.\n2. Perform Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging to identify adjectives and verbs.\n3. Define key phrases and extract adjectives and verbs associated with them.\n\nLet's start by writing the Python code to accomplish this:\n\n```python\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk import pos_tag\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize\nfrom nltk.chunk import ne_chunk\nfrom nltk.tree import Tree\n\n# Download necessary NLTK data (only need to do this once)\nnltk.download('punkt')\nnltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')\nnltk.download('maxent_ne_chunker')\nnltk.download('words')\n\n# The plot summary\nplot_summary = \"\"\"\nPaleontologists Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), \nbillionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), and a group of prehistoric DNA-created dinosaurs living on an island theme park. \nHowever, as ferocious predators break free and begin hunting their prey, the team soon realizes that the park is not as safe \nas Hammond initially claimed.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Tokenize the text into sentences\nsentences = sent_tokenize(plot_summary)\n\n# Define key phrases to extract adjectives and verbs for\nkey_phrases = [\"Alan Grant\", \"Ellie Sattler\", \"Ian Malcolm\", \"John Hammond\", \"dinosaurs\", \"park\", \"predators\", \"team\"]\n\n# Function to extract adjectives and verbs related to key phrases\ndef extract_adjectives_and_verbs(sentences, key_phrases):\n    results = {phrase: {'adjectives': set(), 'verbs': set()} for phrase in key_phrases}\n    \n    for sentence in sentences:\n        words = word_tokenize(sentence)\n        pos_tags = pos_tag(words)\n        \n        # Chunking named entities\n        named_entities = ne_chunk(pos_tags)\n        \n        for i, (word, tag) in enumerate(pos_tags):\n            for phrase in key_phrases:\n                if phrase in sentence:\n                    if tag.startswith('JJ'):  # Adjective\n                        results[phrase]['adjectives'].add(word)\n                    elif tag.startswith('VB'):  # Verb\n                        results[phrase]['verbs'].add(word)\n    \n    return results\n\n# Extract adjectives and verbs\nadjectives_and_verbs = extract_adjectives_and_verbs(sentences, key_phrases)\n\n# Print the results\nfor phrase, components in adjectives_and_verbs.items():\n    print(f\"Key Phrase: {phrase}\")\n    print(f\"  Adjectives: {', '.join(components['adjectives'])}\")\n    print(f\"  Verbs: {', '.join(components['verbs'])}\\n\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Tokenization**: We tokenize the plot summary into sentences and words.\n2. **POS Tagging**: We use NLTK's `pos_tag` to assign POS tags to each word.\n3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: We perform a simple named entity recognition to chunk named entities, although it's not strictly necessary for this task.\n4. **Extracting Adjectives and Verbs**: For each sentence, we check if it contains any of the key phrases. If it does, we extract adjectives (`JJ`) and verbs (`VB`) associated with those phrases.\n5. **Output**: Finally, we print the adjectives and verbs associated with each key phrase.\n\nThis code provides a basic framework for extracting linguistic components associated with specific phrases and can be further expanded or refined for more complex tasks."
