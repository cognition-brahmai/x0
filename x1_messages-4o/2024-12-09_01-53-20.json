I expect the result to look like this:\n\n```python\n[datetime.date(2014, 1, 1), datetime.date(2014, 1, 2), \n datetime.date(2014, 1, 3), ..., datetime.date(2014, 1, 29),\n datetime.date(2014, 1, 30), datetime.date(2014, 1, 31)]\n```\nI haven't been able to accomplish this yet and would appreciate any advice or suggestions on how to proceed."

        "content": "To generate a list of `datetime.date` objects for each day in the current month, you can follow these steps using Python's `datetime` and `calendar` modules. Here's a sample code that achieves this:\n\n```python\nimport datetime\nimport calendar\n\ndef get_days_in_current_month():\n    # Get today's date\n    today = datetime.date.today()\n    \n    # Extract the current year and month\n    year = today.year\n    month = today.month\n    \n    # Get the number of days in the current month\n    num_days = calendar.monthrange(year, month)[1]\n    \n    # Generate a list of datetime.date objects for each day in the month\n    days_in_month = [datetime.date(year, month, day) for day in range(1, num_days + 1)]\n    \n    return days_in_month\n\n# Example usage\ndays_list = get_days_in_current_month()\nfor day in days_list:\n    print(day)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Get Today's Date:** Use `datetime.date.today()` to get the current date.\n2. **Extract Year and Month:** Extract the current year and month from today's date.\n3. **Number of Days in Month:** Use `calendar.monthrange(year, month)` to get the number of days in the current month. The function returns a tuple where the second value is the number of days.\n4. **Generate List:** Use a list comprehension to create a list of `datetime.date` objects for each day in the current month.\n\nThis code will generate a list of date objects for each day in the current month, similar to the format you provided."
