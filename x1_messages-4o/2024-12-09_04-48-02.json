However, when I use the Pyzo IEP IDE with the same interpreter on the same code, the plot shows as expected. This leads me to believe that there may be an issue with some settings on Pycharm. I've tried using both python.exe and pythonw.exe as interpreter but both resulted in the same outcome.\n\nHere is my system information:\n\n```python\nC:\\pyzo2014a\\pythonw.exe -u C:\\Program Files (x86)\\JetBrains\\PyCharm Community Edition 3.4.1\\helpers\\pydev\\pydevconsole.py 57315 57316\nPyDev console: using IPython 2.1.0import sys; print('Python %s on %s' % (sys.version, sys.platform))\nPython 3.4.1 |Continuum Analytics, Inc.| (default, May 19 2014, 13:02:30) [MSC v.1600 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32\nsys.path.extend(['C:\\\\Users\\\\Rasmus\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\untitled2'])\nIn[3]: import IPython\nprint(IPython.sys_info())\n{'commit_hash': '681fd77',\n 'commit_source': 'installation',\n 'default_encoding': 'UTF-8',\n 'ipython_path': 'C:\\\\pyzo2014a\\\\lib\\\\site-packages\\\\IPython',\n 'ipython_version': '2.1.0',\n 'os_name': 'nt',\n 'platform': 'Windows-8-6.2.9200',\n 'sys_executable': 'C:\\\\pyzo2014a\\\\pythonw.exe',\n 'sys_platform': 'win32',\n 'sys_version': '3.4.1 |Continuum Analytics, Inc.| (default, May 19 2014, '\n                '13:02:30) [MSC v.1600 64 bit (AMD64)]'}\n```\n\nCan someone help me figure out why Pycharm is not showing the plot?"

        "content": "It looks like you are experiencing an issue with PyCharm's configuration for displaying plots. The behavior you're seeing is likely due to the way matplotlib is interacting with the PyCharm console. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Update Matplotlib Import:**\n   Ensure that you import `matplotlib.pyplot` correctly. Your import should look like this:\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n   ```\n\n2. **Interactive Mode:**\n   Enable interactive mode in matplotlib by adding `plt.ion()` at the beginning of your script. This can help keep the plot window open:\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n   plt.ion()\n   ```\n\n3. **Show Plot Explicitly:**\n   After plotting, explicitly call `plt.show()` to display the plot:\n   ```python\n   ts.plot()\n   plt.show()\n   ```\n\n4. **Check PyCharm Settings:**\n   Ensure that the PyCharm is configured to use a compatible scientific mode:\n   - Go to `File > Settings` (or `PyCharm > Preferences` on macOS).\n   - Under `Build, Execution, Deployment`, go to `Console` and ensure that the `Scientific Mode` is enabled. This helps with plots and data visualization within PyCharm.\n\n5. **Backend Configuration:**\n   Sometimes, specifying a different backend can solve display issues. You can do this by setting the matplotlib backend at the start of your script:\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib\n   matplotlib.use('TkAgg')  # You can try 'Qt5Agg', 'Agg', 'WXAgg', etc.\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n   ```\n\n6. **Update PyCharm:**\n   Make sure that you are using the latest version of PyCharm, as updates often fix bugs related to the IDE's operation.\n\n7. **Virtual Environment:**\n   Ensure that you are using the correct Python interpreter and virtual environment that has all necessary packages installed.\n\nTry these steps, and the plot should display correctly in PyCharm. Let me know if you run into any more issues!"
