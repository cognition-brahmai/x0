        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to the way Python's `distutils` library handles installation paths. When installing packages with pip, using both `--home` and `--prefix/exec-prefix` options can cause conflicts, resulting in the `DistutilsOptionError`. However, when specifying the `--target` option, you should not typically encounter this issue. Let's troubleshoot and resolve this step by step:\n\n1. **Ensure pip is up-to-date**: Sometimes, older versions of pip may have bugs or issues that can cause unexpected errors. You can update pip by running:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade pip\n   ```\n\n2. **Use a virtual environment**: It's a good practice to use virtual environments to avoid conflicts between package versions and dependencies. You can create and activate a virtual environment using:\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\\Scripts\\activate`\n   ```\n\n3. **Re-run the pip install command**: Within the virtual environment, try running the pip install command again with the `--target` option:\n   ```bash\n   pip install flask-restful --target ./lib\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for conflicting environment variables**: Make sure that there are no environment variables like `PYTHONHOME` or `PYTHONPATH` set that could interfere with installations. You can check and unset these variables if necessary:\n   ```bash\n   unset PYTHONHOME\n   unset PYTHONPATH\n   ```\n\n5. **Specify a different installation method**: If the issue persists, you can try using `--prefix` instead of `--target`, which can sometimes bypass this error:\n   ```bash\n   pip install flask-restful --prefix ./lib\n   ```\n\n6. **Inspect Setup.py**: If the package provides its own `setup.py`, sometimes editing this file to adjust installation options can help. Look for any lines that might be setting conflicting options and modify them as needed.\n\n7. **Error logs**: If the error continues, check the detailed error logs that pip might provide. There might be additional clues as to why the installation is failing.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to install the package into a custom target directory without encountering the `DistutilsOptionError`. If the issue still persists, there might be an underlying bug or environment configuration issue that needs more specific investigation."
