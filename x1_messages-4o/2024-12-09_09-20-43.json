        "content": "Certainly! To create a program that prints the frequency of all elements in an array, you can use a simple approach that involves iterating through the array and counting the occurrences of each element. Here, I'll provide a solution using Python, which is a popular and easy-to-understand programming language.\n\nHere's a Python program to achieve that:\n\n```python\ndef print_frequency(arr):\n    # Create an empty dictionary to store frequencies\n    frequency_dict = {}\n\n    # Iterate through each element in the array\n    for element in arr:\n        # If the element is already in the dictionary, increment its count\n        if element in frequency_dict:\n            frequency_dict[element] += 1\n        # If the element is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1\n        else:\n            frequency_dict[element] = 1\n\n    # Print the frequency of each element\n    for element, frequency in frequency_dict.items():\n        print(f\"Element: {element}, Frequency: {frequency}\")\n\n# Example usage\narray = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5]\nprint_frequency(array)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Dictionary for Frequency Count**: We use a dictionary `frequency_dict` to keep track of the frequency of each element. The dictionary keys are the elements of the array, and the values are their respective counts.\n\n2. **Iterating through the Array**: We loop through each element in the array. For each element, we check if it's already in the dictionary:\n   - If it is, we increment its count.\n   - If it isn't, we add it to the dictionary with an initial count of 1.\n\n3. **Printing the Results**: After populating the dictionary with frequencies, we iterate through the dictionary items and print the element along with its frequency.\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the frequency of each element in the array with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array."
