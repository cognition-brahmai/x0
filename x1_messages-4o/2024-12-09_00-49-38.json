        "content": "The error you are encountering might be due to a few different reasons. It is possible that there have been changes or deprecations in the Keras library, but it's also possible that there is an issue with your local environment or the specific version of Keras you are using. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Keras and TensorFlow Version**: \n   - Ensure that you are using the correct versions of Keras and TensorFlow. Keras is now part of TensorFlow, and the standalone `keras` package might not be the most up-to-date. You can check your versions using:\n     ```python\n     import tensorflow as tf\n     print(tf.__version__)\n     ```\n\n2. **Use TensorFlow's Keras**:\n   - Since Keras is integrated into TensorFlow, you should try importing `to_categorical` from `tensorflow.keras` instead of `keras`. Use the following import statement:\n     ```python\n     from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical\n     ```\n\n3. **Reinstall Keras and TensorFlow**:\n   - If the problem persists, try reinstalling Keras and TensorFlow to ensure that all packages and dependencies are correctly installed. You can do this using pip:\n     ```bash\n     pip uninstall keras tensorflow\n     pip install tensorflow\n     ```\n\n4. **Check for Updates**:\n   - Sometimes, issues like these are resolved in subsequent updates. Make sure to update your Python packages regularly.\n\n5. **Consult the Documentation**:\n   - The official TensorFlow and Keras documentation might have updates regarding changes in the library. Check the documentation for the latest guidance on using `to_categorical`.\n\n6. **Virtual Environment**:\n   - If you are working in a shared environment, there might be conflicts with other installed packages. Consider setting up a virtual environment and installing only the packages you need.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the ImportError and continue using the `to_categorical` function."
