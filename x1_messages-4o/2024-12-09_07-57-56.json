For instance, I have two numpy arrays `foo = np.array( [ 1, 2, 3 ] )` and `bar = np.array( [ 4, 5, 6 ] )` which I want to combine into a Pandas DataFrame. If I use `pd.DataFrame( { 'foo': pd.Series(foo), 'bar': pd.Series(bar) } )`, the 'bar' column comes first because a dictionary doesn't preserve order. I can specify the order of columns, but it becomes tedious when I need to deal with many variables. Is there a way to specify the variables to be joined and to organize the column order in one operation, without having to specify the variables to be joined multiple times? If I want to add or remove one of the variables to be joined, I only want to add/remove in one place."

        "content": "To create a DataFrame from multiple numpy arrays, Pandas Series, or existing DataFrames while preserving the order of columns, you can use the `collections.OrderedDict` from Python's standard library. This will help maintain the order of the columns as you define them. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\n\n# Define your numpy arrays\nfoo = np.array([1, 2, 3])\nbar = np.array([4, 5, 6])\n\n# Use OrderedDict to maintain the order of columns\ndata = OrderedDict([\n    ('foo', foo),\n    ('bar', bar)\n])\n\n# Create a DataFrame using the OrderedDict\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nIn this approach, you only need to specify the arrays or series once in the `OrderedDict`, and the order in which you list them will be preserved in the resulting DataFrame. This makes it easy to add or remove variables from the DataFrame by simply modifying the `OrderedDict`.\n\nIf you have more variables or need to combine Series or DataFrames, you can follow the same pattern by adding them to the `OrderedDict`, ensuring that the order of keys in `OrderedDict` reflects the desired column order in the DataFrame."
