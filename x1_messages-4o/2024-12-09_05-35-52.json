I have tried utilizing strace, however, it appears to report all packages, even those not used in the application. Additionally, Python ModuleFinder only returns modules within Python2.7 and not system level packages. Is there a method for acquiring all libraries linked by my application?"

        "content": "To identify all libraries linked by your Python GUI application and verify license compatibility, you can try the following approaches:\n\n1. **Dependency Walker (Windows only):** If you're developing on Windows, you can use Dependency Walker to find all DLLs that your application is linked to. This tool analyzes executables and provides a detailed report of all the modules and libraries used.\n\n2. **ldd (Linux only):** On Linux systems, you can use the `ldd` command to list dynamic dependencies of your application. This command is typically used on compiled binaries, but you can use it on the Python interpreter or any compiled extensions you are using within your application.\n\n3. **pipdeptree:** This Python tool provides a comprehensive dependency tree of the Python packages installed in your environment. It won't catch system-level libraries, but it's useful for verifying Python package dependencies.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pipdeptree\n   pipdeptree\n   ```\n\n4. **auditwheel (Linux only):** For Linux users, `auditwheel` can be used to show external shared libraries required by Python wheels. This can be helpful if you're packaging your application in a wheel format.\n\n5. **py2exe/py2app/pyinstaller:**\n   - **PyInstaller:** If you're using PyInstaller to package your application, you can use the `--log-level` option to generate detailed logs about dependencies. This will help you see what libraries are being bundled.\n   - **py2exe/py2app:** Similar to PyInstaller, these tools can help you with bundling your application and checking dependencies.\n\n6. **Custom Script:** You can write a custom script to programmatically list all imported modules in your application. Use `pkgutil.iter_modules()` and `importlib.util.find_spec()` to detect imports and their locations.\n\n7. **Manual Review:** As a last resort, manually review your code and any third-party libraries for import statements, and check their documentation for dependencies.\n\nEach method has its strengths and limitations, so you might need to use a combination of them to get a complete picture of all the libraries your application is linked to. Once you've identified all dependencies, you can then verify their licenses for compatibility with your project's requirements."
