While most of the time it functions perfectly, I encounter issues when using a formula with \\text. For example, when I run the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nplt.plot([1,2,3])\nplt.title(r\"$f_{\\text{cor, r}}$\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\nI get the following error message:\n\n```python\nIPython/core/formatters.py:239: FormatterWarning: Exception in image/png formatter: \nf_{\\text{1cor, r}}\n   ^\nUnknown symbol: \\text (at char 3), (line:1, col:4)\n  FormatterWarning,\n```\n\nHow can I use \\text effectively in this context?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the default LaTeX interpreter used by Matplotlib does not support the `\\text` command. To use `\\text` within a LaTeX string in Matplotlib, you need to enable the use of the full LaTeX engine instead of the default mathtext renderer. Here's how you can do this:\n\n1. Ensure you have LaTeX installed on your system along with the necessary packages (`amsmath`, `amssymb`, etc.).\n\n2. Configure Matplotlib to use LaTeX for text rendering by setting the `text.usetex` parameter to `True`.\n\nHere's the modified code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Enable LaTeX rendering\nplt.rc('text', usetex=True)\nplt.rc('font', family='serif')\n\nplt.plot([1, 2, 3])\nplt.title(r\"$f_{\\text{cor, r}}$\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\nBy enabling `usetex`, Matplotlib will use the LaTeX engine to process text strings, allowing you to use the `\\text` command and other LaTeX features.\n\n**Note:** Ensure that you have a working LaTeX distribution installed on your system, such as TeX Live or MiKTeX, for this to work. If you encounter any issues with missing LaTeX packages, you may need to install them using your LaTeX package manager."
