        "content": "Certainly! Let's choose a fascinating marine animal: the **Blue Whale**.\n\n### Scientific Name:\n- **Balaenoptera musculus**\n\n### Evolutionary Lineage:\n- The Blue Whale belongs to the family **Balaenopteridae**, which is part of the order **Cetacea**. Cetaceans are divided into two suborders: Mysticeti (baleen whales) and Odontoceti (toothed whales). Blue whales are part of the Mysticeti suborder, which dates back to about 30 million years ago. This lineage includes other large baleen whales like humpback whales and fin whales.\n\n### Unique Adaptations for Survival:\n- **Size and Blubber**: Blue whales are the largest animals ever known to have lived on Earth. Their enormous size and thick blubber provide insulation in cold ocean waters.\n- **Baleen Plates**: Instead of teeth, blue whales have baleen plates that enable them to filter feed. They consume large quantities of krill by taking in vast amounts of water and then pushing it out through the baleen, trapping the krill inside.\n- **Efficient Oxygen Use**: Blue whales have adapted to make efficient use of oxygen, allowing them to dive for up to 90 minutes, although typical dives last around 10 to 20 minutes.\n- **Communication**: They produce loud, low-frequency sounds that can travel long distances underwater, which is crucial for communication and navigation in the vast ocean.\n\n### Preferred Habitat:\n- Blue whales are found in all the world's oceans except the Arctic. They prefer cold or temperate waters and often migrate between feeding grounds in polar waters and breeding grounds in warmer, tropical waters. They are typically found in areas with high concentrations of krill, their primary food source.\n\n### Note on API Usage:\nThe Go code you provided is attempting to fetch data from a placeholder API endpoint (`https://api.ocearch.org/profile/blue-whale/`). However, this endpoint might not exist or provide the required data. You would typically need to find a real API or data source that provides such information about marine animals."
