        "content": "The error message \"gcc: error trying to exec 'cc1plus': execvp: No such file or directory\" typically indicates that the C++ compiler is not installed on your system. The `cc1plus` program is part of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and is specifically used for compiling C++ code. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Install the C++ Compiler:**\n   You need to install the `g++` package, which provides the C++ compiler. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install g++\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify the Installation:**\n   After installing `g++`, you can verify that it is installed correctly by checking its version:\n\n   ```bash\n   g++ --version\n   ```\n\n   This should display the version of the installed `g++` compiler.\n\n3. **Re-attempt the Installation:**\n   Once the C++ compiler is installed, try installing the `swigibpy` module again. You can do this using `pip`:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install swigibpy\n   ```\n\nIf you continue to face issues, make sure that all necessary build tools are installed. You might want to install the `build-essential` package, which includes a collection of essential tools for building software:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n```\n\nThis package includes `g++` along with other important tools such as `make`. After installing `build-essential`, try installing your Python module again."
