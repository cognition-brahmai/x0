        "content": "Certainly! Let's break down the given C++ code step by step to understand how it calculates the sum of elements in an array:\n\n```cpp\n#include<iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n   int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n   int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);\n   int sum = 0;\n   for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n      sum += arr[i];\n   }\n   cout << \"Sum of array elements is: \" << sum << endl;\n   return 0;\n}\n```\n\n1. **Including Libraries:** The code begins by including the iostream library, which is necessary for input and output operations in C++.\n\n2. **Using Namespace:** `using namespace std;` is used to avoid prefixing `std::` before standard library functions and objects like `cout`.\n\n3. **Array Declaration and Initialization:**\n   ```cpp\n   int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n   ```\n   Here, an array named `arr` of type `int` is declared and initialized with five elements: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n4. **Calculating the Number of Elements:**\n   ```cpp\n   int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);\n   ```\n   - `sizeof(arr)` gives the total size in bytes of the array `arr`.\n   - `sizeof(arr[0])` gives the size in bytes of a single element of the array (here, an `int`).\n   - Dividing the total size of the array by the size of one element gives the number of elements (`n`) in the array.\n\n5. **Initializing Sum Variable:**\n   ```cpp\n   int sum = 0;\n   ```\n   A variable `sum` is initialized to 0 to store the cumulative sum of the array elements.\n\n6. **Iterating Over the Array:**\n   ```cpp\n   for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n      sum += arr[i];\n   }\n   ```\n   - A `for` loop is used to iterate over each element of the array.\n   - In each iteration, the current element `arr[i]` is added to the `sum`.\n\n7. **Output the Result:**\n   ```cpp\n   cout << \"Sum of array elements is: \" << sum << endl;\n   ```\n   - The final value of `sum`, which represents the total sum of all the array elements, is printed to the console.\n\n8. **Return Statement:**\n   ```cpp\n   return 0;\n   ```\n   The program returns 0, indicating that it executed successfully.\n\nIn summary, this code calculates the sum of the elements in the array by initializing a sum variable to 0, iterating through each element of the array, adding each element to the sum, and finally printing the result. The output for this specific array would be `Sum of array elements is: 15`."
