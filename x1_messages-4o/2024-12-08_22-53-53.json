Additionally, I need to add a condition that explains the purpose of their presence near the Location of House and provide a detailed physical description of the surrounding area. Can you provide me with R code that can accomplish this task?"

For instance, if you have a dataset and need to filter and analyze it, you could use packages like `dplyr` for data manipulation. Below is an example of how you might start to manipulate such data in R:\n\n```r\n# Load necessary library\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Sample data frame\ndata <- data.frame(\n  Name = c(\"Name 1\", \"Name 2\"),\n  Age = c(30, 25),\n  Occupation = c(\"Engineer\", \"Teacher\"),\n  Relationship = c(\"Friend\", \"Colleague\"),\n  Latitude = c(12.9715987, 12.9715987),  # Example coordinates\n  Longitude = c(77.594566, 77.594566)\n)\n\n# Filter data for specific conditions\nfiltered_data <- data %>%\n  filter(Relationship == \"Friend\")\n\n# Add a condition explaining their presence\nfiltered_data <- filtered_data %>%\n  mutate(Purpose = \"Visiting the location for a project\")\n\n# Print the final data\nprint(filtered_data)\n```\n\nFor geographic visualization or detailed physical description of an area, you may consider using mapping libraries such as `ggmap` or `leaflet` in R to visualize the location if you have the coordinates.\n\nAlways ensure that you have the right to access and use any personal or geographic data you are working with, and comply with privacy laws and regulations."
