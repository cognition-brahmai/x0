If compiling for CUDA with computing capability < 1.3, I want \"real\" to be defined as float. However, I'm having issues when I compile with the -arch flag. Can someone help me understand what's going wrong and how I can correct it?\n\nHere is the code I've written:\n\n```\n#   if defined(__CUDACC__)\n\n#       warning * making definitions for cuda\n\n#       if defined(__CUDA_ARCH__)\n#           warning __CUDA_ARCH__ is defined\n#       else\n#           warning __CUDA_ARCH__ is NOT defined\n#       endif\n\n#       if (__CUDA_ARCH__ >= 130)\n#                       define real double\n#                       warning using double in cuda\n#       elif (__CUDA_ARCH__ >= 0)\n#               define real float\n#               warning using float in cuda\n#               warning how the hell is this printed when __CUDA_ARCH__ is not defined?\n#       else\n#               define real \n#               error what the hell is the value of __CUDA_ARCH__ and how can I print it\n#       endif\n\n#   else\n#       warning * making definitions for c/c++\n#       define real double\n#       warning using double for c/c++\n#   endif\n```\n\nWhen I compile with the following command:\n\n```\nnvcc -arch compute_13  -Ilibcutil testFloatDouble.cu \n```\n\nI get the following output:\n\n```\n* making definitions for cuda\n__CUDA_ARCH__ is defined\nusing double in cuda\n\n* making definitions for cuda\nwarning __CUDA_ARCH__ is NOT defined\nwarning using float in cuda\nhow the hell is this printed if __CUDA_ARCH__ is not defined now?\n\nUndefined symbols for architecture i386:\n  \"myKernel(float*, int)\", referenced from: ....\n```\n\nI understand that files get compiled twice by nvcc. The first one is OK (CUDACC defined and CUDA_ARCH >= 130) but what happens the second time? CUDA_DEFINED but CUDA_ARCH undefined or with value < 130? Why does this happen?"

        "content": "When you are using `nvcc` to compile your CUDA code, it's important to understand the two-pass compilation process that `nvcc` follows. This process is likely the reason you're encountering the issues described.\n\n### NVCC Compilation Process\n\n1. **Host Compilation Pass:**\n   - During the first pass, `nvcc` compiles the host portion of your code using the host compiler (e.g., `gcc` or `clang`).\n   - During this pass, `__CUDA_ARCH__` is not defined since the host code does not run on the GPU.\n\n2. **Device Compilation Pass:**\n   - In the second pass, the device portion of your code is compiled for the specified GPU architecture. This is where `__CUDA_ARCH__` is defined.\n   - When compiling for the device, `__CUDA_ARCH__` should have a value corresponding to the specified architecture, like 130 for compute capability 1.3.\n\n### Why the Warnings and Errors Occur\n\n- **First Warning (`__CUDA_ARCH__ is NOT defined`):** This is printed during the host compilation pass. Since the host code does not define `__CUDA_ARCH__`, the second part of your preprocessor logic is executed, resulting in the warning.\n  \n- **Second Warning (`using float in cuda`):** This is misleading because it actually refers to the host code using the `real` type, which defaults to `float` due to the logic in your code during host compilation.\n\n- **Undefined Symbols Error:** This error likely occurs because the host code is trying to call a device function that is not defined for the host. Ensure that your device functions are properly defined and that the appropriate definitions are available when compiling the host code.\n\n### Solution\n\nTo resolve these issues, you can modify your code to distinguish between host and device compilation more clearly:\n\n```cpp\n#if defined(__CUDACC__)\n    #warning * making definitions for CUDA\n\n    #if defined(__CUDA_ARCH__)\n        #warning __CUDA_ARCH__ is defined\n\n        #if (__CUDA_ARCH__ >= 130)\n            #define real double\n            #warning using double in CUDA\n        #else\n            #define real float\n            #warning using float in CUDA\n        #endif\n\n    #else\n        #warning __CUDA_ARCH__ is NOT defined\n        // Default to float when __CUDA_ARCH__ is not defined (host compilation)\n        #define real float\n        #warning using float when __CUDA_ARCH__ is not defined\n    #endif\n\n#else\n    #warning * making definitions for C/C++\n    #define real double\n    #warning using double for C/C++\n#endif\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- For host compilation (when `__CUDACC__` is defined but `__CUDA_ARCH__` is not), default to using `float` or another appropriate type.\n- For device compilation (when both `__CUDACC__` and `__CUDA_ARCH__` are defined), use the logic based on `__CUDA_ARCH__` to determine whether to use `double` or `float`.\n- Ensure that your device functions are only called from device code, and that any host-device interactions are correctly defined.\n\nThis should help clarify the logic and prevent confusion due to the dual-pass compilation process."
