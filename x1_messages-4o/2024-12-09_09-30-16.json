        "content": "To convert a binary tree to its equivalent linked list, you can perform a tree traversal and adjust the pointers to create a linked list. One common approach is to use an in-order, pre-order, or post-order traversal to achieve this. Here, I'll explain how to convert a binary tree to a singly linked list using the pre-order traversal method, where the linked list will follow the same order as the traversal.\n\nHere's a step-by-step algorithm to achieve this:\n\n1. **Initialize Necessary Pointers**: \n   - Create a `prev` pointer to keep track of the previously processed node in the linked list, initialized to `None`.\n   - Create a `head` pointer to point to the head of the linked list, initialized to `None`.\n\n2. **Recursive Function**: \n   - Define a recursive function `flatten` that takes the root of the binary tree as its argument.\n\n3. **Base Case**:\n   - If the root is `None`, return from the function as there's nothing to process.\n\n4. **Pre-order Traversal**:\n   - Process the current node.\n     - If `prev` is not `None`, set `prev.right` to the current node (assuming the linked list is formed using the right pointers of the tree nodes).\n     - If `head` is `None`, set `head` to the current node (this will execute only once for the actual head node of the linked list).\n     - Set `prev` to the current node.\n   - Recursively call the `flatten` function on the left child of the current node.\n   - Recursively call the `flatten` function on the right child of the current node.\n\n5. **Adjust Left Pointers**:\n   - As you process each node, set its left pointer to `None` to ensure it behaves like a singly linked list.\n\n6. **Return the Linked List**:\n   - After the traversal is complete, the `head` pointer will point to the head of the linked list.\n\nHere's a simple implementation in Python:\n\n```python\nclass TreeNode:\n    def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None):\n        self.value = value\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n\nclass Solution:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.prev = None\n        self.head = None\n\n    def flatten(self, root):\n        if not root:\n            return\n        \n        # Pre-order traversal: process the current node\n        if self.prev:\n            self.prev.right = root\n        else:\n            self.head = root\n        \n        self.prev = root\n        left = root.left  # Store left child\n        right = root.right  # Store right child\n\n        # Set the left child to None (for singly linked list)\n        root.left = None\n        \n        # Recursively flatten the left subtree\n        self.flatten(left)\n        \n        # Recursively flatten the right subtree\n        self.flatten(right)\n\n# Usage\nbinary_tree_root = TreeNode(1, TreeNode(2), TreeNode(5))\nsolution = Solution()\nsolution.flatten(binary_tree_root)\nlinked_list_head = solution.head\n```\n\nThis code will convert the binary tree into a singly linked list where each node points to the next in a pre-order traversal manner. Adjust the traversal order or node connections as needed for your specific requirements."
