I am aware that in bash, we can read a password without re-displaying it on the screen using the command 'read -s'. Is there a similar command or function in Python to achieve this? For example, something like the following:\n\n```python\npassword = raw_input('Password: ', dont_print_statement_back_to_screen)\n```\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to replace the typed characters with '*' before sending them back to the screen, similar to the browser style?"

        "content": "Yes, in Python, you can read a password from the command line without displaying it on the screen using the `getpass` module. The `getpass.getpass()` function is designed for this purpose. Here's a simple example:\n\n```python\nimport getpass\n\npassword = getpass.getpass('Password: ')\nprint('You entered:', '*' * len(password))\n```\n\nThis will prompt the user for a password and not display what is typed on the screen. The password is stored in the variable `password`, and you can replace the typed characters with '*' when displaying it as shown in the print statement.\n\nIf you want to display '*' for each character typed (similar to how many web forms work), you would need a more customized approach, possibly using libraries like `curses`, which are more complex and are designed for creating text-based user interfaces. However, for simple command-line password input, `getpass` is the most straightforward and widely used method in Python."
