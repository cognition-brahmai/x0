Currently, I have a complex command that I've simplified into a shell/bash script using '$1'. Here is my current script:\n\n```bash\nfoo $1 args -o $1.ext\n```\n\nI want to be able to pass multiple input names to this script. What would be the correct method to accomplish this?"

        "content": "To modify your Bash script to iterate over multiple arguments while properly handling filenames with spaces, you can use a `for` loop to iterate over each argument. By enclosing `$@` in double quotes, you ensure that each argument, even those with spaces, is treated as a single entity. Here is how you can modify your script:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor arg in \"$@\"; do\n  foo \"$arg\" args -o \"$arg.ext\"\ndone\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- `\"$@\"`: This represents all the arguments passed to the script, with each argument treated as a separate word. By enclosing it in quotes, you ensure that filenames with spaces are handled correctly.\n\n- `for arg in \"$@\"; do ... done`: This loop iterates through each argument passed to the script. Inside the loop, each argument is referred to as `$arg`.\n\n- `foo \"$arg\" args -o \"$arg.ext\"`: This is the command executed for each argument. The argument is properly quoted to handle any spaces in filenames.\n\n### Usage:\n\nTo use this script, simply pass the filenames as arguments when you run the script. For example:\n\n```bash\n./yourscript.sh \"file one\" \"file two\" \"file three\"\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that each filename is handled correctly, even if it contains spaces."
