        "content": "How can I read a file byte by byte in Python? Additionally, how can I print a list of bytes as binary instead of ASCII characters? I'm trying to read the file in 8-bit stacks. Here's the code I've tried using:\n\n```python\nfile = open(filename, 'rb')\nwhile 1:\n   byte = file.read(8)\n   # Do something...\n```\n\nBut I'm not sure if this correctly reads the file byte by byte. When I collect these bytes in a list and try to print them, they output as ASCII characters. For example, I get something like this: `['10010101', '00011100', .... ]`. How can I print the bytes as raw bytes instead?"

        "content": "To read a file byte by byte in Python, you can use the `file.read(1)` method, which will read one byte at a time. If you want to read 8 bytes at a time, you can use `file.read(8)` as you've done, but this will return a bytes object containing up to 8 bytes, not individual bytes. Here's an example of how you can read a file and process it byte by byte:\n\n```python\nfilename = 'yourfile.bin'\nwith open(filename, 'rb') as file:\n    while True:\n        byte = file.read(1)  # read one byte at a time\n        if not byte:\n            break  # end of file\n        # Process the byte\n        print(f'Byte: {byte} - Binary: {format(ord(byte), \"08b\")}')\n```\n\nHowever, `ord(byte)` is not suitable for bytes in binary mode, hence use `byte[0]` to get the integer representation directly from the byte when reading binary data:\n\n```python\nfilename = 'yourfile.bin'\nwith open(filename, 'rb') as file:\n    while True:\n        byte = file.read(1)  # read one byte at a time\n        if not byte:\n            break  # end of file\n        # Process the byte\n        print(f'Byte: {byte} - Binary: {format(byte[0], \"08b\")}')\n```\n\nIf you want to read 8 bytes at a time and process them as separate bytes in a list, you can modify your code as follows:\n\n```python\nfilename = 'yourfile.bin'\nwith open(filename, 'rb') as file:\n    while True:\n        bytes_chunk = file.read(8)  # read 8 bytes at a time\n        if not bytes_chunk:\n            break  # end of file\n        # Convert each byte to its binary representation\n        binary_list = [format(byte, '08b') for byte in bytes_chunk]\n        print(binary_list)\n```\n\nThis will print out the list of bytes in binary form as you desired. Each byte is converted to an 8-character string representing the binary form of the byte using `format(byte, '08b')`."
