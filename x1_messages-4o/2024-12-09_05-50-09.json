        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"(0, 'No result set')\", typically indicates that there is no data being returned by the query, which is expected given that your query `'select * from TAB where 1 = 2'` is designed to return no rows.\n\nHere's how you can handle this situation gracefully in your code, ensuring that you do not encounter an exception and can check if the result set is empty:\n\n1. **Error Handling**: Use try-except blocks to catch exceptions and handle them properly.\n2. **Checking for Results**: After executing the query, check if any rows are returned.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Execute the SQL query\n    cursor.execute(query_sql)\n    \n    # Fetch all results\n    rs = cursor.fetchall()\n    \n    # Check if the result set is empty\n    if not rs:\n        print(\"No rows returned.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Number of rows returned: {len(rs)}\")\n        # Optionally, process the rows\n        for row in rs:\n            print(row)\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n    # Handle any exceptions that occur\n    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\nfinally:\n    # Ensure the cursor is closed if needed\n    cursor.close()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Try-Except Block**: This structure is used to attempt the execution of the code and gracefully handle any exceptions that occur.\n- **fetchall()**: This method retrieves all rows of a query result. If no rows are returned, `fetchall()` will return an empty list, which allows you to check for the absence of results using `if not rs:`.\n- **Finally Block**: Ensures that resources such as the cursor are properly closed, even if an error occurs.\n\nThis approach should help you handle the situation where no result set is returned without causing an exception in your program."
