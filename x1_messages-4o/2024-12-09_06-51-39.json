This object contains all the information about the incoming request, including its URL. Here's how you can get the information you need:\n\n1. **Determine the Host (e.g., 'localhost:5000' or 'foo.herokuapp.com'):**\n\n   You can use `request.host` to get the host part of the URL. This includes both the domain and the port (if specified).\n\n   ```python\n   from flask import Flask, request\n\n   app = Flask(__name__)\n\n   @app.route('/')\n   def index():\n       host = request.host\n       return f\"The request originated from: {host}\"\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       app.run()\n   ```\n\n2. **Get the Path that Was Requested:**\n\n   The `request.path` attribute gives you the path part of the URL.\n\n   ```python\n   @app.route('/example')\n   def example():\n       path = request.path\n       return f\"The requested path is: {path}\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Full Example:**\n\n   Here\u2019s a complete example that combines both the host and the path:\n\n   ```python\n   from flask import Flask, request\n\n   app = Flask(__name__)\n\n   @app.route('/<path:subpath>')\n   def show_subpath(subpath):\n       host = request.host\n       path = request.path\n       return f\"The request originated from: {host}, and the requested path is: {path}\"\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       app.run()\n   ```\n\nIn this example, if a request is made to `http://localhost:5000/example/test`, the response would be:\n```\nThe request originated from: localhost:5000, and the requested path is: /example/test\n```\n\nUsing these properties, you can easily determine both the host of the request and the specific path that was requested."
