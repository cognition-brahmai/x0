How can I achieve this in pandas?"

        "content": "To remove the decimal points from the numbers in your DataFrame, you can convert the floating-point numbers to integers. The `round()` function changes the display, but the underlying data type remains a float. You can achieve this by using the `astype(int)` method to convert the values to integers. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    '<=35': [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0],\n    '>35': [1.0, 0.0, 8.0, 1.0]\n}\nindex = ['Calcium', 'Copper', 'Helium', 'Hydrogen']\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data, index=index)\n\n# Convert float to int\ndf = df.astype(int)\n\n# Display the DataFrame\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThis will convert the floating-point numbers to integers and remove the decimal points, resulting in:\n\n```\nCut-off   <=35  >35\nCalcium      0    1\nCopper       1    0\nHelium       0    8\nHydrogen     0    1\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that all values are stored as integers, which removes the decimal points."
