Let's extract those letters and create a sequence.\n\nFrom \"joyful noise\" and \"singing out with every breath\", we have the musical notes: A, B, C, D, E, F, G.\n\nNow, let's create a joyful and harmonious sequence using these notes without repeating any notes:\n\nSequence: C, E, G, A, B, D, F\n\nHere is the LaTeX code to represent this musical sequence:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{standalone}\n\\usepackage{musicography}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\\begin{music}\n  \\instrumentnumber{1}\n  \\setname1{Melody}\n  \\setstaffs1{1}\n  \\generalmeter{\\meterfrac{4}{4}}\n  \\generalsignature{-3}\n  \\startextract\n    \\notes \\ibbu0C2 \\qb0C \\tbbu0 \\qb0E \\en \\bar\n    \\notes \\ibbu0G2 \\qb0G \\tbbu0 \\qb0A \\en \\bar\n    \\notes \\ibbu0B2 \\qb0B \\tbbu0 \\qb0D \\en \\bar\n    \\notes \\ibbu0F2 \\qb0F \\en \\bar\n  \\zendextract\n\\end{music}\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nThis code will produce a musical score with the sequence C, E, G, A, B, D, F, which should sound joyful and harmonious when played."
