        "content": "In Python, `type` is not a reserved keyword, but it is a built-in function. This means you can technically use `type` as a parameter name in your function without causing syntax errors. However, doing so can shadow the built-in `type` function within the scope of your function, which might lead to confusion or unintended behavior if you try to use the `type` function within that function scope.\n\nHere's a brief example to illustrate the issue:\n\n```python\ndef example(type):\n    # This will not call the built-in type function but will instead refer to the function parameter\n    print(type)\n    # Attempting to use the built-in type function will result in an error or unexpected behavior\n    print(type(123))  # This will raise a TypeError unless 'type' is callable\n```\n\nTo avoid such conflicts and maintain code clarity, it's generally good practice to choose parameter names that do not shadow built-in functions or types. You might consider using an alternative name like `property_type`, `item_type`, or `listing_type` to avoid any potential confusion or issues."
