        "content": "The poem excerpt you provided appears to deal with themes of love, commitment, and the inevitability of mortality. Here's an analysis of the underlying theme:\n\n1. **Love and Exchange**: The phrase \"with so many thousand sighs did buy each other\u2019s hearts\" suggests a deep emotional investment between two individuals. The use of the word \"buy\" implies a transactional element to their love, where both parties have given something of themselves\u2014possibly their emotions, time, and devotion\u2014to gain each other's heart.\n\n2. **Commitment**: The word \"bargainers\" indicates that the relationship involved negotiation and mutual agreement, which is often the case in committed relationships. This suggests a theme of partnership and mutual understanding.\n\n3. **Mortality**: The phrase \"Must die as bargainers do, in souls\" introduces the theme of mortality. It suggests that despite the deep connection and mutual commitment, both individuals are subject to the inevitable fate of death. The mention of \"souls\" implies that their connection transcends the physical, pointing to a spiritual or eternal bond that remains even after death.\n\nOverall, the poem seems to reflect on the profound bond formed through love and shared emotional experiences, while acknowledging the transient nature of life and the enduring connection that remains beyond physical existence."
