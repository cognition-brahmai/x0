These winds, which usually arrive from October to March, can cause wildfires in the region, and can reach speeds of up to 80 miles per hour. These winds are created when high pressure air from the Great Basin of Nevada and Arizona moves towards the coast and decrease in elevation as it approaches the Pacific Ocean."
