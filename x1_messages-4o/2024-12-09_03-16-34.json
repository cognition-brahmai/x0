The warning is '/tmp/foo:100: SyntaxWarning: import * only allowed at module level'. I understand why 'import *' is generally discouraged due to namespace invisibility, but there are many instances where it would be convenient, particularly when the code is not shared with anyone. Can anyone explain in detail why 'from <module> import *' should be prohibited in all possible cases?"

        "content": "The use of `from <module> import *` in Python is generally discouraged, and for good reason. Let's delve into the detailed reasons why it's considered problematic and why the language restricts its use to the module level:\n\n1. **Namespace Pollution**: When you use `import *`, all the public names from the module are imported into your current namespace. This can lead to conflicts or overwriting of existing variables or functions without you realizing it, especially in larger codebases or when multiple modules are involved.\n\n2. **Readability and Maintainability**: Code is often read more than it is written, and `import *` makes it unclear which names are present in the current namespace. This lack of clarity can make the code harder to understand, debug, and maintain, as other developers (or even yourself at a later time) will not know which module a particular name came from.\n\n3. **Debugging Difficulty**: When you encounter a bug, it can be challenging to determine the source of a function or variable if `import *` was used. This ambiguity can make tracing and resolving issues more time-consuming.\n\n4. **Explicit is Better Than Implicit**: Following the Zen of Python, \"Explicit is better than implicit.\" Listing the specific names you need to import makes your code more explicit and intention-revealing. It helps communicate dependencies clearly and makes it easier to see what is being used from the module.\n\n5. **Optimization and Performance**: Importing everything from a module can be inefficient, particularly if the module is large and you only need a few components. Specifying exactly what you need can help reduce memory usage and potentially improve performance.\n\n6. **Tooling Limitations**: Many tools and IDEs rely on static analysis to provide features like autocompletion, refactoring, and error detection. `import *` can hinder these tools' ability to accurately analyze the code, reducing the effectiveness of these features.\n\nDue to these reasons, Python enforces `import *` to only be used at the module level, as using it within functions or classes can exacerbate these issues by further obscuring the code structure and flow. By restricting its use, Python encourages better coding practices, promoting code that is more robust, maintainable, and clear.\n\nIn practice, it's almost always better to import only what you need. If you find yourself frequently needing many components from a module, consider importing the module itself and using its namespace, or use an alias to keep the code concise. This approach maintains clarity and minimizes the risks associated with `import *`."
