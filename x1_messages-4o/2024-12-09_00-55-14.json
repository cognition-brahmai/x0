However, I can't figure out any Python construct that multiline lambdas would clash with. So, why doesn't Python support multiline lambdas? Is it due to some ambiguity or is there another reason?"

        "content": "The primary reason Python does not support multiline lambdas is not due to syntactical conflicts with existing constructs, but rather due to the design philosophy and readability concerns of the language. Python emphasizes readability and simplicity, and its design choices often reflect these principles.\n\nHere are a few key reasons why multiline lambdas are not included in Python:\n\n1. **Readability**: Python's design philosophy, as outlined in PEP 20 (The Zen of Python), places a strong emphasis on readability and simplicity. Multiline lambdas can lead to code that is harder to read and understand, which goes against these principles. It's often clearer to define a function using the `def` keyword when it spans multiple lines.\n\n2. **Complexity**: Allowing multiline lambdas would introduce additional complexity to the language syntax and potentially to the parser. Python's creators have opted to keep the language syntax straightforward and avoid adding features that could complicate the language without providing substantial benefits.\n\n3. **Existing Alternatives**: In Python, you can achieve the same functionality as a multiline lambda by defining a regular function with `def`. This approach is explicit and often more readable, as it allows you to include docstrings, annotations, and more complex logic in a clear and structured manner.\n\n4. **Historical Context**: Python's creator, Guido van Rossum, has expressed that the language was not designed to support certain functional programming features to the same extent as languages like Lisp or Haskell. The lambda function in Python is intentionally limited to simple expressions to encourage the use of named functions for more complex logic.\n\nOverall, the decision to restrict lambdas to single expressions is a deliberate design choice aligned with Python's emphasis on code clarity and maintainability."
