I've found references to embedding Python in Sweave documents, but it seems a bit of a workaround. Is there a better solution available, or is there an equivalent tool for Python I'm not aware of?"

        "content": "For creating dynamic reports with Python scripts, similar to what Sweave does for R, you have a few great options:\n\n1. **Jupyter Notebooks**: Jupyter is a very popular tool for creating interactive documents with Python. It allows you to combine code execution, rich text, visualizations, and markdown in a single document. You can also export these notebooks to various formats, including HTML and PDF.\n\n2. **R Markdown**: While originally designed for R, R Markdown supports multiple languages, including Python. You can use the `reticulate` package to run Python code within your R Markdown documents. This can be a good solution if you are already familiar with the R Markdown ecosystem.\n\n3. **Pweave**: Pweave is a literate programming tool for Python, similar to Sweave for R. It allows you to embed Python code in your documents and weave them into a report with the results. Pweave supports LaTeX, HTML, and Markdown output formats.\n\n4. **Knitr with Python**: If you are familiar with Knitr, you can also use it to embed Python code within your documents. Knitr has support for multiple languages, including Python, so you can create reports similar to Sweave but with Python code.\n\nEach of these tools has its own strengths and use cases, so you might want to try a few to see which one fits your workflow best. If you are transitioning from R to Python, Jupyter Notebooks might be the easiest to start with due to their wide adoption and extensive community support."
