Most of the code I've encountered only return a numeric offset like -0400 or a letter code such as EDT. Is there a Python library that can provide this information or convert the offset/letter code into a human-readable name? If there are multiple human-readable names for a particular timezone, I am fine with either a list of possible results or any one of them. If there is no human-readable name for the current timezone, I am open to having an exception, None or [] as the output."

        "content": "To obtain the human-readable timezone name such as 'America/New_York' for your system's local timezone in Python, you can use the `tzlocal` and `pytz` libraries. Here\u2019s how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Install the required libraries**:\n   You need to install the `pytz` and `tzlocal` libraries if you haven't already. You can do this via pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pytz tzlocal\n   ```\n\n2. **Get the timezone name**:\n   You can use the `tzlocal` library to get the local timezone and then use the `pytz` library to convert it to a human-readable name.\n\n   Here's a sample code to do this:\n\n   ```python\n   from tzlocal import get_localzone\n   import pytz\n\n   def get_human_readable_timezone():\n       try:\n           local_zone = get_localzone()\n           # This gives you the timezone name, e.g., 'America/New_York'\n           timezone_name = local_zone.zone\n           return timezone_name\n       except Exception as e:\n           return None\n\n   timezone_name = get_human_readable_timezone()\n   print(timezone_name)\n   ```\n\nThis script will return the human-readable timezone name. If it fails to determine the timezone name, it will return `None`.\n\nThis method utilizes the system settings to determine the local timezone and then maps it to a standard timezone name using `pytz`. Keep in mind that the accuracy of the timezone name depends on the system's configuration and the libraries' ability to interpret it correctly."
