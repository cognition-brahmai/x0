To verify the correctness of my code and identify failure points, I've been using a lot of print statements. However, I understand that outputting excessive information is not a good practice. What can I do to ensure that the print statements are only used when I want to debug and are skipped when I do not want them printed?"

        "content": "To manage print statements effectively for debugging purposes, you can implement a few strategies to ensure they are only used when needed:\n\n1. **Use a Logging Library:** Instead of using print statements, utilize Python's built-in `logging` module. This allows you to control the level of logging output through different severity levels like DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. You can configure it to show messages only at a certain level or above, and easily switch between verbose debugging and silent running.\n\n   Here's a basic example of how to use the `logging` module:\n\n   ```python\n   import logging\n\n   # Configure logging\n   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n\n   # Example usage\n   logging.debug('This is a debug message')\n   logging.info('This is an info message')\n   logging.warning('This is a warning message')\n   logging.error('This is an error message')\n   logging.critical('This is a critical message')\n   ```\n\n   You can change the `level` parameter in `basicConfig` to control what messages are shown (e.g., `logging.INFO` to show only INFO and above).\n\n2. **Conditional Debugging Flag:** Implement a global or configuration-based debug flag that you can toggle as needed. This flag can be checked before printing any debug information.\n\n   ```python\n   DEBUG = True  # Set to False to disable debug prints\n\n   def debug_print(message):\n       if DEBUG:\n           print(message)\n\n   # Usage\n   debug_print('This is a debug message')\n   ```\n\n3. **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to toggle debugging. This can be particularly useful in production environments where you don't want to modify the code to change debugging settings.\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n\n   DEBUG = os.getenv('DEBUG', 'False') == 'True'\n\n   def debug_print(message):\n       if DEBUG:\n           print(message)\n\n   # Usage\n   debug_print('This is a debug message')\n   ```\n\n   You can set the environment variable in your shell before running the script:\n\n   ```sh\n   export DEBUG=True\n   python your_script.py\n   ```\n\n4. **Conditional Logging Decorators:** If you have specific functions where you want to add logging, you can create a decorator that checks the debug flag and logs accordingly.\n\n   ```python\n   import functools\n\n   def debug_logger(func):\n       @functools.wraps(func)\n       def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n           if DEBUG:\n               print(f'Calling {func.__name__} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}')\n           result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n           if DEBUG:\n               print(f'{func.__name__} returned {result}')\n           return result\n       return wrapper\n\n   @debug_logger\n   def some_function(x, y):\n       return x + y\n\n   # Usage\n   some_function(5, 7)\n   ```\n\nBy using these methods, you can have better control over when and where your debug information is output, reducing clutter in your code and improving its maintainability."
