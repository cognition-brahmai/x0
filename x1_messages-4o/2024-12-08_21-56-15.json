        "content": "Creating a regular expression to validate email addresses that can handle various domains and complexities involves ensuring the regex adheres to the standard email format specification while allowing for different valid characters and subdomains. Here's a comprehensive regex pattern that should suit these needs:\n\n```regex\n^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Local Part (`^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+`)**:\n   - `^`: Asserts the start of the string.\n   - `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+`: Matches one or more of the allowed characters in the local part of the email. These characters include:\n     - `a-zA-Z`: Letters (both uppercase and lowercase).\n     - `0-9`: Numbers.\n     - `._%+-`: Special characters that are allowed in email addresses.\n\n2. **@ Symbol (`@`)**:\n   - Matches the literal `@` symbol, which separates the local part from the domain part.\n\n3. **Domain Part (`[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$`)**:\n   - `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+`: Matches one or more of the allowed characters in the domain name, including subdomains. These characters include:\n     - `a-zA-Z`: Letters.\n     - `0-9`: Numbers.\n     - `.-`: The dot and hyphen are allowed within the domain and subdomains.\n\n   - `\\.`: Matches a literal dot `.` that separates the domain and top-level domain (TLD).\n\n   - `[a-zA-Z]{2,}`: Matches the TLD, which consists of at least two letters. This allows for various domain types like `.com`, `.edu`, `.gov`, `.org`, and many others.\n\n4. **End of String (`$`)**:\n   - Asserts the end of the string to ensure no additional characters are present after the TLD.\n\nThis regex pattern is quite robust for general email validation purposes. However, it's essential to note that while regex can be very effective for validating email formats, it doesn't guarantee that an email address is deliverable or exists. For more comprehensive validation, additional checks such as domain existence and SMTP server verification may be necessary."
