        "content": "I am working on separating the audio sources and extracting its pitch from the raw signal. I have created a model for this process, where each source oscillates in normal modes, often making its component peaks' frequency an integer multiplication, known as Harmonic. They then resonate and finally combine linearly. However, I am struggling with how to 'separate' these signals. I have tried several models, including one where I perform a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the PCM, get peak frequency bins and amplitudes, calculate pitch candidate frequency bins, and then for each pitch candidate, I use a recurrent neural network to analyze all the peaks and find the appropriate combination of peaks. I then separate the analyzed pitch candidates. Unfortunately, none of my models have been successful in separating the signal. I am seeking advice on how to solve this problem, particularly with regards to modeling of source separation like in my above-mentioned model."

        "content": "Separating audio sources and extracting their pitch is a challenging task, often referred to as source separation or pitch tracking, and it involves understanding both the harmonic structure of sounds and their temporal dynamics. Here are some strategies and techniques you can consider to improve your model:\n\n1. **Improved Feature Extraction:**\n   - Besides FFT, consider using more advanced time-frequency representations like the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) with overlapping windows or the Constant-Q Transform (CQT) which is better at capturing musical pitch information.\n   - Consider using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) or chroma features which can capture the harmonic content more effectively.\n\n2. **Machine Learning Approaches:**\n   - **Deep Learning Architectures:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be effective in learning spatial hierarchies in spectrograms, while Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks can capture temporal dependencies.\n   - **End-to-End Models:** Consider training end-to-end models that take raw audio as input and output separated sources directly. Models like Wave-U-Net, Open-Unmix, or Demucs have shown promising results for source separation.\n   - **Transfer Learning:** Use pre-trained models on tasks like music separation (e.g., Spleeter by Deezer) and fine-tune them on your specific dataset.\n\n3. **Data Augmentation and Synthesis:**\n   - Use data augmentation techniques to create a more diverse training set, including pitch shifting, time stretching, or adding noise.\n   - If you have access to isolated sources, use them to synthesize mixed signals for supervised training.\n\n4. **Advanced Signal Processing:**\n   - **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF):** This technique is useful for decomposing a spectrogram into source and activation matrices, which can help in isolating harmonic components.\n   - **Independent Component Analysis (ICA):** Useful if the signals are statistically independent and the mixing process is linear.\n\n5. **Hybrid Approaches:**\n   - Combine signal processing techniques with deep learning. For example, use NMF to initialize a deep learning model or use deep learning to refine the results of an NMF or ICA.\n\n6. **Regularization and Constraints:**\n   - Apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, such as dropout or weight decay.\n   - Incorporate domain-specific constraints, such as harmonicity or temporal continuity, into your models.\n\n7. **Evaluation and Iteration:**\n   - Consistently evaluate your models using metrics like Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR) or BSS Eval metrics.\n   - Perform error analysis to understand the limitations of your current approach and iteratively improve your model.\n\n8. **Collaboration and Resources:**\n   - Engage with the academic community, attend conferences, and read the latest papers on source separation and pitch extraction.\n   - Explore open-source projects and repositories to gain insights and inspiration for your work.\n\nBy combining these approaches, you may find a more effective strategy for audio source separation and pitch extraction in your specific context."
