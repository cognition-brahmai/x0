I understand that a dictionary is unordered, but the output comes out the same every time and I am unsure why. Here is the dictionary I am using:\n\n```python\npropertyList = {\n    \"id\":           \"int\",\n    \"name\":         \"char(40)\",\n    \"team\":         \"int\",\n    \"realOwner\":    \"int\",\n    \"x\":            \"int\",\n    \"y\":            \"int\",\n    \"description\":  \"char(255)\",\n    \"port\":         \"bool\",\n    \"secret\":       \"bool\",\n    \"dead\":         \"bool\",\n    \"nomadic\":      \"bool\",\n    \"population\":   \"int\",\n    \"slaves\":       \"int\",\n}\n```\n\nBut when I print it out with \"\\n\".join(myDict), I get this:\n\n```python\nname\nnomadic\ndead\nport\nrealOwner\nsecret\nslaves\nteam\ny\nx\npopulation\nid\ndescription\n```\n\nWhy is Python ordering my dictionary like this?"

        "content": "In Python versions prior to 3.7, dictionaries were inherently unordered collections, meaning that the order in which you inserted items was not guaranteed to be preserved when iterating over them. However, starting with Python 3.7, dictionaries maintain insertion order as an implementation detail, which means they will preserve the order of elements as they were added. In Python 3.8 and later, this behavior is officially part of the language specification.\n\nThe order you are observing with your `propertyList` dictionary might be due to several reasons:\n\n1. **Python Version**: Ensure you are using Python 3.7 or later. In these versions, the dictionary should maintain the insertion order, so the output should match the order you defined.\n\n2. **Environment**: If you're using an environment that might manipulate dictionary order (such as some older Python development environments or systems), it might produce unexpected behavior. Verify the Python version in your environment.\n\n3. **Code Execution**: Double-check that the dictionary is defined and printed in the same execution context without any intermediate modifications.\n\nTo properly print your dictionary keys while maintaining the insertion order, you can use:\n\n```python\nprint(\"\\n\".join(propertyList.keys()))\n```\n\nThis will explicitly iterate over the keys in the order they were added to the dictionary, assuming you're using Python 3.7 or later. If your Python version is correct and the order is still off, you might want to look into how the environment or context might be affecting dictionary order."
