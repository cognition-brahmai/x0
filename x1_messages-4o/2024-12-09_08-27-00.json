I have tried the following codes:\n\nFor Python 2.5 and 2.7, I used:\n```python\ntry:\n    print(10 * (1/0))\nexcept ZeroDivisionError,  error:       # old skool\n    print(\"Yep, error caught:\", error)\n```\nAnd for Python 2.7 and 3.2, I used:\n```python\ntry:\n    print(10 * (1/0))\nexcept (ZeroDivisionError) as error:    # 'as' is needed by Python 3\n    print(\"Yep, error caught:\", error)\n```\nIs there any code that would be compatible with all these versions?"

        "content": "To write error handling code that is compatible across Python 2.5, 2.7, and 3.x versions, you need to accommodate the differences in exception handling syntax. In Python 2.5, the `except Exception, e` syntax is used, while in Python 2.6+, the `except Exception as e` syntax is supported. However, Python 3.x requires the `as` keyword.\n\nOne way to achieve compatibility is to use a try-except block within a try-except block to handle the syntax differences. Here\u2019s a way to do it:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ntry:\n    try:\n        print(10 * (1/0))\n    except ZeroDivisionError as error:\n        print(\"Yep, error caught:\", error)\nexcept SyntaxError:\n    # Fallback for Python 2.5 syntax\n    exec(\"\"\"\ntry:\n    print(10 * (1/0))\nexcept ZeroDivisionError, error:\n    print(\"Yep, error caught:\", error)\n\"\"\")\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The outer `try-except` block tries to execute the code using the Python 2.6+ and 3.x syntax (`except Exception as error`).\n2. If it encounters a `SyntaxError` (which would happen in Python 2.5), it falls back to using `exec` to run a string containing the older syntax (`except Exception, error`).\n\nThis approach ensures compatibility across the versions you specified."
