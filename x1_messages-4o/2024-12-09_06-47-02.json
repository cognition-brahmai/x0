        "content": "What is the most efficient way to handle default settings in a Django app if one is not defined in `settings.py`? I have currently placed a `default_settings` file in the app and I am considering several options.\n\nHere are the options I've considered:\n\n1. Place settings in a function and iterate over locals / set globals:\n\n```python\ndef setup_defaults():\n    FOO = 'bar'\n    for key, value in locals().items():\n        globals()[key] = getattr(settings, key, value)\n\nsetup_defaults()\n```\nPros: Only have to write var name once to pull default of same name from Django settings.\nCons: Not used to using globals() and don't know of any implications\n\n2. Write `getattr(settings, 'MY_SETTING', default_settings.MY_SETTING)` every call\nPros: Very clear.\nCons: Repetitive\n\n3. Always define settings as `FOO = getattr(settings, 'FOO', '...setting here...')`\nPros: Defaults are always overridden\nCons: Repetitive (must define var twice - once in string form, once in var), Setting is not as readable since it's now the third argument\n\n4. Create utility function to `get_or_default(setting)`\nPros: Simple, Don't have to repeat string representation of setting\nCons: Have to call it\n\n5. Create a settings class\n\n```python\nclass Settings(object):\n    FOO = 'bar'\n\n    def __init__(self):\n         # filter out the startswith('__') of \n         # self.__dict__.items() / compare to django.conf.settings?\n\nmy_settings = Settings()\n```\nCons: Can't do from foo.bar.my_settings import FOO (actually, that's a terrible deal breaker!)\n\nI would appreciate any feedback or suggestions on the best approach to take."

        "content": "Handling default settings in a Django app can be approached in several ways, each with its own pros and cons as you've outlined. Let's evaluate each option and consider some best practices:\n\n### 1. Function with `globals()`\n\n**Pros**: \n- Elegance in setting defaults once and using them globally.\n\n**Cons**: \n- Using `globals()` can be unpredictable and is generally discouraged because it can lead to hard-to-trace bugs and conflicts, especially in larger projects or when dealing with multi-threading.\n\n### 2. Using `getattr` for each call\n\n**Pros**: \n- Explicit and clear, making it easy to understand where each setting comes from.\n\n**Cons**: \n- Repetitive and cumbersome if the number of settings grows.\n\n### 3. `getattr` with inline defaults\n\n**Pros**: \n- Allows quick definition of defaults directly in the code.\n\n**Cons**: \n- Still repetitive if many settings need defaults, and the third argument might reduce readability.\n\n### 4. Utility function `get_or_default`\n\n**Pros**: \n- Centralizes the logic for retrieving settings, reducing repetition.\n\n**Cons**: \n- Requires an extra function call, but this is a minor downside compared to the clarity it provides.\n\n### 5. Settings Class\n\n**Pros**: \n- Encapsulation of settings, potentially allowing for more complex logic if needed.\n\n**Cons**: \n- The inability to import individual settings is indeed a dealbreaker for many use cases.\n\n### Suggested Approach\n\nConsidering maintainability, readability, and simplicity, I recommend combining options 4 and a simplified version of 5:\n\n1. **Utility Function**: Create a utility function to handle the default logic. This keeps your settings retrieval DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and clear.\n\n2. **Settings Module/Class**: Use a simple module or class to encapsulate the defaults, keeping it easy to update and manage.\n\nHere's an example combining these approaches:\n\n```python\n# default_settings.py\nDEFAULTS = {\n    'FOO': 'bar',\n    'BAZ': 'qux',\n    # Add other default settings here\n}\n\n# utils.py\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom .default_settings import DEFAULTS\n\ndef get_or_default(setting_name):\n    return getattr(settings, setting_name, DEFAULTS.get(setting_name))\n\n# usage in your app\nFOO = get_or_default('FOO')\nBAZ = get_or_default('BAZ')\n```\n\n### Advantages of This Approach:\n\n- **Centralized Defaults**: Keeps all defaults in one place, making it easy to manage.\n- **Clear Usage**: Using a function like `get_or_default` makes it clear where defaults are applied.\n- **Maintainability**: Easy to update and add new settings without extensive code changes.\n\nBy using a utility function and default settings dictionary, you strike a balance between clarity, maintainability, and ease of use."
