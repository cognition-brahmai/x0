This seems incorrect as the buffer lists this buffer as `*ansi-term*` which is confusing when I have multiple terminals opened, one of which is dedicated to Python. I also noticed that I can open a python interpreter directly with `M-x python-shell`. Is there a similar function for IPython? I'm using Emacs 24 with Prelude."

        "content": "To open an IPython interpreter within Emacs, you can use the built-in support for IPython in the `python.el` package, which is part of Emacs. This allows you to have an integrated IPython shell that works similarly to the standard Python shell but with IPython enhancements. Here\u2019s how you can set it up:\n\n1. **Install IPython**: Make sure you have IPython installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install ipython\n   ```\n\n2. **Configure Emacs for IPython**:\n\n   You need to configure the Python shell to use IPython instead of the default Python interpreter. You can do this by customizing the Python shell settings in your Emacs configuration file (`~/.emacs.d/init.el` or `~/.emacs`):\n\n   ```elisp\n   (setq python-shell-interpreter \"ipython\"\n         python-shell-interpreter-args \"--simple-prompt -i\")\n   ```\n\n   The `--simple-prompt` argument is necessary for IPython versions 5 and above to work correctly within Emacs.\n\n3. **Start the IPython Shell**:\n\n   Once you have configured it, you can start the IPython shell by running:\n\n   ```elisp\n   M-x run-python\n   ```\n\n   This will open a new buffer with the IPython interpreter running, and it should be listed under `*Python*` or similar, making it easy to identify among other buffers.\n\n4. **Using Prelude**:\n\n   Since you are using Emacs Prelude, ensure that Prelude's Python support is enabled. Prelude should automatically pick up your `python-shell-interpreter` settings, but if you encounter issues, double-check your Prelude configuration.\n\nBy following these steps, you should have a better integrated experience with IPython in Emacs, avoiding the confusion of using `*ansi-term*` and taking full advantage of IPython\u2019s features like syntax highlighting and enhanced introspection."
