I keep getting an error that says \"Legend does not support [matplotlib.lines.Line2D object]\" and it advises to use a proxy artist instead. This error occurs even with simple scripts like the one provided below. I've tried using the link provided in the error message to help diagnose the problem, but I haven't found it very useful. How can I resolve this issue?\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\na = [1,2,3]\nb = [4,5,6]\nc = [7,8,9]\n\nplot1 = plt.plot(a,b)\nplot2 = plt.plot(a,c)\n\nplt.legend([plot1,plot2],[\"plot 1\", \"plot 2\"])\nplt.show()\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to how the `plt.plot()` function returns a list of `Line2D` objects, not just a single `Line2D` object. When you try to pass `[plot1, plot2]` to `plt.legend()`, you're essentially passing a list of lists, which causes the error.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to extract the `Line2D` objects from the lists returned by `plt.plot()` and pass them individually to `plt.legend()`. You can do this by accessing the first element of each list. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\na = [1, 2, 3]\nb = [4, 5, 6]\nc = [7, 8, 9]\n\n# Get the Line2D objects from the plot calls\nplot1, = plt.plot(a, b, label=\"plot 1\")\nplot2, = plt.plot(a, c, label=\"plot 2\")\n\n# Use the label attributes for legend\nplt.legend()\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this code, `plot1, = plt.plot(a, b)` assigns the first (and only) `Line2D` object from the list to `plot1`. This way, `plt.legend()` can correctly interpret the line objects and create the legend with the specified labels. Additionally, by using the `label` parameter in the `plot()` function, you can simplify the legend creation by calling `plt.legend()` without any arguments."
