        "content": "The error you're encountering is expected due to how in-memory SQLite databases work. When you create a database with `sqlite3.connect(':memory:')`, it is stored only in the memory of the process that created it. Each `:memory:` database is unique to the process that created it, which means separate processes cannot share the same in-memory database.\n\n### Why You're Seeing the Error:\n\n1. **Separate Memory Spaces**: Each process has its own memory space. When you create an in-memory SQLite database in one process, it does not exist in the memory space of another process. Therefore, the second process doesn't see the table created in the first process.\n\n2. **`:memory:` Usage**: The `':memory:'` identifier tells SQLite to create a new database in the RAM of the current process. This is why the second process doesn't find the table\u2014it\u2019s looking in its own separate in-memory database.\n\n### Solutions:\n\n1. **File-based Database**: Use a file-based SQLite database instead of an in-memory one. This way, both processes can access the same database file on disk:\n\n    ```python\n    # Process 1\n    import sqlite3\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')\n    c = conn.cursor()\n    c.execute(\"create table test(testcolumn)\")\n    c.execute(\"insert into test values('helloooo')\")\n    conn.commit()\n    conn.close()\n    ```\n\n    ```python\n    # Process 2\n    import sqlite3\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')\n    c = conn.cursor()\n    c.execute(\"select * from test\")\n    for row in c.fetchall():\n        print(row)\n    conn.close()\n    ```\n\n2. **Shared Cache**: SQLite provides a \"shared cache\" mode which allows multiple connections from the same process to share the same in-memory database. However, this does not extend to different processes and is typically used for more advanced setups within the same application.\n\n3. **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**: If you really need to share data between processes without writing to disk, you might consider using some form of IPC like sockets, shared memory, or a message broker.\n\nFor most use cases, using a file-based SQLite database is the simplest and most effective way to allow multiple processes to access the same database."
