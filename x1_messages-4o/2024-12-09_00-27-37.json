        "content": "It seems like there's a misunderstanding or an error in the result you're encountering in your application. The division of `8` by `-7` should not yield `-2` as an integer result. Let's break it down:\n\nWhen you divide two integers, the result should be a floating-point number unless some form of integer division or rounding is taking place. In standard arithmetic:\n\n\\[ \\frac{8}{-7} = -1.142857... \\]\n\nThis is a repeating decimal and not an integer. However, if your application is performing integer division, it might be truncating the decimal part and only considering the integer portion. In many programming languages, integer division of `8` by `-7` would result in `-1`, as it truncates towards zero.\n\nIf your application is returning `-2`, there might be a bug or specific logic that is causing an incorrect rounding or truncation. Check your code to see if there are any custom rules or methods applied during division that might lead to such a result. Also, ensure that the data types and division operations are correctly implemented according to your expectations."
