I have tried using a `.pth` file in the same directory as a script I'm executing, but it seems to be ignored. I'm working with Python 2.7 on Windows. I've located the Windows per-user installation directory at `%APPDATA%\\Python\\Python27\\site-packages` and I can import a module by placing it there, but a `.pth` file doesn't seem to work. Is there another directory where I could place `extras.pth` to make it visible?\n\nHere's the content of my `extras.pth` file:\n\n```\nN:\\PythonExtras\\lib\\site-packages\n```\n\nAnd this is the script I'm using to test:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nprint r\"N:\\PythonExtras\\lib\\site-packages\" in sys.path\n```\n\nThis script prints `False`, which means the path isn't added to `sys.path`. Am I missing something or is there a better way to do this?"

        "content": "In Python, `.pth` files are used to add additional directories to the `sys.path`. However, for a `.pth` file to be recognized, it has to be placed in a directory that is already on the `sys.path` when Python starts, such as the `site-packages` directory.\n\nSince you mentioned that you're working with Python 2.7 on Windows and have located the per-user site-packages directory at `%APPDATA%\\Python\\Python27\\site-packages`, placing the `.pth` file there should work. However, if it's not working, there might be a few things to check or try:\n\n1. **File Encoding and Format**: Ensure the `.pth` file is a plain text file and does not contain any hidden characters or BOM (Byte Order Mark). Use a simple text editor like Notepad to create or check the file.\n\n2. **Correct Location**: Double-check that the `.pth` file is indeed in the `%APPDATA%\\Python\\Python27\\site-packages` directory. You can verify this by printing the `sys.path` in your script and ensuring that this directory is included.\n\n3. **File Permissions**: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to read the file. This shouldn't be an issue in the per-user directory, but it's worth checking.\n\n4. **Syntax in `.pth` File**: The path in the `.pth` file should be on a single line without any leading or trailing spaces. Ensure that `N:\\PythonExtras\\lib\\site-packages` is on its own line.\n\n5. **Python Startup Behavior**: Python reads `.pth` files during its startup phase. If your environment or script does anything unusual during startup, it might interfere with this process.\n\n6. **Testing with Simplified Script**: Run a simpler test script to isolate the issue. Create a Python file with the following content and run it:\n\n    ```python\n    import site\n    site.addsitedir(r'N:\\PythonExtras\\lib\\site-packages')\n    import sys\n    print r'N:\\PythonExtras\\lib\\site-packages' in sys.path\n    ```\n\n   This script manually adds the path and checks if it works. If this works, it confirms that the issue lies with the `.pth` file not being processed.\n\n7. **Alternative Solutions**: If the `.pth` file doesn't work despite trying the above suggestions, consider using a virtual environment. With a virtual environment, you can manage packages locally without requiring global access. Python 2.7 supports virtual environments through the `virtualenv` tool, which you can install and use to create a local environment where you have full control over the `site-packages` directory.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to make the module discoverable without needing to change the `PYTHONPATH` or having write access to the global `site-packages` directory."
