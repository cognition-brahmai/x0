        "content": "Yes, you can calculate the geometric mean in Python without using any external packages by implementing it manually. The geometric mean is the nth root of the product of n numbers. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef geometric_mean(numbers):\n    product = 1.0\n    n = len(numbers)\n    \n    for number in numbers:\n        product *= number\n    \n    # Calculate the nth root\n    geom_mean = product ** (1/n)\n    \n    return geom_mean\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = geometric_mean(numbers)\nprint(\"Geometric Mean:\", result)\n```\n\nThis code calculates the geometric mean by multiplying all the numbers together and then taking the nth root of the product, where n is the number of elements in the list.\n\nIf you prefer using a package, the `statistics` package in Python 3.8 and later includes a function to calculate the geometric mean. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nimport statistics\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = statistics.geometric_mean(numbers)\nprint(\"Geometric Mean:\", result)\n```\n\nBoth methods will give you the geometric mean of a list of numbers."
