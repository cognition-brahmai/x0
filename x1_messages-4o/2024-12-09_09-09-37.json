        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this by using a programming language like Python. Here's a simple Python function that takes an array of integers as input and returns a new array without any duplicate elements:\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(array):\n    # Convert the array to a set to remove duplicates\n    unique_elements = set(array)\n    # Convert the set back to a list\n    return list(unique_elements)\n\n# Example usage\ninput_array = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]\noutput_array = remove_duplicates(input_array)\nprint(\"Array without duplicates:\", output_array)\n```\n\nThis code works by first converting the input array to a set, which inherently removes any duplicate elements because sets do not allow duplicates. Then, it converts the set back to a list, which is returned as the output.\n\nIf you want to maintain the order of the original array while removing duplicates, you can use the following approach:\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates_preserve_order(array):\n    # Create an empty list to store unique elements\n    unique_elements = []\n    # Create a set to keep track of seen elements\n    seen_elements = set()\n    # Iterate through the input array\n    for element in array:\n        # If the element has not been seen, add it to the result\n        if element not in seen_elements:\n            unique_elements.append(element)\n            seen_elements.add(element)\n    return unique_elements\n\n# Example usage\ninput_array = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]\noutput_array = remove_duplicates_preserve_order(input_array)\nprint(\"Array without duplicates (order preserved):\", output_array)\n```\n\nThis version of the function iterates through the input array and keeps track of the elements that have already been seen using a set. It only adds elements to the result list if they haven't been encountered before, thus preserving the order of the first occurrence of each element."
