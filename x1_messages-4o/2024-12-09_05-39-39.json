        "content": "The error you're encountering is because `urllib2` is not available in Python 3.x. In Python 3, the `urllib` module has been split into several modules, so `urllib2` has been replaced with parts of the `urllib` module. Here's how you can adapt your code to work with Python 3:\n\n1. **Replace `urllib2` with `urllib.request`:**\n\n   If you're using `urllib2` for opening URLs, you should now use `urllib.request` in Python 3. Here's an example of how to update your code:\n\n   ```python\n   # Python 2.x code\n   # import urllib2\n   # response = urllib2.urlopen('http://example.com/')\n   # html = response.read()\n\n   # Updated Python 3.x code\n   import urllib.request\n   response = urllib.request.urlopen('http://example.com/')\n   html = response.read()\n   ```\n\n2. **Handling exceptions:**\n\n   In Python 3, `urllib2.HTTPError` and `urllib2.URLError` are now part of `urllib.error`. So, if you are handling exceptions, you should import them from `urllib.error`:\n\n   ```python\n   # Python 2.x code\n   # import urllib2\n   # try:\n   #     response = urllib2.urlopen('http://example.com/')\n   # except urllib2.HTTPError as e:\n   #     print('HTTPError: ', e.code)\n   # except urllib2.URLError as e:\n   #     print('URLError: ', e.reason)\n\n   # Updated Python 3.x code\n   import urllib.request\n   import urllib.error\n   try:\n       response = urllib.request.urlopen('http://example.com/')\n   except urllib.error.HTTPError as e:\n       print('HTTPError: ', e.code)\n   except urllib.error.URLError as e:\n       print('URLError: ', e.reason)\n   ```\n\n3. **Installing Python 3.x:**\n\n   If your current setup is for Python 3.2, consider upgrading to a more recent version of Python 3, as Python 3.2 is quite outdated and might lack support for newer libraries and features. You can download the latest version from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\nBy making these changes, you should be able to resolve the \"ImportError: No module named urllib2\" issue on Windows."
