I am trying to perform the operation `X*y` but I am getting the following error: `ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (97,2) (2,1)`. I understand that `(97,2)x(2,1)` is a valid matrix operation and should give me a `(97,1)` vector. However, I am unable to understand why I am encountering this error. I have managed to get around this issue using `X.dot(y)` but I am still curious to understand why the original operation didn't work."

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to how NumPy handles broadcasting for element-wise operations, which is different from traditional matrix multiplication.\n\nIn NumPy, the `*` operator performs element-wise multiplication, not matrix multiplication. For element-wise operations, NumPy uses a broadcasting mechanism to allow operations on arrays of different shapes, but certain rules must be followed for broadcasting to be successful:\n\n1. **Arrays must have the same shape** or\n2. **One of the arrays must have a dimension of size 1**, so it can be broadcast (stretched) to match the shape of the other array.\n\nIn your case, you have `X` with shape `(97, 2)` and `y` with shape `(2, 1)`. For the element-wise multiplication `X * y` to work, NumPy tries to broadcast the arrays to a common shape. Here's what happens:\n\n- The first dimension of `X` is 97, and the first dimension of `y` is 2. These are incompatible for broadcasting because they are not equal and neither is 1.\n- The second dimension of `X` is 2, and the second dimension of `y` is 1. These are compatible for broadcasting.\n\nBecause the first dimensions are not compatible (97 vs. 2), NumPy cannot perform the element-wise multiplication and throws a `ValueError`.\n\nIn contrast, `X.dot(y)` or `np.dot(X, y)` performs matrix multiplication, which is a different operation. In matrix multiplication, the number of columns in the first matrix must match the number of rows in the second matrix, which is true in your case (2 columns in `X` and 2 rows in `y`). The result is a `(97, 1)` array, as you expected.\n\nIf you want to perform element-wise multiplication with broadcasting, you would need to reshape `y` to have a shape of `(1, 2)` or `(97, 2)` (by repeating the rows), so that its first dimension can be broadcast to match `X`. However, in your case, since you're looking for matrix multiplication, `X.dot(y)` is the correct approach."
