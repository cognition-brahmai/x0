        "content": "Yes, there are several Python libraries that can help you expand English language contractions. One popular library for this task is `contractions`. This library provides a simple way to expand contractions in text. Here's how you can use it:\n\n1. **Install the library**:\n   You can install the `contractions` library using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install contractions\n   ```\n\n2. **Use the library**:\n   Once installed, you can easily expand contractions in your text. Here's a simple example:\n\n   ```python\n   import contractions\n\n   text = \"You've been working hard, and he's noticed it.\"\n   expanded_text = contractions.fix(text)\n\n   print(expanded_text)\n   ```\n\n   Output:\n   ```\n   You have been working hard, and he is noticed it.\n   ```\n\nThe `contractions` library uses a predefined mapping of common contractions to their expanded forms, making it a reliable choice for most use cases. Additionally, you can always customize or extend its contraction mappings if you encounter contractions that are not covered by default."
