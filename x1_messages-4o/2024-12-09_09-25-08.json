        "content": "You can use Python to send an email with a specific subject and body using the `smtplib` library, which is part of Python's standard library. Below is an example of how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport smtplib\nfrom email.mime.text import MIMEText\nfrom email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart\n\ndef send_email(subject, body, to_email, from_email, smtp_server, smtp_port, login, password):\n    # Create a multipart message\n    msg = MIMEMultipart()\n    msg['From'] = from_email\n    msg['To'] = to_email\n    msg['Subject'] = subject\n\n    # Attach the body to the message\n    msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))\n\n    try:\n        # Connect to the SMTP server\n        server = smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, smtp_port)\n        server.starttls()  # Secure the connection\n\n        # Log in to the server\n        server.login(login, password)\n\n        # Send the email\n        server.sendmail(from_email, to_email, msg.as_string())\n\n        print(\"Email sent successfully\")\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Failed to send email: {e}\")\n\n    finally:\n        # Disconnect from the server\n        server.quit()\n\n# Example usage\nsubject = \"Your Subject Here\"\nbody = \"This is the body of the email\"\nto_email = \"recipient@example.com\"\nfrom_email = \"your_email@example.com\"\nsmtp_server = \"smtp.example.com\"\nsmtp_port = 587\nlogin = \"your_email@example.com\"\npassword = \"your_email_password\"\n\nsend_email(subject, body, to_email, from_email, smtp_server, smtp_port, login, password)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **`smtplib`**: This module defines an SMTP client session object that can be used to send mail to any Internet machine with an SMTP or ESMTP listener daemon.\n\n2. **`email.mime.text` and `email.mime.multipart`**: These modules are used to create MIME objects that encapsulate the email body and provide support for attachments.\n\n3. **`MIMEMultipart`**: This is used to create a message object with multiple parts (here, just one part, the text content).\n\n4. **`MIMEText`**: This is used to define the email body as plain text.\n\n5. **SMTP Server Details**: You'll need to replace `smtp.example.com`, `your_email@example.com`, and `your_email_password` with your SMTP server details and email credentials.\n\n6. **Security**: The code uses `starttls()` to secure the SMTP connection. You should ensure that your credentials are handled securely and not exposed in your code or version control systems.\n\nThis script is a simple demonstration. For production use, consider using environment variables or secure vaults to manage sensitive information like passwords."
