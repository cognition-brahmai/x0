I want to return a boolean value indicating if the given date is within three days from today's date. I am only dealing with date, not datetime. This is for a \"grace period\" function in my website where if the grace period is within three days of today, additional scripts are omitted for the user. Where should I look in Python's date module to achieve this?"

        "content": "To check if a given date is within a specific range of today's date in Python, you can use the `datetime` module. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n1. Import the `datetime` module.\n2. Parse the given date string into a `datetime.date` object.\n3. Get today's date.\n4. Calculate the date range (e.g., three days before and after today).\n5. Check if the given date falls within this range.\n\nBelow is a sample code that demonstrates this process:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\ndef is_within_grace_period(date_str):\n    # Parse the given date string into a date object\n    given_date = datetime.strptime(date_str, \"%Y-%m-%d\").date()\n\n    # Get today's date\n    today = datetime.today().date()\n\n    # Calculate the start and end of the grace period range\n    start_date = today - timedelta(days=3)\n    end_date = today + timedelta(days=3)\n\n    # Check if the given date is within the grace period range\n    return start_date <= given_date <= end_date\n\n# Example usage\ndate_str = \"2011-01-15\"\nis_within_range = is_within_grace_period(date_str)\nprint(is_within_range)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The `datetime.strptime` method is used to convert the date string into a `datetime.date` object.\n- `datetime.today().date()` gives the current date.\n- `timedelta(days=3)` is used to calculate three days before and after today.\n- The expression `start_date <= given_date <= end_date` checks if the given date is within the calculated date range.\n\nYou can adjust the number of days in the `timedelta` function to change the grace period as needed."
