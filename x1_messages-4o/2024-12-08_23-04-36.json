In response to the growing tensions, several countries came together to form the Allied powers. The end of the war marked the beginning of a period of intense negotiation and diplomacy, which ultimately led to the formation of the UN. One of the most significant events that led to the creation of the UN was the devastation and loss of life caused by World War II. The UN was officially established on October 24, 1945, with 51 member states. To provide a timeline of these events, we can use the following shell command: history | grep UN-establishment]"
