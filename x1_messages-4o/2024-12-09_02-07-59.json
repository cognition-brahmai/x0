I recently faced an issue with mutable default arguments in a PDF generation function, where \"Table of Contents\" kept getting longer with each invocation of \"generate pdf\". I also want to avoid issues like treating modules imported in different ways as different modules, mistakenly using 'range' in place of lists, and handling multiple exception types incorrectly."

        "content": "Certainly! Python, while being a powerful and flexible language, has some common pitfalls that you should be aware of to avoid unexpected behavior. Here\u2019s a list of some common pitfalls along with tips on how to avoid them:\n\n1. **Mutable Default Arguments**: \n   - **Pitfall**: Using mutable objects (like lists or dictionaries) as default values for function arguments can cause unexpected behavior because they maintain state across function calls.\n   - **Solution**: Use `None` as the default value and then initialize the mutable object inside the function.\n     ```python\n     def generate_pdf(toc=None):\n         if toc is None:\n             toc = []\n         # rest of your code\n     ```\n\n2. **Importing Modules Differently**:\n   - **Pitfall**: Importing the same module in different ways can lead to them being treated as different modules, leading to potential conflicts.\n   - **Solution**: Stick to a consistent import style and use relative imports within packages to avoid this issue.\n\n3. **Using `range` Instead of Lists**:\n   - **Pitfall**: In Python 3, `range` returns an immutable sequence, not a list. If you try to use list-specific operations on it, you\u2019ll run into issues.\n   - **Solution**: Convert `range` to a list explicitly if you need list-specific operations.\n     ```python\n     numbers = list(range(10))\n     ```\n\n4. **Handling Multiple Exception Types**:\n   - **Pitfall**: Using a bare `except:` can catch all exceptions, including system-exiting exceptions like `SystemExit` and `KeyboardInterrupt`, which can make debugging difficult.\n   - **Solution**: Always specify the exceptions you want to catch.\n     ```python\n     try:\n         # some code\n     except (TypeError, ValueError) as e:\n         # handle specific exceptions\n     ```\n\n5. **Modifying a List While Iterating**:\n   - **Pitfall**: Modifying a list (e.g., adding or removing elements) while iterating over it can lead to unexpected behavior.\n   - **Solution**: Iterate over a copy of the list or use list comprehensions to create a new list.\n     ```python\n     for item in my_list[:]:  # iterate over a slice copy\n         # modify my_list\n     ```\n\n6. **Object Equality vs Identity**:\n   - **Pitfall**: Confusing `==` (equality) with `is` (identity) can lead to logic errors.\n   - **Solution**: Use `==` to compare equality and `is` to compare object identity.\n\n7. **Shadowing Built-in Names**:\n   - **Pitfall**: Naming variables or functions the same as Python built-ins (like `list`, `dict`, `str`) can override these built-ins.\n   - **Solution**: Avoid using built-in names for your variables and functions.\n\n8. **Misunderstanding Variable Scope**:\n   - **Pitfall**: Variables defined inside a function are local and do not affect global variables. Similarly, modifying a global variable requires the `global` keyword.\n   - **Solution**: Use the `global` keyword if you need to modify a global variable within a function.\n\n9. **Iterating Over Changing Dictionaries**:\n   - **Pitfall**: Modifying a dictionary while iterating over it can cause runtime errors.\n   - **Solution**: Iterate over a copy of the dictionary\u2019s keys or items.\n     ```python\n     for key in list(my_dict.keys()):\n         # modify my_dict\n     ```\n\n10. **Unexpected Behavior with `*args` and `**kwargs`**:\n    - **Pitfall**: Misusing or misunderstanding the purpose of `*args` and `**kwargs` can lead to unexpected behavior.\n    - **Solution**: Use them appropriately to capture variable-length arguments and keyword arguments in function definitions.\n\nBy being mindful of these common pitfalls and implementing the solutions provided, you can write more robust and error-free Python code."
