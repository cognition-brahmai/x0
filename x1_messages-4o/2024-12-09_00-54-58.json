I'm using ubuntu14.04, python2.7, CUDA toolkit 8.0 and CuDNN v5, with versions six 1.10.0 and protobuf 3.2.0. When I try to run the following code:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\na = tf.placeholder(tf.int16)\nb = tf.placeholder(tf.int16)\nadd = tf.add(a, b)\nmul = tf.mul(a, b)\nwith tf.Session() as sess:\n    # Run every operation with variable input\n    print \"Addition with variables: %i\" % sess.run(add, feed_dict={a: 2, b: 3})\n    print \"Multiplication with variables: %i\" % sess.run(mul, feed_dict={a: 2, b: 3})\n```\n\nI get an error: `AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'mul'`. I wanted to know if there's any issue with my TensorFlow installation or if there are any other problems causing this error."

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the use of `tf.mul`, which is not a valid function in TensorFlow. In TensorFlow, element-wise multiplication is performed using `tf.multiply`. The `tf.mul` function was deprecated and eventually removed in TensorFlow.\n\nHere's how you can fix your code:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\na = tf.placeholder(tf.int16)\nb = tf.placeholder(tf.int16)\nadd = tf.add(a, b)\nmul = tf.multiply(a, b)  # Use tf.multiply instead of tf.mul\nwith tf.Session() as sess:\n    # Run every operation with variable input\n    print(\"Addition with variables: %i\" % sess.run(add, feed_dict={a: 2, b: 3}))\n    print(\"Multiplication with variables: %i\" % sess.run(mul, feed_dict={a: 2, b: 3}))\n```\n\nAdditionally, since you're using Python 2.7, I noticed you were using the `print` statement without parentheses. However, the parentheses are necessary for compatibility with Python 3. The modified code above includes this change. \n\nLastly, consider upgrading your Python and TensorFlow versions, as both Python 2.7 and TensorFlow versions compatible with it are no longer supported or receiving updates. Upgrading will provide you with access to the latest features and improvements."
