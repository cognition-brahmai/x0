        "content": "To calculate a Gaussian kernel matrix more efficiently in NumPy, you can leverage matrix operations to avoid the explicit double loop over data points. The idea is to compute pairwise squared distances between all points in a vectorized form. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef GaussianMatrix(X, sigma):\n    X = np.asarray(X)\n    pairwise_sq_dists = np.sum(X**2, axis=1).reshape(-1, 1) + np.sum(X**2, axis=1) - 2 * np.dot(X, X.T)\n    GassMatrix = np.exp(-pairwise_sq_dists / (2 * sigma**2))\n    return GassMatrix\n\n# Example usage\nX = np.random.rand(100, 2)  # 100 points in 2D\nsigma = 1.0\nGassMatrix = GaussianMatrix(X, sigma)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Pairwise Squared Distances**: \n   - \\( \\text{pairwise\\_sq\\_dists} \\) is computed using the formula \\( \\|x_i - x_j\\|^2 = \\|x_i\\|^2 + \\|x_j\\|^2 - 2x_i \\cdot x_j \\).\n   - \\( \\sum X^2 \\) computes the squared norms of each point.\n   - \\( \\text{X} \\cdot \\text{X}^T \\) computes the dot product between all pairs of points.\n\n2. **Gaussian Kernel**:\n   - The Gaussian kernel matrix is computed by applying the Gaussian function to the pairwise squared distances.\n\nThis approach is vectorized and takes advantage of NumPy's efficient array operations, making it significantly faster, especially for larger datasets."
