What would be a simple way to accomplish this?"

Here's how you can modify your function to accomplish that:\n\n```python\ndef find_path(i_file):\n    lines = open(i_file).readlines()\n    for line in lines:\n        if line.startswith(\"Path=\"):\n            return line.split(\"=\", 1)[1].strip()\n\n# Example usage\nfile_path = 'your_file.txt'\npath_value = find_path(file_path)\nprint(path_value)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `split(\"=\", 1)` splits the string into two parts at the first occurrence of the \"=\" character.\n- `[1]` accesses the second part of the split result, which is the value after \"Path=\".\n- `strip()` is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace or newline characters from the result.\n\nThis should give you the desired value from lines that start with \"Path=\"."
