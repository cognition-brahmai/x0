        "content": "To remove all characters before a specific character or set of characters in a string, you can use Python's string methods. In your example, you want to remove all characters before `I'm` in the string `intro = \"<>I'm Tom.\"`. You can achieve this by using the `str.split()` method or `str.find()` method, along with string slicing.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n### Method 1: Using `str.split()`\n\n```python\nintro = \"<>I'm Tom.\"\n# Split the string at \"I\" and take the part after it\nresult = intro.split(\"I\", 1)[1]\n# Add \"I\" back to the beginning\nresult = \"I\" + result\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using `str.find()`\n\n```python\nintro = \"<>I'm Tom.\"\n# Find the index of \"I\"\nindex = intro.find(\"I\")\n# Slice the string from the index of \"I\"\nresult = intro[index:]\nprint(result)\n```\n\nBoth methods will give you the result:\n\n```\nI'm Tom.\n```\n\nThese methods work by identifying the position of the character you want to start from (`I` in this case) and then slicing the string from that position onward."
