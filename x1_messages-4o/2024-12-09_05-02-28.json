I don't understand why Python doesn't produce an error when the number of quotes doesn't match. Consider the following examples:\n```python\n>>> \"OK\"\n'OK'\n>>> \"\"\"OK\"\"\"\n'OK'\n>>> \"not Ok'\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1\n    \"not Ok'\n           ^\nSyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal\n>>> \"not OK\"\"\"\n'not OK'\n```\nWhy doesn't Python give an error for the last statement, where the number of quotes does not match?"

        "content": "In Python, the use of single (`'`) and double (`\"`) quotes is interchangeable for defining string literals, but they need to be paired properly. However, when working with triple quotes (`'''` or `\"\"\"`), the rules are a bit different, which explains why your last example doesn't throw an error.\n\nLet's break down the behavior:\n\n1. **Single and Double Quotes**: When you open a string with a single or double quote, you must close it with the same type of quote. If you don't, Python will raise a `SyntaxError` because it reaches the end of the line (EOL) without finding a matching quote to close the string.\n\n    - Example: `\"not Ok'` results in a syntax error because the opening and closing quotes don't match.\n\n2. **Triple Quotes**: Triple quotes are used for multiline strings and allow for more flexibility. You can use triple quotes to span strings across multiple lines, and they are often used for docstrings. When you begin a string with triple quotes, it doesn't need to close until it finds three matching quotes of the same type.\n\n    - Example: `\"not OK\"\"\"` is actually valid in Python. Here's what happens:\n        - The opening `\"` starts a string.\n        - The text within the quotes (`not OK`) is considered the string content.\n        - The `\"\"\"` at the end is interpreted as the closing triple quotes, ending the string.\n\nIn the last example, Python interprets the single `\"` as the start of a string, and the following `\"\"\"` as the end of the string. There's no error because the string is properly closed with the triple quotes. However, this is not a common or recommended practice because it can lead to confusion. It's always best to ensure quotes are matched properly to maintain clarity in your code."
