Currently, the tkinter window starts as hidden and only becomes visible when I click on its icon on the dock. I'm using `Tkinter` and `PyObjC` with the `py2app` program."

        "content": "To make a Tkinter window appear on top of all other windows in Python 2, you can use the `topmost` attribute of the Tkinter window. However, since you are using `PyObjC` and `py2app` on macOS, you might need to ensure that the window is activated properly to appear in front. Here's a way to achieve this:\n\n1. Use the `attributes` method of the Tkinter window to set it as topmost.\n2. Use `PyObjC` to ensure that the application is activated and the window is brought to the front.\n\nHere's an example of how you can do this:\n\n```python\nimport Tkinter as tk\nimport objc\nfrom AppKit import NSApplication, NSApp, NSWindow\n\ndef bring_window_to_front():\n    # Activate the app\n    NSApp.activateIgnoringOtherApps_(True)\n    \n    # Get the main window and bring it to the front\n    window = NSApp.mainWindow()\n    if window:\n        window.makeKeyAndOrderFront_(None)\n\napp = tk.Tk()\n\n# Set the Tkinter window to be always on top\napp.attributes('-topmost', 1)\n\n# Call the function to bring the window to the front using PyObjC\napp.after(0, bring_window_to_front)\n\n# Set up your Tkinter window content\napp.title(\"My Tkinter App\")\nlabel = tk.Label(app, text=\"Hello, World!\")\nlabel.pack(padx=20, pady=20)\n\napp.mainloop()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`app.attributes('-topmost', 1)`**: This sets the Tkinter window to be always on top.\n- **`NSApp.activateIgnoringOtherApps_(True)`**: This ensures the application is activated and brought to the front on macOS.\n- **`window.makeKeyAndOrderFront_(None)`**: This brings the window to the front and makes it the key window.\n\nBy using this approach, your Tkinter window should start on top of all other windows when the application launches. Make sure you have the `PyObjC` library installed to use the Cocoa APIs."
