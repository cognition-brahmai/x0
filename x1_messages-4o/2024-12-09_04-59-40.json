I have successfully installed the latest version of sqlite3 via 'easy_install', which is confirmed by 'sqlite3.version_info' outputting '3.6.13'. However, when running my code, I receive an error: 'AttributeError: 'sqlite3.Connection' object has no attribute 'enable_load_extension''. I suspect that Python is still using the native sqlite3 module, which appears to be version '2.4.1' based on the output of 'sqlite3.version'. How can I ensure that Python uses the updated sqlite3 module for all sqlite3 calls?"

        "content": "To ensure that Python uses the latest version of SQLite that you have installed, you need to configure your environment so that the `sqlite3` module can find and use the updated SQLite libraries. Here are some steps you can follow:\n\n1. **Verify Installation**: First, make sure that the latest version of SQLite is installed on your system. You can check this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\n\n   ```bash\n   sqlite3 --version\n   ```\n\n   This should return the version number of the SQLite installation you want to use.\n\n2. **Locate SQLite Libraries**: Find the location where the updated SQLite libraries (`libsqlite3.so`, `libsqlite3.dylib`, or `sqlite3.dll`, depending on your OS) are installed. This is often in directories like `/usr/local/lib`, `/usr/lib`, or similar.\n\n3. **Set Environment Variables**: You may need to set environment variables so that Python uses the updated SQLite libraries. For Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS), you can set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (or `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` on macOS) environment variable to point to the directory containing your updated SQLite library:\n\n   ```bash\n   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/your/sqlite/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n   ```\n\n   For Windows, you may need to add the directory containing `sqlite3.dll` to your `PATH` environment variable.\n\n4. **Recompile Python (if necessary)**: If Python was compiled with a specific version of SQLite built-in, you might need to recompile Python to link it against the updated SQLite library. This requires downloading the Python source code, setting the library path, and recompiling:\n\n   ```bash\n   ./configure --enable-loadable-sqlite-extensions\n   make\n   sudo make install\n   ```\n\n   Make sure to pass the correct library path using `--with-sqlite3=/path/to/your/sqlite`.\n\n5. **Check Python's sqlite3 Module**: After setting the environment variables or recompiling Python, you can verify the SQLite version being used by Python's `sqlite3` module:\n\n   ```python\n   import sqlite3\n   print(sqlite3.sqlite_version)  # This should match the version of your installed SQLite\n   ```\n\n6. **Alternative Python Environment**: If recompiling is not feasible, consider using a Python environment manager like `pyenv` or `conda`, which might provide a more flexible way to manage Python installations and their dependencies.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to force Python to use the latest installed version of SQLite."
