My initial approach was like the following:\n\n```python\nclass Foo(object):\n    def _get_age(self):\n        return 11\n\n    age = property(_get_age)\n\n\nclass Bar(Foo):\n    def _get_age(self):\n        return 44\n```\nHowever, this didn't work as expected as the subclass `bar.age` still returned `11`, instead of `44` which I intended. I managed to find a workaround using a lambda expression:\n\n```python\nage = property(lambda self: self._get_age())\n```\nI am wondering if this is the correct solution for using properties and overwriting them in a subclass, or are there other preferred ways to do this?"

        "content": "Your initial approach with the `property` in the base class didn't work as expected because the `property` object is created at the class level, and it binds to the `Foo._get_age` method, not allowing the override in the subclass `Bar` to take effect automatically.\n\nYour workaround using a lambda expression is indeed a valid and common technique to ensure that the property calls the overridden method in the subclass. Here's why it works: the lambda expression defers the method lookup to runtime, which allows the subclass to override the method.\n\nHowever, there's an even more Pythonic way to handle this using the `@property` decorator, which is often clearer and more idiomatic in modern Python. Here's how you can rewrite your classes using the `@property` decorator:\n\n```python\nclass Foo(object):\n    @property\n    def age(self):\n        return 11\n\nclass Bar(Foo):\n    @property\n    def age(self):\n        return 44\n```\n\nThis approach is cleaner and leverages Python's property decorator, which is designed for exactly this kind of use case. The `@property` decorator automatically handles the method binding, ensuring that `Bar.age` correctly returns `44` when accessed. This way, you don't need to manage the creation of property objects manually, and the intent is clear and concise."
