However, I'm wondering if it's better to create each class in its own .py file, like I would do in C#. For instance, in C#, I would have one class for handling all database interactions and another class for managing business rules. Should I follow a similar approach in Python?"

        "content": "In Python, organizing your code into separate files and modules can help improve readability, maintainability, and reusability, much like in C#. However, whether you should create each class in its own `.py` file depends on the complexity of your project and personal or team preferences. Here are some considerations to help you decide:\n\n1. **Project Size and Complexity**: \n   - For small projects or scripts, it's common to have multiple classes in a single file.\n   - For larger projects, separating classes into individual files can make your codebase easier to navigate and maintain.\n\n2. **Separation of Concerns**:\n   - Keeping related classes together in a single file can make sense if they are tightly coupled or logically belong together.\n   - If classes have distinct responsibilities, such as handling database interactions and managing business logic, separating them can enforce a clean separation of concerns.\n\n3. **Reusability**:\n   - If a class is intended to be reused across different parts of your project or in different projects, placing it in its own file or module can facilitate this.\n\n4. **Team Collaboration**:\n   - In a team setting, having classes in separate files can help multiple developers work on different parts of the codebase simultaneously without causing merge conflicts.\n\n5. **Python Modules**:\n   - Python allows you to organize files into modules and packages. You can create a directory with an `__init__.py` file to form a package and then place related class files within this package.\n\n6. **Example Structure**:\n   - For a project with a database handler and business logic, you might have a directory structure like this:\n     ```\n     my_project/\n     \u251c\u2500\u2500 database/\n     \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n     \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 db_handler.py\n     \u251c\u2500\u2500 business_logic/\n     \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n     \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 rules_manager.py\n     \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.py\n     ```\n\nUltimately, the choice depends on your specific use case and what makes sense for your project's architecture. It's often a balance between organization and simplicity. As your project grows, you can refactor and reorganize your codebase to better suit your needs."
