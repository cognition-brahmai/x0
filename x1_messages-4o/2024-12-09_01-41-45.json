        "content": "It sounds like Homebrew may not have been installed correctly on your macOS system. Let's go through the steps to properly install Homebrew and ensure it's set up correctly:\n\n1. **Install Homebrew:**\n   First, you need to install Homebrew using the official installation command. Open Terminal and run the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n   ```\n\n   This script will download and install Homebrew in your system.\n\n2. **Verify Installation:**\n   Once the installation is complete, you should follow any instructions provided by the installer. It often suggests adding Homebrew to your PATH. You can verify that Homebrew is installed by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew --version\n   ```\n\n   If this command returns the version number, then Homebrew is installed correctly.\n\n3. **Update Your Shell Configuration:**\n   If you didn't do it during the installation process, you might need to add Homebrew to your PATH manually. Depending on your shell, you can do this by editing the appropriate configuration file:\n\n   For Bash, edit `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc`:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH\"\n   ```\n\n   For Zsh (default on macOS Catalina and later), edit `~/.zshrc`:\n\n   ```zsh\n   export PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH\"\n   ```\n\n   After editing the file, apply the changes with:\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bash_profile   # for Bash\n   source ~/.zshrc          # for Zsh\n   ```\n\n4. **Install Software using Homebrew:**\n   Now you should be able to install packages using Homebrew. To install `wget`, use:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew install wget\n   ```\n\n5. **Check for Errors:**\n   If you still encounter issues, check the terminal output for any error messages during installation and ensure you have the necessary permissions. Sometimes, running the installation command with `sudo` can solve permission-related issues, but generally, Homebrew doesn't require `sudo`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to install Homebrew and use it to install packages like `wget`. If you encounter any specific error messages, feel free to provide them for more detailed troubleshooting."
