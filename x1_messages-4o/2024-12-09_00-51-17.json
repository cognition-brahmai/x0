        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to changes in the Scikit-learn library. In versions of Scikit-learn after 0.18, the `cross_validation` module has been deprecated and its functionalities have been moved to the `model_selection` module.\n\nHere's how you can update your code to fix the ImportError:\n\n1. Replace the import statement for `cross_validation` with `model_selection`.\n2. Update any method calls that were using `cross_validation` to the corresponding `model_selection` methods.\n\nHere is the updated code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport sklearn\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import SelectFromModel\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import ExtraTreesClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n\n# Now you can use cross_val_score as needed\n```\n\nMake sure you update any other parts of your code where `cross_validation` was being used. For example, if you were using `cross_validation.train_test_split`, it should now be `model_selection.train_test_split`, which you've already done correctly.\n\nBy using `cross_val_score` from the `model_selection` module, your code should continue to work with the latest version of Scikit-learn."
