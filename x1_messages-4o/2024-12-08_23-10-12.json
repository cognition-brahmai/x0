        "content": "To solve these problems, we'll first calculate the volume and surface area of the sphere, and then determine the area of a hemisphere.\n\n### Step 1: Volume of the Sphere\n\nThe formula for the volume of a sphere is:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 \\]\n\nGiven that the radius \\( r \\) is 7 cm, we can substitute this value into the formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (7)^3 \\]\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\times 343 \\]\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{1372}{3} \\pi \\]\n\n\\[ V \\approx 1436.76 \\, \\text{cm}^3 \\]\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere is approximately 1436.76 cm\u00b3.\n\n### Step 2: Surface Area of the Sphere\n\nThe formula for the surface area of a sphere is:\n\n\\[ A = 4 \\pi r^2 \\]\n\nSubstituting the radius:\n\n\\[ A = 4 \\pi (7)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ A = 4 \\pi \\times 49 \\]\n\n\\[ A = 196 \\pi \\]\n\n\\[ A \\approx 615.75 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\]\n\nSo, the surface area of the sphere is approximately 615.75 cm\u00b2.\n\n### Step 3: Area of a Hemisphere with Curved Surface Area Equal to the Sphere's Surface Area\n\nThe curved surface area of a hemisphere is half of the surface area of a sphere, which is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Curved Surface Area of Hemisphere} = 2 \\pi r^2 \\]\n\nIf this is equal to the surface area of the given sphere, then:\n\n\\[ 2 \\pi r^2 = 196 \\pi \\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\( \\pi \\):\n\n\\[ 2 r^2 = 196 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ r^2 = 98 \\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\n\n\\[ r = \\sqrt{98} \\]\n\nSo the radius of the hemisphere is \\(\\sqrt{98}\\).\n\nThe total surface area of the hemisphere includes the curved surface area plus the base circle area:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Surface Area of Hemisphere} = 2 \\pi r^2 + \\pi r^2 \\]\n\n\\[ = 3 \\pi r^2 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( r = \\sqrt{98} \\), we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Surface Area of Hemisphere} = 3 \\pi (\\sqrt{98})^2 \\]\n\n\\[ = 3 \\pi \\times 98 \\]\n\n\\[ = 294 \\pi \\]\n\nTherefore, the total surface area of the hemisphere is \\(294 \\pi\\) cm\u00b2, and numerically approximately 923.25 cm\u00b2."
