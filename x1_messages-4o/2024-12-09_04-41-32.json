Here is my code:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, date, timedelta\n\na = [date.today(), date.today() + timedelta(days=1), date.today() - timedelta(days=1)]\nprint(a)  # prints '[datetime.date(2013, 1, 22), datetime.date(2013, 1, 23), datetime.date(2013, 1, 21)]'\na = a.sort()\nprint(a)  # prints 'None'....what???\n```\nThe output of 'a' after sorting is 'None', which is not what I expected. How can I fix this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that the `sort()` method sorts the list in place and does not return a new sorted list; instead, it returns `None`. To sort your list of `date` or `datetime` objects, you can use the `sort()` method correctly or use the `sorted()` function, which returns a new sorted list.\n\nHere's how you can fix your code:\n\n1. **Using `sort()` method:**\n\n   If you want to sort the list in place, you should call `sort()` without assigning it back to `a`.\n\n   ```python\n   from datetime import datetime, date, timedelta\n\n   a = [date.today(), date.today() + timedelta(days=1), date.today() - timedelta(days=1)]\n   print(a)  # prints the unsorted list\n   a.sort()  # sorts the list in place\n   print(a)  # now prints the sorted list\n   ```\n\n2. **Using `sorted()` function:**\n\n   If you want to keep the original list unchanged and create a new sorted list, you can use the `sorted()` function.\n\n   ```python\n   from datetime import datetime, date, timedelta\n\n   a = [date.today(), date.today() + timedelta(days=1), date.today() - timedelta(days=1)]\n   print(a)  # prints the unsorted list\n   sorted_a = sorted(a)  # creates a new sorted list\n   print(sorted_a)  # prints the sorted list\n   ```\n\nBoth approaches will sort your list of date objects correctly. If you're working with `datetime` objects, the same methods will work because the `datetime` module's `date` and `datetime` objects are inherently comparable."
