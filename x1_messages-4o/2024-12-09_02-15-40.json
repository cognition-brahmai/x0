        "content": "The error message \"IndexError: too many indices for array\" usually indicates that there's a mismatch in the dimensions of the data you are trying to access. In your code, it seems like the issue might be related to how you are slicing the `yTrain` data.\n\nIn your code, you used `train.iloc[:,54:]` for `yTrain`. This will create a DataFrame with all columns starting from index 54 onward, which could potentially include more than one column if your dataset has additional columns beyond the 54th index. Since you are using logistic regression, you generally want `yTrain` to be a one-dimensional array (a Series) representing the labels.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to extract `yTrain` correctly:\n\n```python\nimport pandas\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n\ntrain = pandas.read_csv(\"D:/...input/train.csv\")\n\n# Assuming the 54th column is the target column\nxTrain = train.iloc[:, 0:54]\nyTrain = train.iloc[:, 54]  # Use .iloc[:, 54] to get a single column as a Series\n\nclf = LogisticRegression(multi_class='multinomial', solver='lbfgs', max_iter=1000)\nscores = cross_val_score(clf, xTrain, yTrain, cv=10, scoring='accuracy')\n\nprint('****Results****')\nprint(scores.mean())\n```\n\n### Key Modifications:\n1. **`yTrain` Indexing**: Changed `train.iloc[:, 54:]` to `train.iloc[:, 54]` to ensure that you are selecting a single column, resulting in a one-dimensional Series.\n\n2. **Import Statement**: Updated `cross_validation` to `model_selection` since `cross_validation` is deprecated. Make sure your scikit-learn library is up to date.\n\n3. **Logistic Regression Parameters**: Added `solver='lbfgs'` and `max_iter=1000` to ensure convergence, especially when using multinomial logistic regression.\n\nMake sure that the 54th index is indeed the target column. If your dataset structure is different, you might need to adjust the indices accordingly."
