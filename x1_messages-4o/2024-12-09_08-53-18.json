        "content": "Certainly! Here's a simple C program that calculates and prints the Fibonacci number at a given index using an iterative approach:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n// Function to calculate the Fibonacci number at a given index\nunsigned long long fibonacci(int n) {\n    if (n == 0) return 0;\n    if (n == 1) return 1;\n\n    unsigned long long a = 0, b = 1, fib;\n    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\n        fib = a + b;\n        a = b;\n        b = fib;\n    }\n    return fib;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int index;\n    printf(\"Enter the index of the Fibonacci number: \");\n    scanf(\"%d\", &index);\n\n    if (index < 0) {\n        printf(\"Index cannot be negative.\\n\");\n    } else {\n        unsigned long long result = fibonacci(index);\n        printf(\"Fibonacci number at index %d is %llu\\n\", index, result);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### How the Program Works:\n1. **Function `fibonacci(int n)`:** This function calculates the Fibonacci number at index `n` using an iterative method. It handles the base cases where `n` is 0 or 1.\n2. **Iterative Calculation:** The function uses two variables, `a` and `b`, to store the last two Fibonacci numbers and iteratively calculates the next number in the sequence until it reaches the required index.\n3. **Input and Output:** In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter an index. The program then calculates the Fibonacci number at that index and prints it.\n\nThis program efficiently handles large indices due to its iterative nature, avoiding the pitfalls of recursive solutions like stack overflow for large inputs."
