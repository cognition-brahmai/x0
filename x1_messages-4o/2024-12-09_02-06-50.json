In the process of implementation, I realized that in order to subscribe, I would need to pass a callback to the function that will be called on fire. If the calling function was a class method, I could have used self. However, in the absence of this, how could I directly get a callback that can be useful for the `self.callbacks.append(callback)` part in the following code?\n\n```python\nclass Event(object):\n    pass\n\nclass Observable(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.callbacks = []\n    def subscribe(self, callback):\n        self.callbacks.append(callback)\n    def fire(self, **attrs):\n        e = Event()\n        e.source = self\n        for k, v in attrs.iteritems():\n            setattr(e, k, v)\n        for fn in self.callbacks:\n            fn(e)\n```"

        "content": "In your implementation of the Observer pattern, you're correct that you need to provide a callback function to the `subscribe` method. This callback is what will be called when the `fire` event is triggered. If you want to use a function as a callback that is not a method of a class instance (i.e., doesn't use `self`), you can define a standalone function or a lambda function.\n\nHere's how you can implement it using a standalone function:\n\n```python\nclass Event(object):\n    pass\n\nclass Observable(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.callbacks = []\n    def subscribe(self, callback):\n        self.callbacks.append(callback)\n    def fire(self, **attrs):\n        e = Event()\n        e.source = self\n        for k, v in attrs.items():  # Use `items()` instead of `iteritems()` for Python 3\n            setattr(e, k, v)\n        for fn in self.callbacks:\n            fn(e)\n\n# Define a standalone function\ndef my_callback(event):\n    print(f\"Event received from {event.source} with attributes {event.__dict__}\")\n\n# Usage\nobservable = Observable()\nobservable.subscribe(my_callback)\nobservable.fire(attribute1='value1', attribute2='value2')\n```\n\nIn this example, `my_callback` is a standalone function that takes an `event` as an argument and processes it. You can subscribe this function to the `Observable` instance. When `fire` is called, `my_callback` will be executed, and it will print the event's attributes.\n\nIf you want to use a lambda function, you can do it like this:\n\n```python\n# Usage with a lambda function\nobservable = Observable()\nobservable.subscribe(lambda e: print(f\"Lambda Event from {e.source} with {e.__dict__}\"))\nobservable.fire(attribute1='value1', attribute2='value2')\n```\n\nThe lambda function here does the same thing as `my_callback`, but it's defined inline at the point of subscription. This gives you a concise way to handle events without defining a separate function."
