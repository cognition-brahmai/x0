Your task is to find the number that contains the digit \"3\" in the tens place and the digit \"5\" in the ones place. However, there are two catches: \n1. You cannot simply search for \"35\" in the list. You must use positional notation and base-10 system to determine the location and meaning of each digit in the numbers.\n2. You only have 5 attempts to find the correct number. Each time you guess a number, you will receive feedback in the form of a \"hint\" that tells you how many digits are in the correct position.\nGood luck!"
