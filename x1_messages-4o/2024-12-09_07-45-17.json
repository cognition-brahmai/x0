However, the image appears smaller than the scatter plot as shown in the following code:\n```\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\nimage = np.random.randint(100,200,(200,200))\nx = np.arange(0,10,0.1)\ny = np.sin(x)\n\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2)\nax1.imshow(image)\nax2.scatter(x,y)\n\nplt.show()\n```\nThe result is shown [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/zkHti.png). I have attempted to use gridspec and manually adjust the subplot sizes but these methods have not worked. Is there a way to make imshow and a scatter plot appear the same size in a figure without manually changing the axes sizes? I am using Python 2.7 and matplotlib 2.0.0."

        "content": "To ensure that the `imshow` and `scatter` plots appear the same size in your figure, you can make use of `aspect` and `adjustable` properties in Matplotlib. By setting the aspect ratio of the axes to be equal and allowing the axes to accommodate the data limits, you can make the plots appear more uniform.\n\nHere's a modified version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Sample image data\nimage = np.random.randint(100, 200, (200, 200))\n\n# Sample scatter plot data\nx = np.arange(0, 10, 0.1)\ny = np.sin(x)\n\n# Create figure and axes\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2)\n\n# Plot the image and the scatter plot\nax1.imshow(image, aspect='auto')\nax2.scatter(x, y)\n\n# Set the aspect of the scatter plot to be equal\nax2.set_aspect('equal', adjustable='datalim')\n\n# Adjust the layout to make the plots appear more uniform\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this version:\n\n1. The `aspect='auto'` ensures that the image is stretched to fit the subplot.\n2. The `ax2.set_aspect('equal', adjustable='datalim')` makes sure that the scatter plot has equal aspect ratio and adjusts to data limits, balancing the size with respect to `ax1`.\n3. `plt.tight_layout()` helps in adjusting the subplots to minimize overlaps and improve layout appearance.\n\nThis should help in making the `imshow` and `scatter` plots appear more uniformly sized."
