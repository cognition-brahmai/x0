I have input data in the following format:\n\n```\ncategory   text\n1   hello iam fine. how are you\n1   iam good. how are you doing.\n```\n\nI read this data into a pandas dataframe using the following code:\n\n```\ninputData= pd.read_csv('Input', sep='\\t', names=['category','text'])\nX = inputData[\"text\"]\nY = inputData[\"category\"]\n```\n\nHere, Y is a pandas Series object containing the 'category' column. I want to convert this pandas series into a numpy array. I tried using the `.as_matrix` method like this:\n\n```\nYArray= Y.as_matrix(columns=None)\nprint(YArray)\n```\n\nBut the output I get is `[1,1]`, which is not what I expected as I have only one column 'category' and two rows in my data. I want the result as a 2x1 matrix. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To convert a pandas Series into a 2D numpy array (2x1 matrix), you can use the `.values` attribute and reshape the array. The `.as_matrix()` method has been deprecated in favor of `.values` or `.to_numpy()`. Here\u2019s how you can achieve the desired result:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming you've already read the data into a DataFrame\ninputData = pd.read_csv('Input', sep='\\t', names=['category', 'text'])\nY = inputData[\"category\"]\n\n# Convert the Series to a 2D numpy array (2x1 matrix)\nYArray = Y.values.reshape(-1, 1)\nprint(YArray)\n```\n\nIn this code, `Y.values` gives you the underlying numpy array for the Series, and `reshape(-1, 1)` reshapes it into a 2D array with as many rows as needed (inferred by `-1`) and 1 column. This will give you the expected output as a 2x1 matrix:\n\n```\n[[1]\n [1]]\n```"
