I also have a list, `myList = [\"Toronto Maple Leafs\", \"New York Rangers\"]`. I want to use the `endswith()` method to write an if statement that checks to see if `myStr` ends with either of the strings in `myList`. I have the basic if statement, but I am not sure what to put in the parentheses to check this. Here's what I have so far:\n\n```python\nif myStr.endswith():\n    print(\"Success\")\n```\nHow can I use the `endswith()` function to check if `myStr` ends with any of the strings in `myList`?"

Here's how you can modify your if statement:\n\n```python\nmyStr = \"Chicago Blackhawks vs. New York Rangers\"\nmyList = [\"Toronto Maple Leafs\", \"New York Rangers\"]\n\nif myStr.endswith(tuple(myList)):\n    print(\"Success\")\n```\n\nIn this code, `tuple(myList)` converts the list `myList` into a tuple, which can then be passed to the `endswith()` method to check if `myStr` ends with any of the strings in the tuple. If `myStr` ends with any of the specified strings, the condition evaluates to `True`, and \"Success\" will be printed."
