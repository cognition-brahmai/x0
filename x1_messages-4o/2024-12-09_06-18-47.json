How can I set the \"python\" environment in the Windows environment variable to point to either Python 3.3 or 2.7? Is there an easy way to switch between the two versions from the command line?"

        "content": "To switch between Python 2.7 and Python 3.3 from the command line on Windows, you can use a few different methods. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n### Method 1: Using Environment Variables\n\n1. **Install Both Versions**: Ensure both Python 2.7 and Python 3.3 are installed on your system. Typically, they are installed in directories like `C:\\Python27` and `C:\\Python33`.\n\n2. **Modify Environment Variables**:\n   - Open the System Properties dialog by right-clicking on \"This PC\" or \"My Computer\" and selecting \"Properties\".\n   - Click on \"Advanced system settings\" and then the \"Environment Variables\" button.\n   - Find the `Path` variable in the \"System variables\" section and click \"Edit\".\n   - You can add paths to both Python installations. For example:\n     - `C:\\Python27;C:\\Python27\\Scripts;`\n     - `C:\\Python33;C:\\Python33\\Scripts;`\n\n3. **Switching Versions**:\n   - To switch between versions, you can temporarily modify the `Path` variable directly in the command line.\n   - Open Command Prompt and use the following command to prepend the desired Python version path:\n     - For Python 2.7: \n       ```cmd\n       set PATH=C:\\Python27;C:\\Python27\\Scripts;%PATH%\n       ```\n     - For Python 3.3: \n       ```cmd\n       set PATH=C:\\Python33;C:\\Python33\\Scripts;%PATH%\n       ```\n\n4. **Verify the Version**: Check which version is currently active by running:\n   ```cmd\n   python --version\n   ```\n\n### Method 2: Using Python Launcher\n\nWindows also provides a Python launcher (`py`) that helps in managing multiple Python versions.\n\n1. **Install Python Launcher**: It often comes with Python installations by default.\n\n2. **Using Launcher**:\n   - To run a script with Python 2.7:\n     ```cmd\n     py -2 ex1.py\n     ```\n   - To run a script with Python 3.3:\n     ```cmd\n     py -3.3 ex1.py\n     ```\n\n3. **Set Default Version**: You can configure the default version by editing the `py.ini` file which is usually located in your user directory (e.g., `C:\\Users\\<YourUsername>`).\n\n### Method 3: Using Batch Files\n\n1. **Create Batch Files**: Create simple batch files to switch between versions.\n\n2. **Batch File for Python 2.7**:\n   - Create a file named `use_python27.bat` with the following content:\n     ```cmd\n     @echo off\n     set PATH=C:\\Python27;C:\\Python27\\Scripts;%PATH%\n     echo Switched to Python 2.7\n     ```\n\n3. **Batch File for Python 3.3**:\n   - Create a file named `use_python33.bat` with the following content:\n     ```cmd\n     @echo off\n     set PATH=C:\\Python33;C:\\Python33\\Scripts;%PATH%\n     echo Switched to Python 3.3\n     ```\n\n4. **Run the Batch File**: To switch Python versions, run the respective batch file in your command prompt.\n\nEach of these methods provides a way to switch between Python versions, allowing you to work with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.3 as needed."
