Once you find the dictionary containing the key `'d'`, you can retrieve its value. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nlist_of_dicts = [{'a': 1, 'b': 2}, {'c': 3, 'd': 4}, {'e': 5, 'f': 6}]\n\n# Iterate over the list\nfor dictionary in list_of_dicts:\n    # Check if 'd' is a key in the current dictionary\n    if 'd' in dictionary:\n        # Access the value for the key 'd'\n        value = dictionary['d']\n        print(value)\n        break  # Exit the loop once the key is found\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you know the position of the dictionary containing the key `'d'`, you can directly access it using the index:\n\n```python\nvalue = list_of_dicts[1]['d']  # Access the second dictionary and get the value for 'd'\nprint(value)\n```\n\nBoth methods will output `4`, which is the value associated with the key `'d'`."
