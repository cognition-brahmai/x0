        "content": "Is there a way to preserve Python tuples when encoding with JSON? When I use `json.loads(json.dumps(tuple))`, I get a list back instead of a tuple. I need to maintain my data structures as tuples and not convert them into lists for my application which involves multi-dimensional arrays of varying shapes. I have some class methods that use recursion to probe these arrays and convert the endpoints into a string or integer. I've found that using tuples can prevent deeper recursive searching of arrays. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "When you serialize a Python tuple to JSON using `json.dumps`, it gets converted to a JSON array, which is then deserialized back into a Python list when you use `json.loads`. This happens because JSON does not have a native representation for tuples; it only has arrays, which map to Python lists.\n\nTo preserve tuples during the JSON serialization/deserialization process, you can create a custom encoder and decoder. Here's one way to do it:\n\n1. **Custom JSON Encoder**: Convert tuples to a specific JSON-serializable format, such as a dictionary with a specific key indicating that it's a tuple.\n\n2. **Custom JSON Decoder**: Recognize this format and convert it back to a tuple.\n\nHere's an example of how you could implement this:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Custom JSON encoder that converts tuples to a format that can be recognized later\nclass TupleEncoder(json.JSONEncoder):\n    def default(self, obj):\n        if isinstance(obj, tuple):\n            return {'__tuple__': True, 'items': list(obj)}\n        return super().default(obj)\n\n# Custom JSON decoder that converts the special format back to tuples\ndef tuple_decoder(dct):\n    if '__tuple__' in dct:\n        return tuple(dct['items'])\n    return dct\n\n# Example usage\ndata = (1, 2, (3, 4), (5, (6, 7)))\n\n# Serialize with custom encoder\njson_data = json.dumps(data, cls=TupleEncoder)\nprint('Serialized JSON:', json_data)\n\n# Deserialize with custom decoder\noriginal_data = json.loads(json_data, object_hook=tuple_decoder)\nprint('Deserialized Data:', original_data)\n```\n\nThis will correctly serialize tuples as a special dictionary format and deserialize them back into tuples. The key `__tuple__` is used to identify the dictionaries that represent tuples, and `items` holds the list of the tuple's elements. This approach helps in maintaining the tuple structure through the JSON serialization and deserialization process."
