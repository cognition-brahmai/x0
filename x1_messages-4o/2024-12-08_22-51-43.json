        "content": "Certainly! The R code provided is already set up to list the planets in the Solar System according to their distance from the Sun, starting from the closest. Here's an explanation of how the code works:\n\n```r\n# Create a data frame with planet names and their corresponding distances from the Sun\nplanet_distances <- data.frame(\n    planet = c(\"Mercury\", \"Venus\", \"Earth\", \"Mars\", \"Jupiter\", \"Saturn\", \"Uranus\", \"Neptune\"),\n    distance = c(0.39, 0.72, 1.00, 1.52, 5.20, 9.58, 19.18, 30.07)\n)\n\n# Order the planets based on their distance from the Sun\nordered_planets <- planet_distances[order(planet_distances$distance),]\n\n# Print the names of the planets in the order of their distance from the Sun\nprint(ordered_planets$planet)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- A data frame named `planet_distances` is created with two columns: `planet` for the planet names and `distance` for their respective distances from the Sun in astronomical units (AU).\n- The `order` function is used to sort the data frame by the `distance` column.\n- The planets are printed in order of increasing distance from the Sun using `print(ordered_planets$planet)`.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output the names of the planets in the order of their proximity to the Sun:\n\n```\n[1] \"Mercury\" \"Venus\" \"Earth\" \"Mars\" \"Jupiter\" \"Saturn\" \"Uranus\" \"Neptune\"\n```\n\nThis output confirms that the planets are sorted accurately by their distance."
