        "content": "I'm attempting to use quantile in a loss function to train a model in Flux (Julia) for some robustness, similar to least trimmed squares. However, it seems to mutate the array and Zygote throws an error saying 'Mutating arrays is not supported', which is coming from the 'sort!' function. I've provided a simple example where I'm using Flux and StatsBase with the model being a chain of two Dense layers. I'm using Flux 0.10 with Julia 1.2. How can I fix this error and make my code work as intended?\n\n```julia\nusing Flux, StatsBase\nxdata = randn(2, 100)   \nydata = randn(100)\n\nmodel = Chain(Dense(2,10), Dense(10, 1))\n\nfunction trimmedLoss(x,y; trimFrac=0.f05)\n        yhat = model(x)\n        absRes = abs.(yhat .- y) |> vec\n        trimVal = quantile(absRes, 1.f0-trimFrac) \n        s = sum(ifelse.(absRes .> trimVal,  0.f0 , absRes ))/(length(absRes)*(1.f0-trimFrac))\nend\n\nprintln(trimmedLoss(xdata, ydata)) #works ok\n\nFlux.train!(trimmedLoss, params(model), zip([xdata], [ydata]), ADAM())\n\nprintln(trimmedLoss(xdata, ydata)) #changed loss?\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the use of the `quantile` function, which relies on sorting the array, and the `sort!` function mutates the array, which is not compatible with Zygote's automatic differentiation in Flux. To resolve this, you need to avoid mutating the array during the computation of the quantile.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use a non-mutating sorting function:\n\n```julia\nusing Flux, StatsBase, Zygote\n\nxdata = randn(2, 100)\nydata = randn(100)\n\nmodel = Chain(Dense(2, 10), Dense(10, 1))\n\nfunction trimmedLoss(x, y; trimFrac = 0.05)\n    yhat = model(x)\n    absRes = abs.(yhat .- y)\n    sortedRes = sort(absRes)  # Use the non-mutating sort\n    trimVal = quantile(sortedRes, 1.0 - trimFrac)\n    return sum(ifelse.(absRes .> trimVal, 0.0, absRes)) / (length(absRes) * (1.0 - trimFrac))\nend\n\n# Prepare the data as a tuple\ndata = [(xdata, ydata)]\n\n# Check the loss function\nprintln(trimmedLoss(xdata, ydata))  # Should work without errors\n\n# Train the model\nopt = ADAM()\nFlux.train!(trimmedLoss, params(model), data, opt)\n\n# Check the loss function again\nprintln(trimmedLoss(xdata, ydata))  # Should reflect the updated model\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Non-mutating Sort**: Replaced `sort!` with `sort`, which does not mutate the input array `absRes`.\n2. **Data Wrapping**: Wrapped `xdata` and `ydata` in a tuple for `train!`, which is expected by Flux.\n\nBy using the non-mutating `sort` function, you avoid the mutation error thrown by Zygote, making the loss function compatible with the automatic differentiation mechanism in Flux."
