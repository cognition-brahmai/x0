I have a script named \"test.py\" which only contains the code `print(\"Hello.\")` and it is located in the directory C:\\Python27. In my system variables, I have Python set to be C:\\Python27 as I have multiple versions of Python installed on my computer. I am trying to run the command `python test.py` in the command line, but I am getting a SyntaxError. The error message is as follows:\n\n```\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1\npython test.py\n       ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n```\n\nCan you explain what is going wrong?"
