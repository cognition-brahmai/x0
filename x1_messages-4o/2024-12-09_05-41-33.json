I used the following code:\n\n```python\nfig, axs = plt.subplots()\naxs[0, 0].boxplot([df1['x'], df2['x']])\nplt.show();\n```\nHowever, I encountered a TypeError which says: `'AxesSubplot' object is not subscriptable`. The error traceback is as follows:\n\n```python\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\n&lt;ipython-input-108-ce962754d553&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()\n----&gt; 2 axs[0, 0].boxplot([df1['x'], df2['x']])\n      3 plt.show();\n      4 \n\nTypeError: 'AxesSubplot' object is not subscriptable\n```\nCould anyone provide a solution to this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is because you're trying to index `axs` as if it were a 2D array, but since you only created a single subplot, `axs` is actually a single `AxesSubplot` object, not an array.\n\nHere's how you can fix the code to create a box plot with the variable `x` from the two dataframes `df1` and `df2`:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Assuming df1 and df2 are your dataframes and 'x' is the column you want to plot\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()  # Create a single subplot\nax.boxplot([df1['x'], df2['x']])  # Use ax instead of axs[0, 0]\nax.set_xticklabels(['df1', 'df2'])  # Set labels for x-ticks to differentiate the dataframes\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this corrected code:\n- `fig, ax = plt.subplots()` creates a single subplot, and `ax` is the `AxesSubplot` object.\n- You then use `ax.boxplot()` to plot the box plot.\n- The `ax.set_xticklabels()` is used to set the labels for the x-ticks, which will help differentiate which box plot corresponds to which dataframe.\n\nThis should resolve the `TypeError` and correctly display the box plots for your data."
