It involves analyzing the content of each document and creating a list of keywords or phrases that represent the most important topics or themes in the document. This index is then used to quickly locate documents that contain a particular keyword or phrase. The formula for indexing measures the percentage of documents that have been indexed out of the total number of documents in a collection."

        "content": "The concept of indexing, as you described, can be simplified using the given formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Indexing Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of Indexed Documents}}{\\text{Total Number of Documents}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nThis formula calculates the percentage of documents that have been indexed in a collection. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Number of Indexed Documents**: This is the count of documents that have been processed and have an index created for them. These documents can be quickly searched and retrieved based on keywords or phrases.\n\n2. **Total Number of Documents**: This is the total count of all documents in the collection, whether indexed or not.\n\n3. **Indexing Percentage**: By dividing the number of indexed documents by the total number of documents and multiplying by 100, you get the percentage of the collection that is indexed. This percentage gives an idea of how much of the data is readily searchable.\n\nIndexing is crucial because it significantly enhances the speed and efficiency of data retrieval, making it easier to find relevant information quickly."
