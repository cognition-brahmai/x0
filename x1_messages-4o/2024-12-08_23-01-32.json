        "content": "To modify the provided Swift code to allow users to add their own books to the library and search for books based on genre, you can add a method for adding books to the library and modify the `searchBooks` method to include genre-based searches. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```swift\nimport UIKit\n\nclass Book {\n    var title: String\n    var author: String\n    var genre: String\n    \n    init(title: String, author: String, genre: String) {\n        self.title = title\n        self.author = author\n        self.genre = genre\n    }\n}\n\nclass Library {\n    var books: [Book]\n    var readingList: [Book]\n    \n    init() {\n        self.books = []\n        self.readingList = []\n    }\n    \n    func searchBooks(keyword: String, searchByGenre: Bool = false) -> [Book] {\n        if searchByGenre {\n            return books.filter({ $0.genre.contains(keyword) })\n        } else {\n            return books.filter({ $0.title.contains(keyword) || $0.author.contains(keyword) })\n        }\n    }\n    \n    func addToReadingList(book: Book) {\n        readingList.append(book)\n    }\n    \n    func addBook(title: String, author: String, genre: String) {\n        let newBook = Book(title: title, author: author, genre: genre)\n        books.append(newBook)\n    }\n}\n\nlet myLibrary = Library()\n\n// Existing books\nlet book1 = Book(title: \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", author: \"Harper Lee\", genre: \"Classic\")\nlet book2 = Book(title: \"The Great Gatsby\", author: \"F. Scott Fitzgerald\", genre: \"Classic\")\nlet book3 = Book(title: \"1984\", author: \"George Orwell\", genre: \"Science Fiction\")\nmyLibrary.books = [book1, book2, book3]\n\n// Add a new book to the library\nmyLibrary.addBook(title: \"Brave New World\", author: \"Aldous Huxley\", genre: \"Science Fiction\")\n\n// Search for books based on a keyword in the title or author\nlet keyword = \"kill\"\nlet searchResults = myLibrary.searchBooks(keyword: keyword)\n\n// Search for books based on genre\nlet genreKeyword = \"Science Fiction\"\nlet genreSearchResults = myLibrary.searchBooks(keyword: genreKeyword, searchByGenre: true)\n\n// Add a book to the reading list\nif let bookToAdd = searchResults.first {\n    myLibrary.addToReadingList(book: bookToAdd)\n}\n\n// Print reading list\nprint(\"Reading List:\")\nfor book in myLibrary.readingList {\n    print(\"\\(book.title) by \\(book.author)\")\n}\n\n// Print books found by genre\nprint(\"\\nBooks in Genre '\\(genreKeyword)':\")\nfor book in genreSearchResults {\n    print(\"\\(book.title) by \\(book.author)\")\n}\n```\n\n### Key Changes Made:\n1. **Add Book Method**: Introduced a `addBook` method in the `Library` class to allow users to add new books by providing the title, author, and genre.\n2. **Search by Genre**: Modified the `searchBooks` method to allow searching by genre using an optional `searchByGenre` parameter.\n3. **Usage Examples**: Demonstrated how to add a new book and search by genre.\n\nThe code is structured to be flexible, allowing users to add books and perform various types of searches easily."
