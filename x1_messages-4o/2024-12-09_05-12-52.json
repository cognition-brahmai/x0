In my method, I have a local variable 'timeout' set to 300 seconds. I am unit testing this method using mock to simulate return values from foo(). However, I don't want the test to wait for the full 5 minutes to get the exception if the operation doesn't succeed. Is there a way to override this local 'timeout' value in my unittest, so that it's just a few seconds? I tried to override it using patch.object in my unittest but it raises an AttributeError. Here is my code:\n\n```python\ndef keep_trying(self):\n    timeout = 300  #empirically derived, appropriate timeout\n    end_time = time.time() + timeout\n    while (time.time() < end_time):\n        result = self.foo()\n        if (result == 'success'):\n            break\n        time.sleep(2)\n    else:\n        raise MyException('useful msg here')\n```\nUnsuccessful unittest:\n```python\n@patch.object(myClass.keep_trying, 'timeout')\n@patch.object(myClass, 'foo')\ndef test_keep_trying(self, mock_foo, mock_timeout):\n    mock_foo.return_value = 'failed'\n    mock_timeout.return_value = 10 # raises AttributeError\n    mock_timeout = 10 # raises AttributeError\n    ...\n```"

        "content": "To override the `timeout` value in your unit test, you need to understand that `timeout` is a local variable within the method `keep_trying`. It's not an attribute of the class or the method, so you can't directly patch it using `patch.object`. Instead, you can refactor your code to make it easier to test by passing `timeout` as an argument to the method. This way, you can control the `timeout` value during testing without changing the overall logic of your method. Here's how you can refactor the method and write the corresponding unit test:\n\n### Refactored Method:\n```python\ndef keep_trying(self, timeout=300):  # Add 'timeout' as an argument with a default value\n    end_time = time.time() + timeout\n    while (time.time() < end_time):\n        result = self.foo()\n        if (result == 'success'):\n            break\n        time.sleep(2)\n    else:\n        raise MyException('useful msg here')\n```\n\n### Updated Unit Test:\n```python\nfrom unittest import TestCase\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\n\nclass TestMyClass(TestCase):\n    @patch.object(myClass, 'foo')\n    def test_keep_trying(self, mock_foo):\n        mock_foo.return_value = 'failed'\n        \n        instance = myClass()\n        timeout_value = 10  # Set a shorter timeout for the test\n\n        with self.assertRaises(MyException):  # Expecting the exception to be raised\n            instance.keep_trying(timeout=timeout_value)  # Pass the shorter timeout\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Refactoring the Method**: By adding `timeout` as an argument to the method, you retain the flexibility to specify different timeout values when calling the method. The default value remains 300 seconds, which is used in normal operation.\n- **Testing with a Short Timeout**: In the test, you can now specify a shorter timeout value (e.g., 10 seconds). This allows you to quickly test the behavior of the method without waiting for the full 5 minutes.\n- **Mocking `foo`**: The `foo` method is mocked to always return `'failed'`, ensuring that the method will eventually raise `MyException` due to the timeout.\n\nThis approach allows you to test the timeout logic effectively without having to modify the core behavior of your method for production use."
