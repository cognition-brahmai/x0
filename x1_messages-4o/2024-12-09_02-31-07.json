        "content": "In IPython Notebook, the logging output might not appear directly in the notebook interface because the logging module by default sends logs to the standard error stream, which may not be captured by the notebook interface. To ensure that the log messages appear in the notebook, you can configure the logging to use a `StreamHandler` that writes to the standard output (`sys.stdout`), which is captured by the notebook interface.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport logging\nimport sys\n\n# Create a custom logger\nlogger = logging.getLogger()\n\n# Set the level of the logger. This can also be set to INFO or ERROR for fewer messages.\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\n# Create a handler that writes log messages to standard output\nhandler = logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)\n\n# Set the level of the handler\nhandler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\n# Create a formatter and set it for the handler\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nhandler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\n# Add the handler to the logger\nlogger.addHandler(handler)\n\n# Example logging message\nlogger.debug(\"test\")\n```\n\nThis code sets up a logger using a `StreamHandler` directed at `sys.stdout`, ensuring that log messages are displayed in the notebook. Adjust the logging level as needed (e.g., `logging.INFO`, `logging.WARNING`, etc.) to control the verbosity of the output."
