I tried dropping the old key and adding a new one, but I am facing an OperationalError. Here is the code I used:\n\n```python\nop.drop_constraint('PRIMARY', 'some_table', type_='primary')\nop.create_primary_key('PRIMARY', 'some_table', ['col1', 'col2'])\n```\n\nAnd, this is the error message I received:\n\n```python\nsqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (OperationalError) (1025, \"Error on rename of ... (errno: 150 - Foreign key constraint is incorrectly formed)\") 'ALTER TABLE some_table DROP PRIMARY KEY ' ()\n```\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is likely due to the presence of foreign key constraints that depend on the primary key you are trying to alter. When you attempt to drop the primary key, if there are foreign keys referencing it, SQL won't allow the operation unless those foreign keys are addressed first. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can handle this situation:\n\n1. **Identify Foreign Key Constraints**: Check if there are any foreign key constraints that reference the columns of the primary key you want to change. You might need to inspect your database schema to identify these constraints.\n\n2. **Drop Foreign Key Constraints**: Before altering the primary key, drop the foreign key constraints that depend on it. You can do this using `op.drop_constraint()` in Alembic for each foreign key constraint.\n\n3. **Drop the Primary Key**: Once the foreign key constraints are removed, you can safely drop the primary key using `op.drop_constraint()`.\n\n4. **Create the New Primary Key**: Add the new primary key using `op.create_primary_key()`.\n\n5. **Recreate Foreign Key Constraints**: Finally, recreate the foreign key constraints using `op.create_foreign_key()`.\n\nHere's an example of how you might structure your Alembic migration script:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Drop foreign key constraints\nop.drop_constraint('fk_some_table_col1', 'some_table', type_='foreignkey')\n# Repeat for other foreign keys as needed\n\n# Step 2: Drop the existing primary key\nop.drop_constraint('PRIMARY', 'some_table', type_='primary')\n\n# Step 3: Create the new primary key\nop.create_primary_key('PRIMARY', 'some_table', ['col1', 'col2'])\n\n# Step 4: Recreate foreign key constraints\nop.create_foreign_key('fk_some_table_col1', 'some_table', 'other_table', ['col1'], ['other_col1'])\n# Repeat for other foreign keys as needed\n```\n\n**Additional Tips**:\n- Make sure you have a backup of your database before performing these operations, as altering constraints can lead to data integrity issues if not done carefully.\n- Review your database schema to ensure all dependencies are addressed.\n- Use a transaction to ensure that all operations are atomic, meaning either all of them succeed, or none of them do, preserving the integrity of your database.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to alter the primary key without encountering the `OperationalError`."
