VSCode has detected and set the environment correctly as I see the \"python.pythonPath\" user setting is set appropriately. However, when I try to run a Python file using Ctrl+F5 in VS Code, I am always prompted to \"select environment\" and it offers me two options - Python and Python Experimental. Could you explain what \"Python Experimental\" is and how I can avoid this interruption every time I run a script?"

        "content": "In Visual Studio Code (VSCode), the prompt to \"select environment\" when you run a Python file typically appears because the editor needs to know which Python interpreter to use for executing your script. The options \"Python\" and \"Python Experimental\" are typically provided when there are different Python extensions or configurations available in your workspace.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of what these options might mean:\n\n1. **Python**: This is usually the standard Python interpreter you have installed on your system and configured in VSCode.\n\n2. **Python Experimental**: This might be a secondary Python environment or configuration. Sometimes, it can refer to an extension or feature that is still under development or testing. It may include additional features or settings that are not part of the standard Python interpreter.\n\nTo avoid this interruption every time you run a script, you can set a default interpreter in your workspace settings. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Open the Command Palette**: You can do this by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).\n\n2. **Select Interpreter**: Type `Python: Select Interpreter` in the Command Palette and select it.\n\n3. **Choose the Interpreter**: Choose the interpreter you want to set as default (likely the standard Python interpreter).\n\n4. **Save the Setting**: This should update your workspace settings to use the selected interpreter by default, avoiding the prompt every time you run a script.\n\nAdditionally, ensure that your `settings.json` for the workspace has the correct `python.pythonPath` set to the Python interpreter you wish to use.\n\nIf you continue to face the prompt, check if there are any other extensions or configurations causing a conflict and consider disabling or configuring them appropriately."
