I recently installed Python 3.6.1, and when I try to run the console (or anything with Python3), I encounter this error. The class IntFlag does exist within enum.py, so why is this AttributeError being thrown?\n\nStack Trace:\n```\nAttributeError: module 'enum' has no attribute 'IntFlag'\n\n$ /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin/python3  \nFailed to import the site module  \nTraceback (most recent call last):  \n  File \"/usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.6.1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site.py\", line 544, in <module>  \n    main()  \n  File \"/usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.6.1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site.py\", line 530, in main  \n    known_paths = addusersitepackages(known_paths)  \n  File \"/usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.6.1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site.py\", line 282, in addusersitepackages  \n    user_site = getusersitepackages()  \n  File \"/usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.6.1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site.py\", line 258, in getusersitepackages  \n    user_base = getuserbase() # this will also set USER_BASE  \n  File \"/usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.6.1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site.py\", line 248, in getuserbase  \n    USER_BASE = get_config_var('userbase')  \n  File \"/usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.6.1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/sysconfig.py\", line 601, in get_config_var  \n    return get_config_vars().get(name)  \n  File \"/usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.6.1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/sysconfig.py\", line 580, in get_config_vars  \n    import _osx_support  \n  File \"/usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.6.1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/_osx_support.py\", line 4, in <module>  \n    import re  \n  File \"/usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.6.1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/re.py\", line 142, in <module>  \n    class RegexFlag(enum.IntFlag):  \nAttributeError: module 'enum' has no attribute 'IntFlag'\n```"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The `AttributeError` you're encountering is likely due to a name conflict with the `enum` module. In Python, the `enum` module is standard and provides support for enumerations, including `IntFlag` which was introduced in Python 3.6. However, if there is a local file or a third-party package named `enum` in your environment, it can overshadow the standard library's `enum` module, leading to this error.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check for Local Files or Modules**: Look in your current directory and in your `PYTHONPATH` for any files named `enum.py` or directories named `enum`. Rename or remove them if they exist.\n\n2. **Check Installed Packages**: If you're using a virtual environment or have installed packages globally, there might be a package named `enum` installed that is conflicting with the standard library. You can check for this by running:\n   ```bash\n   pip list | grep enum\n   ```\n   If you see a package named `enum`, try uninstalling it:\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall enum\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify Python Path**: Ensure that the standard library path is correctly included in your Python path. You can check this by running the following in your Python shell:\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   print(sys.path)\n   ```\n   Make sure that the path to the standard library is present and prioritized over other paths.\n\n4. **Reinstall Python**: If the issue persists, consider reinstalling Python 3.6.1 to ensure that all standard library modules are correctly set up. Make sure to use the official installer from Python.org or a trusted package manager like Homebrew.\n\n5. **Update Python**: Since Python 3.6.1 is an older version, consider updating to a more recent Python 3.6.x release or newer, as they may include bug fixes and improvements. \n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `AttributeError` with the `enum.IntFlag`."
