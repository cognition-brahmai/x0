I have a list of integers such as numList = [1, 2, 3] and I want to convert this into a single integer like 123.

Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef magic(numList):\n    # Convert each integer in the list to a string and join them together\n    combined_str = ''.join(map(str, numList))\n    \n    # Convert the combined string back to an integer\n    result = int(combined_str)\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage\nnumList = [1, 2, 3]\nresult = magic(numList)\nprint(result)  # Output: 123\n```\n\nHere's what happens in the `magic` function:\n\n1. `map(str, numList)` converts each integer in the list to a string.\n2. `''.join(...)` concatenates these string representations together into a single string.\n3. `int(combined_str)` converts the concatenated string back into an integer.\n\nThis will give you the desired single integer representation of the list of integers."
