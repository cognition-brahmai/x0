Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using `str()`**: This will give you the raw HTML as a string, including all the tags and their contents.\n\n   ```python\n   from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n   # Assuming 'listing' is your BeautifulSoup Tag object\n   raw_html = str(listing)\n   print(raw_html)\n   ```\n\n2. **Using `.prettify()`**: This will return a formatted string of the HTML, which is more readable but includes additional whitespace for indentation.\n\n   ```python\n   from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n   # Assuming 'listing' is your BeautifulSoup Tag object\n   formatted_html = listing.prettify()\n   print(formatted_html)\n   ```\n\nBoth methods will give you the HTML content of the `listing` object as a string. If you want the raw HTML without any additional formatting, using `str()` is the way to go."
