        "content": "To stack two tensors of different shapes using `torch.stack`, you first need to make sure that the tensors have the same shape along the dimensions you want to stack. Since `a` has the shape `(2, 3, 4)` and `b` has the shape `(2, 3)`, you need to reshape or expand `b` to match `a` in certain dimensions.\n\nHere's one way to do it:\n\n1. Expand the dimensions of `b` to make it compatible with `a`. Since `b` has a shape of `(2, 3)`, you can add an extra dimension to make it `(2, 3, 1)`.\n\n2. Use `torch.stack` to stack these along a new dimension.\n\nHere's a sample code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\n# Define the tensors\na = torch.randn(2, 3, 4)\nb = torch.randn(2, 3)\n\n# Expand dimensions of b to match a\nb_expanded = b.unsqueeze(-1)  # This will make b's shape (2, 3, 1)\n\n# Stack a and b_expanded along a new dimension\nresult = torch.stack((a, b_expanded), dim=-1)\n\nprint(\"Result shape:\", result.shape)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `b.unsqueeze(-1)` is used to add an extra dimension, changing `b`'s shape from `(2, 3)` to `(2, 3, 1)`.\n- `torch.stack((a, b_expanded), dim=-1)` stacks `a` and `b_expanded` along the last dimension, resulting in a new tensor with shape `(2, 3, 5)`.\n\nThis way, both tensors are stacked without performing any in-place operations."
