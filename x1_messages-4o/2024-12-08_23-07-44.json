Additionally, I am only allowed to use the Mulliken analysis output to solve this puzzle. Can you provide step-by-step instructions on how to achieve this task? Remember, the chemical formula for sulfurous acid is [H2SO3] and the formula is H-O-S(=O)-O-H."

        "content": "To solve the chemical mystery using the command \"echo -e 'H2SO3\\n\\n' | mulliken -i -g -p\", you would be utilizing a tool that likely performs Mulliken population analysis, which is a method used in computational chemistry to assign charges to atoms within a molecule based on the electron density distribution. Although the specific tool or script named \"mulliken\" isn't a standard command-line utility, let's assume it provides data on the distribution of charges or other electronic properties of the provided molecule.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to achieving your task:\n\n1. **Set Up the Environment:**\n   - Ensure you have access to a terminal and the \"mulliken\" tool installed on your system.\n   - This command will take an input string representing a chemical formula and perform Mulliken analysis to provide insights into electronic properties.\n\n2. **Run the Command:**\n   - Execute the command in your shell:\n     ```bash\n     echo -e 'H2SO3\\n\\n' | mulliken -i -g -p\n     ```\n   - The `echo -e` command outputs the string `H2SO3\\n\\n` and pipes it into the `mulliken` tool. The `-i`, `-g`, and `-p` options are likely flags for specific analysis modes or outputs. Check the documentation for your specific tool to understand each flag's purpose.\n\n3. **Analyze the Output:**\n   - The Mulliken analysis should provide you with data on the distribution of electron density among the atoms in H2SO3.\n   - Look for partial atomic charges: This data will help you deduce oxidation states. In Mulliken analysis, a positive charge indicates electron deficiency (oxidation), while a negative charge indicates electron excess (reduction).\n\n4. **Determine Oxidation States:**\n   - **Hydrogen (H):** Usually has an oxidation state of +1.\n   - **Oxygen (O):** Usually has an oxidation state of -2.\n   - **Sulfur (S):** The oxidation state can vary, so you'll need to use the Mulliken charges to deduce it.\n\n5. **Calculate Based on Known Oxidation States:**\n   - For H2SO3, the sum of oxidation states should equal the molecule's charge, which is 0 for a neutral molecule.\n   - Using known values:\n     - \\(2 \\times (+1) + \\text{Oxidation state of S} + 3 \\times (-2) = 0\\)\n     - Solving: \\(2 + \\text{Oxidation state of S} - 6 = 0\\)\n     - Oxidation state of S = +4\n\n6. **Interpret Mulliken Results:**\n   - The Mulliken analysis might show sulfur having a partial positive charge, supporting its oxidation state of +4.\n   - Verify that the Mulliken charges align with expected oxidation states (for example, sulfur should have a lesser positive charge compared to hydrogen).\n\n7. **Conclude:**\n   - You have identified the oxidation states:\n     - Hydrogen: +1\n     - Oxygen: -2\n     - Sulfur: +4\n\nBy following these steps, you have used a computational chemistry tool to validate the oxidation states in sulfurous acid using Mulliken population analysis. If you need more detailed output interpretation, consult the specific documentation of the `mulliken` tool you are using."
