        "content": "The error message you're encountering indicates that the OpenGL package is not installed in your Python environment. To resolve this issue and successfully run NeHe's tutorial, you'll need to install the `PyOpenGL` library. Here's how you can do that:\n\n1. **Install PyOpenGL**:\n   - Open your command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux).\n   - Run the following command to install PyOpenGL and PyOpenGL_accelerate (which can improve performance):\n\n     ```\n     pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate\n     ```\n\n   - If you're using a virtual environment, make sure it's activated before running the command.\n\n2. **Verify the Installation**:\n   - After the installation is complete, verify that the library is installed correctly by running a simple Python script. Open a Python shell and try importing the module:\n\n     ```python\n     from OpenGL.GL import *\n     ```\n\n   - If no error occurs, the installation was successful.\n\n3. **Check Python Environment**:\n   - Ensure that your script is running in the same Python environment where you installed the libraries. Sometimes, multiple Python installations can lead to such issues.\n\n4. **Update `pip`** (Optional):\n   - If you encounter issues during installation, consider updating `pip` to the latest version:\n\n     ```\n     pip install --upgrade pip\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the ImportError and proceed with running NeHe's OpenGL tutorial in Python 2.7.3. Keep in mind that Python 2.7 is an outdated version, and if feasible, consider upgrading to Python 3.x for better support and features."
