Is there any way to prevent the python.exe from closing immediately after it completes execution?"

        "content": "Yes, there are a few ways you can prevent the Python window from closing immediately after execution, allowing you to see the output:\n\n1. **Use a `input()` statement at the end:** Add an `input()` statement at the end of your program to keep the window open until you press Enter.\n\n   ```python\n   width = float(input(\"Enter the width: \"))\n   height = float(input(\"Enter the height: \"))\n   area = width * height\n   print(\"The area is\", area, \"square units.\")\n   input(\"Press Enter to exit...\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Run the script from a command prompt or terminal:** Instead of double-clicking the Python file, open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac/Linux), navigate to the directory containing your Python script, and run it by typing `python your_script_name.py`. This way, the window will stay open after the script finishes, allowing you to see the output.\n\n3. **Use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** Running your code within an IDE like PyCharm, VSCode, Jupyter Notebook, or IDLE can keep the output window open, as these environments manage the execution process differently.\n\nAny of these methods should allow you to view the output without the window closing immediately."
