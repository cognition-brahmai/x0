I'm trying to run a query to retrieve the most recent few objects, i.e., Entities with the my_date field that are the most recent. However, on trying to order the objects by time using the 'order_by' function, I'm not getting the desired output. Both queries mentioned in the code below are returning the same objects in the same order. The SQL Alchemy documentation mentions the use of the '-' to reverse the order, but I'm sure I'm missing something here. Could someone provide assistance on this?\n\n```python\nmy_date = Field(DateTime())\n\nentities = MyEntity.query.order_by(MyEntity.time).limit(3).all()\nentities = MyEntity.query.order_by(-MyEntity.time).limit(3).all()\n```"

        "content": "When using SQLAlchemy to query your database and order results, it's important to ensure that you're using the correct syntax and methods for the version you're working with. In your case, it looks like you're trying to order results by a `DateTime` field to get the most recent entries. However, the way you're using the `order_by` function may not be achieving this goal.\n\nHere's how you can properly order the results in descending order to get the most recent entries:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import desc\n\n# Order by 'my_date' in ascending order\nentities_asc = MyEntity.query.order_by(MyEntity.my_date).limit(3).all()\n\n# Order by 'my_date' in descending order to get the most recent entries\nentities_desc = MyEntity.query.order_by(desc(MyEntity.my_date)).limit(3).all()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Use `desc()` for Descending Order**: Instead of using `-MyEntity.my_date`, use `desc(MyEntity.my_date)` from SQLAlchemy. This is the recommended way to specify descending order.\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Field Name**: Make sure the field name in your `order_by` clause matches exactly with the column name defined in your model (`my_date` in this case).\n\n3. **Check the Model Definition**: Ensure that `my_date` is correctly defined in your model and is indeed a `DateTime` field.\n\n4. **Verify Data and Database Connection**: Double-check the data in your database to make sure there are varied timestamps and confirm that your database connection and session setup are correct.\n\nBy using the `desc()` function, SQLAlchemy should correctly order your entities by the `my_date` field in descending order, allowing you to retrieve the most recent entries."
