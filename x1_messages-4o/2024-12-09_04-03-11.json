This tool generates a `requirements.txt` file based only on the imports in your project files.\n\n   First, install `pipreqs` if you haven't already:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pipreqs\n   ```\n\n   Then, navigate to your project directory and run:\n\n   ```bash\n   pipreqs . --force\n   ```\n\n   This will create a `requirements.txt` file listing only the packages that are actually imported in your code.\n\n2. **Compare with existing `requirements.txt`:**\n   Compare the newly generated `requirements.txt` with the one you generated using `pip freeze`. Packages listed in the old requirements file but not in the new one might be unused.\n\n3. **Use `pip-autoremove`:**\n   This tool helps to uninstall a package and its unused dependencies. Install it using:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pip-autoremove\n   ```\n\n   Use it to remove a package you suspect is unused:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip-autoremove <package-name> -y\n   ```\n\n   Note that this will remove the specified package and its dependencies that are no longer required by any other installed package.\n\n4. **Manually verify and clean up:**\n   It's a good practice to manually verify any packages before removing them. Sometimes packages are used indirectly or conditionally in your project.\n\n5. **Virtual Environment:**\n   Consider using a virtual environment to manage your project's dependencies. This allows you to start with a clean slate and only install the packages you need.\n\n6. **Tools like `pipenv` or `poetry`:**\n   These tools help manage dependencies more efficiently by keeping track of which packages are used, allowing you to easily add or remove packages as needed.\n\nBy following these steps, you can keep your project dependencies organized and remove any unused packages."
