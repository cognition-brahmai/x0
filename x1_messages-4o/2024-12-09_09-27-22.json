        "content": "To generate an HTML page with a form that includes two input fields using AI, you can use a code generation tool or AI-powered coding assistant. However, you can also manually create a simple HTML page with the form as follows:\n\nHere's a basic example of an HTML page with a form containing two input fields:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Form Example</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n            margin: 20px;\n        }\n        form {\n            max-width: 300px;\n            margin: auto;\n        }\n        input {\n            width: 100%;\n            padding: 10px;\n            margin: 5px 0;\n            box-sizing: border-box;\n        }\n        button {\n            padding: 10px;\n            background-color: #4CAF50;\n            color: white;\n            border: none;\n            cursor: pointer;\n        }\n        button:hover {\n            background-color: #45a049;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n    <h1>Contact Form</h1>\n    <form action=\"#\" method=\"POST\">\n        <label for=\"name\">Name:</label>\n        <input type=\"text\" id=\"name\" name=\"name\" required>\n\n        <label for=\"email\">Email:</label>\n        <input type=\"email\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\" required>\n        \n        <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n    </form>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **DOCTYPE and HTML Tags**: The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines the document type and HTML version. The `<html>` tag is the root element of an HTML page.\n- **Head Section**: Contains metadata and links like CSS for styling. The `<title>` tag sets the title of the HTML document.\n- **Body Section**: The main content of the HTML document goes here. We have a form with two input fields, one for the name and another for the email.\n- **CSS Styling**: Basic styles are included within the `<style>` tag to enhance the appearance of the form and its components.\n- **Form and Inputs**: The form uses POST method (can be adjusted based on your server setup), and it contains two labeled input fields for name and email, each with the `required` attribute to ensure they are filled out before submission.\n\nYou can copy this code into a text editor and save it with a `.html` extension. Then, open the file in a web browser to see your form in action."
