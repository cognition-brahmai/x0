Currently, my code is clustering particles at the center due to the conversion between spherical and Cartesian coordinates.

        "content": "The issue you're facing with clustering at the center is due to the way you're generating the radial component of the spherical coordinates. To achieve a uniform distribution of points within a spherical volume, you need to adjust how the radius is calculated. In your current approach, using a uniform distribution directly for the radius results in more points near the center.\n\nThe MATLAB code you provided uses a technique involving the gamma function to distribute points uniformly within an n-dimensional sphere. In Python, you can achieve a similar uniform distribution by modifying the radial component calculation. Instead of generating the radius directly from a uniform distribution, you should generate it such that the volume's probability density is uniform.\n\nHere's how you can modify your Python code to achieve a uniform distribution within a spherical volume:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef new_positions_spherical_coordinates(number_of_particles):\n    # Generate random variables\n    u = np.random.uniform(0.0, 1.0, (number_of_particles, 1))\n    theta = np.random.uniform(0.0, np.pi * 2, (number_of_particles, 1))\n    phi = np.arccos(1 - 2 * np.random.uniform(0.0, 1.0, (number_of_particles, 1)))\n    \n    # Correct the radial distribution\n    radius = u ** (1/3)  # Cubic root to ensure uniform distribution in volume\n    \n    # Convert spherical coordinates to Cartesian coordinates\n    x = radius * np.sin(phi) * np.cos(theta)\n    y = radius * np.sin(phi) * np.sin(theta)\n    z = radius * np.cos(phi)\n    \n    return (x, y, z)\n\n# Example usage\nnumber_of_particles = 1000\nx, y, z = new_positions_spherical_coordinates(number_of_particles)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Radial Component (`radius`)**: Instead of using `numpy.random.uniform` directly, we use `u ** (1/3)`, where `u` is a uniformly distributed random variable. This transformation ensures the radius is distributed in a way that accounts for the volume of the sphere, giving a uniform distribution of points within the sphere.\n\n2. **Theta Range**: Ensure that `theta` covers the full range from 0 to `2 * pi` which is typical for spherical coordinates in 3D.\n\nBy making these changes, the particles will be more uniformly distributed throughout the spherical volume, rather than clustering towards the center."
