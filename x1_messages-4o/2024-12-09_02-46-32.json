I intended to initialize a list of lists with a length of `n`, but when I tried to append an element to one of the sublists, it was added to all sublists. Here is an example of my code and its output:\n\n```python\nx = [[]] * 3\nx[1].append(0)\nprint(x)  # outputs [[0], [0], [0]]\n```\n\nI expected the output to be `[[], [0], []]`. Can anyone explain this behavior?"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is due to how Python handles object references when using the `*` operator to create lists. When you initialize a list of lists using the syntax `x = [[]] * n`, you're actually creating a list where each element is a reference to the same list object. This means that all the sublists in `x` are not independent; they are all pointing to the same list in memory.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of what's happening with your code:\n\n1. `x = [[]] * 3` creates a list `x` containing three references to the same inner list `[]`. It does not create three separate empty lists. Instead, each element in `x` points to the same list object.\n\n2. When you execute `x[1].append(0)`, you are appending `0` to the list that `x[1]` (and `x[0]`, `x[2]`) references. Since all sublists are actually the same list, the change is reflected in all of them.\n\nTherefore, the output is `[[0], [0], [0]]` because all three elements in `x` are referencing the same list, which now contains the element `0`.\n\nTo create a list of independent lists, you can use a list comprehension, which ensures that each sublist is a separate object:\n\n```python\nx = [[] for _ in range(3)]\nx[1].append(0)\nprint(x)  # outputs [[], [0], []]\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, `x` is initialized with three separate list objects, so modifying one sublist does not affect the others."
