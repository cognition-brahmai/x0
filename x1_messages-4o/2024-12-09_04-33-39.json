        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the format of your JSON file. The file contains multiple JSON objects, each on a separate line, but they are not combined into a single JSON array. The `pd.read_json()` function in pandas expects either a single JSON object or an array of JSON objects.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you have a couple of options:\n\n### Option 1: Use `lines=True` in `pd.read_json`\nStarting from pandas 0.19.0, you can use the `lines` parameter in `pd.read_json()` to read a file where each line is a separate JSON object. Since you mentioned you are using pandas 0.14.0, this parameter might not be available. However, if you upgrade your pandas version, you can use:\n\n```python\ndf = pd.read_json(path, lines=True)\n```\n\n### Option 2: Read the file line by line and construct DataFrame\nIf you cannot upgrade pandas or prefer to use your current setup, you can read the file line by line and then construct a DataFrame:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport json\n\n# Initialize an empty list to store the JSON objects\ndata = []\n\n# Open the file and read line by line\nwith open(path, 'r') as file:\n    for line in file:\n        # Parse each line as a JSON object\n        data.append(json.loads(line))\n\n# Create a DataFrame from the list of JSON objects\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n```\n\n### Option 3: Manually Convert to JSON Array\nIf you wish to manually convert your JSON file into a valid JSON array format, you can do this by wrapping all the JSON objects in square brackets and separating them with commas. Here's a quick example of how you might do this:\n\n1. Open the JSON file in a text editor.\n2. Add a `[` at the beginning and a `]` at the end.\n3. Replace each newline between JSON objects with a comma.\n\nThis manual method can be cumbersome for large files, and the above Python code is generally more efficient.\n\nThese approaches should help you load your JSON data into a pandas DataFrame successfully."
