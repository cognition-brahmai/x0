The similarity between two words is calculated as the cosine similarity between their respective vectors. \nHere is a sample of the top 5 words most similar to \"happy\":\n1. joyful (cosine similarity = 0.82)\n2. pleased (cosine similarity = 0.78)\n3. content (cosine similarity = 0.74)\n4. ecstatic (cosine similarity = 0.70)\n5. elated (cosine similarity = 0.67)\nWhat other words have a cosine similarity of at least 0.6 with \"happy\"?"

        "content": "To determine the words that have a cosine similarity of at least 0.6 with \"happy,\" we would typically need to access the trained Word2Vec model and calculate the cosine similarities for each word in the vocabulary. However, based on the provided sample, we can suggest other words that are generally considered semantically similar to \"happy\" and might have a cosine similarity of 0.6 or higher.\n\nHere are some words that could potentially meet that threshold, based on common semantic relationships:\n\n1. Cheerful\n2. Delighted\n3. Blissful\n4. Satisfied\n5. Gleeful\n\nThese words are often used in similar contexts as \"happy\" and might exhibit a high cosine similarity when evaluated using a Word2Vec model trained on a large and relevant dataset."
