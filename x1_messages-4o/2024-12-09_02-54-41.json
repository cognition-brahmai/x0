I have previously looked at related questions, however, I am unable to reproduce the results provided by the algorithm. I ran the following code to generate a decision tree:\n\n```python\nfrom StringIO import StringIO\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.tree.export import export_graphviz\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import mutual_info_classif\n\nX = [[1,0,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,1], [0,1,0]]\ny = [1,0,1,1]\n\nclf = DecisionTreeClassifier()\nclf.fit(X, y)\n\nfeat_importance = clf.tree_.compute_feature_importances(normalize=False)\nprint(\"feat importance = \" + str(feat_importance))\n\nout = StringIO()\nout = export_graphviz(clf, out_file='test/tree.dot')\n```\nThis resulted in feature importance as below: \n```python\nfeat importance = [0.25 0.08333333 0.04166667]\n```\nThe decision tree visualisation is as follows: [decision tree](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ORz4y.png). \n\nI understand from this [answer](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/92843/194377) that the importance is calculated using a specific formula (G is node impurity or gini impurity). However, when I apply this formula for feature 1, I get a different result. Another [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15821880/1618893) suggests the importance is weighted by the probability of reaching the node. Yet again, when I apply this method, I get a different result. Can someone clarify how the feature importance is correctly calculated?"

        "content": "The feature importance in a decision tree created using scikit-learn is calculated based on the reduction of impurity (such as Gini impurity or entropy) brought by each feature in the decision tree. Let's break down how it works and how you can calculate it manually to ensure you get the same results as the scikit-learn implementation.\n\n### Decision Tree Feature Importance Calculation:\n\n1. **Node Impurity**: Each node in the tree has a certain impurity. For classification trees, this is often measured using Gini impurity or entropy. The impurity \\( I(N) \\) of a node \\( N \\) is calculated using the formula specific to the impurity measure chosen.\n\n2. **Weighted Impurity Decrease**: When a node is split, the impurity of that node decreases. The decrease in impurity is weighted by the probability of reaching that node. This probability is simply the proportion of samples that reach the node compared to the total number of samples.\n\n3. **Feature Importance**: The importance of a feature is computed as the sum of the impurity decrease brought by all splits where this feature is used. If a feature is used multiple times in the tree, all its contributions are summed up.\n\n### Steps to Manually Calculate Feature Importance:\n\n1. **Calculate Impurity Decrease for Each Node**:\n   - For a node split using a specific feature, calculate the impurity of the parent node and subtract the weighted impurities of the child nodes.\n   - Calculate the decrease for each node split.\n\n2. **Aggregate by Feature**:\n   - Sum the impurity decreases for all nodes where the feature is used.\n\n3. **Normalize (Optional)**:\n   - The importance values can be normalized by dividing by the sum of all feature importances to make it a percentage.\n\n### Example Walkthrough:\n\nLet's consider your specific tree and data:\n\n1. **Initial Data**: \n   - Samples: \\( X = [[1,0,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,1], [0,1,0]] \\)\n   - Labels: \\( y = [1,0,1,1] \\)\n\n2. **Tree Structure & Splits**:\n   - You can interpret the tree visualization and note down all the nodes, their impurities, and the splits.\n\n3. **Calculate Impurity Decrease**:\n   - For each split, compute the impurity decrease as described above.\n\n4. **Feature Contributions**:\n   - Sum up all contributions from each feature across the tree.\n\n5. **Normalization**:\n   - If you are comparing them directly, make sure they are normalized.\n\nBy manually following these steps, you should be able to reproduce the feature importance values that scikit-learn provides.\n\n### Example Calculation:\n\nLet's perform a simple calculation for the first feature based on your mentioned tree:\n\n- Suppose the root node has an impurity \\( I(root) \\).\n- It splits into two child nodes with impurities \\( I(left) \\) and \\( I(right) \\), with the split weighted by the number of samples reaching each node.\n- The impurity reduction due to this split is:\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Impurity Decrease} = I(\\text{root}) - \\left( \\frac{\\text{samples in left}}{\\text{total samples}} \\times I(\\text{left}) + \\frac{\\text{samples in right}}{\\text{total samples}} \\times I(\\text{right}) \\right)\n  \\]\n\n- Repeat for each split using the feature and sum up all decreases.\n\nBy aligning these calculations with the tree visualization you provided, you should be able to match the calculated importance to what scikit-learn outputs.\n\nIf you're still having issues, double-check the tree structure and ensure all node impurities and sample weights are correctly accounted for. This process, while detailed, should clarify how feature importances are computed in scikit-learn\u2019s decision trees."
