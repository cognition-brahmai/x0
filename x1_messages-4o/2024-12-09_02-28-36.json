However, I'm having trouble viewing the schema of the sqlite3 database that Django created. In my Django project, I have a `db.sqlite3` file. When I use the .database command in sqlite3, it only shows me 'main'. How can I see more details about the database and tables in sqlite3, similar to what I can see in MySQL?"

        "content": "To view the schema and details of the tables in your SQLite database (`db.sqlite3`) used by your Django project, you can use the SQLite command-line tool. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\n1. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your `db.sqlite3` file is located.\n\n2. **Open the SQLite Shell**: Use the following command to open the SQLite shell and load your database:\n\n   ```bash\n   sqlite3 db.sqlite3\n   ```\n\n3. **List Tables**: Once in the SQLite shell, you can list all the tables in your database using the `.tables` command:\n\n   ```sql\n   .tables\n   ```\n\n   This will display a list of all tables created by Django's ORM.\n\n4. **View Schema of a Table**: To view the schema of a specific table, use the `.schema` command followed by the table name. For example, to view the schema of a table named `blog_post`, you would use:\n\n   ```sql\n   .schema blog_post\n   ```\n\n   This will show you the SQL statement used to create the table, giving you details about its columns and their data types.\n\n5. **View All Schemas**: If you want to see the schema for all tables, simply use:\n\n   ```sql\n   .schema\n   ```\n\n6. **Querying Data**: You can perform SQL queries directly to view data. For example, to see all records in the `blog_post` table, use:\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT * FROM blog_post;\n   ```\n\n7. **Exit the SQLite Shell**: To exit the SQLite shell, type:\n\n   ```sql\n   .exit\n   ```\n\nUsing these steps, you can explore the structure and contents of your SQLite database just like you would in MySQL or any other relational database management system."
