I am currently using `datetime.strptime` or something equivalent, but the problem is that the month, day of month, and hour are not zero padded. The formatting directive listed here does not seem to be able to parse this automatically. What is the best approach to accomplish this?"

        "content": "To parse non-zero padded timestamps in Python, you can use the `datetime.strptime` method, which can handle non-zero padded values using appropriate format codes. For your specific case, where the timestamp is in the format `3/1/2014 9:55`, you can use the format string `%m/%d/%Y %H:%M`. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# The timestamp string you want to parse\ntimestamp_str = \"3/1/2014 9:55\"\n\n# The format string that matches the timestamp\nformat_str = \"%m/%d/%Y %H:%M\"\n\n# Parsing the timestamp string into a datetime object\nparsed_datetime = datetime.strptime(timestamp_str, format_str)\n\n# Output the parsed datetime object\nprint(parsed_datetime)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the format string:\n\n- `%m` matches the month as a zero-padded decimal number (01 to 12). However, it can also parse non-zero padded months (1 to 12).\n- `%d` matches the day of the month as a zero-padded decimal number (01 to 31), and similarly, it can parse non-zero padded days (1 to 31).\n- `%Y` matches the year with century as a decimal number.\n- `%H` matches the hour (00 to 23), which can also handle non-zero padded hours (0 to 23).\n- `%M` matches the minute as a zero-padded decimal number (00 to 59), which can handle non-zero padded minutes (0 to 59).\n\nThis approach should correctly parse your non-zero padded timestamps without any issues."
