The electronic configuration should be in the subscripts of the symbol and the oxidation states should be in parentheses. The data should be displayed in an HTML table format."

        "content": "To expand the table of chemical elements using shell commands and display it in an HTML table format with the specified requirements, you can follow these steps. This solution involves using a combination of shell scripting, command-line tools like `awk`, `sed`, and potentially `bc` for arithmetic calculations.\n\n1. **Prepare a CSV File**: First, you need a CSV file (`elements.csv`) with basic information about the elements, such as atomic number, symbol, and name. You can find such files online or create one manually. Here's an example structure:\n\n   ```csv\n   AtomicNumber,Symbol,Name\n   1,H,Hydrogen\n   2,He,Helium\n   3,Li,Lithium\n   ...\n   ```\n\n2. **Script to Generate HTML**: Use the following shell script to generate an HTML table. This script assumes you have a file `elements.csv` and a file `configurations.txt` containing electronic configurations and `oxidation_states.txt` containing oxidation states for each element.\n\n   ```bash\n   #!/bin/bash\n\n   # Create HTML file\n   echo \"<html><body><table border='1'>\" > elements.html\n   echo \"<tr><th>Atomic Number</th><th>Symbol</th><th>Electronic Configuration</th><th>Oxidation States</th><th>Inverse of Atomic Number Squared</th></tr>\" >> elements.html\n\n   # Read CSV file\n   while IFS=, read -r atomic_number symbol name; do\n       # Skip header\n       if [[ $atomic_number == \"AtomicNumber\" ]]; then\n           continue\n       fi\n\n       # Get electronic configuration and oxidation states\n       electronic_configuration=$(grep \"^$atomic_number \" configurations.txt | cut -d' ' -f2)\n       oxidation_states=$(grep \"^$atomic_number \" oxidation_states.txt | cut -d' ' -f2)\n\n       # Calculate inverse of atomic number squared\n       inverse_atomic_number_squared=$(echo \"scale=6; 1/($atomic_number^2)\" | bc -l)\n\n       # Append row to HTML file\n       echo \"<tr><td>$atomic_number</td><td>$symbol</td><td>$electronic_configuration</td><td>($oxidation_states)</td><td>$inverse_atomic_number_squared</td></tr>\" >> elements.html\n   done < elements.csv\n\n   # Close HTML tags\n   echo \"</table></body></html>\" >> elements.html\n   ```\n\n3. **Data Preparation**: You need to prepare `configurations.txt` and `oxidation_states.txt` files. These files should have atomic numbers followed by the required information:\n\n   **configurations.txt**\n   ```\n   1 1s\u00b9\n   2 1s\u00b2\n   3 [He]2s\u00b9\n   ...\n   ```\n\n   **oxidation_states.txt**\n   ```\n   1 +1\n   2 0\n   3 +1\n   ...\n   ```\n\n4. **Run the Script**: Make sure the script is executable and then run it:\n\n   ```bash\n   chmod +x generate_elements_html.sh\n   ./generate_elements_html.sh\n   ```\n\n5. **View the Output**: Open `elements.html` in a web browser to view the table with the expanded information.\n\nThis script will generate an HTML table with each element's atomic number, symbol, electronic configuration, oxidation states, and the inverse of the atomic number squared. Adjust the paths and file names as necessary based on your actual file locations and names."
