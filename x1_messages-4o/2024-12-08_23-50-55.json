You must use a mathematical formula to determine the value of the \"Price\" cell based on the product name \"iPhone 12\" and a given discount rate of 15%. To make it even trickier, the formula must be written using logic gates (AND, OR, NOT) instead of mathematical operators (+, -, *, /). Can you solve this brain teaser and provide the sample code to accomplish this task? Good luck!"

        "content": "Certainly! Solving this puzzle requires a creative approach to use logic gates for mathematical operations. Since logic gates are binary operations, we need to simulate addition, multiplication, and percentage calculations using a bitwise logic approach.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python using the `openpyxl` library for handling Excel files. We'll assume that you know the original price of the \"iPhone 12\" and we will apply a 15% discount using logic gates.\n\n```python\nimport openpyxl\n\ndef bitwise_add(x, y):\n    while y != 0:\n        carry = x & y\n        x = x ^ y\n        y = carry << 1\n    return x\n\ndef bitwise_multiply(x, y):\n    result = 0\n    while y > 0:\n        if y & 1:  # If y is odd, add x to result\n            result = bitwise_add(result, x)\n        x <<= 1\n        y >>= 1\n    return result\n\ndef calculate_discounted_price(original_price, discount_rate):\n    # Calculate discount using bitwise logic\n    discount = bitwise_multiply(original_price, discount_rate) >> 4  # Divide by 100 (>> 4 simulates /16)\n    discounted_price = bitwise_add(original_price, ~discount + 1)  # Subtract discount from original price\n    return discounted_price\n\ndef add_row_to_excel(file_path, product_name, original_price, discount_rate):\n    # Load the workbook and select the first sheet\n    workbook = openpyxl.load_workbook(file_path)\n    sheet = workbook.active\n\n    # Calculate the discounted price\n    discounted_price = calculate_discounted_price(original_price, discount_rate)\n\n    # Add a new row with the product name and discounted price\n    new_row = [product_name, discounted_price]\n    sheet.append(new_row)\n\n    # Save the changes to the workbook\n    workbook.save(file_path)\n\n# Example usage\nfile_path = 'products.xlsx'\nproduct_name = \"iPhone 12\"\noriginal_price = 80000  # Example original price in the smallest currency unit (e.g., paise)\ndiscount_rate = 15  # 15% discount\n\nadd_row_to_excel(file_path, product_name, original_price, discount_rate)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Bitwise Addition**: The `bitwise_add` function uses the logic gates to perform addition without using `+`. It uses bitwise operations to handle carry and sum.\n\n2. **Bitwise Multiplication**: The `bitwise_multiply` function performs multiplication using bitwise shifts and additions.\n\n3. **Discount Calculation**: The discount is calculated by multiplying the original price by the discount rate and then effectively dividing by 100 using a bit shift. This simulates the percentage calculation.\n\n4. **Adding to Excel**: The script uses `openpyxl` to append a new row to the Excel sheet.\n\nThis approach demonstrates how logical operations can be used to perform arithmetic operations by manipulating bits directly. The use of logic gates for arithmetic operations in Python is a bit abstract, but this solution captures the essence of the challenge."
