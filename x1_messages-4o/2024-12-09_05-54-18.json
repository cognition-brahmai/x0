Is there a way to achieve this operation? Should I use tuples for this purpose? If neither lists nor tuples support these operands, can I define my own operation? If not, should I create a new vector3 class to handle this?"

        "content": "In Python, you can indeed perform operations like vector subtraction on lists using list comprehension or by defining a custom class. Lists and tuples themselves do not support direct subtraction, but you can implement this functionality in a couple of different ways:\n\n### Using List Comprehension:\nYou can subtract two lists element-wise using list comprehension. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nvector1 = [2, 2, 2]\nvector2 = [1, 1, 1]\n\nresult = [a - b for a, b in zip(vector1, vector2)]\nprint(result)  # Output: [1, 1, 1]\n```\n\n### Using NumPy:\nIf you're working with numerical data, using the NumPy library can be very efficient and convenient:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nvector1 = np.array([2, 2, 2])\nvector2 = np.array([1, 1, 1])\n\nresult = vector1 - vector2\nprint(result)  # Output: [1 1 1]\n```\n\n### Defining a Custom Vector3 Class:\nIf you want a more structured approach or plan to perform more vector operations, defining a custom `Vector3` class might be a good idea:\n\n```python\nclass Vector3:\n    def __init__(self, x, y, z):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n        self.z = z\n\n    def __sub__(self, other):\n        return Vector3(self.x - other.x, self.y - other.y, self.z - other.z)\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f'[{self.x}, {self.y}, {self.z}]'\n\nvector1 = Vector3(2, 2, 2)\nvector2 = Vector3(1, 1, 1)\n\nresult = vector1 - vector2\nprint(result)  # Output: [1, 1, 1]\n```\n\nThis custom class approach gives you the flexibility to add more vector operations and methods in the future, such as addition, dot product, cross product, etc. Choose the method that best fits your needs and the complexity of your project."
