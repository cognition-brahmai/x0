I have all the settings initiated with the virtual environment created and the URL set as 127.0.0.1:8888. However, when I click on the run cell button, I get a message from Jupyter Notebook asking for the URL and authentication token. According to the Jupyter update blog, my web browser should be initiated which generates a token for access, but I do not see my browser loading. How can I solve this?"

        "content": "When using Jupyter notebooks within PyCharm, encountering issues with authentication tokens due to a Jupyter update can be a bit tricky. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Jupyter Notebook Configuration:**\n   - Open a terminal or command prompt and run `jupyter notebook --generate-config` to create a configuration file if you haven't already.\n   - Locate the `jupyter_notebook_config.py` file, typically found in the `.jupyter` directory within your home directory.\n\n2. **Disable Authentication Token Temporarily:**\n   - Open the `jupyter_notebook_config.py` file with a text editor.\n   - Uncomment the line `# c.NotebookApp.token = ''` and set it to an empty string like `c.NotebookApp.token = ''`. This will disable the token authentication temporarily.\n\n3. **Manually Start Jupyter Notebook:**\n   - Open a terminal and activate your virtual environment.\n   - Run `jupyter notebook` to start the Jupyter server manually.\n   - You should see a URL with a token in the terminal output. Copy this URL.\n\n4. **Configure PyCharm:**\n   - Open PyCharm and go to `File > Settings` (or `PyCharm > Preferences` on macOS).\n   - Navigate to `Build, Execution, Deployment > Jupyter`.\n   - Set the Jupyter server URL to the one you copied from the terminal output.\n\n5. **Re-enable Token Authentication:**\n   - Once you have everything working, it's a good practice to re-enable token authentication for security.\n   - Comment out or remove the line `c.NotebookApp.token = ''` in the `jupyter_notebook_config.py` file.\n\n6. **Browser Issue:**\n   - If your browser is not automatically opening, ensure that your default browser is set correctly and that no security software is blocking the launch.\n   - Alternatively, manually open your browser and paste the Jupyter server URL from the terminal output.\n\n7. **PyCharm Updates:**\n   - Ensure that you are using the latest version of PyCharm, as updates might contain fixes for Jupyter integration.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with the Jupyter notebook token in PyCharm. If you still encounter problems, you might want to check PyCharm's logs for more detailed error messages or consider reaching out to JetBrains support for assistance."
