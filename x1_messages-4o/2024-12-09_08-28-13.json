I am using the following code: \n\n```\nfile_errors_location = \"C:\\\\Users\\\\atheelm\\\\Documents\\\\python excel mission\\\\errors1.xlsx\"\nworkbook_errors = xlrd.open_workbook(file_errors_location)\n```\n\nHowever, when I check the number of sheets using the command `workbook_errors.nsheets`, I get \"0\" even though the file has some sheets. When I print the `workbook_errors` object, I get `xlrd.book.Book object at 0x2..`. There are no error messages but I am not able to access the sheets in the xlsx file. Can you guide me on how to correctly open the xlsx file using Python 3 and the xlrd library?"

        "content": "The issue you are encountering is likely due to the fact that the `xlrd` library, as of version 2.0.0, no longer supports the `.xlsx` file format. It now only supports `.xls` files. This change was made due to security concerns related to the dependency `xlrd` had on a third-party library for handling `.xlsx` files.\n\nTo handle `.xlsx` files, you can use the `openpyxl` library, which supports reading `.xlsx` files. Here's how you can modify your code to use `openpyxl` instead:\n\n1. Install `openpyxl` if you haven't already:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install openpyxl\n   ```\n\n2. Use the following code to open and read your `.xlsx` file:\n\n   ```python\n   from openpyxl import load_workbook\n\n   file_errors_location = \"C:\\\\Users\\\\atheelm\\\\Documents\\\\python excel mission\\\\errors1.xlsx\"\n   workbook_errors = load_workbook(filename=file_errors_location, read_only=True)\n   \n   # Print the number of sheets\n   print(len(workbook_errors.sheetnames))\n   \n   # Access a specific sheet\n   sheet = workbook_errors.active  # or workbook_errors['SheetName']\n   print(sheet.title)\n   ```\n\nThis code uses `openpyxl` to open the workbook and provides access to the sheets within it. You can iterate over `workbook_errors.sheetnames` to see all sheet names or access a sheet directly using its name."
