For example, I have two dictionaries: \n\n```python\nmyRDP = { 'Actinobacter': 'GATCGA...TCA', 'subtilus sp.': 'ATCGATT...ACT' }\nmyNames = { 'Actinobacter': '8924342' }\n```\n\nI want to print out the value for 'Actinobacter' (8924342) as it matches a key in `myRDP`. I've attempted to use nested loops and a single loop but it either results in slow execution or a KeyError. Is there a possibly a more efficient function implemented in C for doing this? \n\nHere's my current approach which is very slow:\n\n```python\nfor key in myRDP:\n    for jey in myNames:\n        if key == jey:\n            print key, myNames[key]\n```\n\nAnd here's the one that results in a KeyError:\n\n```python\nfor key in myRDP:\n    print myNames[key]\n```"

        "content": "To efficiently find matching keys between two large dictionaries and print the corresponding values, you can make use of dictionary lookups, which are on average O(1) operations. Here\u2019s a more efficient way to achieve what you want, by iterating over the keys of one dictionary and checking for their existence in the other dictionary:\n\n```python\n# Efficient approach\nfor key in myRDP:\n    if key in myNames:\n        print(key, myNames[key])\n```\n\nThis approach avoids the nested loop and reduces the time complexity significantly. The KeyError you encountered occurs because not all keys in `myRDP` exist in `myNames`. The `if key in myNames` check ensures that you only attempt to access values for keys that exist in `myNames`.\n\nAdditionally, if you want to ensure optimal performance, you can use set intersections, which may be beneficial when dealing with very large datasets. Here\u2019s how you can do it using set operations:\n\n```python\n# Using set intersection for optimal performance\nmatching_keys = set(myRDP.keys()).intersection(myNames.keys())\n\nfor key in matching_keys:\n    print(key, myNames[key])\n```\n\nThis approach first calculates the intersection of keys in both dictionaries, which can be faster if you have a significantly large number of keys, as it reduces the number of lookups needed."
