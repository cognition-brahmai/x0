        "content": "If `pkill` isn't working as expected, you can use a combination of `ps`, `grep`, `awk`, and `xargs` to terminate processes that match a given partial name. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **List Processes**: First, ensure you are correctly identifying the processes by listing them using `ps` and `grep`.\n\n   ```bash\n   ps aux | grep my_pattern\n   ```\n\n2. **Terminate Processes**: Once you've confirmed the processes you want to terminate, use the following command to kill them:\n\n   ```bash\n   ps aux | grep my_pattern | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9\n   ```\n\n   Let's break down this command:\n   - `ps aux`: Lists all running processes.\n   - `grep my_pattern`: Filters the list to show only processes that match your pattern.\n   - `grep -v grep`: Excludes the `grep` command itself from the list.\n   - `awk '{print $2}'`: Extracts the process ID (PID) from the second column of the output.\n   - `xargs kill -9`: Sends the SIGKILL signal to each PID, forcefully terminating them.\n\n**Important Note**: Be cautious when using `kill -9`, as it forcefully terminates processes and does not allow them to clean up resources. It\u2019s generally better to try `kill` or `kill -15` first to allow processes to terminate gracefully.\n\n3. **Verify Termination**: After executing the command, you can verify that the processes have been terminated by listing them again:\n\n   ```bash\n   ps aux | grep my_pattern\n   ```\n\nIf you still see the processes, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to terminate them, or consider running the command with `sudo` if needed."
