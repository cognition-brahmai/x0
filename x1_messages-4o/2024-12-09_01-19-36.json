        "content": "I'm currently experimenting with the BERT architecture and noticed that the final hidden layers are often used as text representation, which is then passed on to other models for further downstream tasks. Specifically, I found that the [CLS] token of each sentence is typically used in this process. After reading through several discussions, the common explanation seems to be that since BERT is bidirectional, the [CLS] token is encoded with all representative information of all tokens through the multi-layer encoding procedure, and that the representation of [CLS] is individual in different sentences. However, I'm wondering why the author chose to ignore the other information, such as each token's vector, and didn't use methods like averaging, max_pool or others to make use of all information instead of just using the [CLS] token for classification. How does this [CLS] token help in comparison to the average of all token vectors?"

        "content": "The use of the [CLS] token in BERT as a pooled representation for classification tasks is indeed a design choice made by the authors. The [CLS] token is intended to capture a global representation of the input sequence, and there are several reasons why it is often preferred over averaging or pooling all token vectors:\n\n1. **Representation Purpose**: The [CLS] token is specifically designed to aggregate information from the entire input sequence during training, particularly for tasks like sentence classification. The model is trained with the objective that the [CLS] vector will be the most useful summary of the sequence for the task at hand.\n\n2. **Task-Specific Fine-Tuning**: During the fine-tuning phase, the [CLS] token can be more easily adapted to the specific classification task. The model learns to adjust the [CLS] embedding to capture the most relevant features for the task, whereas averaging or max pooling might dilute important task-specific information.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: Using the [CLS] token is computationally efficient. Instead of processing multiple token vectors to get a single representative vector, using [CLS] directly reduces complexity, which is beneficial for both training speed and model inference.\n\n4. **Empirical Performance**: The authors of BERT and subsequent researchers found empirically that using the [CLS] token often leads to strong performance on a wide range of tasks, which reinforced its adoption as a standard approach.\n\n5. **Attention Mechanism**: The self-attention mechanism in BERT allows the [CLS] token to attend to every other token in the sequence. This means it can gather contextual information from the entire sequence, making it a robust representation that potentially captures more than a simple average or max pooling of token vectors.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that alternative methods like averaging, max pooling, or concatenating token vectors can still be beneficial depending on the specific application or dataset. In some cases, these methods might capture nuances that the [CLS] token misses, so experimenting with different approaches can be valuable depending on your needs."
