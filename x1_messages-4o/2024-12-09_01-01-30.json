        "content": "The computational cost of using the `len()` function in Python varies depending on the type of the built-in data structure:\n\n1. **List**: The `len()` function for lists in Python has a time complexity of O(1). This is because the length of a list is stored as an attribute, so retrieving it is a constant-time operation.\n\n2. **Tuple**: Similar to lists, the `len()` function for tuples also has a time complexity of O(1). The length is stored as an attribute, allowing for quick access.\n\n3. **String**: The `len()` function for strings has a time complexity of O(1) as well. The length of a string is stored as part of its internal representation, so it can be accessed in constant time.\n\n4. **Dictionary**: The `len()` function for dictionaries also has a time complexity of O(1). Like the other types, the length of a dictionary is stored as an attribute, making it quick to retrieve.\n\nIn summary, the `len()` function operates in constant time, O(1), for all of these built-in data structures in Python."
