Along with their average weight, could you also mention whether they have a backbone or not? We have an SQL database with a table named \"animals\" that contains the following columns: \"species\", \"backbone\", and \"weight\". This table indicates whether an animal is a vertebrate or an invertebrate and also shows its average weight in grams. We would appreciate a detailed classification of the Squirrel species in our database based on these attributes."

        "content": "To provide a comprehensive breakdown of the Squirrel species in your SQL database, you can execute an SQL query to extract the relevant data. Here's a step-by-step guide along with an example SQL query:\n\n### Step 1: Access the Database\nEnsure you have access to the SQL database where the \"animals\" table is stored. You will need appropriate permissions to execute queries.\n\n### Step 2: Construct the SQL Query\nYou need to write a query that filters the records for Squirrel species and retrieves the relevant columns: \"species\", \"backbone\", and \"weight\".\n\n### Example SQL Query\n\n```sql\nSELECT species, backbone, weight\nFROM animals\nWHERE species LIKE '%Squirrel%';\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Query\n- **SELECT species, backbone, weight**: This part of the query specifies that you want to retrieve the \"species\", \"backbone\", and \"weight\" columns.\n- **FROM animals**: This indicates the table from which to retrieve the data.\n- **WHERE species LIKE '%Squirrel%'**: This condition filters the records to include only those species that contain the word \"Squirrel\". The '%' wildcard allows for any characters to precede or follow \"Squirrel\".\n\n### Expected Result\nThe query will return a list of Squirrel species available in your database, along with their average weight and whether they have a backbone (vertebrate or invertebrate). The \"backbone\" column will typically contain values indicating if the species is a vertebrate (e.g., 'Yes' or 'No').\n\n### Example Output\n```\n| Species          | Backbone | Weight |\n|------------------|----------|--------|\n| Eastern Gray Squirrel   | Yes      | 500    |\n| Red Squirrel            | Yes      | 300    |\n| Fox Squirrel            | Yes      | 800    |\n```\n\n### Classification\n- **Vertebrate/Invertebrate**: Based on the \"backbone\" column, we classify Squirrels as vertebrates because they possess a backbone.\n- **Average Weight**: The weight values will give you an idea of the average weight for each Squirrel species in grams.\n\n### Note\nEnsure that the species names in your database align with common names for Squirrels to effectively use the LIKE clause. If species names vary, you may need to adjust the query accordingly."
