        "content": "Internal combustion engines (ICE) are used in a variety of devices and machinery. Here are some examples:\n\n1. **Automobiles**: Most cars and trucks use internal combustion engines, typically fueled by gasoline or diesel.\n\n2. **Motorcycles**: These two-wheeled vehicles commonly use internal combustion engines for propulsion.\n\n3. **Airplanes**: Many airplanes, especially smaller ones, use piston engines which are a type of internal combustion engine.\n\n4. **Boats**: Internal combustion engines are used in many types of watercraft, including speedboats and some larger ships.\n\n5. **Lawnmowers**: Many lawnmowers are powered by small internal combustion engines.\n\n6. **Chainsaws**: These portable saws typically use small internal combustion engines.\n\n7. **Generators**: Portable generators often use internal combustion engines to produce electricity.\n\n8. **Snowmobiles**: These vehicles, designed for snow travel, typically use internal combustion engines.\n\n9. **ATVs (All-Terrain Vehicles)**: Many ATVs are powered by internal combustion engines.\n\n10. **Construction Equipment**: Bulldozers, excavators, and other heavy machinery often use internal combustion engines.\n\n11. **Tractors and Agricultural Machinery**: Many types of farming equipment use internal combustion engines for various tasks.\n\n12. **Go-Karts**: These small racing vehicles often use internal combustion engines.\n\n13. **Jetskis and Personal Watercraft**: These are typically powered by internal combustion engines.\n\nThese engines are popular due to their power density and versatility, although there is a growing trend towards electrification to reduce emissions and reliance on fossil fuels."
