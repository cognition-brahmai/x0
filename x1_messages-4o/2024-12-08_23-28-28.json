        "content": "To create an HTML page that displays the results of your Python analysis on a global warming dataset, you'll need to follow a series of steps. These steps include performing the analysis in Python, generating visualizations, and then embedding those visualizations into an HTML page.\n\n### Step 1: Perform Data Analysis in Python\n\nPerform your data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and hypothesis testing using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Here is an example of how you might perform some of these tasks:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Load the dataset\ndata = pd.read_csv('global_warming_data.csv')\n\n# Data cleaning\ndata.dropna(inplace=True)\n\n# Exploratory Data Analysis\n# Plotting temperature over the years\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.lineplot(x='Year', y='Temperature', data=data)\nplt.title('Global Temperature Over Time')\nplt.savefig('temperature_plot.png')\n\n# Hypothesis testing example\n# Assume we are testing if CO2 levels have a significant effect on temperature\nfrom scipy.stats import linregress\n\nslope, intercept, r_value, p_value, std_err = linregress(data['CO2'], data['Temperature'])\nprint(f\"P-value: {p_value}\")\n\n# Save the result\nwith open('results.txt', 'w') as f:\n    f.write(f\"P-value: {p_value}\\n\")\n    f.write(f\"Slope: {slope}\\n\")\n    f.write(f\"Intercept: {intercept}\\n\")\n```\n\n### Step 2: Create the HTML Page\n\nOnce you have your analysis and visualizations ready, you can create an HTML page to display these results. The HTML code can include images for your plots and text for your findings.\n\nHere's a simple HTML template:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Global Warming Analysis</title>\n    <style>\n        body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 20px; }\n        .container { max-width: 800px; margin: auto; }\n        img { max-width: 100%; height: auto; }\n        h1, h2 { text-align: center; }\n        p { text-align: justify; }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <h1>Global Warming Analysis</h1>\n        <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>\n        <img src=\"temperature_plot.png\" alt=\"Global Temperature Over Time\">\n        <p>\n            The above plot shows the global temperature trend over the past century. It is evident that temperatures have been rising at an alarming rate.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Hypothesis Testing</h2>\n        <p>\n            Based on our analysis, we conducted a hypothesis test to determine the relationship between carbon dioxide levels and temperature. The results are as follows:\n        </p>\n        <pre>\n            <!-- Assuming you put the results from the text file here -->\n            P-value: <!-- Your P-value here -->\n            Slope: <!-- Your slope value here -->\n            Intercept: <!-- Your intercept value here -->\n        </pre>\n        <p>\n            The low p-value indicates that there is a statistically significant relationship between CO2 levels and temperature.\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Step 3: Host the HTML Page\n\nTo view your HTML page, you can simply open it in a web browser. If you want others to access it, consider hosting it on a web server or using platforms like GitHub Pages.\n\n### Notes\n\n- Ensure that your images and text files are in the same directory as your HTML file or provide the correct path.\n- Customize the HTML and CSS as needed to better fit your analysis and presentation style.\n- For interactive visualizations, consider using libraries like Plotly or Bokeh, which can generate HTML components directly from Python."
