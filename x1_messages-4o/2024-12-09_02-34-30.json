I am using the command `gocr -i /tmp/scanned2.jpg -m 2 -p /home/marc/.db/ -m 256 -m 130` to train it, and `gocr -i /tmp/scanned2.jpg -m 2 -p /home/marc/.db/ -m 256` to reuse the database. After training, the results were fine, but on reusing the database, the OCR doesn't seem to recognize many of the things I trained it with. Shouldn't it at least produce a result that is the same as the result that I got when I trained it? I am using Linux Mint 3.16.0-38, and have installed GOCR via apt-get and have the latest version."

        "content": "It seems like you're encountering issues with the persistence of your training data when using GOCR. Here are a few things you can check and try to resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Check File Permissions**: Ensure that the directory `/home/marc/.db/` and its contents have the correct read and write permissions. The OCR process might not be able to access or update the database files correctly if permissions are restricted.\n\n2. **Database Path**: Double-check the path to the database you are specifying with the `-p` option. Make sure it's correctly pointing to where your training data is stored.\n\n3. **Consistent Options**: Ensure that you are using consistent options in both the training and recognition phases. The options specified during training should match those during recognition to ensure the same parameters are being applied.\n\n4. **Database Overwriting**: Check if the database is being overwritten or cleared after training. Some configurations or scripts might unintentionally reset the database.\n\n5. **Database Content**: Inspect the contents of the database directory to see if files are being generated or modified after training. This can provide insight into whether the training data is being saved correctly.\n\n6. **Correct Usage of Modes**: Make sure you are using the modes (`-m`) appropriately. Different modes can change how the OCR engine processes the image and utilizes the database.\n\n7. **Log Output**: Enable verbose output or logging if available, to see if there are any warnings or errors that might indicate what is going wrong during the reuse phase.\n\n8. **Check Version and Updates**: Even though you mentioned using the latest version, confirm if there are any recent patches or updates that address this specific issue by checking the project repository or forums.\n\n9. **Alternative OCR Engines**: If the issue persists, you might want to consider trying alternative OCR engines like Tesseract, which might offer more robust training and recognition capabilities.\n\nBy systematically checking these areas, you should be able to identify the cause of the issue. If the problem continues, consider reaching out to the GOCR community or forums for more specific troubleshooting related to your version and setup."
