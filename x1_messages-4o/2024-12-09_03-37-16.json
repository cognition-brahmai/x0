While I know there's a built-in method to check if a string ends with a particular substring, like \".txt\", as shown below:\n\n```python\nif file_string.endswith(\".txt\"):\n```\n\nI'm unable to find a similar method to check if a string begins with a specific substring. I'm trying to use a method that would look similar to this:\n\n```python\nif file_string.beginswith(\"begin_like_this\"):\n```\nBut I can't find one. Is there a built-in method in Python to check this?"

        "content": "Yes, Python provides a built-in method to check if a string starts with a specific substring. Instead of `beginswith`, you should use the `startswith` method. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nif file_string.startswith(\"begin_like_this\"):\n    # Your code here\n```\n\nThe `startswith` method is the correct method to use in this scenario and works similarly to `endswith`. It returns `True` if the string starts with the specified prefix, otherwise it returns `False`. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nfile_string = \"begin_like_this_is_a_test_string\"\n\nif file_string.startswith(\"begin_like_this\"):\n    print(\"The string begins with 'begin_like_this'.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The string does not begin with 'begin_like_this'.\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nThe string begins with 'begin_like_this'.\n```"
