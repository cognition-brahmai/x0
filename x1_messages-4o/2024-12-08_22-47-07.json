Below is a simple C++ program that takes input for the taste, texture, and country of origin of bitter chocolate and outputs these attributes in three words.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n\nint main() {\n    std::string taste;\n    std::string texture;\n    std::string country;\n\n    std::cout << \"Enter the taste of the bitter chocolate: \";\n    std::getline(std::cin, taste);\n\n    std::cout << \"Enter the texture of the bitter chocolate: \";\n    std::getline(std::cin, texture);\n\n    std::cout << \"Enter the country of origin for the cocoa beans: \";\n    std::getline(std::cin, country);\n\n    std::cout << \"\\nChocolate Description in Three Words:\\n\";\n    std::cout << taste << \", \" << texture << \", \" << country << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### How to Use the Program:\n\n1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler, like `g++`:\n\n   ```\n   g++ -o chocolate_description chocolate_description.cpp\n   ```\n\n2. Run the compiled program:\n\n   ```\n   ./chocolate_description\n   ```\n\n3. Follow the prompts to input the taste, texture, and country of origin.\n\n4. The program will output the description of the chocolate in three words."
