        "content": "To optimize the nested loops in your code, you can take advantage of NumPy's vectorized operations. This allows you to perform operations on entire arrays without explicit loops, making the code more efficient and concise. Here's how you can refactor your code:\n\n1. **Vectorize the distance calculation**: Instead of calculating the Euclidean distance in a loop, you can use NumPy's broadcasting to compute the distance for all points at once.\n\n2. **Use boolean indexing**: Create a boolean mask based on the distance condition and then update the mask array accordingly.\n\nHere's a vectorized version of your function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.spatial import distance\n\ndef _make_mask(volume_shape, roi, radius):\n    # Create a grid of indices for the volume\n    x = np.arange(volume_shape[0])[:, None, None]\n    y = np.arange(volume_shape[1])[None, :, None]\n    z = np.arange(volume_shape[2])[None, None, :]\n    \n    # Calculate the squared Euclidean distance for all points\n    dist_sq = (x - roi[0])**2 + (y - roi[1])**2 + (z - roi[2])**2\n    \n    # Create the mask by checking if the distance is less than the radius squared\n    mask = dist_sq < radius**2\n    \n    return mask.astype(int)\n\n# Example usage\nvolume_shape = (182, 218, 200)\nroi = np.array([90, 109, 100])  # Example ROI\nradius = 10\nmask = _make_mask(volume_shape, roi, radius)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Broadcasting**: Using NumPy's broadcasting, we create three arrays `x`, `y`, `z` that represent the coordinates of all points in the volume. \n\n2. **Efficient distance calculation**: Instead of using `distance.euclidean`, we compute the squared distance directly, which avoids taking the square root and is numerically faster.\n\n3. **Boolean mask**: We create a boolean mask where each position is `True` if the squared distance is less than `radius**2`. This is then converted to an integer mask using `astype(int)`.\n\nThis approach should significantly speed up your mask creation by leveraging NumPy's optimized array operations."
