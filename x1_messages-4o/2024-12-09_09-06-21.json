        "content": "Creating a CSS animation that changes the size of an element multiple times can be achieved using keyframes to define the animation steps and applying this animation to the desired element. Here's a step-by-step guide along with an example:\n\n1. **Define Keyframes**: Use the `@keyframes` rule to create an animation sequence. You can specify the percentage or keywords (`from`, `to`) to indicate points in the animation timeline.\n\n2. **Apply Animation**: Use properties like `animation-name`, `animation-duration`, `animation-timing-function`, `animation-iteration-count`, and others to control the animation.\n\nHere's an example of a CSS animation that changes the size of an element three times:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Size Change Animation</title>\n    <style>\n        /* Define the animation */\n        @keyframes resize {\n            0% {\n                transform: scale(1);\n            }\n            25% {\n                transform: scale(1.5);\n            }\n            50% {\n                transform: scale(1);\n            }\n            75% {\n                transform: scale(2);\n            }\n            100% {\n                transform: scale(1);\n            }\n        }\n\n        /* Apply the animation to the element */\n        .animated-box {\n            width: 100px;\n            height: 100px;\n            background-color: skyblue;\n            animation-name: resize;\n            animation-duration: 4s; /* Duration of the animation cycle */\n            animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;\n            animation-iteration-count: infinite; /* Repeat the animation indefinitely */\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div class=\"animated-box\"></div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Keyframes**: The `@keyframes resize` rule defines the animation steps. The element starts at its original size (`scale(1)`), grows to 1.5 times its size at 25%, returns to original size at 50%, grows to double its size at 75%, and returns to original size at 100%.\n\n- **Animation Properties**:\n  - `animation-name: resize;` specifies the name of the keyframe animation.\n  - `animation-duration: 4s;` sets the duration of one cycle of the animation to 4 seconds.\n  - `animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;` provides a smooth transition between the keyframes.\n  - `animation-iteration-count: infinite;` makes the animation repeat indefinitely.\n\nYou can adjust the scale values, durations, and timing functions to suit your needs."
