I am trying to draw a standard 2D line graph with pylot, but I want the axes' values to be between 0 and 600 on the x-axis, and between 10k and 20k on the y-axis. Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nimport pylab as p\n\np.title(save_file)\np.axis([0.0,600.0,1000000.0,2000000.0])\n\n#define keys and items elsewhere..\np.plot(keys,items)\np.savefig(save_file, dpi=100)\n```\n\nHowever, the axes still adjust to the size of the data. I interpret the effect of p.axis as setting what the max and min could be, not enforcing them to be the max or min. The same happens when I try to use p.xlim() etc."

        "content": "To enforce specific axis ranges in Matplotlib using Pyplot, you need to use `p.xlim()` and `p.ylim()` functions to explicitly set the axis limits. In your case, you want to set the x-axis to range from 0 to 600 and the y-axis to range from 10,000 to 20,000. You can modify your code as follows:\n\n```python\nimport pylab as p\n\n# Set the title of the plot\np.title(\"Your Plot Title\")\n\n# Set x-axis limits from 0 to 600\np.xlim(0, 600)\n\n# Set y-axis limits from 10,000 to 20,000\np.ylim(10000, 20000)\n\n# Assuming keys and items are defined elsewhere\np.plot(keys, items)\n\n# Save the figure with the specified dpi\np.savefig(\"your_save_file.png\", dpi=100)\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `\"Your Plot Title\"` and `\"your_save_file.png\"` with your desired title and file name.\n\nBy using `p.xlim()` and `p.ylim()`, you are directly setting the range of the axes, and Matplotlib will enforce these limits regardless of the data being plotted. This should resolve the issue you're facing."
