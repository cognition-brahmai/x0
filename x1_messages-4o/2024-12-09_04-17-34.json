How can I ensure that it stays running for Nginx to connect to, and it restarts if it crashes? Currently, I am running Gunicorn as shown in the documentation:\n\n```python\ngunicorn app:app\n```\n\nHowever, when I logout of the server, the Gunicorn process exits."

        "content": "To ensure that Gunicorn continues to run even after logging out of the server and can automatically restart if it crashes, you can use a process manager. Two popular options for this purpose are **systemd** and **supervisor**. Here's how you can set up each:\n\n### Using Systemd\n\n1. **Create a Systemd Service File:**\n   - Create a new service file for your Flask application, typically located in `/etc/systemd/system/`. You can name it `myapp.service`.\n\n   ```ini\n   [Unit]\n   Description=Gunicorn instance to serve my Flask app\n   After=network.target\n\n   [Service]\n   User=your_user\n   Group=your_group\n   WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/app\n   ExecStart=/path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/gunicorn --workers 3 --bind unix:myapp.sock -m 007 wsgi:app\n\n   [Install]\n   WantedBy=multi-user.target\n   ```\n\n   Replace `your_user`, `your_group`, `/path/to/your/app`, and `/path/to/your/virtualenv` with your actual username, group, application directory, and virtual environment path respectively.\n\n2. **Start and Enable the Service:**\n   - Reload the systemd daemon to recognize the new service file:\n\n     ```bash\n     sudo systemctl daemon-reload\n     ```\n\n   - Start the service:\n\n     ```bash\n     sudo systemctl start myapp\n     ```\n\n   - Enable the service to start on boot:\n\n     ```bash\n     sudo systemctl enable myapp\n     ```\n\n3. **Managing the Service:**\n   - You can manage your application with systemd using commands like `start`, `stop`, `restart`, and `status`:\n\n     ```bash\n     sudo systemctl status myapp  # Check the status\n     sudo systemctl restart myapp # Restart the service\n     ```\n\n### Using Supervisor\n\n1. **Install Supervisor:**\n   - If not already installed, you can install Supervisor using your package manager. For Ubuntu, you can use:\n\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt-get install supervisor\n     ```\n\n2. **Create a Supervisor Configuration File:**\n   - Create a configuration file for your app in `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/` directory, for example, `myapp.conf`.\n\n   ```ini\n   [program:myapp]\n   command=/path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/gunicorn --workers 3 --bind unix:/path/to/your/app/myapp.sock -m 007 wsgi:app\n   directory=/path/to/your/app\n   user=your_user\n   autostart=true\n   autorestart=true\n   stopasgroup=true\n   killasgroup=true\n   ```\n\n   Replace `/path/to/your/virtualenv`, `/path/to/your/app`, `your_user` with your actual paths and username.\n\n3. **Update Supervisor and Start Your Program:**\n   - Update Supervisor to recognize the new configuration:\n\n     ```bash\n     sudo supervisorctl reread\n     sudo supervisorctl update\n     ```\n\n   - Start your application using Supervisor:\n\n     ```bash\n     sudo supervisorctl start myapp\n     ```\n\n4. **Managing Your Program:**\n   - Similar to systemd, Supervisor allows you to control your application with commands like `start`, `stop`, and `restart`:\n\n     ```bash\n     sudo supervisorctl status myapp   # Check the status\n     sudo supervisorctl restart myapp  # Restart the application\n     ```\n\nBy using either systemd or Supervisor, you can ensure Gunicorn runs continuously, restarts automatically if it crashes, and stays running even after you logout of the server."
