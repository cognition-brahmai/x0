I'm pulling data out of a Google Doc, processing it, and then writing it to a file that will eventually be used in a Wordpress page. The data contains non-ASCII symbols, and I'm having trouble converting these to symbols that can be used in HTML source. I'm currently converting everything to Unicode on input, joining it all together in a Python string, and writing to a file using the following code:\n\n```python\nimport codecs\nf = codecs.open('out.txt', mode=\"w\", encoding=\"iso-8859-1\")\nf.write(all_html.encode(\"iso-8859-1\", \"replace\"))\n```\n\nHowever, I get a UnicodeDecodeError on the last line that says: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xa0 in position 12286: ordinal not in range(128). I've attempted a partial solution that runs without error, but when I open the resulting text file, I see lots of unwanted symbols like `Qur\u201a\u00c4\u00f4an`. Here's the partial solution code:\n\n```python\nrow = [unicode(x.strip()) if x is not None else u'' for x in row]\nall_html = row[0] + \"<br/>\" + row[1]\nf = open('out.txt', 'w')\nf.write(all_html.encode(\"utf-8\"))\n```\n\nHow can I correctly write Unicode text to a file?"

        "content": "To correctly write Unicode text to a file in Python, especially when dealing with non-ASCII characters, you should use UTF-8 encoding. This encoding can handle all Unicode characters and is widely used for web content, including HTML files.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to help you achieve this:\n\n1. Read and process your data using Unicode strings.\n2. Ensure your data is in Unicode format before writing it to the file.\n3. Open the output file with UTF-8 encoding and write the Unicode content directly.\n\nHere's an updated version of your code that should work without raising errors and produce the desired output:\n\n```python\n# Open the file with UTF-8 encoding\nwith open('out.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n    # Process your row data\n    row = [str(x.strip()) if x is not None else '' for x in row]\n    \n    # Join your HTML content\n    all_html = row[0] + \"<br/>\" + row[1]\n    \n    # Write the Unicode content to the file\n    f.write(all_html)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Use UTF-8 Encoding**: Opening the file with `encoding='utf-8'` ensures that you can write any Unicode text without encountering encoding issues.\n- **Use `with` Statement**: This ensures the file is properly closed after writing, even if an error occurs during the process.\n- **Proper String Conversion**: Use `str()` to ensure all elements are converted to strings. This is necessary if your `row` list contains `None` values or any non-string data types.\n\nBy using these practices, you should be able to write your Unicode content correctly to a file, which can then be used in your WordPress page without unwanted symbols."
