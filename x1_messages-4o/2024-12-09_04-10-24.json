I've read that `setup.py` is designed for redistributable things while `requirements.txt` is for non-redistributable things, but I'm not entirely sure if this information is accurate. Could someone clarify the intended use of these two files?"

        "content": "Certainly, the distinction between `requirements.txt` and `setup.py` is an important aspect of managing dependencies in Python projects. Here's a breakdown of their intended purposes:\n\n1. **`requirements.txt`:**\n   - This file is typically used to specify the exact versions of packages needed to run a project. It is primarily used for setting up the environment for development or deployment.\n   - It is non-redistributable in the sense that it is not meant for packaging and distributing a Python library. Instead, it's used to recreate a working environment with all necessary dependencies installed at specific versions.\n   - A common use case for `requirements.txt` is to freeze the current environment with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`, which captures the exact package versions currently installed in your environment.\n\n2. **`setup.py`:**\n   - This is a script for packaging and distributing Python projects. It provides metadata about your project and specifies dependencies that need to be installed for your package to work.\n   - `setup.py` is used when you want to distribute your project as a library or a standalone package that others can install using `pip`.\n   - It is redistributable because it outlines how the package should be built and what dependencies should be installed, but it typically does not specify exact versions unless necessary. This allows for more flexibility in satisfying dependencies.\n\nIn summary, use `requirements.txt` to lock down the environment for development and deployment, ensuring consistent setups across different machines. Use `setup.py` to distribute your package, specifying the dependencies needed for it to function but leaving room for flexibility in versioning."
