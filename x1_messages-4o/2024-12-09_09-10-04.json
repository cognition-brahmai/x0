Here's a JavaScript function that calculates the factorial of a given number:\n\n```javascript\nfunction factorial(n) {\n    if (n < 0) {\n        return \"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\";\n    }\n    let result = 1;\n    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\n        result *= i;\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconsole.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120\n```\n\nThis function checks if the input number is negative, as factorials are not defined for negative numbers. It then calculates the factorial by multiplying each integer from 1 up to `n`. You can call this function with any non-negative integer to get its factorial."
