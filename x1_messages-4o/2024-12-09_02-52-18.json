However, my program crashes when an exception is raised and I'm trying to make it continue even after encountering an exception. Currently, after a couple of seconds, I receive the following error: 'error <type 'exceptions.IOError'>'. Here's my code:\n\n```python\nimport os \npath = 'Y:\\\\Files\\\\'\nlisting = os.listdir(path)\ntry:\n    for infile in listing:\n        if infile.startswith(\"ABC\"):\n            fo = open(infile,\"r\")\n            for line in fo:\n                if line.startswith(\"REVIEW\"):\n                    print infile\n            fo.close()\nexcept:\n    print \"error \"+str(IOError)\n    pass\n```\n\nHow can I make my Python program continue after encountering an exception?"

        "content": "To ensure your program continues execution even after encountering an exception, particularly when processing multiple files, you should handle exceptions on a per-file basis within the loop. You can achieve this by placing the `try-except` block inside the loop. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\npath = 'Y:\\\\Files\\\\'\nlisting = os.listdir(path)\n\nfor infile in listing:\n    if infile.startswith(\"ABC\"):\n        try:\n            with open(os.path.join(path, infile), \"r\") as fo:\n                for line in fo:\n                    if line.startswith(\"REVIEW\"):\n                        print(infile)\n        except IOError as e:\n            print(f\"Error processing file {infile}: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n1. **Exception Handling Inside the Loop**: The `try-except` block is now inside the loop, so if an exception occurs while processing one file, it won't affect the processing of the other files.\n\n2. **Using `with` Statement**: The `with` statement is used to open files, which automatically handles closing the file even if an error occurs. This is considered a best practice for file handling in Python.\n\n3. **More Informative Error Message**: The error message now includes the specific file that caused the error and the exception message itself, making it easier to debug issues.\n\n4. **Joining Path and Filename**: The `os.path.join(path, infile)` is used to ensure the correct file path is used when opening the file.\n\nThis approach ensures that your program will continue processing other files even if an error occurs with one of them."
