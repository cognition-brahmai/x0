        "content": "To find the sum of all even numbers in an array using JavaScript, you can utilize the `reduce` method along with the `filter` method. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n```javascript\nfunction sumOfEvenNumbers(array) {\n  return array\n    .filter(number => number % 2 === 0) // Filter out even numbers\n    .reduce((sum, number) => sum + number, 0); // Sum up the even numbers\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];\nconst sumEven = sumOfEvenNumbers(numbers);\n\nconsole.log(sumEven); // Output: 30\n```\n\nHere's what the code does:\n\n1. **Filter**: The `filter` method creates a new array with only the even numbers from the original array. It uses the condition `number % 2 === 0` to check for even numbers.\n\n2. **Reduce**: The `reduce` method iterates over the filtered array and accumulates the sum of its elements. It starts with an initial value of `0`.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the sum of all even numbers in the given array."
