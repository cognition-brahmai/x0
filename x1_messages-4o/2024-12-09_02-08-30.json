So, I can create my metaclass as follows:\n\n```python\ndef metacls(clsName, bases, atts):\n    ....\n    return type(clsName, bases, atts)\n```\n\nHowever, I often see people write their metaclasses like this:\n\n```python\nclass Metacls(type):\n    def __new__(meta, clsName, bases, atts):\n        ....\n        return type.__new__(meta, clsName, bases, atts)\n```\n\nAs far as I can tell, these two methods essentially accomplish the same task. Is there a specific reason to use the base class instead? Is it a common practice?"

        "content": "Yes, it is customary to inherit from `type` when defining metaclasses in Python, even though any callable can technically serve as a metaclass. Here are some reasons why inheriting from `type` is common and considered good practice:\n\n1. **Consistency and Readability**: Inheriting from `type` makes it clear to anyone reading your code that the class is intended to be a metaclass. It follows the convention used in the Python standard library and most third-party libraries, aiding in code readability and understanding.\n\n2. **Access to `type` Methods**: By inheriting from `type`, you gain access to its methods and can override them as needed. This includes methods like `__new__`, `__init__`, and `__call__`, which can be useful when customizing how classes are created.\n\n3. **Customization**: Using a class-based metaclass allows you to define additional methods and maintain state across multiple class definitions if needed. This is more challenging to achieve with a function-based metaclass.\n\n4. **Future Extensibility**: A class-based metaclass can easily be extended in the future if additional functionality is needed. This flexibility makes it a more robust choice in the long run.\n\n5. **Common Practice**: Since inheriting from `type` is the standard approach, it is more likely to be understood and maintained by other developers, aligning with the principle of least surprise.\n\nWhile both approaches can achieve similar results, using a class-based approach by inheriting from `type` leverages Python's object-oriented features more effectively and aligns with common practices in the Python community."
