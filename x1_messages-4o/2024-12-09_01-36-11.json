I wrote a unit test for this module with an assert statement to check for list equality. The class is first instantiated with a list, then a method is invoked from the class. Both my test.py and the script to be tested are in the same directory. However, when I run 'pytest', it exits with no error, but it also states \"collected 0 items\". I've also tried running 'pytest' examples but with no success. What could be the issue here? I'm using Python version 3.5.1 and pytest version 2.8.1 on Windows 7. Below is my test.py code:\n\n```python\nfrom sort_algos import Sorts\n\ndef integer_sort_test():\n    myobject1 = Sorts([-100, 10, -10])\n    assert myobject1.merge_sort() == [-101, -100, 10]\n```\n\nIn this code, sort_algos.py is a module with a class 'Sorts'. 'merge_sort' is a method under 'Sorts'."

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing with pytest not collecting any tests is likely due to the naming conventions that pytest uses to discover test functions and modules. Let's address a few key areas to ensure your tests are properly collected and executed by pytest:\n\n1. **Naming Conventions**: \n   - Pytest relies on specific naming conventions to automatically discover test files and functions. Test files should be named starting with `test_` or ending with `_test.py`. Similarly, test functions within these files should be prefixed with `test_`.\n   - In your case, rename your function from `integer_sort_test` to `test_integer_sort`.\n\n2. **Proper Assertions**:\n   - Ensure that the assert statement is testing what you expect. In your code, there's a discrepancy in the expected list. If you're testing for sorting, the expected sorted list should be `[-100, -10, 10]`.\n\n3. **Check the Directory and File Structure**:\n   - Double-check that both `test.py` and `sort_algos.py` are indeed in the same directory.\n   - Make sure that you are running `pytest` from the directory that contains `test.py`.\n\n4. **Ensure the Methods are Correct**:\n   - Verify that the `merge_sort` method is implemented correctly in your `Sorts` class and returns the expected result.\n\n5. **Versions and Compatibility**:\n   - Although your versions of Python and pytest are slightly older, the naming conventions and basic usage should still be applicable. However, consider updating to newer versions if possible for improved features and compatibility.\n\nHere's how your updated `test.py` might look:\n\n```python\nfrom sort_algos import Sorts\n\ndef test_integer_sort():\n    myobject1 = Sorts([-100, 10, -10])\n    assert myobject1.merge_sort() == [-100, -10, 10]\n```\n\n6. **Run Pytest**:\n   - With the above changes, run `pytest` again from the command line in the directory containing `test.py`. It should now correctly collect and run the test.\n\nIf you still encounter issues, try running pytest with increased verbosity using the `-v` flag to get more detailed output, which might help diagnose further problems:\n\n```bash\npytest -v\n```\n\nIf needed, you can also use the `--collect-only` option to see which tests pytest is attempting to collect, which can provide additional clues:\n\n```bash\npytest --collect-only\n```"
