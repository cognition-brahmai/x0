How can I modify my code to run without errors in Python2.6.6?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to a difference in how string formatting works between Python 2.6 and Python 2.7. In Python 2.6, the format string requires explicit field numbers, whereas in Python 2.7 and later, you can omit them.\n\nTo make your code compatible with Python 2.6, you need to specify the field index explicitly in the format string. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n':'.join(\"{0:x}\\n\".format(random.randint(0, 2**16 - 1)) for i in range(4))\n```\n\nBy adding `{0:x}` instead of `{:x}`, you explicitly specify the index of the argument in the `format` method, which is necessary in Python 2.6. This should resolve the `ValueError` you are encountering."
