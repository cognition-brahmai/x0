Now, I've added a .cu file to this project and I am attempting to modify the Makefile to compile everything together. However, I am encountering some issues. When I use the \"make\" command in the \"it\" folder, I get multiple errors indicating that the file containing the main() function (it.c in the sourcedir folder) is not getting linked to any of the functions from other libraries. The same issue is also occurring for my .cu file. Can someone help me debug this issue with my Makefile? I've used the following Stackoverflow post as a reference: makefile for C++/CUDA project."

        "content": "Certainly! When integrating both C and CUDA code into a project, the Makefile needs to appropriately handle both types of compilation and linking processes. Let's go through a basic structure to help you debug your Makefile. Here's a template with explanations:\n\n1. **Compiler Definitions**: Define which compiler to use for C and CUDA files.\n\n```makefile\nCC = gcc\nCXX = g++\nNVCC = nvcc\n```\n\n2. **Flags**: Set the necessary compilation and linking flags for C and CUDA.\n\n```makefile\nCFLAGS = -Wall -O2\nNVCCFLAGS = -arch=sm_30 # Adjust the architecture flag as needed\nLDFLAGS = -lcudart\n```\n\n3. **Source and Object Files**: Specify your source files and corresponding object files.\n\n```makefile\nC_SOURCES = $(wildcard sourcedir/*.c)\nCU_SOURCES = $(wildcard sourcedir/*.cu)\nC_OBJS = $(C_SOURCES:.c=.o)\nCU_OBJS = $(CU_SOURCES:.cu=.o)\n```\n\n4. **Target**: Define the target executable and the rules to build it.\n\n```makefile\nTARGET = my_program\n\nall: $(TARGET)\n\n$(TARGET): $(C_OBJS) $(CU_OBJS)\n\t$(CXX) $(C_OBJS) $(CU_OBJS) -o $@ $(LDFLAGS)\n\n%.o: %.c\n\t$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@\n\n%.o: %.cu\n\t$(NVCC) $(NVCCFLAGS) -c $< -o $@\n```\n\n5. **Clean**: Add a rule to clean up object files and the executable.\n\n```makefile\nclean:\n\trm -f $(C_OBJS) $(CU_OBJS) $(TARGET)\n```\n\n6. **Debugging Tips**:\n   - Ensure your `sourcedir` is correctly named and accessible from the Makefile.\n   - Verify that your architecture flag (`-arch=sm_30`) matches the capabilities of your GPU.\n   - Check the linking flags (`-lcudart`) to make sure all necessary libraries are linked.\n   - Use `make VERBOSE=1` to see the exact commands being run for debugging purposes.\n   - If there are undefined references, ensure that all source files are listed and compiled.\n\nThis structure should help in integrating both C and CUDA files in your project. If you encounter specific errors, feel free to share them, and we can further diagnose the issues."
