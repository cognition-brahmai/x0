I have various time series that often cover different periods. I am aware of the numpy methods, but it seems they lack the understanding of the time series nature of my data. When correlating a time series that starts from 1940 with one that starts from 1970, pandas 'corr' seems to understand this, whereas 'np.correlate' just produces an array full of NaN. I am specifically looking for a solution to perform the shift by 12 months in increments of 1, to find the time of maximum correlation within one year. I have tried to implement a time-lag-correlation on my own, but I am looking for a built-in method that is more efficient. \n\nSample data and attempts:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\ndfdates1 = pd.date_range('01/01/1980', '01/01/2000', freq = 'MS')\ndfdata1 = (np.random.randint(-30,30,(len(dfdates1)))/10.0)\ndf1 = pd.DataFrame(dfdata1, index = dfdates1)\n\ndfdates2 = pd.date_range('03/01/1990', '02/01/2013', freq = 'MS')\ndfdata2 = (np.random.randint(-30,30,(len(dfdates2)))/10.0)\ndf2 = pd.DataFrame(dfdata2, index = dfdates2)\n\n# Processing steps\nbigdates = pd.date_range('01/01/1940', '01/01/2015', freq = 'MS')\nbig1 = pd.DataFrame(index = bigdates)\nbig2 = pd.DataFrame(index = bigdates)\nbig1 = pd.concat([big1, df1],axis = 1)\nbig2 = pd.concat([big2, df2],axis = 1)\n\n# Panda's correlation\ncorr_coeff_0 = big1[0].corr(big2[0])\nbig2_shift = big2.shift(1)\ncorr_coeff_1 = big1[0].corr(big2_shift[0])\n\n# Scipy correlation\nscicorr = scipy.signal.correlate(big1,big2,mode=\"full\")\n\n# Attempt to implement time-lag-correlation\ncorr_coeff_0 = df1['Data'].corr(df2['Data'])\ndf1_1month = df1.shift(1)\ncorr_coeff_1 = df1_1month['Data'].corr(df2['Data'])\ndf1_6month = df1.shift(6)\ncorr_coeff_6 = df1_6month['Data'].corr(df2['Data'])\n```"

        "content": "To perform cross-correlation with pandas on multiple time series data and find at which time lag the correlation factor is the greatest, you can create a function that systematically shifts one of the time series and computes the correlation at each lag. This approach leverages pandas' capabilities to handle missing data and align time series with different starting points.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide along with the implementation:\n\n1. **Align your time series data** by creating a common date range that encompasses both series.\n2. **Iterate over the possible time lags** and compute the correlation coefficient for each lag.\n3. **Record the correlation coefficients** and determine the lag with the highest correlation.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create the sample data\ndfdates1 = pd.date_range('01/01/1980', '01/01/2000', freq='MS')\ndfdata1 = (np.random.randint(-30, 30, (len(dfdates1))) / 10.0)\ndf1 = pd.DataFrame(dfdata1, index=dfdates1, columns=['Data'])\n\ndfdates2 = pd.date_range('03/01/1990', '02/01/2013', freq='MS')\ndfdata2 = (np.random.randint(-30, 30, (len(dfdates2))) / 10.0)\ndf2 = pd.DataFrame(dfdata2, index=dfdates2, columns=['Data'])\n\n# Define a function to compute correlation for different time lags\ndef cross_correlation(df1, df2, max_lag=12):\n    correlations = {}\n    for lag in range(0, max_lag + 1):\n        df1_shifted = df1.shift(lag)\n        combined = pd.concat([df1_shifted, df2], axis=1).dropna()\n        corr = combined.iloc[:, 0].corr(combined.iloc[:, 1])\n        correlations[lag] = corr\n    return correlations\n\n# Compute correlations for lags 0 to 12\ncorrelations = cross_correlation(df1, df2, max_lag=12)\n\n# Find the lag with the maximum correlation\nbest_lag = max(correlations, key=correlations.get)\nbest_correlation = correlations[best_lag]\n\nprint(f\"The highest correlation of {best_correlation:.2f} is at a lag of {best_lag} months.\")\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Data Preparation**: Create time series data using pandas `date_range` and `DataFrame`.\n- **Cross-correlation Function**: The `cross_correlation` function takes two dataframes and a maximum lag value. It shifts `df1` by each lag value and calculates the correlation with `df2`.\n- **Iterating Over Lags**: For each lag, the shifted dataframe is concatenated with `df2`, and NaN values are dropped to ensure proper alignment for correlation computation.\n- **Finding the Best Lag**: After computing the correlations for each lag, the maximum correlation and corresponding lag are identified.\n\nThis method should efficiently find the time lag with the highest correlation while respecting the time series nature of your data using pandas' features."
