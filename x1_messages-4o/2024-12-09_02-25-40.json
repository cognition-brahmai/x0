Currently, I am using the `wb.active` to access the active sheet, but I want to access a specific sheet by its name, similar to the `Sheets('Data')` syntax in VBA. Here is my current code:\n```\nfrom openpyxl import load_workbook\n\nwb = load_workbook(filename)\nactive_ws = wb.active\n```"

Here's how you can modify your code to select a specific sheet by its name:\n\n```python\nfrom openpyxl import load_workbook\n\n# Load the workbook\nwb = load_workbook(filename)\n\n# Specify the sheet name you want to access\nsheet_name = 'Data'\n\n# Access the specific sheet by its name\nws = wb[sheet_name]\n\n# Now you can work with the worksheet 'Data'\n```\n\nThis approach will allow you to directly access the sheet named \"Data\" (or any other sheet you specify) and perform any operations you need on it. Make sure that the sheet name you specify exists in the workbook, otherwise, you'll encounter a `KeyError`."
