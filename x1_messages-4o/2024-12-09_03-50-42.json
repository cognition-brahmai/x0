However, when I try to retrieve all the objects using `User.objects.all()`, it doesn't return anything unless I remove the `__init__` function I wrote. Why is this happening and how can I fix it? Here is the `__init__` method I wrote:\n\n```python\ndef __init__(self, name, email, house_id, password):\n    models.Model.__init__(self)\n    self.name = name\n    self.email = email\n```"

        "content": "When you override the `__init__` method in a Django model, you need to ensure that you call the parent class's `__init__` method correctly and also manage the parameters in a way that doesn't interfere with Django's ORM functionality. The issue you're facing is likely due to the fact that the `__init__` method is overriding the default behavior, and thus, the ORM is not being properly initialized for the model instances.\n\nTo fix this, you should structure your `__init__` method to accept both positional and keyword arguments, and then pass the keyword arguments to the parent class's `__init__` method. This will allow the Django ORM to function correctly. Here's how you can modify your `__init__` method:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass User(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    email = models.EmailField()\n    house_id = models.IntegerField()\n    password = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    \n    def __init__(self, name=None, email=None, house_id=None, password=None, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)  # Call the parent class's __init__ method\n        if name is not None:\n            self.name = name\n        if email is not None:\n            self.email = email\n        if house_id is not None:\n            self.house_id = house_id\n        if password is not None:\n            self.password = password\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **super()**: Use `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)` to ensure that the parent class's `__init__` method is called with all necessary arguments, allowing Django to properly initialize the model instance.\n\n2. **Default Parameters**: Use default values for the parameters in your custom `__init__` method to allow for flexibility in object creation. This ensures that the model can still be instantiated by the ORM when querying from the database.\n\n3. **Keyword Arguments**: Always ensure that `*args` and `**kwargs` are passed to the parent's `__init__` method to handle any additional arguments that the ORM might require, especially when retrieving objects from the database.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to create instances of your model using custom initialization logic while still maintaining the ability to interact with the Django ORM as expected."
