Despite the Wikipedia article on determining the number of clusters in a dataset indicating that I do not need to worry about such a problem when using hierarchical clustering, I noticed that I have to feed it the number of clusters as a parameter \"n_clusters\" in scikit-learn's agglomerative clustering. Without specifying this parameter, I get the hardcoded default of two clusters. Is the information in the wiki article incorrect, or is there a method I can use to determine the right number of clusters?"

        "content": "Hierarchical clustering, including agglomerative clustering, can indeed be used to determine the number of clusters in a dataset by examining the dendrogram, which is a tree-like diagram that records the sequences of merges or splits. However, when using scikit-learn's AgglomerativeClustering, you need to specify the number of clusters (`n_clusters`) as it performs the clustering in a \"top-down\" manner from the dendrogram.\n\nThe Wikipedia article might be referring to the conceptual advantage of hierarchical clustering, where you can visually inspect the dendrogram to decide the number of clusters. However, in practice, especially with libraries like scikit-learn, you often need to specify this parameter to get a concrete output of clusters.\n\nHere are some methods to help you determine the right number of clusters:\n\n1. **Dendrogram Analysis**: Use a tool like SciPy's `dendrogram` function to plot the dendrogram. Look for the longest vertical distance that doesn't cross any horizontal line (this is often referred to as the \"elbow\" in the dendrogram). The number of lines, or clusters, that are formed at this point is a good starting point.\n\n2. **Elbow Method**: Similar to k-means, you can use the elbow method here by plotting the linkage distance or within-cluster sum of squares against the number of clusters and looking for a \"knee\" or \"elbow\" in the graph.\n\n3. **Silhouette Score**: Compute the silhouette score for different numbers of clusters. The silhouette score measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. A higher average silhouette score suggests a better clustering.\n\n4. **Cross-Validation**: Although not typical for hierarchical clustering, you can use cross-validation techniques to evaluate the clustering quality for different numbers of clusters.\n\n5. **Domain Knowledge**: Sometimes, domain knowledge can give you an idea of how many clusters there should be.\n\nOnce you have a good estimate of the number of clusters from these methods, you can use that number with `n_clusters` in scikit-learn's AgglomerativeClustering."
