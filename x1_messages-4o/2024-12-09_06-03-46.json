While developing, I successfully installed both using 'apt-get install scipy' which installed SciPy 0.9.0 and NumPy 1.5.1. However, I want to use 'pip install' instead to specify dependencies in a setup.py of my own package. While 'pip install 'numpy==1.5.1'' runs successfully, 'pip install 'scipy==0.9.0'' fails with an error 'numpy.distutils.system_info.BlasNotFoundError: Blas libraries not found'. How can I resolve this?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering typically arises because SciPy relies on certain low-level libraries for numerical computations, such as BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) and LAPACK (Linear Algebra Package). When using `apt-get`, these dependencies are usually handled automatically by the package manager. However, when using `pip`, you may need to manually ensure that these dependencies are installed on your system.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Install BLAS and LAPACK:** You need to ensure that the BLAS and LAPACK libraries are installed on your system. You can do this using your package manager. On Ubuntu or Debian-based systems, you can run:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev\n   ```\n\n   On Fedora or Red Hat-based systems, you can use:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo dnf install blas-devel lapack-devel\n   ```\n\n   On macOS, you can use Homebrew:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew install openblas\n   ```\n\n2. **Use a Virtual Environment:** It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage your Python dependencies. This ensures that your package dependencies do not interfere with other projects. Create and activate a virtual environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n3. **Install NumPy First:** Ensure that NumPy is installed before SciPy, as SciPy depends on it:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install numpy==1.5.1\n   ```\n\n4. **Install SciPy:** Once NumPy is installed, you can then attempt to install SciPy:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install scipy==0.9.0\n   ```\n\n5. **Alternative Approach:** If you still encounter issues, consider using an older version of a package that includes pre-built wheels for your platform. Alternatively, try using the latest versions of NumPy and SciPy, as they may have better support and pre-built wheels that eliminate the need for manual library installations.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the BLAS/LAPACK dependency issue when installing SciPy using `pip`."
