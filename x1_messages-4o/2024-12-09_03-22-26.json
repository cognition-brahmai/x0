The number of rows is simply the length of the outer list, and the number of columns is the length of the first element (assuming all rows have the same number of columns).\n\nHere is how you can do it for your example:\n\n```python\nInput = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]\n\n# Number of rows\nnum_rows = len(Input)\n\n# Number of columns\nnum_columns = len(Input[0]) if num_rows > 0 else 0\n\nprint(f\"Number of rows: {num_rows}\")\nprint(f\"Number of columns: {num_columns}\")\n```\n\nFor your `Input` array, this will output:\n\n```\nNumber of rows: 3\nNumber of columns: 2\n```\n\nThis approach assumes that the 2D array is well-formed, meaning each sublist (representing a row) has the same number of elements (representing columns)."
