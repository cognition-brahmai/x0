        "content": "To solve this puzzle using Python, we need to map the tropical fruits to numerical values to satisfy the mathematical relationships between the favorite fruits of the animals. Let's assume each tropical fruit has a unique numerical value, which could be a representation of their sweetness, size, or any other attribute. \n\nWe'll assign hypothetical numbers to the tropical fruits and solve the equations based on the given conditions:\n\n1. Lion's favorite fruit = Tiger's favorite fruit + Bear's favorite fruit\n2. Tiger's favorite fruit = Bear's favorite fruit + 3\n3. Monkey's favorite fruit = 1/3 * Lion's favorite fruit\n\nHere's a possible implementation:\n\n```python\n# Assign hypothetical numerical values to the tropical fruits\nfruit_values = {\n    \"mango\": 9,\n    \"pineapple\": 6,\n    \"papaya\": 3,\n    \"guava\": 12\n}\n\n# Define the zoo dictionary\nzoo = {\n    \"lion\": \"\",\n    \"tiger\": \"\",\n    \"bear\": \"\",\n    \"monkey\": \"\"\n}\n\ndef is_tropical(fruit):\n    tropical_fruits = [\"mango\", \"pineapple\", \"papaya\", \"guava\"]\n    return fruit in tropical_fruits\n\n# Iterate over possible combinations of fruits for bear, tiger, and lion\nfor bear_fruit in fruit_values:\n    for tiger_fruit in fruit_values:\n        if tiger_fruit == bear_fruit:\n            continue\n        for lion_fruit in fruit_values:\n            if lion_fruit in (bear_fruit, tiger_fruit):\n                continue\n            \n            # Calculate numerical values for the fruits\n            bear_value = fruit_values[bear_fruit]\n            tiger_value = fruit_values[tiger_fruit]\n            lion_value = fruit_values[lion_fruit]\n            \n            # Calculate monkey's fruit value\n            monkey_value = lion_value / 3\n            \n            # Check if the conditions are satisfied\n            if lion_value == tiger_value + bear_value and tiger_value == bear_value + 3:\n                # Find the tropical fruit corresponding to monkey's value\n                for fruit, value in fruit_values.items():\n                    if value == monkey_value:\n                        monkey_fruit = fruit\n                        break\n                else:\n                    continue\n                \n                # Assign the fruits to the zoo dictionary\n                zoo[\"lion\"] = lion_fruit\n                zoo[\"tiger\"] = tiger_fruit\n                zoo[\"bear\"] = bear_fruit\n                zoo[\"monkey\"] = monkey_fruit\n                break\n        if zoo[\"lion\"]:\n            break\n    if zoo[\"bear\"]:\n        break\n\nprint(zoo)\n```\n\nIn this example, the tropical fruits are assigned numerical values that could represent a qualitative measure allowing the logic to work. You can adjust these values according to your assumptions or requirements. The code will find a combination of fruits that satisfies the mathematical relationships described in the puzzle."
