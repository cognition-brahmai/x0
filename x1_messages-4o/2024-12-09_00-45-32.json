Is this possible using the requests library?"

        "content": "Yes, you can make a DELETE request using the `requests` library in Python. The library provides a straightforward way to perform HTTP requests, including DELETE requests. Here's how you can modify your code to perform a DELETE request:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth\nimport json\n\n# Set up your URL, replacing 'data_description' with the appropriate endpoint\nurl = \"https://www.toggl.com/api/v6/\" + data_description + \".json\"\n\n# Define the headers, if necessary\nheaders = {'content-type': 'application/json'}\n\n# Make the DELETE request\nresponse = requests.delete(url, headers=headers, auth=HTTPBasicAuth(toggl_token, 'api_token'))\n\n# Check the response\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    print(\"Delete successful\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Failed to delete, status code: {response.status_code}\")\n    print(response.text)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- You use `requests.delete()` to make a DELETE request.\n- The `url` should be the endpoint you want to send the DELETE request to.\n- You can include headers if needed. For many APIs, you may not need to include a payload with a DELETE request, but if your API requires additional data, you would include it similarly to how you do in a POST request.\n- The `auth` parameter is used to pass authentication credentials, in this case, using basic authentication with your `toggl_token`.\n\nAlways make sure to check the API documentation for Toggl to ensure you are using the correct endpoint and passing any required parameters."
