        "content": "I am encountering a \"fatal error: ffi.h: No such file or directory\" when trying to install pyOpenSSL using pip2. I am doing this as part of installing/building my Ansible agent on target nodes, which is a requirement to use the standard Ansible module for creating self-signed certificates (openssl_certificate). However, this method is no longer working. I have reproduced the issue as follows:\n\n```shell\nvagrant init generic/ubuntu1804\nvagrant ssh\nsudo su -\napt-get update && apt-get -y install python python-pip\npip2 install pyOpenSSL\n```\n\nThe error occurs at the last step. What is the correct way to install pyOpenSSL on Ubuntu 18.04 currently? Is there a workaround for this problem? Or, is there a Python distribution for Ansible that includes all dependencies so I don't have to compile build my own Ansible client?\n\nThe error message I receive is as follows:\n\n```shell\nroot@ubuntu1804:~# pip2 install pyOpenSSL\n...\nc/_cffi_backend.c:15:10: fatal error: ffi.h: No such file or directory\n #include &lt;ffi.h&gt;\n          ^~~~~~~\ncompilation terminated.\nerror: command 'x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc' failed with exit status 1\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the missing `libffi` development package, which is required to compile the `cffi` module, a dependency of `pyOpenSSL`. Here's how you can resolve this issue on Ubuntu 18.04:\n\n1. **Install the missing dependencies:**\n   You need to install the `libffi-dev` package, along with some other necessary build tools and libraries.\n\n   ```shell\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install -y libffi-dev libssl-dev python-dev build-essential\n   ```\n\n2. **Install pyOpenSSL:**\n   After installing the required packages, you can proceed to install `pyOpenSSL` using pip.\n\n   ```shell\n   pip2 install pyOpenSSL\n   ```\n\n3. **Alternative: Use a Python Virtual Environment**\n   It's a good practice to use a virtual environment for Python projects, as it helps isolate the package dependencies.\n\n   ```shell\n   # Install virtualenv if not already installed\n   pip2 install virtualenv\n\n   # Create a new virtual environment\n   virtualenv ansible-env\n\n   # Activate the virtual environment\n   source ansible-env/bin/activate\n\n   # Now install pyOpenSSL inside the virtual environment\n   pip install pyOpenSSL\n   ```\n\n4. **Consider Python 3:**\n   Since Python 2 has reached its end-of-life, it's recommended to transition to Python 3, if possible. Ansible supports Python 3, and many modern libraries have better support for it.\n\n   ```shell\n   sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip\n   pip3 install pyOpenSSL\n   ```\n\n5. **Pre-packaged Ansible:**\n   If you want to avoid handling dependencies manually, you can use Ansible through a container or a pre-packaged distribution. Ansible offers an official Docker image which includes all dependencies.\n\n   ```shell\n   # Pull the official Ansible Docker image\n   docker pull ansible/ansible\n\n   # Use the image to run Ansible commands\n   docker run --rm -it ansible/ansible ansible --version\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `ffi.h` error and successfully install `pyOpenSSL` on Ubuntu 18.04."
