The program should output the letter and its frequency in the format \"Letter: frequency\". The puzzle involves sorting the letters in the string based on their frequency, and then using that order to determine the highest frequency letter. Good luck!"

        "content": "Sure! Here's a C# program that solves the logic puzzle by finding the letter with the highest frequency in the given string \"abbcddddeef\":\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        string input = \"abbcddddeef\";\n        FindHighestFrequencyLetter(input);\n    }\n\n    static void FindHighestFrequencyLetter(string input)\n    {\n        // Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each letter\n        Dictionary<char, int> frequencyDict = new Dictionary<char, int>();\n\n        // Count the frequency of each letter in the string\n        foreach (char letter in input)\n        {\n            if (frequencyDict.ContainsKey(letter))\n            {\n                frequencyDict[letter]++;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                frequencyDict[letter] = 1;\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Sort the dictionary by frequency in descending order\n        var sortedByFrequency = frequencyDict.OrderByDescending(x => x.Value);\n\n        // Get the letter with the highest frequency\n        var highestFrequencyLetter = sortedByFrequency.First();\n\n        // Output the result\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Letter: {highestFrequencyLetter.Key}, Frequency: {highestFrequencyLetter.Value}\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### How It Works:\n1. **Dictionary for Counting**: The program uses a dictionary to store the frequency of each letter in the input string.\n2. **Counting Frequencies**: It iterates through each character in the string, updating the dictionary with the count of each letter.\n3. **Sorting**: The dictionary is then sorted by frequency in descending order.\n4. **Output**: The program identifies the letter with the highest frequency and prints it in the format \"Letter: frequency\".\n\nWhen you run this program, it outputs:\n```\nLetter: d, Frequency: 4\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the letter with the highest frequency using sorting and dictionary operations."
