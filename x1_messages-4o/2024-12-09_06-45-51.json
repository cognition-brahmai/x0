I have a dataframe with columns 'L1', 'L2', 'L3' and I want to group by 'L1' and perform calculations on 'L3'. After performing the calculations, I want to append the results under a new label \"new\". However, when I am trying to do that, I get a 'TypeError: incompatible index of inserted column with frame index'. Below is the code I am using to perform these operations:\n\n```python\nfrom pandas import *\nimport pandas as pd\n\nd = {'L1' : Series(['X','X','Z','X','Z','Y','Z','Y','Y',]),\n     'L2' : Series([1,2,1,3,2,1,3,2,3]),\n     'L3' : Series([50,100,15,200,10,1,20,10,100])}\ndf = DataFrame(d)  \ndf.groupby('L1', as_index=False).apply(lambda x : pd.expanding_sum(x.sort('L3', ascending=False)['L3'])/x['L3'].sum())\ndf[\"new\"] = df.groupby(\"L1\", as_index=False).apply(lambda x : pd.expanding_sum(x.sort(\"L3\", ascending=False)[\"L3\"])/x[\"L3\"].sum())\n```\n\nThe error I'm getting is:\n\n```python\n2196                         value = value.reindex(self.index).values\n2197                     except:\n-> 2198                         raise TypeError('incompatible index of inserted column with frame index')\n2199                                         'with frame index'\n2200 \nTypeError: incompatible index of inserted column with frame index\n```\n\nCan someone help me understand what the problem is and how I can reinsert the calculated value into the dataframe so it shows the values in order (descending by \"new\" for each label X, Y, Z.)?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the result of the `apply` operation returns a DataFrame with a different index than your original DataFrame. This happens because the `apply` function with `groupby` returns a new DataFrame with a hierarchical index, which doesn't match the original DataFrame's index. To solve this, you need to ensure that the result of the computation aligns with the original DataFrame's index.\n\nAlso, note that `pd.expanding_sum` is not the correct function here since it has been removed in recent versions of pandas. Instead, you can use the `expanding` method followed by `sum`.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired result:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Creating the DataFrame\nd = {'L1': pd.Series(['X', 'X', 'Z', 'X', 'Z', 'Y', 'Z', 'Y', 'Y']),\n     'L2': pd.Series([1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3]),\n     'L3': pd.Series([50, 100, 15, 200, 10, 1, 20, 10, 100])}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(d)\n\n# Define a function to calculate the expanding sum and normalize it\ndef calculate_expanding_sum(group):\n    sorted_group = group.sort_values('L3', ascending=False)\n    expanding_sum = sorted_group['L3'].expanding().sum()\n    return expanding_sum / sorted_group['L3'].sum()\n\n# Apply the calculation and ensure the index aligns with the original DataFrame\ndf['new'] = df.groupby('L1', group_keys=False).apply(calculate_expanding_sum)\n\n# Sort the DataFrame by 'L1' and then by 'new' within each group\ndf = df.sort_values(by=['L1', 'new'], ascending=[True, False])\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Sorting and Calculating Expanding Sum**: The `calculate_expanding_sum` function sorts each group by 'L3' in descending order and calculates the expanding sum, normalizing it by dividing by the total sum of 'L3' in the group.\n\n2. **Apply with `group_keys=False`**: This ensures that the result of the `apply` function has the same index as the original DataFrame, thus avoiding the index mismatch error.\n\n3. **Sorting the DataFrame**: Finally, the DataFrame is sorted by 'L1' and then by 'new' in descending order within each group to match your requirement.\n\nThis should solve the problem and give you the DataFrame with the desired calculated column."
