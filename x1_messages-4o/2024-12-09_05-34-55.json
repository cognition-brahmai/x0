My list is generated using the following code: `map( lambda f,p: f.match(p), list(patterns.itervalues()), vatids )`. This outputs a list as such: `[None, <_sre.SRE_Match object at 0xb73bfdb0>, None]`. I am looking for a one-liner check that can inform me if all elements in the returned list are `None`. How can I achieve this?"

Here's how you can do it in a one-liner:\n\n```python\nall_none = all(item is None for item in your_list)\n```\n\nIn this expression, `your_list` is the list you generated. The `all()` function will return `True` if all elements in the generator expression are `None`, and `False` otherwise."
