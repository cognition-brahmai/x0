Additionally, could you give me an analysis of the data by comparing the temperatures of the planets and determining which planet has the highest estimated temperature? It would be great if you could also provide an explanation of how the distance from the sun affects the planet's temperature and how the luminosity of a planet relates to its temperature. Here's the formula:\nT = ((L/16\u03c0\u03c3D^2))^1/4\nwhere T is the temperature in Kelvin, L is the planet's luminosity, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the planet's distance from the Sun.\nMoreover, it would be helpful if you could create a graph that illustrates the relationship between the distance from the sun and the temperature of each planet. Lastly, could you also provide me with the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit for each planet to make it easier for me to understand? Here's the data from NASA:\nPlanet    Luminosity (W)    Distance from Sun (m)\nMercury   6.34e23           5.79e10\nVenus     1.93e24           1.08e11\nEarth     1.74e17           1.50e11\nMars      2.07e16           2.28e11\nJupiter   9.94e25           7.78e11\nSaturn    2.48e24           1.43e12\nUranus    7.82e22           2.87e12\nNeptune   1.03e23           4.50e12\nThank you for your detailed assistance."

        "content": "Certainly! Below is a Ruby script that calculates the estimated temperature of each planet using the Stefan-Boltzmann law formula.

This means that as the distance from the Sun increases, the temperature decreases.\n\n2. **Luminosity and Temperature**:\n   - Luminosity directly affects the temperature in the formula. A higher luminosity results in a higher temperature because the planet emits more energy.\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - The script calculates the temperature in Kelvin and converts it to Celsius and Fahrenheit for easier understanding.\n   - From the data given and calculations performed, you can observe that the planet with the highest estimated temperature will be identified and printed.\n\n4. **Graph**:\n   - The graph illustrates how temperature decreases as the distance from the Sun increases.\n\nThis code snippet uses the `gnuplot` gem for plotting, so ensure you have it installed by running `gem install gnuplot` before executing the script."
