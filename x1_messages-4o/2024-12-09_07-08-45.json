However, when I try to use this variable inside a regular expression in the re.search() function, I'm not getting the expected results. Here's the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nTEXTO = sys.argv[1]\n\nif re.search(r\"\\b(?=\\w)TEXTO\\b(?!\\w)\", subject, re.IGNORECASE):\n    # Successful match\nelse:\n    # Match attempt failed\n```\nHow can I correctly use the TEXTO variable inside the regular expression?"

        "content": "To use a variable inside a regular expression in Python, you need to construct the regular expression string dynamically, incorporating the variable. In your code, the `TEXTO` variable is treated as a literal string within the regular expression due to the way it is written. To fix this, you can use an f-string or the `format()` method to embed the variable within the regular expression pattern.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use the `TEXTO` variable correctly:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport re\n\nTEXTO = sys.argv[1]\nsubject = \"Your subject string here\"  # Replace this with the actual subject string\n\n# Use an f-string to embed the variable inside the regular expression pattern\npattern = rf\"\\b(?=\\w){re.escape(TEXTO)}\\b(?!\\w)\"\n\nif re.search(pattern, subject, re.IGNORECASE):\n    print(\"Successful match\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Match attempt failed\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **String Interpolation**: The `rf\"\"` syntax is used to create a raw f-string, allowing you to interpolate the `TEXTO` variable into the regular expression pattern directly.\n   \n2. **Escaping Special Characters**: Using `re.escape(TEXTO)` ensures that any special characters in the `TEXTO` variable are correctly escaped, preventing unintended behavior in the regular expression.\n\n3. **Pattern Construction**: This constructs the pattern dynamically with the value of `TEXTO` included, allowing `re.search()` to correctly interpret and use the variable's value in the search. \n\nBy making these changes, your variable will be correctly used inside the regular expression, and the search will yield expected results based on the actual value of `TEXTO`."
