I have strings such as '_1991_\u0627\u0641_\u062c\u064a2' and I want to identify these types of strings using Regex or any other fast method. I would like this operation to be efficient, thus I prefer not to compare the letters of the string one by one with a list of letters."

        "content": "To efficiently detect strings that contain a mix of English and non-English characters in Python, you can use regular expressions (regex). Specifically, you can create a regex pattern that looks for the presence of both English letters and non-English characters within the same string.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef contains_mixed_characters(s):\n    # Pattern to check for both English and non-English characters\n    english_pattern = r'[a-zA-Z]'\n    non_english_pattern = r'[^\\x00-\\x7F]'  # Matches any non-ASCII character\n\n    # Check if the string contains at least one English and one non-English character\n    return bool(re.search(english_pattern, s) and re.search(non_english_pattern, s))\n\n# Test strings\nstrings = [\n    '_1991_\u0627\u0641_\u062c\u064a2',\n    'HelloWorld',\n    '\u0645\u0631\u062d\u0628\u0627',\n    'Hello\u0645\u0631\u062d\u0628\u0627'\n]\n\n# Check each string for mixed characters\nmixed_strings = [s for s in strings if contains_mixed_characters(s)]\n\nprint(mixed_strings)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **English Pattern (`[a-zA-Z]`)**: This regex pattern matches any English alphabet character (both uppercase and lowercase).\n\n- **Non-English Pattern (`[^\\x00-\\x7F]`)**: This regex pattern matches any character that is not an ASCII character (i.e., non-English or special characters).\n\n- **Function `contains_mixed_characters(s)`**: This function uses the `re.search()` method to check if both patterns are found in the string. If both are present, it returns `True`, indicating that the string contains a mix of English and non-English characters.\n\nThis approach is efficient because it leverages regex to handle the pattern matching, rather than manually iterating through each character in the string."
