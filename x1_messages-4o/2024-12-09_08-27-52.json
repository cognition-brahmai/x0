I have set up the app.yaml file to serve static files that exist, but if a file doesn't exist, it returns a null length file instead of a 404 error. The app.yaml file is set up as follows:\n\n```\n- url: (.*)/\n  static_files: static\\1/index.html\n  uplaod: static/index.html\n\n- url: /\n  static_dir: static\n```\n\nAll the static html/jpg files are stored under the static directory. When trying to fetch a non-existent file (nosuch.html), I receive the following log:\n\n```\nERROR    2008-11-25 20:08:34,084 dev_appserver.py] Error encountered reading file \"/usr/home/ctuffli/www/tufflinet/static/nosuch.html\":\n[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/usr/home/ctuffli/www/tufflinet/static/nosuch.html'\nINFO     2008-11-25 20:08:34,088 dev_appserver.py] \"GET /nosuch.html HTTP/1.1\" 404 -\n```\n\nHow do I modify my setup to serve the static files that exist but run a python script to return a 404 error for files that don't exist?"

        "content": "To handle 404 errors properly in your Google App Engine setup, you can modify your `app.yaml` to include a handler for non-existent files. This will allow you to serve static files that exist and execute a script when a file doesn't exist, returning a 404 error. Below is a revised configuration:\n\n1. **Modify `app.yaml`:**\n\n```yaml\nhandlers:\n- url: (.*)/\n  static_files: static\\1/index.html\n  upload: static/index.html\n\n- url: /\n  static_dir: static\n\n# Add a catch-all handler at the end\n- url: /.*\n  script: auto\n```\n\n2. **Create a Python script to handle 404 errors:**\n\nYou'll need to create a simple Python script that will be triggered by the catch-all handler to return a 404 error when a file is not found.\n\nCreate a file named `main.py` (or any name you prefer):\n\n```python\nimport webapp2\n\nclass NotFoundHandler(webapp2.RequestHandler):\n    def get(self):\n        self.response.set_status(404)\n        self.response.write('404 Not Found')\n\napp = webapp2.WSGIApplication([\n    ('/.*', NotFoundHandler),\n], debug=True)\n```\n\n3. **Deploy your app:**\n\nMake sure your `app.yaml` and `main.py` (or whatever you named your Python script) are in the root directory of your app. Deploy your updated application using the following command:\n\n```bash\ngcloud app deploy\n```\n\nThis configuration should serve existing static files as intended, and when a file is not found, it will trigger the `NotFoundHandler` in your Python script, returning a 404 error to the client."
