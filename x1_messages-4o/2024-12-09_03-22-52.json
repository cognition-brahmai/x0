Specifically, I want the code to stop immediately when it finds an element that is not the same as the first element. For example, [[0,0],[0,0]] should return true but [[0,1],[0,0]] would return false. Here is the code I have so far, but I'm unsure about how to implement the requirement to stop the loop if L[i][j] is not equal to n, and return false. Otherwise, the function should return true.\n\n```python\nn=L[0][0]\nm=len(A)\nfor i in range(m):\n for j in range(m):\n   if L[i][j]==n: \n    continue \n   else: \n    stop the loop\n```"

        "content": "To implement the requirement where the loop stops immediately when it finds an element that is not the same as the first element, you can use a `return` statement to exit the function when the condition is met. Here's how you can structure your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef all_elements_same(L):\n    n = L[0][0]  # Take the first element as the reference\n    m = len(L)  # Get the size of the matrix (assuming it's nxn)\n    \n    for i in range(m):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if L[i][j] != n:\n                return False  # Return false if any element is not equal to the first element\n    return True  # Return true if all elements are the same\n\n# Example usage:\nmatrix1 = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]\nmatrix2 = [[0, 1], [0, 0]]\n\nprint(all_elements_same(matrix1))  # Output: True\nprint(all_elements_same(matrix2))  # Output: False\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `all_elements_same` takes a matrix `L` as input.\n- It initializes `n` as the first element of the matrix `L[0][0]`.\n- It iterates over each element of the matrix using nested loops.\n- If it finds any element that is not equal to `n`, it immediately returns `False`.\n- If it completes the loop without finding any differing elements, it returns `True`. \n\nThis approach ensures that the function stops checking as soon as a differing element is found, thus improving efficiency."
