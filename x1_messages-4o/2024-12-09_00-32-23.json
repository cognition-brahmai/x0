I would like to understand what is being returned when `inplace=True` is passed versus when `inplace=False` is used. Are all operations modifying `self` when `inplace=True`? Moreover, when `inplace=False` is used, is a new object created immediately such as `new_df = self` and then `new_df` is returned?"

        "content": "In the pandas library, the `inplace` parameter controls whether the operation modifies the original DataFrame (or Series) object directly or returns a new object with the changes.\n\n1. **When `inplace=True`:**\n   - The operation modifies the original DataFrame or Series directly. This means that the changes are applied to the same object in memory, and no new object is created or returned.\n   - The method returns `None`. This is because the focus is on modifying the object in place, so there's nothing to return since the changes are already reflected in `self`.\n\n2. **When `inplace=False`:**\n   - The operation does not modify the original DataFrame or Series. Instead, it creates a new object with the applied changes.\n   - This new object is returned by the method. The original object remains unchanged.\n   - Internally, the operation would involve creating a copy of the original data, applying the changes to this copy, and then returning it.\n\nSo, when `inplace=False`, a new object is created and returned with the changes, ensuring that the original object remains unaffected. This is useful when you want to keep the original data intact for further use or comparisons. On the other hand, using `inplace=True` is beneficial for memory efficiency, especially with large datasets, as it avoids creating additional copies of the data."
