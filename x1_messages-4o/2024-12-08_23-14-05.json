This script assumes that the JSON data is structured as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a book with keys for \"title\", \"author\", \"year\", and \"genre\".\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef extract_21st_century_novels(json_data):\n    # Filter for novels published in the 21st century\n    novels_21st_century = [\n        book for book in json_data\n        if book.get('year') and isinstance(book['year'], int) and book['year'] >= 2000\n    ]\n\n    # Select the first 6 novels\n    return novels_21st_century[:6]\n\n# Sample JSON data\njson_data = [\n    {\"title\": \"Novel 1\", \"author\": \"Author A\", \"year\": 1999, \"genre\": \"Fiction\"},\n    {\"title\": \"Novel 2\", \"author\": \"Author B\", \"year\": 2001, \"genre\": \"Fiction\"},\n    {\"title\": \"Novel 3\", \"author\": \"Author C\", \"year\": 2005, \"genre\": \"Fiction\"},\n    {\"title\": \"Novel 4\", \"author\": \"Author D\", \"year\": 2010, \"genre\": \"Fiction\"},\n    {\"title\": \"Novel 5\", \"author\": \"Author E\", \"year\": 2015, \"genre\": \"Fiction\"},\n    {\"title\": \"Novel 6\", \"author\": \"Author F\", \"year\": 2020, \"genre\": \"Fiction\"},\n    {\"title\": \"Novel 7\", \"author\": \"Author G\", \"year\": 2021, \"genre\": \"Fiction\"},\n    {\"title\": \"Novel 8\", \"author\": \"Author H\", \"year\": 2022, \"genre\": \"Fiction\"},\n]\n\n# Assuming the JSON data is loaded into the variable json_data\nnovels_21st_century = extract_21st_century_novels(json_data)\n\n# Output the result\nfor novel in novels_21st_century:\n    print(f\"Title: {novel['title']}, Author: {novel['author']}, Year: {novel['year']}\")\n\n```\n\nThis code will filter all the novels published from the year 2000 onwards and select the first six of them. You can replace the `json_data` with actual data from your JSON file. Make sure to load the JSON content using `json.load()` if you are reading from a file."
