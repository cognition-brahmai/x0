However, I often encounter a \"_mysql_exceptions.OperationalError: (2006, 'MySQL server has gone away')\" error. If I retry the query immediately, it tends to succeed. Is there a Pythonic way to automatically retry the query up to a fixed number of times, say 5, before giving up? Here's my current code:\n\n```python\nconn = MySQLdb.connect(host, user, password, database)\ncursor = conn.cursor()\n\ntry:\n    cursor.execute(query)\n    rows = cursor.fetchall()\n    for row in rows:\n        # do something with the data\nexcept MySQLdb.Error, e:\n    print \"MySQL Error %d: %s\" % (e.args[0], e.args[1])\n```\nI understand that I could include another attempt in the except clause, but I believe there must be a cleaner way to achieve this."

        "content": "To handle the \"MySQL server has gone away\" error and automatically retry the query, you can implement a retry mechanism using a loop or a decorator. Here's a clean and Pythonic way to do it using a loop within a function:\n\n```python\nimport MySQLdb\nimport time\n\ndef execute_query_with_retries(query, retries=5, delay=2):\n    attempt = 0\n    while attempt < retries:\n        try:\n            conn = MySQLdb.connect(host, user, password, database)\n            cursor = conn.cursor()\n            cursor.execute(query)\n            rows = cursor.fetchall()\n            for row in rows:\n                # do something with the data\n            return rows  # Return the results if successful\n        except MySQLdb.OperationalError as e:\n            if e.args[0] == 2006:  # Error code for \"MySQL server has gone away\"\n                attempt += 1\n                print(f\"Attempt {attempt} failed: {e}. Retrying after {delay} seconds...\")\n                time.sleep(delay)  # Wait before retrying\n            else:\n                # If it's a different error, re-raise it\n                raise\n        finally:\n            if conn:\n                conn.close()  # Ensure the connection is closed in any case\n    raise Exception(\"Max retries exceeded\")\n\n# Usage\nquery = \"SELECT * FROM your_table\"\ntry:\n    results = execute_query_with_retries(query)\n    for result in results:\n        # Process your results here\n        print(result)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Query failed after retries: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Loop with Retries**: The code uses a loop to attempt the query up to the specified number of retries (`retries=5`).\n\n2. **Delay Between Retries**: A delay (`delay=2` seconds) is added between retries to give the server some time before the next attempt.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: The code specifically checks for the `OperationalError` with error code `2006`, which indicates \"MySQL server has gone away\". If a different error occurs, it is re-raised.\n\n4. **Connection Management**: The connection is closed in the `finally` block to ensure resources are properly released regardless of success or failure.\n\n5. **Return the Results**: The function returns the result set if the query succeeds within the retry limit.\n\nThis approach provides a clean and manageable way to handle transient MySQL connection issues in your script."
