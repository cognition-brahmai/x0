The equation of a vertical line is of the form \\( x = k \\), where \\( k \\) is the x-coordinate of the points on the line.\n\nIn this case, since both points have an x-coordinate of 6, the equation of the line is:\n\n\\[\nx = 6\n\\]\n\nThis equation is already in a form with integer coefficients. Therefore, the equation of the line passing through the midpoint of AB and the point (6,1) is \\( x = 6 \\)."
