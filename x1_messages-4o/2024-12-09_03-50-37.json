My current code looks like this:\n\n```\nmy_csv = '{first},{middle},{last}'\nprint( my_csv.format( first='John', last='Doe' ) )\n```\n\nHowever, if I leave out one of the named parameters, such as 'middle', I get a KeyError exception. What I want is for those placeholders to be optional, so if a parameter isn't specified, its placeholder is simply removed. In the example above, I would want the output to be 'John,,Doe'. Is there a built-in way to make these placeholders optional, or will I have to implement a more in-depth solution?"

        "content": "In Python 2.7, the `str.format()` method doesn't support optional placeholders directly. However, you can achieve the desired behavior by using a custom approach. One way to handle this is by creating a helper function to replace missing placeholders with an empty string.\n\nHere's a method to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef safe_format(s, **kwargs):\n    class SafeDict(dict):\n        def __missing__(self, key):\n            return ''\n\n    return s.format_map(SafeDict(**kwargs))\n\nmy_csv = '{first},{middle},{last}'\noutput = safe_format(my_csv, first='John', last='Doe')\nprint(output)\n```\n\nIn this code, `SafeDict` is a subclass of `dict` that overrides the `__missing__` method to return an empty string if a key is not found. The `safe_format` function uses this `SafeDict` to ensure that any missing placeholders are replaced by an empty string, thus preventing a `KeyError`.\n\nThis will output:\n```\nJohn,,Doe\n```\n\nThis approach lets you use the `str.format()` method while safely handling missing placeholders."
