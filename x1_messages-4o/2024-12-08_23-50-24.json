        "content": "To solve the problem of adding two fractions and returning their sum as a simplified fraction, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find a Common Denominator**: The common denominator is the least common multiple (LCM) of the two denominators. This allows us to represent both fractions with the same denominator, facilitating their addition.\n\n2. **Convert to Equivalent Fractions**: Adjust the numerators of the fractions based on the common denominator.\n\n3. **Add the Fractions**: Add the numerators while keeping the common denominator.\n\n4. **Simplify the Resulting Fraction**: Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).\n\n5. **Handle Improper Fractions and Mixed Numbers**: If the resulting fraction is improper (numerator greater than denominator), convert it to a mixed number.\n\nLet\u2019s implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom math import gcd\nfrom functools import reduce\nfrom sympy import primefactors\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the least common multiple of a and b.\"\"\"\n    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)\n\ndef simplify_fraction(numerator, denominator):\n    \"\"\"Simplify the fraction to its lowest terms.\"\"\"\n    common_divisor = gcd(numerator, denominator)\n    return (numerator // common_divisor, denominator // common_divisor)\n\ndef add_fractions(frac1, frac2):\n    \"\"\"Add two fractions and return the result in simplified form.\"\"\"\n    num1, den1 = frac1\n    num2, den2 = frac2\n\n    # Find the least common denominator\n    common_denominator = lcm(den1, den2)\n\n    # Convert to equivalent fractions with the common denominator\n    num1_adjusted = num1 * (common_denominator // den1)\n    num2_adjusted = num2 * (common_denominator // den2)\n\n    # Add numerators\n    result_numerator = num1_adjusted + num2_adjusted\n\n    # Simplify the result\n    simplified_numerator, simplified_denominator = simplify_fraction(result_numerator, common_denominator)\n\n    # Convert to mixed number if necessary\n    whole_number = simplified_numerator // simplified_denominator\n    remainder = simplified_numerator % simplified_denominator\n\n    if whole_number != 0:\n        return (whole_number, (remainder, simplified_denominator))\n    else:\n        return (simplified_numerator, simplified_denominator)\n\ndef prime_factorization_table(den1, den2):\n    \"\"\"Create a table of prime factorization for each denominator.\"\"\"\n    factors1 = primefactors(den1)\n    factors2 = primefactors(den2)\n\n    common_factors = set(factors1) & set(factors2)\n\n    print(\"Denominator Prime Factorization Table:\")\n    print(f\"{'Denominator':<15}{'Prime Factors':<20}{'Common Factors'}\")\n    print(f\"{den1:<15}{factors1:<20}{[factor for factor in factors1 if factor in common_factors]}\")\n    print(f\"{den2:<15}{factors2:<20}{[factor for factor in factors2 if factor in common_factors]}\")\n\n# Example usage:\nfrac1 = (3, 4)\nfrac2 = (5, 6)\n\nresult = add_fractions(frac1, frac2)\nprint(f\"Sum of fractions: {result}\")\n\nprime_factorization_table(frac1[1], frac2[1])\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Common Denominator**: To add fractions, they must have the same denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of the two denominators is used as the common denominator because it is the smallest number that both denominators can divide into without a remainder.\n\n- **Prime Factorization**: By breaking each denominator into prime factors, we can easily find the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime number present in any of the denominators.\n\n- **Simplification**: The greatest common divisor (GCD) is used to simplify the resulting fraction, ensuring it's in its simplest form.\n\n- **Improper Fractions and Mixed Numbers**: If the numerator of the resulting fraction is greater than its denominator, it can be expressed as a mixed number, where the whole number part is obtained by integer division of the numerator by the denominator, and the fractional part is the remainder over the denominator.\n\nThis approach provides a complete solution for adding and simplifying fractions, handling improper fractions, and presenting prime factorization for clarity."
