        "content": "Let's break down the problem step-by-step and solve it.\n\n### Step 1: Sum of All Prime Numbers from 1 to 100\n\nFirst, we need to list all the prime numbers between 1 and 100. The prime numbers are:\n\n\\[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97\\]\n\nThe sum of these prime numbers is:\n\n\\[2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 29 + 31 + 37 + 41 + 43 + 47 + 53 + 59 + 61 + 67 + 71 + 73 + 79 + 83 + 89 + 97 = 1060\\]\n\n### Step 2: Product of the Three Smallest Prime Numbers\n\nThe three smallest prime numbers are 2, 3, and 5. Their product is:\n\n\\[2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 30\\]\n\n### Step 3: Divide the Sum by the Product and Add 4\n\nNow, divide the sum of prime numbers by the product of the three smallest prime numbers:\n\n\\[\\frac{1060}{30} \\approx 35.3333\\]\n\nAdd 4 to this quotient:\n\n\\[35.3333 + 4 = 39.3333\\]\n\n### Step 4: Multiply the Result by 7\n\nMultiply the result by 7:\n\n\\[39.3333 \\times 7 = 275.3331\\]\n\n### Step 5: Subtract 13 from the Product\n\nSubtract 13 from this result:\n\n\\[275.3331 - 13 = 262.3331\\]\n\nSo, the final value is approximately **262.3331**.\n\n### Code to Generate a Table of Prime Numbers and Their Squares\n\nHere is the Python code to generate a table showing the prime numbers from 1 to 100 and their corresponding squares:\n\n```python\n# List of prime numbers from 1 to 100\nprime_numbers = [\n    2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53,\n    59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97\n]\n\n# Create a table of prime numbers and their squares\nprint(f\"{'Prime Number':<15} {'Square':<10}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 25)\nfor prime in prime_numbers:\n    square = prime ** 2\n    print(f\"{prime:<15} {square:<10}\")\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it outputs a table of prime numbers and their squares:\n\n```\nPrime Number   Square    \n-------------------------\n2              4         \n3              9         \n5              25        \n7              49        \n11             121       \n13             169       \n17             289       \n19             361       \n23             529       \n29             841       \n31             961       \n37             1369      \n41             1681      \n43             1849      \n47             2209      \n53             2809      \n59             3481      \n61             3721      \n67             4489      \n71             5041      \n73             5329      \n79             6241      \n83             6889      \n89             7921      \n97             9409      \n```\n\nFeel free to run the code to see the table yourself!"
