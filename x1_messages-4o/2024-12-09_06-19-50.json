The script runs perfectly on Ubuntu 13.10 and displays the scissor character with no issues when run from IDLE (Python 3.2.5 - OS X 10.4.11 iBook G4 PPC). However, when I attempt to run this in the terminal, I get the following error and traceback:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"snippets-convert.py\", line 352, in <module>\n    main()\n  File \"snippets-convert.py\", line 41, in main\n    menu()\n  File \"snippets-convert.py\", line 47, in menu\n    print (\"|\\t \",snipper.decode(),\"PySnipt'd\",snipper.decode(),\"\\t|\")\nUnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character '\\u2702' in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)\n```\nThe code that seems to be causing the problem is: `print (\"|\\t \",chr(9986),\"PySnipt'd\",chr(9986),\"\\t|\")`.\n\nDoes this error indicate that the terminal does not have the capability to display that character? Could the age of the OS be interfering with the program? What could be causing this error? Is it the age of the system/OS, the version of Python, or could it be a programming error?"

        "content": "The `UnicodeEncodeError` you're encountering is likely due to the terminal's inability to handle Unicode characters properly. This is a common issue, especially on older systems or when the terminal's environment is not configured to use a UTF-8 locale. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Terminal Encoding:**\n   Ensure your terminal is set to use UTF-8 encoding. You can usually set this in the terminal preferences or by configuring your shell.\n\n2. **Set Locale:**\n   Check your current locale settings by running `locale` in the terminal. You should see something like `en_US.UTF-8`. If it is set to something like `C` or `POSIX`, you might need to change it to a UTF-8 locale. You can set this temporarily in your session with:\n   ```bash\n   export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8\n   export LANG=en_US.UTF-8\n   ```\n   You might need to add these lines to your shell's configuration file (like `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`) to make the change permanent.\n\n3. **Update Python Code:**\n   If your locale and terminal settings are configured correctly but the issue persists, you can modify your Python code to ensure it handles Unicode properly.\n   \n   Instead of using `chr(9986)` directly in the `print` statement, you can encode it as UTF-8. Here's an example:\n   ```python\n   print(\"|\", \"\\t\", chr(9986).encode('utf-8').decode('utf-8'), \"PySnipt'd\", chr(9986).encode('utf-8').decode('utf-8'), \"\\t|\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Upgrade Python:**\n   If you're using an older version of Python, upgrading to a more recent version might help, as newer versions have better Unicode support.\n\n5. **Check Python Environment:**\n   Make sure your Python environment is correctly set up to handle Unicode. If necessary, you can set the default encoding in your script by adding these lines at the top:\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   sys.setdefaultencoding('utf-8')\n   ```\n\nRemember that modifying the `sys.setdefaultencoding` function is generally not recommended in production code, but it can be useful for debugging purposes.\n\nBy ensuring your environment is set up to handle UTF-8 and making sure your Python code manages Unicode correctly, you should be able to resolve the `UnicodeEncodeError`."
