However, I'm having difficulty creating the DataFrame using numpy arrays. When I create a DataFrame, the shape is (1,2), but I want it to be (5,2). How can I accomplish this? Here is my current code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nx = np.random.randn(1,5)\ny = np.sin(x)\ndf = pd.DataFrame(d)\n```"

        "content": "It looks like there might have been a small mistake in your code. You are generating `x` as a 2D numpy array with shape (1,5), but you want a DataFrame with shape (5,2). To achieve this, you should generate `x` and `y` as 1D arrays with 5 elements each and then create a DataFrame with columns for `x` and `y`. Here's how you can do that:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Generate 1D arrays with 5 elements\nx = np.random.randn(5)\ny = np.sin(x)\n\n# Create a DataFrame with columns 'x' and 'y'\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'x': x, 'y': y})\n\n# Display the DataFrame\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThis code will create a DataFrame `df` with 5 rows and 2 columns, where one column corresponds to the `x` values and the other to the `y` values. Each row represents a point in your 2D scatter plot."
