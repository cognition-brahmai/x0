        "content": "The error you're encountering, `ImportError: cannot import name RE_TYPE`, suggests that there might be an issue with the package versions or with how the modules are being imported. Here are steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Versions**: Ensure you have the latest version of `pymongo` and `bson`. You can update them using `pip`:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install --upgrade pymongo\n    ```\n\n2. **Import Correctly**: The error might also be due to how `ObjectId` is being imported. Make sure it's being imported from `bson`, not `pymongo`:\n\n    ```python\n    from pymongo import MongoClient\n    from bson.objectid import ObjectId\n\n    client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\n    db = client['your_database']\n    collection = db['your_collection']\n\n    # Assuming 'modem' is a dictionary with a valid ObjectId string\n    gate = collection.find({'_id': ObjectId(modem[\"dis_imei\"])})\n    for doc in gate:\n        print(doc)\n    ```\n\n3. **Python Compatibility**: Ensure that you are using a compatible version of Python for the version of PyMongo you have installed. Python 2.7 is quite old, and it might be causing compatibility issues. Consider upgrading to Python 3 if possible.\n\n4. **Virtual Environment**: If possible, create a new virtual environment and install only the necessary packages to avoid conflicts with other packages:\n\n    ```bash\n    python -m venv myenv\n    source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\\Scripts\\activate`\n    pip install pymongo\n    ```\n\n5. **Check for Copy-Paste Issues**: Ensure that there are no typos or copy-paste errors in the code. Every character matters in Python imports.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the import error and successfully query MongoDB using `ObjectId`."
