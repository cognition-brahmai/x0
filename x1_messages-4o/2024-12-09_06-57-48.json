        "content": "In Django, the `request.POST` object is a `QueryDict`, which means you need to use the `.items()` method to properly iterate over the keys and values. Your current code is attempting to unpack the keys and values directly from the `QueryDict`, which doesn't work as intended. Here's how you can correctly loop through the `POST` variables:\n\n```python\nfor k, v in request.POST.items():\n    print(k, v)\n```\n\nHere's a brief explanation of each part:\n\n- `request.POST` is a dictionary-like object containing all the POST data from the request.\n- The `.items()` method returns a list of tuples, where each tuple is a key-value pair from the dictionary.\n- `k` and `v` are the key and value for each POST variable, respectively.\n\nThis should provide you with the expected results, where each line of output shows a key-value pair from the POST data."
