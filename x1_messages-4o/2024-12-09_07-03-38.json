The program's purpose is to display data from my MySQL database in a tkinter form. The error messages that I'm receiving are \"IndexError: tuple index out of range\" at the lines where I attempt to assign values from the database rows to the variables 'x' and 'y'. Can someone assist me in resolving these errors? Here's the code:\n\n```python\nfrom Tkinter import *\nimport MySQLdb\n\ndef button_click():\n    root.destroy()\n\nroot = Tk()\nroot.geometry(\"600x500+10+10\")\nroot.title(\"Ariba\")\n\nmyContainer = Frame(root)\nmyContainer.pack(side=TOP, expand=YES, fill=BOTH)\n\ndb = MySQLdb.connect (\"localhost\",\"root\",\"\",\"chocoholics\")\ns = \"Select * from member\"\ncursor = db.cursor()\ncursor.execute(s)\nrows = cursor.fetchall()\n\nx = rows[1][1] + \" \" + rows[1][2]\nmyLabel1 = Label(myContainer, text = x)\ny = rows[2][1] + \" \" + rows[2][2]\nmyLabel2 = Label(myContainer, text = y)\nbtn = Button(myContainer, text = \"Quit\", command=button_click, height=1, width=6)\n\nmyLabel1.pack(side=TOP, expand=NO, fill=BOTH)\nmyLabel2.pack(side=TOP, expand=NO, fill=BOTH)\nbtn.pack(side=TOP, expand=YES, fill=NONE)\n```"

        "content": "The error message \"IndexError: tuple index out of range\" indicates that you are trying to access an index in a tuple that does not exist. This usually happens when the data you are attempting to access does not have as many elements as you expect.\n\nIn your code, you are accessing `rows[1][1]`, `rows[1][2]`, `rows[2][1]`, and `rows[2][2]`. This suggests that you expect at least three rows in your query result and each row to have at least three columns. If the database table `member` does not contain enough rows or columns, you will encounter this error.\n\nHere are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Enough Rows and Columns:**\n   - Check your database table `member` to ensure it has at least three rows and enough columns for the indices you are trying to access.\n\n2. **Add Error Handling:**\n   - Before accessing the elements, check if the `rows` list has enough data:\n\n   ```python\n   if len(rows) > 2 and len(rows[1]) > 2 and len(rows[2]) > 2:\n       x = rows[1][1] + \" \" + rows[1][2]\n       y = rows[2][1] + \" \" + rows[2][2]\n   else:\n       x = \"Not enough data\"\n       y = \"Not enough data\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Check Your Query:**\n   - Ensure that your SQL query `Select * from member` is correct and that it returns the expected number of rows and columns.\n\n4. **Debugging:**\n   - You can print the `rows` variable to see what data is being fetched from the database:\n\n   ```python\n   print(rows)\n   ```\n\n   This will help you understand the structure and content of the fetched data.\n\n5. **Database Connection:**\n   - Ensure that your database connection is correct, and the database server is running.\n\nWith these checks and modifications, you should be able to resolve the `IndexError` and correctly display the data in your Tkinter form."
