I have a line of code, `X_new_counts = count_vect.transform(input.plot_movie)`, which is similar to `X_new_tfidf = tfidf_transformer.transform(X_new_counts)` from the tutorial. This function should take an iterable as its input, but when I use `input.plot_movie` of type `pd.Series` from a DataFrame as the input, I get an error stating \"Iterable over raw text documents expected, string object received\". Even when I convert `input.plot_movie` from unicode to string, I encounter the same error. How can I fix this?"

        "content": "The error message \"Iterable over raw text documents expected, string object received\" suggests that the function expects a list or another iterable of text documents rather than a single string or a pandas Series object. \n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Input is Iterable**: You need to ensure that you're passing an iterable of strings to the `transform` method. If `input.plot_movie` is a pandas Series, you might want to convert it into a list. You can do this by using the `.tolist()` method of a pandas Series.\n\n2. **Convert to List**: If you have a single document and want to transform it, you should pass it as a list with a single element.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\n# If input.plot_movie is a single string or Series with a single element\nif isinstance(input.plot_movie, pd.Series):\n    X_new_counts = count_vect.transform(input.plot_movie.tolist())\nelse:\n    X_new_counts = count_vect.transform([input.plot_movie])\n```\n\nIf `input.plot_movie` is a Series with multiple text entries, the first part of the code handles it by converting it to a list, which is an acceptable input format for `transform`. If it's a single string, wrapping it in a list as shown in the `else` block will work.\n\n3. **Check the Content**: Make sure the content in `input.plot_movie` is what you expect it to be. Any unexpected types or content might cause issues.\n\nBy making sure that the input to `transform` is a list or another iterable containing text documents, you should be able to avoid that error."
