Here's an example:\nmy_str = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\nold_word = \"fox\"\nnew_word = \"cat\"\nnew_str = my_str.replace(old_word, new_word)\nprint(new_str)\nThis will output:\n\"The quick brown cat jumps over the lazy dog\"\nNote that the replace() method is case-sensitive, so it will only replace exact matches of the old word. If you want to replace all occurrences regardless of case, you can convert the string to lowercase using the lower() method before calling replace(). For example:\nmy_str = \"The quick brown FOX jumps over the lazy dog\"\nold_word = \"fox\"\nnew_word = \"cat\"\nnew_str = my_str.lower().replace(old_word.lower(), new_word)\nprint(new_str)\nThis will output:\n\"The quick brown cat jumps over the lazy dog\""

        "content": "To replace all occurrences of a specific word in a string with another word in Python, you can indeed use the `replace()` method. Below is the complete solution in the format you've requested:\n\n```python\n# Initial string\nmy_str = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\n\n# Words to replace\nold_word = \"fox\"\nnew_word = \"cat\"\n\n# Replace occurrences of old_word with new_word\nnew_str = my_str.replace(old_word, new_word)\n\n# Print the modified string\nprint(new_str)\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n```\n\"The quick brown cat jumps over the lazy dog\"\n```\n\nIf you want to perform a case-insensitive replacement, convert both the string and the word to lowercase before using `replace()`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Initial string with mixed case\nmy_str = \"The quick brown FOX jumps over the lazy dog\"\n\n# Words to replace with case-insensitivity\nold_word = \"fox\"\nnew_word = \"cat\"\n\n# Convert the string to lowercase and replace occurrences\nnew_str = my_str.lower().replace(old_word.lower(), new_word)\n\n# Print the modified string\nprint(new_str)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n```\n\"the quick brown cat jumps over the lazy dog\"\n```\n\nPlease note that converting the entire string to lowercase will change the case of other words as well. If you want to preserve the original case of other words, you might need a more sophisticated approach, such as using regular expressions with the `re` module."
