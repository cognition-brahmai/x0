Additionally, can you explain the differences in temperature scales, such as their origins and common usage around the world? Finally, can you provide a sample code that includes proper error handling and can handle inputs outside of the range of possible temperature values? \nHere is the excel table that shows the conversion of temperature values from Celsius to Fahrenheit:\n| Celsius  | Fahrenheit |\n|----------|------------|\n| 0        | 32         |\n| 5        | 41         |\n| 10       | 50         |\n| 15       | 59         |\n| 20       | 68         |\n| 25       | 77         |\n| 30       | 86         |\n| 35       | 95         |\n| 40       | 104        |\n| 45       | 113        |\n| 50       | 122        |\n| 55       | 131        |\n| 60       | 140        |\n| 65       | 149        |\n| 70       | 158        |\n| 75       | 167        |\n| 80       | 176        |\n| 85       | 185        |\n| 90       | 194        |\n| 95       | 203        |\n| 100      | 212        |\nThe Celsius scale is based on the freezing and boiling points of water, with 0\u00b0C being the freezing point and 100\u00b0C being the boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure. The Fahrenheit scale, on the other hand, was originally based on the freezing point of a saltwater solution and the average human body temperature. The common usage of temperature scales varies by region, with Fahrenheit being more commonly used in the United States and Celsius being more commonly used in the rest of the world.\nHere is a sample code in excel VBA that includes proper error handling and can handle inputs outside of the range of possible temperature values:\nSub ConvertTemp()\n    Dim celsius As Double\n    Dim fahrenheit As Double\n    \n    On Error GoTo ErrorHandler\n    \n    For celsius = 0 To 100 Step 5\n        fahrenheit = (celsius * 1.8) + 32\n        Cells(celsius / 5 + 1, 3).Value = celsius\n        Cells(celsius / 5 + 1, 4).Value = fahrenheit\n    Next celsius\n    \n    Exit Sub\n    \nErrorHandler:\n    MsgBox \"Invalid input.

Let's break down the elements you've asked for and provide you with the relevant information, explanations, and code.\n\n### Temperature Scales Explained\n\n1. **Celsius (\u00b0C)**\n   - Origin: Developed by Anders Celsius in 1742. This scale is based on the freezing point (0\u00b0C) and boiling point (100\u00b0C) of water at standard atmospheric pressure.\n   - Common Usage: Predominantly used worldwide, especially in scientific contexts and in countries that use the metric system.\n\n2. **Fahrenheit (\u00b0F)**\n   - Origin: Devised by Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit in 1724. Initially based on the freezing point of a brine solution and human body temperature, it sets the freezing point of water at 32\u00b0F and boiling point at 212\u00b0F under standard atmospheric pressure.\n   - Common Usage: Primarily used in the United States and a few other countries for non-scientific applications.\n\n### Excel Table\n\nHere's the table showing the conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit:\n\n| Celsius | Fahrenheit |\n|---------|------------|\n| 0       | 32         |\n| 5       | 41         |\n| 10      | 50         |\n| 15      | 59         |\n| 20      | 68         |\n| 25      | 77         |\n| 30      | 86         |\n| 35      | 95         |\n| 40      | 104        |\n| 45      | 113        |\n| 50      | 122        |\n| 55      | 131        |\n| 60      | 140        |\n| 65      | 149        |\n| 70      | 158        |\n| 75      | 167        |\n| 80      | 176        |\n| 85      | 185        |\n| 90      | 194        |\n| 95      | 203        |\n| 100     | 212        |\n\n### Excel VBA Code\n\nBelow is a sample VBA code to perform the conversion, incorporating error handling for inputs outside a reasonable range (absolute zero to arbitrarily high values):\n\n```vba\nSub ConvertTemp()\n    Dim celsius As Double\n    Dim fahrenheit As Double\n    Dim i As Integer\n    \n    On Error GoTo ErrorHandler\n    \n    For i = 0 To 20\n        celsius = i * 5\n        If celsius >= -273.15 And celsius <= 1000 Then\n            fahrenheit = (celsius * 1.8) + 32\n            Cells(i + 1, 1).Value = celsius\n            Cells(i + 1, 2).Value = fahrenheit\n        Else\n            MsgBox \"Temperature value \" & celsius & \"\u00b0C is outside the valid range.\"\n        End If\n    Next i\n    \n    Exit Sub\n    \nErrorHandler:\n    MsgBox \"An unexpected error has occurred. Please check your input and try again.\"\n    \nEnd Sub\n```\n\n### Notes on the Code:\n- **Error Handling**: The `On Error GoTo ErrorHandler` statement is used to catch any errors that might occur during execution and redirect them to a labeled `ErrorHandler` block.\n- **Range Check**: The code checks if the Celsius value is within a valid physical range (from absolute zero to 1000\u00b0C) before performing the conversion.\n- **Loop**: The `For` loop iterates through increments of 5\u00b0C from 0\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C.\n\nThis VBA script will populate your Excel sheet, starting from the first column, with Celsius values and their corresponding Fahrenheit conversions."
