I often index numpy arrays (matrices) with brackets, but when I want to slice an array (matrix) I must use the comma notation. I am seeing unexpected behavior when using brackets for slicing. For example:\n\n```python\n>>> x = numpy.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])\n>>> x[1][1]\n4                 # expected behavior\n>>> x[1,1]\n4                 # expected behavior\n>>> x[:][1]\narray([3, 4])     # unexpected behavior?\n>>> x[:,1]\narray([2, 4, 6])  # expected behavior\n```\nWhy is this happening?"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is due to how NumPy handles indexing and slicing with different notations. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Single Bracket Indexing (`[]`)**:\n   - When you use single brackets with an integer index like `x[1]`, you are accessing the first dimension of the array and getting the entire row at index 1. This returns a sub-array (a row in this case).\n   - When you further index like `x[1][1]`, you are performing a separate indexing operation on the result of `x[1]`. This means you're accessing the second element of the row that was returned by `x[1]`.\n\n2. **Comma Notation (`[,]`)**:\n   - This is the preferred method when working with multi-dimensional arrays in NumPy. Using a comma allows you to specify indices for each dimension simultaneously.\n   - For example, `x[1,1]` directly accesses the element at row 1, column 1.\n\n3. **Slicing with Single Bracket (`[:]`)**:\n   - When you do `x[:]`, it returns a view of the whole array, essentially not slicing along any dimension.\n   - Therefore, `x[:][1]` first returns the whole array (like `x[:]`), and then applies `[1]` to it, which results in the second row, `array([3, 4])`.\n\n4. **Slicing with Comma Notation (`[:,]`)**:\n   - Using `x[:,1]`, you're slicing along the first dimension (rows) and accessing the second column across all rows. This is why you get `array([2, 4, 6])`.\n\nTo avoid confusion and unexpected behavior, especially with multi-dimensional arrays, it's generally recommended to use the comma notation for indexing and slicing, as it allows you to clearly specify your intentions for each dimension."
