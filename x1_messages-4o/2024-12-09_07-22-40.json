        "content": "The issue you're encountering stems from the use of `filter_by`, which is designed for simpler equality checks, and you're trying to use it with an inequality. Also, the syntax for checking `None` values needs to be adjusted. In SQLAlchemy, when you want to check for inequality or perform more complex queries, you should use `filter` instead of `filter_by`.\n\nHere's how you can modify your query to return all seats where the invite is not `None`:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import not_, or_\n\nseats = Seat.query.filter(Seat.invite != None).all()\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `is not` operator, which is more idiomatic for checking against `None`:\n\n```python\nseats = Seat.query.filter(Seat.invite.isnot(None)).all()\n```\n\nBoth of these approaches will give you all the `Seat` instances where the `invite` attribute is not `None`. Make sure to import any necessary functions or classes from SQLAlchemy as needed."
