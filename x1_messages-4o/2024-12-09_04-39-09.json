        "content": "In CUDA, \"coalesced\" refers to the efficient access pattern of global memory by threads in a warp. Global memory transactions are considered coalesced when they are combined into as few transactions as possible, minimizing memory bandwidth usage and improving performance.\n\nMemory coalescing is achieved when threads in a warp access memory in a pattern that allows the memory controller to group these accesses into fewer transactions. This typically involves threads accessing contiguous memory locations. For example, if each thread in a warp accesses consecutive elements in an array, the memory accesses can be coalesced into a single transaction.\n\nIn the context of matrices, whether accessing row by row or column by column is coalesced depends on how the matrix is stored in memory. In CUDA, matrices are typically stored in row-major order, meaning consecutive elements of a row are placed next to each other in memory.\n\n- **Row by Row Access**: When accessing the matrix row by row, threads in a warp can access consecutive elements of a row, which leads to coalesced memory accesses. This is generally efficient and preferred.\n\n- **Column by Column Access**: Accessing a matrix column by column can lead to non-coalesced memory accesses, as elements of a column are not stored contiguously in memory when using row-major ordering. This results in each thread accessing elements that are not next to each other, leading to multiple memory transactions.\n\nTherefore, in the CUDA programming guide matrix example, when the term \"coalesced\" is used, it typically refers to accessing the matrix row by row, as this access pattern aligns with the row-major storage order of the matrix and allows for coalesced memory transactions. This is why accessing matrices row by row is usually more efficient in CUDA."
