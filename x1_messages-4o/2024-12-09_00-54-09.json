        "content": "I have a piece of code that works as expected in both Python 2.5 and 3.0, where I assign values to variables 'a', 'b', and 'c' and then print them in a function 'test'. However, when I try to increment the value of 'c' in the function, I get an 'UnboundLocalError: 'c' not assigned' at the line where I print 'c'. Why is there a runtime error raised at the line where I print 'c' because of a later statement where I increment 'c'? And why are variables 'a' and 'b' printed as expected, while 'print(c)' raises an error? Here's the code:\n\n```\na, b, c = (1, 2, 3)\n\nprint(a, b, c)\n\ndef test():\n    print(a)\n    print(b)\n    print(c)    # (A)\n    #c+=1       # (B)\ntest()\n```\nI'm guessing that the assignment 'c+=1' creates a local variable 'c', which takes precedence over the global 'c'. But how can a variable \"steal\" scope before it exists? Why is 'c' apparently local here?"

        "content": "The behavior you're encountering is due to Python's scoping rules and how it handles the assignment of variables within a function. Let's break it down:\n\n### Understanding the Error\n\n1. **Scope of Variables:**\n   - In Python, when you assign a value to a variable inside a function, Python treats that variable as a local variable by default.\n   - Even if the assignment is not executed (because it is commented out or later in the code), the presence of an assignment operation (`c += 1`) tells Python that `c` will be a local variable throughout the function.\n\n2. **UnboundLocalError:**\n   - When you execute `print(c)` inside the `test()` function, Python looks for a local variable `c` to reference since it has been told there will be a local `c` due to the assignment operation.\n   - Since there is no local assignment before `print(c)`, Python raises an `UnboundLocalError`, stating that you're trying to use a local variable `c` that hasn't been assigned a value yet.\n\n3. **Why `a` and `b` Work:**\n   - Variables `a` and `b` do not have any in-function assignments or modifications, so Python uses their global values without any issue.\n\n### Solution\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to explicitly tell Python that you want to use the global variable `c` inside the `test()` function. You can do this by using the `global` keyword:\n\n```python\na, b, c = (1, 2, 3)\n\nprint(a, b, c)\n\ndef test():\n    global c     # Declare 'c' as a global variable.\n    print(a)\n    print(b)\n    print(c)    # This will now correctly reference the global 'c'.\n    c += 1      # Increment the global 'c'.\n\ntest()\n```\n\nBy declaring `c` as a `global` variable within the function, you're telling Python to use the `c` defined outside the function, allowing you to both reference and modify it without encountering an `UnboundLocalError`."
