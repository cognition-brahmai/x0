In this csv-file, the string \"null\" is used as an actual data value and should not be treated as a missing value. However, when I read the file using pandas, it is treating \"null\" as NaN. How can I have pandas treat \"null\" as a normal string and not as a missing value? \n\nHere is a sample of the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom io import StringIO\n\ndata = u'strings,numbers\\nfoo,1\\nbar,2\\nnull,3'\nprint(pd.read_csv(StringIO(data)))\n```\n\nThe output I'm getting is:\n\n```python\n  strings  numbers\n0     foo        1\n1     bar        2\n2     NaN        3\n```\n\nI want the string \"null\" to be treated as a regular string, not as NaN. The file can be assumed to not contain any missing values."

        "content": "To ensure that the string \"null\" is treated as a regular string and not as a missing value (NaN) in your DataFrame, you can specify the `na_values` parameter in the `pd.read_csv()` function to exclude \"null\" from being interpreted as a missing value. By setting `na_values` to an empty list, you prevent any value from being treated as NaN. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom io import StringIO\n\ndata = u'strings,numbers\\nfoo,1\\nbar,2\\nnull,3'\n\n# Specify na_values as an empty list to prevent any string from being treated as NaN\ndf = pd.read_csv(StringIO(data), na_values=[])\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nWith this code, \"null\" will be treated as a regular string, and your output will be:\n\n```python\n  strings  numbers\n0     foo        1\n1     bar        2\n2    null        3\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that \"null\" is not recognized as a missing value and is preserved as is in your DataFrame."
