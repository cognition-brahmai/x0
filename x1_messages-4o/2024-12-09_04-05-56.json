        "content": "To convert a URI path to a filesystem path in a platform-independent manner, you can use the `pathlib` module, which is part of the Python standard library. Specifically, the `pathlib.PurePath` class can be used to handle such conversions. The `urllib.parse` module is also helpful for parsing URIs.\n\nHere's a general approach to convert a URI to a filesystem path:\n\n```python\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse\nfrom pathlib import PurePath\n\ndef uri_to_path(uri):\n    # Parse the URI\n    parsed_uri = urlparse(uri)\n    \n    # Extract the path component and unquote it\n    path = PurePath(parsed_uri.path)\n    \n    # Convert to the appropriate filesystem path\n    # On Windows, the drive letter is included in the netloc part\n    if parsed_uri.scheme == 'file':\n        if parsed_uri.netloc:\n            # Handle Windows UNC paths\n            return PurePath(f\"//{parsed_uri.netloc}{path}\")\n        else:\n            return PurePath(path)\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Only file URIs are supported\")\n\n# Example usage\nuri = \"file:///C:/Users/Example/Documents/file.txt\"\nfile_path = uri_to_path(uri)\nprint(\"Filesystem path:\", file_path)\n```\n\nThis example handles `file` URIs. The `urlparse` function extracts the path and any relevant network location (for example, a drive letter on Windows), and `PurePath` helps convert these into a platform-independent path. Adjust the function as needed if you encounter different URI schemes or specific requirements for your filesystem."
