The rest should be saved to a file without being shown in the notebook, as this significantly slows down the process. Here is a minimal working example for a Jupyter notebook:\n\n```python\n%matplotlib inline \nfrom numpy.random import randn\nfrom matplotlib.pyplot import plot, figure\na=randn(3)\nb=randn(3)\nfor i in range(10):\n    fig=figure()\n    plot(b)\n    fname='s%03d.png'%i\n    fig.savefig(fname)\n    if(i%5==0):\n        figure()\n        plot(a)\n```\n\nIn this code, I have two types of plots, a and b. I want the 'a' plots to be displayed and the 'b' plots to be saved to a file without being displayed. I hope this will speed up the process and prevent my notebook from being cluttered with figures I don't need to see. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To prevent certain plots from displaying in a Jupyter notebook while still saving them to files, you can use the `matplotlib`'s object-oriented interface and explicitly close the figures you don't want to display. This way, you can save the plots as files without rendering them in the notebook.\n\nHere is how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\n%matplotlib inline\nfrom numpy.random import randn\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\na = randn(3)\nb = randn(3)\n\nfor i in range(10):\n    # Create a figure for plot 'b' and save it without displaying\n    fig_b, ax_b = plt.subplots()\n    ax_b.plot(b)\n    fname = 's%03d.png' % i\n    fig_b.savefig(fname)\n    plt.close(fig_b)  # Close the figure to prevent it from displaying\n\n    # Create a figure for plot 'a' and display it\n    if i % 5 == 0:\n        fig_a, ax_a = plt.subplots()\n        ax_a.plot(a)\n        plt.show()  # This will display the 'a' plot in the notebook\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`plt.subplots()`**: This function is used to create a figure and a set of subplots. By using this, you get a `Figure` and `Axes` object which allows more control over the plotting.\n- **`plt.close(fig)`**: This closes the specified figure. By closing the figure after saving, you ensure that it doesn't get displayed in the notebook.\n- **`plt.show()`**: This explicitly displays the plots you want to show in the notebook.\n\nBy following this approach, you will only display the plots associated with `a` and save the plots associated with `b` without displaying them, thus keeping your notebook cleaner and possibly speeding up the execution."
