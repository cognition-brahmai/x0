In the prompt, the result of sys.path is as follows:\n\n```\n['', '/home/usrname/anaconda3/lib/python36.zip',\n '/home/usrname/anaconda3/lib/python3.6',\n '/home/usrname/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/lib-dynload',\n '/home/usrname/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages']\n```\nAt this point, there are no errors when I import torch modules. However, in the Jupyter Notebook (executed in Chrome), the sys.path is:\n\n```\n['',\n '/home/usrname/anaconda3/lib/python36.zip',\n '/home/usrname/anaconda3/lib/python3.6',\n '/home/usrname/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/lib-dynload',\n '/home/usrname/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages',\n '/home/usrname/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/IPython/extensions',\n '/home/usrname/.ipython']\n```\nAfter this, I receive an error that reads: \"No module named 'torch'\". How can I solve this problem?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely due to the Jupyter Notebook not using the same Python environment as the one where PyTorch is installed. Here's how you can resolve this problem:\n\n1. **Ensure the Jupyter Notebook is installed in the correct environment:**\n\n   First, make sure Jupyter is installed in the same Conda environment where you installed PyTorch. You can do this by activating your environment and installing Jupyter:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda activate your_env_name\n   conda install jupyter\n   ```\n\n2. **Add the Conda environment to Jupyter Notebook:**\n\n   You can add your Conda environment as a kernel in Jupyter so that you can select it when you run a notebook. To do this, install the `ipykernel` package and create a new kernel:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda activate your_env_name\n   conda install ipykernel\n   python -m ipykernel install --user --name your_env_name --display-name \"Python (your_env_name)\"\n   ```\n\n   Replace `your_env_name` with the name of your environment. This will make the environment available as an option in the Jupyter Notebook's kernel list.\n\n3. **Select the correct kernel in Jupyter Notebook:**\n\n   - Open your Jupyter Notebook.\n   - Go to the \"Kernel\" menu.\n   - Select \"Change Kernel\".\n   - Choose the kernel that corresponds to your environment, which you named \"Python (your_env_name)\".\n\n4. **Verify installation:**\n\n   Once you've switched to the correct kernel, try importing `torch` again to see if the issue is resolved.\n\n5. **Update your IPython kernel:**\n\n   If the issue persists, you can try updating the IPython kernel within your environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda activate your_env_name\n   conda update ipykernel\n   ```\n\nAfter following these steps, your Jupyter Notebook should be able to import the `torch` module without any issues."
