I am trying to install a specific version of a third-party library, but the latest version has backwards incompatible changes.

        "content": "To list all the available versions of a Python package that can be installed using pip, you can use the `pip` command with the `--versions` option in combination with the `pip index versions` command. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Open your command line interface (CLI) or terminal.\n\n2. Run the following command, replacing `package-name` with the name of the package you're interested in:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install package-name==random\n   ```\n\n   This will fail, but it will output a list of all the available versions of the package to the console. Look for a message that contains \"from versions:\" followed by the list of available versions.\n\n3. Alternatively, you can use the `pip index versions` command which might be more convenient and straightforward:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip index versions package-name\n   ```\n\nThis will list all the available versions of the specified package from the Python Package Index (PyPI).\n\nOnce you have the list of versions, you can choose a specific version to install by using the `==` syntax with `pip install`. For example, to install version `1.2.3` of `package-name`, you would run:\n\n```bash\npip install package-name==1.2.3\n```\n\nThis way, you can test different versions to find the one compatible with your requirements."
