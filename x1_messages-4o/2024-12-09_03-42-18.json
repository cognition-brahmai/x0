        "content": "In Python, the decision to implement `__str__()` vs `__unicode__()` depends on the version of Python you are using, as well as the intended use of your class.\n\n1. **Python 2**: \n    - In Python 2, `str` and `unicode` are distinct types. The `__str__()` method is used to define a byte string representation of an object, whereas `__unicode__()` is used for the Unicode string representation.\n    - If your application or library needs to handle Unicode strings, it's a good practice to implement both `__str__()` and `__unicode__()`. You can use the `__unicode__()` method to return a Unicode string and the `__str__()` method to return an encoded version of the Unicode string (often using UTF-8).\n    - Typically, `__str__()` would return `unicode(self).encode('utf-8')`.\n\n2. **Python 3**:\n    - In Python 3, `str` is Unicode by default, and `bytes` is used for binary data. The `__str__()` method should return a Unicode string, and there is no `__unicode__()` method in Python 3.\n    - For Python 3, you only need to implement `__str__()` to provide a human-readable string representation of your object.\n\n3. **Compatibility Between Python 2 and 3**:\n    - If you need to support both Python 2 and 3, you can use a library like `six` to provide compatibility. In this case, you would typically implement `__unicode__()` for Python 2, and have `__str__()` call `__unicode__()` and encode its result for Python 2. In Python 3, just implement `__str__()`.\n\nIn general, the need to implement both is more relevant to Python 2. In Python 3, you should focus on implementing `__str__()`. If you are developing new applications and libraries, it's recommended to use Python 3 and just implement `__str__()`, as Python 2 has reached the end of its life and is no longer supported."
