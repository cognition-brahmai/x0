However, the `labels` are not in one-hot vector format. When I print the size of `labels` and `outputs`, I get `torch.Size([4])` and `torch.Size([4, 10])` respectively. Surprisingly, when I pass the `labels` and `outputs` to `criterion=CrossEntropyLoss()`, there are no errors. I hypothesized that PyTorch might automatically convert the `labels` into one-hot vector form, so I tried to convert `labels` to a one-hot vector before passing it to the loss function. However, I encountered a RuntimeError: 'multi-target not supported'. Does PyTorch not support one-hot vectors? How does PyTorch compute the cross entropy for two tensors `outputs = [1,0,0],[0,0,1]` and `labels = [0,2]`?"

        "content": "PyTorch does support the concept of one-hot vectors, but it handles them differently when it comes to loss functions like `CrossEntropyLoss`. Here's a breakdown of how PyTorch handles this situation:\n\n1. **`CrossEntropyLoss` Expectations**: \n   - The `outputs` tensor should contain raw, unnormalized scores for each class (also known as logits), and its shape should be `[N, C]`, where `N` is the batch size and `C` is the number of classes.\n   - The `labels` tensor should contain the class indices, not one-hot vectors. Its shape should be `[N]`, where each element is a class index ranging from `0` to `C-1`.\n\n2. **Automatic Handling**:\n   - When you pass the `outputs` and `labels` to `CrossEntropyLoss`, PyTorch expects `labels` to be class indices rather than one-hot encoded vectors. This is why your code works without error when `labels` has a shape of `[4]` and contains values like `[0, 2]`.\n   - Internally, `CrossEntropyLoss` combines `LogSoftmax` and `NLLLoss` (Negative Log Likelihood Loss). It computes the softmax of the `outputs` to get probabilities and then uses the `labels` to select the log-probability of the correct class for each example in the batch.\n\n3. **Error with One-Hot Labels**:\n   - If you try to pass one-hot encoded vectors as `labels`, you'll get a `RuntimeError: 'multi-target not supported'` because `CrossEntropyLoss` doesn't expect one-hot vectors. It expects a single integer class label for each example.\n\n4. **Example Calculation**:\n   - For `outputs = [[1,0,0], [0,0,1]]` and `labels = [0,2]`, `CrossEntropyLoss` will:\n     - Compute the softmax of each row in `outputs` to get probabilities.\n     - For the first example (`[1,0,0]` and label `0`), it will compute `-log(softmax[0])`, where `softmax[0]` is the probability of class 0.\n     - For the second example (`[0,0,1]` and label `2`), it will compute `-log(softmax[2])`, where `softmax[2]` is the probability of class 2.\n     - The final loss is the average of these log-probabilities.\n\nIn summary, PyTorch's `CrossEntropyLoss` is designed to work with class indices directly rather than one-hot encoded vectors, which simplifies the process and avoids unnecessary conversions."
