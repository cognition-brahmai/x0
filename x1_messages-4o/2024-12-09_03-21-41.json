        "content": "In Python, iterators do not provide direct access to the \"current\" item without moving the iterator forward. However, you can work around this limitation by keeping track of the current item manually. One approach is to use a lookahead approach, where you store the current value separately and only update it when you advance the iterator. Here's how you can implement your example using this approach:\n\n```python\nlooking_for = iter(when_to_change_the_mode)\n\n# Initialize current with the first item of the iterator\ntry:\n    current_item = next(looking_for)\nexcept StopIteration:\n    # Handle the case where looking_for is empty\n    current_item = None\n\nfor l in listA:\n    # Use current_item as the current element pointed by the iterator\n    do_something(current_item)\n    if l == current_item:\n        # Advance the iterator and update current_item\n        try:\n            current_item = next(looking_for)\n        except StopIteration:\n            # End of iteration, no more items to look for\n            current_item = None\n```\n\nIn this implementation, `current_item` holds the current value pointed at by the iterator. The `next()` function is used to advance the iterator and update `current_item` only when necessary. This way, you can access the current item without incrementing the iterator itself until you explicitly choose to do so."
