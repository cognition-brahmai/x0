I'm trying to check if a key `myProperty` exists within the `settings` dictionary in my template and, if it does exist, I want to perform a specific action. Currently, I'm trying to use the `hasKey` method, but it's not working. What is the correct method or equivalent to `hasKey` in Jinja2?\n\n```python\nsettings = {\n   \"foo\" : \"baz\",\n   \"hello\" : \"world\"\n}\n```\n\n```jinja\n{% if settings.hasKey(myProperty) %}\n   takeSomeAction();\n{% endif %}\n```"

        "content": "In Jinja2, there isn't a method called `hasKey` for checking the existence of a key in a dictionary. Instead, you can use the `in` operator to check if a key exists in a dictionary. Here's how you can modify your template to check for the existence of `myProperty` in the `settings` dictionary:\n\n```jinja\n{% if myProperty in settings %}\n   takeSomeAction();\n{% endif %}\n```\n\nThis will evaluate to `True` if `myProperty` is a key in the `settings` dictionary, and the block inside the `if` statement will be executed. Make sure that `myProperty` is defined and contains the key you are checking for. If `myProperty` is a variable that holds the name of the key, you can use it directly as shown above."
