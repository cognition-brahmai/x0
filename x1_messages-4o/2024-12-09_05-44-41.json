I am using the following code:\n\n```python\nmyDict = {}\nmyDict[2000]['hello'] = 50\n```\n\nI would like to get the output `50` when I pass `myDict[2000]['hello']` but I am encountering a KeyError. I am confused as to why Python isn't just creating these entries right away. I was under the impression that KeyError only occurs when you try to access an entry that doesn't exist, but I am creating it here. Can you explain what the issue is and how to get around it?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that you're trying to access a dictionary entry that doesn't exist before assigning a value to it. In Python, you cannot directly assign a value to a nested dictionary key if the parent dictionary key does not exist yet.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the problem with your code:\n\n```python\nmyDict = {}\nmyDict[2000]['hello'] = 50\n```\n\n1. Initially, `myDict` is an empty dictionary.\n2. You try to access `myDict[2000]` and assign `['hello'] = 50` to it. However, `myDict[2000]` does not exist yet, hence the `KeyError`.\n\nTo solve this problem, you need to first initialize `myDict[2000]` as an empty dictionary before trying to assign a value to `['hello']`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nmyDict = {}\nmyDict[2000] = {}        # Initialize myDict[2000] as an empty dictionary\nmyDict[2000]['hello'] = 50\n\n# Now you can access the value\nprint(myDict[2000]['hello'])  # Output: 50\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use a `defaultdict` from the `collections` module, which can automatically create a dictionary if a key does not exist:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nmyDict = defaultdict(dict)\nmyDict[2000]['hello'] = 50\n\n# Now you can access the value\nprint(myDict[2000]['hello'])  # Output: 50\n```\n\nUsing `defaultdict` can be particularly useful if you anticipate needing to handle many nested dictionaries and want to avoid manually checking and initializing each one."
