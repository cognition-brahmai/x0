The code I'm using is as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom socket import *\n\nserverName = '127.0.0.1'\nserverPort = 12000\nclientSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)\nmessage = input('Input lowercase sentence:')\nclientSocket.sendto(message,(serverName, serverPort))\nmodifiedMessage, serverAddress = clientSocket.recvfrom(2048)\nprint (modifiedMessage)\nclientSocket.close()\n```\n\nWhen I run this code and input a sentence, I get the following error:\n\n```python\nInput lowercase sentence:fdsgfdf\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"C:\\srinath files\\NETWORKS\\UDPclient.py\", line 6, in &lt;module&gt;\n    clientSocket.sendto(message,(serverName, serverPort))\nTypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'\n```\n\nWhat can I do to solve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is because the `sendto` method of a socket expects the data to be sent in bytes format, but the `input` function in Python returns a string. To fix this issue, you need to convert the string to bytes before sending it over the socket. This can be done using the `encode` method. Here's the corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nfrom socket import *\n\nserverName = '127.0.0.1'\nserverPort = 12000\nclientSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)\nmessage = input('Input lowercase sentence: ')\n# Convert the message to bytes\nclientSocket.sendto(message.encode(), (serverName, serverPort))\nmodifiedMessage, serverAddress = clientSocket.recvfrom(2048)\n# Decode the received bytes back to a string\nprint(modifiedMessage.decode())\nclientSocket.close()\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n1. **Encoding the Message**: When sending the message, use `message.encode()` to convert the string to bytes. By default, `encode()` uses UTF-8 encoding, which is generally suitable for most cases.\n\n2. **Decoding the Received Message**: When receiving the message, use `modifiedMessage.decode()` to convert the received bytes back into a string for printing or further processing.\n\nThese changes should resolve the `TypeError` and allow your UDP client to communicate correctly."
