For instance, I would like to convert the string \"how much for the maple syrup? $20.99? That's ricidulous!!!\" into \"how much for the maple syrup 20 99 That s ridiculous\". Could you provide me with a solution to accomplish this?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this by using Python's `re` module, which allows you to work with regular expressions. You can create a regular expression pattern to match any non-word character and replace it with a space. Here's a simple solution to accomplish that:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef replace_symbols_with_spaces(input_string):\n    # Use regex to replace non-word characters with a space\n    transformed_string = re.sub(r'\\W+', ' ', input_string)\n    # Strip leading and trailing spaces and return the result\n    return transformed_string.strip()\n\n# Your input string\ninput_string = \"how much for the maple syrup? $20.99? That's ridiculous!!!\"\n\n# Transform the string\noutput_string = replace_symbols_with_spaces(input_string)\n\nprint(output_string)\n```\n\nThis script uses the `\\W+` pattern, which matches one or more non-word characters (anything other than letters, digits, and underscores) and replaces them with a space. It then strips any leading or trailing spaces from the resulting string. The output will be:\n\n```\nhow much for the maple syrup 20 99 That s ridiculous\n```\n\nThis will replace all symbols with spaces as you wanted."
