        "content": "The riddle you're referring to describes a \"coin.\" A coin has a \"head\" and a \"tail,\" which are the two sides of the coin. It doesn't have a \"body\" in the sense that it is flat and not a living creature. The part about speaking without a mouth is more metaphorical; coins can tell a story or represent value, serving as a medium of exchange. Coins are found in various habitats, such as pockets, wallets, and cash registers, and are often overlooked due to their small size and ubiquitous presence."
