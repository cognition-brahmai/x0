        "content": "I am using scikit-learn to tune a model's hyperparameters using GridSearchCV and a pipeline. I am chaining the preprocessing with the estimator using the pipeline. In my case, the preprocessing is time consuming and I am not tuning any parameters of it. Currently, the preprocessing is being executed multiple times, once for each different value of the parameter C. Since the preprocessing stage returns the same output for different values of C, it would be more efficient to compute it once, then run the estimator part of the pipeline. I could manually split the pipeline between the preprocessing and the estimator, but I would then have to implement the splits manually, and not use GridSearchCV at all. Is there a simple or standard way to avoid repeating the preprocessing while using GridSearchCV?\n\nHere is my current code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n\ngrid = GridSearchCV(make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), LogisticRegression()),\n                    param_grid={'logisticregression__C': [0.1, 10.]},\n                    cv=2,\n                    refit=False)\n\n_ = grid.fit(X=np.random.rand(10, 3),\n             y=np.random.randint(2, size=(10,)))\n```"

        "content": "To avoid repeating the preprocessing steps while using `GridSearchCV`, you can use `sklearn`'s `FunctionTransformer` in conjunction with `Pipeline`. This allows you to perform preprocessing once and reuse its results in the grid search. Here\u2019s how you can achieve this:\n\n1. Perform the preprocessing step separately and transform the data.\n2. Use the transformed data in the pipeline with `GridSearchCV`.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, FunctionTransformer\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n\n# Assuming X and y are your dataset\nX = np.random.rand(10, 3)\ny = np.random.randint(2, size=(10,))\n\n# Preprocess the data once\nscaler = StandardScaler()\nX_transformed = scaler.fit_transform(X)\n\n# Define a pipeline with a dummy transformer\npipeline = make_pipeline(\n    FunctionTransformer(lambda x: x, validate=True),  # Pass-through transformer\n    LogisticRegression()\n)\n\n# Define the grid search with transformed data\ngrid = GridSearchCV(\n    pipeline,\n    param_grid={'logisticregression__C': [0.1, 10.]},\n    cv=2,\n    refit=False\n)\n\n# Fit the grid search\ngrid.fit(X_transformed, y)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **FunctionTransformer**: This is used as a pass-through transformer that allows us to insert the preprocessed data directly into the pipeline without any further transformation.\n- **StandardScaler**: It's applied separately on the data `X` before passing it to the `GridSearchCV`.\n- **GridSearchCV**: Uses the preprocessed data `X_transformed` directly, thus avoiding redundant computations.\n\nThis approach ensures that the preprocessing step is only performed once and not repeated for each parameter setting in the grid search."
