Suppose I have an Event model as shown below, and I want to test the method `Event.is_over()` by creating an Event that ends in the future (today + 1 or something), and stubbing the date and time so the system thinks we've reached that future date. How do I stub all system time objects as far as Python is concerned, including `datetime.date.today()`, `datetime.datetime.now()`, and any other standard date/time objects? What's the standard way to do this?\n\n```\nfrom django.db import models\nimport datetime\n\nclass Event(models.Model):\n    date_start = models.DateField()\n    date_end = models.DateField()\n\n    def is_over(self):\n        return datetime.date.today() > self.date_end\n```"

        "content": "To perform Django unit testing with date/time-based objects, you can use the `freezegun` library, which is a popular tool for \"freezing\" time in your tests. This allows you to manipulate the perceived current time, making it ideal for testing time-dependent code.\n\nHere's how you can use `freezegun` to test the `Event.is_over()` method:\n\n1. **Install Freezegun**: First, you need to install the `freezegun` library. You can do this via pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install freezegun\n   ```\n\n2. **Update Your Test Case**: Use the `@freeze_time` decorator or `freeze_time` context manager to set the current time for your test. Here's an example of how to test the `Event.is_over()` method:\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom freezegun import freeze_time\nfrom myapp.models import Event\nimport datetime\n\nclass EventModelTest(TestCase):\n\n    def test_event_is_over(self):\n        # Set the start and end dates for the Event\n        start_date = datetime.date.today()\n        end_date = start_date + datetime.timedelta(days=1)\n\n        # Create an Event instance\n        event = Event.objects.create(date_start=start_date, date_end=end_date)\n\n        # Use freezegun to \"freeze\" time to the day after the event ends\n        with freeze_time(end_date + datetime.timedelta(days=1)):\n            self.assertTrue(event.is_over())\n\n        # Use freezegun to \"freeze\" time to the day of the event end\n        with freeze_time(end_date):\n            self.assertFalse(event.is_over())\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`freezegun` Decorator/Context Manager**: This is used to control the current time perceived by the code under test. It ensures that all calls to `datetime.date.today()`, `datetime.datetime.now()`, and other date/time functions return the \"frozen\" time.\n- **Creating an Event**: An `Event` is created with a `date_start` of today and a `date_end` one day in the future.\n- **Testing the Method**: By freezing time to the day after the event's `date_end`, the `is_over()` method should return `True`. Conversely, when time is frozen to the `date_end` itself, the method should return `False`.\n\nThis approach ensures that your tests are deterministic and independent of the actual current date and time, which is crucial for reliable unit testing."
