For example, in the following two code snippets, the first uses `SystemExit` while the second uses `sys.exit`:\n\n```python\nref = osgeo.ogr.Open(reference)\nif ref is None:\n    raise SystemExit('Unable to open %s' % reference)\n```\nand\n```python\nref = osgeo.ogr.Open(reference)\nif ref is None:\n    print('Unable to open %s' % reference)\n    sys.exit(-1)\n```"

        "content": "In Python, both `sys.exit()` and `SystemExit` are used for terminating a program, but they are used in slightly different contexts and have different implications:\n\n1. **`sys.exit()`**:\n   - `sys.exit()` is a function in the `sys` module that raises the `SystemExit` exception. When called, it attempts to exit the program by raising the `SystemExit` exception.\n   - You can pass an integer or a string as an argument to `sys.exit()`. An integer is treated as the exit status of the process (0 usually means a successful termination, while any non-zero value indicates an error). A string will be printed to the stderr before exiting.\n   - It is commonly used when you want to exit a program from within a function or script, and it provides a clean and standard way to terminate a Python program.\n\n2. **`SystemExit`**:\n   - `SystemExit` is an exception class that is raised by `sys.exit()`, but you can also raise it directly using `raise SystemExit('message')`.\n   - Raising `SystemExit` directly allows you to provide a message or exit code, similar to `sys.exit()`.\n   - Using `raise SystemExit()` is more explicit and is typically used when you want to emphasize that the exit is due to an exceptional situation or error condition.\n\n### When to Use Each\n\n- **Use `sys.exit()`** when you are writing scripts or functions and want a straightforward way to exit the program with a specific exit status or message. It is a common practice in scripting and is easier to read for those familiar with Python.\n\n- **Use `raise SystemExit()`** when you want to explicitly indicate that an exit is due to an error or exceptional condition. This approach can be useful in larger applications where exceptions are managed and caught, and you want to clearly signal that the program should terminate.\n\n### Example Explanation\n\nIn your examples:\n\n1. **Using `raise SystemExit('Unable to open %s' % reference)`**:\n   - This directly raises the `SystemExit` exception with a message. It's explicit and clearly indicates that the program is terminating due to the inability to open the file.\n\n2. **Using `sys.exit(-1)`**:\n   - This calls the `sys.exit()` function with an exit code of `-1`, which is a common convention to indicate an error. The message is printed separately before calling `sys.exit()`. This is slightly more idiomatic for scripting and is useful if you want to separate the printing of the message from the actual exit call.\n\nIn general, both approaches are correct, but `sys.exit()` is more commonly used in scripts for its simplicity and readability."
