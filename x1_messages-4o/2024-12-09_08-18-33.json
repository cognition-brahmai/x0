        "content": "I am following a tutorial on calculating document similarity using tf-idf-cosine in Python. However, the tutorial does not include the final section on using cosine similarity to actually find the distance between two documents. I have implemented the code from the tutorial and generated some output, but I am not sure how to use this output to calculate cosine similarity. I know how to implement cosine similarity with respect to two vectors of similar length, but in this case, I am unsure how to identify the two vectors. The code I have implemented is as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfTransformer\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nimport numpy as np\nimport numpy.linalg as LA\n\ntrain_set = [\"The sky is blue.\", \"The sun is bright.\"]  # Documents\ntest_set = [\"The sun in the sky is bright.\"]  # Query\nstopWords = stopwords.words('english')\n\nvectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words = stopWords)\ntransformer = TfidfTransformer()\n\ntrainVectorizerArray = vectorizer.fit_transform(train_set).toarray()\ntestVectorizerArray = vectorizer.transform(test_set).toarray()\nprint 'Fit Vectorizer to train set', trainVectorizerArray\nprint 'Transform Vectorizer to test set', testVectorizerArray\n\ntransformer.fit(trainVectorizerArray)\nprint\nprint transformer.transform(trainVectorizerArray).toarray()\n\ntransformer.fit(testVectorizerArray)\nprint \ntfidf = transformer.transform(testVectorizerArray)\nprint tfidf.todense()\n```\n\nThe output I have generated is as follows:\n\n```\nFit Vectorizer to train set [[1 0 1 0]\n [0 1 0 1]]\nTransform Vectorizer to test set [[0 1 1 1]]\n\n[[ 0.70710678  0.          0.70710678  0.        ]\n [ 0.          0.70710678  0.          0.70710678]]\n\n[[ 0.          0.57735027  0.57735027  0.57735027]]\n```\n\nHow can I use this output to calculate cosine similarity?"

        "content": "To calculate the cosine similarity between the documents in your training set and the test set, you need to compute the dot product of their TF-IDF vectors and then divide by the product of their magnitudes (Euclidean norms).\n\nHere's how you can calculate the cosine similarity using the TF-IDF vectors you've generated:\n\n1. **Compute the Dot Product:** The dot product of two vectors \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   A \\cdot B = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i \\times B_i\n   \\]\n\n2. **Compute the Magnitude of Each Vector:** The magnitude (or Euclidean norm) of a vector \\(A\\) is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\|A\\| = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i^2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Cosine Similarity Formula:** Cosine similarity between two vectors \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{cosine\\_similarity} = \\frac{A \\cdot B}{\\|A\\| \\times \\|B\\|}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's apply this to your output:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# TF-IDF vectors for the train set\ntrain_tfidf = np.array([\n    [0.70710678, 0., 0.70710678, 0.],\n    [0., 0.70710678, 0., 0.70710678]\n])\n\n# TF-IDF vector for the test set\ntest_tfidf = np.array([0., 0.57735027, 0.57735027, 0.57735027])\n\n# Function to calculate cosine similarity\ndef cosine_similarity(vec1, vec2):\n    dot_product = np.dot(vec1, vec2)\n    magnitude = LA.norm(vec1) * LA.norm(vec2)\n    if not magnitude:\n        return 0\n    return dot_product / magnitude\n\n# Calculate cosine similarity for each train document against the test document\nsimilarity_scores = [cosine_similarity(test_tfidf, train_vec) for train_vec in train_tfidf]\n\nfor i, score in enumerate(similarity_scores):\n    print(f\"Cosine similarity between test document and train document {i+1}: {score}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The `train_tfidf` array contains the TF-IDF vectors for the training documents.\n- The `test_tfidf` array contains the TF-IDF vector for the test document.\n- The `cosine_similarity` function computes the cosine similarity between two vectors.\n- Finally, we iterate over each training document's TF-IDF vector, calculating the cosine similarity with the test document's TF-IDF vector.\n\nThis will give you the similarity scores indicating how similar each document in your training set is to the document in your test set."
