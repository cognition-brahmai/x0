Can you provide a list of three questions to ask the robot? \nAssume the robot is designed to classify emails as either spam or not spam based on various factors such as email content, sender, and recipient. Here are three potential questions to ask:\n1. What criteria does the robot use to classify an email as spam?\n2. How does the robot prioritize different factors when making a classification decision?\n3. How does the robot update its decision-making rules over time?"

Here are three more questions you might consider asking the robot:\n\n1. **What specific patterns or keywords in an email's content most frequently lead to a spam classification?**\n   - This question helps you identify the particular elements within the content that trigger a spam designation, which can be useful for refining rules or training data.\n\n2. **Can the robot provide examples of borderline cases where the decision was difficult?**\n   - By understanding cases where the classification is not clear-cut, you can gain insights into the limitations of the current decision-making process and identify areas for improvement.\n\n3. **How does the robot handle conflicting information from multiple factors, such as a trusted sender but suspicious content?**\n   - This question explores how the robot resolves conflicts between different criteria, which is essential for understanding its overall decision-making framework.\n\nThese questions can help you delve deeper into the robot's logic and improve its classification accuracy over time."
