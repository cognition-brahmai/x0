I have a string called message:\n\n```\nmessage = \"Hello, welcome!\\nThis is some text that should be centered!\"\n```\n\nAnd I am trying to center it with this statement:\n\n```\nprint('{:^80}'.format(message))\n```\n\nHowever, this prints:\n\n```\n           Hello, welcome!\nThis is some text that should be centered!           \n```\n\nBut, I am expecting it to look something like:\n\n```\n                                Hello, welcome!                                 \n                   This is some text that should be centered!                   \n```\n\nCan you suggest a solution?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired output where each line of the `message` is centered individually, you need to split the string into lines and then center each line separately. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nmessage = \"Hello, welcome!\\nThis is some text that should be centered!\"\n\n# Split the message into lines\nlines = message.split('\\n')\n\n# Center each line individually and print it\nfor line in lines:\n    print('{:^80}'.format(line))\n```\n\nThis code snippet will split the `message` into separate lines using `split('\\n')`, and then it will center each line using the `format` method with a width of 80. Each line will be printed centered in the terminal as intended."
