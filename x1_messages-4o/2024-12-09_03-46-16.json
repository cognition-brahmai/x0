        "content": "Python does not have a built-in function specifically for converting a matrix into its row echelon form (also known as upper triangular form). However, you can achieve this using libraries such as NumPy or SymPy, which provide functionality for matrix operations.\n\nHere is an example of how you can do this using the `SymPy` library:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Matrix\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = Matrix([\n    [1, 2, 3],\n    [4, 5, 6],\n    [7, 8, 9]\n])\n\n# Convert the matrix to row echelon form\nrow_echelon_form = matrix.rref()[0]\n\nprint(row_echelon_form)\n```\n\nIn this example, `rref()` is a method provided by SymPy that returns the reduced row echelon form of the matrix. The `[0]` index is used because `rref()` actually returns a tuple, where the first element is the matrix in row echelon form and the second element is a tuple of pivot columns.\n\nTo use SymPy, you'll need to install it first if you haven't already, using:\n\n```bash\npip install sympy\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can manually implement the Gaussian elimination process to convert a matrix to its row echelon form using basic Python constructs. However, using a library like SymPy makes the task much simpler and more efficient."
