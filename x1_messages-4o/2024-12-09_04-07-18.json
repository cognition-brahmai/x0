Is there a way to achieve this without using a loop?"

        "content": "You can achieve this using the `groupby` method along with `size`. However, since `value_counts` doesn't directly work with `groupby` on a DataFrame, you can use the `size` method on the grouped object to count the occurrences of each term within each `(id, group)` pair. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame([\n    (1, 1, 'term1'),\n    (1, 2, 'term2'),\n    (1, 1, 'term1'),\n    (1, 1, 'term2'),\n    (2, 2, 'term3'),\n    (2, 3, 'term1'),\n    (2, 2, 'term1')\n], columns=['id', 'group', 'term'])\n\n# Group by 'id', 'group', and 'term' and then use size to count occurrences\nresult = df.groupby(['id', 'group', 'term']).size().reset_index(name='count')\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will give you a DataFrame that shows the count of each term within each `(id, group)` pair:\n\n```\n   id  group   term  count\n0   1      1  term1      2\n1   1      1  term2      1\n2   1      2  term2      1\n3   2      2  term1      1\n4   2      2  term3      1\n5   2      3  term1      1\n```\n\nHere, the `groupby` method is used to group the data by `id`, `group`, and `term`, and `size` computes the size of each group, effectively counting the occurrences of each term. The `reset_index` method with `name='count'` is used to convert the resulting series back into a DataFrame with a column named 'count'."
