When I am adding or updating a 'Lab' in the Django admin, a dropdown list of all 'Authors' is automatically generated. However, this dropdown list is not alphabetically ordered which makes it difficult to navigate due to its length. How can I alphabetically order this dropdown list by the 'name' field of the 'Author' model? \n\nHere are my simplified models for reference:\n\nIn laboratory/models.py:\n\n```\nclass Lab(Model):\n    professor = ForeignKey('authors.Author')\n```\n\nIn authors/models.py:\n\n```\nclass Author(Model):\n    name = CharField(max_length=100)\n```"

        "content": "To alphabetically order the dropdown list of authors in the Django admin, you can modify the `Author` model's query set to be ordered by the `name` field. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n1. **Override the `get_queryset` method in a custom ModelAdmin class**: You can customize the query set used by the Django admin dropdown by overriding the `get_queryset` method in a custom `ModelAdmin` class for the `Lab` model.\n\n2. **Register the `Lab` model with the custom ModelAdmin**: Make sure that your `Lab` model is registered with this custom `ModelAdmin`.\n\nHere's how you can implement it:\n\nIn your `laboratory/admin.py` file (or wherever you've registered your models for the admin interface):\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom .models import Lab\nfrom authors.models import Author\n\nclass LabAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    def formfield_for_foreignkey(self, db_field, request, **kwargs):\n        if db_field.name == \"professor\":\n            kwargs[\"queryset\"] = Author.objects.order_by('name')\n        return super().formfield_for_foreignkey(db_field, request, **kwargs)\n\nadmin.site.register(Lab, LabAdmin)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **formfield_for_foreignkey**: This method is used to customize the form field for a foreign key in the admin interface. By overriding this method, you can change the queryset for the `professor` field to be ordered by the `name` attribute of the `Author` model.\n\n- **kwargs[\"queryset\"] = Author.objects.order_by('name')**: This line sets the queryset for the dropdown to be ordered by the `name` field, ensuring that the authors appear in alphabetical order.\n\nBy implementing the above code, you should see the dropdown list of authors in alphabetical order when you add or update a `Lab` in the Django admin interface."
