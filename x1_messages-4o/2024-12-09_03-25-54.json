        "content": "I am facing a struct.error: \"unpack requires a string argument of length 4\" in Python. I am trying to unpack a string using the format code \"BH\" which should require 3 bytes as per my understanding (\"B\" Unsigned char (1 byte) + \"H\" Unsigned short (2 bytes)). However, struct.calcsize(\"BH\") is reporting that it needs 4 bytes. I am using the following code: \n\n```python\nmajor, minor = struct.unpack(\"BH\", self.fp.read(3))\n```\n\nThe file size is around 800MB and this code is being used in the first few bytes of the file, so I'm sure there's data left to be read. Why am I seeing this discrepancy and how can I resolve it?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to the alignment and padding that `struct` uses when dealing with certain format codes. By default, `struct` aligns data to the natural boundaries for the format codes. In your case, the format `\"BH\"` aligns the `H` (unsigned short) to a 2-byte boundary, which can result in padding being added, hence increasing the size to 4 bytes instead of the expected 3 bytes.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can use the `'<'`, `'>'`, `'!'`, or `'='` format character at the start of your format string to specify the byte order and disable automatic alignment. For example, using `\"<BH\"` will read exactly 3 bytes with no padding.\n\nHere's how you can adjust your code:\n\n```python\nmajor, minor = struct.unpack(\"<BH\", self.fp.read(3))\n```\n\nUsing the `\"<\"` character forces little-endian byte ordering and disables alignment, ensuring that the `struct` reads exactly the number of bytes you expect (3 bytes in this case). If your data is big-endian, use `\">\"` instead. If you are unsure about the endianness of your data, you may need to check the data specification or try both options to see which one gives the correct result."
