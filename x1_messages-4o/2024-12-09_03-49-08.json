        "content": "I am attempting to plot a matrix of values using matplotlib's imshow function and I want to add gridlines to make the boundary between values clearer. However, the tick marks are positioned in the middle of each voxel. How can I a) remove the ticks but leave the label in the same location, and b) add gridlines between the pixel boundaries? Below is the code I currently have:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\nim = plt.imshow(np.reshape(np.random.rand(100), newshape=(10,10)),\n                interpolation='none', vmin=0, vmax=1, aspect='equal');\nax = plt.gca();\nax.set_xticks(np.arange(0, 10, 1));\nax.set_yticks(np.arange(0, 10, 1));\nax.set_xticklabels(np.arange(1, 11, 1));\nax.set_yticklabels(np.arange(1, 11, 1));\n```\nThis results in an image without a gridline and with tick marks in the wrong location. When I add `ax.grid(color='w', linestyle='-', linewidth=2)`, the gridlines are in the wrong location. How can I fix these issues?"

        "content": "To achieve your desired results with `matplotlib`, you need to make a few adjustments to your code for both the tick marks and the gridlines. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve the results:\n\n1. **Remove Tick Marks**: You can hide the tick marks while keeping the labels in place by adjusting the tick parameters.\n\n2. **Add Gridlines**: Use the `grid` function, but ensure they align with the boundaries of the pixels.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Generate random data\ndata = np.reshape(np.random.rand(100), newshape=(10, 10))\n\n# Plot the data\nim = plt.imshow(data, interpolation='none', vmin=0, vmax=1, aspect='equal')\n\n# Get the current axis\nax = plt.gca()\n\n# Set tick positions to be at the center of each pixel\nax.set_xticks(np.arange(0.5, 10.5, 1))\nax.set_yticks(np.arange(0.5, 10.5, 1))\n\n# Set tick labels\nax.set_xticklabels(np.arange(1, 11, 1))\nax.set_yticklabels(np.arange(1, 11, 1))\n\n# Remove the tick marks but keep the labels\nax.tick_params(axis='both', which='both', length=0)\n\n# Add gridlines between the pixel boundaries\nax.grid(color='w', linestyle='-', linewidth=2)\n\n# Set the gridlines to be behind the image\nax.set_axisbelow(True)\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Key Adjustments:\n\n- **Tick Positioning**: By setting the `xticks` and `yticks` to `np.arange(0.5, 10.5, 1)`, you position the ticks between the pixels rather than in the center.\n  \n- **Tick Marks**: Use `ax.tick_params(axis='both', which='both', length=0)` to remove the tick marks while keeping the labels visible.\n\n- **Gridlines**: By setting the gridlines with `ax.grid(color='w', linestyle='-', linewidth=2)` and `ax.set_axisbelow(True)`, you ensure that the gridlines appear between the pixels and behind the image for a clean look.\n\nThis should give you a matrix plot with clear gridlines and labels correctly aligned without tick marks."
