The purpose of this method is to calculate the average of three numbers. However, when I try to use this method, Python raises a TypeError. Here's the code I'm working with:\n\n```python\nclass MyStuff:\n    def average(a, b, c): # Get the average of three numbers\n        result = a + b + c\n        result = result / 3\n        return result\n\n# Now use the function `average` from the `MyStuff` class\nprint(MyStuff.average(9, 18, 27))\n```\n\nThe error I'm getting is:\n\n```python\nFile \"class.py\", line 7, in <module>\n    print(MyStuff.average(9, 18, 27))\nTypeError: unbound method average() must be called with MyStuff instance as first argument (got int instance instead)\n```\n\nCan you help me understand what's going wrong and how I can fix this?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to how instance methods work in Python classes. By default, methods in a class are instance methods, which means they expect the first parameter to be the instance of the class (usually named `self`). However, since you are calling the method directly on the class itself, Python is expecting an instance of `MyStuff` to be passed as the first argument, which is why you're seeing the `TypeError`.\n\nTo fix this, you have a couple of options:\n\n1. **Make it a Static Method**: If you don't need to access any properties of the class instance, you can make the method a static method using the `@staticmethod` decorator. This way, you can call the method directly on the class without needing an instance.\n\n    Here's how you can do it:\n\n    ```python\n    class MyStuff:\n        @staticmethod\n        def average(a, b, c): # Get the average of three numbers\n            result = a + b + c\n            result = result / 3\n            return result\n\n    # Now use the function `average` from the `MyStuff` class\n    print(MyStuff.average(9, 18, 27))\n    ```\n\n2. **Use an Instance Method**: If you want to keep it as an instance method, you need to create an instance of the class and then call the method on that instance.\n\n    Here's how you can do it:\n\n    ```python\n    class MyStuff:\n        def average(self, a, b, c): # Get the average of three numbers\n            result = a + b + c\n            result = result / 3\n            return result\n\n    # Create an instance of the `MyStuff` class\n    stuff = MyStuff()\n\n    # Now use the function `average` on the instance `stuff`\n    print(stuff.average(9, 18, 27))\n    ```\n\nBoth of these approaches will resolve the `TypeError` and allow you to calculate the average of the three numbers as intended."
