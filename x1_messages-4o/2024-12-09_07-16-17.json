However, when I send the user data in JSON format, the data is not being saved and I receive a response error: \"Unsupported media type 'text/plain;charset=UTF-8' in request\". Here is an example of the JSON data I am attempting to send:\n\n```\n{\n    \"username\": \"Test1\",\n    \"email\": \"test1@gmail.com\",\n    \"first_name\": \"Test1\",\n    \"last_name\": \"Test2\",\n    \"password\":\"12121212\"\n}\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"Unsupported media type 'text/plain;charset=UTF-8' in request,\" typically indicates that the server is expecting a different content type than what you're providing. In this case, it seems like the server is expecting JSON data, but it is receiving a different content type. Here's how you can resolve this issue and make sure your Django REST framework API accepts JSON data:\n\n1. **Set the Content-Type Header:**\n   Make sure that when you send your request from Postman, you're setting the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`. This tells the server that your request body is in JSON format.\n\n   In Postman, you can set this header by selecting the \"Headers\" tab and adding a new header with the key `Content-Type` and the value `application/json`.\n\n2. **Ensure JSON Parsing in Django:**\n   Make sure that your Django view or viewset is set up to parse JSON input. If you're using Django REST framework, this is typically handled automatically, but it's good to ensure that your view/viewset is designed to accept JSON.\n\n   For example, if you're using a viewset, you might have something like this:\n\n   ```python\n   from rest_framework import viewsets\n   from .models import CustomUser\n   from .serializers import CustomUserSerializer\n\n   class CustomUserViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):\n       queryset = CustomUser.objects.all()\n       serializer_class = CustomUserSerializer\n   ```\n\n3. **Check Your Serializer:**\n   Ensure that your serializer is correctly set up to handle user creation. If you're adding extra fields like `password`, make sure you handle them appropriately. You might have a serializer like this:\n\n   ```python\n   from rest_framework import serializers\n   from django.contrib.auth.models import User\n\n   class UserSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):\n       password = serializers.CharField(write_only=True)\n\n       class Meta:\n           model = User\n           fields = ['username', 'email', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'password']\n\n       def create(self, validated_data):\n           user = User.objects.create_user(\n               username=validated_data['username'],\n               email=validated_data['email'],\n               first_name=validated_data['first_name'],\n               last_name=validated_data['last_name'],\n               password=validated_data['password']\n           )\n           return user\n   ```\n\n4. **Test the Endpoint:**\n   With everything set up, try sending the request again from Postman. Make sure you're using a POST request, and double-check your endpoint URL to ensure it's correct.\n\nBy following these steps, your Django REST framework setup should be able to accept and process JSON data for creating a new user. If you continue to encounter issues, double-check your Django settings and ensure that middleware and any additional configurations are not interfering with request parsing."
