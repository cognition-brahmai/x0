Here\u2019s a command you can use:\n\n```bash\ndate +%s%3N\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the command:\n\n- `%s` gives you the current time in seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970).\n- `%3N` adds the current milliseconds.\n\nWhen combined, `%s%3N` provides the current time in milliseconds. Make sure your version of the `date` command supports these format specifiers, as this might vary between different Unix-like systems."
