I have this dataframe:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(10,4),columns=list('ABCD'))\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThis prints:\n\n```\n          A         B         C         D\n0  0.351741  0.186022  0.238705  0.081457\n1  0.950817  0.665594  0.671151  0.730102\n2  0.727996  0.442725  0.658816  0.003515\n3  0.155604  0.567044  0.943466  0.666576\n4  0.056922  0.751562  0.135624  0.597252\n5  0.577770  0.995546  0.984923  0.123392\n6  0.121061  0.490894  0.134702  0.358296\n7  0.895856  0.617628  0.722529  0.794110\n8  0.611006  0.328815  0.395859  0.507364\n9  0.616169  0.527488  0.186614  0.278792\n```\n\nI have used a common approach to iterate, but it's only giving me part of the solution. After selecting a row in each iteration, how do I access row elements by their column name? Here is what I am trying to do:\n\n```python\nfor row in df.iterrows():\n    print(row.loc[0,'A'])\n    print(row.A)\n    print(row.index())\n```\n\nTo my understanding, the row is a Pandas Series. But I am unable to index into the Series. Is there a way to use column names while simultaneously iterating over rows in Pandas dataframe?"

        "content": "When you use `df.iterrows()`, you are actually iterating over a generator that yields pairs of (index, Series) for each row. The mistake in your approach is the way you are trying to access the elements of the row. Instead of accessing the row as `row.loc[0, 'A']`, you should directly access it using the Series object returned by `iterrows()`.\n\nHere's how you can iterate over the rows and access the elements by their column names:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(10, 4), columns=list('ABCD'))\n\nfor index, row in df.iterrows():\n    # Accessing elements by column name\n    print(row['A'])  # Access value in column 'A'\n    print(row['B'])  # Access value in column 'B'\n    # You can access other columns similarly\n```\n\nIn this example, `row` is a Pandas Series for each iteration, and you can access each element using the column name as `row['ColumnName']`. This is the correct way to access elements by column name while iterating over rows in a Pandas DataFrame using `iterrows()`."
