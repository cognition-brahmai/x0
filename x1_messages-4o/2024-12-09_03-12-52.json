Here is the code I currently have:\n\n```python\nlong_string = '\nthis is a really\nreally\nreally\nlong\nstring\n'\n```\n\nHowever, it seems that Python is not recognizing this as a valid string due to its multi-line nature. How can I properly declare a multi-line string in Python?"

This allows you to span the string across multiple lines without any issues. Here's how you can modify your code to properly declare a multi-line string:\n\n```python\nlong_string = '''\nthis is a really\nreally\nreally\nlong\nstring\n'''\n\n# Or using double quotes:\n\nlong_string = \"\"\"\nthis is a really\nreally\nreally\nlong\nstring\n\"\"\"\n```\n\nBoth methods will correctly create a multi-line string in Python. You can choose either single or double triple quotes based on your preference or any other constraints you may have with your code."
