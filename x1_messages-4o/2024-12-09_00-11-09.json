        "content": "Analyzing a Prime Minister's leadership capabilities using JavaScript alone involves subjective evaluation rather than objective measurement. JavaScript can be used to create a structured assessment tool, but it requires input data and subjective judgment to evaluate the criteria you've mentioned. Here's a conceptual approach to how you might use JavaScript to facilitate such an analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Define Criteria and Scale\n\nDefine the five-point scale for each criterion:\n\n1. **Communication Proficiency**: Assess clarity, coherence, and effectiveness in conveying messages.\n2. **Ability to Make Informed Decisions**: Evaluate decision-making based on available data and outcomes.\n3. **Effectiveness in Executing Policies**: Measure the implementation success of policies.\n4. **Proficiency in Crisis Management**: Assess handling and resolution of crises.\n5. **Overall Effectiveness in Role**: Evaluate the general performance in fulfilling the responsibilities of the role.\n\n### Step 2: Create a JavaScript-Based Assessment Tool\n\nYou can create a basic web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to collect input from users or experts:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Leadership Assessment Tool</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Prime Minister Leadership Assessment</h1>\n    <form id=\"assessmentForm\">\n        <label for=\"communication\">Communication Proficiency (1-5):</label>\n        <input type=\"number\" id=\"communication\" name=\"communication\" min=\"1\" max=\"5\" required><br><br>\n        \n        <label for=\"decisionMaking\">Decision Making (1-5):</label>\n        <input type=\"number\" id=\"decisionMaking\" name=\"decisionMaking\" min=\"1\" max=\"5\" required><br><br>\n        \n        <label for=\"policyExecution\">Policy Execution (1-5):</label>\n        <input type=\"number\" id=\"policyExecution\" name=\"policyExecution\" min=\"1\" max=\"5\" required><br><br>\n        \n        <label for=\"crisisManagement\">Crisis Management (1-5):</label>\n        <input type=\"number\" id=\"crisisManagement\" name=\"crisisManagement\" min=\"1\" max=\"5\" required><br><br>\n        \n        <label for=\"overallEffectiveness\">Overall Effectiveness (1-5):</label>\n        <input type=\"number\" id=\"overallEffectiveness\" name=\"overallEffectiveness\" min=\"1\" max=\"5\" required><br><br>\n        \n        <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\">\n    </form>\n\n    <p id=\"result\"></p>\n\n    <script>\n        document.getElementById('assessmentForm').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {\n            event.preventDefault();\n            const communication = parseInt(document.getElementById('communication').value);\n            const decisionMaking = parseInt(document.getElementById('decisionMaking').value);\n            const policyExecution = parseInt(document.getElementById('policyExecution').value);\n            const crisisManagement = parseInt(document.getElementById('crisisManagement').value);\n            const overallEffectiveness = parseInt(document.getElementById('overallEffectiveness').value);\n            \n            const totalScore = communication + decisionMaking + policyExecution + crisisManagement + overallEffectiveness;\n            const averageScore = totalScore / 5;\n\n            let assessmentResult = \"Average Score: \" + averageScore.toFixed(2) + \" - \";\n\n            if (averageScore >= 4) {\n                assessmentResult += \"Excellent Leadership\";\n            } else if (averageScore >= 3) {\n                assessmentResult += \"Good Leadership\";\n            } else if (averageScore >= 2) {\n                assessmentResult += \"Average Leadership\";\n            } else {\n                assessmentResult += \"Poor Leadership\";\n            }\n\n            document.getElementById('result').innerText = assessmentResult;\n        });\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Statement\n\nEvaluating a statement like \"The Prime Minister's incompetence is overwhelmingly apparent, and their resignation is warranted\" involves subjective judgment. You can use JavaScript to collect opinions or ratings from multiple users and present an aggregate view. However, this does not provide an objective measurement, as opinions are inherently subjective.\n\nTo implement a simple voting or opinion collection tool:\n\n1. Create a form with radio buttons or a text area for users to express their opinions.\n2. Use JavaScript to tally responses and display results.\n\nRemember, while JavaScript can facilitate data collection and basic analysis, assessing leadership involves subjective interpretation of qualitative data. Incorporating expert opinions and factual evidence is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation."
