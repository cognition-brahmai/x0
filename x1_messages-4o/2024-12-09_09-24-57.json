        "content": "To create a Java program that reverses a string input from the user, you can follow the steps below. This program will prompt the user to enter a string, reverse it, and then print the reversed string.\n\nHere's a simple example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class ReverseString {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Create a Scanner object to read input from the user\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        // Prompt the user to enter a string\n        System.out.print(\"Enter a string to reverse: \");\n        String originalString = scanner.nextLine();\n\n        // Reverse the string\n        String reversedString = new StringBuilder(originalString).reverse().toString();\n\n        // Print the reversed string\n        System.out.println(\"Reversed string: \" + reversedString);\n\n        // Close the scanner\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### How it Works:\n\n1. **Scanner Class**: We use the `Scanner` class to read input from the user. This is a standard way to get user input in Java.\n\n2. **Reading Input**: The `nextLine()` method of the `Scanner` class is used to read a full line of text entered by the user.\n\n3. **StringBuilder**: We use `StringBuilder` to reverse the string. The `StringBuilder` class has a built-in `reverse()` method that reverses the sequence of characters in the builder.\n\n4. **Printing the Result**: Finally, the reversed string is printed to the console.\n\n5. **Close Scanner**: It is a good practice to close the `Scanner` object after its use to free up resources.\n\nYou can compile and run this Java program to see how it works. When you input a string, it will output the reversed version of that string."
