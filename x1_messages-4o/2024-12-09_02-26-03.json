The values in this dictionary are not unique and I would like to group all the keys of unique values as a list and create a new dictionary. The desired output is v = {6:[1], 1:[2, 3, 6], 9: [4, 5]}. I am having trouble with creating this new dictionary where the keys are sorted. How can I accomplish this?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired output where you group the keys by their values in the original dictionary and sort the keys in the new dictionary, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize an empty dictionary to hold the new structure.\n2. Iterate over each key-value pair in the original dictionary.\n3. For each value in the original dictionary, check if it is already a key in the new dictionary. If not, add it and initialize an empty list.\n4. Append the current key to the list of keys for that value in the new dictionary.\n5. Finally, sort the keys of the new dictionary.\n\nHere's the code to accomplish this:\n\n```python\nd = {1: 6, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 9, 5: 9, 6: 1}\n\n# Initialize an empty dictionary to hold the grouped keys\nv = {}\n\n# Iterate over the original dictionary\nfor key, value in d.items():\n    # If the value is not already a key in the new dictionary, add it\n    if value not in v:\n        v[value] = []\n    # Append the current key to the list of keys for this value\n    v[value].append(key)\n\n# Sort the dictionary by keys\nv = dict(sorted(v.items()))\n\nprint(v)\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n\n```\n{1: [2, 3, 6], 6: [1], 9: [4, 5]}\n```\n\nThis result matches your desired output, with the keys sorted in ascending order."
