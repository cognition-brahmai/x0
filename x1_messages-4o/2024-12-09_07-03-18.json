        "content": "To implement parallel programming in your Python program similar to OpenMP in C++, you can use the `concurrent.futures` module, which provides a high-level interface for asynchronously executing callables. Specifically, you can use `ThreadPoolExecutor` or `ProcessPoolExecutor` to run `setinner` and `setouter` in parallel. Here's how you can modify your code to parallelize these two functions:\n\n```python\nimport concurrent.futures\n\ndef solve(Q, G, n):\n    i = 0\n    tol = 10 ** -4\n\n    while i < 1000:\n        with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) as executor:\n            # Submit the tasks to the executor\n            future_inner = executor.submit(setinner, Q, G, n)\n            future_outer = executor.submit(setouter, Q, G, n)\n\n            # Retrieve the results\n            inneropt, partition, x = future_inner.result()\n            outeropt = future_outer.result()\n\n        if (outeropt - inneropt) / (1 + abs(outeropt) + abs(inneropt)) < tol:\n            break\n\n        node1 = partition[0]\n        node2 = partition[1]\n\n        G = updateGraph(G, node1, node2)\n\n        if i == 999:\n            print(\"Maximum iteration reaches\")\n    \n    print(inneropt)\n\n# Example functions\ndef setinner(Q, G, n):\n    # Simulate some computation\n    partition = (1, 2)\n    x = None\n    inneropt = 42  # Dummy value\n    return inneropt, partition, x\n\ndef setouter(Q, G, n):\n    # Simulate some computation\n    outeropt = 84  # Dummy value\n    return outeropt\n\ndef updateGraph(G, node1, node2):\n    # Simulate graph update\n    return G\n\n# Test the solve function\nQ = None\nG = None\nn = 10\nsolve(Q, G, n)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **ThreadPoolExecutor**: This is used here for simplicity. It is suitable for I/O-bound tasks. If your tasks are CPU-bound, consider using `ProcessPoolExecutor` instead to avoid Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).\n- **max_workers=2**: This specifies the number of worker threads to use. Since you have two independent functions to run in parallel, you set it to 2.\n- **`executor.submit()`**: This method schedules the callable to be executed and returns a `Future` object.\n- **`future.result()`**: This method blocks until the callable is complete and returns the result.\n\nIf your functions perform heavy computations, and you want to utilize multiple cores effectively, replace `ThreadPoolExecutor` with `ProcessPoolExecutor`. This uses separate processes instead of threads, which is more suitable for CPU-bound tasks."
