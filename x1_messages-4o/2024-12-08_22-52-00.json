If you randomly choose 2 pieces of fruit from the basket without replacement, what is the probability that their combined weight is less than 400 grams?\nNote: You may assume that the weight of the fruit is evenly distributed within each fruit type (i.e., all apples weigh the same, and all oranges weigh the same)."
