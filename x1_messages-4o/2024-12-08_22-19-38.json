        "content": "The formula for calculating the potential energy of an object based on its mass and height above a reference point is:\n\n\\[ \\text{PE} = mgh \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\text{PE}\\) is the potential energy,\n- \\(m\\) is the mass of the object,\n- \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \\(9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\) on the surface of the Earth),\n- \\(h\\) is the height above a reference point.\n\n### Relation to the Work-Energy Theorem\nThe work-energy theorem states that the net work done on an object is equal to its change in kinetic energy. When considering gravitational potential energy, this theorem can also be applied to express the change in potential energy. Specifically, when an object is lifted to a certain height, work is done against the gravitational force, and this work results in an increase in the object's potential energy. Conversely, when the object falls, the potential energy is converted back into kinetic energy.\n\n### Example Calculation\nTo calculate the potential energy of a 5 kg object lifted to a height of 10 meters:\n\n1. Identify the mass (\\(m\\)), gravitational acceleration (\\(g\\)), and height (\\(h\\)):\n   - \\(m = 5 \\, \\text{kg}\\)\n   - \\(g = 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\)\n   - \\(h = 10 \\, \\text{m}\\)\n\n2. Substitute these values into the potential energy formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{PE} = mgh = (5 \\, \\text{kg})(9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2)(10 \\, \\text{m})\n   \\]\n\n3. Perform the calculation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{PE} = 490 \\, \\text{J}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the potential energy of the object is 490 joules. This energy represents the work done to lift the object to that height, which could be converted back into kinetic energy if the object were allowed to fall back down."
