I have implemented it in the following manner:\n\n```python\nfrom django.core.management import BaseCommand\nimport cProfile\n\nclass Command(BaseCommand):\n    def handle(self, *args, **options):\n        from email.modname import send_email\n        cProfile.run('send_email(user_id=1, city_id=4)')\n```\n\nHowever, when I run this management command, it throws an error stating that the name 'send_email' is not defined. The error trace is as follows:\n\n```python\nexec cmd in globals, locals\nFile \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\nNameError: name 'send_email' is not defined\n```\n\nHow does cProfile evaluate the string (look up function names in the global/local namespace) and what am I missing here?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the way `cProfile.run()` evaluates the string you pass to it. The string is executed as a standalone piece of code, which means it doesn't have access to the local scope where `send_email` is defined. Here's what you can do to fix this issue:\n\n1. **Use `cProfile.Profile`**: Instead of using `cProfile.run()`, you can use `cProfile.Profile` to create a profile object and then call the function directly. This allows you to pass the function and its arguments directly without relying on string evaluation.\n\n2. **Refactor your code**: Adjust your Django management command to use `cProfile.Profile` as shown below:\n\n```python\nfrom django.core.management import BaseCommand\nimport cProfile\nfrom email.modname import send_email\n\nclass Command(BaseCommand):\n    def handle(self, *args, **options):\n        profiler = cProfile.Profile()\n        profiler.enable()\n        \n        # Call the send_email function directly\n        send_email(user_id=1, city_id=4)\n        \n        profiler.disable()\n        profiler.print_stats(sort='time')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **cProfile.Profile()**: This creates a new profiler object.\n- **profiler.enable()** and **profiler.disable()**: These methods start and stop the profiling.\n- **profiler.print_stats()**: This prints the profiling results, which you can sort by various criteria such as execution time.\n\nBy using this approach, you avoid the limitations of string evaluation in `cProfile.run()` and have more control over the profiling process. Additionally, it provides a more transparent and flexible way to handle profiling in Python."
