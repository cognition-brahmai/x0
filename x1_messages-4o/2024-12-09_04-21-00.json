        "content": "To delete rows from a DataFrame called `USERS` based on another DataFrame called `EXCLUDE`, where both DataFrames have a field named `email`, you can use the `pandas` library to perform this operation efficiently. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n1. Use the `pandas` library to perform a set operation that identifies the emails in the `USERS` DataFrame that are not in the `EXCLUDE` DataFrame.\n2. Filter the `USERS` DataFrame to keep only the rows with emails that are not in the `EXCLUDE` DataFrame.\n\nHere's how you can do it in code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrames\n# USERS DataFrame\ndata_users = {\n    'email': ['user1@example.com', 'user2@example.com', 'user3@example.com'],\n    'name': ['User One', 'User Two', 'User Three']\n}\nUSERS = pd.DataFrame(data_users)\n\n# EXCLUDE DataFrame\ndata_exclude = {\n    'email': ['user2@example.com']\n}\nEXCLUDE = pd.DataFrame(data_exclude)\n\n# Identify emails to exclude\nemails_to_exclude = EXCLUDE['email']\n\n# Filter USERS DataFrame to exclude those emails\nUSERS_filtered = USERS[~USERS['email'].isin(emails_to_exclude)]\n\n# Display the result\nprint(USERS_filtered)\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- We first create two DataFrames, `USERS` and `EXCLUDE`.\n- We extract the list of emails to exclude from the `EXCLUDE` DataFrame.\n- We use the `isin()` function combined with the negation operator `~` to filter out rows from the `USERS` DataFrame where the email is contained in the `emails_to_exclude` list.\n- The resulting `USERS_filtered` DataFrame will contain only the rows that do not have an email present in the `EXCLUDE` DataFrame.\n\nThis approach is efficient and leverages pandas' capabilities to work with large datasets."
