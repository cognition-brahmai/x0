        "content": "In Pandas, you can achieve the task of removing rows that are in a list `X` using the `~` operator with the `isin()` function. The `isin()` function checks if each element in the DataFrame or Series is contained in the list `X`, and the `~` operator negates this condition, thus selecting the elements that are not in `X`.\n\nHere's how you can do it in Pandas:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'column_name': ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']\n}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# List of values to remove\nX = ['b', 'd']\n\n# Remove rows where 'column_name' is in list X\ndf_filtered = df[~df['column_name'].isin(X)]\n\nprint(df_filtered)\n```\n\nIn this example, `df_filtered` will contain only the rows where the values in `'column_name'` are not in the list `X`. The `~` operator is used to invert the mask produced by `isin()`, effectively removing the rows where the condition is True (i.e., where the values are in `X`)."
