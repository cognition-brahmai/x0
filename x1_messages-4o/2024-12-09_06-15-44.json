I've installed the command line tools for xcode, and I'm using a brew installed python. However, I keep getting a RuntimeError saying \"Broken toolchain: cannot link a simple C program\" and the command \"python setup.py egg_info\" fails with error code 1. The traceback is over 400 lines, but the main issue seems to be \"clang: error: unknown argument: '-mno-fused-madd' [-Wunused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future]\". How can I resolve this?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to the default behavior of the Clang compiler on OSX 10.9 (Mavericks), which has become stricter in terms of handling certain compiler flags. Specifically, the `-mno-fused-madd` flag is no longer recognized, leading to the error you're seeing.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Update Xcode Command Line Tools**: Ensure your Xcode command line tools are up to date. You can update them using:\n   ```bash\n   xcode-select --install\n   ```\n\n2. **Modify Compiler Flags Temporarily**:\n   You can temporarily adjust compiler behavior by setting the `ARCHFLAGS` environment variable to ignore the problematic flag. Use the following command:\n   ```bash\n   export ARCHFLAGS=\"-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Packages Individually**:\n   Sometimes, installing packages one by one instead of all at once can help isolate issues:\n   ```bash\n   pip install numpy\n   pip install scipy\n   pip install matplotlib\n   ```\n\n4. **Consider Using Pre-built Binaries**:\n   To avoid compilation issues, you can use pre-built binaries for these libraries. Tools like `homebrew` or `conda` provide pre-built versions:\n   - **Homebrew**:\n     ```bash\n     brew install numpy scipy matplotlib\n     ```\n\n   - **Anaconda/Miniconda**: If you use Anaconda or Miniconda, you can create a new environment and install these libraries using:\n     ```bash\n     conda create -n myenv numpy scipy matplotlib\n     conda activate myenv\n     ```\n\n5. **Upgrade pip, setuptools, and wheel**:\n   Sometimes upgrading these tools can help resolve installation issues:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel\n   ```\n\n6. **Check for System Updates**:\n   Make sure your system is up to date. Sometimes, updates to OSX can resolve compatibility issues.\n\n7. **Alternative Python Versions**:\n   If you continue to have issues, consider using a different Python version. Sometimes compatibility issues arise with certain Python versions:\n   ```bash\n   brew install python@3.x\n   ```\n\nFollowing these steps should help you resolve the installation issue you're experiencing with numpy, scipy, and matplotlib on Mac OSX 10.9. If you encounter any further issues, please provide more specific error messages for additional troubleshooting."
