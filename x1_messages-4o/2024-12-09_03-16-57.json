When I use the command `brew install python`, it installs the latest version of Python 3, which currently is version 3.7.0.

        "content": "To install a specific older version of Python using Homebrew, like Python 3.6.5, you can follow these steps. This process involves checking out the Homebrew formula for the specific version you want:\n\n1. **Tap the Homebrew Versions Repository**: This tap was deprecated and is no longer available, so we must use a different approach. We\u2019ll use the commit history of the Homebrew core to find the formula for the specific version.\n\n2. **Find the Commit for Python 3.6.5**:\n   - Visit the Homebrew core repository on GitHub: [Homebrew/homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core).\n   - Navigate to the `Formula` directory and search for the `python.rb` formula.\n   - Use the commit history to find a commit where the formula was for Python 3.6.5.\n   - Copy the commit hash for that specific version.\n\n3. **Checkout the Specific Commit**:\n   Open your terminal and execute the following commands:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd $(brew --repo homebrew/core)\n   git fetch --unshallow\n   git checkout <commit-hash>\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<commit-hash>` with the actual commit hash you found in the previous step.\n\n4. **Install Python 3.6.5**:\n   Once you have checked out the commit, you can install Python 3.6.5 using:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew install python\n   ```\n\n5. **Reset to Latest Homebrew Core**:\n   After you've installed Python 3.6.5, you should reset your Homebrew core to the latest version to avoid any future issues:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd $(brew --repo homebrew/core)\n   git checkout master\n   brew update\n   ```\n\n6. **Verify Installation**:\n   Finally, verify that Python 3.6.5 is installed:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 --version\n   ```\n\nThis method allows you to install an older version of a package using Homebrew by checking out a specific commit in the repository's history."
