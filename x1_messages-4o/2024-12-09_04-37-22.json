        "content": "I am trying to understand how Python's comma operator works during assignment. Looking at the Python documentation on assignment statements, it states that \"if the target is a target list enclosed in parentheses or in square brackets: The object must be an iterable with the same number of items as there are targets in the target list, and its items are assigned, from left to right, to the corresponding targets.\" Based on this, I wrote the following sample code:\n\n```python\na = 5\nb = 4\na, b = a + b, a\nprint a, b\n```\n\nI expected that both 'a' and 'b' would have the value of 9, but instead 'a' has the value of 9 and 'b' has the value of 5. I am having trouble understanding why the older value of 'a' is assigned to 'b' rather than the new one. I thought that according to the documentation, 'a's value would be assigned first. Can anyone help me understand what I'm missing here?"

        "content": "In Python, when you perform a tuple unpacking assignment like `a, b = a + b, a`, the right-hand side is evaluated first before any assignments are made to the left-hand side variables. This is a crucial detail that explains the behavior you're observing.\n\nLet's break down your code:\n\n1. **Initial Values**: `a = 5` and `b = 4`.\n\n2. **Right-Hand Side Evaluation**: When you execute `a, b = a + b, a`, the right-hand side is evaluated first:\n   - `a + b` is evaluated to `5 + 4`, which gives `9`.\n   - `a` is evaluated to `5`.\n\n   So, the right-hand side results in the tuple `(9, 5)`.\n\n3. **Assignment**:\n   - The first element of the tuple `(9, 5)`, which is `9`, is assigned to `a`.\n   - The second element of the tuple, which is `5`, is assigned to `b`.\n\nThus, after the assignment, `a` becomes `9` and `b` becomes `5`.\n\nThis behavior ensures that the assignments do not interfere with each other. The right-hand side is fully evaluated before any variable on the left-hand side is modified. This is why `b` gets the original value of `a`, not the updated one."
