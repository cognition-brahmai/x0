        "content": "To create a function in Python that calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient and its significance between two lists, you can use the `pearsonr` function from the `scipy.stats` module. This function computes the Pearson correlation coefficient and the 2-tailed p-value. Here is a step-by-step guide to creating such a function:\n\n1. Install the required library (if not already installed):\n   You need `scipy` for this. You can install it using pip if you haven't already done so:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install scipy\n   ```\n\n2. Create the function:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.stats import pearsonr\n\ndef calculate_pearson_correlation(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient and its significance between two lists.\n\n    Parameters:\n    list1 (list): First list of numerical values\n    list2 (list): Second list of numerical values\n\n    Returns:\n    tuple: Pearson correlation coefficient and p-value\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(list1) != len(list2):\n        raise ValueError(\"Both lists must have the same number of elements.\")\n\n    correlation_coefficient, p_value = pearsonr(list1, list2)\n    return correlation_coefficient, p_value\n\n# Example usage:\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nlist2 = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n\ncorrelation, significance = calculate_pearson_correlation(list1, list2)\nprint(f\"Pearson Correlation: {correlation}\")\nprint(f\"Significance (p-value): {significance}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Importing `pearsonr`:** This function from `scipy.stats` computes the Pearson correlation coefficient and the two-tailed p-value.\n\n- **Function Definition:** The function `calculate_pearson_correlation` takes two lists as input.\n\n- **Length Check:** Before proceeding, it checks if both lists have the same length, as required for correlation calculation.\n\n- **Calculate Correlation:** It calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient and p-value using `pearsonr`.\n\n- **Return Values:** The function returns a tuple containing the correlation coefficient and the p-value.\n\nThis will give you both the strength of the linear relationship (correlation coefficient) and the statistical significance (p-value) of that relationship between the two lists."
