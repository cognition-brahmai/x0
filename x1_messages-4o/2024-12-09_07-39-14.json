The library should be efficient, support usual string operations such as regex and unicode, and not just simple operations like `''.join(list)`."

        "content": "In Python, strings are immutable, which means you cannot change them in place. However, if you are looking for a mutable string-like object, you can use the `io.StringIO` class from the standard library. Although it is primarily designed for input and output operations, it can be used to perform mutable string operations in a way similar to file operations.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use `io.StringIO`:\n\n```python\nfrom io import StringIO\n\n# Create a mutable string\nmutable_string = StringIO()\n\n# Write to the mutable string\nmutable_string.write(\"Hello\")\nmutable_string.write(\" World\")\n\n# Get the current value of the mutable string\nprint(mutable_string.getvalue())  # Output: Hello World\n\n# Modify the content by overwriting\nmutable_string.seek(0)  # Go back to the beginning\nmutable_string.write(\"Hi\")\n\nprint(mutable_string.getvalue())  # Output: Hi World\n```\n\nHowever, if you need more advanced features like regex and Unicode support that you are accustomed to with Python's native string handling, you might want to consider implementing a custom class that uses a list of characters or a similar approach to allow in-place modifications. Keep in mind that the performance might not match that of native strings due to the overhead of maintaining mutability.\n\nFor a pure Python library specifically designed for mutable strings with efficient operations and Unicode support, there might not be a well-known solution readily available. You might need to use existing libraries like `rope` for text manipulation, which is primarily used for Python refactoring but provides some capabilities for working with mutable text structures.\n\nHere's a simple custom implementation for a mutable string-like object:\n\n```python\nclass MutableString:\n    def __init__(self, initial_string=\"\"):\n        self._chars = list(initial_string)\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return ''.join(self._chars)\n\n    def insert(self, index, substring):\n        self._chars[index:index] = list(substring)\n\n    def remove(self, start, end):\n        del self._chars[start:end]\n\n    def replace(self, old, new):\n        current_str = str(self)\n        replaced_str = current_str.replace(old, new)\n        self._chars = list(replaced_str)\n\n# Example usage\nmutable_str = MutableString(\"Hello\")\nmutable_str.insert(5, \" World\")\nprint(str(mutable_str))  # Output: Hello World\nmutable_str.replace(\"World\", \"Python\")\nprint(str(mutable_str))  # Output: Hello Python\n```\n\nThis custom class would allow you to perform in-place changes while using Python's native string operations for other functionalities like regex."
