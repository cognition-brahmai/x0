I am fairly new to Python, so could you please assist me in solving this problem?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can easily convert the space-delimited string into a list and then randomly select an element using Python. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. Use the `split()` method to convert the string into a list.\n2. Use the `random.choice()` function to select a random element from the list.\n\nHere's the complete code to achieve both tasks:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# Original space-delimited string\nstates = \"Alaska Alabama Arkansas American Samoa Arizona California Colorado\"\n\n# Convert the string into a list using the split() method\nstates_list = states.split()\n\n# Randomly select an element from the list\nrandom_state = random.choice(states_list)\n\n# Output the results\nprint(\"List of States:\", states_list)\nprint(\"Randomly Selected State:\", random_state)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `split()` method: This method splits the string at each space and returns a list of words.\n- `random.choice()`: This function from the `random` module picks a random element from a non-empty sequence.\n\nJust run the above code, and it will convert the string into a list and then print a randomly selected state from that list."
