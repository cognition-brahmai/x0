Here's how the table would look:\n\n| Word        | Frequency |\n|-------------|-----------|\n| Dust        | 20        |\n| Pages       | 300       |\n| Chapters    | 10        |\n| Paragraphs  | 500       |\n| Sentences   | 2000      |\n\nTo calculate the probability of finding the missing word in the sentence \"The book was ___ with dust\", we first need to determine the total frequency of all words combined. Then, we calculate the probability of the word \"dust\" appearing in that context.\n\n1. **Calculate Total Frequency**:  \n   Total Frequency = 20 (dust) + 300 (pages) + 10 (chapters) + 500 (paragraphs) + 2000 (sentences)  \n   Total Frequency = 2830\n\n2. **Calculate Probability of \"dust\"**:  \n   Probability of \"dust\" = Frequency of \"dust\" / Total Frequency  \n   Probability of \"dust\" = 20 / 2830 \u2248 0.0071\n\nThis means there is approximately a 0.71% chance that \"dust\" would be the missing word in the given sentence based on the given word frequencies."
