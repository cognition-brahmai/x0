However, I'm seeing duplicated outputs in both the console and the file despite having disabled propagation and ensuring that no duplicate handlers are present. Here is the configuration I'm using:\n\n```python\ndef setup_logging():\n    loggers = (logging.getLogger(\"amcat\"), logging.getLogger(\"scrapers\"),logging.getLogger(__name__))\n    filename = \"somefile.txt\"\n    sys.stderr = open(filename, 'a')\n    handlers = (logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout),logging.FileHandler(filename))\n    formatter = AmcatFormatter(date = True)\n\n    for handler in handlers:\n        handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)\n        handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\n    for logger in loggers:\n        logger.propagate = False\n        logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)\n        for handler in handlers:        \n            logger.addHandler(handler)\n    logging.getLogger().handlers = []\n```\n\nAnd here's how I'm checking whether things are right:\n\n```python\nshould_work = [\n    \"amcat.scraping.scraper\",\n    \"amcat.scraping.htmltools\",\n    \"amcat.scraping.controller\",\n    \"__main__\"]\n\nloggerdict = logging.Logger.manager.loggerDict #all loggers\nfor name, logger in loggerdict.items():\n    if name in should_work:\n        print(\"\\nlogger: \"+name)\n        #iterate through parents see if effective handlers are set correctly\n        print(effectivehandlers(logger))\n        #test logger\n        logger.info(\"test for {name}\".format(**locals()))\n\ndef effectivehandlers(logger):\n    handlers = logger.handlers\n    while True:\n        logger = logger.parent\n        handlers.extend(logger.handlers)\n        if not (logger.parent and logger.propagate):\n            break\n    return handlers\n```\n\nYet, the output for each logger appears twice. Why is this happening and how can I fix it?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing with duplicated log outputs is often a result of handlers being attached multiple times or loggers inadvertently propagating their log messages. Let's go through your setup and identify potential causes and solutions:\n\n### Key Points to Consider\n\n1. **Propagation**: You have set `logger.propagate = False`, which should prevent log messages from being passed to the parent logger. However, if this is not applied correctly, it might cause duplicate entries.\n\n2. **Handlers**: Ensure that handlers are not being added multiple times across different parts of the code. Each logger should have distinct handlers.\n\n3. **Root Logger Handlers**: You are clearing the root logger handlers with `logging.getLogger().handlers = []`, which is good practice if you're managing handlers manually. However, ensure that this is not affecting your intended setup.\n\n4. **Stderr Redirection**: Redirecting `sys.stderr` to a file might cause unintended behavior if other parts of your application or libraries are writing to `stderr`.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1. **Check Logger Hierarchy**: Ensure that the loggers you are configuring do not have overlapping names that could inherit handlers from a parent logger inadvertently.\n\n2. **Avoid Adding Handlers Multiple Times**: Ensure handlers are not added more than once to each logger. This can be checked by inspecting the handlers of each logger before adding new ones.\n\n3. **Handler Duplication Check**:\n   Before adding a handler, check if it's already present in the logger's handlers:\n\n   ```python\n   for handler in handlers:\n       if handler not in logger.handlers:\n           logger.addHandler(handler)\n   ```\n\n4. **Confirm Propagation Setting**: Double-check that `propagate` is set to `False` for each logger configuration. You can print the state to verify:\n\n   ```python\n   print(f\"Logger {logger.name} propagate: {logger.propagate}\")\n   ```\n\n5. **Logger Configuration**:\n   Make sure your logger configuration is correctly applied before any logging occurs. If loggers are instantiated elsewhere and configured differently, it can lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n6. **Simplify Configuration for Testing**:\n   Try a minimal setup to verify where the duplication arises:\n\n   ```python\n   import logging\n   import sys\n\n   def setup_logging():\n       loggers = (\n           logging.getLogger(\"amcat\"),\n           logging.getLogger(\"scrapers\"),\n           logging.getLogger(__name__)\n       )\n       filename = \"somefile.txt\"\n       handlers = (\n           logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout),\n           logging.FileHandler(filename)\n       )\n       formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n\n       for handler in handlers:\n           handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)\n           handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\n       for logger in loggers:\n           logger.propagate = False\n           logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)\n           for handler in handlers:\n               if handler not in logger.handlers:\n                   logger.addHandler(handler)\n\n   setup_logging()\n\n   logging.getLogger(\"amcat\").info(\"This is a test message from amcat\")\n   logging.getLogger(\"scrapers\").info(\"This is a test message from scrapers\")\n   ```\n\nBy systematically applying these recommendations, you should be able to identify and resolve the duplication issue in your logging configuration."
