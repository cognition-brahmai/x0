        "content": "I am using Pytorch for training neural networks and I am confused about the differentiability of the max() operation. In my code, \"prediction\" is the output tensor of \"myNetwork\" and I want to maximize the largest output of \"prediction\" over a batch, even though we cannot know what index is the largest output for new input data. My training seems to be successful, but I've heard conflicting information regarding whether the max() operation is differentiable or not. Some say it's not mathematically differentiable while others argue that max() is just an identity function to select the largest element, which is differentiable. Can anyone clarify if the max() operation is differentiable in Pytorch? Here is my code for reference:\n\n```\nprediction = myNetwork(img_batch)\nmax_act = prediction.max(1)[0].sum()\nloss = softcrossentropy_loss - alpha * max_act\n```"

        "content": "In PyTorch, the `max()` operation itself is not differentiable in the classical sense because it involves discrete choices (selecting the maximum value), which means it has no well-defined gradient everywhere. However, PyTorch provides automatic differentiation using autograd, which can handle operations like `max()` by propagating gradients through subgradients or by using gradient approximations.\n\nIn your code, `prediction.max(1)[0]` selects the maximum value along the specified dimension (in this case, dimension 1), and this operation is supported by PyTorch's autograd system. The key here is understanding that while the gradient may not be classically defined, PyTorch computes subgradients or uses gradient approximations that allow backpropagation to occur.\n\nThe `max()` operation is treated as having a gradient of 1 for the maximum value and 0 for the non-maximum values. This means that during backpropagation, the gradient will pass through the path of the maximum value, allowing you to optimize your model using this operation.\n\nIn summary, while `max()` is not differentiable in the traditional sense, PyTorch's autograd system can handle it effectively, allowing you to use it in your models for training. Your training can succeed even with this operation, as PyTorch manages the differentiation process behind the scenes."
