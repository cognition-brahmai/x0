When I try to pass the '--compiler-options \"-std=c++0x\"' to nvcc, it throws several errors (from /usr/include/c++/4.5/exception_ptr.h and /usr/include/c++/4.5/nested_exception.h). This happens when I compile my test.cu file which has the following code: \n\n```cpp\n#include <cuda.h>\n\n__host__ void test() {\n  // nothing in method\n}\n```\n\nThis compiles fine with 'nvcc -c -o test.o test.cu', but not with 'nvcc -c -o test.o test.cu --compiler-options \"-std=c++0x\"'. Is it possible to use C++11 with CUDA 4.1 and if so, how can this issue be solved?"

        "content": "CUDA 4.1 is quite an old version, and it was released before C++11 became an official standard, which is likely the root of the issues you are encountering. This version of CUDA does not fully support C++11 features, and the errors you are seeing when trying to use C++11 are due to incompatibilities with the GCC 4.5 standard library headers that expect a more modern compiler.\n\nHere are a few suggestions to work around this issue:\n\n1. **Upgrade Your Toolchain**: The most straightforward solution is to upgrade both your CUDA and GCC versions. Later versions of CUDA have better support for C++11 and beyond. Consider upgrading to at least CUDA 5.5 or later and GCC 4.8 or later, as they have improved support for C++11.\n\n2. **Use a Newer GCC**: If upgrading CUDA is not an option, you might try using a newer version of GCC with your current CUDA installation. However, this might require some additional effort to ensure compatibility between the different versions.\n\n3. **Limit C++11 Usage**: If upgrading is not an option, and you can control the use of C++11 features, try to limit or avoid using C++11 features that are causing the issues. The specific errors you mentioned might be avoided by not using features that rely on exception handling improvements in C++11.\n\n4. **Backporting Features**: As a last resort, you could manually backport the specific C++11 features you need into your codebase, though this is typically not recommended due to maintenance challenges.\n\n5. **Conditional Compilation**: Use conditional compilation to isolate the C++11 specific code, so it does not interfere with the CUDA code. You can then compile the C++11 code separately with a compatible compiler.\n\nUltimately, upgrading your toolchain is the best long-term solution, as it will provide you with better support and performance improvements that come with newer versions of the compilers and CUDA toolkit."
