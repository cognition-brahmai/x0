Here is a basic example of how you might write such a query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT title\nFROM books\nWHERE title LIKE '%cat%';\n```\n\nIn this query:\n- `SELECT title` specifies that you want to retrieve the data in the `title` column.\n- `FROM books` indicates that the data is being retrieved from a table named `books`.\n- `WHERE title LIKE '%cat%'` filters the results to only include titles that contain the substring \"cat\". The `%` wildcard is used before and after \"cat\" to allow for any characters to appear before and after the substring.\n\nMake sure to replace `title` and `books` with the actual column name and table name used in your database schema."
