        "content": "I'm encountering an \"UnboundLocalError: local variable referenced before assignment\" error after an if statement in my Python code. The code is designed to open a file and execute a function, temp_sky, which iterates over the lines in the file. The function checks a condition and if it passes, a variable \"T\" is assigned a value from the data. This function seems to work for the first call but not for the second one. I've tried making \"T\" a global variable but then both function calls return the same value, which isn't what I want. Can you help me understand what's going wrong here? Here's the relevant code and the error message it produces:\n\n```python\ntfile= open(\"/home/path/to/file\",'r') \n\ndef temp_sky(lreq, breq):\n    for line in tfile:\n        data = line.split()\n        if (    abs(float(data[0]) - lreq) <= 0.1 \n            and abs(float(data[1]) - breq) <= 0.1):            \n            T= data[2]\n    return T\nprint temp_sky(60, 60)\nprint temp_sky(10, -10)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```python\n7.37052488\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"tsky.py\", line 25, in <module>\n  print temp_sky(10, -10)\nFile \"tsky.py\", line 22, in temp_sky\n  return T\nUnboundLocalError: local variable 'T' referenced before assignment\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, `UnboundLocalError: local variable 'T' referenced before assignment`, occurs because the variable `T` may not be assigned a value if the condition inside the `if` statement is not met during the iteration over `tfile`. This would happen if the second call to `temp_sky` does not find any line in the file that matches the condition `(abs(float(data[0]) - lreq) <= 0.1 and abs(float(data[1]) - breq) <= 0.1)`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis and a potential fix:\n\n1. **File Iteration**: Once you iterate over `tfile` for the first call, the file pointer reaches the end of the file. Thus, when you call `temp_sky` the second time, the file pointer is already at the end, and there are no more lines to read.\n\n2. **UnboundLocalError**: Since the second call doesn't process any lines (because the file is exhausted), `T` never gets assigned a new value, resulting in the `UnboundLocalError`.\n\n### Solutions:\n\n1. **Rewind the File Pointer**: Reset the file pointer to the beginning of the file before making each call to `temp_sky`.\n\n2. **Initialize `T`**: Assign a default value to `T` before the loop to ensure it's always defined, even if the condition is never met.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\ndef temp_sky(lreq, breq):\n    tfile.seek(0)  # Rewind the file pointer to the start\n    T = None  # Initialize T with a default value, e.g., None\n    for line in tfile:\n        data = line.split()\n        if (    abs(float(data[0]) - lreq) <= 0.1 \n            and abs(float(data[1]) - breq) <= 0.1):            \n            T = data[2]\n            break  # Exit the loop once you find the first match\n    return T\n\n# Open the file once\nwith open(\"/home/path/to/file\", 'r') as tfile:\n    print(temp_sky(60, 60))\n    print(temp_sky(10, -10))\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n- **`tfile.seek(0)`**: This resets the file pointer to the beginning of the file, ensuring the file is read from the start with each function call.\n- **Initialize `T`**: Set `T` to a default value, like `None`, at the start of the function to avoid `UnboundLocalError`.\n- **`break` Statement**: If you only need the first matching line, use `break` to exit the loop once `T` is assigned.\n\nThis should help resolve the error and correctly process both function calls."
