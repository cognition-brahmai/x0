I'm using Memcached as backend to my Django app and the following code seems to work fine with a normal Django query:\n\n```python\ndef get_myobj():\n    cache_key = 'mykey'\n    result = cache.get(cache_key, None)\n    if not result:\n        result = Product.objects.all().filter(draft=False)\n        cache.set(cache_key, result)\n    return result\n```\n\nHowever, it doesn't seem to work when used with Django Rest Framework API calls:\n\n```python\nclass ProductListAPIView(generics.ListAPIView):\n    def get_queryset(self):\n        product_list = Product.objects.all()\n        return product_list\n    serializer_class = ProductSerializer\n```\n\nI'm considering trying DRF-extensions which provide caching functionality, as per this link: https://github.com/chibisov/drf-extensions, but the build status on GitHub is currently saying \"build failing\". My application is very read-heavy on API calls. Is there any other way to cache these calls?"

        "content": "To cache Django Rest Framework (DRF) API calls effectively, especially when you're dealing with a read-heavy application, you can still use Memcached in conjunction with some additional techniques. Here are a few approaches you can consider:\n\n1. **DRF-extensions (Despite Build Status):**\n   While the build status of DRF-extensions might be failing, it could still be worth testing in your environment. It provides several useful features like cache response, cache key construction, and cache invalidation. You can try it locally and see if it meets your needs.\n\n2. **Manual Caching in Views:**\n   You can manually implement caching in your DRF views or viewsets. This involves caching the serialized data rather than the queryset. Here\u2019s an example of how you can do it:\n\n   ```python\n   from rest_framework.response import Response\n   from django.core.cache import cache\n   from rest_framework import status, generics\n\n   class ProductListAPIView(generics.GenericAPIView):\n       serializer_class = ProductSerializer\n\n       def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n           cache_key = 'product_list'\n           cached_data = cache.get(cache_key)\n           if cached_data is not None:\n               return Response(cached_data, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)\n\n           product_list = Product.objects.all()\n           serializer = self.get_serializer(product_list, many=True)\n           cache.set(cache_key, serializer.data, timeout=60*15)  # Cache for 15 minutes\n           return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)\n   ```\n\n3. **Using Django\u2019s Cache Middleware:**\n   If your API endpoints are read-heavy and don't require user-specific or dynamic data, you can utilize Django\u2019s cache middleware to cache the entire view response:\n\n   ```python\n   from django.views.decorators.cache import cache_page\n   from django.utils.decorators import method_decorator\n\n   class ProductListAPIView(generics.ListAPIView):\n       queryset = Product.objects.all()\n       serializer_class = ProductSerializer\n\n       @method_decorator(cache_page(60*15))  # Cache view for 15 minutes\n       def dispatch(self, *args, **kwargs):\n           return super().dispatch(*args, **kwargs)\n   ```\n\n4. **Cache Based on Query Parameters:**\n   If your API accepts query parameters, you'll need to cache based on these parameters to ensure the correct data is cached and retrieved. You can construct a cache key that includes the query parameters.\n\n5. **Considerations for Cache Invalidation:**\n   Remember to invalidate the cache whenever the underlying data changes. You can do this by deleting the cache key in your data update/delete logic or by setting appropriate cache expiration times.\n\n6. **API Gateway or Reverse Proxy Caching:**\n   If applicable, consider using an API Gateway or a reverse proxy like Varnish or NGINX to cache responses at a higher level, which can be very effective for public API endpoints.\n\nBy implementing one or more of these strategies, you can effectively cache DRF API calls, thereby improving the performance of your read-heavy application."
