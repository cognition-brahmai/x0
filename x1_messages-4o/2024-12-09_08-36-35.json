Should I convert the dictionary keys into a set first? Also, my dictionaries can have values which can be a dictionary of dictionaries. For example:\n\n```python\ndictA={'key1':a, 'key2':b, 'key3':{'key11':cc, 'key12':dd}, 'key4':{'key111':{....}}}\ndictB={'key1':a, 'key2:':newb, 'key3':{'key11':cc, 'key12':newdd, 'key13':ee}.......\n```\nIn the above scenario, 'key2' value has to be reset to the new value and 'key13' has to be added inside the dictionary. The key value does not have a fixed format. It can be a simple value, a dictionary, or a dictionary of dictionaries."

        "content": "To find keys present in `dictB` but not in `dictA`, you can indeed use sets for a quick comparison. However, since your dictionaries can have nested dictionaries, you will need a recursive approach to handle all levels of nesting.\n\nHere\u2019s a strategy you can use to compare the dictionaries and identify differences, including nested ones:\n\n1. **Compare Top-Level Keys**: Use set operations to find keys in `dictB` that aren't in `dictA`.\n2. **Recursive Comparison for Nested Dictionaries**: If a key exists in both dictionaries and its value is a dictionary, perform the comparison recursively.\n\nHere's a Python function to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef find_differences(dictA, dictB, path=''):\n    differences = {}\n    \n    # Check keys in dictB not in dictA\n    for key in dictB:\n        new_path = f\"{path}.{key}\" if path else key\n        if key not in dictA:\n            differences[new_path] = {'action': 'add', 'value': dictB[key]}\n        else:\n            # If the value is a dictionary, recurse\n            if isinstance(dictB[key], dict) and isinstance(dictA[key], dict):\n                nested_diff = find_differences(dictA[key], dictB[key], new_path)\n                differences.update(nested_diff)\n            # If values are different, mark for reset\n            elif dictB[key] != dictA[key]:\n                differences[new_path] = {'action': 'reset', 'value': dictB[key]}\n    \n    # Optionally, include keys in dictA not in dictB if you care about removals\n    # for key in dictA:\n    #     if key not in dictB:\n    #         new_path = f\"{path}.{key}\" if path else key\n    #         differences[new_path] = {'action': 'remove'}\n    \n    return differences\n\n# Example usage\ndictA = {'key1': 'a', 'key2': 'b', 'key3': {'key11': 'cc', 'key12': 'dd'}, 'key4': {'key111': {}}}\ndictB = {'key1': 'a', 'key2': 'newb', 'key3': {'key11': 'cc', 'key12': 'newdd', 'key13': 'ee'}}\n\ndifferences = find_differences(dictA, dictB)\nprint(differences)\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- The function `find_differences` recursively traverses both dictionaries.\n- It checks for keys in `dictB` that are not in `dictA` and notes them with an `'add'` action.\n- If a key exists in both but the values differ, it notes a `'reset'` action.\n- If both values are dictionaries, it recursively checks inside them.\n- The function returns a dictionary mapping each differing path to the action needed (`'add'` or `'reset'`) and the new value.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles nested dictionaries and provides a clear mapping of changes needed to make `dictA` reflect `dictB`."
