The ranking is determined by sorting the mean test scores in descending order, with the best (highest) mean test score receiving a rank of 1, the second best a rank of 2, and so on. Essentially, this metric helps you quickly identify which hyperparameter combinations performed best during cross-validation.\n\nIn your specific output, the `rank_test_score` is 1, which indicates that this particular set of hyperparameters (`{'n_neighbors': 1, 'weights': 'distance'}`) achieved the best performance (highest mean test score) among all the hyperparameter combinations that were evaluated by `GridSearchCV`. \n\nThis ranking is particularly useful when you have multiple parameter combinations, as it allows you to easily compare them and select the most effective one."
