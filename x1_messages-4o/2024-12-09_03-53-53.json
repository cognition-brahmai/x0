How can I achieve this?"

Here's a way to reduce those lines of code:\n\n```python\nreplacements = {\n    'A': '1',\n    'B': '2',\n    'C': '3',\n    'D': '4',\n    'E': '5'\n}\n\nfor old, new in replacements.items():\n    my_string = my_string.replace(old, new)\n```\n\nThis approach allows you to easily manage replacements and is more scalable if you need to add or change any replacements in the future."
