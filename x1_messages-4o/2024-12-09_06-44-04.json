More specifically, should I test only the public methods or should the private and protected methods also be included in the tests? If I have a parent class 'Mammal' with one public method 'eat' and two protected methods '_eating_method' and '_consume', should all these methods be tested? Furthermore, if I introduce a child class 'Tiger' that inherits from 'Mammal' and overrides '_eating_method' and '_consume', should I test all four methods of 'Tiger' (including the two inherited methods), or just test the changes introduced (only the overridden two methods)? What is the ideal case?"

        "content": "In unit testing, the primary focus is on testing the public interface of your classes. This is because the public methods are the entry points that are used by other parts of your system or by other systems. Testing private and protected methods directly is generally discouraged for several reasons:\n\n1. **Encapsulation**: Private and protected methods are intended to be internal implementation details. Testing these methods directly can break encapsulation and make your tests more fragile, as they may be more susceptible to changes when the internal implementation evolves.\n\n2. **Refactoring**: If you test internal methods directly, you might find yourself needing to change the tests whenever you refactor your code, even if the public behavior hasn't changed.\n\n3. **Test Maintenance**: Focusing on public methods keeps your test suite maintainable. It ensures that tests are only concerned with the behavior that is visible and relevant to users of the class.\n\n### Testing Strategy for Classes and Subclasses:\n\n1. **Test Public Methods**: Focus on testing the public methods of your classes. Ensure that they behave as expected in all scenarios.\n\n2. **Use Public Methods to Indirectly Test Internal Methods**: When you test a public method, it will often exercise private and protected methods. Ensure your tests cover various scenarios to indirectly test the internal logic.\n\n3. **Parent Class ('Mammal')**:\n   - Test the public method `eat` thoroughly.\n   - Ensure that through `eat`, you are covering different scenarios that might involve `_eating_method` and `_consume`.\n\n4. **Child Class ('Tiger')**:\n   - Again, focus on testing the public methods.\n   - Since `_eating_method` and `_consume` are overridden, ensure that any differences in behavior are captured by testing the public methods that use these overridden methods.\n   - If `Tiger` has its own public methods, test those as well.\n\n### Ideal Approach:\n\n- **Test the Behavior, Not the Implementation**: Concentrate on what the class or method is supposed to do (its behavior) rather than how it does it (its implementation).\n- **Use Mocking and Stubbing if Necessary**: If the internal behavior is complex and affects the public method's output, consider using mocking or stubbing to simulate the internal method behavior during testing.\n- **Consider Integration Tests for Complex Interactions**: If the interaction between methods (including protected and private ones) is complex, an integration test might be more suitable to ensure the components work together as expected.\n\nBy focusing on the public interface and the overall behavior, you keep your tests robust and maintainable, providing confidence that your code works correctly without being tightly coupled to its internal implementation details."
