The letter \"y\" that labels the Y axis is currently displayed on its side, which doesn't make sense for a one-letter label and I would prefer it to be upright. I haven't found a solution in my searches."

        "content": "To display the Y-axis label horizontally in a chart created using the Matplotlib library in Python, you can use the `set_rotation` method for the Y-axis label. By default, the Y-axis label is rotated 90 degrees, but you can change this to 0 degrees to make it horizontal. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Sample data\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ny = [10, 15, 13, 17, 20]\n\n# Create a plot\nplt.plot(x, y)\n\n# Set the Y-axis label with horizontal orientation\nplt.ylabel('y', rotation=0, labelpad=15)\n\n# Optionally, adjust the label padding\n# 'labelpad' adjusts the distance of the label from the Y-axis\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn the code snippet above, `rotation=0` sets the label to be horizontal. You can also use the `labelpad` parameter to adjust the distance between the label and the axis, which helps in making the label more readable, especially after changing its orientation. Adjust `labelpad` as necessary to fit your specific chart layout."
