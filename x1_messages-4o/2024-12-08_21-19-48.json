Your task is to use the Ruby code to create an active voice sentence using these variables. The passive voice sentence is \"#{presentation} was given by the #{researcher}\". Can you figure out the code to convert it to active voice? Don't forget to print both the passive and active voice sentences!"

Here's how you can achieve this using the given variables:\n\n```ruby\n# Define the variables\nresearcher = \"Dr. Smith\"\npresentation = \"Annual Science Report\"\ngiveAction = \"gave\"\n\n# Passive voice sentence\npassive_sentence = \"#{presentation} was given by the #{researcher}.\"\nputs \"Passive voice: \" + passive_sentence\n\n# Active voice sentence\nactive_sentence = \"The #{researcher} #{giveAction} the #{presentation}.\"\nputs \"Active voice: \" + active_sentence\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We define the variables `researcher`, `presentation`, and `giveAction`.\n- We construct the passive voice sentence using string interpolation.\n- We rearrange the structure to form the active voice sentence and use the `giveAction` variable to form the verb in the active sentence.\n- Finally, we print both the passive and active voice sentences."
