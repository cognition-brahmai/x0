Why is the 'utcnow' function not working on my computer?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering stems from trying to access `utcnow()` directly from the `datetime` module, rather than from the `datetime` class within that module. The `utcnow` function is indeed available, but it belongs to the `datetime` class inside the `datetime` module. You need to adjust your code to access it properly. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ncurrent_utc_time = datetime.utcnow()\nprint(current_utc_time)\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, you're importing the `datetime` class from the `datetime` module, and then calling `utcnow()` on that class. This is the correct way to access the `utcnow` function."
