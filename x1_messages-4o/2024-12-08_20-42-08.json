Below is a step-by-step guide along with the necessary code to create a table and format the input data:\n\n### Step 1: Access MySQL Shell\n\nFirst, you need to open your terminal or command prompt and log in to the MySQL server. Use the following command:\n\n```bash\nmysql -u username -p\n```\n\nReplace `username` with your MySQL username. You'll be prompted to enter your password.\n\n### Step 2: Select the Database\n\nOnce you're logged in, select the database where you want to create the table:\n\n```sql\nUSE database_name;\n```\n\nReplace `database_name` with the name of your database.\n\n### Step 3: Create the Table\n\nNow, you can create a table using the `CREATE TABLE` statement. Here's an example of how to create a table named `employees`:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE employees (\n    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n    email VARCHAR(100),\n    hire_date DATE,\n    salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n);\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n\n- `id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY`: This creates a column named `id` which is an integer and automatically increments with each new record. It also serves as the primary key.\n- `first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL`: This creates a column named `first_name` which is a variable character string with a maximum length of 50, and it cannot be NULL.\n- `last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL`: Similar to `first_name`, but for last names.\n- `email VARCHAR(100)`: This creates an optional email field with a maximum of 100 characters.\n- `hire_date DATE`: This specifies a date field for storing the hire date of an employee.\n- `salary DECIMAL(10, 2)`: This specifies a decimal field with up to 10 digits, including 2 digits after the decimal point.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Table Creation\n\nTo verify that the table has been created successfully, you can use the following command to show all tables in the current database:\n\n```sql\nSHOW TABLES;\n```\n\nAnd to see the structure of the `employees` table, use:\n\n```sql\nDESCRIBE employees;\n```\n\n### Step 5: Exit MySQL Shell\n\nOnce you\u2019re done, you can exit the MySQL shell using:\n\n```sql\nEXIT;\n```\n\nThis is a basic example of how to create a table in MySQL using command-line instructions. You can modify the column definitions and data types according to your specific needs."
