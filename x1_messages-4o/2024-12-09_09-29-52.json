        "content": "Certainly! Below is a simple Java game where the user has to guess a random number between 0 and 10. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Random;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class NumberGuessingGame {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Random random = new Random();\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        \n        int randomNumber = random.nextInt(11); // Generates a random number between 0 and 10\n        int userGuess = -1; // Initialize with a number out of range\n\n        System.out.println(\"Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!\");\n        System.out.println(\"I have randomly selected a number between 0 and 10.\");\n        System.out.println(\"Try to guess the number!\");\n\n        while (userGuess != randomNumber) {\n            System.out.print(\"Enter your guess: \");\n            if (scanner.hasNextInt()) {\n                userGuess = scanner.nextInt();\n                \n                if (userGuess < 0 || userGuess > 10) {\n                    System.out.println(\"Please enter a number between 0 and 10.\");\n                } else if (userGuess < randomNumber) {\n                    System.out.println(\"Too low! Try again.\");\n                } else if (userGuess > randomNumber) {\n                    System.out.println(\"Too high! Try again.\");\n                } else {\n                    System.out.println(\"Congratulations! You guessed the correct number: \" + randomNumber);\n                }\n            } else {\n                System.out.println(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number between 0 and 10.\");\n                scanner.next(); // Clear invalid input\n            }\n        }\n        \n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### How to Run the Game:\n1. **Compile the Program**: Save the code in a file named `NumberGuessingGame.java`. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the file, and compile it using:\n   ```\n   javac NumberGuessingGame.java\n   ```\n\n2. **Run the Compiled Program**: After successful compilation, run the program using:\n   ```\n   java NumberGuessingGame\n   ```\n\n3. **Play the Game**: Follow the on-screen instructions to guess the number. The program will provide feedback after each guess until you correctly guess the number.\n\nEnjoy playing the game!"
