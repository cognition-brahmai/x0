However, I'm getting a SyntaxError when I try to use the print function with the keyword argument `end=' '`. The problematic code is as follows:\n```python\nif Verbose:\n    print(\"Building internam Index for %d tile(s) ...\" % len(inputTiles), end=' ')\n```\nI'm new to Python, so I'm not sure why this is happening or what the original author intended. I suspect the issue might be related to these imports failing, but I'm not sure how to fix it:\n```python\ntry: \n   from osgeo import gdal\n   from osgeo import ogr\n   from osgeo import osr\n   from osgeo.gdalconst import *\nexcept:\n   import gdal\n   import ogr\n   import osr\n   from gdalconst import *\n```\nCould someone explain what's going wrong and how I can resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with the `print` function is likely due to the version of Python you're using. The `end` keyword argument for the `print` function was introduced in Python 3. If you are running your script with Python 2, this would cause a `SyntaxError`, as the `print` statement in Python 2 does not support the `end` argument.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Use Python 3:** The simplest solution would be to run your script using Python 3, as it supports the `end` argument in the `print` function. You can check your Python version by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal. If you have Python 3 installed, use `python3` to run your script:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 your_script.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Modify the Code for Python 2 Compatibility:** If you're required to run the script with Python 2, you'll need to modify the `print` statement to be compatible with Python 2. Specifically, you can remove the `end=' '` argument or achieve a similar effect using a comma at the end of the `print` statement:\n\n   ```python\n   if Verbose:\n       print(\"Building internal Index for %d tile(s) ...\" % len(inputTiles)),\n   ```\n\n   This modification uses a trailing comma to suppress the newline character at the end of the `print` statement in Python 2.\n\nRegarding the imports, the code you've provided is set up to handle both the case where the `osgeo` package is installed and the case where it's not (falling back to the imports without the `osgeo` prefix). Ensure that the `osgeo` package is installed in your environment. You can install it using:\n\n```bash\npip install gdal\n```\n\nOr, if you're using a specific package manager like Anaconda, you might need to use:\n\n```bash\nconda install -c conda-forge gdal\n```\n\nEnsure the GDAL library is correctly installed and accessible in your Python environment to avoid import errors."
