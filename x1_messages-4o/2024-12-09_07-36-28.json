For example, just like `numpy.array([1,2,3,4,5]) < 5` returns `array([True, True, True, True, False])`, is it possible to use a similar syntax for checking if elements lie between two numbers, like `1 < numpy.array([1,2,3,4,5]) < 5` to obtain `array([False, True, True, True, False])`? I'm aware that this can be obtained through logical chaining of boolean tests, but I'm looking for a more syntactically clean solution."

        "content": "In Python, you can't directly use chained comparisons with NumPy arrays like you would with scalar values. However, NumPy provides a clean way to achieve the desired result using logical operations. You can use the `numpy.logical_and` function to achieve the \"between\" check in a syntactically clean manner. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\narr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nresult = np.logical_and(arr > 1, arr < 5)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n\n```\narray([False,  True,  True,  True, False])\n```\n\nIn this example, `np.logical_and(arr > 1, arr < 5)` checks if each element in the array is greater than 1 and less than 5, producing a boolean array with `True` where both conditions are satisfied and `False` otherwise. This approach maintains clarity and simplicity while effectively achieving the desired result."
