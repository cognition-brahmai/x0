I have a class named MyClass and a unit test that is supposed to make sure the incorrect argument passed to the constructor properly raises an error. However, I am encountering a 'NameError: global name 'Error' is not defined' issue. I am not sure why this is happening. Isn't 'Error' a built-in default exception type in Python? Where should I be defining this Error object? Here is my code:\n\n    class MyClass:\n        def __init__(self, foo):\n            if foo != 1:\n                raise Error(\"foo is not equal to 1!\")\n\n    def testInsufficientArgs(self):\n        foo = 0\n        self.assertRaises((Error), myClass = MyClass(Error, foo))"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that `Error` is not a built-in exception class in Python. Instead, you should use one of the built-in exception classes such as `ValueError`, `TypeError`, or define a custom exception class if none of the built-in ones are appropriate for your use case.\n\nHere's how you can fix the code:\n\n1. Use a built-in exception class like `ValueError`:\n\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n    def __init__(self, foo):\n        if foo != 1:\n            raise ValueError(\"foo is not equal to 1!\")\n\ndef testInsufficientArgs(self):\n    foo = 0\n    self.assertRaises(ValueError, MyClass, foo)\n```\n\n2. Alternatively, define a custom exception class:\n\n```python\nclass MyError(Exception):\n    pass\n\nclass MyClass:\n    def __init__(self, foo):\n        if foo != 1:\n            raise MyError(\"foo is not equal to 1!\")\n\ndef testInsufficientArgs(self):\n    foo = 0\n    self.assertRaises(MyError, MyClass, foo)\n```\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of what was fixed:\n\n- **Exception Type**: `Error` is undefined. You can replace it with `ValueError` or a custom exception class.\n- **`assertRaises` Usage**: When using `assertRaises()`, you pass the exception type, followed by the callable and its arguments, instead of passing the exception type within a tuple or calling the function directly.\n\nMake sure your unit test class inherits from `unittest.TestCase`, and you execute the test using a test runner like `unittest.main()` if you're running the tests as part of a script."
