I want to create an additional \"totals\" row which leaves most of the columns blank, except for the numerical column, which should be the total for all of the objects. I'm currently using Django 1.2. Is there an easy way to accomplish this within the admin module, or should I create a custom view for it?"

        "content": "To add a totals row in the Django admin list view, especially in Django 1.2, you can extend the capabilities of the admin by customizing the change list view. Unfortunately, Django 1.2 is quite outdated, and some of the features available in later versions might not be directly applicable. However, you can achieve your goal through a workaround by overriding the `changelist_view` method.\n\nHere's a general approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Override the ChangeList**: You need to create a custom ChangeList class that will compute the totals.\n\n2. **Override the changelist_view**: In your model admin, override this method to use your custom ChangeList.\n\n3. **Add the Totals Row**: You can append a totals row within the `result_list` of the ChangeList.\n\nHere's a simplified example of how you might implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom django.contrib.admin.views.main import ChangeList\nfrom django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _\nfrom django.db.models import Sum\n\nclass TotalsChangeList(ChangeList):\n    def get_results(self, request):\n        super(TotalsChangeList, self).get_results(request)\n\n        # Calculate totals for a specific numerical field across all objects.\n        queryset = self.queryset.aggregate(total=Sum('your_numerical_field'))\n        total = queryset.get('total') or 0\n\n        # Append the totals row to the result_list\n        totals_row = {\n            'your_numerical_field': total,\n            'action_checkbox': '',  # Leave other fields blank\n            # Add other fields as necessary, leave them blank\n        }\n        \n        self.result_list = list(self.result_list) + [totals_row]\n\nclass YourModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    list_display = ('field1', 'field2', 'your_numerical_field', 'field3')\n\n    def get_changelist(self, request, **kwargs):\n        return TotalsChangeList\n\n    def changelist_view(self, request, extra_context=None):\n        extra_context = extra_context or {}\n        return super(YourModelAdmin, self).changelist_view(request, extra_context=extra_context)\n\n# Register your model and admin class\nadmin.site.register(YourModel, YourModelAdmin)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **TotalsChangeList**: This is a custom ChangeList class that modifies the `result_list` to include a row for totals. It calculates the total sum of your numerical field and appends a dictionary representing the totals row to the `result_list`.\n\n- **get_changelist** and **changelist_view**: In your `YourModelAdmin` class, override the `get_changelist` method to return your custom ChangeList class, and use the `changelist_view` method to handle additional context if needed.\n\nThis should give you a totals row in the Django admin interface. Please note that since you're using Django 1.2, some methods or properties might need slight adjustments based on your specific setup."
