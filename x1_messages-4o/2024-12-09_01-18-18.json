When I run my code, it throws a WindowsError: [Error 123] mentioning that the filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect. Here is the code that I am using:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nfolders = [\"pdcom1\", \"pdcom1reg\", \"pdcomopen\"]\n\nfor folder in folders:\n    path = r'\"C:\\\\Apps\\\\CorVu\\\\DATA\\\\Reports\\\\AlliD\\\\Monthly Commission Reports\\\\Output\\\\pdcom1\"'\n    for file in os.listdir(path):\n        print file\n```\nI am not sure where the issue lies. Can you help me spot the problem and how to fix it?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the way the `path` variable is defined. The raw string literal `r\"...\"` is used to handle backslashes in the path, which is correct, but you've also included extra quotation marks within the string. This is causing the path to be incorrect. Here's how you can fix it:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nfolders = [\"pdcom1\", \"pdcom1reg\", \"pdcomopen\"]\n\nfor folder in folders:\n    # Corrected path by removing the extra quotes inside the raw string\n    path = r\"C:\\Apps\\CorVu\\DATA\\Reports\\AlliD\\Monthly Commission Reports\\Output\\{}\".format(folder)\n    try:\n        for file in os.listdir(path):\n            print(file)\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"Directory not found: {path}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n```\n\nChanges made:\n1. Removed the extra quotation marks inside the `path` string.\n2. Used the `format` method to dynamically generate the path for each folder.\n3. Added error handling to catch if a directory is not found and to handle other potential exceptions gracefully.\n\nThis should resolve the `WindowsError: [Error 123]` and allow your code to list files in the specified directories."
