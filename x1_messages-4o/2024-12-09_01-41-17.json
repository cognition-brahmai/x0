        "content": "I am using the pandas library to read CSV data. In my data, specific columns contain strings where the string \"nan\" is a possible value, and so is an empty string. I have managed to get pandas to read \"nan\" as a string, but I am struggling to make it read an empty value as an empty string instead of NaN. Is there a way to tell pandas to read an empty cell in a particular CSV column as an empty string instead of NaN? Here is my sample data and output:\n\n```python\nOne,Two,Three\na,1,one\nb,2,two\n,3,three\nd,4,nan\ne,5,five\nnan,6,\ng,7,seven\n\n>>> pandas.read_csv('test.csv', na_values={'One': [], \"Three\": []})\n    One  Two  Three\n0    a    1    one\n1    b    2    two\n2  NaN    3  three\n3    d    4    nan\n4    e    5   five\n5  nan    6    NaN\n6    g    7  seven\n```\n\nI have tried passing in `str` in the `converters` argument to `read_csv` (with `converters={'One': str}`), but it still reads the empty cells as NaN. I know I can fill the values after reading, with `fillna`, but is there a way to do this directly while reading the CSV data?"

        "content": "To ensure that empty cells in specific columns are read as empty strings instead of NaN when using `pandas.read_csv`, you can use the `dtype` parameter combined with the `keep_default_na` and `na_values` parameters. The `dtype` parameter allows you to specify the data type for specific columns, and setting it to `str` will help ensure that empty cells are read as empty strings. Additionally, setting `keep_default_na=False` will prevent pandas from treating empty strings as NaN by default.\n\nHere's how you can modify your `read_csv` call:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read the CSV while specifying data types and handling empty strings\ndf = pd.read_csv(\n    'test.csv',\n    dtype={'One': str, 'Three': str},  # Specify columns to be read as strings\n    keep_default_na=False,             # Prevent default NaN detection\n    na_values={'One': ['nan'], 'Three': ['nan']}  # Define 'nan' as the only NaN value\n)\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nWith this setup:\n- The `dtype` parameter ensures that the specified columns ('One' and 'Three') are treated as strings.\n- The `keep_default_na=False` ensures that pandas does not automatically convert empty strings to NaN.\n- The `na_values` dictionary is used to specify what should be considered as NaN for these columns, which in your case is only the string 'nan'.\n\nThis approach should result in the empty cells in the specified columns being read as empty strings."
