I have a simple fixture set up as follows:\n\n```python\n@pytest.fixture\ndef my_thing(request, db):\n    thing = MyModel.objects.create()\n    request.addfinalizer(lambda: thing.delete())\n    return thing\n```\n\nThis works fine when my tests need a single instance of MyModel. However, I am unsure of how to proceed when I need two or more distinct instances of MyModel, each set up the same way. I tried creating additional fixtures like this:\n\n```python\n@pytest.fixture\ndef my_thing_1(my_thing):\n    return my_thing\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef my_thing_2(my_thing):\n    return my_thing\n```\n\nBut it seems like these new fixtures are returning the same instance of MyModel. Is there a way to achieve what I want using pytest's built-in functionality? Or should I move the setup/teardown of my fixture out into helper functions to avoid duplicating code? Am I approaching this problem incorrectly?"

        "content": "To create multiple distinct instances of a fixture in pytest, you can leverage the `@pytest.fixture` decorator's `params` argument to create parameterized fixtures. This approach allows you to generate multiple instances of a fixture without duplicating code. Here's how you can modify your `my_thing` fixture to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport pytest\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef my_thing(request, db):\n    thing = MyModel.objects.create()\n    request.addfinalizer(lambda: thing.delete())\n    return thing\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef multiple_my_things(request, db):\n    def create_thing():\n        thing = MyModel.objects.create()\n        request.addfinalizer(lambda: thing.delete())\n        return thing\n\n    # Create as many instances as needed\n    return [create_thing() for _ in range(request.param)]\n\n# Then, in your test, you can use this fixture as follows:\n\n@pytest.mark.parametrize('multiple_my_things', [2], indirect=True)\ndef test_multiple_things(multiple_my_things):\n    assert len(multiple_my_things) == 2\n    assert multiple_my_things[0] != multiple_my_things[1]\n    # Add your test logic here\n```\n\nIn this setup:\n\n- The `multiple_my_things` fixture creates a list of `MyModel` instances based on the `request.param` value.\n- The `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator is used to specify how many instances you need for each test. In this example, `2` instances are requested.\n- The `indirect=True` option in `@pytest.mark.parametrize` tells pytest to pass the parameter value to the fixture rather than directly to the test function.\n\nThis approach allows you to flexibly request any number of instances you need for your tests without duplicating the fixture creation logic."
