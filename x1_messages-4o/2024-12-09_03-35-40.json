        "content": "In my Neural Networks model, I have used 5000 samples for training data which were normalized using the formula `y' = (y - mean(y)) / stdev(y)`. After getting the predicted output, I want to de-normalize the data. For this, I have used the formula `y = y' * stdev(y) + mean(y)`. This approach has been taken from a thread on how to de-normalise (de-standardise) neural net predictions after normalising input data. My question is, how can the same mean and standard deviation used in normalizing the training data (5000*2100) be used in de-normalizing the predicted data when the test data (2000*2100) used for prediction has a different count?"

        "content": "When normalizing your training data, you calculate the mean and standard deviation based on the training dataset only. These statistics are then used to standardize both the training and test datasets. This ensures consistency in the transformation process.\n\nWhen you de-normalize your predictions, you should still use the same mean and standard deviation values that were calculated from the training data. This is because the model was trained with data that was normalized using these specific values, and using them for de-normalization maintains the same reference point.\n\nHere's why this approach is valid:\n\n1. **Consistency**: By using the same mean and standard deviation, your model's predictions remain consistent with the scale and distribution of the original training data.\n\n2. **Generalization**: The model learned patterns based on the training data's distribution. Applying the same normalization parameters to the test data allows the model to generalize its predictions appropriately.\n\n3. **Standard Practice**: It's a common practice in machine learning to use training data statistics for normalizing both training and test datasets. This ensures that the model's understanding of the data remains uniform.\n\nIn summary, even though the test data has a different sample count, using the training data's mean and standard deviation for both normalization and de-normalization processes is the correct approach. This ensures that the model's predictions are accurately scaled back to the original units of measurement."
