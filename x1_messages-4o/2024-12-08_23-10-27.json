        "content": "Certainly! Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable \\( y \\) and one or more independent variables \\( x \\). The main idea is to find the linear equation that best predicts the dependent variable as a function of the independent variables.\n\nThe simplest form of linear regression is simple linear regression, where there is only one independent variable. The model can be expressed using the equation:\n\n\\[\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\epsilon\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( y \\) is the dependent variable.\n- \\( x \\) is the independent variable.\n- \\( \\beta_0 \\) is the y-intercept of the regression line (the value of \\( y \\) when \\( x = 0 \\)).\n- \\( \\beta_1 \\) is the slope of the regression line (the change in \\( y \\) for a one-unit change in \\( x \\)).\n- \\( \\epsilon \\) is the error term, representing the difference between the observed and predicted values of \\( y \\).\n\nIn matrix form, especially when dealing with multiple linear regression with multiple independent variables, the model can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) is the vector of observed values of the dependent variable.\n- \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is the matrix of observed values of the independent variables, including a column of ones for the intercept.\n- \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) is the vector of coefficients (including the intercept and slopes).\n- \\(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\) is the vector of error terms.\n\nThe goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting line by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the model. This criterion is known as the \"least squares\" method, and it can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\min_{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 = \\min_{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i))^2\n\\]\n\nIn the matrix form, the least squares solution to finding the optimal coefficients \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{y}\n\\]\n\nThis equation provides the estimated coefficients that minimize the squared differences and thus define the best-fitting line through the data points."
