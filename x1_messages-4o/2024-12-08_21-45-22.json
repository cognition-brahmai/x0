The code must incorporate variable representations of both masses and require a multi-step reasoning process to reach the solution. Prove your mathematical prowess by tackling this complex puzzle. Best of luck in your endeavors!"

        "content": "Certainly! Here's a MATLAB code that uses the symbolic math toolbox to determine the ratio of the mass of Earth to Mars. This code involves defining the masses as symbolic variables and then calculating their ratio using symbolic operations.\n\n```matlab\n% MATLAB Code to calculate the ratio of the mass of Earth to Mars\n\n% Include symbolic math toolbox\nsyms mass_earth mass_mars\n\n% Define the masses of Earth and Mars in kilograms\nmass_earth = sym('5.972e24');  % Mass of Earth in kg\nmass_mars = sym('6.39e23');    % Mass of Mars in kg\n\n% Calculate the ratio of the mass of Earth to Mars\nmass_ratio = mass_earth / mass_mars;\n\n% Display the result\nfprintf('The ratio of the mass of Earth to Mars is: %s\\n', char(mass_ratio));\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Symbolic Variables**: We define `mass_earth` and `mass_mars` as symbolic variables. This allows us to perform precise mathematical operations without rounding errors.\n\n2. **Assign Mass Values**: The masses of Earth and Mars are assigned using scientific notation. This notation is particularly useful for handling very large numbers.\n\n3. **Calculate Ratio**: The ratio of the mass of Earth to Mars is calculated by dividing the symbolic variable for Earth's mass by that of Mars.\n\n4. **Display Result**: The result is converted to a string using `char()` for easy reading when displayed.\n\nThis code efficiently uses the symbolic math toolbox to handle large numbers and perform an exact calculation of the mass ratio."
