It is highly recommended that you instead just switch your application to Unicode strings.\n```\nIf I use 'text' instead of 'blob' and don't compress the HTML snippet, everything works fine, but the database is too large. When I use 'blob' and compress with the Python zlib library, I get the error message above. I've searched but can't seem to find a simple solution, can you help?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that SQLite expects the data being inserted into a BLOB column to be in a format that it can interpret correctly. When you compress data with `zlib`, it returns a byte string, which SQLite needs to handle properly. The issue arises because SQLite's default text factory may not be set up to handle these byte strings correctly.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to handle this situation:\n\n1. **Ensure the Data is in Bytes**: Make sure that the data you're passing to `zlib.compress` is in bytes format. If `html` is a string, you should encode it to bytes using UTF-8 encoding before compressing it.\n\n2. **Set the Text Factory**: Set the `text_factory` of your SQLite connection to `bytes`, which allows the handling of 8-bit byte strings.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\nimport zlib\n\n# Sample HTML content\nhtml = \"<html><body>Hello, World!</body></html>\"\n\n# Encode the HTML to UTF-8 bytes\nhtml_bytes = html.encode('utf-8')\n\n# Compress the bytes\ncompressed_html = zlib.compress(html_bytes)\n\n# Connect to the SQLite database\nconnection = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')\n\n# Set the text factory to handle bytes\nconnection.text_factory = bytes\n\n# Create a cursor object\nc = connection.cursor()\n\n# Create table\nc.execute('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS blah (cid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, html BLOB)')\n\n# Insert compressed data\ncid = 1  # Example cid\nc.execute('INSERT OR IGNORE INTO blah (cid, html) VALUES (?, ?)', (cid, compressed_html))\n\n# Commit the transaction\nconnection.commit()\n\n# Close the connection\nconnection.close()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Encoding**: Convert the string `html` to bytes using `html.encode('utf-8')` before compressing it.\n- **Text Factory**: Setting `connection.text_factory = bytes` allows SQLite to correctly interpret the compressed byte strings.\n- **Error Handling**: Always ensure to handle potential exceptions that can arise from database operations.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to store compressed HTML content in an SQLite database without encountering the `ProgrammingError`."
