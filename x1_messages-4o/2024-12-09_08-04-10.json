I have already installed Python 3.9 using the deadsnakes PPA, but I am unable to uninstall Python 3.8 which is the default version on Ubuntu 20.04. Attempts to install pip with \"sudo apt-get install python3-pip\" install it for Python 3.8 and not Python 3.9. When I try to install pip using \"python3.9 get-pip.py\", I get a ModuleNotFoundError for 'distutils.util'. How can I resolve this?"

        "content": "To install `pip` for Python 3.9 on Ubuntu 20.04, especially when you've installed Python 3.9 using the deadsnakes PPA, you can follow these steps to resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError` for `distutils.util` and successfully set up `pip`:\n\n1. **Ensure Python 3.9 is Installed:**\n   Make sure Python 3.9 is correctly installed. You can verify this by running:\n   ```bash\n   python3.9 --version\n   ```\n\n2. **Install `python3.9-distutils`:**\n   The error you're encountering is due to the absence of `distutils` for Python 3.9. Install it using the following command:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install python3.9-distutils\n   ```\n\n3. **Download `get-pip.py`:**\n   Download the `get-pip.py` script which will help in installing `pip`:\n   ```bash\n   curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py\n   ```\n\n4. **Install `pip` for Python 3.9:**\n   Use Python 3.9 to run the `get-pip.py` script:\n   ```bash\n   python3.9 get-pip.py\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify `pip` Installation:**\n   After installation, verify that `pip` is installed for Python 3.9:\n   ```bash\n   python3.9 -m pip --version\n   ```\n\n6. **Use the Correct `pip`:**\n   To ensure you are using the `pip` associated with Python 3.9, you can explicitly use:\n   ```bash\n   python3.9 -m pip install <package_name>\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to install `pip` specifically for Python 3.9 on your Ubuntu 20.04 system. If you encounter any further issues, ensure that all dependencies and required packages for Python 3.9 are installed from the deadsnakes PPA."
