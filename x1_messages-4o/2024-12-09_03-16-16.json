The code I have written is as follows:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\nimport os, glob\n\npath = '/home/my/path'\nfor infile in glob.glob( os.path.join(path, '*.png') ):\n    print infile\n```\n\nWhen I run this code, the output I get is not ordered by filename or size. Here's the output:\n\n```\n/home/my/path/output0352.png\n/home/my/path/output0005.png\n/home/my/path/output0137.png\n/home/my/path/output0202.png\n/home/my/path/output0023.png\n/home/my/path/output0048.png\n/home/my/path/output0069.png\n/home/my/path/output0246.png\n/home/my/path/output0071.png\n/home/my/path/output0402.png\n/home/my/path/output0230.png\n/home/my/path/output0182.png\n/home/my/path/output0121.png\n/home/my/path/output0104.png\n/home/my/path/output0219.png\n/home/my/path/output0226.png\n/home/my/path/output0215.png\n/home/my/path/output0266.png\n/home/my/path/output0347.png\n/home/my/path/output0295.png\n/home/my/path/output0131.png\n/home/my/path/output0208.png\n/home/my/path/output0194.png\n```\n\nI am not interested in ordering the output, rather I want to understand the default ordering by `glob.glob()`. How are the return values of `glob.glob()` ordered by default?"

        "content": "The `glob.glob()` function in Python does not guarantee any specific order for the files it returns. The order of the results is typically based on the order in which the file system provides them. This means that the files are listed in the order they are found in the directory, which is dependent on the underlying file system and how files are stored within it. Different file systems may return files in different orders, such as the order of creation, modification, or even in a seemingly random order.\n\nIf you need the files to be in a specific order, such as lexicographical order by filename, you can explicitly sort the list of files returned by `glob.glob()` using Python's built-in `sorted()` function:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport glob\n\npath = '/home/my/path'\nfiles = glob.glob(os.path.join(path, '*.png'))\nsorted_files = sorted(files)\n\nfor infile in sorted_files:\n    print(infile)\n```\n\nBy using `sorted()`, you can ensure that the files are processed in a predictable and consistent order, regardless of the file system's default ordering."
