        "content": "To convert a decimal number into a fraction in its simplest form using Python, you can use the `fractions` module, which provides a convenient way to handle rational numbers. Here's a step-by-step guide with examples:\n\n1. Import the `Fraction` class from the `fractions` module.\n2. Use the `Fraction` class to convert the decimal number to a fraction.\n3. The `Fraction` class automatically reduces the fraction to its simplest form.\n\nHere's a sample code:\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Function to convert decimal to fraction\ndef decimal_to_fraction(decimal_number):\n    # Convert decimal to fraction\n    fraction = Fraction(decimal_number).limit_denominator()\n    return fraction\n\n# Examples\ndecimals = [0.25, 0.5, 1.25, 3]\n\nfor decimal in decimals:\n    fraction = decimal_to_fraction(decimal)\n    print(f\"The decimal {decimal} as a fraction is: {fraction}\")\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `Fraction(decimal_number)` creates a fraction from the decimal number.\n- `limit_denominator()` is used to ensure the fraction is in its simplest form by limiting the denominator, though in this case, it's not necessary as `Fraction` automatically reduces it.\n\nWhen you run the above code, it will output:\n\n```\nThe decimal 0.25 as a fraction is: 1/4\nThe decimal 0.5 as a fraction is: 1/2\nThe decimal 1.25 as a fraction is: 5/4\nThe decimal 3 as a fraction is: 3/1\n```\n\nThis way, you can convert any decimal to its simplest fractional form using Python."
