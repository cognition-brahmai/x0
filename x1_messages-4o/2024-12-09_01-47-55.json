Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Download Geckodriver**:\n   - Go to the [Geckodriver releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases).\n   - Download the appropriate version of `geckodriver` for your Linux system. Make sure to select the correct version based on your system architecture (e.g., 32-bit or 64-bit).\n\n2. **Extract the Geckodriver**:\n   - Extract the downloaded tar.gz file using the command:\n     ```bash\n     tar -xvzf geckodriver-vX.XX.X-linux64.tar.gz\n     ```\n   - This will extract the `geckodriver` binary.\n\n3. **Move Geckodriver to a Directory in PATH**:\n   - Move the extracted `geckodriver` to a directory that is included in your system's `PATH`. Common directories include `/usr/local/bin` or `/usr/bin`.\n   - Use a command like the following to move it:\n     ```bash\n     sudo mv geckodriver /usr/local/bin/\n     ```\n   - Ensure that the directory has the correct permissions so that your user can execute the file.\n\n4. **Verify Installation**:\n   - To ensure that `geckodriver` is correctly installed and accessible, run:\n     ```bash\n     geckodriver --version\n     ```\n   - This command should output the version of `geckodriver` if it's properly installed.\n\n5. **Update Your Selenium Script**:\n   - Now your script should be able to find `geckodriver` without any additional configuration.\n   - However, if you want to specify the path manually or if it's installed in a non-standard location, you can specify the path in your script like this:\n     ```python\n     from selenium import webdriver\n     from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys\n\n     driver = webdriver.Firefox(executable_path='/path/to/geckodriver')\n     driver.get(\"https://www.example.com\")\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `FileNotFoundError` and successfully run your Selenium script with Firefox on your Linux machine. If you encounter further issues, ensure that Firefox is installed on your system and is up to date."
