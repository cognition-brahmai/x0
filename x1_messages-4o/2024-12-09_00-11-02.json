        "content": "The noble gas element used in neon lighting that has a boiling point above 0\u00b0C is Krypton. Krypton's boiling point is approximately -153.4\u00b0C, so it remains in gaseous form at room temperature, making it suitable for several applications, including lighting.\n\n**Physical and Chemical Properties:**\n1. **Inertness:** Krypton is chemically inert, which means it does not react easily with other elements. This makes it suitable for use in neon lighting, where a stable and non-reactive gas is needed.\n2. **Low Thermal Conductivity:** Krypton's low thermal conductivity helps prevent heat loss, which is beneficial in lighting applications.\n3. **Light Emission:** Krypton emits a bright white light when electrified, which can be used in high-intensity discharge lamps.\n\n**Additional Constraint:**\n- **Density:** Krypton is denser than air, making it useful for lighting applications where a stable, heavier gas is needed to prevent diffusion losses.\n\n**Other Industries and Applications:**\n1. **Insulation:** Krypton is used in energy-efficient windows as an insulating gas. Due to its low thermal conductivity and high density, it provides better insulation than air, reducing heat transfer between the interior and exterior of buildings.\n   \n2. **Photography and Lighting:** Krypton is used in some photographic flashes for high-speed photography, where a bright, intense flash is required. Its ability to produce a bright white light makes it suitable for this purpose.\n\n3. **Lasers:** Krypton is used in some types of gas lasers, like krypton fluoride lasers, which are used for various scientific and industrial applications, including nuclear fusion research and laser eye surgery.\n\n**Electron Configuration in LaTeX:**\nThe electron configuration of Krypton (Kr) is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Kr: } 1s^2 \\, 2s^2 \\, 2p^6 \\, 3s^2 \\, 3p^6 \\, 4s^2 \\, 3d^{10} \\, 4p^6\n\\]\n\nThis configuration highlights Krypton's complete outer shell, which contributes to its stability and inertness."
