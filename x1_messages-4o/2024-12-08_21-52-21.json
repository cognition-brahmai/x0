You know that each coin has a value of either 1 cent or 5 cents, but you don't know the exact breakdown. \nYou are allowed to randomly select 10 coins from the piggy bank without replacement. \nYour task is to determine, with a confidence level of at least 95%, the percentage of coins in the piggy bank that have a value of 5 cents. \nTo make things more challenging, imagine that the piggy bank belongs to a person with a variable income. The person's monthly salary fluctuates randomly by 10% each month. How would you modify your approach to account for this possibility?"

        "content": "To tackle this problem, we need to approach it in two stages: first, estimating the percentage of 5-cent coins, and second, accounting for the variable income of the piggy bank owner.\n\n### Stage 1: Estimating the Percentage of 5-Cent Coins\n\n1. **Random Sampling**: Randomly select 10 coins from the piggy bank. This is your sample.\n\n2. **Count 5-Cent Coins**: Count how many of these 10 coins are 5-cent coins. Let's call this number \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Estimate Proportion**: The proportion of 5-cent coins in your sample is \\( \\hat{p} = \\frac{x}{10} \\).\n\n4. **Confidence Interval**: To achieve a 95% confidence level for your estimate of the proportion of 5-cent coins in the entire piggy bank, use the formula for the confidence interval of a proportion:\n   \\[\n   \\text{CI} = \\hat{p} \\pm Z \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   - \\( \\hat{p} \\) is the sample proportion.\n   - \\( Z \\) is the Z-score corresponding to a 95% confidence level (approximately 1.96 for a two-tailed test).\n   - \\( n \\) is the sample size, which is 10.\n\n5. **Calculate CI**: Plug the values into the formula to find the confidence interval.\n\n### Stage 2: Accounting for Variable Income\n\nGiven that the owner\u2019s income fluctuates, our concern is whether this affects the composition of the coins in the piggy bank. If the income influences how coins are deposited (for example, more 5-cent coins are added in months of higher income), this could introduce variability in the coin distribution over time.\n\n1. **Time-Series Analysis**: If the income affects the composition of the piggy bank, analyze the pattern over several months. This would require more data collection over time to see if the coin distribution changes with income fluctuations.\n\n2. **Adjust Sampling**: If income impacts the distribution, consider adjusting your sampling method to account for potential biases. For instance, sample at different times to capture the variance introduced by the income changes.\n\n3. **Dynamic Sampling Plan**: Develop a sampling plan that considers the variability in income. This might involve taking multiple samples at different times and pooling the results to get a better overall estimate.\n\nBy combining these approaches, you can estimate the percentage of 5-cent coins with a high degree of confidence while accounting for the potential impact of the owner's variable income."
