        "content": "To make fields optional in a Django form, you need to ensure that both the model and the form are set up correctly to allow null and blank values. From the code you provided, it looks like you have already set `null=True` and `blank=True` for both `begin` and `end` fields in your `Circuit` model, which should allow those fields to be optional at the database level and in Django forms. However, if they are still showing up as required in the form, there are a few things you can check or do:\n\n1. **Form Field Requirements**: Even though your model fields allow `null` and `blank`, it's possible that the form fields are being marked as required by default. You can explicitly set them to not required in the form's `__init__` method:\n\n    ```python\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super(CircuitForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n        self.fields['begin'].widget = widgets.AdminSplitDateTime()\n        self.fields['end'].widget = widgets.AdminSplitDateTime()\n        self.fields['begin'].required = False\n        self.fields['end'].required = False\n    ```\n\n2. **Check HTML Template**: Ensure that your HTML template does not have any attributes or JavaScript that might be enforcing these fields to be required.\n\n3. **Form Validation**: Double-check if there are any custom validation methods (like `clean()` or field-specific cleaning methods) that might be triggering these fields to be validated as required.\n\n4. **Clear Browser Cache**: Sometimes, browser caching can cause old versions of your form to be displayed. Clear your browser cache or try in an incognito window to ensure you're seeing the latest version of your form.\n\n5. **Django Version**: Ensure that your Django version is up to date and compatible with the way you're defining your form fields. There might be version-specific issues affecting how forms are handled.\n\nAfter making sure these points are addressed, your form fields should be treated as optional."
