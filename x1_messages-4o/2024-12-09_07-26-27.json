Unlike `TreeExplainer`, the `LinearExplainer` requires a masker. Could you please explain what this masker does and what is the difference between the independent and partition maskers? And if I am interested in the important features from the test-set, should I fit the masker on the training set or the test set? Here is a snippet of my code:\n```\nmodel = LogisticRegression(random_state = 1)\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\nmasker = shap.maskers.Independent(data = X_train)\n**or**\nmasker = shap.maskers.Independent(data = X_test)\n\nexplainer = shap.LinearExplainer(model, masker = masker)\nshap_val = explainer(X_test)\n```"

        "content": "In the `shap` package, a masker is used to handle how feature values are \"masked\" or perturbed to simulate missingness when computing Shapley values. This is important for methods like SHAP that rely on perturbing input features to understand their impact on the model's predictions.\n\n### Maskers in SHAP\n\n1. **Independent Masker**: This masker treats each feature independently. When a feature is masked, its value is replaced with a value drawn from the feature's marginal distribution, based on the provided data. This is suitable when features are assumed to be independent, which isn't always the case in real-world datasets.\n\n2. **Partition Masker**: This masker accounts for feature dependencies by partitioning features into groups and masking entire groups at once. This can be beneficial when features are correlated, as it attempts to maintain the natural relationships between features during masking.\n\n### Choosing Between Training and Test Set\n\nWhen deciding whether to fit the masker on the training or test set:\n\n- **Training Set**: Generally, maskers should be fit on the training data. This is because the training data provides a more representative distribution of feature values that the model has learned from. Using the training set helps ensure that the masking process reflects the data the model was trained on, which is important for accurately estimating feature importance.\n\n- **Test Set**: Fitting a masker on the test set can be useful when you believe the test set better represents the feature distribution you care about, or when you're specifically interested in understanding feature importance for a particular test set. However, this may lead to biased interpretations if the test set differs significantly from the training set.\n\n### Code Snippet Guidance\n\nBased on the above considerations, it is generally recommended to fit the masker on the training set:\n\n```python\nmasker = shap.maskers.Independent(data = X_train)\nexplainer = shap.LinearExplainer(model, masker = masker)\nshap_values = explainer(X_test)\n```\n\nThis setup will help ensure that the masker uses a distribution of feature values that the model has been exposed to during training. Consequently, the SHAP values computed will reflect the model's understanding of feature importance based on what it has learned from the training data."
