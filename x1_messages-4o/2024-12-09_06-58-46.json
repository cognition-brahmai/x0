        "content": "To print the error or exception within the `except` block in Python, you can use the `as` keyword to assign the exception to a variable. Here's how you can modify your code snippet to print the exception:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Your code that may raise an exception\n    ...\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n```\n\nIn this example, `Exception` is the base class for all built-in exceptions, and `e` is the variable that stores the exception instance. You can then print `e` to see the error message associated with the exception. If you want to print the full traceback, you can use the `traceback` module:\n\n```python\nimport traceback\n\ntry:\n    # Your code that may raise an exception\n    ...\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n    traceback.print_exc()\n```\n\nThis will give you a detailed traceback of where the error occurred, which is especially useful for debugging."
