        "content": "Certainly! To add exception handling to your code for handling invalid input, you can use a `try-except` block. Here's a simple example in Python:\n\n```python\ndef multiply_by_ten():\n    try:\n        user_input = input(\"Enter a number: \")\n        number = float(user_input)  # Convert input to a float\n        result = number * 10\n        print(\"The result is:\", result)\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a valid number.\")\n\nmultiply_by_ten()\n```\n\n### How It Works:\n- **`try`:** This block contains the code that you want to execute. It attempts to convert the user's input to a float and multiply it by 10.\n- **`except ValueError:`** If a `ValueError` exception is raised (which occurs when the input cannot be converted to a float, such as when the user enters a non-numeric string), the code within this block will execute, and an error message will be displayed.\n\nYou can run this code and test it with various inputs to see how it handles both valid and invalid cases."
