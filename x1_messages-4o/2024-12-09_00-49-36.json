It is not functioning properly and every time I attempt to use it with the shortcut 'Ctrl + Shift', it merely displays a loading message. I am currently working with Python and Django, and have 'ms-python.python' installed. I also have 'Djaneiro' installed. Despite these, Intellisense is still not working. What could be the problem?"

        "content": "It can be frustrating when IntelliSense doesn't work as expected in Visual Studio Code. Let\u2019s troubleshoot and try to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check for Updates**: \n   - Make sure both Visual Studio Code and the Python extension (`ms-python.python`) are up to date. Sometimes, issues are resolved in newer versions.\n\n2. **Extension Conflicts**:\n   - Disable other extensions temporarily to see if they might be conflicting with the Python extension or IntelliSense.\n\n3. **Python Path**:\n   - Ensure that the Python interpreter is correctly set for your workspace. You can select the correct interpreter by clicking on the Python version shown in the bottom-left corner of VS Code or through the Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P`) by typing `Python: Select Interpreter`.\n\n4. **Virtual Environment**:\n   - If you are using a virtual environment, ensure that it is activated in VS Code. This can be done by selecting the correct interpreter associated with your virtual environment.\n\n5. **Language Server**:\n   - Check the language server settings. You can switch between the default language server and Pylance. Go to your settings (`Ctrl + ,`) and search for `Python \u203a Language Server`. Try switching between `Jedi` and `Pylance` to see if that resolves the issue.\n\n6. **Clear Language Server Cache**:\n   - Sometimes, clearing the language server cache can help. You can do this by deleting the `.vscode/Python` folder in your workspace directory.\n\n7. **Reinstall the Extension**:\n   - Uninstall and then reinstall the Python extension (`ms-python.python`). This can sometimes fix underlying issues.\n\n8. **Check Output and Problems Panel**:\n   - Open the Output Panel (`Ctrl + Shift + U`) and select `Python` from the drop-down menu to see if there are any error messages that might give you more insight.\n   - Also, check the Problems Panel (`Ctrl + Shift + M`) for any errors or warnings.\n\n9. **User and Workspace Settings**:\n   - Review both user and workspace settings for any configurations that might affect IntelliSense. Reset any unusual settings to default.\n\n10. **Restart VS Code**:\n    - As a simple measure, try restarting VS Code after making changes to see if the problem resolves.\n\n11. **Check Logs**:\n    - If the issue persists, you can check the logs for more details. Go to `Help` > `Toggle Developer Tools` and check the console for any errors.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue with IntelliSense in Visual Studio Code. If the problem remains unresolved, consider reaching out to the VS Code community forums or checking the GitHub issues page for similar problems."
