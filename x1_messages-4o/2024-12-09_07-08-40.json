For instance, in Ruby, I can use the following command:\n\n```ruby\nfoo = `cat /tmp/baz`\n```\n\nI've tried using the os.system(\"cat /tmp/baz\") function in Python, but it results in the output being sent to standard out and I receive the error code of the operation. How can I achieve the same functionality in Python?"

        "content": "In Python, the equivalent of using backticks for command substitution, as found in Ruby and Perl, can be achieved using the `subprocess` module. Specifically, you can use the `subprocess.run` function along with `subprocess.PIPE` to capture the output of a command. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\n# Run the command and capture the output\nresult = subprocess.run(['cat', '/tmp/baz'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)\n\n# Get the output from the result\noutput = result.stdout\n\nprint(output)\n```\n\nIn this example, `subprocess.run` is used to execute the command. The `stdout=subprocess.PIPE` argument is used to capture the output of the command, and `text=True` (or `universal_newlines=True` in older versions of Python) is used to treat the output as a string, making it easier to work with. The result is stored in `result.stdout`.\n\nThis approach is generally preferred over using the older `os.system` or `os.popen` functions, as `subprocess` provides more powerful and flexible ways to manage and communicate with subprocesses."
