The code runs fine on my desktop with Python 3.8.5, but it throws a warning when I run it on a VM server with Python 3.9.5. The warning message is as follows:\n\n```\nC:\\ProgramData\\Miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\io\\sql.py:758: UserWarning: pandas only support SQLAlchemy connectable(engine/connection) or\ndatabase string URI or sqlite3 DBAPI2 connection\nother DBAPI2 objects are not tested, please consider using SQLAlchemy\n  warnings.warn(\n```\n\nHere is a simplified version of my code that triggers the warning:\n\n```\nmyserver_string = \"xxxxxxxxx,nnnn\"\ndb_string = \"xxxxxx\"\n\ncnxn = \"Driver={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};Server=tcp:\"+myserver_string+\";Database=\"+db_string +\";TrustServerCertificate=no;Connection Timeout=600;Authentication=ActiveDirectoryIntegrated;\"\n\ndef readAnyTable(tablename, date):\n    conn = pyodbc.connect(cnxn)\n    \n    query_result = pd.read_sql_query(\n            ''' \n                 SELECT *\n                 FROM [{0}].[dbo].[{1}]\n                where Asof >= '{2}'\n            '''.format(db_string,tablename,date,), conn)\n            \n    conn.close()\n    \n    return query_result\n```\n\nAre there any changes in Python 3.9.5 that might lead to this warning? Is pyodbc becoming deprecated? How can I modify my code to achieve similar results without triggering this warning?"

        "content": "The warning message you're encountering is related to the way pandas handles database connections. In recent versions, pandas has been moving towards greater integration with SQLAlchemy for database operations, which provides a more consistent and powerful interface for interacting with databases. This is not specific to Python 3.9.5, but rather a change in pandas itself to encourage the use of SQLAlchemy.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use SQLAlchemy, which should eliminate the warning:\n\n1. **Install SQLAlchemy** (if you haven't already):\n   You can install SQLAlchemy using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install sqlalchemy\n   ```\n\n2. **Modify your code** to use SQLAlchemy for the database connection:\n\n   ```python\n   from sqlalchemy import create_engine\n   import pandas as pd\n\n   myserver_string = \"xxxxxxxxx,nnnn\"\n   db_string = \"xxxxxx\"\n\n   # Create the connection string for SQLAlchemy\n   connection_string = f\"mssql+pyodbc://@{myserver_string}/{db_string}?driver=ODBC+Driver+17+for+SQL+Server&TrustServerCertificate=no&Authentication=ActiveDirectoryIntegrated\"\n\n   # Create an SQLAlchemy engine\n   engine = create_engine(connection_string)\n\n   def readAnyTable(tablename, date):\n       # Use the engine to execute the query\n       query = f'''\n           SELECT *\n           FROM [{db_string}].[dbo].[{tablename}]\n           WHERE Asof >= '{date}'\n       '''\n       \n       # Use a context manager to ensure the connection is closed\n       with engine.connect() as conn:\n           query_result = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)\n\n       return query_result\n   ```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **SQLAlchemy Engine**: Instead of using `pyodbc.connect`, we create an engine using SQLAlchemy. This engine is then used to manage the connection with the database.\n  \n- **Connection String**: The connection string format has changed to accommodate SQLAlchemy's requirements. Note the `mssql+pyodbc://` prefix, which tells SQLAlchemy to use the pyodbc driver for Microsoft SQL Server.\n\n- **Context Manager**: Using `with engine.connect() as conn` ensures that the database connection is properly managed, and it will automatically close the connection once the block is exited.\n\nThis approach should resolve the warning and provide a more robust way of handling database connections in pandas, aligning with the library's recommended practices."
