Your task is to retrieve the titles of books related to machine learning that have a rating of 4.0 or higher, sorted in descending order by publication date. However, the catch is that you can only use a single line of code to accomplish this task. Can you come up with the solution?"

Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ntitles = sorted([book['title'] for book in dataset if 'machine learning' in book['tags'] and book['rating'] >= 4.0], key=lambda x: next(book['publication date'] for book in dataset if book['title'] == x), reverse=True)\n```\n\nThis line of code filters the books related to machine learning with a rating of 4.0 or higher and sorts them by publication date in descending order."
