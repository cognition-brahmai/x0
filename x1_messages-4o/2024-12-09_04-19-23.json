How can I subclass the ReadElement to contain an additional field? I tried the following:\n\n```python\nclass LookupElement(ReadElement):\n    def __new__(self, address, value, lookups):\n        self = super(LookupElement, self).__new__(address, value)\n        l = list(self)\n        l.append(lookups)\n        return tuple(l)\n```\n\nHowever, the tuple is created there and then in the `new` statement. If I modify self to be a list, I will lose the type information. How can I avoid this?"

        "content": "To create a subclass of a named tuple while adding an additional field, you can subclass the `ReadElement` and override the `__new__` method to include the new field. However, you need to ensure that the return value is an instance of the subclass. You can achieve this by utilizing the `super()` correctly and structuring the subclass properly.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import namedtuple\n\n# Define the original named tuple\nReadElement = namedtuple('ReadElement', 'address value')\n\n# Define the subclass with an additional field\nclass LookupElement(ReadElement):\n    __slots__ = ()  # No additional instance attributes are allowed\n    _fields = ReadElement._fields + ('lookups',)  # Extend the fields\n\n    def __new__(cls, address, value, lookups):\n        # Call the parent `__new__` with the original fields, then add the new field\n        return super(LookupElement, cls).__new__(cls, address, value) + (lookups,)\n\n# Example usage\nlookup_instance = LookupElement(address='0x1234', value=42, lookups=['lookup1', 'lookup2'])\nprint(lookup_instance)  # Output: LookupElement(address='0x1234', value=42, lookups=['lookup1', 'lookup2'])\n```\n\nIn this approach:\n\n- We extend the `_fields` attribute to include the new field `lookups`.\n- We override the `__new__` method to create an instance of `LookupElement`. We call the parent class's `__new__` method with the original fields and concatenate the new field to the result.\n- By using `__slots__ = ()`, we ensure that no additional instance attributes are allowed, which is consistent with the behavior of named tuples.\n"
