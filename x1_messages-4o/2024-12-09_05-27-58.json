        "content": "In Python, the `range` function is specifically designed for integer sequences and does not support floating-point numbers. Therefore, you cannot use `range` to check if a floating-point number lies within a certain range. Instead, you can use simple conditional statements to achieve this.\n\nHere's how you can check if a variable `x` lies within the range of 0 to 0.5:\n\n```python\nx = 0.3  # Example value\n\nif 0 <= x <= 0.5:\n    print(\"x is within the range 0 to 0.5\")\nelse:\n    print(\"x is outside the range 0 to 0.5\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the condition `0 <= x <= 0.5` checks if `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 0.5. If both conditions are true, it prints that `x` is within the range; otherwise, it indicates that `x` is outside the range."
