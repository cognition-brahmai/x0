The aim is to use the same title in these two places, which is provided by other derived templates. However, I'm encountering an error that says \"block 'title' defined twice\". How can I resolve this issue? Here is the template code I'm using:\n\n```\n<title>{% block title %}{% endblock %} - example.com</title>\n[...]\n\n<h1> \n  {% block title %}{% endblock %} - example.com\n</h1>\n```\n\nAnd here is the error message I'm receiving: \n\n```\nlines = [self.message, '  ' + location]\n: block 'title' defined twice\n```"

        "content": "In Jinja2, each block within a template must have a unique name. When you define two blocks with the same name, Jinja2 throws an error because it cannot differentiate between them. To resolve this issue, you need to use different block names for the `<title>` tag and the `<h1>` tag, but you can still use a single variable to populate both if you want them to have the same content.\n\nHere's one way to achieve this:\n\n1. In your base template, define unique block names for the title in the `<title>` tag and the `<h1>` tag. For example, use `title_tag` for the `<title>` tag and `title_header` for the `<h1>` tag.\n\n2. In your derived templates, use the same content for both blocks.\n\nHere's how you can modify your template:\n\n**Base Template:**\n\n```html\n<title>{% block title_tag %}{% endblock %} - example.com</title>\n[...]\n\n<h1>\n  {% block title_header %}{% endblock %} - example.com\n</h1>\n```\n\n**Derived Template:**\n\n```jinja\n{% extends \"base_template.html\" %}\n\n{% block title_tag %}\nPage Title\n{% endblock %}\n\n{% block title_header %}\nPage Title\n{% endblock %}\n```\n\nThis way, you maintain unique block names but can still use the same content for both the `<title>` tag and `<h1>` tag. If you want to ensure consistency and avoid repeating yourself, consider using a variable that you define in the derived template and then use it in both blocks:\n\n**Derived Template with Variable:**\n\n```jinja\n{% extends \"base_template.html\" %}\n\n{% set page_title = \"Page Title\" %}\n\n{% block title_tag %}\n{{ page_title }}\n{% endblock %}\n\n{% block title_header %}\n{{ page_title }}\n{% endblock %}\n```\n\nThis approach keeps your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and ensures that any change to the title only needs to be made in one place."
