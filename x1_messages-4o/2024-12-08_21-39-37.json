For instance, you may be interested in its history, dimensions, location, or visitor information. Here's a basic example of a SQL query that could be used if you had a database with relevant information:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    name, \n    location, \n    height, \n    construction_year, \n    architect, \n    visitor_count \nFROM \n    landmarks \nWHERE \n    name = 'Eiffel Tower';\n```\n\nIn this query:\n\n- `name`, `location`, `height`, `construction_year`, `architect`, and `visitor_count` are columns in the `landmarks` table.\n- The `WHERE` clause specifies that you're looking for information specifically about the Eiffel Tower.\n\nPlease adjust the column names and table name according to your actual database schema. If you're querying an API or another type of data source, the query format will be different, typically using an HTTP request with specific parameters."
