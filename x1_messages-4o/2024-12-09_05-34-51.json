I have a dictionary with a single key, and I am looping over the keys, deleting the current key, and adding a new key which is the current key + 1. I believe this should create an infinite loop, printing out each key as it goes, but it only prints out 5 keys (0 through 4) and then stops. Why is Python only running this loop 5 times instead of indefinitely as intended?\n\nHere is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nx = {0: None}\n\nfor i in x:\n    del x[i]\n    x[i+1] = None  # Value doesn't matter, so I set it to None\n    print(i)\n```"

        "content": "The behavior you're experiencing is due to the way Python handles dictionary iteration and modification during iteration. When you iterate over a dictionary in Python, you're iterating over a snapshot of the keys when the loop begins. Modifying the dictionary (such as deleting or adding keys) during iteration can lead to unexpected behaviors.\n\nIn your code, when you delete a key and add a new key within the loop, Python is effectively invalidating the iterator. Here\u2019s a step-by-step explanation of what\u2019s happening:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The dictionary `x` starts with `{0: None}`.\n2. **First Iteration**: \n   - `i` is 0.\n   - The key `0` is deleted.\n   - The key `1` is added, resulting in `{1: None}`.\n   - The value `0` is printed.\n3. The loop checks the next key in the snapshot taken at the beginning of the loop, but since the snapshot only had one key initially (key `0`), there are no more keys to iterate over.\n\nPython doesn\u2019t automatically adjust the iteration context to consider the changes made to the dictionary during iteration, which is why the loop ends prematurely after printing five keys.\n\nTo achieve an infinite loop with dictionary modifications, you could use a `while` loop instead. Here's a modified version of your code that behaves as you intend:\n\n```python\nx = {0: None}\ni = 0\n\nwhile True:\n    print(i)\n    del x[i]\n    i += 1\n    x[i] = None\n```\n\nIn this version, the `while` loop ensures that you continuously update `i` and the dictionary, and it will run indefinitely as long as you don't manually stop the program."
