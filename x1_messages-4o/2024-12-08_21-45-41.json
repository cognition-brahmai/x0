You have been provided with a video recording of the neighborhood from a surveillance camera. The video shows a car passing by the house in question twice, and the license plate of the car is partially visible. You need to calculate the time of the day when the car passed by the house for the first time based on the following information:\n- The video recording is 30 minutes long.\n- The car passed by the house for the second time at exactly 3:15 PM.\n- The distance between the two passings is exactly 10 miles.\n- The speed limit on the street where the house is located is 40 miles per hour.\n- The car was driving at a constant speed during both passings.\nWhat is the time of the day when the car passed by the house for the first time?"

        "content": "To determine the time when the car passed by the house for the first time, we can use the information provided about the distance, speed, and the time of the second passing.\n\n1. **Distance and Speed**: The distance between the two passings is 10 miles, and the car is driving at a constant speed of 40 miles per hour.\n\n2. **Calculate Time Difference**: \n   - Time taken to travel 10 miles at 40 miles per hour is calculated using the formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{10 \\text{ miles}}{40 \\text{ miles per hour}} = 0.25 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n   - Convert 0.25 hours to minutes: \n     \\[\n     0.25 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = 15 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine First Passing Time**:\n   - The car passed by the house for the second time at 3:15 PM. \n   - Subtract the time taken to travel back to the original point (15 minutes) from 3:15 PM:\n     \\[\n     3:15 \\text{ PM} - 15 \\text{ minutes} = 3:00 \\text{ PM}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the car passed by the house for the first time at 3:00 PM."
