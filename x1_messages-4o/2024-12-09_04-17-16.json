        "content": "Creating an array of `thrust::device_vector` objects directly is indeed not feasible because `thrust::device_vector` objects manage memory on the GPU, and their sizes cannot be dynamically adjusted as elements of a standard array. However, you can achieve similar functionality using a vector of `device_vector` objects, as `thrust::device_vector` can be contained in a standard C++ container like `std::vector`.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you can create a vector of `thrust::device_vector`:\n\n```cpp\n#include <thrust/device_vector.h>\n#include <vector>\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    // Number of device_vectors you want to create\n    const size_t num_vectors = 5;\n    // Size of each device_vector\n    const size_t vector_size = 10;\n\n    // Create a vector of device_vectors\n    std::vector<thrust::device_vector<int>> device_vectors(num_vectors, thrust::device_vector<int>(vector_size));\n\n    // Initialize each device_vector\n    for (size_t i = 0; i < num_vectors; ++i) {\n        thrust::fill(device_vectors[i].begin(), device_vectors[i].end(), static_cast<int>(i));\n    }\n\n    // Access and print the elements of each device_vector\n    for (size_t i = 0; i < num_vectors; ++i) {\n        thrust::host_vector<int> host_vector = device_vectors[i]; // Transfer data to host\n        std::cout << \"device_vector \" << i << \": \";\n        for (size_t j = 0; j < vector_size; ++j) {\n            std::cout << host_vector[j] << \" \";\n        }\n        std::cout << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n1. We declare a `std::vector` that holds multiple `thrust::device_vector<int>` objects.\n2. Each `device_vector` is initialized with a specified size.\n3. We use `thrust::fill` to initialize each `device_vector` with a value that corresponds to its index in the array.\n4. Finally, we copy the contents of each `device_vector` back to the host for display.\n\nThis approach allows you to manage multiple `thrust::device_vector` objects dynamically, as you would with an array, while leveraging C++ standard library containers."
