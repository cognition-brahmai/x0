        "content": "In shell scripting, specifically in Bash, there is no native Boolean data type. However, you can simulate Boolean logic using integers or strings. The common practice is to use `0` for true and `1` for false, or you can use strings like `\"true\"` and `\"false\"`. Here's how you can correctly declare, use, and update Boolean-like variables in a shell script:\n\n### Using Integers\n\n1. **Declare and Update:**\n\n```bash\nvariable=0  # 0 for true\n# or\nvariable=1  # 1 for false\n```\n\n2. **Use in Conditional Expressions:**\n\n```bash\nif [ $variable -eq 0 ]; then\n    echo \"Variable is true\"\nelse\n    echo \"Variable is false\"\nfi\n```\n\n3. **Negation:**\n\nTo negate the variable, you can switch its value:\n\n```bash\nif [ $variable -ne 0 ]; then\n    echo \"Variable is false\"\nelse\n    echo \"Variable is true\"\nfi\n```\n\n### Using Strings\n\n1. **Declare and Update:**\n\n```bash\nvariable=\"true\"\n# or\nvariable=\"false\"\n```\n\n2. **Use in Conditional Expressions:**\n\n```bash\nif [ \"$variable\" = \"true\" ]; then\n    echo \"Variable is true\"\nelse\n    echo \"Variable is false\"\nfi\n```\n\n3. **Negation:**\n\nYou can negate by checking the opposite string:\n\n```bash\nif [ \"$variable\" != \"true\" ]; then\n    echo \"Variable is false\"\nelse\n    echo \"Variable is true\"\nfi\n```\n\n### Important Considerations\n\n- **Quoting:** Always quote your variables when doing string comparisons to avoid errors when the variable is empty or contains spaces.\n- **Test Command Alternates:** The `[` command is a synonym for `test`, but you might also see `[[ ... ]]` in more advanced scripts, which is more robust and flexible.\n\nBy following these patterns, you can effectively use Boolean-like variables in your shell scripts."
