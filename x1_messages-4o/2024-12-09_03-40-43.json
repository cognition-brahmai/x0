I am currently grouping by 'Name' and 'Rank' and getting aggregate values using the following code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'Name': ['foo', 'bar'] * 3,\n                   'Rank': np.random.randint(0,3,6),\n                   'Val': np.random.rand(6)})\n\ngroup = df.groupby(['Name', 'Rank'])\nagg = group.agg(sum)\n\nprint(agg)\n```\n\nThe output looks like this:\n\n```\n                Val\nName Rank          \nbar  0     1.839091\n     2     0.381515\nfoo  0     0.817097\n     1     0.209324\n```\n\nI want to get a 'Group_id' field in the original df that contains the group number for that row, like this:\n\n```python\ndf['Group_id'] = [2, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1]\n```\n\nWhich would yield:\n\n```\n  Name  Rank       Val  Group_id\n0  foo     0  0.299397         2\n1  bar     0  0.909228         0\n2  foo     0  0.517700         2\n3  bar     0  0.929863         0\n4  foo     1  0.209324         3\n5  bar     2  0.381515         1\n```\n\nI can achieve this using itertools' count function, but it's slow on a large DataFrame. Is there a better, more efficient way to do this in pandas?"

        "content": "You can achieve this more efficiently using the `ngroup()` method in pandas, which assigns a unique group number to each group. Here's how you can modify your code to include a 'Group_id' field:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create the DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'Name': ['foo', 'bar'] * 3,\n                   'Rank': np.random.randint(0, 3, 6),\n                   'Val': np.random.rand(6)})\n\n# Group by 'Name' and 'Rank'\ngroup = df.groupby(['Name', 'Rank'])\n\n# Add 'Group_id' to the original DataFrame\ndf['Group_id'] = group.ngroup()\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThe `ngroup()` function will assign a unique identifier to each group, and it's typically more efficient than manually iterating over the groups. This should work well even for larger DataFrames."
