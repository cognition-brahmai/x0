However, Python is interpreting these backslashes as escape sequences rather than literal backslashes. The code I have is:\n```python\nimport os\npath = os.getcwd()\nfinal = path +'\\xulrunner.exe ' + path + '\\application.ini'\nprint(final)\n```\nThe expected output is `C:\\Users\\me\\xulrunner.exe C:\\Users\\me\\application.ini`. Instead, I am getting a `SyntaxError: (unicode error) 'unicodeescape' codec can't decode bytes in position 0-1: truncated \\xXX escape`. How can I include a literal backslash in my string without Python interpreting it as an escape sequence?"

        "content": "To include literal backslashes in a string without them being interpreted as escape sequences in Python, you can use raw strings by prefixing the string with `r`. This tells Python to treat backslashes as literal characters. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport os\npath = os.getcwd()\nfinal = path + r'\\xulrunner.exe ' + path + r'\\application.ini'\nprint(final)\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can escape each backslash by doubling them:\n\n```python\nimport os\npath = os.getcwd()\nfinal = path + '\\\\xulrunner.exe ' + path + '\\\\application.ini'\nprint(final)\n```\n\nBoth methods will ensure that the backslashes are treated as literal backslashes in the output."
