I am able to pass this variable to my templates and access all the properties of the Model such as `section.name`, `section.id`, etc. My application contains a model called `Books` which has a Foreign Key to the `Sections` model. How can I, when iterating over the `secs` variable in my template, access the count of Books for each Section? Is it possible to do something like `{{ sec.Books.count }}`?"

        "content": "To achieve this functionality in your Django application, you can make use of Django's reverse relationship feature. When you have a `ForeignKey` from the `Books` model to the `Sections` model, Django automatically creates a reverse relationship that you can use to access related `Book` objects from a `Section` instance.\n\nIn your template, you can access the related `Books` for each `Section` using the reverse lookup. By default, Django creates a related name for the reverse lookup by appending `_set` to the lowercased model name unless you specify a `related_name` in the `ForeignKey` field. Here's how you can access the count of `Books` for each `Section`:\n\n1. **Model Definition**: First, ensure your `Books` model is defined with a `ForeignKey` to the `Sections` model:\n\n   ```python\n   class Sections(models.Model):\n       name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n       order = models.IntegerField()\n\n   class Books(models.Model):\n       title = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n       section = models.ForeignKey(Sections, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n   ```\n\n2. **Template Iteration**: In your template, you can iterate over the `secs` variable and use the reverse lookup to get the count of related `Books`:\n\n   ```html\n   {% for sec in secs %}\n       <p>Section: {{ sec.name }}</p>\n       <p>Number of Books: {{ sec.books_set.count }}</p>\n   {% endfor %}\n   ```\n\nHere, `books_set` is the default related manager for the `Books` model. If you have specified a `related_name` in your `Books` model's `ForeignKey` field, you should use that name instead:\n\n```python\nclass Books(models.Model):\n    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    section = models.ForeignKey(Sections, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='books')\n```\n\nThen, in your template, you would use `{{ sec.books.count }}`.\n\nBy leveraging reverse relationships, you can efficiently access related objects and their counts directly in your templates."
