I have provided a simple example of my code below. I believe the error might be occurring because Python is trying to write byte strings to the file instead of unicode objects. Is this a bug in Python, or am I misunderstanding something? I am using a standard Python 2.6 installation.\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\ndef logging_test():\n    handler = logging.FileHandler(\"/home/ted/logfile.txt\", \"w\",\n                                  encoding = \"UTF-8\")\n    formatter = logging.Formatter(\"%(message)s\")\n    handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n    root_logger = logging.getLogger()\n    root_logger.addHandler(handler)\n    root_logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)\n\n    # This is an o with a hat on it.\n    byte_string = '\\xc3\\xb4'\n    unicode_string = unicode(\"\\xc3\\xb4\", \"utf-8\")\n\n    print \"printed unicode object: %s\" % unicode_string\n\n    # Explode\n    root_logger.info(unicode_string)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    logging_test()\n```\n\nIn Python's logging package, it is using the codecs package to open the log file and is passing in the \"UTF-8\" argument as the encoding. However, it appears to be writing byte strings to the file instead of unicode objects. Essentially, Python is doing:\n\n```python\nfile_handler.write(unicode_string.encode(\"UTF-8\"))\n```\n\nWhen it should be doing:\n\n```python\nfile_handler.write(unicode_string)\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to how Python 2.6 handles string encoding and the logging module. Python 2.6 doesn't handle Unicode as seamlessly as Python 3, where strings are Unicode by default. In Python 2.6, you need to ensure that the strings you pass to the logging functions are Unicode objects, not byte strings.\n\nHere's a breakdown and a solution for your code:\n\n1. **Ensure Unicode Strings**: Make sure that any string you log is a Unicode string. You are already converting your byte string to a Unicode string with `unicode(\"\\xc3\\xb4\", \"utf-8\")`, which is correct.\n\n2. **Set the Encoding in FileHandler**: You are correctly setting the encoding to \"UTF-8\" in the `FileHandler`, which is necessary for writing Unicode strings to the file.\n\n3. **Formatter**: Ensure that your formatter does not interfere with the Unicode handling. Your formatter is simple and shouldn't cause issues as it is.\n\nThe issue may arise if the root logger or any other logger is not handling the Unicode correctly. In Python 2.6, you must ensure that everything is consistently using Unicode. The logging module itself should be capable of handling Unicode strings if the configuration is correct.\n\nHere's a revised version of your code, which should work without raising `UnicodeDecodeError`:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\ndef logging_test():\n    handler = logging.FileHandler(\"/home/ted/logfile.txt\", \"w\", encoding=\"UTF-8\")\n    formatter = logging.Formatter(\"%(message)s\")\n    handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n    root_logger = logging.getLogger()\n    \n    # Remove other handlers that might interfere\n    if root_logger.handlers:\n        for handler in root_logger.handlers:\n            root_logger.removeHandler(handler)\n    \n    root_logger.addHandler(handler)\n    root_logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)\n\n    # This is an o with a hat on it.\n    byte_string = '\\xc3\\xb4'\n    unicode_string = unicode(byte_string, \"utf-8\")\n\n    print \"printed unicode object: %s\" % unicode_string\n\n    # Log the unicode string\n    root_logger.info(unicode_string)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    logging_test()\n```\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- **Upgrade to a Newer Python Version**: If possible, consider upgrading to Python 3, where Unicode handling is much more intuitive and less error-prone.\n- **Log Configuration**: Ensure that any additional configuration or external libraries used with logging are also Unicode-compliant.\n- **Consistent Encoding**: Always work with Unicode internally and encode/decode at the boundaries of your system, such as reading from or writing to a file or network.\n\nBy ensuring that the logging system is consistently set up to handle Unicode strings and by passing Unicode objects to it, you should be able to avoid `UnicodeDecodeError`."
