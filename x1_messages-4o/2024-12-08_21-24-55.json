        "content": "Certainly! To replace the equation \\(x^2 + y^2 = z^2\\) with \\(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\\) in a LaTeX document, you would need to locate the specific line of LaTeX code that represents the original equation and modify it accordingly.\n\nThe original LaTeX equation might look something like this:\n\n```latex\nx^2 + y^2 = z^2\n```\n\nTo update it, you will replace `z` with `r`:\n\n```latex\nx^2 + y^2 = r^2\n```\n\nHere's how you would typically implement this change in a LaTeX document, assuming it's within an equation environment:\n\n```latex\n\\begin{equation}\nx^2 + y^2 = r^2\n\\end{equation}\n```\n\nIf this equation is part of a larger set of equations or a document, ensure you locate the specific equation's environment and make the substitution there. Let me know if you need further assistance!"
