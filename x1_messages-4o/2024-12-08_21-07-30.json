Here's a simple C++ code implementation to divide 856 by 12 and obtain the quotient and remainder:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    int dividend = 856;\n    int divisor = 12;\n    \n    int quotient = dividend / divisor;\n    int remainder = dividend % divisor;\n    \n    std::cout << \"Quotient: \" << quotient << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Remainder: \" << remainder << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We declare two integer variables, `dividend` and `divisor`, representing the numbers to be divided.\n- The quotient is calculated using the `/` operator.\n- The remainder is calculated using the `%` operator.\n- Finally, we print the quotient and remainder to the console.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\nQuotient: 71\nRemainder: 4\n```\n\nThis means when 856 is divided by 12, the quotient is 71 and the remainder is 4."
