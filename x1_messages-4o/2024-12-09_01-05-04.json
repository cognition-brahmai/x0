For instance, if I have a list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and my condition checks bool(item%2), I want it to return [None, 1, None, 3, None, 5, None, 7, None, 9, None]. What is the most efficient way to achieve this?"

        "content": "To replace values in a list with `None` based on a condition, you can use a list comprehension in Python. In your case, you want to replace values where `bool(item % 2)` returns `True`. This condition is true for even numbers (since `item % 2` results in `0` for even numbers, and `bool(0)` is `False`).\n\nHere's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\noriginal_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nmodified_list = [item if item % 2 else None for item in original_list]\nprint(modified_list)\n```\n\nThis list comprehension iterates over each `item` in the `original_list` and checks the condition `item % 2`. If the condition is `True` (i.e., the item is odd), it keeps the `item`; otherwise, it replaces it with `None`. The result will be:\n\n```\n[None, 1, None, 3, None, 5, None, 7, None, 9, None]\n```\n\nThis method is efficient and concise, leveraging Python's list comprehensions for both clarity and performance."
