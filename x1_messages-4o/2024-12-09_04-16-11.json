This means that it provides a dynamic view object that reflects the current state of the dictionary. If the dictionary changes, the view reflects these changes. \n\nRegarding time complexity, the `dict.keys()` operation is O(1) because it simply returns a view object that refers to the keys of the dictionary without creating a new list. This makes it efficient in terms of both time and space compared to creating a separate list of keys."
