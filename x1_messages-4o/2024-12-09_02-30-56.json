Here\u2019s a simple way to get the file size:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef get_file_size(file_path):\n    try:\n        file_size = os.path.getsize(file_path)\n        return file_size\n    except OSError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n        return None\n\n# Example usage\nfile_path = 'example.txt'\nsize = get_file_size(file_path)\nif size is not None:\n    print(f\"The size of the file is: {size} bytes\")\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `os.path.getsize(file_path)` is used to get the size of the file in bytes.\n- We handle potential errors using a try-except block, which can catch issues such as the file not existing.\n\nMake sure to replace `'example.txt'` with the actual path to your file."
