        "content": "Yes, there is documentation available for the `gi.repository` module, which is part of PyGObject used for working with Gtk3 in Python. While it might not be in the same format as the PyGtk 2.0 Reference Manual, there are several resources you can use:\n\n1. **GObject Introspection Documentation**: The `gi.repository` module uses GObject Introspection to dynamically access GLib-based libraries like GTK. You can refer to the official GNOME documentation for [GObject Introspection](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GObjectIntrospection) to understand how it works.\n\n2. **GTK 3 Reference Manual**: The C documentation for GTK 3 is very useful. Since PyGObject is essentially a set of Python bindings for these C libraries, the C documentation can often be applied. You can find it [here](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/).\n\n3. **PyGObject Documentation**: This is the Python-specific documentation for using GObject Introspection, and it includes examples and explanations for using GTK+ 3 in Python. You can find the PyGObject documentation at [Read the Docs](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n4. **Examples and Tutorials**: Many developers find practical examples and tutorials helpful. Websites like [GNOME Developer](https://developer.gnome.org/), [Python GTK+ 3 Tutorial](https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and community sites like Stack Overflow can provide valuable insights and examples.\n\n5. **Source Code and Examples**: Sometimes, looking at the source code or various examples on GitHub can be immensely helpful in understanding how to use the `gi.repository` module effectively.\n\nWhile you may not find a one-to-one equivalent of the PyGtk 2.0 Reference Manual for Gtk3, these resources collectively offer comprehensive guidance for working with Gtk3 in Python using the `gi.repository` module."
