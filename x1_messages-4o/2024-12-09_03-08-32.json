I have a piece of code where I'm trying to read a line from data using the readline() function. However, when I tried assigning the variable 'line' inside the while loop condition, I encountered an error. Is there a way to do this while avoiding the use of break and without repeating the readline statement?"

        "content": "In Python, you can\u2019t directly assign a variable within a while loop condition like you can in some other programming languages (such as C or JavaScript). However, you can achieve a similar effect using a different approach, such as using a helper function or utilizing iterators. Here's a way to read lines from a source without repeating the `readline()` statement and avoiding an infinite loop:\n\n### Using iterators\n\nIf you are reading from a file, you can use the file object itself as an iterator. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nwith open('yourfile.txt', 'r') as file:\n    for line in iter(file.readline, ''):\n        # process the line\n        print(line.strip())\n```\n\n### Using a helper function\n\nIf you are not dealing with a file directly, you can use a helper function like this:\n\n```python\ndef read_line(source):\n    return source.readline()\n\nsource = open('yourfile.txt', 'r')\nline = read_line(source)\nwhile line:\n    # process the line\n    print(line.strip())\n    line = read_line(source)\n\nsource.close()\n```\n\n### Using a generator\n\nAnother clean approach is to encapsulate the reading logic within a generator function:\n\n```python\ndef line_reader(source):\n    while True:\n        line = source.readline()\n        if not line:\n            break\n        yield line\n\nwith open('yourfile.txt', 'r') as file:\n    for line in line_reader(file):\n        # process the line\n        print(line.strip())\n```\n\nIn each of these approaches, you effectively manage the line reading without repeating the `readline()` statement within the loop and avoid using a `break` statement."
