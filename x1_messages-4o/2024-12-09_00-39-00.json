However, it works correctly for a divide by zero operation, catching and reporting the error as expected. How can I correctly catch and print the KeyError exception?\n\nCode:\n```\nconnection = manager.connect(\"I2Cx\")\n\ntry:\n    connection = manager.connect(\"I2Cx\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(e)\n```"

        "content": "To catch and print a `KeyError` specifically, ensure that the exception handling block is correctly set up to catch this particular type of error. The code you provided uses a generic exception handler (`except Exception as e:`), which should technically catch any exception, including `KeyError`. However, if the error isn't being caught, there might be something else at play.\n\nHere are a few steps to troubleshoot and ensure you catch the `KeyError`:\n\n1. **Check the Exception Type**: Make sure the exception thrown is indeed a `KeyError`. If you have access to the library or module code, verify that it raises `KeyError` for missing keys.\n\n2. **Catch Specific Exception**: Instead of using a generic `Exception`, catch `KeyError` specifically. This will also help in debugging and understanding any other issues.\n\n3. **Debugging**: Insert print statements or use a debugger to see if the code block is being executed as expected.\n\nHere is how you can modify the code to catch a `KeyError`:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    connection = manager.connect(\"I2Cx\")\nexcept KeyError as e:\n    print(f'Caught a KeyError: {e}')\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f'Caught a different Exception: {e}')\n```\n\n4. **Verify the Exception Source**: If the error still isn't being caught, double-check if the `connect` method is the one causing the error, and it's actually a `KeyError`.\n\n5. **Output**: Ensure your environment is set up to display print statements correctly. Sometimes, configurations may suppress output, especially in certain IDEs or logging settings.\n\nIf none of these suggestions solve the issue, there may be an underlying problem with how the exception is being raised or how your environment is set up. Checking the documentation of the `manager.connect` method or reaching out for support on that specific library may also help."
