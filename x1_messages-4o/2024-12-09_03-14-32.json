However, when I use the command `pip3 install scipy --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org`, I keep encountering the error `Failed building wheel for scipy`. I also tried installing scipy with the `--no-binary` option, but received the same error. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "Installing `scipy` on ARM-based systems can sometimes be challenging due to the need for compiling from source, especially if pre-built wheels are not available. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Dependencies Are Met**: Make sure all the necessary dependencies for building `scipy` are installed on your system. You might need development headers and other build tools. You can try installing them with:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install python3-dev libatlas-base-dev gfortran build-essential\n   ```\n\n2. **Upgrade pip, setuptools, and wheel**: Sometimes, upgrading these tools can resolve building issues, as they might be outdated. Run the following commands:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel\n   ```\n\n3. **Use a Virtual Environment**: Consider setting up a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with system packages. You can set up a virtual environment with:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m venv scipy-env\n   source scipy-env/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n   Then, try installing `scipy` again within this environment.\n\n4. **Check for Pre-built Wheels**: Sometimes pre-built wheels are available for ARM architectures. You can check sites like [https://www.piwheels.org](https://www.piwheels.org) for pre-built wheels that might work on your architecture.\n\n5. **Compile with OpenBLAS**: Ensure that your installation of OpenBLAS is correctly configured and recognized by the build process. You might need to set environment variables to help the compiler find OpenBLAS. For example:\n\n   ```bash\n   export BLAS=/path/to/openblas/lib/libopenblas.a\n   export LAPACK=/path/to/openblas/lib/libopenblas.a\n   ```\n\n   Adjust the paths based on where OpenBLAS is installed on your system.\n\n6. **Check for Logs**: The error message `Failed building wheel for scipy` isn't very specific. Check the complete build log to see if there are more detailed error messages that can give you clues about what's going wrong.\n\n7. **Alternative Installation Methods**: If all else fails, consider using a different method to install `scipy`, such as using `conda` if it's available on your platform, or looking for a system package that might be more straightforward to install.\n\n8. **Scipy Version**: Sometimes the latest version might have issues on certain architectures. You could try installing an older version of `scipy` that might be more compatible:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip3 install scipy==1.5.4\n   ```\n\nIf you've tried all these steps and are still encountering problems, please share any specific error messages or logs, and I can help further."
