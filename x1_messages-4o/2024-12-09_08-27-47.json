        "content": "To exit a Python program without encountering a traceback dump and return an error code, you can use the `sys.exit()` function. When you call `sys.exit()`, you can pass an integer as an argument, which will be used as the exit status. If you want to suppress the traceback only when calling `exit()`, but still allow tracebacks for other exceptions, you can structure your code like this:\n\n1. Use `sys.exit()` for exiting with a specific error code.\n2. Handle exceptions using a try-except block to ensure tracebacks are shown for unhandled exceptions.\n\nHere's an example of how to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        # Your main program logic here\n        # For example, you could raise an exception to test\n        # raise ValueError(\"An error occurred\")\n\n        # Exit with a specific error code\n        sys.exit(1)\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        # Print the traceback for exceptions\n        import traceback\n        traceback.print_exc()\n        # You can also log the exception message if needed\n        # print(f\"Exception occurred: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this setup:\n\n- If `sys.exit()` is called, the program will terminate with the specified exit code, and no traceback will be shown.\n- If an unhandled exception occurs, the traceback will be printed to the console, providing details about the error.\n\nBy structuring your code in this way, you can control when tracebacks are displayed and when they are not, based on whether an explicit exit is called or an actual exception is raised."
