        "content": "To permanently add a directory to the `PYTHONPATH`, you need to set the environment variable in your operating system. Here's how you can do it depending on your OS:\n\n### On Windows\n\n1. **Environment Variables through System Properties:**\n   - Right-click on 'This PC' or 'My Computer' on your desktop or in File Explorer.\n   - Select 'Properties'.\n   - Click on 'Advanced system settings' on the left.\n   - In the 'System Properties' window, go to the 'Advanced' tab and click on 'Environment Variables'.\n   - In the 'Environment Variables' window, under 'System variables', click 'New' to create a new environment variable.\n   - Set the 'Variable name' to `PYTHONPATH`.\n   - Set the 'Variable value' to the directory path you want to add. If you have multiple paths, separate them with semicolons `;`.\n\n2. **Using Command Prompt (temporary for session):**\n   - You can temporarily set the `PYTHONPATH` for a command prompt session by using:\n     ```cmd\n     set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\\path\\to\\your\\directory\n     ```\n\n### On macOS and Linux\n\n1. **Modify your shell's startup file:**\n   - Open a terminal.\n   - Depending on the shell you are using, open the corresponding configuration file in a text editor:\n     - `bash`: `nano ~/.bashrc` or `nano ~/.bash_profile`\n     - `zsh`: `nano ~/.zshrc`\n     - `fish`: `nano ~/.config/fish/config.fish`\n\n   - Add the following line to the file:\n     ```sh\n     export PYTHONPATH=\"$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/your/directory\"\n     ```\n\n   - Save the file and exit the editor.\n\n2. **Apply the changes:**\n   - Run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.bash_profile` or `source ~/.zshrc` to apply the changes immediately without restarting the terminal.\n\nThis will ensure that the directory is added to `PYTHONPATH` every time you open a new terminal session, making the changes permanent."
