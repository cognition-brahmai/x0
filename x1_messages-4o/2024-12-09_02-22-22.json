Even after running \"session.close()\" in my code, the session remains open until I exit Python. The only workaround I've found is to call \"engine.dispose()\" at the end. Based on this, I have two questions: Why is \"engine.dispose()\" necessary to close sessions? Doesn't \"session.close()\" suffice?\n\nHere is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\nfrom models import OneTable, get_engine\n\nengine = get_engine(database=\"mydb\")\nsession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)()\n\nresults = session.query(OneTable.company_name).all()\n\n# some work with the data #\n\nsession.close()\n```"

        "content": "In SQLAlchemy, understanding the distinction between `session.close()` and `engine.dispose()` is essential for managing database connections effectively.\n\n### `session.close()`\n\n1. **Purpose**: The `session.close()` method is used to close the session object. It releases the connection back to the connection pool managed by SQLAlchemy. However, it does not close the actual database connection; instead, it returns the connection to the pool so it can be reused.\n\n2. **Behavior**: After `session.close()`, the session will be in a \"closed\" state, and you won't be able to use it for further queries unless you reconfigure it. The underlying database connection remains open in the pool, ready to be borrowed by another session.\n\n### `engine.dispose()`\n\n1. **Purpose**: The `engine.dispose()` method closes all connections in the pool and disposes of the pool itself. This is a more drastic action than `session.close()`, as it effectively shuts down the entire connection pool, terminating all connections to the database.\n\n2. **Use Case**: This is typically used when you are done with the engine entirely and want to ensure that all associated resources are released, such as when the application is shutting down or you want to explicitly close all database connections.\n\n### Why `session.close()` May Not Seem Sufficient\n\n1. **Connection Pooling**: Since SQLAlchemy uses connection pooling by default, `session.close()` might not appear to close the session because it doesn't terminate the actual database connection; it just returns it to the pool.\n\n2. **Active Connections**: If you have other active sessions or processes using the same engine, the connection pool might keep connections open for reuse, and it could appear as though the session is still open.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n- **Session Lifecycle**: Use `session.close()` to end a session\u2019s use of a connection and return it to the pool. This is usually sufficient for most applications that rely on SQLAlchemy\u2019s connection pooling.\n\n- **Engine Disposal**: Use `engine.dispose()` only when you want to dispose of the engine entirely, such as before shutting down an application or when switching databases at runtime.\n\n- **Context Managers**: Consider using a context manager for sessions to ensure they are closed properly:\n\n  ```python\n  from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\n  from contextlib import contextmanager\n\n  @contextmanager\n  def session_scope():\n      session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)()\n      try:\n          yield session\n          session.commit()\n      except Exception:\n          session.rollback()\n          raise\n      finally:\n          session.close()\n\n  with session_scope() as session:\n      results = session.query(OneTable.company_name).all()\n      # some work with the data #\n  ```\n\nThis approach ensures that the session is closed automatically after the block of code is executed, even if an error occurs, without needing to manually call `session.close()`."
