I have designed my .ui files in Qt's Designer and have been able to change the \"windowIcon\" properties. However, this is not what I want. I want to change the application's icon in the windows taskbar, which currently shows the Python logo as a window icon. I found a related post on Stack Overflow but it didn't help me much. I also tried the following code, but the taskbar icon remains unchanged:\n\n```\napp = QtGui.QApplication([])\napp.setWindowIcon(QtGui.QIcon('chip_icon_normal.png'))\napp.exec_()\n```\nHow can I change the application's icon in the windows taskbar?"

        "content": "Changing the application's taskbar icon in PyQt4 can be a bit tricky, especially on Windows. The issue you are facing is likely because the `setWindowIcon` method needs to be called at the correct point in your application lifecycle, and also due to differences in how different platforms handle taskbar icons.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to help you set the taskbar icon correctly:\n\n1. **Ensure the Icon Path is Correct**: Make sure that the path to your icon file (`chip_icon_normal.png`) is correct and accessible from your application. It might be helpful to use an absolute path or ensure the icon file is in the same directory as your script.\n\n2. **Set the Icon on the Main Window**: If you have a main window (often a `QMainWindow`), you should set the icon directly on that window as well. This is because some platforms may use the main window's icon for the taskbar.\n\n3. **Use `QApplication` and `QMainWindow` Properly**: Here's an example that demonstrates how to set the icon:\n\n    ```python\n    from PyQt4 import QtGui\n    import sys\n\n    class MyWindow(QtGui.QMainWindow):\n        def __init__(self):\n            super(MyWindow, self).__init__()\n            self.setWindowTitle(\"My Application\")\n            self.setWindowIcon(QtGui.QIcon('chip_icon_normal.png'))  # Set icon for the main window\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        app = QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv)\n        app.setWindowIcon(QtGui.QIcon('chip_icon_normal.png'))  # Global app icon\n        window = MyWindow()\n        window.show()\n        sys.exit(app.exec_())\n    ```\n\n4. **Check Icon Format**: Make sure your icon file is in a format that is supported by Windows for taskbar icons, such as `.ico`. Converting your `.png` to `.ico` might help if the issue persists.\n\n5. **Build the Application Correctly**: If you are packaging your application using a tool like `py2exe` or `PyInstaller`, ensure that the icon is included in the build process. These tools have specific instructions for embedding icons in the executable.\n\n6. **Test on a Clean Environment**: Sometimes the taskbar might cache icons. Try testing your application on a different machine or after clearing the taskbar cache.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to set the taskbar icon for your PyQt4 application. If the issue persists, consider upgrading to PyQt5 or PyQt6, as they might offer better support for modern platforms."
