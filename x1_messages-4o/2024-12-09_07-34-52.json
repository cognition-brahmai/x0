My corpus has 5 classes of sentiments - very negative, negative, neutral, positive, and very positive, represented by numbers 1 through 5. I have used TfidfVectorizer for feature extraction and SVC for classification. However, I am unable to understand why my confusion matrix is \"diagonal\" and what the metrics - recall, precision, f1-score, and support imply for my data.\n\nHere is the code I used:\n\n```\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nimport numpy as np\ntfidf_vect= TfidfVectorizer(use_idf=True, smooth_idf=True, sublinear_tf=False, ngram_range=(2,2))\nfrom sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split, cross_val_score\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('/corpus.csv', header=0, sep=',', names=['id', 'content', 'label'])\n\nX = tfidf_vect.fit_transform(df['content'].values)\ny = df['label'].values\n\nfrom sklearn import cross_validation\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = cross_validation.train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.33)\n\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nsvm_1 = SVC(kernel='linear')\nsvm_1.fit(X, y)\nsvm_1_prediction = svm_1.predict(X_test)\n```\n\nHere is the code used to print the classification report and confusion matrix:\n\n```\nprint '\\nClassification report:\\n', classification_report(y_test, svm_1_prediction)\nprint '\\nConfusion matrix:\\n',confusion_matrix(y_test, svm_1_prediction)\n```\n\nAnd these are the results:\n\nClassification report:\n```\n             precision    recall  f1-score   support\n\n          1       1.00      0.76      0.86        71\n          2       1.00      0.84      0.91        43\n          3       1.00      0.74      0.85        89\n          4       0.98      0.95      0.96       288\n          5       0.87      1.00      0.93       367\n\navg / total       0.94      0.93      0.93       858\n```\n\nConfusion matrix:\n```\n[[ 54   0   0   0  17]\n [  0  36   0   1   6]\n [  0   0  66   5  18]\n [  0   0   0 273  15]\n [  0   0   0   0 367]]\n```"

        "content": "To interpret the results of your sentiment analysis task, let's break down the confusion matrix and the classification report:\n\n### Confusion Matrix\nThe confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class, while each column represents the instances in a predicted class. The diagonal elements (from top left to bottom right) represent the number of observations that were correctly classified. \n\nIn your confusion matrix:\n\n```\n[[ 54   0   0   0  17]\n [  0  36   0   1   6]\n [  0   0  66   5  18]\n [  0   0   0 273  15]\n [  0   0   0   0 367]]\n```\n\n- Class 1: 54 instances were correctly classified as 1, but 17 were incorrectly classified as 5.\n- Class 2: 36 instances were correctly classified as 2, but 1 was classified as 4, and 6 as 5.\n- Class 3: 66 were correctly classified as 3, 5 as 4, and 18 as 5.\n- Class 4: 273 were correctly classified as 4, and 15 as 5.\n- Class 5: All 367 instances were correctly classified as 5.\n\nThe fact that your matrix is mostly diagonal (with high numbers on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere) indicates a good performance of your model, as most instances are being classified correctly.\n\n### Classification Report\nThe classification report provides metrics such as precision, recall, f1-score, and support for each class.\n\n1. **Precision**: This metric indicates the accuracy of the positive predictions. It is the number of true positive results divided by the number of all positive results, including false positives. High precision for a class means that when the model predicts this class, it is usually correct.\n\n2. **Recall**: This is the ability of the model to find all relevant instances in the dataset. It is the number of true positive results divided by the number of actual positives (the sum of true positives and false negatives). High recall for a class means that the model is capturing most of the instances of that class.\n\n3. **F1-Score**: This is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a balance between precision and recall, especially useful when you have an uneven class distribution. A high f1-score indicates a good balance between precision and recall.\n\n4. **Support**: This is the number of actual occurrences of the class in the specified dataset. It is the number of true instances for each class.\n\n### Interpretation of Your Results\n\n- **Class 1**: Precision is 1.00, recall is 0.76, and f1-score is 0.86. This indicates perfect precision but some instances of class 1 are being missed (as recall is lower), meaning the model is very conservative in predicting class 1.\n  \n- **Class 2**: Precision is 1.00, recall is 0.84, and f1-score is 0.91. Similar to class 1, perfect precision but slightly more instances are being captured.\n\n- **Class 3**: Precision is 1.00, recall is 0.74, and f1-score is 0.85. This class has the lowest recall, suggesting the model is missing a significant number of instances for this class.\n\n- **Class 4**: Precision is 0.98, recall is 0.95, and f1-score is 0.96. This class has a very good balance between precision and recall.\n\n- **Class 5**: Precision is 0.87, recall is 1.00, and f1-score is 0.93. Here, recall is perfect, meaning all class 5 instances are being captured, but precision is slightly lower, indicating some misclassifications.\n\n**Overall**: The average precision, recall, and f1-score are all around 0.93, indicating a robust model with a good balance between precision and recall across classes, except for a few misclassifications. The model is performing generally well but could be improved in terms of recall for class 3, and precision for class 5. Consider tuning hyperparameters, employing different feature selection methods, or using more advanced models to improve these metrics."
