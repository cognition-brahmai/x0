        "content": "It seems like the issue you're encountering is due to attempting to install a version of TensorFlow that is not compatible with your current Python version. TensorFlow 0.12.0rc0 is specifically built for Python 3.5, which is why you're seeing the \"not a supported wheel\" error when trying to install it with Python 3.6.\n\nHere are a few steps you can take to resolve the issue and successfully install TensorFlow on your system:\n\n1. **Verify Python Version**: Ensure you're using a supported Python version for the TensorFlow version you want to install. As of now, it's best to use a stable release of Python 3.6 or higher for newer versions of TensorFlow.\n\n2. **Install a Compatible TensorFlow Version**: \n   - For Python 3.6 and above, TensorFlow 2.x is recommended. You can install it using:\n     ```bash\n     pip install tensorflow\n     ```\n\n3. **Upgrade pip**: Make sure you have the latest version of pip, setuptools, and wheel:\n   ```bash\n   python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel\n   ```\n\n4. **Check Compatibility**: If you need a specific version of TensorFlow that is not the latest, check the [TensorFlow compatibility table](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu) to ensure compatibility with your Python version.\n\n5. **Use Virtual Environments**: It's a good practice to use virtual environments to manage dependencies. You can create a virtual environment using:\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv myenv\n   ```\n   Activate it with:\n   ```bash\n   myenv\\Scripts\\activate\n   ```\n\n6. **Alternative Installation via Conda (if using Anaconda)**: If you're using Anaconda, you can install TensorFlow easily with:\n   ```bash\n   conda install tensorflow\n   ```\n\n7. **Check for System-Specific Issues**: Ensure your system architecture matches the wheel you are trying to install (e.g., 64-bit vs. 32-bit).\n\n8. **Try a Different Installation Source**: If you still encounter issues, you might want to try installing TensorFlow from the [official repository](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip) or using a pre-built binary from a trusted source.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the compatibility issues and successfully install TensorFlow on your Windows machine with Python 3.6 or later."
