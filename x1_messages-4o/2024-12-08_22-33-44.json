As you progress through the levels, you notice a pattern of colored blocks arranged in a diagonal formation. Each block is a different color than the one beside it and they intersect each other to create a criss-cross design. To advance to the next level, you must identify the mathematical sequence that describes the pattern of colored blocks. Can you crack the code and progress to the next level within the budget? Hint: The sequence is related to the Fibonacci sequence, but not exactly the same."

        "content": "To tackle this puzzle, let's first consider the properties of the Fibonacci sequence, which is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, often starting with 0 and 1. However, since the hint suggests the sequence is related but not identical to the Fibonacci sequence, we should consider variations or modifications of this sequence.\n\nOne potential modification could involve altering the starting values or applying a different operation to generate the sequence. For example, some variations involve multiplying by a constant, or adding an additional fixed number at each step.\n\nGiven these possibilities, let's hypothesize a sequence where each term is generated by a combination of preceding terms and a fixed modification. For instance, consider a sequence where each term is the sum of the two preceding terms plus an additional fixed number:\n\n1. Start with two initial values, say \\( a_1 = 1 \\) and \\( a_2 = 2 \\).\n2. For each subsequent term \\( a_n \\), define it as \\( a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + k \\), where \\( k \\) is a constant.\n\nThis sequence retains the additive property of Fibonacci but introduces a fixed increment. Set \\( k = 1 \\) as an example:\n\n- \\( a_3 = a_2 + a_1 + 1 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 \\)\n- \\( a_4 = a_3 + a_2 + 1 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \\)\n- \\( a_5 = a_4 + a_3 + 1 = 7 + 4 + 1 = 12 \\)\n\nContinue calculating terms until you recognize the pattern or the sequence matches the colored block pattern observed in the game. Adjust the starting values or the constant \\( k \\) if necessary to match the game's specific pattern.\n\nIf the sequence aligns with the pattern in the game, you can use it to predict the arrangement of the colored blocks and progress to the next level within your budget constraints."
