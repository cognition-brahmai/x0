However, when I attempt to do this using the command line interface with the following command: `C:\\SD\\stable-diffusion-main>python scripts/txt2img.py --prompt \"a close-up portrait of a cat by pablo picasso, vivid, abstract art, colorful, vibrant\" --plms --n_iter 3 --n_samples 1 --H 512 --W 512`, I encounter a memory error: `RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 1024.00 MiB (GPU 0; 8.00 GiB total capacity; 6.13 GiB already allocated; 0 bytes free; 6.73 GiB reserved in total by PyTorch) If reserved memory is >> allocated memory try setting max_split_size_mb to avoid fragmentation. See documentation for Memory Management and PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF`. Reducing the image size to 256 X 256 results in a successful execution but the image quality is significantly poorer. Why do I run out of memory at 6.13 GiB when I have 8 GiB on the card, and what does the GUI do differently to allow 512 by 512 output? Is there a setting I can change to reduce the load on the GPU?"

        "content": "When you're using Stable Diffusion via the command line and encounter a CUDA out-of-memory error, it's typically due to the way memory is allocated and managed by PyTorch. Here are some reasons why this might happen and potential solutions:\n\n1. **Memory Fragmentation**: \n   - PyTorch sometimes reserves more memory than it actually needs, leading to fragmentation. This can cause issues when trying to allocate more memory for additional processes. The error message hints at this by recommending the `max_split_size_mb` configuration.\n   - You can try setting the environment variable `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF` to `max_split_size_mb:128` or another appropriate value. This setting helps manage memory fragmentation. You can set this variable in your command line before running the script:\n     ```bash\n     set PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=max_split_size_mb:128\n     ```\n\n2. **Batch Size**:\n   - The `--n_iter` and `--n_samples` parameters control the number of iterations and samples per iteration. In your command, `--n_iter 3` means you're generating three images in sequence, but you might want to try reducing `--n_samples` to see if this alleviates memory usage. You can experiment with different combinations.\n\n3. **Model Precision**:\n   - Try using mixed precision to reduce memory usage. This can be done by using the `--precision` flag if it's available in your script, or by enabling AMP (Automatic Mixed Precision) if supported. You might need to modify the script to support this if it's not available directly through a command-line flag.\n\n4. **Model Optimization**:\n   - Check if the GUI version of Stable Diffusion you're using implements any optimizations such as gradient checkpointing, model pruning, or other techniques that reduce GPU memory usage. These might not be present in the command-line script by default.\n\n5. **VRAM Usage**:\n   - Ensure that no other processes are using VRAM. Close any other applications that may be using the GPU, like web browsers or other GPU-accelerated applications.\n\n6. **Different Libraries or Versions**:\n   - The GUI might be using a different version of PyTorch or other libraries that are more memory-efficient. Ensure that both environments (GUI and CLI) are using the same library versions for consistency.\n\nBy adjusting these settings and configurations, you should be able to reduce the GPU memory load and generate 512x512 images without running into memory errors."
