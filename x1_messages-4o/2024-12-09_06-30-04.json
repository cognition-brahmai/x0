How can I resolve this issue? Here's the code I am working with:\n\n```python\nm1 = pygame.image.load(dict[1])\nm2 = pygame.image.load(dict[2])\nm3 = pygame.image.load(dict[3])\ndict = {1: \"walk1.png\", 2: \"walk2.png\", 3: \"walk3.png\"}\nplayerxy = (375,130)\nwindow.blit(m1, (playerxy))\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"TypeError: 'type' object is not subscriptable,\" typically occurs when you try to use indexing on a type object rather than an instance of that type. In your code, the issue arises because you're using the name `dict` for your dictionary, which conflicts with the built-in `dict` type in Python. When you try to access `dict[1]`, Python interprets `dict` as the built-in type rather than your dictionary instance.\n\nTo fix this, you should rename your dictionary to avoid using the name `dict`. Here's a revised version of your code:\n\n```python\n# Rename the dictionary to avoid conflict with the built-in dict type\nimage_dict = {1: \"walk1.png\", 2: \"walk2.png\", 3: \"walk3.png\"}\n\nm1 = pygame.image.load(image_dict[1])\nm2 = pygame.image.load(image_dict[2])\nm3 = pygame.image.load(image_dict[3])\n\nplayerxy = (375, 130)\nwindow.blit(m1, playerxy)\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, `image_dict` is used as the variable name for your dictionary. This should resolve the TypeError you're encountering. Also, make sure that your Pygame window is properly initialized and that you're calling `pygame.display.update()` or `pygame.display.flip()` after `window.blit()` to update the display with the loaded images."
