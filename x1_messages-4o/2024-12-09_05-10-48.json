However, I am unable to install these dependencies system-wide currently and have installed them in a non-standard location. How do I instruct pip to locate these dependencies? Specifically, how can I convey the include directories (gcc -I) and library directories (gcc -L -l) to be used when building the pyodbc extension through pip?"

        "content": "When installing a Python package like `pyodbc` that depends on non-Python libraries, and those libraries are installed in non-standard locations, you need to provide the necessary include and library paths to the build process. You can achieve this by setting environment variables that the underlying build tools (such as `gcc`) will use. Here is how you can do it:\n\n1. **Set the `CFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` environment variables**:\n   - `CFLAGS` is used to specify the include directories.\n   - `LDFLAGS` is used to specify the library directories and libraries to link against.\n\n2. **Use `pip` to install `pyodbc` with these environment variables set**.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how you can do this in a terminal:\n\n```bash\nexport CFLAGS=\"-I/path/to/unixodbc/include\"\nexport LDFLAGS=\"-L/path/to/unixodbc/lib -lodbc\"\n\npip install pyodbc\n```\n\nReplace `/path/to/unixodbc/include` and `/path/to/unixodbc/lib` with the actual paths where you have installed `unixodbc` headers and libraries.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Locate the non-standard installation paths**:\n   - Find where the headers (`odbc.h`, etc.) are located, usually something like `/opt/unixodbc/include`.\n   - Find where the libraries (`libodbc.so`, etc.) are located, usually something like `/opt/unixodbc/lib`.\n\n2. **Set the environment variables**:\n   - `CFLAGS` should point to the directory containing the headers.\n   - `LDFLAGS` should point to the directory containing the libraries and include the `-l` option for linking.\n\n3. **Install `pyodbc`**:\n   - Run the `pip install` command with the environment variables set as shown above.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- If you are using a virtual environment, ensure it is activated before you run the `pip install` command.\n- If you encounter any issues, you can use `pip install --no-cache-dir pyodbc` to force a fresh build and avoid cached builds that may not recognize the new paths.\n- If you need to specify additional linker flags, you can add them to `LDFLAGS`. For example, if you need to link against additional libraries, include them like `-lotherlib`.\n\nBy setting these environment variables, you instruct the build process to use your custom installation paths for the necessary libraries and headers."
