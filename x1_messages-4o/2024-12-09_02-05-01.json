I am trying to join '/home/build/test/sandboxes/', a variable named 'todaystr', and '/new_sandbox/' to form a complete path. However, when I debug my code, it appears that only the '/new_sandbox/' part of the path is being stored. Here is my code: \n```python\nos.path.join('/home/build/test/sandboxes/', todaystr, '/new_sandbox/')\n```\nWhy isn't os.path.join() working as expected in this case?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with `os.path.join()` is due to the fact that any component of the path that starts with a forward slash (`/`) is considered an absolute path, and all preceding components are discarded. This is why only the `'/new_sandbox/'` part is being stored, as it starts with a `/`.\n\nTo fix this, you should remove the leading slash from the `'/new_sandbox/'` component so that it is treated as a relative path instead of an absolute path. Here is the corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Assuming todaystr is defined somewhere in your code\n# todaystr = '2023-10-25'\n\ncomplete_path = os.path.join('/home/build/test/sandboxes/', todaystr, 'new_sandbox/')\nprint(complete_path)\n```\n\nMake sure that `todaystr` is defined and holds the correct string value representing the date or whatever value you need to include in the path. The corrected code will join the paths correctly and output the desired complete path."
