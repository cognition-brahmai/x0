However, when I try to use `setattr(p,'pet.name','Sparky')` and `setattr(p,'residence.type','Apartment')` to set the attributes, instead of setting the `name` attribute on the `Pet` subobject of the `Person`, a new attribute `pet.name` is created on the `Person`. I can't specify `person.pet` to `setattr()` because different sub-objects will be set by the same method. Is there an easy/builtin way to accomplish this? Or do I need to write a recursive function to parse the string and call `getattr()` multiple times until the necessary subobject is found and then call `setattr()` on that found subobject?"

        "content": "In Python, `setattr()` does not natively support setting attributes on nested objects using a single string with dot notation. Therefore, you'll need to implement a custom solution to dynamically set attributes on nested objects. Here's a way to do it using a helper function:\n\n```python\ndef set_nested_attr(obj, attr_path, value):\n    # Split the attribute path by dots\n    attrs = attr_path.split('.')\n    # Traverse through the object's attributes using the path\n    for attr in attrs[:-1]:\n        obj = getattr(obj, attr)\n    # Set the final attribute to the given value\n    setattr(obj, attrs[-1], value)\n\n# Example usage\nclass Pet:\n    def __init__(self, name=None):\n        self.name = name\n\nclass Residence:\n    def __init__(self, type=None):\n        self.type = type\n\nclass Person:\n    def __init__(self, pet=None, residence=None):\n        self.pet = pet\n        self.residence = residence\n\n# Create instances\nmy_pet = Pet()\nmy_residence = Residence()\nperson = Person(pet=my_pet, residence=my_residence)\n\n# Set nested attributes\nset_nested_attr(person, 'pet.name', 'Sparky')\nset_nested_attr(person, 'residence.type', 'Apartment')\n\n# Verify results\nprint(person.pet.name)  # Output: Sparky\nprint(person.residence.type)  # Output: Apartment\n```\n\nThis `set_nested_attr` function splits the attribute path into its components, traverses the object's attributes to find the target object, and then sets the specified attribute on that object. This approach avoids the need for a more complex recursive function and efficiently uses Python's `getattr()` and `setattr()` functions."
