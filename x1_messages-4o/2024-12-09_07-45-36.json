Specifically, I have a block of code where I call pdb.set_trace() before a loop that iterates over a range of five values and prints each value. I want pdb to pause execution before the loop, continue execution until the loop finishes, and then pause again before the next line of code (print('Done!')) is executed. How can I achieve this?\n\nFor example, my code looks like this:\n\n```python\npdb.set_trace()\nfor i in range(5):\n     print(i)\n\nprint('Done!')\n```"

        "content": "To use the Python Debugger (`pdb`) to skip over a loop and pause execution before the next line of code, you can utilize breakpoints and the `continue` command. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. Set a breakpoint at the line where you want to pause after the loop finishes.\n2. Use the `continue` command to execute the loop without stepping through each iteration.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. Start your script and let it hit the `pdb.set_trace()` line. The debugger will pause, and you'll see the `(Pdb)` prompt.\n\n2. Once at the `(Pdb)` prompt, set a breakpoint at the line after the loop where `print('Done!')` is located. You can do this by using the `b` command followed by the line number of `print('Done!')`. For example, if `print('Done!')` is on line 5, you would type:\n\n   ```\n   (Pdb) b 5\n   ```\n\n3. Use the `continue` command to resume execution. The debugger will run the loop and pause again at the breakpoint you set:\n\n   ```\n   (Pdb) c\n   ```\n\nHere's a complete example of how you would do it in your script:\n\n```python\nimport pdb\n\npdb.set_trace()\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(i)\n\nprint('Done!')\n```\n\nWhen you run this script, follow these steps:\n\n1. At the `(Pdb)` prompt, set a breakpoint at the `print('Done!')` line:\n\n   ```\n   (Pdb) b 5\n   ```\n\n2. Continue execution:\n\n   ```\n   (Pdb) c\n   ```\n\nThe debugger will skip over the loop and pause right before executing `print('Done!')`. This allows you to continue debugging from that point onward."
