I create a dictionary with my object as the key:\n\n```python\npackage_disseminators = {\n  ContentType(\"application\", \"zip\", \"http://other/property\") : \"one\",\n  ContentType(\"application\", \"zip\") : \"two\"\n}\n```\n\nThen create another object that is the same as one which is a key:\n\n```python\ncontent_type = ContentType(\"application\", \"zip\", \"http://other/property\")\n```\n\nI have given the ContentType object custom `__eq__` and `__str__` methods, such that the `__eq__` method compares the `__str__` values. When I check if my object is a key using `content_type in package_disseminators.keys()`, it returns `True`. However, when I try to access the dictionary value using that key `package_disseminators[content_type]`, I get a KeyError. Also, `package_disseminators.has_key(content_type)` returns `False`. I'm guessing that the comparison process that Python uses to determine equality differs between a straight \"in\" statement on a list and actually looking up a key in a dictionary. Could you offer any guidance or insights?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely due to the fact that the `__eq__` method is not the only method that needs to be defined for an object to be used as a key in a dictionary. In Python, dictionary keys must be hashable, which means that the object must have a consistent hash value derived from its contents. This is accomplished by implementing the `__hash__` method in addition to `__eq__`.\n\nWhen you use `content_type in package_disseminators.keys()`, Python is performing an equality check using the `__eq__` method. However, when you try to access the dictionary value using `package_disseminators[content_type]`, Python uses the `__hash__` method to find the bucket where the entry is stored, and then it uses `__eq__` to check for equality.\n\nHere's how you can define the `ContentType` class to ensure that it can be used as a key in a dictionary:\n\n```python\nclass ContentType:\n    def __init__(self, main_type, sub_type, parameter=None):\n        self.main_type = main_type\n        self.sub_type = sub_type\n        self.parameter = parameter\n\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        if isinstance(other, ContentType):\n            return (self.main_type, self.sub_type, self.parameter) == (other.main_type, other.sub_type, other.parameter)\n        return False\n\n    def __hash__(self):\n        return hash((self.main_type, self.sub_type, self.parameter))\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"{self.main_type}/{self.sub_type}\" + (f\"; {self.parameter}\" if self.parameter else \"\")\n\n# Example usage\npackage_disseminators = {\n    ContentType(\"application\", \"zip\", \"http://other/property\"): \"one\",\n    ContentType(\"application\", \"zip\"): \"two\"\n}\n\ncontent_type = ContentType(\"application\", \"zip\", \"http://other/property\")\n\nprint(content_type in package_disseminators)  # True\nprint(package_disseminators[content_type])    # \"one\"\n```\n\nBy implementing the `__hash__` method, you ensure that the object can be correctly used as a dictionary key. The hash value should be consistent with the fields used in `__eq__` so that objects considered equal have the same hash value."
