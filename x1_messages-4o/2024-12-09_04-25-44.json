I have a large plain text file and I want to split it into smaller files, each containing a certain number of lines. For instance, if my file has around 2 million lines, I'd like to split it into 10 files that contain 200k lines, or into 100 files that contain 20k lines. I am not concerned about the file being evenly divisible."

        "content": "To split a large text file into smaller files with an equal number of lines using Bash and Unix utilities, you can use the `split` command. This command is specifically designed for this purpose and provides a simple way to achieve your goal.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using `split` with a specified number of lines**:\n\n   If you want to split the file into smaller files with a specific number of lines, you can use the `-l` option with the `split` command. For example, to split the file into smaller files each containing 200,000 lines, you can execute:\n\n   ```bash\n   split -l 200000 largefile.txt prefix_\n   ```\n\n   In this command:\n   - `-l 200000` indicates that each output file should contain 200,000 lines.\n   - `largefile.txt` is your original large file.\n   - `prefix_` is the prefix for the output files. The split command will append a suffix like `aa`, `ab`, etc., to this prefix to create the output file names (e.g., `prefix_aa`, `prefix_ab`, etc.).\n\n2. **Specifying file size instead of line count**:\n\n   If you want to split the file into a specific number of output files rather than specifying the number of lines per file, you can first determine the total number of lines in your file, calculate the number of lines per file, and then use the `split` command with the calculated line count.\n\n   For example, if you have approximately 2 million lines and want to create 10 files:\n\n   ```bash\n   # Calculate lines per file\n   lines_per_file=$((2000000 / 10))\n\n   # Use split with calculated lines per file\n   split -l $lines_per_file largefile.txt prefix_\n   ```\n\n3. **Handling remainder lines**:\n\n   If the number of lines in your file is not perfectly divisible by the number of desired output files, the `split` command will handle the remainder lines by including them in the last output file.\n\nThis approach should effectively split your large text file into smaller files with an approximately equal number of lines. Adjust the `-l` option as needed based on your specific requirements."
