        "content": "The error you're encountering is likely because the `find(text=\"Address:\")` is not being found as expected. The text \"Address:\" is within a `<b>` tag, so you need to adjust your approach slightly to ensure you're targeting the correct element. Here's how you can extract \"My home address\" using BeautifulSoup:\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\nhtml_content = \"\"\"\n<td><b>Address:</b></td>\n<td>My home address</td>\n\"\"\"\n\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')\n\n# Find the <b> tag containing \"Address:\"\naddress_label = soup.find('b', text='Address:')\n\nif address_label:\n    # Get the parent <td> of the <b> tag\n    parent_td = address_label.find_parent('td')\n    \n    # Find the next sibling <td> and get its text\n    address_value = parent_td.find_next_sibling('td').text\n    print(address_value)\nelse:\n    print(\"Address label not found.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Find the `<b>` Tag**: We first locate the `<b>` tag that contains the text \"Address:\".\n\n2. **Navigate to Parent `<td>`**: Once we have the `<b>` tag, we can find its parent `<td>` element.\n\n3. **Find the Next Sibling `<td>`**: We then find the next sibling `<td>` of the parent `<td>` to get the actual address content.\n\n4. **Extract Text**: Finally, we extract the text from the sibling `<td>`, which is \"My home address\". \n\nThis approach will help you extract the desired text without encountering an `AttributeError`."
