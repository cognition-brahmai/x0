        "content": "I want to calculate a new latitude/longitude point given an existing point in lat/long, a distance (in KM), and a bearing (in degrees converted to radians). I have been using the formulas from a specific website, but I can't seem to get them to work properly for me. The formulas are:\n\n```\nlat2 = asin(sin(lat1)*cos(d/R) + cos(lat1)*sin(d/R)*cos(\u03b8))\nlon2 = lon1 + atan2(sin(\u03b8)*sin(d/R)*cos(lat1), cos(d/R)\u2212sin(lat1)*sin(lat2))\n```\n\nIn these formulas, `asin` is the arc sine function, `d` is the distance (in any unit), `R` is the radius of the earth (in the same unit as `d`), `atan2(a,b)` is the arc tangent of `b/a`, and `\u03b8` is the bearing (in radians, clockwise from north). When I use these formulas in my Python code, I get `lat2 = 0.472492248844` and `lon2 = 79.4821662373`, but the results I'm hoping for are `lat2 = 52.20444` and `lon2 = 0.36056`. What could be the issue here?"

        "content": "Let's go through the potential issues step-by-step to ensure everything is set up correctly.\n\n1. **Unit Consistency**: Ensure that the units for distance `d` and the Earth's radius `R` are consistent. If `d` is in kilometers, `R` must also be in kilometers.\n\n2. **Radians vs Degrees**: Make sure that all angular measurements are in radians when using trigonometric functions:\n   - Convert latitude and longitude from degrees to radians before applying the formula.\n   - Convert the final results back to degrees if necessary.\n\n3. **Earth's Radius**: Use the correct value for the Earth's radius. The average radius of the Earth is approximately 6,371 kilometers.\n\n4. **Python Implementation**: Check the Python implementation for correct use of trigonometric functions and conversions. Here's a sample code snippet:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_new_position(lat1, lon1, d, theta):\n    # Convert latitude and longitude from degrees to radians\n    lat1 = math.radians(lat1)\n    lon1 = math.radians(lon1)\n    \n    # Earth's radius in kilometers\n    R = 6371.0\n    \n    # Calculate new latitude\n    lat2 = math.asin(math.sin(lat1) * math.cos(d / R) +\n                     math.cos(lat1) * math.sin(d / R) * math.cos(theta))\n    \n    # Calculate new longitude\n    lon2 = lon1 + math.atan2(math.sin(theta) * math.sin(d / R) * math.cos(lat1),\n                             math.cos(d / R) - math.sin(lat1) * math.sin(lat2))\n    \n    # Convert the new latitude and longitude from radians to degrees\n    lat2 = math.degrees(lat2)\n    lon2 = math.degrees(lon2)\n    \n    return lat2, lon2\n\n# Example usage:\nlat1 = 52.20444  # Initial latitude in degrees\nlon1 = 0.36056   # Initial longitude in degrees\nd = 100          # Distance in kilometers\ntheta = math.radians(45)  # Bearing in radians\n\nlat2, lon2 = calculate_new_position(lat1, lon1, d, theta)\n\nprint(f\"New Latitude: {lat2}\")\nprint(f\"New Longitude: {lon2}\")\n```\n\n5. **Check Input Values**: Verify that the input values used in the function are as expected. Small errors in input values can lead to significant discrepancies.\n\n6. **Bearing Angle**: Ensure that the bearing angle is correctly converted to radians. The function `math.radians()` can be used to convert degrees to radians.\n\nBy following these guidelines and using the code snippet above, you should be able to achieve the correct output. If you still face issues, double-check your input values and the conversion steps."
