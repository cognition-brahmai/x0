I understand that the `__add__` method can be used to override the `+` operator, but this method doesn't seem to work properly for `+=`. If I use `__add__` to mutate `self`, using `z = x + y` ends up mutating `x`, which is not the intended behavior. On the other hand, if `__add__` returns a new object, executing the following sequence of operations:\n\n```python\ntmp = z\nz += x\nz += y\ntmp += w\nreturn z\n```\n\nreturns a value without `w`, as `z` and `tmp` start pointing to different objects after `z += x` is executed. I could use an `append()` method, but I would prefer to overload `+=` if possible. Is there a way to do this?"

        "content": "To properly overload the `+=` operator in Python, you need to implement the `__iadd__` method in your class. The `__iadd__` method is specifically designed to handle the `+=` operation (in-place addition). This method allows you to mutate the object itself (if that's desired) rather than creating a new object, which is what `__add__` would do.\n\nHere's a simple example of how you can implement `__iadd__`:\n\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.value = value\n\n    def __add__(self, other):\n        # This should return a new object\n        return MyClass(self.value + other.value)\n\n    def __iadd__(self, other):\n        # This should modify self in-place and return self\n        self.value += other.value\n        return self\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"MyClass({self.value})\"\n\n# Example usage:\nx = MyClass(10)\ny = MyClass(5)\nz = MyClass(2)\n\nz += x  # This will call __iadd__ and modify z in-place\nprint(z)  # Output: MyClass(12)\n\ntmp = z\ntmp += y  # This again modifies tmp (and z, since tmp is a reference to z)\nprint(tmp)  # Output: MyClass(17)\nprint(z)    # Output: MyClass(17), since tmp and z are the same object\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- `__add__` creates and returns a new instance of `MyClass`, which is what happens when you use `+`.\n- `__iadd__` modifies the current instance (`self`) and returns it. This is the correct behavior for `+=`.\n\nWith this implementation, using `+=` will correctly modify the object in place, and you won't run into the issue of `z` and `tmp` pointing to different objects after the operation."
