I am now attempting to convert this single form into a formset using Django's formsets.formset_factory method. However, I am struggling to find a way to pass the 'affiliate' information to each individual form when creating the formset. I have tried creating the formset as follows:\n\n```python\nServiceFormSet = forms.formsets.formset_factory(ServiceForm, extra=3)\nformset = ServiceFormSet()\n```\n\nBut, I don't know how to pass the 'affiliate' information (which is the logged in user) to each form in the formset. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To pass custom information such as the `affiliate` to each form in a formset, you need to customize the formset's initialization process. You can achieve this by creating a custom formset class and overriding the `__init__` method to pass the `affiliate` to each form. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Create a Custom Formset Class**: Subclass the `BaseFormSet` and override the `__init__` method to include the `affiliate` parameter.\n\n2. **Override the `__init__` Method**: In the overridden `__init__` method, loop through each form in the formset and set the `affiliate` for each form.\n\n3. **Use the Custom Formset Class**: Use this custom formset class in the `formset_factory`.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom django import forms\nfrom django.forms import formset_factory, BaseFormSet\n\nclass ServiceForm(forms.Form):\n    # Your form fields here\n    affiliate = forms.CharField()\n\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        affiliate = kwargs.pop('affiliate', None)\n        super(ServiceForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n        self.fields['affiliate'].initial = affiliate\n\nclass BaseServiceFormSet(BaseFormSet):\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        self.affiliate = kwargs.pop('affiliate', None)\n        super(BaseServiceFormSet, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n        for form in self.forms:\n            form.__init__(*args, affiliate=self.affiliate, **kwargs)\n\nServiceFormSet = formset_factory(ServiceForm, formset=BaseServiceFormSet, extra=3)\n\n# Usage\naffiliate = 'YourAffiliateValue'  # This should be the logged-in user or any other value you want to pass\nformset = ServiceFormSet(affiliate=affiliate)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Custom Formset Class**: By creating a custom formset class (`BaseServiceFormSet`), you can control the initialization of each form in the formset.\n\n- **Passing Parameters**: The `__init__` method of the formset is modified to accept additional parameters (like `affiliate`), and these are passed to each form.\n\n- **Initialization of Each Form**: Each form in the formset is initialized with the custom parameters in the loop within the `__init__` method.\n\nWith this setup, you can ensure that each form in the formset receives the `affiliate` parameter correctly."
