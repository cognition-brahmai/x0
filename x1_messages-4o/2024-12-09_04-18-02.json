I have performed PCA using the following code where X_train contains 279180 rows and 104 columns:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\npca = PCA(n_components=30)\nX_train_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_train)\n```\n\nWhen I want to project the eigenvectors onto the feature space, I have tried the following:\n\n```python\n\"\"\" Projection \"\"\"\ncomp = pca.components_ #30x104\ncom_tr = np.transpose(pca.components_) #104x30\nproj = np.dot(X_train,com_tr) #279180x104 * 104x30 = 297180x30\n```\n\nHowever, I am not sure if this is correct since Scikit's documentation states that components_ is an array [n_components, n_features] and represents the principal axes in feature space, which are the directions of maximum variance in the data. It seems like this might already be projected, but when I checked the source code, it returns only the eigenvectors. What is the right way to project it? \n\nFurthermore, I am aiming to calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of reconstruction using the following code:\n\n```python\n\"\"\" Reconstruct \"\"\"\nrecon = np.dot(proj,comp) #297180x30 * 30x104 = 279180x104\n\n\"\"\"  MSE Error \"\"\"\nprint \"MSE = %.6G\" %(np.mean((X_train - recon)**2))\n```"

        "content": "To correctly perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and project eigenvectors onto the feature space in Scikit-learn, you need to understand how PCA works and how to reconstruct the original data from the reduced components. Let's go through the steps to ensure your implementation is correct.\n\n### PCA Transformation and Projection\n\n1. **Fit and Transform with PCA**:\n   You've already performed this step correctly. You've reduced the dimensionality of your data to 30 components.\n\n   ```python\n   from sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n   pca = PCA(n_components=30)\n   X_train_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_train)\n   ```\n\n2. **Projection of Data**:\n   After fitting PCA, `pca.components_` provides the principal axes in the feature space. These are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, representing the directions of maximum variance.\n\n   The line `proj = np.dot(X_train, com_tr)` is actually unnecessary if your goal is to just use the dimensionality-reduced data. `X_train_pca` is already the projected data in the new feature space.\n\n   If you want to manually compute the projection using the components, it should be:\n   ```python\n   proj = np.dot(X_train - X_train.mean(axis=0), pca.components_.T)\n   ```\n\n   But since you have already used `fit_transform`, `X_train_pca` is the projected data.\n\n### Reconstruction and MSE Calculation\n\nTo reconstruct the original data from the PCA-transformed data:\n\n3. **Reconstruct the Original Data**:\n   To reconstruct the data, you multiply the reduced data by the transpose of the components and add back the mean that was subtracted during centering.\n\n   ```python\n   X_train_reconstructed = np.dot(X_train_pca, pca.components_) + X_train.mean(axis=0)\n   ```\n\n4. **Calculate MSE**:\n   Now, you can calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the original data and the reconstructed data:\n\n   ```python\n   mse = np.mean((X_train - X_train_reconstructed) ** 2)\n   print(f\"MSE = {mse:.6G}\")\n   ```\n\n### Key Points to Remember\n\n- **Data Centering**: PCA assumes that the data is centered. Scikit-learn's PCA automatically centers the data, but remember to add back the mean when reconstructing.\n- **Reconstruction**: Use the transformed data directly with the components to reconstruct the original feature space.\n- **MSE**: This measures how well you can recreate the original data from the reduced representation.\n\nBy following these steps, you ensure that your PCA implementation and evaluation are correctly set up."
