Would the solution involve an `np.ndarray` subclass?"

        "content": "In NumPy, the concept of creating a view when concatenating arrays is not straightforward because concatenation inherently involves creating a new array structure that combines the elements of the input arrays. This process typically requires copying data to organize it into a single contiguous block of memory, which is why functions like `np.append` and `np.concatenate` create copies of the input arrays.\n\nHowever, you can try using some advanced techniques, like using `np.lib.stride_tricks`, to create a view-like behavior by manipulating strides, but this method is complex and not recommended for general use as it can result in unpredictable behavior or errors if not handled correctly.\n\nAnother approach is to use Python's built-in data structures, such as lists, to maintain references to the original arrays and access them in a concatenated manner without copying:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nX = np.array([[1, 2, 3]])\nY = np.array([[-1, -2, -3], [4, 5, 6]])\n\n# Create a list of references to the arrays\narrays = [X, Y]\n\n# Access elements like a concatenated array\ndef get_element(arrays, i, j):\n    for array in arrays:\n        if i < array.shape[0]:\n            return array[i, j]\n        i -= array.shape[0]\n    raise IndexError(\"Index out of range\")\n\n# Example usage\nprint(get_element(arrays, 0, 1))  # Accessing the element at (0, 1) of the virtual concatenated array\n```\n\nThis method uses a function to access elements as if they were part of a single concatenated array, without actually creating a new array. However, it's not as efficient as using actual NumPy arrays for operations.\n\nIf you need to perform operations on the concatenated array, using `np.concatenate` or `np.append` with the knowledge that they will create copies is typically the best approach. If memory usage is a concern and the arrays are large, consider strategies to minimize the need for such concatenations, like processing the arrays separately or using memory-mapped files with `np.memmap` for large datasets."
