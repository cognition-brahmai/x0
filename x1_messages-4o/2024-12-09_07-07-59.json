I've come across a syntax where two variable values are swapped as follows: \n\n```python\nleft, right = right, left\n```\nI'm curious if this is the standard way to perform this operation, or if there's another method that's more commonly used."

        "content": "Yes, the syntax you mentioned is indeed the standard and most idiomatic way to swap the values of two variables in Python. The line:\n\n```python\nleft, right = right, left\n```\n\ntakes advantage of Python's ability to perform tuple packing and unpacking in a single statement. This method is favored because it is both concise and clear, making the code easy to read and understand. It directly swaps the values without the need for a temporary variable, which is often required in other programming languages.\n\nWhile there are other ways to swap values, such as using a temporary variable:\n\n```python\ntemp = left\nleft = right\nright = temp\n```\n\nor arithmetic operations (only if the variables are numbers):\n\n```python\nleft = left + right\nright = left - right\nleft = left - right\n```\n\nor bitwise XOR (again, only if the variables are integers):\n\n```python\nleft = left ^ right\nright = left ^ right\nleft = left ^ right\n```\n\nthese methods are generally considered less Pythonic and can be less readable and more error-prone. Hence, the tuple unpacking method is the conventional and preferred way in Python."
