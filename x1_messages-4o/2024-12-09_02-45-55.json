Suppose we have a numpy.array where each row is a vector and a single numpy.array. Is it possible to calculate the Euclidean distance between all the points and this single point, and store them in one numpy.array? Is there a procedure that can be used for this purpose, or is there a single command that can be used to compare the single point with a list of other points, ultimately resulting in a matrix of distances?\n\nHere is an interface for reference:\n\n```python\npoints #2d list of row-vectors\nsinglePoint #one row-vector\n\nlistOfDistances= procedure( points,singlePoint)\n```"

        "content": "To calculate the Euclidean distance between each row vector in a 2D numpy array (`points`) and a single row vector (`singlePoint`), you can efficiently use numpy's broadcasting capabilities. Here is a procedure that demonstrates how to do this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_distances(points, singlePoint):\n    # Ensure points and singlePoint are numpy arrays\n    points = np.array(points)\n    singlePoint = np.array(singlePoint)\n    \n    # Calculate the difference between each point and the single point\n    differences = points - singlePoint\n    \n    # Calculate the squared differences and sum them along axis 1\n    squared_distances = np.sum(differences ** 2, axis=1)\n    \n    # Take the square root of the squared distances to get the Euclidean distances\n    euclidean_distances = np.sqrt(squared_distances)\n    \n    return euclidean_distances\n\n# Example usage:\npoints = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])\nsinglePoint = np.array([1, 1])\n\nlistOfDistances = calculate_distances(points, singlePoint)\nprint(listOfDistances)\n```\n\nThis function works by:\n1. Subtracting the `singlePoint` from each row in `points` using broadcasting.\n2. Squaring the differences and summing them to get the squared Euclidean distance for each point.\n3. Taking the square root of the result to obtain the Euclidean distance.\n\nThe result is a 1D numpy array (`listOfDistances`) where each entry corresponds to the Euclidean distance from the corresponding row vector in `points` to `singlePoint`."
