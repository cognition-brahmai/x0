The string field is unique and hence, used as the key of the dictionary. I am able to sort the dictionary based on the keys, but I am struggling to sort it based on the values. Is there a simpler solution to sort the dictionary either in ascending or descending order?"

        "content": "To sort a dictionary by its values, you can use Python's built-in capabilities. Since dictionary values in your case are numeric, you can easily sort them using the `sorted()` function along with a lambda function to specify that you want to sort by values. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Sorting in Ascending Order\n\n```python\n# Example dictionary\nmy_dict = {\n    \"key1\": 10,\n    \"key2\": 5,\n    \"key3\": 15\n}\n\n# Sort dictionary by values in ascending order\nsorted_dict_asc = dict(sorted(my_dict.items(), key=lambda item: item[1]))\n\nprint(\"Ascending Order:\", sorted_dict_asc)\n```\n\n### Sorting in Descending Order\n\n```python\n# Sort dictionary by values in descending order\nsorted_dict_desc = dict(sorted(my_dict.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True))\n\nprint(\"Descending Order:\", sorted_dict_desc)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- `my_dict.items()` returns a view of the dictionary's items (key-value pairs).\n- `sorted()` is used to sort these items.\n- `key=lambda item: item[1]` tells `sorted()` to use the value (second item in the key-value pair) for sorting.\n- `reverse=True` sorts the values in descending order, while omitting it will sort in ascending order.\n- `dict()` is used to convert the sorted list of tuples back into a dictionary.\n\nThis approach will give you a new dictionary sorted by its values, either in ascending or descending order as per your requirement."
