For instance, I have a generator function `gimme()` which yields values from 0 to 9. However, when I try to create a numpy array using `numpy.array(gimme())`, it only stores the generator object itself and does not iterate over the generator. The desired behavior is that of `numpy.array(list(gimme()))`, but it creates an intermediate list in memory. Is there a more memory-efficient way to accomplish this?\n\n```python\nimport numpy\ndef gimme():\n  for x in xrange(10):\n    yield x\n\ngimme() \n# <generator object at 0x28a1758>\n\nlist(gimme()) \n# [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n\nnumpy.array(xrange(10)) \n# array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])\n\nnumpy.array(gimme()) \n# array(<generator object at 0x28a1758>, dtype=object)\n\nnumpy.array(list(gimme())) \n# array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])\n```"

        "content": "To build a NumPy array from a generator without creating a full intermediate list, you can use a more memory-efficient approach by directly iterating over the generator and constructing the array in a more incremental fashion. Here's one way to achieve this:\n\n1. Use `numpy.fromiter()` to create a NumPy array from an iterable (such as a generator). This method is designed for this purpose and allows you to specify the data type and optionally the count of elements, which helps in avoiding intermediate lists.\n\nHere's how you can use `numpy.fromiter()` with your `gimme()` generator:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef gimme():\n    for x in range(10):\n        yield x\n\n# Use numpy.fromiter to create an array from the generator\narray_from_generator = np.fromiter(gimme(), dtype=int, count=-1)\n\nprint(array_from_generator)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- `np.fromiter()`: This function takes an iterable as its first argument and constructs an array from it. \n- `dtype`: Specifies the data type of the array. It's important to define this to ensure that the array is constructed with the correct type.\n- `count`: Number of items to read from the iterator. If set to `-1`, it reads until the iterator is exhausted.\n\nThis approach avoids the creation of an intermediate list and constructs the array directly from the generator, which is more memory-efficient for large data sets."
