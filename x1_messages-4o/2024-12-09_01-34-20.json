For instance, when I try to run \"setup.py install\" for some packages, the \"install\" parameter isn't recognized. I've tried removing Python using the 2.7 and 2.6 msi files and reinstalling only 2.6, but that didn't resolve the problem. How can I completely remove Python from my system without having to reinstall the entire machine?"

If you're sticking with Python 2.x, make sure to install the version that you need, and consider upgrading to Python 3 if possible, since Python 2 has reached the end of its life."
