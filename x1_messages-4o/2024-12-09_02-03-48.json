I am trying to understand how to effectively break down apps and projects, the extent of sharing permissible or necessary between apps in a project, and the suitable location for general templates. I am also interested in incorporating a large number of unit tests that are 2-5 times the size of the actual code base and externalizing strings or templates. Can anyone provide examples, suggestions, or explanations as to why a certain project layout might be better than another?"

Here are some guidelines and suggestions for organizing a large Django project:\n\n### 1. Project Structure\n\nA common approach for structuring a Django project is to use a multi-app architecture. This helps in separating concerns and promoting reusability. Here is a typical layout:\n\n```\nmy_project/\n    manage.py\n    my_project/\n        __init__.py\n        settings.py\n        urls.py\n        wsgi.py\n    app_one/\n        migrations/\n        __init__.py\n        admin.py\n        apps.py\n        models.py\n        tests.py\n        views.py\n        urls.py\n        templates/app_one/\n        static/app_one/\n    app_two/\n        ...\n    common/\n        ...\n    templates/\n        base.html\n    static/\n        ...\n```\n\n### 2. Breaking Down Apps\n\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each app should have a single responsibility. This makes it easier to understand, maintain, and test. For example, if you have a blog, separate apps could be `blog`, `comments`, `users`, etc.\n  \n- **Reusability**: Think about whether the app could be reused in another project. If so, it should be more self-contained.\n\n### 3. Sharing Between Apps\n\n- **Use the `common` app**: Create a `common` or `core` app for shared functionality such as custom middleware, utilities, or base models.\n\n- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: If you find yourself duplicating code across apps, consider refactoring and moving it into the `common` app.\n\n### 4. Templates and Static Files\n\n- **Global Templates and Static Files**: Place them in the `templates` and `static` directories at the project level for shared resources like base templates, CSS, or JS files.\n\n- **App-Specific Templates and Static Files**: Place them inside the respective app directories for resources specific to that app.\n\n### 5. Unit Tests\n\n- **Test Structure**: Structure your tests to mirror your application structure. For example, if you have models, views, and forms, create corresponding test files like `test_models.py`, `test_views.py`, etc.\n\n- **Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage. Tests should be comprehensive, covering edge cases and potential failure points.\n\n- **Organization**: You can use the `tests` package within each app to organize tests better:\n\n  ```\n  app_one/\n      tests/\n          __init__.py\n          test_models.py\n          test_views.py\n          ...\n  ```\n\n### 6. Externalizing Strings and Templates\n\n- **Django Translation**: Use Django's built-in translation framework to externalize strings. This is useful for internationalization (i18n).\n\n- **Template Inheritance**: Use Django's template inheritance to create a base template and extend it across your project. This helps in maintaining consistency and reducing redundancy.\n\n### 7. Example\n\nHere's an example layout for a large Django project with multiple apps:\n\n```\nmy_project/\n    manage.py\n    my_project/\n        __init__.py\n        settings/\n            __init__.py\n            base.py\n            development.py\n            production.py\n        urls.py\n        wsgi.py\n    apps/\n        blog/\n            migrations/\n            __init__.py\n            admin.py\n            apps.py\n            models.py\n            tests/\n                __init__.py\n                test_models.py\n                test_views.py\n            views.py\n            urls.py\n            templates/blog/\n            static/blog/\n        comments/\n            ...\n        users/\n            ...\n    common/\n        utils.py\n        middleware.py\n    templates/\n        base.html\n    static/\n        css/\n        js/\n```\n\nThis structure helps you maintain a clean separation of concerns, facilitates reusability, and makes the project easier to navigate."
