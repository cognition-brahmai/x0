It is said that Aqualoria is a place of breathtaking beauty, where coral palaces gleam in the filtered sunlight and schools of vibrant fish dance through the crystal-clear waters. The kingdom is protected by a powerful enchantment, making it invisible and inaccessible to the outside world. The only way to enter this hidden realm is through a mystical seashell known as the Nautilus Key.\n\n**The Nautilus Key**\n\nThe Nautilus Key is a seashell of unparalleled beauty, swirling with iridescent hues of blue, green, and silver. It is imbued with ancient magic, allowing it to open a portal to Aqualoria when held by one with a pure heart and noble intentions. The Nautilus Key is not easily found; it is said to appear only once every century, washed ashore on a remote beach during the first light of dawn. To claim the key, one must solve a riddle whispered by the ocean winds, proving their worthiness to the seashell's guardian, a wise and ancient sea turtle named Morwen.\n\nOnce acquired, the Nautilus Key must be placed in a special coral alcove at the water's edge. As the waves kiss the shell, a shimmering portal appears, allowing the keyholder to step into the realm of Aqualoria.\n\n### JSON Framework for the Kingdom's Configuration and Population\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Kingdom\": {\n    \"Name\": \"Aqualoria\",\n    \"Geography\": {\n      \"Location\": \"Cerulean Ocean\",\n      \"Features\": [\"Coral Palaces\", \"Crystal-clear Waters\", \"Vibrant Marine Life\"]\n    },\n    \"Population\": {\n      \"Total\": 10000,\n      \"Species\": [\n        {\n          \"Name\": \"Merfolk\",\n          \"Role\": \"Inhabitants\",\n          \"Characteristics\": [\"Half-human, Half-fish\", \"Able to breathe underwater\"]\n        },\n        {\n          \"Name\": \"Sea Elves\",\n          \"Role\": \"Counselors\",\n          \"Characteristics\": [\"Graceful\", \"Magic Users\"]\n        },\n        {\n          \"Name\": \"Aquatic Guardians\",\n          \"Role\": \"Protectors\",\n          \"Characteristics\": [\"Warriors\", \"Skilled in Combat\"]\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    \"Ruling Council\": {\n      \"King\": {\n        \"Name\": \"King Triton\",\n        \"Obligations\": [\n          \"Maintain Peace\",\n          \"Oversee Kingdom Affairs\",\n          \"Lead the Council\"\n        ]\n      },\n      \"Queen\": {\n        \"Name\": \"Queen Marina\",\n        \"Obligations\": [\n          \"Protect the Kingdom's Magic\",\n          \"Guide Social and Cultural Activities\",\n          \"Support the King\"\n        ]\n      },\n      \"Council Members\": [\n        {\n          \"Name\": \"Lord Coral\",\n          \"Role\": \"Advisor\",\n          \"Obligations\": [\"Advise the King\", \"Manage Resources\"]\n        },\n        {\n          \"Name\": \"Lady Pearl\",\n          \"Role\": \"High Priestess\",\n          \"Obligations\": [\"Conduct Ceremonies\", \"Guard Spiritual Well-being\"]\n        },\n        {\n          \"Name\": \"Sir Fin\",\n          \"Role\": \"Head Guardian\",\n          \"Obligations\": [\"Lead the Aquatic Guardians\", \"Ensure Protection\"]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Characteristics and Powers of the Nautilus Key\n\n- **Appearance**: The Nautilus Key is a large, spiral seashell with hues of blue, green, and silver that change with the light.
