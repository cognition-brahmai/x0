        "content": "The method you've suggested is a good way to format your code to keep it under 80 characters. By assigning the string to a variable, you've achieved a neat and readable format. However, there are other ways to break down the line if you prefer not to use an intermediate variable. Here are a couple of alternatives:\n\n### Option 1: Using Implicit String Concatenation\n```python\nlogger.info(\n    \"Skipping {0} because its thumbnail was already in our system as {1}.\"\n    .format(line[indexes['url']], video.title)\n)\n```\n\n### Option 2: Using Line Continuation with Parentheses\n```python\nlogger.info(\n    \"Skipping {0} because its thumbnail was already in our system as {1}.\"\n    .format(line[indexes['url']], video.title)\n)\n```\n\n### Option 3: Using f-strings (Python 3.6+)\nIf you are using Python 3.6 or later, you can use f-strings for a more concise syntax:\n```python\nurl = line[indexes['url']]\ntitle = video.title\nlogger.info(\n    f\"Skipping {url} because its thumbnail was already in our system as {title}.\"\n)\n```\n\nAll these approaches maintain readability and ensure your lines don't exceed 80 characters. Choose the one that best fits your style and the project's conventions."
