        "content": "The LaTeX code you provided is a good starting point for creating a table that displays the conjugation of the verb \"to be\" across different tenses for singular and plural subjects, along with example sentences. Here's a step-by-step explanation and the complete code:\n\n1. **Document Class and Packages**: \n   - The `article` class is chosen for simplicity.\n   - `booktabs` is used for aesthetically pleasing horizontal lines in tables.\n   - `array` is used for defining new column types with specific alignments.\n   - `multirow` is used to span the subject column across multiple rows.\n  \n2. **New Column Types**:\n   - `C` is defined for centered text with a 2cm width.\n   - `L` is defined for left-aligned text with a 6cm width.\n\n3. **Table Layout**:\n   - The table is centered and includes a caption and label for referencing.\n   - A multi-row entry is used for the \"Subject\" column.\n   - The tense headers span multiple columns for clarity.\n\n4. **Table Content**:\n   - Each row corresponds to a subject pronoun (I, You, He/She/It, We, You all, They) with their respective verb forms.\n   - Example sentences are provided for each tense in the last row.\n\nBelow is the refined LaTeX code:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{booktabs}\n\\usepackage{array}\n\\usepackage{multirow}\n\\newcolumntype{C}{>{\\centering\\arraybackslash}p{2cm}}\n\\newcolumntype{L}{>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{6cm}}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{table}[h!]\n  \\centering\n  \\caption{Conjugation of the verb \"to be\"}\n  \\label{tab:conjugation}\n  \\begin{tabular}{CLCCCCC}\n    \\toprule\n    & & \\multicolumn{6}{c}{Tense} \\\\\n    \\cmidrule(lr){3-8}\n    & & Present & Past & Future & Present Perfect & Past Perfect & Future Perfect \\\\\n    \\midrule\n    \\multirow{6}{*}{\\rotatebox[origin=c]{90}{Subject}}\n    & I & am & was & will be & have been & had been & will have been \\\\\n    & You & are & were & will be & have been & had been & will have been \\\\\n    & He/She/It & is & was & will be & has been & had been & will have been \\\\\n    & We & are & were & will be & have been & had been & will have been \\\\\n    & You all & are & were & will be & have been & had been & will have been \\\\\n    & They & are & were & will be & have been & had been & will have been \\\\\n    \\midrule\n    & Example & I am a teacher. & You were at the store. & He will be here tomorrow. & We have been to France. & You all had been studying for hours. & They will have been married for 10 years. \\\\\n    \\bottomrule\n  \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nThis code will generate a neatly formatted table with the conjugation of \"to be\" in different tenses, complete with example sentences. Make sure to compile it with a LaTeX editor that supports PDF output (like Overleaf, TeXShop, or TeXworks) to see the table rendered correctly."
