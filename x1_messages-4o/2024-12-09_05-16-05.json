Here's the code I'm currently using:\n\n```python\nz.write(article.replace('</html>.+', '</html>'))\n```\n\nDoes .replace() function in Python support regex?"

        "content": "No, the `.replace()` function in Python does not support regular expressions. It is designed to replace fixed sequences of characters. If you want to use regular expressions to perform the replacement, you should use the `re` module, which provides the `re.sub()` function for such tasks. Here's how you can modify your code using `re.sub()` to remove all text following the `</html>` tag:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Assuming 'article' is your string containing HTML content\ncleaned_article = re.sub(r'</html>.*', '</html>', article, flags=re.DOTALL)\n\n# Write the cleaned content to the file\nz.write(cleaned_article)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- `r'</html>.*'` is the regular expression pattern. `.*` matches any character (except a newline) zero or more times, effectively capturing everything after `</html>`.\n- `flags=re.DOTALL` allows the `.` character in the regex to match newline characters as well, ensuring that any text after `</html>` is captured, even if it spans multiple lines.\n- `re.sub()` replaces the matched text with `'</html>'`, removing everything after the `</html>` tag."
