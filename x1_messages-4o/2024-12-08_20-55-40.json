The population sizes are represented as follows:\nYear 1: 100 birds\nYear 2: 120 birds\nYear 3: 144 birds\nYear 4: 173 birds\nYear 5: 207 birds\nYear 6: 248 birds\nYear 7: 298 birds\nYear 8: 357 birds\nYear 9: 428 birds\nYear 10: 513 birds\nUsing this data, predict the population size of this species in Year 11, assuming the population continues to grow at the same rate."

        "content": "To predict the population size in Year 11, we can analyze the trend in the given data. The population seems to be growing at an increasing rate, suggesting an exponential growth pattern. We can use a simple exponential growth model for this prediction.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the growth rates between each consecutive year:\n\n1. Year 2 to Year 1: \\( \\frac{120}{100} = 1.20 \\)\n2. Year 3 to Year 2: \\( \\frac{144}{120} = 1.20 \\)\n3. Year 4 to Year 3: \\( \\frac{173}{144} \\approx 1.201 \\)\n4. Year 5 to Year 4: \\( \\frac{207}{173} \\approx 1.197 \\)\n5. Year 6 to Year 5: \\( \\frac{248}{207} \\approx 1.198 \\)\n6. Year 7 to Year 6: \\( \\frac{298}{248} \\approx 1.202 \\)\n7. Year 8 to Year 7: \\( \\frac{357}{298} \\approx 1.198 \\)\n8. Year 9 to Year 8: \\( \\frac{428}{357} \\approx 1.199 \\)\n9. Year 10 to Year 9: \\( \\frac{513}{428} \\approx 1.199 \\)\n\nThe average growth rate over the years is approximately 1.20. Using this average growth rate, we can predict the population in Year 11 by multiplying the Year 10 population by the growth rate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Population in Year 11} = 513 \\times 1.20 = 615.6 \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the predicted population size in Year 11 is approximately 616 birds."
