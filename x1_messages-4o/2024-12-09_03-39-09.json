Can someone help me understand why this error is occurring even though I have set the PYTHON environmental variable as shown in the image below?\n\n![PYTHON environmental variable](https://i.stack.imgur.com/iTJkM.png)"

Here are a few steps and tips you can try to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify Python Path**: Double-check that the path to the Python executable is correct in your environment variables. Make sure the path ends with the actual Python executable (e.g., `C:\\Python39\\python.exe`).\n\n2. **Correct Environment Variable**: Ensure that the environment variable is named `PYTHON` and is set at the system level, not just the user level. You can check this by going to System Properties > Advanced > Environment Variables.\n\n3. **Python Version**: Ensure that you are using a version of Python that is compatible with `node-gyp`. Typically, Python 2.7 or Python 3.x (up to 3.8) is recommended.\n\n4. **Command Prompt**: After setting the environment variable, make sure to restart your command prompt or terminal to apply the changes. Try running the command again in a new terminal session.\n\n5. **Path Environment Variable**: Add Python to your `PATH` environment variable as well. This can sometimes help in locating the Python executable. You can do this by appending the Python directory (e.g., `C:\\Python39\\`) to your `PATH`.\n\n6. **Check Python Installation**: Run `python --version` in your terminal to ensure that the Python executable is accessible and correctly set up.\n\n7. **Use `npm` Config**: Instead of relying solely on environment variables, you can configure npm to use a specific Python executable by running:\n   ```bash\n   npm config set python \"C:\\Path\\To\\Python\\python.exe\"\n   ```\n\n8. **Reinstall Node-Gyp**: It's possible that `node-gyp` might be misconfigured. Try reinstalling it globally:\n   ```bash\n   npm uninstall -g node-gyp\n   npm install -g node-gyp\n   ```\n\n9. **Visual Studio**: Ensure that your Visual Studio setup has the necessary build tools and C++ components installed.\n\n10. **Check Community Resources**: Sometimes, specific versions of tools or libraries have known issues. Checking the GitHub issues page for `node-gyp` or related repositories might provide additional insights.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue. If the problem persists, feel free to provide additional details, and I'll be glad to assist further."
