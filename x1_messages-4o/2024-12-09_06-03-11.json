        "content": "Python does not have extension methods in the same way that C# does. However, you can achieve similar functionality using a few different approaches. Here are some ways you can simulate extension methods for built-in types like `int`:\n\n1. **Monkey Patching**: You can add methods to a class at runtime by assigning a function to the class. This is generally not recommended because it can lead to code that is hard to maintain and understand, especially if the method name conflicts with future updates to the class.\n\n   ```python\n   def my_random_method(self):\n       return self + 42\n\n   int.my_random_method = my_random_method\n\n   my_int = 10\n   print(my_int.my_random_method())  # Output: 52\n   ```\n\n2. **Subclassing**: You can create a subclass of the built-in type and add your method there. This approach is safer and more maintainable than monkey patching.\n\n   ```python\n   class MyInt(int):\n       def my_random_method(self):\n           return self + 42\n\n   my_int = MyInt(10)\n   print(my_int.my_random_method())  # Output: 52\n   ```\n\n3. **Wrapper Class**: You can create a wrapper class that contains an instance of the built-in type and add your methods to this class.\n\n   ```python\n   class IntWrapper:\n       def __init__(self, value):\n           self.value = value\n\n       def my_random_method(self):\n           return self.value + 42\n\n       # Optionally, you can define __str__ and other special methods\n       def __str__(self):\n           return str(self.value)\n\n   my_int = IntWrapper(10)\n   print(my_int.my_random_method())  # Output: 52\n   ```\n\nEach of these methods has its own use cases, and you should choose the one that best fits your needs and coding style. Subclassing and wrapper classes are generally more robust and maintainable compared to monkey patching."
