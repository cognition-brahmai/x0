        "content": "The error you are encountering, `django.db.utils.ProgrammingError: relation \"auth_user\" does not exist`, typically indicates that the database table for the `auth_user` model hasn't been created yet. This issue can occur during the migration process, especially when upgrading Django versions.\n\nHere are some steps to help you resolve the issue when upgrading to Django 1.8:\n\n1. **Ensure Migrations are Applied:**\n   - Django 1.7 introduced migrations, and Django 1.8 relies on them. Make sure all initial migrations are applied. You can apply them using:\n     ```bash\n     python manage.py migrate\n     ```\n\n2. **Check Migration Files:**\n   - Verify that you have the initial migration files for the `auth` app and any other apps you are using. These files should be in `your_project/migrations/` and `auth/migrations/`.\n\n3. **Run Migrations for Built-in Apps:**\n   - Ensure that you have run the migrations for built-in apps like `auth`. You can do this by specifying the app:\n     ```bash\n     python manage.py migrate auth\n     ```\n\n4. **Check Database State:**\n   - Make sure that your database is in a consistent state. If you have partial migrations or if the database schema does not match the current state of your models, you might need to reset the database or manually adjust it.\n\n5. **Inspect Migration History:**\n   - Use the `showmigrations` command to inspect which migrations have been applied:\n     ```bash\n     python manage.py showmigrations\n     ```\n\n6. **Review Your Database Configuration:**\n   - Ensure your database settings in `settings.py` are correct and that the database user has the necessary permissions to create tables.\n\n7. **Re-create the Database:**\n   - As a last resort, if the database is not in a usable state, you might need to recreate it:\n     ```bash\n     # Drop the existing database and create a new one\n     python manage.py flush  # Warning: This will delete all data!\n     python manage.py migrate\n     ```\n\n8. **Backup Your Data:**\n   - Before making any major changes, ensure you have a backup of your data.\n\nBy addressing the above steps, you should be able to resolve the migration issue when upgrading to Django 1.8. If the problem persists, consider checking the Django documentation for any additional changes in migration handling between 1.7 and 1.8."
