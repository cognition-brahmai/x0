Here's the code I executed in my interpreter:\n\n```python\nr1 = range(0)\nr2 = range(2, 2, 2)\nr1 == r2\n```\n\nThe output I get is `True`. Why does this happen? Why are the `range` objects, `r1` and `r2`, considered equal despite being initialized with different values?"

        "content": "In Python, two `range` objects are considered equal if they represent the same sequence of numbers. In the scenario you described, both `r1` and `r2` represent empty ranges, which is why they are considered equal.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the two `range` objects:\n\n1. `r1 = range(0)`: This creates a range that starts at 0 and ends at 0, effectively representing an empty sequence because there are no numbers in this range.\n\n2. `r2 = range(2, 2, 2)`: This creates a range starting at 2, ending at 2, with a step of 2. Since the start and end are the same, there are no numbers in this sequence, so it is also an empty range.\n\nSince both `r1` and `r2` represent the same empty sequence, they are considered equal. In Python, when comparing `range` objects, the equality check looks at the sequence of numbers they represent, not the specific parameters used to create them. Thus, two empty ranges are always equal, regardless of how they are defined."
