I want to use a for loop for this because I need to use the same index for other arrays as well. The current code I have is as follows:\n```python\nfor index, item in emails:\n    if emails[index] == 'something@something.com':\n         emails.pop(index)\n         otherarray.pop(index)\n```\nHowever, I am having trouble getting this to work correctly. How can I improve this code?"

        "content": "The issue with your current code is that iterating over a list while modifying it (such as using `pop`) can lead to unexpected behavior, including skipping elements or encountering an index that no longer exists. Instead, you can iterate over a copy of the list or build a new list of indices to remove. Here's how you can modify your code to safely remove elements from both `emails` and `otherarray`:\n\n```python\nemails = ['example1@example.com', 'something@something.com', 'example2@example.com']\notherarray = ['data1', 'data2', 'data3']\n\n# Collect indices to remove\nindices_to_remove = [index for index, item in enumerate(emails) if item == 'something@something.com']\n\n# Remove elements using the collected indices\nfor index in sorted(indices_to_remove, reverse=True):\n    emails.pop(index)\n    otherarray.pop(index)\n\nprint(emails)\nprint(otherarray)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Collect Indices First:** Use a list comprehension with `enumerate` to collect all indices where the condition is met.\n2. **Reverse Sort Indices:** Sort the indices in reverse order. This ensures that when you modify the list by removing elements, you start from the back, minimizing the chance of affecting the indices of elements yet to be checked.\n3. **Iterate Over Indices:** Use a loop to remove elements from both lists using the indices collected.\n\nThis approach ensures that you safely modify the lists without encountering issues related to changing list sizes during iteration."
