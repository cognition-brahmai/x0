For instance, I am familiar with using `enumerate()` for a flat sequence as shown below:\n\n```python\nseq_flat = ('A', 'B', 'C')\nfor num, entry in enumerate(seq_flat):\n    print num, entry\n# Output:\n# 0 A\n# 1 B\n# 2 C\n```\n\nNow, I want to achieve the same for a nested list such as:\n\n```python\nseq_nested = (('A', 'Apple'), ('B', 'Boat'), ('C', 'Cat'))\n```\n\nI can unpack it with:\n\n```python\nfor letter, word in seq_nested:\n    print letter, word\n# Output:\n# A Apple\n# B Boat\n# C Cat\n```\n\nHowever, how can I unpack it to get the index number as well such as in the following output?\n\n```\n0 A Apple\n1 B Boat\n2 C Cat\n```\n\nThe only method I am aware of is to use a counter/incrementor, but I believe it is un-Pythonic. Is there a more Pythonic or elegant way to do this?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this using `enumerate()` in a Pythonic way. The `enumerate()` function can be used directly with nested tuples or lists to get both the index and the unpacked elements. Here's how you can modify your code to get the desired output:\n\n```python\nseq_nested = (('A', 'Apple'), ('B', 'Boat'), ('C', 'Cat'))\n\nfor index, (letter, word) in enumerate(seq_nested):\n    print(index, letter, word)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n0 A Apple\n1 B Boat\n2 C Cat\n```\n\nIn this example, `enumerate()` provides the index and the tuple, which you can then unpack into `letter` and `word` directly within the loop. This approach is both Pythonic and elegant, as it leverages the built-in capabilities of Python to handle such scenarios efficiently."
