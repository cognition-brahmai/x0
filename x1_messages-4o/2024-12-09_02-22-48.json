        "content": "A Python dictionary is not inherently thread-safe. This means that if you are working with dictionaries in a multi-threaded environment, you need to implement your own synchronization mechanisms to ensure that concurrent access to the dictionary does not lead to race conditions or data corruption. You can use threading locks, such as `threading.Lock`, to manage access to the dictionary safely.\n\nRegarding modifying a dictionary while iterating over it, it's generally not recommended. Modifying a dictionary (or any collection) while iterating over it can lead to unpredictable behavior, including runtime errors. For example, adding or removing items can change the dictionary's size during iteration, which can cause the iterator to skip or repeat items.\n\nIf you need to modify a dictionary while iterating over it, a common approach is to iterate over a copy of the dictionary's keys or items. Here\u2019s an example:\n\n```python\n# Iterating over a copy of the keys\nfor key in list(my_dict.keys()):\n    # Safe to modify my_dict here\n    if some_condition(key):\n        del my_dict[key]\n```\n\nThis way, you're iterating over a static list of keys, allowing you to safely modify the original dictionary."
