I am trying to use 'str.contains()' function to check if the string values of the first dataframe are present in the URLs of the second dataframe.

How can I resolve this issue and successfully check if the strings are present in the URLs?"

        "content": "The UserWarning you're encountering is related to the presence of capturing groups in your pattern when using `str.contains()`. Capturing groups are specified by parentheses in regular expressions and are used to extract parts of the match. This warning suggests that your pattern might unintentionally have such groups.\n\nTo resolve this issue and successfully check if the string values from the first dataframe are present in the URLs of the second dataframe, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Ensure No Capturing Groups**: Check your pattern to ensure that it doesn't contain any unintended capturing groups. If you are using parentheses for grouping, but not for capturing, you can use non-capturing groups by adding `?:` at the start of the group, like this: `(?:pattern)`.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Rows**: If you want to check each string against each URL, you might need to iterate over the rows of your dataframes.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Example DataFrames\ndf_strings = pd.DataFrame({\n    'strings': ['example', 'test', 'sample']\n})\n\ndf_urls = pd.DataFrame({\n    'urls': ['http://example.com', 'https://testsite.org', 'http://samplepage.net']\n})\n\n# Function to check if any string is present in the URL\ndef check_strings_in_url(url, strings):\n    for s in strings:\n        if s in url:\n            return True\n    return False\n\n# Apply the function to each URL in df_urls\ndf_urls['contains_string'] = df_urls['urls'].apply(lambda url: check_strings_in_url(url, df_strings['strings']))\n\nprint(df_urls)\n```\n\nThis approach manually checks if any of the strings are present in each URL without using regular expressions, thus avoiding the issue with capturing groups. Adjust and optimize it as needed for your specific use case."
