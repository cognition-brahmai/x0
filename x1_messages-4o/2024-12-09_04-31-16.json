I have attempted to use the code below, but it's not moving the files as expected, even though I'm not receiving any errors.

        "content": "It looks like you're trying to move text files from one directory to another using Python. Let's address a few issues in your code and ensure it performs as expected:\n\n1. Ensure you have the correct paths.\n2. Use `shutil.move()` instead of `shutil.copy2()` if you want to move files instead of copying them.\n3. Use the correct path for the source directory.\n4. Correct syntax issues, like missing quotes in `os.makedirs()`.\n\nHere's a revised version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport shutil\nimport glob\n\n# Source directory where text files are located\nsrc = '/path/to/dir/Caches/com.apple.Safari/WebKitCache/Version 4/Blobs'\n\n# Destination directory\ndst = '/path/to/dir/Tumblr/Uploads'\n\n# Create destination directory if it doesn't exist\nos.makedirs(dst, exist_ok=True)\n\n# Change to the source directory\nos.chdir(src)\n\n# Loop through all text files in the source directory\nfor txt_file in glob.iglob('*.txt'):\n    # Construct full file path\n    full_file_path = os.path.join(src, txt_file)\n    \n    # Move the file\n    shutil.move(full_file_path, dst)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Path Accuracy**: Ensure both `src` and `dst` paths are correctly specified.\n- **Move vs Copy**: Use `shutil.move()` to move files instead of `shutil.copy2()`.\n- **Directory Navigation**: `os.chdir()` changes the current working directory to `src` before listing files with `glob.iglob()`.\n- **Create Directory**: Use `os.makedirs(dst, exist_ok=True)` to create the destination directory if it doesn't exist.\n\nMake sure to replace the placeholder paths with the actual paths on your system. Also, ensure you have the necessary permissions to read from the source directory and write to the destination directory."
