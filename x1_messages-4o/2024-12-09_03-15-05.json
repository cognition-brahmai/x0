I downloaded it from GitHub, navigated into the directory, and ran `python setup.py build`. However, I encountered an error during the process. The error indicates that the system could not locate executable gfortran, f95, f90, f77, xlf90, xlf, ifort, ifc, g77, g95, pgfortran and it doesn't know how to compile Fortran code on platform 'posix'. Additionally, while trying to build the 'dfftpack' library, it states that the library has Fortran sources but no Fortran compiler found. I was under the impression that I had Fortran installed for NumPy. How can I rectify this issue?"

        "content": "It seems like the issue you're encountering is related to the absence of a Fortran compiler on your system. SciPy relies on Fortran for some of its components, and while NumPy may not have required a Fortran compiler, SciPy does. Here's how you can rectify the issue:\n\n1. **Install a Fortran Compiler**:\n   - The most commonly used Fortran compiler for Mac OS X is `gfortran`. You can install it using Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can install it by running the following command in your terminal:\n     ```bash\n     /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n     ```\n   - Once Homebrew is installed, you can install `gfortran` by running:\n     ```bash\n     brew install gcc\n     ```\n   - This installs `gfortran` as part of the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).\n\n2. **Verify Installation**:\n   - To ensure that `gfortran` is installed correctly, run:\n     ```bash\n     gfortran --version\n     ```\n   - This should display the version of `gfortran` that you have installed.\n\n3. **Rebuild SciPy**:\n   - Now that you have a Fortran compiler installed, try rebuilding and installing SciPy:\n     ```bash\n     python setup.py build\n     python setup.py install\n     ```\n\n4. **Check Your PATH**:\n   - Ensure that the directory containing `gfortran` is in your system's PATH. You can check this by running:\n     ```bash\n     which gfortran\n     ```\n   - If the command returns a path, then it's correctly set up. If not, you might need to add the directory to your PATH in your `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, or `.bashrc` file (depending on your shell).\n\n5. **Alternative**:\n   - If you continue to face issues, consider using a pre-built binary of SciPy that includes all the necessary dependencies. You can install SciPy via pip, which often resolves such issues with dependencies:\n     ```bash\n     pip install scipy\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the Fortran compiler issue and successfully build and install SciPy on your Mac OS X system."
