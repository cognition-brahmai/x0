However, I'm encountering an issue where the `name` field isn't being set correctly when creating an instance for the first time, as demonstrated with the \"Timber\" example below:\n\n```python\n>>> p1, c1 = Provider.objects.get_or_create(name__iexact=\"Timber\")\n>>> p1, c1\n(<Provider: >, True)\n>>> p1.name\nu''\n```\nOn the other hand, it works as expected in the following cases:\n\n```python\n>>> p2, c2 = Provider.objects.get_or_create(name=\"Cedar\")\n>>> p2.name, c2\n('Cedar', True)\n>>> p3, c3 = Provider.objects.get_or_create(name__iexact=\"Cedar\")\n>>> p3, c3\n(<Provider: Cedar>, False)\n>>> Provider.objects.get_or_create(name__iexact=\"cedar\")\n(<Provider: Cedar>, False)\n```\n\nIs `__iexact` incompatible with the `create` portion of `get_or_create`? Is this expected behavior or is it a bug in Django?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to the way `get_or_create` works with query parameters and how it interprets them when creating a new instance. In Django, the `get_or_create` method is designed to retrieve an object if it exists, or create it if it doesn't. However, the parameters you pass to `get_or_create` have specific roles:\n\n1. The keyword arguments are used to define the query for `get`.\n2. If an object is not found, the same keyword arguments are used to populate fields for `create`.\n\nWhen you use a field lookup like `name__iexact`, it is intended for querying purposes only, not for setting field values during creation. This is because `name__iexact` doesn't directly map to a field name; it's a lookup expression.\n\nIn your example:\n\n```python\np1, c1 = Provider.objects.get_or_create(name__iexact=\"Timber\")\n```\n\nThe `name__iexact=\"Timber\"` is treated as a query filter, but it does not set the `name` field during the creation of a new instance. Therefore, you're effectively creating an empty instance with no `name` value set, which is why you're seeing `u''`.\n\nTo fix this, you need to separate the filter logic from the creation logic. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nname_to_search = \"Timber\"\np1, created = Provider.objects.get_or_create(\n    name__iexact=name_to_search,\n    defaults={'name': name_to_search}  # Use `defaults` to set the name field during creation\n)\n```\n\nBy using the `defaults` parameter, you ensure that the `name` field is correctly set when a new `Provider` instance is created. The `defaults` dictionary allows you to specify field values for creation without interfering with the query logic."
