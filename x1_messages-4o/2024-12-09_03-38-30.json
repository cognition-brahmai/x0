I'm using the latest version of webdriver for my Chrome's version. Here's the code and error messages I'm getting:\n\n```python\ndef run(driver_path):    \n    driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=driver_path)    \n    driver.get('https://tproger.ru/quiz/real-programmer/')    \n    button = driver.find_element_by_class_name(\"quiz_button\")\n    button.click()\n\nrun(driver_path)\n```\n\nError messages:\n\n```python\n<ipython-input-27-c5a7960e105f>:6: DeprecationWarning: executable_path has been deprecated, please pass in a Service object\n  driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=driver_path)\n<ipython-input-27-c5a7960e105f>:10: DeprecationWarning: find_element_by_* commands are deprecated. Please use find_element() instead\n  button = driver.find_element_by_class_name(\"quiz_button\")\n```\n\nDespite the command being documented, why am I getting a deprecation warning for `find_element_by_*` commands?"

        "content": "The deprecation warnings you're encountering are due to updates in the Selenium library. In recent versions, Selenium has made changes to improve and modernize the API. Here's how you can update your code to align with the latest Selenium practices:\n\n1. **Using the Service Object:** Instead of passing the `executable_path` directly, you should create a `Service` object from the `webdriver.chrome.service` module and pass it to the `webdriver.Chrome` constructor.\n\n2. **Replacing `find_element_by_*` Methods:** The `find_element_by_*` methods have been deprecated in favor of a more unified `find_element()` method that uses `By` class from `selenium.webdriver.common.by` to specify the selector strategy.\n\nHere is the updated code:\n\n```python\nfrom selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.by import By\n\ndef run(driver_path):\n    # Create a Service object\n    service = Service(driver_path)\n    \n    # Initialize the Chrome driver with the Service object\n    driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=service)\n    \n    # Open the webpage\n    driver.get('https://tproger.ru/quiz/real-programmer/')\n    \n    # Use find_element with By.CLASS_NAME\n    button = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, \"quiz_button\")\n    \n    # Click the button\n    button.click()\n\n# Example driver path\ndriver_path = '/path/to/chromedriver'\nrun(driver_path)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- **Service Object:** We created a `Service` object and passed it to the `webdriver.Chrome` constructor.\n- **By Class:** We used `By.CLASS_NAME` instead of `find_element_by_class_name`.\n\nThese changes will help you avoid the deprecation warnings and keep your code updated with the latest Selenium best practices. Make sure to replace `'/path/to/chromedriver'` with the actual path to your `chromedriver`."
