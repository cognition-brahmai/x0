I have 39,592 samples in my training set and 9,899 in my validation set, and I use a batch size of 2. In my code, I calculated my steps_per_epoch and validation_steps as follows:\n\n```python\nsteps_per_epoch = int(number_of_train_samples / batch_size)\nval_steps = int(number_of_val_samples / batch_size)\n```\n\nHowever, I have observed that I may be missing some batches of data in my generators. I also have concerns about the reliability of the models I have trained so far. Is there a more accurate way to set these variables without having to set the batch size to 1 or remove some of the samples? What would the outcome be if I used the following code instead:\n\n```python\nsteps_per_epoch = np.ceil(number_of_train_samples / batch_size)\nval_steps = np.ceil(number_of_val_samples / batch_size)\n```\n\nWould my model end up seeing some of the images more than once during each training and validation epoch?"

        "content": "When using Keras with data generators, setting the `steps_per_epoch` and `validation_steps` accurately is crucial for ensuring that your model sees all the data. Let's break down the implications of your current setup and the proposed change.\n\n### Current Setup\n\nYou are using:\n\n```python\nsteps_per_epoch = int(number_of_train_samples / batch_size)\nval_steps = int(number_of_val_samples / batch_size)\n```\n\nWith this setup:\n- You might miss out on the last few samples if the total number of samples is not perfectly divisible by the batch size. This is because `int()` truncates the decimal part, leading to a lower number of steps, and hence some samples are not seen by the model.\n- For example, with 39,592 training samples and a batch size of 2, `int(39592 / 2)` gives 19,796 steps, but you have an extra sample that isn't accounted for.\n\n### Proposed Change\n\nSwitching to:\n\n```python\nsteps_per_epoch = np.ceil(number_of_train_samples / batch_size)\nval_steps = np.ceil(number_of_val_samples / batch_size)\n```\n\nWith this configuration:\n- Using `np.ceil()` will round up to the nearest integer, ensuring that all samples are processed, even if the last batch is smaller than the specified batch size.\n- This means if you have leftover samples (e.g., 1 sample in a 2-sample batch size), they will still be processed in an additional step.\n- Consequently, the model will see some samples more than once within an epoch if there are leftover samples after dividing by the batch size.\n\n### Implications\n\n- **Seeing Images More than Once:** If `np.ceil()` results in an extra step, the few samples at the end of the dataset will be seen again in the next epoch. This is generally not a concern, especially if you are using data augmentation or other regularization techniques.\n- **Accuracy and Generalization:** By ensuring all samples are seen, you are likely improving the model's ability to generalize, as it trains on the complete dataset. However, be aware of overfitting, especially if the dataset is small.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- Switching to `np.ceil()` is generally more accurate and ensures that all your data is used during training and validation.\n- If your dataset size is large and you are concerned about redundancy, consider using data augmentation or shuffling the data to mitigate any slight redundancy from samples being seen more than once.\n- Always monitor your validation metrics to ensure that the model is learning effectively and not overfitting to the training data."
