You can apply this method directly on the column you want to filter. Here's how you can modify your SQLAlchemy query to achieve this:\n\nAssuming `table` is your SQLAlchemy table object and `YourColumn` is the column you want to check for `NOT NULL` values, your query would look like this:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import select\n\n# Assuming table is your Table object and YourColumn is the column you want to check\nquery = select(table).where(table.c.YourColumn.isnot(None))\n\n# If you have multiple filters, you can combine them using logical operators\n# For example, if you have other filters stored in all_filters:\nall_filters = [table.c.YourColumn.isnot(None), ...]  # Add other conditions as needed\n\nquery = select(table).where(*all_filters)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- `table.c.YourColumn` accesses the column named `YourColumn` in your table.\n- `.isnot(None)` is used to filter out rows where `YourColumn` is `NOT NULL`.\n- `all_filters` can be a list of multiple conditions that you want to apply to the query. Use `*all_filters` to unpack the list into separate arguments for the `where()` method."
