I've noticed from the CUDA tag wiki and various comments on CUDA questions that it is often recommended to check the return status of every API call for errors. The API documentation includes functions like `cudaGetLastError`, `cudaPeekAtLastError`, and `cudaGetErrorString`. How can I best implement these to consistently catch and report errors without necessitating a large amount of extra code?"

        "content": "To effectively check for errors in CUDA programs using the CUDA runtime API, it is important to systematically check the return status of every API call. This can be done by implementing a simple error-checking mechanism that minimizes the amount of extra code required. Here's a method that can help you achieve this:\n\n1. **Create a Macro for Error Checking**: Define a macro that wraps around CUDA API calls, checks for an error, and reports it if one is found. This will help you avoid repetitive code and make error handling consistent.\n\n```cpp\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n#include <iostream>\n\n// Macro to check CUDA errors\n#define CUDA_CHECK(call)                                                       \\\n    do {                                                                       \\\n        cudaError_t error = call;                                              \\\n        if (error != cudaSuccess) {                                            \\\n            std::cerr << \"CUDA error in \" << __FILE__ << \" at line \" << __LINE__ \\\n                      << \": \" << cudaGetErrorString(error) << std::endl;       \\\n            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);                                                \\\n        }                                                                      \\\n    } while (0)\n```\n\n2. **Usage of the Macro**: Replace your CUDA API calls with the macro so that errors are automatically caught and reported.\n\n```cpp\nint main() {\n    int *d_array;\n    size_t size = 10 * sizeof(int);\n\n    // Allocate memory on the device\n    CUDA_CHECK(cudaMalloc(&d_array, size));\n\n    // Other CUDA operations...\n\n    // Free device memory\n    CUDA_CHECK(cudaFree(d_array));\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n3. **Use `cudaGetLastError` and `cudaPeekAtLastError`**: Sometimes, kernel launches do not return an error directly. After launching a kernel, use these functions to check for any errors:\n\n```cpp\n// Kernel launch\nmyKernel<<<blocks, threads>>>(...);\n\n// Check for errors after kernel launch\nCUDA_CHECK(cudaPeekAtLastError());\nCUDA_CHECK(cudaDeviceSynchronize());\n```\n\n4. **Error Reporting**: Use `cudaGetErrorString` within the macro to convert error codes to human-readable strings, making debugging easier.\n\nBy using the `CUDA_CHECK` macro, you encapsulate the error-checking logic in a single place, ensuring consistent handling and reporting of errors throughout your code without adding significant overhead. This approach will help maintain readability and keep the codebase clean while ensuring that any errors are caught and reported immediately."
