I'm encountering an error with my code, specifically when I try to execute an INSERT command. The error message states: \"ProgrammingError: SQLite objects created in a thread can only be used in that same thread. The object was created in thread id 23508 and this is thread id 22640\". Does this mean I can't use the variables name, email, username, and password in an HTML file? How can I solve this issue? \n\nHere's the relevant part of my code:\n\n```python\n@app.route('/register', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef register():\n    form = RegisterForm(request.form)\n    if request.method=='POST' and form.validate():\n        name =  form.name.data \n        email = form.email.data\n        username = form.username.data\n        password = sha256_crypt.encrypt(str(form.password.data))\n\n        c.execute(\"INSERT INTO users(name,email,username,password) \n        VALUES(?,?,?,?)\", (name, email, username, password))\n\n        conn.commit\n\n        conn.close()\n```"

        "content": "The error you're experiencing is due to the SQLite connection being used across different threads. Flask's development server is single-threaded by default, but if you have threaded mode enabled or if you're running in a multi-threaded environment, you might run into this issue.\n\nHere are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Use `g` for Database Connections**: Use Flask's `g` object to store your database connection for each request. This ensures that each request gets its own connection, preventing issues with threading. You can open a connection at the start of a request and close it when the request is finished.\n\n2. **Ensure Connection Closure**: Make sure that you always close the database connection properly after each request. You can do this by using Flask's `teardown_appcontext` decorator.\n\n3. **Function to Get Database Connection**: Define a function to get the database connection, which ensures a new connection is used for each request.\n\nHere's how you can refactor your code:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, g\nimport sqlite3\nfrom passlib.hash import sha256_crypt\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\nDATABASE = 'path_to_your_database.db'\n\ndef get_db():\n    if 'db' not in g:\n        g.db = sqlite3.connect(DATABASE)\n        g.db.row_factory = sqlite3.Row\n    return g.db\n\n@app.teardown_appcontext\ndef close_db(exception):\n    db = g.pop('db', None)\n    if db is not None:\n        db.close()\n\n@app.route('/register', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef register():\n    form = RegisterForm(request.form)\n    if request.method == 'POST' and form.validate():\n        name = form.name.data\n        email = form.email.data\n        username = form.username.data\n        password = sha256_crypt.encrypt(str(form.password.data))\n\n        db = get_db()\n        cursor = db.cursor()\n        cursor.execute(\"INSERT INTO users(name,email,username,password) VALUES(?,?,?,?)\", \n                       (name, email, username, password))\n        db.commit()\n    \n    return \"User registered successfully\"  # Or render a template, etc.\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- **`get_db()`**: This function checks if there's already a database connection for the current request and creates one if it doesn't exist.\n- **`close_db()`**: This function ensures that the database connection is closed after the request is done.\n- **Use `g`**: This ensures that each request gets its own database connection.\n\nBy using these practices, you should be able to avoid the threading issues with SQLite in Flask."
