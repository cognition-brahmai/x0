        "content": "In a Django REST Framework (DRF) application, handling CSRF tokens is a bit different compared to traditional Django templates because you are dealing with APIs and often working with frontend frameworks like React or React Native. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to incorporate and manage CSRF tokens in such a setup:\n\n### 1. CSRF in Django REST Framework\n\nBy default, Django's CSRF protection is enabled, but it only applies to views that use session-based authentication. If you're using token-based authentication, CSRF protection is not applicable because tokens are expected to be sent in headers.\n\nHowever, if you're using session authentication or want to enforce CSRF protection, you can follow these steps:\n\n### 2. Setting Up CSRF Token Handling\n\n#### Backend (Django)\n\n1. **Ensure CSRF Middleware is Active:**\n\n   Make sure the `CsrfViewMiddleware` is included in your `MIDDLEWARE` settings in `settings.py`. It is usually enabled by default.\n\n   ```python\n   MIDDLEWARE = [\n       ...\n       'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',\n       ...\n   ]\n   ```\n\n2. **Expose the CSRF Token to the Client:**\n\n   Create an endpoint that returns the CSRF token. This can be done using Django's `get_token` function.\n\n   ```python\n   from django.views.decorators.csrf import ensure_csrf_cookie\n   from django.http import JsonResponse\n   from django.middleware.csrf import get_token\n\n   @ensure_csrf_cookie\n   def get_csrf_token(request):\n       return JsonResponse({'csrfToken': get_token(request)})\n   ```\n\n   Add this view to your `urls.py`.\n\n3. **Configure CORS:**\n\n   If your React app is served from a different domain, ensure CORS is correctly configured. You can use `django-cors-headers` to manage CORS.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install django-cors-headers\n   ```\n\n   Add `'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware'` to your `MIDDLEWARE` and configure it in your `settings.py`.\n\n   ```python\n   INSTALLED_APPS = [\n       ...\n       'corsheaders',\n       ...\n   ]\n\n   CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [\n       \"http://localhost:3000\",  # React app URL\n       ...\n   ]\n   ```\n\n#### Frontend (React/React Native)\n\n1. **Fetch the CSRF Token:**\n\n   When your app initializes, make a request to the endpoint you created to get the CSRF token.\n\n   ```javascript\n   async function fetchCsrfToken() {\n       const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8000/get-csrf-token/', {\n           credentials: 'include',  // Important to include cookies\n       });\n       const data = await response.json();\n       return data.csrfToken;\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Include CSRF Token in Requests:**\n\n   When making POST, PUT, DELETE requests, include the CSRF token in the headers.\n\n   ```javascript\n   async function postData(url = '', data = {}) {\n       const csrfToken = await fetchCsrfToken();\n       const response = await fetch(url, {\n           method: 'POST',\n           credentials: 'include',  // Include cookies for authentication\n           headers: {\n               'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n               'X-CSRFToken': csrfToken,  // Include the CSRF token\n           },\n           body: JSON.stringify(data),\n       });\n       return response.json();\n   }\n   ```\n\n### 3. Testing and Debugging\n\n- **Cross-Domain Requests:** Always ensure your requests include `credentials: 'include'` to send cookies.\n- **CSRF Token Errors:** Check if the CSRF token is being correctly set in cookies and headers.\n- **Network Tab:** Use browser developer tools to inspect requests and responses to ensure the CSRF token is included.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to manage CSRF tokens in a Django REST Framework and React/React Native application, similar to how it's handled in traditional Django templates."
