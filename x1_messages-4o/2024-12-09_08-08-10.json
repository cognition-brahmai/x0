I am using `driver.find_element_by_class_name('pagination-r').click()` for this task, which works for most pages, but for some it throws an error - `WebDriverException: Message: Element is not clickable at point (918, 13). Other element would receive the click: <div class=\"linkAuchan\"></div>`. This error occurs consistently on one specific page. I have tried the solution from a related question involving `action_chains`, but I am still encountering the same error. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering typically happens when another element is overlapping or obscuring the clickable element, preventing Selenium from interacting with it as expected. Here are a few strategies you can try to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Wait for Element Visibility**: Ensure that the \"Next Page\" button is fully loaded and visible before attempting to click it. You can use `WebDriverWait` to wait for the element to become clickable.\n\n    ```python\n    from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By\n    from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait\n    from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC\n\n    wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10)\n    next_button = wait.until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.CLASS_NAME, 'pagination-r')))\n    next_button.click()\n    ```\n\n2. **Scroll the Element into View**: Sometimes, scrolling the element into view can solve the issue if it's being covered by another element due to scrolling.\n\n    ```python\n    next_button = driver.find_element_by_class_name('pagination-r')\n    driver.execute_script(\"arguments[0].scrollIntoView();\", next_button)\n    next_button.click()\n    ```\n\n3. **Click Using JavaScript**: If the above solutions don't work, you can try clicking the button using JavaScript, which can bypass some of the limitations of the standard Selenium click method.\n\n    ```python\n    next_button = driver.find_element_by_class_name('pagination-r')\n    driver.execute_script(\"arguments[0].click();\", next_button)\n    ```\n\n4. **Check for Overlapping Elements**: Inspect the page to determine if there's an element that consistently overlaps the \"Next Page\" button. You might need to interact with or hide this element before clicking.\n\n5. **Try Different Locator Strategies**: If the class name is not unique or reliable, try using other locator strategies like ID, XPath, or CSS selectors.\n\n    ```python\n    next_button = driver.find_element_by_xpath(\"//button[contains(@class, 'pagination-r')]\")\n    next_button.click()\n    ```\n\n6. **Action Chains**: If you've tried using `ActionChains` and it didn't work, ensure you are correctly moving to the element before clicking.\n\n    ```python\n    from selenium.webdriver.common.action_chains import ActionChains\n\n    next_button = driver.find_element_by_class_name('pagination-r')\n    actions = ActionChains(driver)\n    actions.move_to_element(next_button).click().perform()\n    ```\n\n7. **Verify Z-Index and Style**: Inspect the CSS to see if any style, such as `z-index`, might be causing the button to be behind another element. You might need to adjust styles dynamically using JavaScript.\n\nIf none of these solutions work, consider providing additional context or code snippets to further diagnose the issue."
