        "content": "I am working on an animation system where I am using a Neural Network to create behaviors for the engine. The neural network takes in 3 vector3s and 1 Euler angle for every body part that I have. Each body part has 3 floats and I have 7 body parts, hence, I have 84 inputs for my neural network. The outputs are mapped to the muscles of the character, providing the amount of strength to apply to each muscle, with 15 such muscles. I am running 15 networks simultaneously for 10 seconds, rating their fitness by calculating the lowest energy use, having the least amount of z and x movement, and if the body parts are in the correct y position in relation to the rest. Then, these are run through a genetic algorithm. I was operating a neural network of 168 neurons per hidden layer, with 8 hidden layers, for 3000 generations but I didn't get the desired results. The neural network and genetic algorithm are C# versions of a tutorial I followed, where I changed the crossover method from one point to blending. Given that I have 84 inputs and 15 outputs, how large should my Neural Network be?"

        "content": "Designing an effective neural network for your animation system involves several considerations, especially when you're aiming for a specific behavior and performance. Given your setup, let's break down the key factors:\n\n1. **Input and Output Size**: You have 84 inputs and 15 outputs. The network must effectively capture the relationship between inputs and outputs.\n\n2. **Network Architecture**:\n   - **Hidden Layers and Neurons**: Your current architecture with 8 hidden layers of 168 neurons each is quite large. Generally, the complexity of the network should match the complexity of the task. If the network is too large, it might lead to overfitting, where the network learns the training data but doesn't generalize well to new data.\n   - Consider reducing the number of hidden layers. Start with 2-4 hidden layers and see if this improves performance. Adjust the number of neurons per layer based on experimentation.\n   - A good starting point could be using fewer neurons in the first hidden layer (e.g., 100-150) and gradually decreasing the number in subsequent layers.\n\n3. **Activation Functions**: Ensure you are using appropriate activation functions. Common choices for hidden layers are ReLU or its variants (Leaky ReLU, Parametric ReLU), and for the output layer, consider using a linear activation function or something domain-specific if needed.\n\n4. **Crossover Method**: You mentioned switching to blending for crossover. Different crossover methods can impact how well solutions evolve. Ensure that your blending method maintains enough diversity in the population. Consider trying other crossover techniques like uniform crossover or experimenting with mutation rates to maintain diversity.\n\n5. **Fitness Function**: Make sure that the fitness function aligns well with the desired behavior. Sometimes tweaking the fitness criteria or weighting them differently can lead to better results.\n\n6. **Regularization**: To avoid overfitting and help the network generalize better, consider techniques like dropout or L2 regularization.\n\n7. **Learning Rate and Optimization**: Experiment with different learning rates and optimization algorithms (like Adam, RMSprop) to see which works best for your setup.\n\n8. **Training Time and Generations**: If you're not seeing desired results after 3000 generations, it might be worth analyzing the learning progress over time. If the fitness scores plateau early, it might indicate the need for architectural changes or tuning hyperparameters.\n\n9. **Data Preprocessing**: Ensure that your input data is properly normalized or standardized as this can significantly impact the network's ability to learn.\n\n10. **Experiment and Iterate**: Machine learning often requires iterative experimentation. Try different configurations and keep track of changes and results to understand what impacts performance the most.\n\nIn conclusion, start with a simpler architecture and gradually increase complexity as needed. Use systematic experimentation to find the optimal network design and parameters."
