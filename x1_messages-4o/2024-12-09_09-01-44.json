        "content": "To generate a C++ code that lists out the values of a 2D array, you can use nested loops to iterate through the rows and columns of the array. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to do this:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    // Define a 2D array with some example values\n    const int rows = 3;\n    const int cols = 4;\n    int array[rows][cols] = {\n        {1, 2, 3, 4},\n        {5, 6, 7, 8},\n        {9, 10, 11, 12}\n    };\n\n    // Iterate through the 2D array and print each element\n    std::cout << \"The values of the 2D array are:\" << std::endl;\n    for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < cols; ++j) {\n            std::cout << array[i][j] << \" \";\n        }\n        std::cout << std::endl; // Move to the next line after each row\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Array Declaration**: The 2D array `array` is declared with 3 rows and 4 columns, and it's initialized with some example values.\n\n2. **Nested Loops**: \n   - The outer loop (`for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i)`) iterates over each row.\n   - The inner loop (`for (int j = 0; j < cols; ++j)`) iterates over each column within the current row.\n\n3. **Output**: Each element of the array is printed followed by a space, and after each row, a newline is printed to format the output correctly.\n\nThis program will output the elements of the 2D array in a tabular format, making it easy to read and understand. You can adjust the size of the array and its initial values as needed for your specific use case."
