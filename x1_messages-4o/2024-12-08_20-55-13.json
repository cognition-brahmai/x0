Here's a query using a SQL database that accomplishes this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT e.name, m.place, m.date\nFROM employees e\nJOIN meetings m ON e.employee_id = m.employee_id;\n```\n\nThis query uses an INNER JOIN to combine rows from the \"employees\" table and the \"meetings\" table based on the matching \"employee_id\" column. It then selects the \"name\" from the \"employees\" table and the \"place\" and \"date\" from the \"meetings\" table to provide the desired information."
