Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\noriginal_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ncopied_array = [element for element in original_array]\n```\n\nThis line creates a new list, `copied_array`, containing all the elements from `original_array`. This is a concise and efficient way to duplicate a list in Python."
