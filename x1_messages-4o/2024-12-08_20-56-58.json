        "content": "To achieve the tasks you mentioned using MATLAB, we need to make some corrections and improvements in the code.\n\n1. **Finding the Roots**: Your code for finding the roots using symbolic variables is mostly correct, but we'll ensure that it's clear and complete.\n\n2. **Plotting the Function**: We'll use `fplot` instead of `ezplot` since `ezplot` is not recommended for newer MATLAB versions.\n\n3. **Calculating the Area Under the Curve**: We'll use the `integral` function correctly with a function handle to compute the area.\n\n4. **Customizing the Plot**: We'll use `fill` to shade the area under the curve in blue and `plot` to draw the curve with a red dashed line.\n\nHere's how you can modify and complete your code:\n\n```matlab\n% Define the symbolic variable and function\nsyms x\nf = 2*x^3 - 7*x^2 + 8*x + 5;\n\n% Find the roots of the equation\nroots = solve(f == 0, x);\ndisp('Roots of the equation:');\ndisp(double(roots));\n\n% Define the function handle for numerical integration and plotting\nf_numeric = matlabFunction(f);\n\n% Calculate the area under the curve from x=0 to x=5\narea = integral(f_numeric, 0, 5);\ndisp('Area under the curve from x=0 to x=5:');\ndisp(area);\n\n% Plot the function with customized appearance\nfigure;\nfplot(f_numeric, [0, 5], 'r--', 'LineWidth', 1.5); % Red dashed line\nhold on;\n\n% Fill the area under the curve\nx_fill = linspace(0, 5, 100);\ny_fill = f_numeric(x_fill);\nfill([x_fill, fliplr(x_fill)], [y_fill, zeros(size(y_fill))], 'b', 'FaceAlpha', 0.3, 'EdgeColor', 'none');\n\n% Add labels and title\nxlabel('x');\nylabel('f(x)');\ntitle('Plot of f(x) = 2x^3 - 7x^2 + 8x + 5');\nlegend('f(x)', 'Area under curve', 'Location', 'Best');\n\nhold off;\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Roots Calculation**: Using `solve(f == 0, x)` finds the roots correctly. We convert them to numerical values using `double()` for display.\n\n- **Numerical Integration**: The `integral` function requires a function handle, which is created using `matlabFunction(f)`.\n\n- **Plot Customization**: \n  - `fplot` is used for plotting the function with a specified line style.\n  - `fill` is used to shade the area under the curve. The `FaceAlpha` property is set to make the shading semi-transparent.\n  - Legends, labels, and titles are added for clarity.\n\nThis code will help you analyze the function graphically and calculate the desired area under the curve."
