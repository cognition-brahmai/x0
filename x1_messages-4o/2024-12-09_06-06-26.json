Here is how you can do it when importing data from a CSV file:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the CSV file into a DataFrame\ndf = pd.read_csv('your_file.csv')\n\n# Replace '(' and ')' with '_' in all column names\ndf.columns = df.columns.str.replace('(', '_').str.replace(')', '_')\n\n# Now you can work with your DataFrame with updated column names\nprint(df.head())\n```\n\nThis code snippet reads a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame and uses the `str.replace()` method to replace all occurrences of '(' and ')' with underscores '_' in the column names. The `str.replace()` method is applied twice to handle each character individually."
