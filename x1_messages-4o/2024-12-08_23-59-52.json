Additionally, the expression must include at least one trigonometric function and one logarithmic function. The expression should also be written in Latex format and must be executable in Python using the SymPy library. Finally, provide a table showing the values of the expression for x ranging from -10 to 10, inclusive."

        "content": "To construct a mathematical expression using the given numbers 3, 8, and 10, while including a trigonometric function and a logarithmic function, we can create the following expression:\n\n\\[ f(x) = 3 \\cdot \\sin(x) + \\log_8(x + 11) + 10 \\]\n\nThis expression satisfies the conditions: it uses the numbers 3, 8, and 10, and includes both a trigonometric function (\\(\\sin\\)) and a logarithmic function (\\(\\log_8\\)). We add 11 inside the logarithm to ensure the argument remains positive over the given range.\n\nWe'll use the SymPy library in Python to evaluate this expression for \\( x \\) ranging from -10 to 10. Here's the Python code to compute and display the table of values:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variable and expression\nx = sp.symbols('x')\nexpression = 3 * sp.sin(x) + sp.log(x + 11, 8) + 10\n\n# Create a table of values\ntable = []\nfor value in range(-10, 11):\n    result = expression.subs(x, value).evalf()\n    table.append((value, result))\n\n# Print the table\nprint(\"x\\tf(x)\")\nfor value, result in table:\n    print(f\"{value}\\t{result}\")\n```\n\nThis code uses SymPy to evaluate the expression \\( f(x) \\) for each integer value of \\( x \\) from -10 to 10 and prints the results in a table format.\n\nNote: The expression \\( f(x) \\) is evaluated using a base-8 logarithm, which is specified in SymPy using the `log` function with a second argument for the base."
