        "content": "I have two datetime objects, Alpha_TimeObj and Beta_TimeObj. I need to calculate the timedelta between them to get Turnaround_TimeObj. I want to format the output of this timedelta, for example, \"2 days, 22:13:45\" into a specific format using strftime function. However, I am unable to do so. Additionally, when I try to convert the timedelta to seconds and then use divmod to get the required formatting, it doesn't seem to work either as it's ignoring the \"day\" value. Is there a way to format a timedelta object in a single line using any datetime function?"

        "content": "The `timedelta` object in Python doesn't directly support the `strftime` method, which is typically used with `datetime` objects. However, you can format a `timedelta` object by manually calculating the days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Here's how you can achieve that in a single line using a formatted string:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Example datetime objects\nAlpha_TimeObj = datetime(2023, 10, 20, 14, 30, 0)\nBeta_TimeObj = datetime(2023, 10, 18, 16, 16, 15)\n\n# Calculate the timedelta\nTurnaround_TimeObj = Alpha_TimeObj - Beta_TimeObj\n\n# Format the timedelta into \"X days, HH:MM:SS\"\nformatted_timedelta = f\"{Turnaround_TimeObj.days} days, \" \\\n                      f\"{(Turnaround_TimeObj.seconds // 3600):02}:{(Turnaround_TimeObj.seconds % 3600 // 60):02}:\" \\\n                      f\"{(Turnaround_TimeObj.seconds % 60):02}\"\n\nprint(formatted_timedelta)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1. `Turnaround_TimeObj.days` gives you the number of days.\n2. `Turnaround_TimeObj.seconds` gives you the total number of seconds in the remaining time (after accounting for days).\n3. You can then use integer division and modulo operations to extract hours, minutes, and seconds from the total seconds.\n\nThis approach manually formats the `timedelta` object into a specific string format, closely mimicking what you might achieve with `strftime` if it were available for `timedelta`."
