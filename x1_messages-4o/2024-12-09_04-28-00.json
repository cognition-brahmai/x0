Currently, I am using the following two methods:\n\nMethod 1:\n```python\ns += stringfromelsewhere\n```\nMethod 2:\n```python\ns = []\ns.append(somestring)\n\n# later\ns = ''.join(s)\n```\nI found an article discussing this topic, but it is written for Python 2.x. Did anything change regarding string concatenation in Python 3?"

        "content": "In Python, strings are indeed immutable, which means that every time you concatenate strings using the `+` operator or `+=`, a new string is created, and this can be inefficient if done repeatedly in a loop or with a large number of strings.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the efficiency of the methods you mentioned and other alternatives:\n\n### Method 1: Using `+=`\n\n- **Inefficient for Large Concatenations:** Each use of `+=` creates a new string, which can be costly in terms of performance when done repeatedly, especially inside loops.\n  \n### Method 2: Using `list` and `''.join()`\n\n- **Efficient and Recommended:** This method is generally more efficient for concatenating many strings. By using a list to collect strings and then using `''.join(list)`, you reduce the overhead of creating new strings repeatedly. This is because lists are mutable, and appending to a list is much more efficient than concatenating strings directly.\n  \n### Other Considerations and Alternatives:\n\n1. **Using `str.join()` Directly:**\n   If you have an iterable of strings, you can directly use `''.join(iterable)`, which is efficient and concise.\n\n2. **StringIO:**\n   If you're dealing with a very large number of string concatenations, `io.StringIO` can be used as it provides a file-like object for strings, allowing you to write strings and then get the value.\n\n   ```python\n   from io import StringIO\n\n   output = StringIO()\n   output.write(\"Hello\")\n   output.write(\"World\")\n   result = output.getvalue()\n   output.close()\n   ```\n\n3. **Using f-Strings or `.format()` for Smaller Concatenations:**\n   For smaller or more readable concatenations, you can use f-strings (Python 3.6+) or `.format()`, although these are not particularly optimized for performance if used in loops.\n\n   ```python\n   # f-string example\n   name = \"World\"\n   greeting = f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n\n   # format method\n   greeting = \"Hello, {}\".format(name)\n   ```\n\n### Changes in Python 3:\n\nWhile the general principles of string concatenation efficiency remain largely the same between Python 2 and Python 3, Python 3 introduced several features like f-strings for more readable string formatting. However, the underlying efficiency considerations regarding string immutability and the use of lists or `StringIO` for efficient concatenation haven't changed significantly.\n\nFor most cases involving large-scale string concatenation, using a list to gather strings and `''.join()` them at the end remains the best practice in Python 3."
