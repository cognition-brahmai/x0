        "content": "To calculate the total sum of a list of numbers in Python, you can use the built-in `sum()` function. Given a list like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, you would do the following:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ntotal_sum = sum(numbers)\nprint(\"Total sum:\", total_sum)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nTotal sum: 15\n```\n\nTo compute the pairwise averages, you can use a list comprehension. For each pair of consecutive numbers, calculate the average and store it in a new list. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\npairwise_averages = [(numbers[i] + numbers[i + 1]) / 2 for i in range(len(numbers) - 1)]\nprint(\"Pairwise averages:\", pairwise_averages)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nPairwise averages: [1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5]\n```\n\nIn the list comprehension, `range(len(numbers) - 1)` ensures that you only iterate up to the second-to-last element, as you are accessing `numbers[i + 1]` for each `i`."
