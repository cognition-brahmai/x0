        "content": "To generate a secure and unique secret code word using Ruby, you can follow a multi-step approach that involves using a cryptographic hashing algorithm combined with random salt generation. This ensures both uniqueness and confidentiality. Here's a detailed code snippet and explanation using Ruby:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'securerandom'\nrequire 'digest'\n\ndef generate_secure_code_word\n  # Step 1: Generate a random secret code word\n  secret_code_word = SecureRandom.hex(16) # Generates a random 32-character hexadecimal string\n\n  # Step 2: Generate a random salt\n  salt = SecureRandom.hex(16) # Generates a random 32-character hexadecimal string as salt\n\n  # Step 3: Combine the secret code word and salt\n  combined_string = \"#{secret_code_word}#{salt}\"\n\n  # Step 4: Hash the combined string using a secure hashing algorithm (SHA-256)\n  hashed_code_word = Digest::SHA256.hexdigest(combined_string)\n\n  # Step 5: Return the hashed code word and salt\n  { hashed_code_word: hashed_code_word, salt: salt }\nend\n\n# Example usage\nresult = generate_secure_code_word\nputs \"Hashed Code Word: #{result[:hashed_code_word]}\"\nputs \"Salt: #{result[:salt]}\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Random Secret Code Word**: We start by generating a random secret code word using `SecureRandom.hex(16)`. This generates a 32-character hexadecimal string, which is effectively a 128-bit random number. This randomness is crucial for ensuring the code word is unique and unpredictable.\n\n2. **Random Salt Generation**: A salt is an additional random value that is used to ensure that the hash of the same secret code word is different each time. This makes it difficult for attackers to use precomputed hash tables (rainbow tables) to crack hashed values. We generate a random salt using `SecureRandom.hex(16)`.\n\n3. **Combining Secret Code Word and Salt**: The secret code word and the salt are combined into a single string. This combination is what will be hashed, adding an extra layer of security.\n\n4. **Hashing with SHA-256**: We use the SHA-256 hashing algorithm from the `Digest` module to hash the combined string. SHA-256 is a widely used cryptographic hash function that produces a 256-bit (64-character) hash, providing a high level of security.\n\n5. **Return Values**: The method returns a hash containing the `hashed_code_word` and the `salt`. The salt must be stored alongside the hashed code word, as it will be needed for future verification processes.\n\nThis approach ensures that the generated secret code word is both secure and unique, providing a robust solution for applications requiring high confidentiality and protection."
