Here's a simple query to achieve that:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS total_customers\nFROM customers;\n```\n\nThis query will return a single value representing the total number of rows (customers) in the `customers` table. The `AS total_customers` part is an alias that names the resulting column, making it easier to understand the result."
