Here is the code I am currently working with:\n\n```python\nc = c.annotate(metric=Sum('results__metric'))\nc = c.annotate(metric_prior=Sum('results__metric_prior'))\nc = c.annotate(variance=F('metric')-F('metric_prior')) #doesn't work, for demonstrative purposes only\n```\n\nThen, I want to order by the variance:\n\n```python\nc = c.order_by('variance')\n```\n\nHowever, this approach doesn't seem to be working. Could anyone suggest a way to accomplish this?"

        "content": "To sort on the aggregate of two annotated columns in Django, you need to ensure that your annotations are correctly defined and that the subtraction operation is performed correctly within the query. The issue with your code might be due to the way you've structured your annotations. You can use the `F` expression to perform arithmetic operations on annotated fields.\n\nHere's how you can accomplish this:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db.models import Sum, F, ExpressionWrapper, FloatField\n\n# Annotate the sum of the 'metric' and 'metric_prior' fields\nc = c.annotate(\n    metric=Sum('results__metric'),\n    metric_prior=Sum('results__metric_prior')\n)\n\n# Annotate the variance by subtracting the two annotated fields\nc = c.annotate(\n    variance=ExpressionWrapper(\n        F('metric') - F('metric_prior'),\n        output_field=FloatField()\n    )\n)\n\n# Order by the variance\nc = c.order_by('variance')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`ExpressionWrapper`**: This is used to wrap the arithmetic expression so that Django can interpret it correctly. This is necessary when performing arithmetic operations on annotated fields.\n\n2. **`FloatField()`**: Specifying the output field type as `FloatField()` ensures that the result of the arithmetic operation is treated as a float. This is important for sorting purposes, especially if your numbers might not be integers.\n\n3. **Ordering**: Finally, you order the queryset by the `variance`.\n\nThis setup should correctly annotate your queryset with the variance and allow you to order by it."
