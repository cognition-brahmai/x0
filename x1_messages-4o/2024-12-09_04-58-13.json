        "content": "Building Python from source on Ubuntu is a great way to customize your Python installation and resolve issues like the one you're facing. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. **Install Required Packages**: First, you need to install the necessary packages and libraries that are required to build Python from source.\n\n   Open a terminal and run the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev \\\n   libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev \\\n   libgdbm-dev libdb5.3-dev libbz2-dev libexpat1-dev liblzma-dev tk-dev\n   ```\n\n### Downloading Python Source Code\n\n2. **Download the Latest Source Code**: Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/) and download the latest release tarball of the Python source code.\n\n   Alternatively, you can use `wget` to download it directly from the terminal. For example, to download Python 3.10.0:\n\n   ```bash\n   wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.0/Python-3.10.0.tgz\n   ```\n\n3. **Extract the Tarball**: Extract the downloaded tarball.\n\n   ```bash\n   tar -xvf Python-3.10.0.tgz\n   ```\n\n### Building Python from Source\n\n4. **Navigate to the Python Directory**: Change into the directory you just extracted.\n\n   ```bash\n   cd Python-3.10.0\n   ```\n\n5. **Configure the Build Environment**: Run the `configure` script to prepare the build environment. This step will check your system for the dependencies needed to build Python.\n\n   ```bash\n   ./configure --enable-optimizations\n   ```\n\n   The `--enable-optimizations` flag is optional but recommended as it will enable additional optimizations, making your Python build faster.\n\n6. **Compile Python**: Start the build process. This step can take some time depending on your system's speed.\n\n   ```bash\n   make -j 4\n   ```\n\n   The `-j 4` flag tells `make` to use 4 CPU cores for the compilation process. You can adjust this number based on your CPU's core count.\n\n7. **Run Tests (Optional)**: It is a good idea to run the test suite to ensure everything has been built correctly.\n\n   ```bash\n   make test\n   ```\n\n8. **Install Python**: Once everything is built and tested, you can install it. You may need superuser privileges for this step.\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo make altinstall\n   ```\n\n   The `altinstall` target is used instead of `install` to prevent overwriting the default Python binary (`python`) in `/usr/bin/`.\n\n### Verifying the Installation\n\n9. **Verify the Installation**: Check that the newly installed Python version is working correctly.\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.10 --version\n   ```\n\n   This should output the version of Python you just installed.\n\n### Additional Steps\n\n- **Update Alternatives**: If you want to switch the default Python version used by the `python3` command, you can update the alternatives system:\n\n  ```bash\n  sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/local/bin/python3.10 1\n  ```\n\nThat's it! You should now have a custom-built version of Python installed on your Ubuntu system. This setup will help you address the specific issue you were facing with the external `pyexpat` implementation. If you encounter any issues during the build process, feel free to ask for help."
