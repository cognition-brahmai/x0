        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to a misunderstanding of how the `list.reverse()` method works in Python. Here's a breakdown of what's happening in your code:\n\n1. `str_a.split()` splits the string into a list of words, so `rev_word` becomes `['This', 'is', 'string']`.\n\n2. `rev_word.reverse()` is a list method that reverses the elements of the list **in place** and returns `None`. This means that after calling `reverse()`, `rev_word` is still `['string', 'is', 'This']`, but the method itself does not return the reversed list; it returns `None`.\n\n3. When you attempt to use `''.join(rev_word)`, you are actually trying to join `None`, which is why you get a `TypeError`. The intended list `['string', 'is', 'This']` is not being joined because `rev_word` is `None` after the reverse operation.\n\nTo fix this, you should reverse the list and then join it without reassigning the result of `reverse()`. Here's how you can correct the code:\n\n```python\nstr_a = 'This is string'\nrev_word = str_a.split()\nrev_word.reverse()  # This reverses the list in place\nrev_word = ' '.join(rev_word)  # Join the reversed list back into a string\n```\n\nAfter these changes, `rev_word` will correctly hold the value `'string is This'`."
