Below is an example code that generates a thank-you note for your mentor, Rohan Sharma, and includes a personalized message of appreciation:\n\n```matlab\n% Define the mentor's name\nmentorName = 'Rohan Sharma';\n\n% Create a personalized message of appreciation\nappreciationMessage = ['Dear ', mentorName, ',\\n\\n', ...\n    'I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude for all the guidance and support you have provided me. ', ...\n    'Your mentorship has been invaluable in my journey, and I am truly grateful for all the wisdom you have shared.\\n\\n', ...\n    'Thank you once again for being such an inspiring mentor.\\n\\n', ...\n    'Sincerely,\\n', ...\n    'Your Name'];\n\n% Display the thank-you message\nfprintf(appreciationMessage);\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the code:\n- The `mentorName` variable is assigned the name \"Rohan Sharma\".\n- The `appreciationMessage` variable is constructed to include the mentor's name and a personalized message.\n- The `fprintf` function is used to display the formatted thank-you message in the MATLAB command window.\n\nYou can modify the message content as needed to better suit your style and add any additional details you would like to include."
