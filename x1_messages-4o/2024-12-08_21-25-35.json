Over the years, the company has implemented various measures to minimize its carbon footprint and waste generation. Can you calculate the percentage reduction in Heavy Machinery's carbon emissions from 2008 to 2018? Assume that the company's carbon emissions in 2008 were 5,000 metric tons and in 2018, they were 3,500 metric tons."
