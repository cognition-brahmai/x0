In Python 2, the `urllib` module is structured differently. Here's how you can work with similar functionality in Python 2.7:\n\nInstead of using `urllib.request` as you would in Python 3, you can use the `urllib2` module in Python 2. Here's how you can perform similar tasks:\n\nFor opening URLs:\n```python\nimport urllib2\n\nresponse = urllib2.urlopen('http://www.example.com')\nhtml = response.read()\nprint(html)\n```\n\nFor handling URLs with additional features like headers:\n```python\nimport urllib2\n\nrequest = urllib2.Request('http://www.example.com')\nresponse = urllib2.urlopen(request)\nhtml = response.read()\nprint(html)\n```\n\nIf you are starting a new project, it's recommended to use Python 3, as Python 2 is no longer officially supported. This would allow you to use `urllib.request` and other updated libraries that are only available in Python 3.\n\nIf you want to keep using a modern codebase but are constrained to Python 2, consider using the `six` library, which provides compatibility between Python 2 and 3:\n\n```python\nimport six\nfrom six.moves import urllib\n\nresponse = urllib.request.urlopen('http://www.example.com')\nhtml = response.read()\nprint(html)\n```\n\nThis will allow you to write code that's more forward-compatible with Python 3."
