        "content": "To extract the HTTP message body using the `do_POST()` method in the `BaseHTTPRequestHandler` class, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Content Length**: The body of a POST request is accessible via the input stream. The length of this stream is specified by the `Content-Length` header, so you need to read this header first.\n\n2. **Read the Body**: Use the `rfile` attribute to read the body from the input stream, based on the content length.\n\nHere is an example of how you can implement this in your `do_POST()` method:\n\n```python\nfrom http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer\n\nclass MyHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n    def do_POST(self):\n        # Get the content length to determine the size of the body\n        content_length = int(self.headers['Content-Length'])\n        \n        # Read the body of the POST request\n        post_body = self.rfile.read(content_length)\n        \n        # If the body is in bytes, decode it to a string\n        post_body = post_body.decode('utf-8')\n\n        # Print the body or process it as needed\n        print(\"POST Body:\")\n        print(post_body)\n\n        # Send a simple response back\n        self.send_response(200)\n        self.send_header('Content-type', 'text/html')\n        self.end_headers()\n        self.wfile.write(b'Received POST request')\n\ndef run(server_class=HTTPServer, handler_class=MyHandler, port=8080):\n    server_address = ('', port)\n    httpd = server_class(server_address, handler_class)\n    print(f'Starting server on port {port}...')\n    httpd.serve_forever()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    run()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **`self.headers['Content-Length']`**: This retrieves the length of the request body.\n- **`self.rfile.read(content_length)`**: Reads the specified number of bytes from the input stream.\n- **Decoding**: If your body is in a specific format (e.g., JSON), you'll need to decode it appropriately. Here, it's decoded as UTF-8 for demonstration.\n\nThis method will allow you to access and handle the body of a POST request in your HTTP server application."
