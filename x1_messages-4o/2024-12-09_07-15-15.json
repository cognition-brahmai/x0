The bytes should be fairly random and the size of the bytearray could vary from a few KBs to several MBs. I want to avoid iterating byte-by-byte due to the slow performance. I am aiming for a performance similar to numpy.random but I do not have the numpy module available for this project. Is there a way to do this with a standard Python install or will I need to compile my own using C? I've done some timings for context:\n\n```python\n>>> timeit.timeit('[random.randint(0,128) for i in xrange(1,100000)]',setup='import random', number=100)\n35.73110193696641\n>>> timeit.timeit('numpy.random.random_integers(0,128,100000)',setup='import numpy', number=100)\n0.5785652013481126\n>>> \n```"

        "content": "If you're looking for a way to generate a large bytearray of random bytes without using numpy and want to avoid iterating byte-by-byte for performance reasons, you can leverage Python's `os.urandom()` function, which generates cryptographically secure random bytes. This function is both efficient and part of the standard library, so you won't need any additional modules.\n\nHere's how you can use `os.urandom()` to generate a bytearray of a specific size:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef generate_random_bytearray(size):\n    return bytearray(os.urandom(size))\n\n# Example usage\nsize_in_bytes = 1000000  # Adjust the size as needed\nrandom_bytearray = generate_random_bytearray(size_in_bytes)\n```\n\nThe `os.urandom()` function is efficient and suitable for generating large blocks of random data quickly. Since it pulls random data directly from the operating system's randomness source, it avoids the overhead of generating numbers one-by-one within Python. This should give you performance closer to what you experience with `numpy.random`.\n\nIf you need to generate random integers within a specific range (e.g., between 0 and 128), you could post-process the bytearray. However, keep in mind that this might add some additional overhead:\n\n```python\ndef generate_random_bytearray_in_range(size, min_value=0, max_value=128):\n    random_bytes = os.urandom(size)\n    return bytearray((min_value + (byte % (max_value - min_value + 1))) for byte in random_bytes)\n\n# Example usage\nsize_in_bytes = 1000000  # Adjust the size as needed\nrandom_bytearray_in_range = generate_random_bytearray_in_range(size_in_bytes)\n```\n\nThis approach should give you a good balance between randomness, range, and performance without needing to resort to external libraries or custom C extensions."
