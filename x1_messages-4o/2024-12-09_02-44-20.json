My folder structure looks like this:\n\n```\nsrc\\\n  main.py\n  dirFoo\\\n    __init__.py\n    foofactory.py\n    dirFoo1\\\n      __init__.py\n      foo1.py\n    dirFoo2\\\n      __init__.py\n      foo2.py\n```\n\nIn my main.py script, I am importing `FooFactory` from `dirFoo.foofactory` like so:\n\n```\nfrom dirFoo.foofactory import FooFactory\n```\n\nIn the `foofactory.py` file, I am importing the submodules `Foo1` and `Foo2` from `dirFoo1.foo1` and `dirFoo2.foo2` respectively:\n\n```\nfrom dirFoo1.foo1 import Foo1\nfrom dirFoo2.foo2 import Foo2\n```\n\nHowever, when I call `foofactory` I get an ImportError that python can't import the submodules `foo1` and `foo2`. The error message is as follows:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Users/tmp/src/main.py\", line 1, in <module>\nfrom dirFoo.foofactory import FooFactory\n  File \"/Users/tmp/src/dirFoo/foofactory.py\", line 1, in <module>\nfrom dirFoo1.foo1 import Foo1\nImportError: No module named dirFoo1.foo1\n```\n\nHow can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The `ImportError` you are encountering is likely due to the way Python handles module paths. When you attempt to import `dirFoo1.foo1` and `dirFoo2.foo2` in `foofactory.py`, Python is looking for these modules relative to the current working directory or in the Python path.\n\nHere are a few ways to resolve this issue:\n\n### Method 1: Relative Imports\nIf `foofactory.py` is meant to be run as part of the `dirFoo` package, you can use relative imports. Adjust your imports in `foofactory.py` to be relative:\n\n```python\nfrom .dirFoo1.foo1 import Foo1\nfrom .dirFoo2.foo2 import Foo2\n```\n\nThis assumes that `foofactory.py` will always be executed as part of the package (i.e., not directly as a script), so it should be run in the context of the `src` package.\n\n### Method 2: Modify the `PYTHONPATH`\nAnother solution is to add the `src` directory to your `PYTHONPATH`. This can be done temporarily in your terminal session:\n\nOn MacOS/Linux:\n```bash\nexport PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/your/src\n```\n\nOn Windows:\n```cmd\nset PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\\path\\to\\your\\src\n```\n\nOr, you can add a `.pth` file in your `site-packages` directory that includes the path to your `src` directory.\n\n### Method 3: Use Absolute Imports with Adjusted Directory\nIf you're running `main.py` directly, ensure that you are executing it from the `src` directory level. This way, absolute imports should work as expected assuming `src` is in your `PYTHONPATH`.\n\n### Method 4: Use a Package Manager\nConsider using a package manager like `pip` to install your module in editable mode, which will handle the path issues for you:\n\n```bash\ncd /path/to/your/src\npip install -e .\n```\n\n### Method 5: Run as a Module\nYou can run your script using the `-m` flag to specify the module location:\n\n```bash\npython -m src.main\n```\n\nThis will treat `src` as a package, allowing your imports to resolve correctly.\n\nChoose the method that best fits your development setup. If you want to ensure your code works regardless of the environment, using relative imports is a common practice within packages."
