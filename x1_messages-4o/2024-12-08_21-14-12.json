        "content": "Certainly! Implementing a binary search in MATLAB is straightforward. Here's a sample code that demonstrates how to perform a binary search on a sorted array:\n\n```matlab\nfunction index = binarySearch(arr, target)\n    % Initialize the left and right bounds of the search\n    left = 1;\n    right = length(arr);\n    \n    % While the search space is not empty\n    while left <= right\n        % Find the middle index\n        middle = floor((left + right) / 2);\n        \n        % Check if the target is at the middle\n        if arr(middle) == target\n            index = middle;\n            return;\n        % If the target is smaller than the middle element, search the left half\n        elseif arr(middle) > target\n            right = middle - 1;\n        % If the target is larger than the middle element, search the right half\n        else\n            left = middle + 1;\n        end\n    end\n    \n    % If the target is not found, return -1\n    index = -1;\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- **Initialization**: Begin by setting `left` to the start (1) and `right` to the end (length of the array) of the array.\n- **Loop**: Continue the loop while `left` is less than or equal to `right`.\n- **Middle Calculation**: Calculate the middle index of the current search space using `floor((left + right) / 2)`.\n- **Comparison**:\n  - If the middle element is equal to the target, return the middle index.\n  - If the middle element is greater than the target, adjust the search space to the left half by setting `right` to `middle - 1`.\n  - If the middle element is less than the target, adjust the search space to the right half by setting `left` to `middle + 1`.\n- **Not Found**: If the loop exits without finding the target, return -1 indicating the target is not present.\n\n### Time and Space Complexity:\n- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the binary search algorithm is \\(O(\\log n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of elements in the array. This is because the algorithm halves the search space with each iteration.\n- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \\(O(1)\\) because the algorithm uses a constant amount of space regardless of the input size. It only requires a few variables to hold the indices and the target value.\n\nFeel free to use this code to perform binary searches on sorted arrays in MATLAB!"
