        "content": "The warning message you're encountering indicates that there is a version mismatch between the `requests` library and its dependencies, `urllib3` and `chardet`. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Installed Versions**: First, check the versions of `requests`, `urllib3`, and `chardet` that are currently installed. You can do this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip show requests urllib3 chardet\n   ```\n\n2. **Upgrade All Packages**: Try upgrading all three packages to the latest versions. You can do this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade requests urllib3 chardet\n   ```\n\n3. **Ensure Compatibility**: Make sure that the versions are compatible with each other. As of October 2023, the following versions are generally compatible:\n\n   - `requests`: 2.28.0 or later\n   - `urllib3`: Compatible versions are usually listed in the `requests` documentation or release notes.\n   - `chardet`: Compatible versions are usually listed in the `requests` documentation or release notes.\n\n4. **Check Python Version**: Since the warning message references Python 2.7, consider upgrading your Python version if possible, as Python 2.7 has reached end-of-life and is no longer officially supported. Python 3.x is recommended.\n\n5. **Virtual Environment**: If you're not already using a virtual environment, consider creating one. This will help manage dependencies separately from the system Python packages, reducing the risk of version conflicts:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n   pip install requests urllib3 chardet\n   ```\n\n6. **Specific Version Installation**: If upgrading doesn't resolve the issue, try installing specific versions that are known to be compatible. For example:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests==2.28.0 urllib3==1.26.5 chardet==4.0.0\n   ```\n\n7. **Clear Pip Cache**: Sometimes clearing the pip cache can help if there are corrupted files:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip cache purge\n   ```\n\n8. **Reinstall Packages**: If none of the above steps work, try uninstalling and then reinstalling the packages:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall requests urllib3 chardet\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the dependency warning and get your code running smoothly."
