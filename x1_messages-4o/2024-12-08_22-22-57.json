The first and last digits are equal.\n4. The second and fourth digits are equal.\n\nLet's denote the number as \\(abcba\\), where:\n- \\(a\\) is the same digit in the first and last positions.\n- \\(b\\) is the same digit in the second and fourth positions.\n- \\(c\\) is the middle digit.\n\nGiven these conditions, we know:\n- The number is of the form \\(abcba\\).\n- All digits (\\(a, b, c\\)) are unique and range from 0 to 9.\n- The number is divisible by 7.\n\nLet's try different combinations of digits that satisfy the conditions:\n\n1. \\(a\\) cannot be 0, as it's a 5-digit number.\n2. Since each digit must be unique, consider possible values for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n\nTrying \\(a = 1\\):\n- The number format becomes \\(1bc1b\\).\n\nTrying different combinations:\n- \\(b = 2\\), \\(c = 3\\): Number \\(12321\\).\n- Check if 12321 is divisible by 7.\n\n\\[12321 \\div 7 = 1760.142857\\]\n\nThis is not a whole number, so \\(12321\\) is not divisible by 7.\n\nContinue with other combinations:\n\nTrying \\(a = 3\\):\n- The number format becomes \\(3bc3b\\).\n\nTrying different combinations:\n- \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 4\\): Number \\(31413\\).\n- Check if 31413 is divisible by 7. \n\n\\[31413 \\div 7 = 4487.571428\\]\n\nThis number is also not divisible by 7.\n\nTrying \\(a = 5\\):\n- The number format becomes \\(5bc5b\\).\n\nTrying different combinations:\n- \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 4\\): Number \\(51415\\).\n- Check if 51415 is divisible by 7.\n\n\\[51415 \\div 7 = 7345\\]\n\nThis is a whole number, so 51415 is divisible by 7.\n\nThus, the 5-digit number \\(51415\\) meets all the conditions:\n- It is divisible by 7.\n- The first and last digits are equal (5).\n- The second and fourth digits are equal (1).\n- Each digit appears only once.\n\nTherefore, the unique number is \\(51415\\)."
