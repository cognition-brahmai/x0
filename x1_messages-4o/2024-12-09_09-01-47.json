        "content": "To create two models named `UserBan` and `IPBan` in Django, you'll first need to define these models in your Django application's `models.py` file. Each model will have its own fields and options based on your requirements. Below is an example of how you might define these models:\n\n1. **UserBan Model**:\n   - Fields might include a reference to the `User` model, the reason for the ban, and the timestamp for when the ban was applied.\n\n2. **IPBan Model**:\n   - Fields might include the IP address, the reason for the ban, and the timestamp for when the ban was applied.\n\nHere's how you can define these models:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User\n\nclass UserBan(models.Model):\n    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='bans')\n    reason = models.TextField(null=True, blank=True)\n    banned_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"UserBan: {self.user.username} - {self.reason}\"\n\nclass IPBan(models.Model):\n    ip_address = models.GenericIPAddressField()\n    reason = models.TextField(null=True, blank=True)\n    banned_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"IPBan: {self.ip_address} - {self.reason}\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **UserBan Model**:\n  - `user`: A foreign key to the built-in `User` model, with `on_delete=models.CASCADE` to ensure that the ban is deleted if the user is deleted.\n  - `reason`: A text field to provide the reason for the ban.\n  - `banned_at`: A timestamp field that records when the ban was created, automatically set to the current date and time when a new record is created.\n\n- **IPBan Model**:\n  - `ip_address`: A field to store the IP address. `GenericIPAddressField` is used to allow both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.\n  - `reason`: Similar to the `UserBan` model, a text field for the reason.\n  - `banned_at`: Similar to the `UserBan` model, records when the ban was created.\n\n### Additional Steps:\n\n1. **Migrations**: After defining your models, don't forget to create and apply migrations. Run the following commands:\n   ```shell\n   python manage.py makemigrations\n   python manage.py migrate\n   ```\n\n2. **Admin Registration (optional)**: If you want to manage these models through the Django admin interface, you can register them in `admin.py`:\n   ```python\n   from django.contrib import admin\n   from .models import UserBan, IPBan\n\n   admin.site.register(UserBan)\n   admin.site.register(IPBan)\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to set up and manage `UserBan` and `IPBan` models in your Django application effectively."
