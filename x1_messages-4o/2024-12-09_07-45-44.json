I've written a code to attempt this but it's creating many files with empty content instead. How can I correctly split one CSV file into five separate CSV files? Here's the code I have been using:\n\n```python\nimport codecs\nimport csv\n\nNO_OF_LINES_PER_FILE = 1000\n\ndef again(count_file_header,count):\n    f3 = open('write_'+count_file_header+'.csv', 'at')\n    with open('import_1458922827.csv', 'rb') as csvfile:\n        candidate_info_reader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',', quoting=csv.QUOTE_ALL)\n        co = 0      \n        for row in candidate_info_reader:\n            co = co + 1\n            count  = count + 1\n            if count <= count:\n                pass\n            elif count >= NO_OF_LINES_PER_FILE:\n                count_file_header = count + NO_OF_LINES_PER_FILE\n                again(count_file_header,count)\n            else:\n                writer = csv.writer(f3,delimiter = ',', lineterminator='\\n',quoting=csv.QUOTE_ALL)\n                writer.writerow(row)\n\ndef read_write():\n    f3 = open('write_'+NO_OF_LINES_PER_FILE+'.csv', 'at')\n    with open('import_1458922827.csv', 'rb') as csvfile:\n        candidate_info_reader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',', quoting=csv.QUOTE_ALL)\n        count = 0       \n        for row in candidate_info_reader:\n            count  = count + 1\n            if count >= NO_OF_LINES_PER_FILE:\n                count_file_header = count + NO_OF_LINES_PER_FILE\n                again(count_file_header,count)\n            else:\n                writer = csv.writer(f3,delimiter = ',', lineterminator='\\n',quoting=csv.QUOTE_ALL)\n                writer.writerow(row)\n\nread_write()\n```"

        "content": "It looks like your current code has some issues, primarily because of how you handle file writing and recursion. The function `again()` is designed to recursively split the file, but it doesn't properly handle the range of rows for each split nor does it handle file closing correctly. Additionally, the loop logic seems to be faulty, which results in incorrect or empty file creation.\n\nHere's a more straightforward approach to splitting your CSV file into five parts:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\ndef split_csv(file_path, output_prefix, num_splits):\n    with open(file_path, 'r', newline='') as csvfile:\n        reader = list(csv.reader(csvfile))\n        total_rows = len(reader)\n        header, data = reader[0], reader[1:]\n        \n        rows_per_file = total_rows // num_splits\n        start = 0\n\n        for i in range(1, num_splits + 1):\n            end = start + rows_per_file\n            if i == num_splits:  # Ensure the last file gets any remaining rows\n                end = total_rows - 1\n\n            with open(f\"{output_prefix}_{i}.csv\", 'w', newline='') as outfile:\n                writer = csv.writer(outfile)\n                writer.writerow(header)\n                writer.writerows(data[start:end])\n            \n            start = end\n\n# Example usage\nsplit_csv('import_1458922827.csv', 'write', 5)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Reading and Writing**: The CSV file is read once into a list, and then split evenly across the specified number of files.\n2. **Headers**: The header is written to each new file.\n3. **File Naming**: Outputs are named based on the `output_prefix` and the file number.\n4. **Ensure Full Coverage**: The last file takes any remaining rows to ensure that all data is covered, even if the total number of rows isn't perfectly divisible by `num_splits`.\n\nThis script should correctly split your original CSV into five files, each containing an approximately equal number of rows, including the header. Adjust `num_splits` if you want a different number of output files."
