I have installed Anaconda and created two additional environments: 'py3k' (which has Python 3.3) and 'py34' (which has Python 3.4). However, when I launch 'ipython' from the terminal, it defaults to the 'root' environment created by the Anaconda installer, which holds Python 2.7. I want to switch the default environment to Python 3.4 without having to reinstall everything. Currently, I use the commands 'source activate py34' and 'ipython' in the shell to change the environment, but I find this process cumbersome as I use Python 3.4 most of the time."

        "content": "To change the default Anaconda environment so that it defaults to your 'py34' environment whenever you open a terminal, you can modify your shell's startup script to automatically activate the 'py34' environment. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### For Bash Shell\n\n1. **Open your `.bashrc` file:**\n\n   You can open the `.bashrc` file in your home directory using a text editor. For example, use the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   nano ~/.bashrc\n   ```\n\n2. **Add the activation command:**\n\n   Add the following line at the end of the `.bashrc` file:\n\n   ```bash\n   source activate py34\n   ```\n\n3. **Save and close the file:**\n\n   If you're using `nano`, you can save the changes by pressing `CTRL + O`, then `Enter`, and exit by pressing `CTRL + X`.\n\n4. **Reload the `.bashrc` file:**\n\n   To apply the changes, either close and reopen your terminal or run:\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bashrc\n   ```\n\n### For Zsh Shell\n\nIf you are using Zsh, you would instead modify the `.zshrc` file located in your home directory:\n\n1. **Open your `.zshrc` file:**\n\n   ```bash\n   nano ~/.zshrc\n   ```\n\n2. **Add the activation command:**\n\n   Add the following line at the end of the `.zshrc` file:\n\n   ```bash\n   source activate py34\n   ```\n\n3. **Save and close the file** (same process as in Bash).\n\n4. **Reload the `.zshrc` file:**\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.zshrc\n   ```\n\n### For Fish Shell\n\nIf you are using Fish shell, you should add the activation command to your `config.fish` file:\n\n1. **Open your `config.fish` file:**\n\n   ```bash\n   nano ~/.config/fish/config.fish\n   ```\n\n2. **Add the activation command:**\n\n   Add the following line at the end of the `config.fish` file:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda activate py34\n   ```\n\n3. **Save and close the file** (same process as in Bash).\n\n4. **Reload the `config.fish` file:**\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.config/fish/config.fish\n   ```\n\nAfter doing this, whenever you open a new terminal session, it will automatically activate the 'py34' environment, and you can start using Python 3.4 directly by just typing `ipython`. This setup will save you from having to manually activate the environment every time."
