This happened after I pulled another version of my app from git. This error doesn't occur with the same code on a different machine. I've tried using \"--fake\" with \"zero\" and \"squashmigrations\" to previous, but neither has resolved the issue. How can I solve this?"

        "content": "When dealing with Django migration issues like a `KeyError`, especially after pulling code from a version control system like Git, it often implies that there might be a mismatch or inconsistency between your current database schema and the migrations in your codebase. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Migration Files:**\n   - Ensure that all migration files are present in your local repository. Compare the migrations folder with the one on your other machine where it works. Make sure no migration files are missing or corrupted.\n\n2. **Database State:**\n   - The error might be due to discrepancies between the database state and the migrations. Check the `django_migrations` table in your database to see which migrations have been applied.\n\n3. **Clear Migration Files:**\n   - As a last resort, you can try deleting your migration files (except `__init__.py`) and running `makemigrations` again. Be aware that this can be risky if you have existing data, so backup your database first.\n\n4. **Reset Migrations:**\n   - Assuming you can afford to reset your database, you can try:\n     ```bash\n     python manage.py migrate app_name zero\n     ```\n   - Then delete the migration files and re-run:\n     ```bash\n     python manage.py makemigrations\n     python manage.py migrate\n     ```\n\n5. **Inspect Changes in Model:**\n   - Look for changes in your models that might not be captured by migrations. Sometimes manual changes in the database schema or direct changes in models without running `makemigrations` can cause issues.\n\n6. **Check for Circular Dependencies:**\n   - Circular dependencies in your models can sometimes cause issues. Ensure that your models and migrations do not have circular import issues.\n\n7. **Environment Differences:**\n   - Double-check that both environments are the same in terms of Django version, Python version, and any other dependencies. Use a tool like `pip freeze` to compare installed packages.\n\n8. **Log and Debug:**\n   - Use logging or print statements in your migration files to identify where the error might be coming from. This can help narrow down the problematic migration or model.\n\n9. **Use `--database` Option:**\n   - If you are using multiple databases, ensure you are applying migrations to the correct database using the `--database` option.\n\n10. **Consult Git History:**\n    - Review the recent changes in the git history related to model changes or migration files. This might give you clues about what caused the issue.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and fix the issue with your migrations. Remember to always backup your data before making significant changes to your database or migrations."
