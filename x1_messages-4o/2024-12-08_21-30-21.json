The sequence starts with 0 and 1. Here are the first few numbers in the sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. What is the next number in the sequence? You can't use the table to solve this, but you can use your brainpower!"

Given the sequence you provided: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, we can calculate the next number by adding the last two numbers in the sequence:\n\n5 + 8 = 13\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is 13."
