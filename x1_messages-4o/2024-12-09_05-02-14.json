        "content": "When you're trying to call another class-based view (CBV) from within a CBV, especially to access its context, you might run into some issues, mainly because the context isn't returned directly from the `as_view()` method call, which is what you're trying to do with `ShowAppsView.as_view()(request, username)`.\n\nHere are a few things to consider and potentially adjust in your approach:\n\n1. **Calling Class-Based Views Internally**:\n   - The `as_view()` method is a class method used to convert the class-based view into a function-based view, which Django uses for routing.\n   - When you call `ShowAppsView.as_view()(request, username)`, it processes the request but doesn't return the context in a straightforward way for you to use.\n\n2. **Refactor for Context Sharing**:\n   - A better approach is to refactor the logic of `ShowAppsView` into a method that can be reused. This method would perform the context processing and return the context dictionary.\n\nHere's an example of how you can refactor your code:\n\n```python\nclass ShowAppsView(LoginRequiredMixin, CurrentUserIdMixin, TemplateView):\n    template_name = \"accounts/thing.html\"\n\n    @method_decorator(csrf_exempt)\n    def dispatch(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        return super(ShowAppsView, self).dispatch(*args, **kwargs)\n\n    def get_context_data(self, request, username, **kwargs):\n        context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs)\n        u = get_object_or_404(User, pk=self.current_user_id(request))\n\n        if u.username == username:\n            cities_list = City.objects.filter(user_id__exact=self.current_user_id(request)).order_by('-kms')\n            allcategories = Category.objects.all()\n            allcities = City.objects.all()\n            rating_list = Rating.objects.filter(user=u)\n            totalMiles = sum(city.kms for city in cities_list)\n\n            context.update({\n                'totalMiles': totalMiles,\n                'cities_list': cities_list,\n                'rating_list': rating_list,\n                'allcities': allcities,\n                'allcategories': allcategories\n            })\n\n        return context\n\n    def get(self, request, username, **kwargs):\n        context = self.get_context_data(request, username, **kwargs)\n        return self.render_to_response(context)\n\nclass ManageAppView(LoginRequiredMixin, CheckTokenMixin, CurrentUserIdMixin, TemplateView):\n    template_name = \"accounts/thing.html\"\n\n    def compute_context(self, request, username):\n        # some logic here                        \n        if u.username == username:\n            if request.GET.get('action') == 'delete':\n                # some logic here\n                show_apps_view = ShowAppsView()\n                context = show_apps_view.get_context_data(request, username)\n                # Use this context as needed within `ManageAppView`\n                return context\n```\n\n3. **Using the Refactored Method**:\n   - Now within `ManageAppView`, you can call `ShowAppsView().get_context_data(request, username)` to get the context needed from `ShowAppsView`.\n\nBy refactoring the context setup into a separate method (`get_context_data`), you can reuse it across different views or even within the same view without duplicating code. This approach also adheres to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle."
