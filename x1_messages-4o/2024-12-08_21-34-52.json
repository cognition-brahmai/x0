        "content": "To recursively calculate the sum of numbers in an array while ensuring that the sum does not exceed a certain limit, you can implement a recursive function in Scala. Here's how you can do it for the array `[2, 5, 8, 15, 7]`, ensuring that the sum is less than 20:\n\n```scala\nobject RecursiveSum {\n  def sumWithLimit(arr: Array[Int], limit: Int, index: Int = 0, currentSum: Int = 0): Int = {\n    // Base case: if the index is out of bounds or the current sum has reached the limit\n    if (index >= arr.length || currentSum >= limit) {\n      return currentSum\n    }\n\n    // Calculate new sum including the current element\n    val newSum = currentSum + arr(index)\n\n    // Decide whether to include the current element based on the limit\n    if (newSum < limit) {\n      sumWithLimit(arr, limit, index + 1, newSum)\n    } else {\n      currentSum\n    }\n  }\n\n  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\n    val numbers = Array(2, 5, 8, 15, 7)\n    val limit = 20\n    val result = sumWithLimit(numbers, limit)\n    println(s\"The sum of numbers with the limit $limit is: $result\")\n  }\n}\n\nRecursiveSum.main(Array())\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Function `sumWithLimit`:** This function takes an array, a limit, an index, and the current sum as parameters.\n- **Base Case:** The recursion stops if the index goes beyond the array length or if the current sum has reached or exceeded the limit.\n- **Recursive Case:** It calculates the new sum by adding the current element. If the new sum is still less than the limit, it proceeds to the next element by calling the function recursively with the updated index and sum.\n- **Main Function:** It initializes the array and the limit, then calls the recursive function to compute the sum.\n\nThis approach ensures that you only include numbers in the sum as long as the total doesn't exceed the specified limit."
