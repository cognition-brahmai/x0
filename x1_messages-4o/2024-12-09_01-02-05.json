        "content": "When you use an L2 normalizer from scikit-learn, you are normalizing the data by scaling it so that the L2 norm of each sample is 1. This means that the prediction you get from your model is also in this normalized form, and you need to reverse this process to get the original scale of your predicted values.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to convert your normalized predictions back to their original scale:\n\n1. **Understand the L2 Normalization:**\n   - For each sample \\( x \\), L2 normalization scales \\( x \\) such that the sum of the squares of its components is 1: \n     \\[\n     \\text{normalized\\_x} = \\frac{x}{\\|x\\|_2}\n     \\]\n   - \\(\\|x\\|_2\\) is the L2 norm of \\( x \\), calculated as \\(\\sqrt{\\sum x_i^2}\\).\n\n2. **Store the L2 Norms:**\n   - When you normalize your data, store the L2 norm of each sample. This is crucial because you need these norms to reverse the normalization.\n\n3. **Reverse the Normalization:**\n   - For each predicted value, multiply it by the stored L2 norm of the corresponding sample.\n   - If your `y_predict` corresponds to multiple features, ensure you are reversing the normalization correctly by applying the stored norm to the respective features.\n\nHere's a simple example in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import normalize\n\n# Sample data\nX = np.array([[3, 4], [1, 2], [5, 12]])\ny = np.array([100, 50, 200])\n\n# Normalize the data\nX_normalized = normalize(X, norm='l2')\ny_normalized = normalize(y.reshape(1, -1), norm='l2').ravel()\n\n# Fit your model, predict, etc.\n# For demonstration, let's say y_predict is obtained similarly\ny_predict_normalized = y_normalized  # This would be the model's output\n\n# Reverse the normalization\nl2_norms_y = np.linalg.norm(y.reshape(1, -1), axis=1)\ny_predict_original = y_predict_normalized * l2_norms_y\n\nprint(\"Original Predicted Values:\", y_predict_original)\n```\n\nMake sure you have stored the original L2 norms of your target variable `y` before normalization. Apply these norms to your `y_predict` after the model prediction to convert them back to the original scale."
