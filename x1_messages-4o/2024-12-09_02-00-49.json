The file output looks something like this:\n\n```python\nUnnamed  Data\n    0   0.99319613\n    1   0.99319613\n    2   0.99319613\n    3   0.99319613\n    4   0.99319613\n    5   0.99319613\n```\n\nIs there a way to either not include this index column during the conversion or remove it afterwards?"

        "content": "Yes, you can easily prevent the index column from being included in your CSV output by setting the `index` parameter to `False` in the `to_csv` method. Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read the Excel file\ndata_xls = pd.read_excel('excelfile.xlsx', 'Sheet2', index_col=None)\n\n# Write to CSV without the index\ndata_xls.to_csv('csvfile.csv', encoding='utf-8', index=False)\n```\n\nBy setting `index=False`, the index column will not be written to the CSV file, and you'll get the desired output without the unwanted index column."
