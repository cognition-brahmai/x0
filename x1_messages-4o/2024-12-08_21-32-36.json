But here's the catch - you need to select books that have been game-changers in terms of not just their revolutionary applications, but also their innovative methodologies and groundbreaking theories. And you must demonstrate the evolution of AI across different time periods. To make it even more interesting, can you also provide a logical explanation for how each book has contributed to the advancement of AI?"
