        "content": "Carbohydrates are organic molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, typically with the general formula \\( C_n(H_2O)_n \\). They are one of the primary macronutrients and serve as a major energy source for living organisms. The structure of carbohydrates can vary significantly, but they are generally classified into three main types: monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides.\n\n1. **Monosaccharides**: These are the simplest form of carbohydrates and are often referred to as simple sugars. They consist of a single sugar unit with a backbone of three to seven carbon atoms. Common examples include glucose, fructose, and galactose. Monosaccharides can exist in linear or ring forms, and they often form rings in aqueous solutions.\n\n2. **Disaccharides**: These carbohydrates are composed of two monosaccharide units linked together by a glycosidic bond. Disaccharides are formed through a dehydration reaction, where a water molecule is removed. Common examples include sucrose (table sugar), lactose (milk sugar), and maltose (malt sugar).\n\n3. **Polysaccharides**: These are complex carbohydrates composed of long chains of monosaccharide units linked together. They can be branched or unbranched and serve various functions such as energy storage or providing structural support. Examples include starch and glycogen (both used for energy storage in plants and animals, respectively) and cellulose (which provides structural support in plant cell walls).\n\nThe structure of carbohydrates allows them to be versatile in function, serving as energy sources, structural components, and as part of cellular recognition processes. Their properties are largely determined by the types of monosaccharide units present, the length of the carbohydrate chain, and the type of glycosidic bonds connecting the units."
