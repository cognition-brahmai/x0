Is it correct to assume that the requests module is stateless? If I were to repeatedly call 'get' for the same URL, would it create a new connection each time?"

        "content": "The `requests` module in Python is not stateless when it comes to managing connections. By default, it uses persistent connections, which means it reuses already-established TCP connections when making multiple requests to the same host. This behavior is achieved through the use of a connection pool, which is managed by `urllib3`, a library that `requests` relies on for handling HTTP connections.\n\nWhen you call `requests.get()` repeatedly for the same URL, the module will attempt to reuse an existing connection from the pool if one is available. This is a feature known as connection pooling, which helps improve performance by reducing the overhead of opening and closing connections for each request.\n\nIf you want to further control the reuse of connections, you can use a `requests.Session` object. A `Session` object allows you to persist certain parameters across requests, and it maintains a pool of connections. Here's an example of how you can use it:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Create a session object\nsession = requests.Session()\n\n# Use the session to make requests\nresponse1 = session.get('https://example.com')\nresponse2 = session.get('https://example.com')\n\n# Both requests will attempt to reuse the same connection\n```\n\nBy using a `Session`, you can ensure that connections are reused more efficiently, especially when making multiple requests to the same host. Additionally, a `Session` can also help you manage cookies, headers, and other parameters that you may want to persist across requests."
