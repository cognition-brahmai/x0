For clarity, Papua New Guinea, which lies to the east of Papua province, is a country with a diverse range of languages but does not fit the specific criteria mentioned. If you're looking for an island nation on the equator with unique characteristics, Kiribati or Nauru might come to mind, but they don't fit all the given hints either. Unfortunately, no island nation perfectly matches all the criteria provided."
