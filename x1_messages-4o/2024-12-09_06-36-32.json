It works fine when using `remote_api_shell.py`, but fails when I try to access it from within a Python script. I followed the sample code provided by Google for accessing the Remote API from a local client. However, when the call to `remote_api_stub.ConfigureRemoteApi()` is made, I get an error saying `'module' object has no attribute 'FancyProxyHandler'`. How can I resolve this?\n\nHere is the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nfrom google.appengine.ext.remote_api import remote_api_stub\nimport getpass\n\ndef auth_func():\n  return (raw_input('Username:'), getpass.getpass('Password:'))\n\nremote_api_stub.ConfigureRemoteApi(None, '/_ah/remote_api', auth_func,\n                               'localhost:8080')\n```\n\nI'm also importing the `fix_sys_path()` from `dev_appserver.py` to set my `sys.path` correctly for the Google App Engine SDK:\n\n```python\nimport dev_appserver\ndev_appserver.fix_sys_path()\n```\n\nWhich adds, among other paths, the following line to my `sys.path`:\n\n```python\n'/google_appengine_1.8.0/lib/fancy_urllib'\n```\n\nBut I'm still getting the following error:\n\n```python\nopener.add_handler(fancy_urllib.FancyProxyHandler())\nAttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'FancyProxyHandler'\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that the `fancy_urllib` module is missing the `FancyProxyHandler` attribute, which is causing the `remote_api_stub.ConfigureRemoteApi()` call to fail. This is likely due to a mismatch or incompatibility between the SDK version and the libraries being used.\n\nHere's how you can address this issue:\n\n1. **Verify SDK Installation**: Ensure that your Google App Engine SDK is correctly installed and that all necessary components are available. Sometimes, components may not be installed properly, leading to missing modules.\n\n2. **Update the SDK**: Since you're using version 1.8.0, it's possible that this version has bugs or is outdated. Consider updating to a later version of the Google App Engine SDK. Newer versions may have resolved this issue.\n\n3. **Check `fancy_urllib` Module**: Verify that the `fancy_urllib` module is correctly included in your `sys.path` and is compatible with the version of the App Engine SDK you are using. You may want to explore the contents of the `fancy_urllib` directory to check for the presence of `FancyProxyHandler`.\n\n4. **Direct Import**: If `FancyProxyHandler` exists in the `fancy_urllib` module but is not being recognized, try importing it directly in your script to ensure it's accessible:\n\n   ```python\n   from google.appengine.ext.remote_api import remote_api_stub\n   from fancy_urllib import FancyProxyHandler\n   import getpass\n\n   def auth_func():\n     return (raw_input('Username:'), getpass.getpass('Password:'))\n\n   remote_api_stub.ConfigureRemoteApi(None, '/_ah/remote_api', auth_func,\n                                  'localhost:8080')\n   ```\n\n5. **Alternative Libraries**: If the issue persists, consider using alternative libraries or methods to achieve your goal. Check the Google Cloud documentation for any updates or changes to the recommended way of accessing the Remote API.\n\n6. **Consult Documentation and Forums**: Google App Engine's documentation and community forums can be a valuable resource. There may be known issues or patches available for the version you are using.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error and successfully access the Remote API from your Python script."
