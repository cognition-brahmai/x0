I want to distinguish between different causes for an ImportError (e.g. because the module named 'foo' is not installed at all), and detect the case in which the 'setup.py' is located in the current directory. I started with the following code block:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    from _foo import *\nexcept ImportError:\n    ## check whether in the source directory...\n```\n\nWhat would be an elegant way of doing this?"

        "content": "To catch an `ImportError` and provide more informative error messages, you can use a combination of exception handling and checking for specific conditions. Here's a way to handle the import and provide detailed error messages:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\n\ndef is_in_source_directory():\n    # Check if 'setup.py' exists in the current directory\n    return os.path.isfile('setup.py')\n\ntry:\n    from _foo import *\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    if is_in_source_directory():\n        print(\"ImportError: It seems you are in the source directory and '_foo' cannot be imported.\")\n        print(\"Please ensure the module is built before importing.\")\n    else:\n        # Further investigation to check if the module is installed at all\n        try:\n            __import__('_foo')\n        except ModuleNotFoundError:\n            print(\"ImportError: The module '_foo' is not installed. Please install the module.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"ImportError: The module '_foo' exists but could not be imported due to another reason.\")\n            print(f\"Details: {e}\")\n    sys.exit(1)  # Exit the program if the import fails\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Function `is_in_source_directory`:** This function checks if `setup.py` is present in the current directory, which is a common indicator that the directory is the source directory.\n\n2. **Try-Except Block:**\n   - **First `try` block:** Attempts to import the module `_foo`.\n   - **If `ImportError` occurs:**\n     - **Check Source Directory:** If in the source directory, it suggests that the module might not be built yet.\n     - **Check Module Installation:** Uses `__import__` to check if the module is installed at all. If `ModuleNotFoundError` is raised, it indicates the module is not installed.\n     - **General ImportError:** If the module exists but couldn't be imported, provide the exception details to help diagnose other issues (e.g., cyclic imports, missing dependencies).\n\n3. **Exit the program:** If the import fails, it exits the program with a non-zero status to indicate an error.\n\nThis approach provides detailed feedback on why the import might have failed and suggests possible actions to resolve the issue."
