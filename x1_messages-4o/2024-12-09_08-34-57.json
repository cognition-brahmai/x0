Below is the code I'm using:\n\n```python\ndef deco(func):\n\n    @functools.wraps(func)\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        return func(*args, **kwargs)\n\n    return wrapper\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef x():\n    return 0\n\n@deco\ndef test_something(x):\n    assert x == 0\n```\n\nWhen I run this, I get a TypeError: `test_something() takes exactly 1 argument (0 given)`. Is there a way to fix this, preferably without modifying the decorator too much since the decorator is used outside the testing code too?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The issue you're encountering stems from the fact that the decorator `deco` is interfering with `pytest`'s ability to inject fixtures into the test function. When you decorate a function with `@deco`, the function signature is altered, and `pytest` no longer recognizes it as a test function expecting fixtures.\n\nTo resolve this issue without significantly altering your decorator, you can use `functools.wraps` in combination with `inspect.signature` to modify the wrapper function to correctly handle the arguments expected by the original function. Here's how you can modify your decorator:\n\n```python\nimport functools\nimport inspect\n\ndef deco(func):\n    signature = inspect.signature(func)\n\n    @functools.wraps(func)\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        bound_args = signature.bind_partial(*args, **kwargs)\n        return func(*bound_args.args, **bound_args.kwargs)\n\n    return wrapper\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef x():\n    return 0\n\n@deco\ndef test_something(x):\n    assert x == 0\n```\n\nIn this modified version of the `deco` decorator, we're using `inspect.signature` to capture the signature of the original function. The `signature.bind_partial` method is then used within the wrapper to ensure that arguments are bound correctly, allowing `pytest` to inject the fixture.\n\nThis approach should allow you to keep your decorator largely unchanged while still enabling `pytest` to inject fixtures as expected."
