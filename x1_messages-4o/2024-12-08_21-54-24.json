        "content": "Certainly! Your SQL query is well-structured to retrieve the desired information about TED Talks related to Artificial Intelligence. Here's a refined version of your query with some additional considerations:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    speaker.full_name, \n    talk.title, \n    talk.description, \n    talk.url, \n    DATE_FORMAT(talk.date_time, '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%i:%sZ') AS date_time_iso8601, \n    talk.duration, \n    talk.views \nFROM \n    talks AS talk \n    INNER JOIN speakers AS speaker \n        ON talk.speaker_id = speaker.id \nWHERE \n    talk.topic = 'Artificial Intelligence' \nORDER BY \n    talk.date_time DESC;\n```\n\n### Key Considerations:\n\n1. **Date Format**: The `DATE_FORMAT` function is used to ensure that the date and time are in the ISO 8601 format. Please adjust this if your SQL dialect does not support such a function or if you need a different format.\n\n2. **Ordering**: The results are ordered by `talk.date_time` in descending order to get the most recent talks first.\n\n3. **Assumptions**: \n   - The `speakers` table contains a `full_name` field.\n   - The `talks` table includes fields for `title`, `description`, `url`, `date_time`, `duration`, `views`, `speaker_id`, and `topic`.\n   - The `topic` field in the `talks` table is used to filter talks related to Artificial Intelligence.\n\nEnsure that your database schema aligns with these assumptions. Adjust table names and field names as needed to fit your specific database structure."
