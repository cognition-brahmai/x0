My code `print(urllib.quote(\"ch\u00e2teu\", safe=''))` is throwing an AttributeError saying \"`module` object has no attribute 'quote'\". Even trying to import urllib or urllib.quote leads to the same error. However, I can access `urllib.request` using `import urllib.request`. How can I correctly import and use `urllib.quote()`?"

        "content": "In Python 3, the `urllib` module was reorganized, and some functions were moved to different submodules. The `quote` function, which you are trying to use, is now located in the `urllib.parse` submodule.\n\nTo fix your issue, you should import `quote` from `urllib.parse` instead. Here is how you can modify your code to work correctly in Python 3:\n\n```python\nimport urllib.parse\n\n# Use urllib.parse.quote to URL encode the string\nencoded_string = urllib.parse.quote(\"ch\u00e2teu\", safe='')\nprint(encoded_string)\n```\n\nThis will correctly URL encode the string \"ch\u00e2teu\". The `urllib.parse.quote` function is used to percent-encode a string, which is useful when preparing strings to be included in URLs."
