I'm not aware of any mechanism provided by pytest to resolve conftest files in multiple locations within the same folder, so I've created a workaround as shown below. Is there a better way to achieve this?\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport os\n\nsys.path.append(os.path.dirname(__file__))\n\nfrom _conftest_private_part_1 import *\nfrom _conftest_private_part_2 import *\nfrom _conftest_private_part_3 import *\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef a_fixture_that_is_part_of_the_public_conftest_api():\n    pass\n```"

        "content": "Splitting your `conftest.py` into multiple parts for better organization and maintainability is a common need, especially when dealing with large test suites. While your current workaround using separate modules and importing them into `conftest.py` works, there are a few other approaches you might consider to achieve a cleaner and more maintainable solution:\n\n1. **Modular Organization with Packages**:\n   - You can organize your test utilities and fixtures into a package structure. Create a directory (e.g., `test_utils`) and place your fixture modules there. Make sure to include an `__init__.py` file to treat the directory as a package.\n\n   ```plaintext\n   /tests\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 conftest.py\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 test_utils/\n   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 fixture_module1.py\n   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 fixture_module2.py\n   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 fixture_module3.py\n   ```\n\n   In `conftest.py`, import only the fixtures you want to expose publicly:\n\n   ```python\n   from test_utils.fixture_module1 import public_fixture1\n   from test_utils.fixture_module2 import public_fixture2\n\n   # Use private fixtures within the package module as needed\n   ```\n\n2. **Prefix/Underscore Private Fixtures**:\n   - Another approach is to prefix private fixtures with an underscore to indicate that they are intended for internal use only. This doesn't prevent their use, but it communicates intent clearly.\n\n   ```python\n   # In fixture_module1.py\n   @pytest.fixture\n   def _private_fixture():\n       pass\n\n   @pytest.fixture\n   def public_fixture():\n       pass\n   ```\n\n3. **Customizing Fixture Visibility**:\n   - Although pytest does not have a built-in mechanism to hide fixtures, you can document which fixtures are intended for external use. Use comments or a README file to specify which fixtures are part of the public API.\n\n4. **Use pytest Plugin Mechanism**:\n   - If your fixtures are complex and reusable across projects, consider creating a pytest plugin. This allows you to package fixtures and helpers in a separate module, which can be included in other projects.\n\nBy adopting one of these approaches, you can maintain a clean and organized test structure while controlling the exposure of fixtures. This will make your test suite more maintainable and easier for other developers to understand and use."
