After training and validating the model on a GPU, I saved the model and tokenizer using the following commands: `best_model.save_pretrained('./saved_model/')` and `tokenizer.save_pretrained('./saved_model/')`. This generated a number of files in the `saved_model` directory including `config.json`, `added_token.json`, `special_tokens_map.json`, `tokenizer_config.json`, `vocab.txt`, and `pytorch_model.bin`. I can load the model using the command `model = torch.load('./saved_model/pytorch_model.bin',map_location=torch.device('cpu'))`, but I am unsure of how to load the tokenizer. I am new to Pytorch, and I am not sure if I am saving the model correctly. Can someone explain how I can load the tokenizer?"

        "content": "You're on the right track with saving your model and tokenizer using the `save_pretrained()` method. In the Hugging Face Transformers library, loading the tokenizer is straightforward and doesn't use the `torch.load()` method. Instead, you should use the `from_pretrained()` method provided by the library, which is specifically designed for this purpose. Here's how you can load your tokenizer:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import BertTokenizer\n\n# Load the tokenizer\ntokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('./saved_model/')\n```\n\nThis command will load the tokenizer using the configuration and vocabulary files you saved in the `./saved_model/` directory.\n\nAs for loading the model, since you're working with a BERT model, you should also use the `from_pretrained()` method from the Transformers library. Here's how you can load the model:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import BertForSequenceClassification  # or another appropriate BERT model class\n\n# Load the model\nmodel = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('./saved_model/', map_location=torch.device('cpu'))\n```\n\nThis will correctly load the model architecture and weights, as well as the configuration settings from the `config.json` file.\n\nBy using the `from_pretrained()` method for both the model and tokenizer, you ensure that all necessary configurations are loaded correctly, and this is the recommended approach when working with Hugging Face Transformers."
