        "content": "The error you're encountering is a common one when dealing with text encodings in Python. The `UnicodeDecodeError` suggests that the file you're trying to read is not actually encoded in UTF-8, or it contains some bytes that are not valid UTF-8 sequences.\n\nHere's how you can solve it:\n\n1. **Check the File Encoding:** \n   - Open the file in a text editor that supports encoding detection, like Notepad++ or Sublime Text, and check the encoding. Common encodings include `utf-8`, `latin1`, `iso-8859-1`, and `cp1252`.\n\n2. **Use the Correct Encoding:**\n   - Once you've determined the correct encoding, you can specify it in the `read_csv` function. For example, if the encoding is `latin1`, use the following code:\n     ```python\n     Past = pd.read_csv(\"C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/Python/Past.csv\", encoding='latin1')\n     ```\n\n3. **Try a Different Encoding:** \n   - If you're unsure about the encoding, you can try using `latin1` or `iso-8859-1` as a more permissive encoding, which can handle a broader range of characters:\n     ```python\n     Past = pd.read_csv(\"C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/Python/Past.csv\", encoding='latin1')\n     ```\n\n4. **Use Error Handling:**\n   - If you still encounter issues, you can handle encoding errors by using the `errors` parameter:\n     ```python\n     Past = pd.read_csv(\"C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/Python/Past.csv\", encoding='utf-8', errors='replace')\n     ```\n   - This will replace problematic characters with a replacement character, allowing you to read the file without an error.\n\nBy trying these steps, you should be able to read the CSV file without encountering the `UnicodeDecodeError`."
