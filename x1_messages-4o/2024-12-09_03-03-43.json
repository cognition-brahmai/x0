        "content": "The `urllib2` library in Python 2 does not directly support the HTTP PUT and DELETE methods in the same way it does for GET and POST. However, you can still perform PUT and DELETE requests using `urllib2` by creating a custom request and specifying the method.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. **PUT Request Example:**\n\n```python\nimport urllib2\n\nurl = 'http://example.com/api/resource'\ndata = '{\"key\": \"value\"}'  # Your JSON data here\nheaders = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}\n\nrequest = urllib2.Request(url, data=data.encode('utf-8'), headers=headers)\nrequest.get_method = lambda: 'PUT'  # Override the method to PUT\n\ntry:\n    response = urllib2.urlopen(request)\n    print(response.read())\nexcept urllib2.HTTPError as e:\n    print(e.code)\n    print(e.read())\n```\n\n2. **DELETE Request Example:**\n\n```python\nimport urllib2\n\nurl = 'http://example.com/api/resource'\nheaders = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}\n\nrequest = urllib2.Request(url, headers=headers)\nrequest.get_method = lambda: 'DELETE'  # Override the method to DELETE\n\ntry:\n    response = urllib2.urlopen(request)\n    print(response.read())\nexcept urllib2.HTTPError as e:\n    print(e.code)\n    print(e.read())\n```\n\nIn these examples:\n\n- Replace `http://example.com/api/resource` with the actual URL of the resource you are interacting with on the Piston API.\n- For PUT requests, provide the data to be sent in the request body.\n- Set the `Content-Type` header to the appropriate value (e.g., `application/json`) depending on your data format.\n- Override the `get_method` function of the `Request` object to specify the HTTP method you want to use.\n\nNote that `urllib2` is a Python 2 module and has been replaced by `urllib` in Python 3. If you are working in a Python 3 environment, you should use the `requests` library, which provides a much more convenient API for handling HTTP requests."
