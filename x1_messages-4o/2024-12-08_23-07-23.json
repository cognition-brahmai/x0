The slope (\\( m_1 \\)) of this line is 4.\n\n2. **Determine the Slope of the Perpendicular Line:**\n   If two lines are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1. Therefore, if the slope of the line we need to find is \\( m_2 \\), then:\n   \\[\n   m_1 \\times m_2 = -1 \\Rightarrow 4 \\times m_2 = -1 \\Rightarrow m_2 = -\\frac{1}{4}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Write the Equation of the Perpendicular Line:**\n   We use the point-slope form of a line equation for this, which is:\n   \\[\n   y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\n   \\]\n   Given the point (-1, 3) and the slope \\( m_2 = -\\frac{1}{4} \\), the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   y - 3 = -\\frac{1}{4}(x + 1)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Equation:**\n   \\[\n   y - 3 = -\\frac{1}{4}x - \\frac{1}{4}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = -\\frac{1}{4}x - \\frac{1}{4} + 3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = -\\frac{1}{4}x + \\frac{12}{4} - \\frac{1}{4}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = -\\frac{1}{4}x + \\frac{11}{4}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the equation of the line that passes through the point (-1, 3) and is perpendicular to the line \\( y = 4x + 9 \\) is \\( y = -\\frac{1}{4}x + \\frac{11}{4} \\)."
