The syntax is slightly different from the one you're used to in other languages like C, C++, or JavaScript. In Python, you can achieve the same functionality with the following syntax:\n\n```python\nfoo = \"True\" if test else \"False\"\n```\n\nThis will assign the value `\"True\"` to `foo` if `test` evaluates to `True`, and `\"False\"` otherwise.\n\nSince you're using Python 2.7, this syntax is fully compatible and will work without any issues. Python 2.7 supports conditional expressions just like Python 3.x."
