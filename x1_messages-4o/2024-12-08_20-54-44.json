        "content": "The formula you've provided is a simplified way to estimate the energy expenditure (EE) during running:\n\n\\[ EE = 1.036 \\times BW \\times D \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- **EE (Energy Expenditure)**: This is the total energy used during the activity, measured in kilocalories (kcal). This formula expresses it in terms of energy expended per kilogram of body weight per meter traveled.\n\n- **1.036**: This is a constant that represents the average caloric cost of running per kilogram of body weight per meter. It is derived from empirical data and may vary slightly based on individual efficiency, running speed, and terrain.\n\n- **BW (Body Weight)**: This is the mass of the person running, measured in kilograms (kg). Body weight is a crucial factor because a heavier person generally expends more energy to move the same distance compared to a lighter person.\n\n- **D (Distance Traveled)**: This is the total distance covered during the run, measured in meters (m). The farther one runs, the more energy is expended.\n\nThis formula provides a straightforward way to estimate the energy expenditure during running based on body weight and distance. It's important to note that individual variations such as running efficiency, pace, and terrain can affect the actual energy expenditure, so this formula serves as an approximation."
