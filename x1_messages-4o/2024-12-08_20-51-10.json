The value of \\( e \\) is approximately 2.71828.\n\n2. **log10(100)** is the base 10 logarithm of 100. Since 100 is \\( 10^2 \\), this is equal to 2.\n\n3. **ln(2)** is the natural logarithm of 2, approximately 0.693147.\n\n4. **sqrt(49)** is the square root of 49, which is 7.\n\nNow, substitute these values into the expression:\n\n\\[ \\exp(1) + \\frac{\\log_{10}(100)}{\\ln(2)} - \\sqrt{49} \\]\n\n\\[ \\approx 2.71828 + \\frac{2}{0.693147} - 7 \\]\n\nCalculate the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{0.693147} \\approx 2.88539 \\]\n\nNow, substitute back into the expression:\n\n\\[ 2.71828 + 2.88539 - 7 \\]\n\nFinally, perform the arithmetic:\n\n\\[ 5.60367 - 7 = -1.39633 \\]\n\nSo, the result of the expression is approximately \\( -1.39633 \\)."
