        "content": "Certainly! In Python, you can add a method to an individual instance of a class without modifying the class itself. This technique is known as \"monkey patching.\" Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can accomplish this:\n\n1. **Define the Method**: First, create a function that you want to add as a method to an object instance.\n\n2. **Bind the Method to the Instance**: Use the `types` module's `MethodType` to bind the function to the instance as a method.\n\nHere's an example to illustrate this:\n\n```python\nfrom types import MethodType\n\n# Define a sample class\nclass MyClass:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n\n# Define a function that we want to add as a method\ndef greet(self):\n    print(f\"Hello, {self.name}!\")\n\n# Create an instance of MyClass\nmy_object = MyClass(\"Alice\")\n\n# Bind the function to the instance as a method\nmy_object.greet = MethodType(greet, my_object)\n\n# Now you can call the new method on the instance\nmy_object.greet()  # Output: Hello, Alice!\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **`MethodType`**: This is used to bind a function to an instance so that it behaves like a method. The first argument is the function to bind, and the second argument is the instance you want to bind it to.\n  \n- **Instance-Specific**: This method will only be available to the instance `my_object` and not to any other instances of `MyClass` unless you bind it to them as well.\n\n- **Use Cases**: While this can be useful in certain scenarios (like mocking or testing), it's generally not recommended for regular use because it can make your code harder to understand and maintain.\n\nFeel free to ask if you have any questions or need further clarification!"
