How can I use Django's logger to log the entire traceback when a KeyError exception is raised?"

        "content": "To log exceptions, including the traceback, using Django's logging framework, you need to configure the logger in your Django settings and use it in your code. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n1. **Configure Logging in Django settings:**\n\n   First, you need to set up logging in your `settings.py` file. Here's an example configuration that logs errors to a file:\n\n   ```python\n   LOGGING = {\n       'version': 1,\n       'disable_existing_loggers': False,\n       'handlers': {\n           'file': {\n               'level': 'ERROR',\n               'class': 'logging.FileHandler',\n               'filename': 'django_error.log',\n           },\n       },\n       'loggers': {\n           'django': {\n               'handlers': ['file'],\n               'level': 'ERROR',\n               'propagate': True,\n           },\n       },\n   }\n   ```\n\n   This configuration sets up a handler that writes log messages to a file named `django_error.log`. You can adjust the `level` and `filename` to suit your needs.\n\n2. **Use the Logger in Your Code:**\n\n   Import the logging module and get the logger inside your Django application or module. Then, use it to log exceptions with traceback information.\n\n   ```python\n   import logging\n   import traceback\n\n   logger = logging.getLogger('django')\n\n   try:\n       print(blah)\n   except KeyError as e:\n       # Log the exception with traceback\n       logger.error(\"KeyError occurred\", exc_info=True)\n   ```\n\n   The `exc_info=True` parameter ensures that the traceback is included in the log entry, which is useful for debugging.\n\nWith this setup, whenever a `KeyError` is raised, it will be logged into the specified log file along with the full traceback. Make sure that the path where the log file is stored is writable by the process running your Django application."
