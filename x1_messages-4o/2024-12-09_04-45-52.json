For example, when I use TypeVar('T', bound=Union[A, B]), the following code passes type checking. But when I use TypeVar('T', A, B), it fails with the error: \"Value of type variable 'T' of 'X' cannot be 'AA'. Can someone explain this to me?\n\n```python\nfrom typing import TypeVar, Union\n\nclass A: pass\nclass B: pass\n\nT = TypeVar(\"T\", A, B)\nT = TypeVar(\"T\", bound=Union[A, B])\n\nT = TypeVar(\"T\", bound=Union[A, B])\n\nclass AA(A):\n    pass\n\nclass X(Generic[T]):\n    pass\n\nclass XA(X[A]):\n    pass\n\nclass XAA(X[AA]):\n    pass\n```\n\nError:\n\n```\nerror: Value of type variable \"T\" of \"X\" cannot be \"AA\"\n```"

        "content": "The confusion here arises from the different ways `TypeVar` can be used to constrain types in Python.\n\n1. **`TypeVar('T', A, B)`**: This syntax defines a type variable `T` that can be either `A` or `B` directly. It is a specific constraint that limits `T` to be exactly either `A` or `B`, and not any subclass of `A` or `B`. This is why `X[AA]` fails, because `AA` is a subclass of `A`, not exactly `A`.\n\n2. **`TypeVar('T', bound=Union[A, B])`**: This syntax uses a `bound` to define `T` as a type variable that can be any subclass of `A` or `B` (or `A` or `B` themselves). This is more flexible, as it allows `T` to be `A`, `B`, or any subclass of them. Hence, `X[AA]` passes because `AA` is a subclass of `A`, which is allowed by the `bound=Union[A, B]`.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why the error occurs:\n\n- With `TypeVar('T', A, B)`, `T` is strictly limited to `A` or `B`. Any subclass, such as `AA`, is not directly considered `A`, and that's why `XAA(X[AA])` fails type checking.\n  \n- With `TypeVar('T', bound=Union[A, B])`, `T` can be any subclass of `A` or `B`, providing more flexibility. Thus, `XAA(X[AA])` passes because `AA` is a subclass of `A`.\n\nIn summary, if you want to allow subclasses of `A` and `B` in addition to `A` and `B` themselves, use `bound=Union[A, B]`. If you want to restrict `T` to be exactly `A` or `B`, use `TypeVar('T', A, B)`."
