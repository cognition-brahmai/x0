        "content": "To fetch records that contain a specific string pattern in a specified column of a table, you can use the `LIKE` operator in SQL. The `LIKE` operator is used in a `WHERE` clause to search for a specified pattern in a column. Here is a basic example of how you can write such a query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM your_table_name\nWHERE your_column_name LIKE '%your_pattern%';\n```\n\nIn this query:\n\n- `your_table_name` is the name of the table you are querying.\n- `your_column_name` is the name of the column you want to search for the pattern.\n- `your_pattern` is the specific string pattern you are looking for.\n\nThe `%` wildcard character is used to match zero or more characters. So, `%your_pattern%` will match any record that contains `your_pattern` anywhere in the specified column.\n\nIf you want to search for patterns that begin with a specific string, you can use `your_pattern%`. For patterns that end with a specific string, you can use `%your_pattern`."
