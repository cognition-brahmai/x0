I have a list named 'myarr' and I'm running a for loop on it, checking a condition 'somecond(a)' for every element 'a'. If the condition is true, I'm appending a new object to 'myarr'. The code seems to be working fine for now, but I'm not sure if it's just by chance and it might break in the future. To clarify, 'myarr' is large so I prefer not to copy it as it would be too slow. I also need to check the appended objects with 'somecond()'. Furthermore, 'somecond(a)' will eventually return false, so there's no risk of an infinite loop. The function 'somecond()' checks the size of each object in 'myarr'. Each new object appended to the list has a size smaller than 'a', and 'somecond()' has an epsilon for how small objects can be - if they're too small, it will return false. Here's the code snippet for reference:\n\n```python\n    for a in myarr:\n      if somecond(a):\n          myarr.append(newObj())\n```"

        "content": "Yes, it is possible to add elements to a list while iterating over it in Python, but it requires careful consideration of potential side effects, as it can lead to unexpected behavior. In your specific case, since you've mentioned that `somecond(a)` will eventually return false and prevent an infinite loop, you should generally be safe. However, it's important to understand the implications:\n\n1. **Iterating over a dynamic list**: When you modify a list (e.g., by appending elements) while iterating over it, the iterator does not automatically adjust to reflect the changes in the list's size. This means that the loop may not process newly appended elements if they are added after the current index.\n\n2. **Risk of infinite loops**: Although you mentioned that `somecond(a)` will eventually return false due to the size constraint, be cautious of scenarios where unexpected logic changes could lead to an infinite loop.\n\n3. **Performance considerations**: Since `myarr` is large, frequent appends can be computationally expensive, but you've indicated copying is not feasible due to size constraints.\n\nTo manage these aspects, you can use a `while` loop with an explicit index to have better control over the iteration and modifications:\n\n```python\ni = 0\nwhile i < len(myarr):\n    a = myarr[i]\n    if somecond(a):\n        myarr.append(newObj())\n    i += 1\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that every new object appended to `myarr` is checked by `somecond()`. The loop continues until all elements, including those appended during iteration, have been processed and `somecond()` returns false for each.\n\nAlways test your code thoroughly, especially when modifying a collection during iteration, to ensure it behaves as expected in different scenarios."
