The error suggests uninstalling mxnet and installing mxnet-cu90==1.1.0, adjusting 'cu90' based on the CUDA version. It also gives the option to disable GPU usage by invoking turicreate.config.set_num_gpus(0). Does Google Colab GPU not come with the CUDA Toolkit pre-installed? If not, how can I install CUDA in Google Colab GPU?"

        "content": "Google Colab does come with CUDA pre-installed, but the version of CUDA that is installed can vary. Typically, Colab is set up to work with TensorFlow, and the version of CUDA installed is meant to be compatible with the TensorFlow version available on Colab.\n\nHere's how you can handle the installation of MXNet with GPU support in Google Colab:\n\n1. **Check CUDA Version**: First, check the CUDA version available on the Colab instance.\n\n   ```python\n   !nvcc --version\n   ```\n\n2. **Install MXNet with CUDA**: Based on the CUDA version, you can install the appropriate version of MXNet. For example, if the CUDA version is 10.1, you would install `mxnet-cu101`.\n\n   ```python\n   # Example for CUDA 10.1\n   !pip uninstall -y mxnet\n   !pip install mxnet-cu101==1.6.0\n   ```\n\n   Adjust the `cuXXX` part according to the CUDA version you have.\n\n3. **Verify Installation**: After installation, verify that MXNet is using the GPU.\n\n   ```python\n   import mxnet as mx\n   print(mx.context.num_gpus())\n   ```\n\n   This should return a number greater than 0 if the GPU is being utilized.\n\n4. **Alternative - Disable GPU**: If you decide not to use the GPU, you can disable GPU usage by configuring MXNet.\n\n   ```python\n   import turicreate as tc\n   tc.config.set_num_gpus(0)\n   ```\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**: If you run into any version mismatches or other issues, you might need to restart your Colab runtime after installing the packages. This can be done from the menu: `Runtime > Restart runtime`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to install and use MXNet with GPU support in Google Colab."
