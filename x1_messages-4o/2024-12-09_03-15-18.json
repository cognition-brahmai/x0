I am having trouble figuring out how to break out of a loop in Python. I want to be able to transition from my turn to the computer's turn by using \"Q\" (quit) as a signal. Here is the code I have so far:\n\n```python\nans=(R)\nwhile True:\n    print('Your score is so far '+str(myScore)+'.')\n    print(\"Would you like to roll or quit?\")\n    ans=input(\"Roll...\")\n    if ans=='R':\n        R=random.randint(1, 8)\n        print(\"You rolled a \"+str(R)+\".\")\n        myScore=R+myScore\n    if ans=='Q':\n        print(\"Now I'll see if I can break your score...\")\n        break\n```\n\nHow can I correctly break out of this loop and transition to the computer's turn?"

        "content": "To break out of the loop and transition to the computer's turn when the user inputs \"Q\", you need to ensure that the input checking and loop logic are correct. Additionally, you should handle the import of the `random` module and initialize necessary variables such as `myScore`. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nmyScore = 0\n\nwhile True:\n    print('Your score so far is ' + str(myScore) + '.')\n    print(\"Would you like to roll (R) or quit (Q)?\")\n    ans = input(\"Your choice: \").strip().upper()  # Normalize input\n\n    if ans == 'R':\n        R = random.randint(1, 8)\n        print(\"You rolled a \" + str(R) + \".\")\n        myScore += R\n    elif ans == 'Q':\n        print(\"Now I'll see if I can break your score...\")\n        break\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter 'R' to roll or 'Q' to quit.\")\n\n# Add computer's turn logic here\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Initialization**: Ensure `myScore` is initialized before the loop starts.\n2. **Input Handling**: Normalize the user input using `strip()` and `upper()` to handle spaces and lowercase inputs.\n3. **Conditional Logic**: Use `elif` to check for quitting and provide feedback for invalid inputs.\n4. **Random Module**: Ensure the `random` module is imported at the beginning of your code.\n\nWith these changes, when the user types \"Q\", the loop will break, allowing you to add the computer's turn logic after the loop."
