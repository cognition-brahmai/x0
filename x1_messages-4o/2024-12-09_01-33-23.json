I'm aware that I can use `isinstance(x, str)` in Python 3, but I'm unsure if this will work as expected in Python 2. Specifically, in Python 2, the command `isinstance(u\"test\", str)` returns False. Also, Python 3 does not have `u\"foo\"`. Will I need to check the Python version and use `isinstance(x, basestr)`?"

        "content": "In Python 2 and 3, the handling of strings is indeed different, which can lead to compatibility issues if you're writing code intended to run on both versions. Here's a way to handle string type checking that works across both Python 2 and Python 3:\n\n1. **Python 2**: In Python 2, there are two types of strings: `str` (for byte strings) and `unicode` (for Unicode strings). The `basestr` type is a common base class for both `str` and `unicode`.\n\n2. **Python 3**: In Python 3, there is only one string type, `str`, which is Unicode. The `unicode` type from Python 2 becomes `str` in Python 3 and `basestr` is not available.\n\nTo handle both versions, you can do the following:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nif sys.version_info[0] < 3:  # Python 2\n    # Define a base string type that includes both str and unicode\n    string_types = (basestr,)\nelse:  # Python 3\n    # In Python 3, all strings are of type str\n    string_types = (str,)\n\n# Now you can use string_types to check:\nx = \"test\"\nif isinstance(x, string_types):\n    print(\"x is a string\")\nelse:\n    print(\"x is not a string\")\n```\n\nThis approach defines `string_types` as a tuple of the appropriate string types depending on the Python version, allowing you to use `isinstance()` for your checks without worrying about the version-specific differences."
