Currently, I am doing it in the following way:\n\n```python\nminN = 1\nmaxN = 10\nn = something() #some return value from a function\nn = max(minN, n)\nn = min(maxN, n)\n```\nThis method does limit 'n' between 'minN' and 'maxN' but I am not satisfied with the code's aesthetics. Is there a more efficient or cleaner way to achieve the same result?"

        "content": "Certainly! In Python, you can achieve the same result in a more concise way by using the `sorted` function, or by writing a simple custom function to encapsulate this logic. Here's how you can do it using both methods:\n\n### Using a Custom Function\nYou can create a custom function to encapsulate the logic of constraining a number within a specified range:\n\n```python\ndef clamp(value, min_value, max_value):\n    return max(min_value, min(max_value, value))\n\nminN = 1\nmaxN = 10\nn = something()  # some return value from a function\nn = clamp(n, minN, maxN)\n```\n\n### Using the `sorted` Function\nAnother elegant and readable way is to use Python's `sorted` function:\n\n```python\nminN = 1\nmaxN = 10\nn = something()  # some return value from a function\nn = sorted([minN, n, maxN])[1]\n```\n\nBoth methods provide a clean and efficient way to constrain `n` between `minN` and `maxN`. The custom `clamp` function is particularly useful if you need to perform this operation multiple times throughout your code, as it enhances readability and reusability."
