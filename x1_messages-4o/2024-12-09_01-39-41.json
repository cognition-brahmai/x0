        "content": "Certainly! Understanding import statements in Python, especially the changes from Python 2 to Python 3, can be quite important for writing clean and efficient code.\n\n### Relative Imports\n\nRelative imports allow you to import modules relative to the position of the current module. This is particularly useful in larger packages where the structure is important. \n\n#### Python 2\nIn Python 2, relative imports could be ambiguous because implicit relative imports were allowed. This means that if you had a package structure like this:\n\n```\nproject/\n    package/\n        __init__.py\n        module_a.py\n        module_b.py\n```\n\nIn `module_a.py`, you could import `module_b` using:\n\n```python\nimport module_b\n```\n\nThis would work if `module_b` was in the same directory as `module_a`. However, this can lead to issues if there were other modules named `module_b` elsewhere in the system path.\n\n#### Python 3\nIn Python 3, relative imports are explicit, meaning you must specify the relative path using a dot (`.`). Here\u2019s how you\u2019d do it:\n\n```python\nfrom . import module_b\n```\n\nThis makes it clear that you are importing `module_b` from the same package.\n\n### Star Imports\n\nStar imports allow you to import all public names from a module into the current namespace.\n\n#### Python 2\nIn Python 2, you could use star imports fairly liberally, like so:\n\n```python\nfrom module_b import *\n```\n\nThis would import all public functions, classes, and variables from `module_b` into the current module. However, this practice is generally discouraged because it can lead to unclear code and namespace pollution.\n\n#### Python 3\nIn Python 3, star imports are more restricted and are generally not allowed in function-level scopes. They're still allowed at the module level, but their use is discouraged unless you have a very specific reason, such as in interactive sessions or when working with certain legacy systems.\n\n### Example of Python 3 Star Import Restriction\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n\n```python\ndef my_function():\n    from module_b import *  # This will raise a SyntaxError in Python 3\n```\n\nIn Python 3, this is not allowed because it can lead to unpredictable behavior and makes it harder to determine the origins of variables and functions.\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Relative Imports**: Python 3 requires explicit relative imports, which makes the code more readable and avoids ambiguity.\n- **Star Imports**: Still permitted at the module level but discouraged due to potential namespace pollution; not allowed in local scopes like inside functions.\n\nThese changes encourage writing clearer, more maintainable code by making dependencies obvious and avoiding the pitfalls of name clashes."
