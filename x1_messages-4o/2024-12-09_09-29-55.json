        "content": "Creating an AI program specifically for checking balanced parentheses might be overkill, as this is a classic problem that can be efficiently solved with a simple algorithm using a stack. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how you can implement this in C++:\n\n### Algorithm Outline\n\n1. **Initialize a Stack**: Use a stack to keep track of opening parentheses.\n2. **Iterate Through the String**: Loop through each character in the string.\n   - If the character is an opening parenthesis (`(`, `{`, `[`), push it onto the stack.\n   - If it is a closing parenthesis (`)`, `}`, `]`), check if the stack is not empty and if the top of the stack is the matching opening parenthesis. If so, pop the stack. Otherwise, the parentheses are unbalanced.\n3. **Final Check**: After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, the parentheses are balanced. Otherwise, they are not.\n\n### C++ Implementation\n\nHere is a simple C++ program using the above algorithm:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <stack>\n#include <string>\n\nbool isBalanced(const std::string& str) {\n    std::stack<char> s;\n\n    for (char ch : str) {\n        if (ch == '(' || ch == '{' || ch == '[') {\n            s.push(ch);\n        } else if (ch == ')' || ch == '}' || ch == ']') {\n            if (s.empty()) {\n                return false;\n            }\n\n            char top = s.top();\n            if ((ch == ')' && top == '(') ||\n                (ch == '}' && top == '{') ||\n                (ch == ']' && top == '[')) {\n                s.pop();\n            } else {\n                return false;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    return s.empty();\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::string input;\n    std::cout << \"Enter a string with parentheses: \";\n    std::getline(std::cin, input);\n\n    if (isBalanced(input)) {\n        std::cout << \"The parentheses are balanced.\\n\";\n    } else {\n        std::cout << \"The parentheses are not balanced.\\n\";\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### How It Works\n\n- **Stack Operations**: The stack is used to keep track of unmatched opening parentheses.\n- **Matching Pairs**: For every closing parenthesis, the program checks if there is a corresponding unmatched opening parenthesis on top of the stack.\n- **Complexity**: The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string, as each character is processed once.\n\nThis solution efficiently checks for balanced parentheses and can be further extended to handle other types of brackets or more complex scenarios if needed."
