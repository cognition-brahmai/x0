I am aware that I can calculate the aspect ratio and set it manually, but I am wondering if there's a simpler method to achieve this?"

        "content": "Yes, there are ways to automatically adjust the size of a figure to fit the contained plots in Matplotlib, especially when dealing with subplots that have varying aspect ratios, such as heatmaps. Here are a few methods that might help you achieve this:\n\n1. **Tight Layout**:\n   Matplotlib has a built-in `tight_layout()` function that automatically adjusts subplot parameters to give specified padding. This can be a quick solution to ensure that your subplots fit nicely within the figure area without overlapping.\n\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n   fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n   # Your plotting code here\n   plt.tight_layout()\n   plt.show()\n   ```\n\n2. **Constrained Layout**:\n   Introduced in newer versions of Matplotlib, `constrained_layout` is another option that can help in automatically adjusting the subplots to fit within the figure area well. You can enable it by setting `constrained_layout=True` when creating your figure.\n\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n   fig, ax = plt.subplots(constrained_layout=True)\n   # Your plotting code here\n   plt.show()\n   ```\n\n3. **Aspect Ratio**:\n   If you are specifically dealing with heatmaps and you want them to have a specific aspect ratio, you can use the `aspect` parameter in the `imshow` function. Additionally, you can adjust the figure size based on the aspect ratio you calculate or derive from your data.\n\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n   import numpy as np\n\n   data = np.random.rand(10, 20)  # Example data\n   fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n   cax = ax.imshow(data, aspect='auto')  # Use 'auto', 'equal', or a specific ratio\n   fig.colorbar(cax)\n   plt.show()\n   ```\n\n4. **Manual Adjustment with `figsize`**:\n   If the above methods do not fully meet your needs, you can also adjust the figure size manually using `figsize` in the `plt.subplots()` function. By calculating the desired aspect ratio from your data and then setting the figure size accordingly, you can ensure that your subplots fit as you intend.\n\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n   import numpy as np\n\n   data = np.random.rand(10, 20)\n   aspect_ratio = data.shape[1] / data.shape[0]\n   fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 10 * aspect_ratio))\n   ax.imshow(data)\n   plt.show()\n   ```\n\nBy using these methods, you can ensure that your plots are displayed with the appropriate size and aspect ratio, reducing the need for manual adjustments."
