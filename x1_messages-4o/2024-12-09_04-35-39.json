I know about \"{0:,f}\".format(2083525.34561) which outputs commas but does not round, and \"%.2f\" % 2083525.34561 which rounds but does not add commas."

        "content": "In Python 2, you can achieve the desired formatting by combining string formatting techniques. You can first use the `round()` function to round your number to two decimal places, and then format it with commas using the `'{:,}'` string format method. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nnumber = 2083525.34561\n\n# Round the number to two decimal places\nrounded_number = round(number, 2)\n\n# Format the rounded number with commas\nformatted_number = '{:,.2f}'.format(rounded_number)\n\nprint(formatted_number)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n2,083,525.35\n```\n\nThis approach first rounds the number to two decimal places and then formats it with commas, giving you the desired output."
