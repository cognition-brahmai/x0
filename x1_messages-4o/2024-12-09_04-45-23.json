I've written an `__init__.py` file in a /flaskr/ directory, set up a virtual environment called 'venv' and installed Flask. After running the commands `export FLASK_APP=flaskr`, `export FLASK_ENV=development`, and `flask run` on the command line in the flaskr directory, I expected to see \"Hello, World!\" However, I'm getting an error that says \"flask.cli.NoAppException: Could not import \"flaskr.flaskr\". I'm not sure how to resolve this. Could it be a mismatch between what I've installed in the venv and what this project requires? My Flask version is 1.0.2, Pip version is 9.0.1 and Python version is 3.6.0."

        "content": "The error you're encountering, `flask.cli.NoAppException: Could not import \"flaskr.flaskr\"`, suggests that Flask is having trouble locating your application module. Here are some steps you can follow to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Directory Structure**: Ensure that your directory structure is correct. Your project should look something like this:\n\n   ```\n   /your_project_directory/\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 flaskr/\n   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 venv/\n   ```\n\n   Make sure the `__init__.py` file is inside the `flaskr` directory.\n\n2. **FLASK_APP Environment Variable**: Double-check that the `FLASK_APP` environment variable is set correctly. It should point to the package name, not the file. If you're already in the `your_project_directory`, you should use:\n\n   ```bash\n   export FLASK_APP=flaskr\n   ```\n\n   If you're on Windows, use `set` instead of `export`:\n\n   ```cmd\n   set FLASK_APP=flaskr\n   ```\n\n3. **Check `__init__.py`**: Make sure that your `__init__.py` file contains the necessary code to create a Flask application. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   from flask import Flask\n\n   def create_app():\n       app = Flask(__name__)\n\n       @app.route('/')\n       def hello():\n           return 'Hello, World!'\n\n       return app\n   ```\n\n4. **Activate Virtual Environment**: Ensure your virtual environment is activated. You should see `(venv)` in your command prompt. Activate it using:\n\n   ```bash\n   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux\n   ```\n\n   or \n\n   ```cmd\n   venv\\Scripts\\activate  # On Windows\n   ```\n\n5. **Install Flask**: Verify that Flask is installed in your virtual environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip list\n   ```\n\n   If Flask is not listed, install it using:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install Flask\n   ```\n\n6. **Re-run the Commands**: After ensuring all the above, try running the commands again:\n\n   ```bash\n   export FLASK_APP=flaskr\n   export FLASK_ENV=development\n   flask run\n   ```\n\n7. **Check for Typos**: Ensure there are no typos in your file or directory names.\n\n8. **Python Path**: If the problem persists, it might be related to the Python path. Sometimes, explicitly setting the Python path can help:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PYTHONPATH=.\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue. If the problem persists, double-check the tutorial and ensure that all steps have been followed as described."
