        "content": "To configure Black to exclude certain directories, such as the `migrations` folder, you need to ensure that both Black and pre-commit are configured correctly. Your `pyproject.toml` file seems almost correct, but there might be a few things to check or adjust to ensure that the exclusion works as expected.\n\n### Steps to Ensure Exclusion:\n\n1. **Regular Expression for Exclusion**:\n   - The regex in your `exclude` section should correctly match the paths you want to exclude. Your current regex `^migrations/` should work if the `migrations` directory is at the root of the project.\n   - You might want to use a more comprehensive pattern like `(^|/)migrations/` to ensure it matches `migrations` directories at any level.\n\n2. **Pre-commit Configuration**:\n   - Make sure your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file is set up to use Black and respects the `pyproject.toml` configuration.\n\n   Here\u2019s a basic example of a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` setup for Black:\n\n   ```yaml\n   repos:\n     - repo: https://github.com/psf/black\n       rev: stable\n       hooks:\n         - id: black\n           additional_dependencies: ['toml']  # Ensures Black reads pyproject.toml\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify Pre-commit Hook Setup**:\n   - Ensure that the pre-commit hook for Black is correctly installed. You can reinstall the hooks by running:\n     ```bash\n     pre-commit install\n     pre-commit autoupdate\n     ```\n\n4. **Run Black with Pre-commit**:\n   - When running `pre-commit run --all-files`, make sure that pre-commit is correctly reading the exclusions from your `pyproject.toml`.\n   - If it still formats `migrations`, try running Black directly to ensure the exclusion works without pre-commit:\n     ```bash\n     black --check .\n     ```\n\n5. **Check for Overriding Configurations**:\n   - Ensure there are no other configurations or command-line arguments being passed to Black that might override the `pyproject.toml` settings.\n\n6. **File Paths**:\n   - Double-check the file paths to confirm that the `migrations` directory is indeed the one being targeted for exclusion and not another directory with a similar name.\n\nBy ensuring that the regular expressions are correctly defined and that pre-commit is properly configured to use your `pyproject.toml`, Black should respect the exclusion directives for the `migrations` folder."
