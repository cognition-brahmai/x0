When I type in the following code snippet in IPython's QT console (on Windows 7), it provides basic documentation for the method, but when I do the same in PyCharm CE 3.4.1 with IPython enabled as my console, or in the editor, it doesn't display anything. Is there a way to resolve this issue?\n\n```python\nimport scipy\nscipy.zeros(\n```"

        "content": "To configure PyCharm to display method signatures and documentation in both the Python/IPython console and the editor, you can follow these steps:\n\n### In the Editor\n\n1. **Enable Quick Documentation**:\n   - Go to `File` > `Settings` (or `PyCharm` > `Preferences` on macOS).\n   - Navigate to `Editor` > `General` > `Code Completion`.\n   - Ensure that \"Show the documentation popup in\" is checked. This will display the documentation when you hover over a method or a class.\n\n2. **Use Parameter Info**:\n   - While typing in the editor, you can press `Ctrl + P` (or `Cmd + P` on macOS) to trigger the parameter info, which shows the method signature.\n\n3. **View Documentation**:\n   - You can view detailed documentation by placing the cursor on a method or class and pressing `Ctrl + Q` (or `F1` on macOS).\n\n### In the Python/IPython Console\n\n1. **Set Up IPython Console**:\n   - Make sure you have IPython installed. In the console, you can check this by typing `!pip show ipython`.\n\n2. **Use `?` and `??` for Documentation**:\n   - In the IPython console, you can use `?` or `??` to view documentation for an object. For example, typing `scipy.zeros?` will display the documentation.\n\n3. **Autocomplete and Introspection**:\n   - PyCharm's IPython console supports tab completion. You can type `scipy.zeros(` and then press `Tab` to see the method signature.\n\n4. **Ensure IPython is Properly Configured in PyCharm**:\n   - Go to `File` > `Settings` (or `PyCharm` > `Preferences` on macOS).\n   - Navigate to `Build, Execution, Deployment` > `Console` > `Python Console`.\n   - Ensure \"Use IPython if available\" is checked.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n- **Update PyCharm**: If you're still using PyCharm CE 3.4.1, consider updating to a newer version. Newer versions have improved support for these features.\n  \n- **Check Python Environment**: Ensure that the Python environment you are using in PyCharm has all necessary libraries installed.\n\n- **Reindex**: Sometimes PyCharm might need to reindex your project. You can invalidate caches by going to `File` > `Invalidate Caches / Restart`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to see method signatures and documentation in both the editor and the console within PyCharm, enhancing your coding experience."
