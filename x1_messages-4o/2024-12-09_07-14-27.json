In my case, `time1` should always be less than `time2`, so I am looking to assign `time1` the smallest possible value, representing the earliest possible moment. How can I achieve this?"

If you're looking to work with the earliest time in a comparable format, you can use `datetime.datetime.min`, which returns the earliest representable `datetime` object.\n\nHere's how you can assign `time1` to this earliest possible time:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef comp(time1, time2):\n    return time1 < time2\n\n# Assign the smallest possible datetime value to time1\ntime1 = datetime.min\n\n# Example usage with a specific time for time2\ntime2 = datetime(2023, 10, 1, 12, 0, 0)\n\n# Check if time1 is less than time2\nprint(comp(time1, time2))  # This will return True\n```\n\nIn this example, `datetime.min` represents the earliest moment (January 1, year 1, at 00:00:00). This ensures that `time1` is always less than any reasonable `time2` you'd compare it against, as long as `time2` is a valid datetime object."
