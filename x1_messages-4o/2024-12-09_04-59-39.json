Here's a simple way to achieve this in Python:\n\n```python\na = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nb = []\n\n# Use two pointers, one starting at the beginning and one at the end\nstart = 0\nend = len(a) - 1\n\n# Loop until the start pointer surpasses the end pointer\nwhile start <= end:\n    # Append from the start\n    b.append(a[start])\n    start += 1\n    # Check if there are still elements left to add from the end\n    if start <= end:\n        b.append(a[end])\n        end -= 1\n\nprint(b)\n```\n\nThis code will output the list `b` as `[0, 9, 1, 8, 2, 7, 3, 6, 4, 5]`, alternating elements from both ends of the list `a`."
