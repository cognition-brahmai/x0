        "content": "Certainly! Let's break down the task:\n\n1. **Find three consecutive Fibonacci numbers between 100 and 200.**\n2. **Check if their sum is a perfect square.**\n3. **Calculate the difference between the cube of the first Fibonacci number and the square of the third Fibonacci number.**\n\nHere's a Java program to achieve this:\n\n```java\npublic class FibonacciPerfectSquare {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int f1 = 0, f2 = 1, f3;\n        \n        while (true) {\n            f3 = f1 + f2;\n            \n            // Check if the numbers are in the range 100 to 200\n            if (f1 >= 100 && f3 <= 200) {\n                int sum = f1 + f2 + f3;\n                \n                // Check if the sum is a perfect square\n                if (isPerfectSquare(sum)) {\n                    int cubeF1 = f1 * f1 * f1;\n                    int squareF3 = f3 * f3;\n                    int difference = cubeF1 - squareF3;\n                    \n                    System.out.println(\"Fibonacci numbers: \" + f1 + \", \" + f2 + \", \" + f3);\n                    System.out.println(\"Sum: \" + sum);\n                    System.out.println(\"Difference between cube of first and square of third: \" + difference);\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n            \n            // Move to the next set of consecutive Fibonacci numbers\n            f1 = f2;\n            f2 = f3;\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static boolean isPerfectSquare(int num) {\n        int sqrt = (int) Math.sqrt(num);\n        return sqrt * sqrt == num;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### How the Program Works:\n\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Generation:** It starts with the first two Fibonacci numbers, `f1 = 0` and `f2 = 1`, and iteratively calculates the next Fibonacci number, `f3 = f1 + f2`.\n\n2. **Check Range:** It checks if the sequence of three numbers falls within the range of 100 to 200.\n\n3. **Perfect Square Check:** It calculates the sum of the three numbers and checks if it's a perfect square using the `isPerfectSquare` method.\n\n4. **Calculate Difference:** If the sum is a perfect square, it computes the cube of the first Fibonacci number and the square of the third, then finds their difference.\n\n5. **Output:** It prints the three Fibonacci numbers, their sum, and the calculated difference.\n\nThe program will stop at the first set of numbers that meet the criteria. You can run this code in any Java environment to see the exact output."
