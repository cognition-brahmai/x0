Here is the information we have:\n| Alpha | Bravo | Charlie |\n|-------|-------|---------|\n| Lie   | Truth | Truth   |\n|       | Lie   | Lie     |\n|       |       | Lie     |\nUsing this table, we can determine that Bravo tells the truth and Alpha and Charlie always lie. Therefore, the list in alphabetical order is Alpha, Bravo, Charlie."

Bravo tells the truth, while Alpha and Charlie always lie."
