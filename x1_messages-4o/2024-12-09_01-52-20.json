I am using the following code to write to a new file with a 'utf-16-le' encoding:\n\n```python\nfile_old = open('old.txt', mode='r', encoding='utf-8')\nfile_new = open('new.txt', mode='w', encoding='utf-16-le')\nfile_new.write(file_old.read())\n```\nThe code works fine, but it doesn't add a BOM to the new file. I need to convert the file to 'utf-16-le' encoding along with a BOM. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To add a Byte Order Mark (BOM) to a file with 'utf-16-le' encoding while writing in Python, you need to explicitly write the BOM at the beginning of the file. The BOM for 'utf-16-le' is `'\\ufeff'`. You can do this by writing the BOM to the file before writing any other content. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\n# Open the old file for reading with 'utf-8' encoding\nfile_old = open('old.txt', mode='r', encoding='utf-8')\n\n# Open the new file for writing with 'utf-16-le' encoding, but in binary mode\nfile_new = open('new.txt', mode='wb')\n\n# Write the BOM for 'utf-16-le' to the new file\nfile_new.write('\\ufeff'.encode('utf-16-le'))\n\n# Read the content from the old file\ncontent = file_old.read()\n\n# Write the content to the new file, encoding it in 'utf-16-le'\nfile_new.write(content.encode('utf-16-le'))\n\n# Close both files\nfile_old.close()\nfile_new.close()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `'\\ufeff'` is the Unicode character used as a BOM.\n- `file_new` is opened in binary mode (`wb`) because we are manually handling the encoding.\n- The BOM is written first using `file_new.write('\\ufeff'.encode('utf-16-le'))`.\n- The content of the old file is then read and encoded to 'utf-16-le' before being written to the new file.\n\nThis will ensure that your new file has both the 'utf-16-le' encoding and the appropriate BOM."
