        "content": "To achieve this, you can use a SQL query that involves conditional aggregation. Here's how you can write the query to separate the names based on whether they start with a vowel or a consonant:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    MAX(CASE WHEN LEFT(Name, 1) IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U') THEN Name END) AS \"Vowel Names\",\n    MAX(CASE WHEN LEFT(Name, 1) NOT IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U') THEN Name END) AS \"Consonant Names\"\nFROM (\n    SELECT Name,\n           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY CASE WHEN LEFT(Name, 1) IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U') THEN 'Vowel' ELSE 'Consonant' END ORDER BY ID) AS RowNum\n    FROM people\n) AS OrderedNames\nGROUP BY RowNum\nORDER BY RowNum;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Subquery with `ROW_NUMBER()`:** \n   - The subquery assigns a row number to each name within its category (vowel or consonant) using `ROW_NUMBER()`.\n   - It partitions the names into two categories using `CASE`: 'Vowel' or 'Consonant', based on the first letter of the name.\n   - This ensures that we can later group names and display them in separate columns.\n\n2. **Outer Query with Conditional Aggregation:**\n   - The outer query uses `MAX(CASE...)` to select names based on their initial letter.\n   - It checks if the initial letter of the name belongs to the set of vowels `('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U')`.\n   - Names starting with vowels are placed in the \"Vowel Names\" column, and others go into the \"Consonant Names\" column.\n   - `GROUP BY RowNum` ensures that each row of the result corresponds to a particular index of names in each category.\n\n3. **Ordering:**\n   - The final result is ordered by `RowNum` to maintain the sequence of names in their respective categories.\n\nThis query will give you the desired output with names distributed into two separate columns based on whether they start with a vowel or a consonant."
