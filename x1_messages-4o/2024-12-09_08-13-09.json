        "content": "In Python 2, `NoneType` could be referenced as a type within the `types` module, but in Python 3, `NoneType` is not explicitly available as a distinct type in the `types` module, which is why you're encountering the `ImportError`.\n\nIn Python 3, you can get the `NoneType` by using `type(None)`. Here's how you can update your code:\n\n```python\n# Remove the import that causes the error\n# import types\n# from types import NoneType\n\n# Instead, use type(None) directly where you need to reference NoneType\nnone_type = type(None)\n\n# Example usage\ndef check_none(value):\n    if isinstance(value, none_type):\n        print(\"The value is NoneType.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The value is not NoneType.\")\n```\n\nBy using `type(None)`, you can check for `NoneType` in Python 3 without needing to import it from the `types` module. This change should help you resolve the import error and adapt your code for compatibility with Python 3."
