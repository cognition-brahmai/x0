I want this data to be sent to another process or thread, since processing it could take a significant amount of time. However, when I try to run the code in the callback function, it ends up blocking. How can I properly spin off a new task to prevent this blocking?"

        "content": "To handle this situation effectively, you can use Python's `concurrent.futures` module, which provides a high-level interface for asynchronously executing callables using threads or processes. This can help you offload the processing of data to a separate thread or process, ensuring that your socket listener remains responsive.\n\nHere's an example using `ThreadPoolExecutor` from the `concurrent.futures` module to run tasks in separate threads:\n\n```python\nimport socket\nimport concurrent.futures\n\ndef process_data(data):\n    # Simulate a time-consuming task\n    print(f\"Processing data: {data}\")\n    # Add your processing logic here\n    # ...\n\ndef handle_client_connection(client_socket):\n    with client_socket:\n        while True:\n            data = client_socket.recv(1024)\n            if not data:\n                break\n            # Submit the processing task to the thread pool\n            executor.submit(process_data, data)\n\ndef start_server(host='127.0.0.1', port=65432):\n    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n    server_socket.bind((host, port))\n    server_socket.listen()\n\n    print(f\"Server listening on {host}:{port}\")\n\n    while True:\n        client_socket, addr = server_socket.accept()\n        print(f\"Accepted connection from {addr}\")\n        handle_client_connection(client_socket)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Create a ThreadPoolExecutor with a number of worker threads\n    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:\n        start_server()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **ThreadPoolExecutor**: This example uses a `ThreadPoolExecutor` to manage a pool of worker threads. You can adjust the `max_workers` parameter according to the expected load and available resources.\n\n2. **Non-blocking Server**: The server listens for incoming connections and handles each connection in the `handle_client_connection` function. The `executor.submit()` method is used to submit the `process_data` function to the thread pool for execution.\n\n3. **Socket Management**: The server socket is set up to listen for connections, and each client connection is handled in a loop where data is received and processed.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: Consider adding error handling and cleanup code to manage exceptions and ensure resources are properly released.\n\nAlternatively, if the processing tasks are CPU-bound, you might consider using `ProcessPoolExecutor` instead of `ThreadPoolExecutor` to take advantage of multiple CPU cores. This is more suitable for CPU-intensive tasks, but be aware of the overhead associated with inter-process communication."
