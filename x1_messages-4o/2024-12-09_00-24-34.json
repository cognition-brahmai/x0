I want to give users the ability to extend the capabilities of one of my modules through an interface that would call a user's function. I want users to be notified when an instance of a class is created and given the opportunity to modify the instance before it is used. I'm currently using a module-level factory function for instantiation but I'm not sure if this is the best approach. I want to keep it as simple as possible, without needing to chain more than one user callback or specify order or priorities. Is there a better, more idiomatic way to achieve this in Python?"

        "content": "Implementing hooks or callbacks in Python can be done in several ways, depending on your specific needs and the complexity of the system you're designing. Given your requirements for simplicity and not needing to chain multiple callbacks or manage order and priorities, here are a couple of idiomatic approaches you might consider:\n\n### 1. Using a Simple Callback Function\n\nOne straightforward approach is to allow the user to pass a callback function to your module or class. This function can be called at the appropriate point in your workflow, such as after an instance is created but before it is used.\n\nHere's a basic example:\n\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n    def __init__(self, data):\n        self.data = data\n\ndef create_instance(data, callback=None):\n    instance = MyClass(data)\n    if callback:\n        callback(instance)\n    return instance\n\n# Usage\ndef my_callback(instance):\n    # Modify the instance as needed\n    instance.data += \" modified\"\n\ninstance = create_instance(\"original data\", my_callback)\nprint(instance.data)  # Output: original data modified\n```\n\n### 2. Using Python Decorators for More Control\n\nIf you want to provide a bit more structure, consider using decorators to register callbacks. This can be particularly useful if you want users to register multiple callbacks or if you want to support more advanced features later.\n\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n    def __init__(self, data):\n        self.data = data\n\ncallback_registry = []\n\ndef register_callback(callback):\n    callback_registry.append(callback)\n    return callback\n\ndef create_instance(data):\n    instance = MyClass(data)\n    for callback in callback_registry:\n        callback(instance)\n    return instance\n\n# Usage\n@register_callback\ndef my_callback(instance):\n    instance.data += \" modified\"\n\ninstance = create_instance(\"original data\")\nprint(instance.data)  # Output: original data modified\n```\n\n### 3. Using Observer Pattern\n\nFor a more extensible solution that might be overkill for your current needs but is worth mentioning, you could implement an observer pattern. Python's native `weakref.WeakSet` can be used to manage subscribers without preventing garbage collection.\n\n```python\nimport weakref\n\nclass MyClass:\n    def __init__(self, data):\n        self.data = data\n\nclass InstanceNotifier:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._subscribers = weakref.WeakSet()\n\n    def subscribe(self, callback):\n        self._subscribers.add(callback)\n\n    def notify(self, instance):\n        for subscriber in self._subscribers:\n            subscriber(instance)\n\nnotifier = InstanceNotifier()\n\ndef create_instance(data):\n    instance = MyClass(data)\n    notifier.notify(instance)\n    return instance\n\n# Usage\ndef my_callback(instance):\n    instance.data += \" modified\"\n\nnotifier.subscribe(my_callback)\n\ninstance = create_instance(\"original data\")\nprint(instance.data)  # Output: original data modified\n```\n\nEach of these methods has its own advantages and can be adapted to fit more complex requirements as needed. The choice depends on how you foresee the module evolving and how much control you want to give to the users over the instantiation process."
