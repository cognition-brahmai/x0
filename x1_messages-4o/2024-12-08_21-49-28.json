        "content": "To achieve both email validation and verification of its existence on the server, as well as to ensure that the domain is not from a disposable email provider, you can use a combination of PHP functions and some additional logic. Below is a comprehensive approach to achieve these goals:\n\n1. **Validate the Email Format:** Use PHP's built-in filter to validate the email format.\n2. **Check MX Records:** Verify that the email domain has valid MX (Mail Exchange) records, which indicates that the domain can receive emails.\n3. **Verify the Email Server:** Try to establish a connection with the email server to verify the existence of the email address.\n4. **Check Against Disposable Email Providers:** Maintain a list of known disposable email domains and check the email against this list.\n\nHere's an example code snippet that illustrates this process:\n\n```php\n<?php\n\nfunction isDisposableEmail($domain) {\n    // List of known disposable email domains (this is a small sample, you need to expand it)\n    $disposableDomains = [\n        'mailinator.com',\n        '10minutemail.com',\n        'guerrillamail.com',\n        // Add more disposable domains here\n    ];\n\n    return in_array($domain, $disposableDomains);\n}\n\nfunction validateAndVerifyEmail($email) {\n    // Validate email format\n    if (!filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {\n        return \"Invalid email format.\";\n    }\n\n    // Extract domain from email\n    list(, $domain) = explode('@', $email);\n\n    // Check if the domain is a disposable email domain\n    if (isDisposableEmail($domain)) {\n        return \"Email is from a disposable email provider.\";\n    }\n\n    // Check MX records\n    if (!checkdnsrr($domain, 'MX')) {\n        return \"No MX records found for the domain.\";\n    }\n\n    // Verify email existence (optional and not always reliable)\n    $isValid = verifyEmailExistence($email);\n    if (!$isValid) {\n        return \"Email address does not exist on the server.\";\n    }\n\n    return \"Email is valid and exists.\";\n}\n\nfunction verifyEmailExistence($email) {\n    list($user, $domain) = explode('@', $email);\n    $mxhosts = [];\n    $mxweight = [];\n\n    if (!getmxrr($domain, $mxhosts, $mxweight)) {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    foreach ($mxhosts as $mxhost) {\n        $connect = @fsockopen($mxhost, 25, $errno, $errstr, 5);\n        if ($connect) {\n            if (preg_match(\"/^220/i\", $out = fgets($connect, 1024))) {\n                fputs($connect, \"HELO $domain\\r\\n\");\n                $out = fgets($connect, 1024);\n                fputs($connect, \"MAIL FROM: <check@$domain>\\r\\n\");\n                $out = fgets($connect, 1024);\n                fputs($connect, \"RCPT TO: <$email>\\r\\n\");\n                $out = fgets($connect, 1024);\n                fputs($connect, \"QUIT\\r\\n\");\n                fclose($connect);\n\n                if (preg_match(\"/^250/i\", $out)) {\n                    return true;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}\n\n// Usage example\n$email = \"test@example.com\";\n$result = validateAndVerifyEmail($email);\necho $result;\n\n?>\n```\n\n### Important Considerations:\n- **Accuracy:** SMTP verification may not be 100% reliable. Some servers may not respond to verification requests, or they may be configured to always accept email addresses to prevent spamming.\n- **Network Latency:** This process may take some time due to network requests, especially the SMTP verification part.\n- **Ethics and Legality:** Ensure that your use of this script complies with privacy laws and terms of service of email providers, as verifying email existence can be intrusive.\n- **Disposable Email List:** Continuously update your list of disposable email domains for better accuracy. You can find comprehensive lists online or use APIs that maintain such lists."
