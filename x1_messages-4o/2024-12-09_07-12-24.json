        "content": "In Keras, the `class_weight` parameter is used to handle unbalanced datasets by assigning different weights to classes during model training. This is particularly useful when you have a binary classification problem with skewed class distributions. Here's a simple way to apply `class_weight` in Keras for a binary classification problem:\n\n1. **Calculate Class Weights:**\n\n   You can manually calculate the class weights or use a utility function from scikit-learn. Here's how to do it using scikit-learn:\n\n   ```python\n   from sklearn.utils.class_weight import compute_class_weight\n   import numpy as np\n\n   # Assuming y_train is your target array\n   class_weights = compute_class_weight('balanced', classes=np.unique(y_train), y=y_train)\n\n   # Convert the class weights to a dictionary\n   class_weight_dict = {0: class_weights[0], 1: class_weights[1]}\n   ```\n\n2. **Apply Class Weights During Model Training:**\n\n   When you call the `fit` method on your Keras model, pass the `class_weight` parameter as follows:\n\n   ```python\n   model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, class_weight=class_weight_dict)\n   ```\n\nHere's a complete example:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.utils.class_weight import compute_class_weight\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Example dataset\nX_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)  # 100 samples, 10 features\ny_train = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=(100,), p=[0.1, 0.9])  # Binary target with imbalance\n\n# Calculate class weights\nclass_weights = compute_class_weight('balanced', classes=np.unique(y_train), y=y_train)\nclass_weight_dict = {0: class_weights[0], 1: class_weights[1]}\n\n# Build a simple model\nmodel = Sequential([\n    Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),\n    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')\n])\n\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Train the model with class weights\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, class_weight=class_weight_dict)\n```\n\nBy applying `class_weight`, you help the model give more importance to the minority class, which can improve performance on unbalanced datasets."
