Is there an equivalent feature in Python pip for managing and installing dependencies, or do I need to instruct users to install each dependency individually, as in 'pip install package1', 'pip install package2', before they can run my Python code?"

        "content": "Yes, Python's `pip` has a similar feature for managing and installing dependencies using a `requirements.txt` file. This file is used to list all the packages your project depends on, along with their specific versions if necessary.\n\nHere's how you can create and use a `requirements.txt` file:\n\n1. **Create the `requirements.txt` file**: You can generate this file automatically with the command `pip freeze > requirements.txt`. This will list all the installed packages and their versions in your current environment.\n\n2. **Format of `requirements.txt`**: The file should contain one package per line, optionally including version specifiers. For example:\n   ```\n   numpy==1.21.2\n   pandas>=1.3.0\n   requests\n   ```\n\n3. **Installing dependencies**: Once you have your `requirements.txt` file, users can install all the dependencies in one go by running:\n   ```\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\nThis makes it easy to manage your project's dependencies and ensure that others can set up the same environment quickly and consistently."
