Here's an example query that demonstrates how to achieve this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT city, COUNT(*) AS customer_count\nFROM customers\nGROUP BY city;\n```\n\nIn this query:\n\n- `SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS customer_count`: This selects the `city` column and counts the number of rows (customers) for each city. The result is aliased as `customer_count`.\n- `FROM customers`: This specifies the table from which you are selecting the data. Replace `customers` with the actual table name if it's different.\n- `GROUP BY city`: This groups the results by the `city` column, so you get a count of customers for each city.\n\nThis query will return a list of cities along with the number of customers in each city."
