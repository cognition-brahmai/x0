However, I'm running into a SyntaxError because \"async with\" is not supported in Python 3.4. I've tried replacing \"await\" with \"yield from\" and \"async def\" with a \"@coroutine decorator\" as suggested in the docs, but I still get a syntax error. How can I get the \"async with\" statement to work with Python 3.4?\n\nHere's the code I tried:\n\n```python\nimport aiohttp\nimport asyncio\n\n@asyncio.coroutine\ndef fetch(session, url):\n    with aiohttp.Timeout(10):\n        async with session.get(url) as response:\n            return (yield from response.text())\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n    with aiohttp.ClientSession(loop=loop) as session:\n        html = loop.run_until_complete(\n            fetch(session, 'http://python.org'))\n        print(html)\n```\n\nAnd here's the error message I get:\n\n```bash\n$ python3 client.py \n  File \"client.py\", line 7\n    async with session.get(url) as response:\n             ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n```"

        "content": "The `async with` statement and `async def` syntax were introduced in Python 3.5. Since you're using Python 3.4, you need to adapt your code to be compatible with the syntax and features available in that version. Here's how you can modify your code to work with Python 3.4:\n\n1. Replace `async with` and `await` with `yield from`.\n2. Use `@asyncio.coroutine` to define coroutines instead of `async def`.\n\nHere's a modified version of your code that should work with Python 3.4:\n\n```python\nimport aiohttp\nimport asyncio\n\n@asyncio.coroutine\ndef fetch(session, url):\n    with aiohttp.Timeout(10):\n        response = yield from session.get(url)\n        try:\n            text = yield from response.text()\n            return text\n        finally:\n            response.close()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n    session = aiohttp.ClientSession(loop=loop)\n    try:\n        html = loop.run_until_complete(\n            fetch(session, 'http://python.org'))\n        print(html)\n    finally:\n        session.close()\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n- Replace `async with session.get(url) as response:` with `response = yield from session.get(url)` and manually handle the response closing with a `finally` block.\n- Ensure that the `session` is properly closed by using a `try`...`finally` block around the session usage.\n\nThis code should now run without syntax errors in Python 3.4. Note that `aiohttp.Timeout` has been deprecated in later versions of `aiohttp`, so if you encounter any issues related to that, you might need to handle timeout differently or ensure you're using a compatible version of `aiohttp` for Python 3.4."
