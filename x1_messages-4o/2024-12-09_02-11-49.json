        "content": "The `xgboost.XGBClassifier` in the XGBoost library is used for classification tasks, and it provides several options for objective functions beyond the default `'binary:logistic'`. These objective functions help in optimizing the model for specific types of classification problems. Here are some of the options you can use:\n\n1. **`'binary:logistic'`**: This is the default option for binary classification problems. It returns class probabilities as output.\n\n2. **`'binary:logitraw'`**: Similar to `'binary:logistic'`, but instead of returning probabilities, it returns raw scores before they are transformed by the logistic function.\n\n3. **`'multi:softmax'`**: Used for multiclass classification problems. This objective function outputs the class with the highest predicted probability.\n\n4. **`'multi:softprob'`**: Also used for multiclass classification, but instead of outputting the predicted class, it outputs a vector of predicted probabilities for each class.\n\n5. **`'rank:pairwise'`**: Used for ranking tasks. It optimizes the pairwise loss, which is useful in learning to rank problems.\n\n6. **`'rank:ndcg'`**: Another objective function for ranking based on the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) metric.\n\n7. **`'rank:map'`**: Used for ranking based on Mean Average Precision (MAP).\n\n8. **`'reg:logistic'`**: This is similar to `'binary:logistic'`, but it's generally used in regression tasks.\n\n9. **`'reg:squarederror'`**: Although primarily for regression tasks, it can be used in classification settings where a squared error loss is desired.\n\n10. **Custom Objectives**: XGBoost also allows you to define custom objective functions if you have specific requirements that are not met by the built-in options.\n\nWhen choosing an objective function, it's important to consider the nature of your classification problem, such as whether it's binary or multiclass, and if there are any specific metrics or losses you want to optimize for."
