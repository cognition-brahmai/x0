However, I am facing a warning which states \"Assignment to reserved built-in symbol: type\". Is this warning indicative of an issue? If yes, what options do I have to resolve this? Are there any good alternatives to the term \"type\" that I can use without changing the meaning of the attribute? Here is the code for reference:\n\n```python\nclass Vehicle(models.Model):\n    TYPE = (\n        (u'car', u'Car'),\n        (u'motorcycle', u'Motorcycle'),\n        (u'airplane', u'Airplane'),\n    )\n\n    type = models.CharField(max_length=100, choices=TYPE)\n```"

        "content": "The warning you're encountering is due to the use of the word \"type\" as a field name in your Django model. In Python, \"type\" is a built-in function that is used to determine the type of an object or create new types. Using it as a field name can lead to confusion or unexpected behavior in your code because it shadows the built-in function.\n\nTo resolve this warning, you can rename the field to something that conveys the same meaning but doesn't conflict with Python's built-in functions. Here are a few alternatives you might consider:\n\n1. **vehicle_type**: This is more descriptive and avoids the ambiguity with the built-in `type` function.\n   ```python\n   class Vehicle(models.Model):\n       TYPE = (\n           (u'car', u'Car'),\n           (u'motorcycle', u'Motorcycle'),\n           (u'airplane', u'Airplane'),\n       )\n\n       vehicle_type = models.CharField(max_length=100, choices=TYPE)\n   ```\n\n2. **category**: This term is also commonly used to describe classifications or types.\n   ```python\n   class Vehicle(models.Model):\n       CATEGORY = (\n           (u'car', u'Car'),\n           (u'motorcycle', u'Motorcycle'),\n           (u'airplane', u'Airplane'),\n       )\n\n       category = models.CharField(max_length=100, choices=CATEGORY)\n   ```\n\n3. **kind**: A shorter alternative that still conveys the meaning of classification.\n   ```python\n   class Vehicle(models.Model):\n       KIND = (\n           (u'car', u'Car'),\n           (u'motorcycle', u'Motorcycle'),\n           (u'airplane', u'Airplane'),\n       )\n\n       kind = models.CharField(max_length=100, choices=KIND)\n   ```\n\n4. **classification**: A more formal term that clearly indicates a categorization.\n   ```python\n   class Vehicle(models.Model):\n       CLASSIFICATION = (\n           (u'car', u'Car'),\n           (u'motorcycle', u'Motorcycle'),\n           (u'airplane', u'Airplane'),\n       )\n\n       classification = models.CharField(max_length=100, choices=CLASSIFICATION)\n   ```\n\nChoosing one of these alternatives will help you avoid the warning while maintaining clarity in your code. Remember to update any references to the field in your codebase if you decide to change the name."
