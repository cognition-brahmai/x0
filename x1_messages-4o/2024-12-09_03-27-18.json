When I try to raise a number to a certain power using the operator ^, it doesn't give me the expected answer. For instance, when I try 'print 8^3', the output is 11, but I anticipate the output to be 512. Can someone explain why 'print 8^3' doesn't equal 512 and what instance would 11 be the result of 8^3?"

        "content": "In Python, the confusion arises because the `^` operator is not the exponentiation operator; it is actually the bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator. To raise a number to a power, you should use the `**` operator.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of what happens with `8^3`:\n\n- The number 8 in binary is `1000`.\n- The number 3 in binary is `0011`.\n- The bitwise XOR operation compares each bit of the binary representations of the numbers. If the bits are the same, the result is `0`. If the bits are different, the result is `1`.\n\n```\n  1000  (binary for 8)\n^ 0011  (binary for 3)\n------\n  1011  (binary for 11)\n```\n\nSo, `8^3` results in `11`, which is the decimal representation of the binary number `1011`.\n\nTo correctly raise 8 to the power of 3, use the `**` operator:\n\n```python\nprint(8**3)  # This will output 512\n```\n\nThis will give you the expected result of 512."
