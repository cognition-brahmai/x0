        "content": "To extract the domain `hostname.com` from the URL `http://abc.hostname.com/somethings/anything/` in Python, you can use the `tldextract` library. This library is compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. First, you need to install the `tldextract` library if you haven't already. You can do this using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install tldextract\n   ```\n\n2. Then, you can use the following code to extract the domain:\n\n   ```python\n   import tldextract\n\n   url = \"http://abc.hostname.com/somethings/anything/\"\n   extracted = tldextract.extract(url)\n   domain = \"{}.{}\".format(extracted.domain, extracted.suffix)\n\n   print(domain)  # Output: hostname.com\n   ```\n\nThis code first uses `tldextract.extract()` to parse the URL into its components: subdomain, domain, and suffix. It then combines the domain and suffix to get `hostname.com`.\n\nThis method is robust and works well with various types of URLs, including those with different subdomains and suffixes."
