I want to apply a function to all rows of a specific column in this DataFrame, which contains a bunch of 'datetime.datetime' objects. I'm trying to generate a column of the total number of seconds for each of the rows. The function I'm trying to use is:\n\n```python\ndf['col'].apply(lambda x, y:(x - y).total_seconds(), args=[d1], axis=1)\n```\n\nHere, 'd1' is the earliest datetime. However, I keep getting the following error:\n\n```python\nTypeError: <lambda>() got an unexpected keyword argument 'axis'\n```\n\nI can't figure out why 'axis' is getting passed to my lambda function. I also tried defining a separate function like this:\n\n```python\ndef diff_dates(d1, d2):\n    return (d1-d2).total_seconds()\n\ndf['col'].apply(diff_dates, args=[d1], axis=1)\n```\n\nBut I still get the same error. Can someone please help me understand what I'm doing wrong?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that the `apply` method for a Pandas Series (which is what you're using when you do `df['col'].apply(...)`) does not accept an `axis` argument. The `axis` parameter is used when you apply a function across a DataFrame, not a Series. In your case, since you're applying the function to a single column (a Series), you don't need to specify `axis`.\n\nYou can fix this by simply removing the `axis` argument. Here's how you can apply the lambda function correctly:\n\n```python\ndf['seconds'] = df['col'].apply(lambda x: (x - d1).total_seconds())\n```\n\nOr if you're using the separate function:\n\n```python\ndf['seconds'] = df['col'].apply(diff_dates, args=[d1])\n```\n\nBoth of these approaches will create a new column in your DataFrame called 'seconds', which contains the total number of seconds for each row calculated from the difference between the datetime in 'col' and `d1`.\n\nLet me know if you need further clarification or assistance!"
