The array should also include elements for the next day and the day after. The start time should be adjusted such that if the current time is greater than the start time, the array should still generate 15 minute intervals until 9 pm, and then proceed to generate for the next day and the day after that. The intervals should be exactly at 15 minute marks, like 7:00, 7:15, etc., and not at arbitrary times like 7:12 or 8:32."

        "content": "To generate a time interval array in Python that satisfies your requirements, you can use the `datetime` module. Here's a step-by-step implementation:\n\n1. Determine the current time.\n2. Adjust the start time accordingly.\n3. Generate 15-minute intervals from the adjusted start time to 9:00 PM.\n4. Repeat step 3 for the next two days.\n\nHere's the code implementing the above logic:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, time\n\ndef generate_time_intervals():\n    # Get the current time in UTC\n    now = datetime.utcnow()\n\n    # Define the start and end times in Zulu time\n    start_time = time(7, 0)  # 7:00 AM\n    end_time = time(21, 0)   # 9:00 PM\n\n    # Adjust the start date to today at 7:00 AM\n    start_datetime = datetime.combine(now.date(), start_time)\n\n    # If the current time is already past the start time, adjust the start_datetime\n    if now.time() > start_time:\n        start_datetime = start_datetime + timedelta(days=1)\n\n    # Initialize the list to store time intervals\n    time_intervals = []\n\n    # Generate intervals for today, tomorrow, and the day after\n    for day_offset in range(3):\n        current_day = start_datetime + timedelta(days=day_offset)\n        current_time = datetime.combine(current_day.date(), start_time)\n\n        # Create intervals from start to end time for the current day\n        while current_time.time() <= end_time:\n            time_intervals.append(current_time.strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'))\n            current_time += timedelta(minutes=15)\n\n    return time_intervals\n\n# Generate and print the time interval array\nintervals = generate_time_intervals()\nfor interval in intervals:\n    print(interval)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Current Time**: We start by obtaining the current time in UTC using `datetime.utcnow()`.\n- **Start/End Times**: Define the start time as 7:00 AM and the end time as 9:00 PM.\n- **Adjustment**: If the current time is later than 7:00 AM, we adjust the start to be the next day at 7:00 AM.\n- **Interval Generation**: Loop through three days starting from the adjusted start date, generating 15-minute intervals until 9:00 PM for each day.\n- **Output**: The intervals are formatted in Zulu time (`UTC`) and stored in a list as strings.\n\nThis code will generate and print a list of timestamps in Zulu time at 15-minute intervals, starting from the adjusted start time and covering the next two days as well."
