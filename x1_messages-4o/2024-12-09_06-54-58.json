I would like to save the model before it begins to overfit. My training code is as follows:\n\n```python\ntrain_step = ......\nsummary = tf.scalar_summary(l1_loss.op.name, l1_loss)\nsummary_writer = tf.train.SummaryWriter(\"checkpoint\", sess.graph)\nsaver = tf.train.Saver()\nfor i in xrange(20000):\n    batch = get_next_batch(batch_size)\n    sess.run(train_step, feed_dict = {x: batch.x, y:batch.y})\n    if (i+1) % 100 == 0:\n        saver.save(sess, \"checkpoint/net\", global_step = i+1)\n        summary_str = sess.run(summary, feed_dict=validation_feed_dict)\n        summary_writer.add_summary(summary_str, i+1)\n        summary_writer.flush()\n```\n\nHowever, after the training finishes, I only have five checkpoints saved (19600, 19700, 19800, 19900, 20000). Is there a way to configure Tensorflow to save the checkpoint according to the validation error? \n\nI'm aware that `tf.train.Saver` has a `max_to_keep` argument that could potentially save all the checkpoints, but I would prefer the saver to keep only the checkpoint with the smallest validation loss so far. Is this possible?"

        "content": "Yes, you can configure TensorFlow to save the checkpoint with the smallest validation loss so far by implementing a custom checkpointing mechanism. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Track the Best Validation Loss**: Keep track of the best validation loss encountered during training.\n\n2. **Conditionally Save the Model**: Save the model only if the current validation loss is less than the best validation loss recorded so far.\n\n3. **Use a Custom Saving Logic**: Modify your training loop to include this logic.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to implement these steps:\n\n```python\ntrain_step = ......\nsummary = tf.scalar_summary(l1_loss.op.name, l1_loss)\nsummary_writer = tf.train.SummaryWriter(\"checkpoint\", sess.graph)\nsaver = tf.train.Saver()\n\nbest_val_loss = float('inf')  # Initialize best validation loss to infinity\n\nfor i in xrange(20000):\n    batch = get_next_batch(batch_size)\n    sess.run(train_step, feed_dict = {x: batch.x, y: batch.y})\n    \n    if (i+1) % 100 == 0:\n        # Calculate validation loss\n        val_loss = sess.run(l1_loss, feed_dict=validation_feed_dict)\n        \n        # Save the model if the current validation loss is the best we've seen so far\n        if val_loss < best_val_loss:\n            best_val_loss = val_loss\n            saver.save(sess, \"checkpoint/best_model\", global_step=i+1)\n        \n        # Log the summary\n        summary_str = sess.run(summary, feed_dict=validation_feed_dict)\n        summary_writer.add_summary(summary_str, i+1)\n        summary_writer.flush()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`best_val_loss`**: This variable keeps track of the lowest validation loss seen so far.\n- **Validation Loss Calculation**: We calculate the validation loss every 100 iterations (you can adjust this frequency as needed).\n- **Conditional Saving**: The model is saved only if the current validation loss is lower than the `best_val_loss`. This ensures that only the model with the best performance on the validation set is retained.\n- **Checkpoint Name**: The checkpoint is saved with the name \"best_model\" to indicate that it contains the best model parameters.\n\nThis approach ensures that you keep only the model with the best validation performance, preventing overfitting while also reducing storage usage by not saving every single checkpoint."
