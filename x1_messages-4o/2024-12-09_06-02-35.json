Here's the line of code that's causing the issue:\n\n```python\ni = 3\na = 2 if i in [1, 3, 6] else a = 7\n```\n\nWhen expanded as below, it works fine:\n\n```python\nif i in [1, 3, 6]:\n    a = 2\nelse:\n    a = 7\n```"

        "content": "The error you are encountering is due to incorrect usage of the conditional (ternary) expression in Python. In Python, a conditional expression is used to return a value based on a condition, and it has a specific syntax:\n\n```python\na = value_if_true if condition else value_if_false\n```\n\nIn your original code:\n\n```python\na = 2 if i in [1, 3, 6] else a = 7\n```\n\nThe issue arises because you are trying to assign values in both the true and false parts of the expression, which is not allowed. A conditional expression in Python can only evaluate to a value and cannot include assignment statements within it.\n\nTo correct this, you should use the conditional expression to assign the result directly to `a`, as shown below:\n\n```python\na = 2 if i in [1, 3, 6] else 7\n```\n\nThis line of code evaluates the condition `i in [1, 3, 6]`. If it is `True`, `a` is assigned the value `2`; if it is `False`, `a` is assigned the value `7`. \n\nYour expanded version works because it uses an `if-else` statement, which allows assignments within each block. In contrast, a conditional expression is designed to return a single value, not perform multiple assignments."
