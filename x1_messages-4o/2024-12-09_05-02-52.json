For a one-dimensional list, I can just use the slice notation like this:\n\n```python\na = [1, 2]\nb = a[:]\n```\n\nHowever, for a two-dimensional list like this:\n\n```python\na = [[1, 2],[3, 4]]\nb = a[:]\n```\n\nWhen I modify list `b`, list `a` also gets modified. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "To copy a two-dimensional list in Python such that modifying one list does not affect the other, you'll need to perform a deep copy. This is because a simple slice or shallow copy will only copy the references to the inner lists, not the inner lists themselves.\n\nYou can achieve a deep copy by using the `copy` module which provides a `deepcopy` function. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport copy\n\na = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]\nb = copy.deepcopy(a)\n\n# Now modify b\nb[0][0] = 10\n\n# a remains unchanged\nprint(\"a:\", a)  # Output: a: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]\nprint(\"b:\", b)  # Output: b: [[10, 2], [3, 4]]\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can manually create a deep copy by using a list comprehension if you prefer not to use the `copy` module:\n\n```python\na = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]\nb = [row[:] for row in a]\n\n# Now modify b\nb[0][0] = 10\n\n# a remains unchanged\nprint(\"a:\", a)  # Output: a: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]\nprint(\"b:\", b)  # Output: b: [[10, 2], [3, 4]]\n```\n\nBoth methods ensure that `b` is a separate copy of `a`, and changes to `b` do not affect `a`."
