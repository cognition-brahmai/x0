        "content": "In Python 2, both `pickle` and `cPickle` modules are used for serialization (also known as pickling) of Python objects, but there are some differences between them:\n\n1. **Performance**: As you noted, `cPickle` is faster than `pickle` because `cPickle` is implemented in C, whereas `pickle` is implemented in Python. This makes `cPickle` the preferred choice when performance is a concern.\n\n2. **Interface**: The interfaces of `pickle` and `cPickle` are mostly the same, so you can generally swap one for the other without much change in your code.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: One notable difference is in error messages and handling. The `pickle` module provides more detailed error messages because it's written in Python and can provide more context in exceptions. This can be useful for debugging purposes.\n\n4. **Subclassing**: If you need to subclass the pickler or unpickler for custom serialization behavior, you should use `pickle`, as `cPickle` doesn\u2019t support subclassing due to its implementation in C.\n\nIn most cases, you would choose `cPickle` for its performance benefits. However, if you are developing a complex application where detailed error messages or subclassing is necessary, you might opt for `pickle`.\n\nIn Python 3, the distinction is removed, as the `pickle` module incorporates the speed of `cPickle`, and there is no separate `cPickle` module."
