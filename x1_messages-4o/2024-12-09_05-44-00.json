Type 'manage.py help' for usage.\" However, when I run `manage.py help` I don't see a command that could replace `python manage.py syncdb`. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The `syncdb` command was removed in Django 1.9. To create tables for your models in the database, you should use the `migrate` command instead. Here's how you can proceed:\n\n1. **Make Migrations**: First, you need to create migration files for your models. Run the following command to generate these files:\n\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py makemigrations\n   ```\n\n   This command will create migration files for any changes you have made to your models.\n\n2. **Apply Migrations**: After creating the migration files, apply them to the database with the `migrate` command:\n\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py migrate\n   ```\n\n   This command will apply the migrations and create the necessary tables in your database.\n\nThese steps will ensure that your database schema is in sync with your Django models. If you encounter any specific errors during these steps, please let me know so I can help you troubleshoot further."
