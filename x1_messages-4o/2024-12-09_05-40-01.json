I have 10 lines of text in a file named \"new.txt\", for example \"Adam:8154\", \"George:5234\", and so on. I want to create a new text file that only contains the names, \"Adam\", \"George\", etc. However, the code I am using only writes the 10th name into the new file \"xyz.txt\". Here's the snippet of the code:\n\n```\ntext_file = open(\"new.txt\", \"r\")\nlines = text_file.readlines()\n\nfor line in lines:\n  var1, var2 = line.split(\",\");\n  myfile = open('xyz.txt', 'w')\n  myfile.writelines(var1)\n  myfile.close()\n\ntext_file.close()\n```\n\nHow can I modify this code to write all the 10 names into a single text file \"xyz.txt\"?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to opening the file `xyz.txt` in write mode (`'w'`) inside the loop. Each time you open the file in write mode, it overwrites the contents with the new data. To fix this, you should open the file once, before the loop starts, and keep it open in append mode (`'a'`) so that each name is added to the end of the file.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\n# Open the input file for reading\ntext_file = open(\"new.txt\", \"r\")\nlines = text_file.readlines()\n\n# Open the output file once in write mode before the loop\nwith open('xyz.txt', 'w') as myfile:\n    for line in lines:\n        var1, var2 = line.split(\":\")  # Split by ':' instead of ',' as per your example\n        myfile.write(var1 + \"\\n\")     # Write the name and add a newline character\n\n# Close the input file after processing\ntext_file.close()\n```\n\nChanges made:\n1. Opened `xyz.txt` once outside the loop in write mode (`'w'`).\n2. Used `write()` instead of `writelines()` because `write()` is more appropriate for writing a single string at a time.\n3. Added a newline character `\\n` after each name to ensure each name is written on a new line in the output file.\n4. Used a context manager (`with` statement) for opening `xyz.txt`, which automatically handles closing the file."
