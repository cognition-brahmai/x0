I am currently using np.append which is not efficient since it needs to return a copy of the array instead of modifying the array in-place. Here is my current implementation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nret = np.array([])\nfor i in range(100000):\n  tmp =  get_input(i)\n  ret = np.append(ret, np.zeros(len(tmp)))\n  ret = np.append(ret, np.ones(fixed_length))\n```\nI am looking to implement something like this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom somewhere import np_extend\nret = np.array([])\nfor i in range(100000):\n  tmp =  get_input(i)\n  np_extend(ret, np.zeros(len(tmp)))\n  np_extend(ret, np.ones(fixed_length))\n```\n\nIs there any way to achieve this?"

        "content": "To efficiently extend a NumPy array in a manner similar to Python's list `extend` method, you can preallocate a larger array and keep track of the current length. This approach avoids creating a new array each time, which is what `np.append` does. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n1. Preallocate an array with a size that is large enough to accommodate all potential additions.\n2. Use a pointer to keep track of the current position in the array.\n3. Add new elements by slicing the preallocated array.\n\nHere is a sample implementation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef np_extend(arr, new_data, current_length):\n    new_length = current_length + len(new_data)\n    arr[current_length:new_length] = new_data\n    return new_length\n\n# Estimate the total size needed. Here, I'm assuming you know how much space you need.\nestimated_size = 1000000\nret = np.empty(estimated_size)\ncurrent_length = 0\n\nfor i in range(100000):\n    tmp = get_input(i)\n    new_data_zeros = np.zeros(len(tmp))\n    new_data_ones = np.ones(fixed_length)\n    \n    # Extend with zeros\n    current_length = np_extend(ret, new_data_zeros, current_length)\n    \n    # Extend with ones\n    current_length = np_extend(ret, new_data_ones, current_length)\n\n# Trim the array to the actual size used\nret = ret[:current_length]\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Preallocation**: Allocate an array larger than needed initially and slice it down to size after all insertions. This minimizes overhead.\n- **Tracking Length**: Keep track of the current length to know where to insert the next batch of data.\n- **Efficiency**: By preallocating and slicing, you avoid the overhead of repeatedly copying and resizing the array.\n\nThis approach is efficient and mimics the behavior of extending a list but in the context of NumPy arrays. Adjust the `estimated_size` based on the expected size of your data to avoid running out of space."
