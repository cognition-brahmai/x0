When I first import scipy using `import scipy as sp` and try to access `sp.special`, I receive an AttributeError indicating that the 'module' object has no attribute 'special'. However, when I subsequently import `scipy.special`, I can access the special module through both `scipy.special` and `sp.special`. Why does the 'special' module not import the first time around? And how can I get access to the 'special' module through the 'sp' namespace only, without defining the 'scipy' namespace? I am currently using Python 2.7.2 and scipy 0.10.1."

        "content": "The behavior you're experiencing is due to how Python imports and namespaces work. When you import a package using `import scipy as sp`, Python only initializes the top-level `scipy` module and does not automatically import all of its submodules like `scipy.special`. This is a common behavior in Python to optimize the import process, especially for large packages like SciPy, which contain many submodules.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening:\n\n1. **Initial Import**: When you use `import scipy as sp`, Python loads the `scipy` module and assigns it to the alias `sp`. At this point, `sp` only contains the top-level attributes of `scipy`, and its submodules like `special` are not yet imported.\n\n2. **Accessing Submodules**: When you try to access `sp.special` immediately after the initial import, it raises an `AttributeError` because `special` has not been imported yet.\n\n3. **Subsequent Import**: When you explicitly import `scipy.special` using `import scipy.special`, Python loads the `special` submodule. After this import, both `scipy.special` and `sp.special` become accessible because `sp` and `scipy` refer to the same module object, and importing `scipy.special` adds it as an attribute to this object.\n\nTo access `scipy.special` through only the `sp` namespace without directly using the `scipy` namespace, you can perform the imports in the following sequence:\n\n```python\nimport scipy as sp\nimport scipy.special\n\n# Now you can access the special module through sp\nprint(sp.special)  # This will work\n```\n\nUnfortunately, due to the way Python handles imports, you cannot avoid importing `scipy.special` explicitly if you want to access it through the `sp` namespace. The workaround is to import `scipy.special` explicitly after `import scipy as sp`.\n\nIf you're working in an environment where you prefer not to use `scipy` at all, you could consider directly importing `special` into your namespace like this:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy import special as sp_special\n\n# Now you can use sp_special to refer to scipy.special\nprint(sp_special)\n```\n\nThis way, you can avoid using the `scipy` namespace altogether and refer to `special` using the alias `sp_special`."
