        "content": "Design a comprehensive survey questionnaire to evaluate the overall satisfaction of electric vehicle customers. The questionnaire should consist of three sections: \n1. Demographic information of the respondents, including their age, gender, income, and education level. \n2. Usage patterns of the electric vehicle, including the frequency of charging, the distance traveled, and the type of usage (e.g., personal or commercial). \n3. Customer satisfaction with electric vehicles, including the performance, reliability, charging infrastructure, and customer service. \nIn addition to the traditional question formats, the survey should also include open-ended questions, multiple-choice questions, and Likert scale questions. Moreover, the survey should be available in multiple languages and formats, such as online, paper, and phone. \nTo ensure the validity and reliability of the survey, pilot testing should be conducted with a sample of electric vehicle customers. The pilot testing should evaluate the clarity, comprehensiveness, and relevance of the survey questions. \nFinally, the survey results should be analyzed using statistical methods, such as factor analysis, regression analysis, and correlation analysis. The results should be presented in a comprehensive report, including tables, graphs, and charts, and should be disseminated to the stakeholders, such as electric vehicle manufacturers, policymakers, and consumers."
