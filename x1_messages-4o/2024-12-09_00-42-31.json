        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to how TensorFlow interprets the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable and assigns GPU devices. The `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable is used to control which GPUs are visible to your application. By setting `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2`, you are telling CUDA (and by extension TensorFlow) to only expose the GPU with index 2 to your application. However, TensorFlow will then map this visible GPU to `/gpu:0` within the context of your application, as it only sees one GPU.\n\nHere's how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check GPU Indexing**: Ensure that the GPU you want to use is indeed at index 2. You can list all available GPUs and their indices using `nvidia-smi`.\n\n2. **Set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` Correctly**: If you want to use the third GPU, make sure that it's correctly indexed as 2 in the list provided by `nvidia-smi`. If the indices are different, adjust the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` accordingly.\n\n3. **TensorFlow Device Mapping**: Understand that TensorFlow remaps the visible GPU(s) to start from `/gpu:0`. So if you set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2`, TensorFlow sees only one GPU and maps it to `/gpu:0`, regardless of its original index.\n\n4. **Clearing Device Specification**: If your script explicitly specifies `/device:GPU:2`, you need to change it to `/device:GPU:0` because, under `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2`, the GPU is now mapped to `/gpu:0`.\n\n5. **Example**: If you have the following code snippet:\n   ```python\n   with tf.device('/device:GPU:2'):\n       # Your code here\n   ```\n   Change it to:\n   ```python\n   with tf.device('/device:GPU:0'):\n       # Your code here\n   ```\n\n6. **Verify Configuration**: After making these changes, verify by running the script and checking the logs to ensure TensorFlow is using the correct GPU. You can also add some debug prints or use TensorFlow\u2019s logging to confirm GPU usage.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error and have TensorFlow use the correct GPU as intended."
