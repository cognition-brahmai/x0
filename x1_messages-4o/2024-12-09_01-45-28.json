        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that you don't have the necessary build tools installed to compile psycopg2 from source. Here's how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Install Required Build Tools and Libraries:**\n   To build psycopg2 from source, you need a C compiler and the PostgreSQL development libraries. Follow these steps based on your operating system:\n\n   - **macOS:**\n     - Install Xcode Command Line Tools if not already installed:\n       ```bash\n       xcode-select --install\n       ```\n     - Install PostgreSQL and its development libraries via Homebrew:\n       ```bash\n       brew install postgresql\n       ```\n\n   - **Ubuntu/Debian:**\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt-get update\n     sudo apt-get install build-essential libpq-dev\n     ```\n\n   - **Fedora/RHEL/CentOS:**\n     ```bash\n     sudo dnf install gcc postgresql-devel\n     ```\n\n2. **Install psycopg2-binary:**\n   Instead of compiling psycopg2 from source, you can install the pre-compiled binary package which is much simpler and avoids these issues:\n   ```bash\n   pip install psycopg2-binary\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify Installation:**\n   After installation, verify that psycopg2 is installed correctly by running the following command in your Python environment:\n   ```python\n   import psycopg2\n   print(psycopg2.__version__)\n   ```\n\n4. **Update Your Project's Requirements:**\n   If you are using a `requirements.txt` file, replace `psycopg2` with `psycopg2-binary` to ensure consistency across environments.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error and get your Django project running with PostgreSQL."
