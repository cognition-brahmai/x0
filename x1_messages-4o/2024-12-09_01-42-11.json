        "content": "I am running a Python script that is leading to an IOError: [Errno 28] No space left on device: '../results/32766.html'. The error is peculiar because the script runs fine on a different machine. Additionally, the script has already successfully written over 30,000 files on the problem machine. The issue occurs when I am writing to an external hard drive. Here's the code that's causing the error:\n\n```python\nnPage = 0\nwhile nPage != -1:\n    for d in data:\n        if len(d.contents) > 1:\n            if '<script' in str(d.contents):\n                l = str(d.contents[1])\n                start = l.find('http://')\n                end = l.find('>',start)\n                out = get_records.openURL(l[start:end])\n                print COUNT\n\n                with open('../results/'+str(COUNT)+'.html','w') as f:\n                    f.write(out)\n                COUNT += 1\n\n    nPage = nextPage(mOut,False)\n```\nThe directory I'm writing to is as follows:\n```bash\n10:32@lorax:~/econ/estc/bin$ ll ../\ntotal 56\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 boincuser boincuser  4096 2011-07-31 14:29 ./\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 boincuser boincuser  4096 2011-07-31 14:20 ../\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 boincuser boincuser  4096 2011-08-09 10:38 bin/\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 boincuser boincuser    47 2011-07-31 14:21 results -> /media/cavalry/server_backup/econ/estc/results//\n-rw-r--r-- 1 boincuser boincuser 44759 2011-08-09 10:32 test.html\n```\nAnd I have confirmed there is enough space on the device:\n```bash\n10:38@lorax:~/econ/estc/bin$ df -h\nFilesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda1             9.0G  5.3G  3.3G  63% /\nnone                  495M  348K  495M   1% /dev\nnone                  500M  164K  500M   1% /dev/shm\nnone                  500M  340K  500M   1% /var/run\nnone                  500M     0  500M   0% /var/lock\nnone                  9.0G  5.3G  3.3G  63% /var/lib/ureadahead/debugfs\n/dev/sdc10            466G  223G  244G  48% /media/cavalry\n```\nI have tried changing the path of the write to the direct location instead of going through the link, rebooting the machine, and unmounting and re-mounting the drive, but none of these steps have resolved the issue. What could be the problem and how can I fix it?"

        "content": "The `IOError: [Errno 28] No space left on device` can be misleading because it might be caused by several factors other than actual storage space running out. Here are a few potential causes and solutions to consider:\n\n1. **Inode Exhaustion**: Even if you have enough disk space, you might have run out of inodes. Inodes are data structures used to keep information about files. You can check inode usage with the command `df -i`. If you're out of inodes, you'll need to reduce the number of files or directories on the filesystem.\n\n2. **Filesystem Limits**: Some filesystems have limits on the number of files or the size of a directory. Consider checking if your filesystem has such limits.\n\n3. **Permission Issues**: Ensure that the user running the script has write permissions to the destination directory.\n\n4. **File Descriptor Limit**: You might be hitting a limit on the number of open file descriptors. Although you are using a context manager (`with` statement) which should handle file closing automatically, ensuring that file descriptors are being closed properly by monitoring them with the `lsof` command could be useful.\n\n5. **Symlink Issues**: Since you're writing to a symlinked directory, ensure the symlink is correctly pointing to the intended directory and is not broken.\n\n6. **External Drive Issues**: Since the error occurs specifically when writing to an external drive, consider checking the health of the external drive for issues with `badblocks` or `smartctl`.\n\n7. **Temporary Disk Cache**: Sometimes, the disk caching mechanism can lead to unexpected issues. Try flushing the cache with `sync` or remounting the filesystem with `sync` option.\n\n8. **Corrupt Filesystem**: If there's filesystem corruption, even if the drive appears to have space, it might not be usable. Running `fsck` on the drive could help in diagnosing and fixing any issues.\n\n9. **Check Mount Options**: Make sure the external drive is mounted with the correct options to allow writing.\n\n10. **Logs and System Messages**: Check system logs (`/var/log/syslog` or `dmesg`) for any additional error messages related to disk operations.\n\n11. **Try a Different File System**: If possible, try writing to a different filesystem or partition to see if the issue persists.\n\nBy systematically checking these possibilities, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue."
