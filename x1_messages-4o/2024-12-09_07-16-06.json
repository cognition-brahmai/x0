        "content": "The issue with your current approach using `glob.glob('*')` is that it counts all files and directories in the specified path. To count only the files and exclude directories, you can use Python's `os` module to filter out directories. Here's an example of how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef count_files_in_directory(directory_path):\n    # List all entries in the specified directory\n    entries = os.listdir(directory_path)\n    \n    # Filter out directories, keeping only files\n    files = [entry for entry in entries if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(directory_path, entry))]\n    \n    # Return the count of files\n    return len(files)\n\n# Example usage\ndirectory_path = '.'  # Specify your directory path\nfile_count = count_files_in_directory(directory_path)\nprint(f\"Number of files in the directory: {file_count}\")\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `os.listdir(directory_path)` lists all entries (files and directories) in the specified directory.\n- `os.path.isfile(os.path.join(directory_path, entry))` checks if a particular entry is a file.\n- We use a list comprehension to filter out only the files and then count them using `len(files)`. \n\nThis approach ensures that only files are counted, excluding any directories."
