To achieve this, the program should be able to analyze the original lyric's word frequency and replace specific words with their corresponding alternative words listed in a table. Can you expand the program's functionality to identify and replace phrases, idioms, or even whole sentences with alternative variations?"

        "content": "Creating a dynamic JavaScript program to modify song lyrics by adding metaphors and eliminating repetitive patterns involves several steps. Below, I'll outline a basic structure for such a program, which can be expanded and refined based on specific requirements.\n\n### Step 1: Setup Data Structures\n\nFirst, we need to set up data structures to store the original lyrics, a word frequency map, and a table of alternative words, phrases, and metaphors.\n\n```javascript\nconst originalLyrics = `\n  Your original song lyrics go here. It should be a string with line breaks.\n`;\n\nconst alternatives = {\n  // Word alternatives\n  words: {\n    \"love\": [\"affection\", \"devotion\", \"fondness\"],\n    \"heart\": [\"soul\", \"core\", \"spirit\"],\n  },\n  // Phrase alternatives\n  phrases: {\n    \"break my heart\": [\"shatter my soul\", \"crush my spirit\"],\n    \"fall in love\": [\"descend into affection\", \"tumble into devotion\"],\n  },\n  // Sentence alternatives\n  sentences: {\n    \"I will always love you\": \"My affection for you is eternal\",\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Word Frequency\n\nWe need a function to analyze the frequency of words in the original lyrics.\n\n```javascript\nfunction analyzeFrequency(lyrics) {\n  const wordFrequency = {};\n  const words = lyrics.toLowerCase().match(/\\b\\w+\\b/g);\n\n  words.forEach(word => {\n    wordFrequency[word] = (wordFrequency[word] || 0) + 1;\n  });\n\n  return wordFrequency;\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Replace Words, Phrases, and Sentences\n\nCreate functions to replace words, phrases, and sentences with alternatives.\n\n```javascript\nfunction replaceWords(lyrics, alternatives) {\n  const words = lyrics.split(/\\b/);\n\n  const replacedWords = words.map(word => {\n    const lowerWord = word.toLowerCase();\n    if (alternatives.words[lowerWord]) {\n      const choices = alternatives.words[lowerWord];\n      return choices[Math.floor(Math.random() * choices.length)];\n    }\n    return word;\n  });\n\n  return replacedWords.join('');\n}\n\nfunction replacePhrases(lyrics, alternatives) {\n  for (const phrase in alternatives.phrases) {\n    const regex = new RegExp(`\\\\b${phrase}\\\\b`, 'gi');\n    const choices = alternatives.phrases[phrase];\n    lyrics = lyrics.replace(regex, () => choices[Math.floor(Math.random() * choices.length)]);\n  }\n  return lyrics;\n}\n\nfunction replaceSentences(lyrics, alternatives) {\n  for (const sentence in alternatives.sentences) {\n    const regex = new RegExp(sentence, 'gi');\n    lyrics = lyrics.replace(regex, alternatives.sentences[sentence]);\n  }\n  return lyrics;\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Execute the Modifications\n\nCombine all the steps to process the original lyrics.\n\n```javascript\nfunction modifyLyrics(originalLyrics, alternatives) {\n  let modifiedLyrics = originalLyrics;\n\n  // Optionally analyze frequency\n  const frequency = analyzeFrequency(modifiedLyrics);\n  console.log(\"Word Frequency:\", frequency);\n\n  // Replace sentences\n  modifiedLyrics = replaceSentences(modifiedLyrics, alternatives);\n\n  // Replace phrases\n  modifiedLyrics = replacePhrases(modifiedLyrics, alternatives);\n\n  // Replace words\n  modifiedLyrics = replaceWords(modifiedLyrics, alternatives);\n\n  return modifiedLyrics;\n}\n\nconst modifiedLyrics = modifyLyrics(originalLyrics, alternatives);\nconsole.log(\"Original Lyrics:\\n\", originalLyrics);\nconsole.log(\"Modified Lyrics:\\n\", modifiedLyrics);\n```\n\n### Step 5: Testing and Expansion\n\nYou can test the program with an example set of lyrics and alternatives. This is a basic implementation, and there are many ways to expand it. For instance:\n\n- **User Input**: Allow users to input their own lyrics and alternatives.\n- **GUI**: Create a simple web interface for users to interact with the program.\n- **Advanced NLP**: Integrate Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries for more sophisticated text analysis and transformation.\n- **Context Awareness**: Make replacements context-sensitive to maintain lyrical coherence.\n\nThis script provides a foundation, and you can build upon it to make it more robust and feature-rich."
