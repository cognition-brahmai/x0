However, when I try to call this method within the same object context, I am encountering an `AttributeError` that states my 'myThread' object has no attribute 'sample'. Why am I receiving this error? Here is the code for my class:\n\n```python\nclass myThread (threading.Thread):\n    def __init__(self, threadID, name, counter, redisOpsObj):\n        threading.Thread.__init__(self)\n        self.threadID = threadID\n        self.name = name\n        self.counter = counter\n        self.redisOpsObj = redisOpsObj\n        \n    def stop(self):\n        self.kill_received = True\n            \n    def sample(self):\n        print \"Hello\"\n                \n    def run(self):\n        time.sleep(0.1)\n        print \"\\n Starting \" + self.name\n        self.sample()\n```\n\nAnd this is how I am invoking it:\n\n```python\narThreads = []\nmaxThreads = 2;\n\nfor i in range( maxThreads ):\n    redisOpsObj = redisOps()\n    arThreads.append( myThread(i, \"Thread-\"+str(i), 10, redisOpsObj) )\n```\n\nThis is the stack trace displayed when I run the program:\n\n```python\nStarting Thread-0\n\nStarting Thread-1\nException in thread Thread-0:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.6/threading.py\", line 525, in __bootstrap_inner\nself.run()\nFile \"./redisQueueProcessor.py\", line 51, in run\nself.sample()\nAttributeError: 'myThread' object has no attribute 'sample'\n\nException in thread Thread-1:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.6/threading.py\", line 525, in __bootstrap_inner\nself.run()\nFile \"./redisQueueProcessor.py\", line 51, in run\nself.sample()\nAttributeError: 'myThread' object has no attribute 'sample'\n```\n\nI can assure that the `redisOps` class works fine, so the problem should not be related to it."

        "content": "The `AttributeError` you're encountering, which states that the `'myThread' object has no attribute 'sample'`, is unusual given that your code appears to define the `sample` method within the `myThread` class. However, there are a few potential reasons why this error could occur:\n\n1. **Indentation/Scope Issues**: Ensure that the `sample` method is correctly defined within the scope of the `myThread` class. Although it seems correct from the provided snippet, double-check to ensure there are no hidden indentation issues or misalignments.\n\n2. **File and Class Name Conflicts**: Make sure that there are no other files or modules named `myThread` or similarly named classes that might be causing a conflict. If there's another class or module with the same name being imported or defined elsewhere in your code, it could overshadow the correct class definition.\n\n3. **Dynamic Code Modifications**: Check if there are any parts of your code where attributes of the `myThread` class are being modified or dynamically altered, potentially removing or replacing methods.\n\n4. **Environment Issues**: Ensure that the Python environment where you are running the script is up to date and matches the version in which you expect the code to run. Sometimes, discrepancies in environments can lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n5. **Code Caching**: If you are using an IDE or environment that caches code, try clearing the cache or restarting the environment to ensure it's using the latest version of your script.\n\n6. **Print Debugging**: Add print statements before calling `self.sample()` to confirm that the `run` method is being executed as expected and that the object is indeed an instance of `myThread`.\n\nGiven these considerations, if none of the above solutions resolve the issue, please double-check any other parts of the script or environment setup that might not be visible in the provided code snippet. If possible, try running a minimal version of the code in a different environment to isolate the problem."
