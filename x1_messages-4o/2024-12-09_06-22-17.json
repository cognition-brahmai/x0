        "content": "In Python, warnings are handled differently than exceptions. While exceptions can be caught using the `try-except` block, warnings require a different approach. The `warnings` module in Python provides a way to handle warnings, and you can use it to filter, ignore, or capture warnings.\n\nTo handle warnings similarly to exceptions, you can use the `catch_warnings` context manager from the `warnings` module. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport warnings\n\n# Example function that produces a warning\ndef function_with_warning():\n    warnings.warn(\"This is a warning!\", UserWarning)\n\n# Using catch_warnings to handle warnings\nwith warnings.catch_warnings(record=True) as w:\n    # All warnings in this block will be captured\n    warnings.simplefilter(\"always\")  # Always trigger a warning\n\n    # Call the function that produces a warning\n    function_with_warning()\n\n    # Check if any warnings were captured\n    if w:\n        # Access the first warning\n        warning = w[0]\n        print(f\"Warning captured: {warning.message}\")\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n1. We import the `warnings` module.\n2. We define a function `function_with_warning()` that generates a warning using `warnings.warn()`.\n3. We use `warnings.catch_warnings(record=True)` to capture warnings. Setting `record=True` stores the warnings in a list.\n4. Inside the `with` block, we use `warnings.simplefilter(\"always\")` to ensure that all warnings are captured, regardless of their default behavior.\n5. We call the function that generates a warning.\n6. After the function call, we check if any warnings were captured by examining the list `w`.\n7. If warnings are present, we can access and handle them as needed.\n\nThis approach allows you to handle warnings in a way that is conceptually similar to handling exceptions with `try-except`."
