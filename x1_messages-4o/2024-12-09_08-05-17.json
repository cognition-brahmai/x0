        "content": "I am trying to test the call order of three functions in a module called 'module.py'. The functions are labeled 'a', 'b', and 'c'. I want to check that 'b' is called after 'a' and before 'c'. I am able to mock each of the functions individually, but I am struggling to check the order of the calls relative to one another. I've attempted to use 'call_args_list', but it doesn't seem to work as it's maintained separately for each mock. I've also tried to log each of the calls using a side effect, but this only gives me the args that the mocks were called with, not the actual mock that the call was made against. I've added more logic to the code to get it to work, but I'm wondering if there is a more efficient way to accomplish this within the API that I'm missing. Can you help me find a better solution?"

        "content": "To effectively test the call order of functions `a`, `b`, and `c` within your module, you can use Python's `unittest.mock` library, particularly leveraging `unittest.mock.Mock` and `unittest.mock.call`. Here's a streamlined approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Mock the Functions:** Mock the functions `a`, `b`, and `c` in your module.\n\n2. **Use `Mock` for Call Tracking:** Instead of mocking each function separately, create a single `Mock` object to track the calls in sequence.\n\n3. **Verify Call Order:** Use the `assert_has_calls` method with `unittest.mock.call` to verify the order of calls.\n\nHere is an example of how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom unittest.mock import patch, call\n\n# Assuming your module is named 'module.py'\nwith patch('module.a') as mock_a, patch('module.b') as mock_b, patch('module.c') as mock_c:\n\n    # Call your functions in the desired order\n    # For example, module.a(), module.b(), module.c()\n    module.a()\n    module.b()\n    module.c()\n\n    # Create a list of expected calls\n    expected_calls = [call(), call(), call()]\n\n    # Assert the order of calls\n    mock_a.assert_has_calls([expected_calls[0]])\n    mock_b.assert_has_calls([expected_calls[1]])\n    mock_c.assert_has_calls([expected_calls[2]])\n\n    # Alternatively, use a Mock object to track calls\n    mock_sequence = patch('module.a', new_callable=mock_a).start()\n    mock_sequence.attach_mock(mock_b, 'b')\n    mock_sequence.attach_mock(mock_c, 'c')\n\n    # Check the call order\n    mock_sequence.assert_has_calls([call(), call.b(), call.c()])\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Mocking Functions:** The `patch` function from `unittest.mock` is used to temporarily replace the real functions `a`, `b`, and `c` with mock objects during the test.\n\n- **Tracking Calls:** The `attach_mock` method is used to track the calls to the different mock objects (`mock_a`, `mock_b`, `mock_c`) within a single `Mock` object (`mock_sequence`).\n\n- **Verifying Order:** The `assert_has_calls` method is used to assert that the functions were called in the specified order. The `call()` object represents a call to a mock.\n\nThis approach ensures that you can verify the order of calls across multiple mocked functions within the same test case."
