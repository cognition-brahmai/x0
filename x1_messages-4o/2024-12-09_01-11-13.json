        "content": "I'm looking for a free, preferably open source, Python 3 IDE for teaching in our introductory programming classes to kids aged between 12-18. The preferred IDE should support Python 3 and meet the following criteria in order of necessity: it should be cross platform, offering standard features like syntax highlighting and auto-indent, have a run button, context-sensitive help (for instance, when they hover over math.floor() it should provide help for the function), an embedded Python shell, a built-in debugger, and it should be stripped off of unnecessary features, like refactoring tools and auto-completion, which may get in the way of teaching. Additionally, it should be lightweight as some kids will be using old PCs that are unable to run heavy IDEs like Eclipse. Can you recommend one?"
