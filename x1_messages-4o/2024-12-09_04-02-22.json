I followed all the steps and ran the server using this command: './manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000'. However, when I tried to visit the IP at port 8000, I am encountering the following error: 'DisallowedHost at / Invalid HTTP_HOST header: 'XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:8000'. You may need to add u'XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX' to ALLOWED_HOSTS'. Why am I receiving this error and how can I resolve it?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to Django's security feature that prevents HTTP Host header attacks. By default, Django doesn't allow any hostnames except those you explicitly specify in the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting in your Django project's settings file.\n\nHere's how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Locate the settings file:**\n   - Open your Django project's settings file, which is usually located at `your_project/settings.py`.\n\n2. **Modify the `ALLOWED_HOSTS`:**\n   - Find the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` list in the settings file. It usually looks like this:\n     ```python\n     ALLOWED_HOSTS = []\n     ```\n   - Add the IP address (or domain name) you're using to access the server to this list. For example, if your IP address is `XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX`, modify the line as follows:\n     ```python\n     ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX']\n     ```\n   - If you want to allow all hostnames (not recommended for production), you can set:\n     ```python\n     ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']\n     ```\n     However, be cautious with this setting as it opens up your application to potential security risks.\n\n3. **Restart the Django server:**\n   - After making these changes, save the file and restart your Django server to apply the changes:\n     ```bash\n     ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `DisallowedHost` error and access your Django application through the specified IP address."
