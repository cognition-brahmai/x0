Currently, it's written as follows:\n\n```python\n__all__ = ['basemapper', 'lxml']\nfrom basemaper import *\nimport lxml\n```\n\nWhen should I use \"__all__\" in my Python package?"

        "content": "In Python packages, `__init__.py` files serve several purposes, including marking a directory as a package, managing the package namespace, and controlling what is imported when `import *` is used on a package. Let's break down how to properly write your `__init__.py` files based on your package structure and needs.\n\n### General Guidelines for `__init__.py` Files\n\n1. **Marking a Package**:\n   - Simply having an `__init__.py` file in a directory tells Python that this directory should be considered a package.\n\n2. **Managing Imports**:\n   - You can use `__init__.py` to manage the imports within your package. This is useful for defining what is accessible at the package level.\n\n3. **Using `__all__`**:\n   - The `__all__` list defines what symbols the module exports when `from module import *` is used. It should contain the names of the submodules or objects you want to be accessible when the package is imported.\n   - If `__all__` is not defined, then `import *` will import all names that do not start with an underscore (`_`).\n\n### Specific Instructions for Your `__init__.py` Files\n\n#### `__init__.py #1` (Package Level)\nThis file appears to be correctly managing the top-level package imports. When you write:\n\n```python\n__all__ = ['mapper', 'vehicle']\nimport mapper\nimport vehicle\n```\n\nYou're making sure that `mapper` and `vehicle` submodules are accessible when someone imports the `mobilescouter` package. So, it looks good.\n\n#### `__init__.py #2` (Mapper Subpackage)\nThe current implementation has a typo and a potential issue. Here's a corrected version:\n\n```python\n__all__ = ['basemapper', 'lxml']\nfrom .basemapper import *\nfrom . import lxml\n```\n\n- **Fixed Typo**: Ensure that \"basemaper\" is correctly spelled as \"basemapper\".\n- **Relative Imports**: Use relative imports (with a dot) to make it clear that `basemapper` and `lxml` are within the same package.\n\n### When to Use `__all__`\n\n- **Use `__all__`** when you want to control what is exported during a wildcard import (`from module import *`). It helps in maintaining a clear public API.\n- If you don't specify `__all__`, Python will export all symbols that do not start with an underscore.\n- It's a good practice to define `__all__` if your module or package includes internal helper functions or classes that you don't want to expose as part of the module's public API.\n\n### Example for Subpackages\n\nFor `lxml` and other subpackages or modules, you might want to define `__all__` like this if they have multiple imports or classes:\n\n```python\n# Example for lxml/__init__.py\n__all__ = ['vehiclemapper', 'vehiclefeaturemapper', 'vehiclefeaturesetmapper']\nfrom .vehiclemapper import VehicleMapper\nfrom .vehiclefeaturemapper import VehicleFeatureMapper\nfrom .vehiclefeaturesetmapper import VehicleFeatureSetMapper\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that only the specified classes or functions are available for import when the subpackage or module is imported, maintaining a clean and manageable namespace."
