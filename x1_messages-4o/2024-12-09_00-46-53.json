I've tried both build_modules.py and sphinx-apidoc, which successfully create rst docs in my output directory for the packages and top-level modules. However, when I build using \"make html\", it returns thousands of warnings of type: \"&lt;autosummary&gt;:None: WARNING: toctree contains reference to nonexisting document 'rstDocs/src.Example1.class1.method1'\" for every class and method in the codebase. I believe the autosummary/autoclass directives are creating toctrees that expect there to be rst files for every class and method. Despite the warnings, the documentation works well but I would like to eliminate these warnings. I suspect I may have misconfigured something. I've tried nipype/tools and even modified apigen.py and build_modref_templates.py to create rst stubs for each \"missing\" document, but the build process takes a long time and eventually crashes due to memory errors. Can anyone provide advice on how to resolve these warnings without modifying the sphinx site-package files?"

        "content": "It sounds like you're encountering a common issue when using Sphinx with large codebases. Here are some steps and tips that might help you resolve these warnings without modifying the Sphinx site-package files:\n\n1. **Check Your Sphinx Configuration**: Make sure your `conf.py` file is properly configured. Specifically, check the following settings:\n   - Ensure `extensions` includes `'sphinx.ext.autosummary'` and `'sphinx.ext.autodoc'`.\n   - Set `autosummary_generate = True` to enable automatic generation of summary files.\n   - If you're using `napoleon` for Google or NumPy style docstrings, ensure it is included in the `extensions`.\n\n2. **Autosummary with Templates**: Autosummary can generate stub `.rst` files for each class and method. Ensure that you have the following in your `conf.py` to make this happen:\n   ```python\n   autosummary_generate = True\n   ```\n\n3. **Manual Intervention with Autosummary**:\n   - Run `sphinx-autogen` manually on your `rst` files to generate the necessary summaries before running `make html`. This step can sometimes work more reliably than relying solely on the build process.\n   - Command example:\n     ```bash\n     sphinx-autogen -o output_directory source_directory/*.rst\n     ```\n\n4. **Optimize Memory Usage**:\n   - If memory usage is a problem, consider breaking your documentation build into smaller chunks or running it on a machine with more memory.\n   - Use tools like `mprof` to profile memory usage and identify bottlenecks.\n\n5. **Suppress Warnings**:\n   - If the documentation is generating correctly and you want to suppress warnings, you can adjust the `conf.py` to ignore specific warnings using the `suppress_warnings` option:\n     ```python\n     suppress_warnings = ['toc.excluded']\n     ```\n   - Be cautious with this approach, as it might hide other useful warnings.\n\n6. **Verify Toctree References**:\n   - Double-check your `.rst` files to ensure that the `:toctree:` directives are correctly pointing to existing documents. The paths should be relative to the directory containing the `index.rst`.\n\n7. **Clean Build**:\n   - Before running `make html`, ensure you have a clean build environment by deleting the `build` directory or using `make clean`.\n\n8. **Documentation Tools**:\n   - Consider using other tools or extensions that are known to handle large codebases better, such as `sphinx-autoapi`, which might provide better support for larger projects.\n\n9. **Community and Support**:\n   - Since this is a common issue, you might find additional tailored advice by searching or asking in communities like Stack Overflow or the Sphinx documentation mailing list.\n\nHopefully, one or a combination of these suggestions will help you eliminate the warnings and build your documentation more efficiently."
