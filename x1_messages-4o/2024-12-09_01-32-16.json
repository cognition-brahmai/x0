I want to find an efficient solution to determine the difference between two strings and then restore the second string from the first one and the difference. What would be an optimal way to do this?"

        "content": "To efficiently determine the difference between two strings and be able to reconstruct the second string from the first one and the difference, you can use a technique called \"diff and patch.\" In Python, the `difflib` module provides a convenient way to compute differences between sequences, including strings. The `SequenceMatcher` class can be particularly useful here.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solving your problem:\n\n1. **Calculate Differences:** Use `difflib.SequenceMatcher` to find the differences between the two strings.\n\n2. **Extract the Difference:** Use the `get_opcodes()` method to get a list of operations that can transform the first string into the second.\n\n3. **Reconstruct the String:** Apply the changes described by the operations to reconstruct the second string from the first one.\n\nHere's a sample implementation:\n\n```python\nimport difflib\n\ndef get_difference(str1, str2):\n    # Create a SequenceMatcher object\n    matcher = difflib.SequenceMatcher(None, str1, str2)\n    # Get the opcodes\n    opcodes = matcher.get_opcodes()\n    return opcodes\n\ndef apply_difference(str1, opcodes):\n    # Reconstruct str2 using str1 and opcodes\n    result = []\n    for tag, i1, i2, j1, j2 in opcodes:\n        if tag == 'equal':\n            result.append(str1[i1:i2])\n        elif tag == 'insert':\n            result.append(str2[j1:j2])\n        elif tag == 'replace':\n            result.append(str2[j1:j2])\n        # 'delete' operations need no action to be taken\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Example usage\nstr1 = 'afrykanerskoj\u0119zyczny'\nstr2 = 'afrykanerskoj\u0119zyczni'\n\n# Get difference\nopcodes = get_difference(str1, str2)\n\n# Reconstruct the second string\nreconstructed_str2 = apply_difference(str1, opcodes)\n\nprint(\"Original String:\", str1)\nprint(\"Target String:\", str2)\nprint(\"Reconstructed String:\", reconstructed_str2)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `get_difference` function calculates the differences between two strings using `difflib.SequenceMatcher` and returns a list of opcodes.\n- `apply_difference` function uses these opcodes to reconstruct the second string from the first one.\n\nThis method is efficient and leverages Python's built-in capabilities to handle string differences and transformations."
