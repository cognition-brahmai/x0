However, I've noticed that matplotlib is automatically adjusting the scale on the colormap based on the entries of the matrices. For instance, if one matrix has all entries as 10 and another has all entries as 5, using the 'Greys' colormap, one of my subplots should be completely black and the other should be completely grey. But, they both end up being completely black. How can I ensure that all the subplots share the same scale on the colormap?"

        "content": "To ensure that all your subplots share the same scale on the colormap in `matplotlib`, you need to set a common `vmin` and `vmax` for the colormap across all the subplots. This will prevent `matplotlib` from automatically adjusting the scale based on individual subplot data, and instead, it will use the same scale for all.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. Determine the minimum and maximum values across all your matrices. You can do this by inspecting your data beforehand or by using a simple calculation.\n\n2. Use these minimum and maximum values as the `vmin` and `vmax` parameters when calling `imshow`.\n\nHere's an example code snippet:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Example matrices\nmatrix1 = np.full((10, 10), 10)\nmatrix2 = np.full((10, 10), 5)\nmatrix3 = np.full((10, 10), 7)\nmatrix4 = np.full((10, 10), 3)\n\n# Calculate the common vmin and vmax\nvmin = min(matrix1.min(), matrix2.min(), matrix3.min(), matrix4.min())\nvmax = max(matrix1.max(), matrix2.max(), matrix3.max(), matrix4.max())\n\n# Create subplots\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2)\n\n# Plot each matrix with the same colormap scale\naxes[0, 0].imshow(matrix1, cmap='Greys', vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax)\naxes[0, 1].imshow(matrix2, cmap='Greys', vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax)\naxes[1, 0].imshow(matrix3, cmap='Greys', vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax)\naxes[1, 1].imshow(matrix4, cmap='Greys', vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax)\n\n# Adjust layout\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n# Display the plots\nplt.show()\n```\n\nBy setting `vmin` and `vmax`, you'll ensure that all subplots share the same colormap scale, and therefore, the color representation will be consistent across all your data."
