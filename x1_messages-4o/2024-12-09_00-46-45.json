Got 'multilabel-indicator' instead.\" However, the split works fine when I use a binary target variable. How can I resolve this issue? Here's the code that I'm currently using:\n\n```python\nnum_classes = len(np.unique(y_train))\ny_train_categorical = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes)\nkf=StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=999)\n\n# splitting data into different folds\nfor i, (train_index, val_index) in enumerate(kf.split(x_train, y_train_categorical)):\n    x_train_kf, x_val_kf = x_train[train_index], x_train[val_index]\n    y_train_kf, y_val_kf = y_train[train_index], y_train[val_index]\n\nValueError: Supported target types are: ('binary', 'multiclass'). Got 'multilabel-indicator' instead.\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering occurs because `StratifiedKFold` expects the target variable to be either binary or multiclass (i.e., a single column with integer labels), but you are passing a one-hot encoded version of your target variable, which is a multilabel-indicator format. \n\nTo resolve this issue, you should pass the original target variable `y_train` to the `kf.split` method, not the one-hot encoded version. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\nimport numpy as np\nimport keras\n\nnum_classes = len(np.unique(y_train))\nkf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=999)\n\n# splitting data into different folds\nfor i, (train_index, val_index) in enumerate(kf.split(x_train, y_train)):\n    x_train_kf, x_val_kf = x_train[train_index], x_train[val_index]\n    \n    # Use the original y_train for splitting\n    y_train_kf, y_val_kf = y_train[train_index], y_train[val_index]\n    \n    # Convert to categorical if needed for further processing\n    y_train_kf_categorical = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train_kf, num_classes)\n    y_val_kf_categorical = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_val_kf, num_classes)\n\n    # Now you can use x_train_kf, x_val_kf, y_train_kf_categorical, y_val_kf_categorical\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, the `kf.split()` method uses `y_train` directly for stratification, and then you can convert the split target variables to categorical format if needed for further processing in your model."
