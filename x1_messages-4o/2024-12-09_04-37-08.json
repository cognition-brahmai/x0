        "content": "Certainly! If you have a dictionary where each key represents a keyword and the associated value represents the number of times that keyword appears, you can easily find the number of distinct keywords. Since a dictionary inherently has unique keys, the number of distinct keywords is simply the number of keys in the dictionary. Here's how you can do that in Python:\n\n```python\n# Example dictionary\nkeyword_dict = {\n    'apple': 5,\n    'banana': 3,\n    'orange': 2,\n    'apple': 5,  # Note: duplicate keys are not allowed in dictionaries\n    'grape': 1\n}\n\n# Get the number of distinct keywords\ndistinct_keyword_count = len(keyword_dict)\n\nprint(\"Number of distinct keywords:\", distinct_keyword_count)\n```\n\nIn this example, `len(keyword_dict)` will give you the count of distinct keywords because dictionaries store keys uniquely.\n\nIf you're interested in actually getting the list of distinct keywords, you can simply retrieve the keys of the dictionary:\n\n```python\n# Get the list of distinct keywords\ndistinct_keywords = list(keyword_dict.keys())\n\nprint(\"Distinct keywords:\", distinct_keywords)\n```\n\nThis will give you a list of all the distinct keywords in the dictionary."
