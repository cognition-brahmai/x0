        "content": "When you're working within the IDLE interactive shell and you want to execute a Python script, you don't use the `python helloworld.py` command as you would in a terminal or command prompt. Instead, you can execute a script from within IDLE by using the `exec()` function or by importing the script as a module if it's in the same directory. Here are the steps you can follow:\n\n1. **Using `exec()`**:\n   First, you need to open your script file and read its contents. Then, you can use the `exec()` function to execute the script.\n\n   ```python\n   with open('helloworld.py') as file:\n       exec(file.read())\n   ```\n\n2. **Importing the Script**:\n   If your script is in the same directory as your IDLE session, you can import it as a module. Make sure your script is named `helloworld.py` and does not have any syntax errors.\n\n   ```python\n   import helloworld\n   ```\n\n   Note: If you modify the script and want to run it again, you'll need to reload the module using the `importlib` library:\n   \n   ```python\n   import importlib\n   import helloworld\n   importlib.reload(helloworld)\n   ```\n\nThese methods should allow you to run your Python script from within the IDLE interactive shell."
