Python 2.7 is the default version and Python 3.5 has already been installed via brew and is working well. However, I am unsure of how to install the remaining versions. I intend to run the tests using `tox` and it needs to be able to locate them. It appears that brew is not willing to install 3.4 since 3.5 has been added and I do not want to remove the 3.5 version. How can I successfully install these versions and get `tox` to find them?"

        "content": "To manage multiple versions of Python on macOS, you can use `pyenv`, a popular tool for handling different Python installations. Here's how you can set it up and use it to manage the Python versions you need:\n\n### Step 1: Install pyenv\n\nFirst, install `pyenv` using Homebrew:\n\n```bash\nbrew update\nbrew install pyenv\n```\n\nOnce installed, add the following lines to your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc` to initialize `pyenv` automatically:\n\n```bash\nexport PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"\nexport PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"\neval \"$(pyenv init --path)\"\neval \"$(pyenv init --)\"\n```\n\nThen, reload your shell configuration:\n\n```bash\nsource ~/.bash_profile  # or source ~/.zshrc\n```\n\n### Step 2: Install Required Python Versions\n\nYou can now install the specific Python versions you need:\n\n```bash\npyenv install 2.6.9\npyenv install 2.7.18\npyenv install 3.4.10\npyenv install 3.5.10\n```\n\nCheck the available versions with `pyenv install --list` if you need to verify the exact versions.\n\n### Step 3: Set Global or Local Python Versions\n\nYou can set a global default Python version that will be used system-wide:\n\n```bash\npyenv global 2.7.18\n```\n\nOr, set a local version for a specific project directory:\n\n```bash\ncd your_project_directory\npyenv local 3.5.10\n```\n\n### Step 4: Verify Installation\n\nEnsure that the versions are installed correctly:\n\n```bash\npyenv versions\n```\n\n### Step 5: Integrate with Tox\n\n`tox` can be configured to use specific environments. Create a `tox.ini` file in your project directory and define the environments:\n\n```ini\n[tox]\nenvlist = py26, py27, py34, py35\n\n[testenv]\ndeps = <dependencies for tests>\ncommands = <commands to run tests>\n\n[testenv:py26]\nbasepython = ~/.pyenv/versions/2.6.9/bin/python\n\n[testenv:py27]\nbasepython = ~/.pyenv/versions/2.7.18/bin/python\n\n[testenv:py34]\nbasepython = ~/.pyenv/versions/3.4.10/bin/python\n\n[testenv:py35]\nbasepython = ~/.pyenv/versions/3.5.10/bin/python\n```\n\n### Step 6: Use Conda for Python 3.5\n\nIf you need to use Conda's Python 3.5, you can create a Conda environment:\n\n```bash\nconda create -n py35 python=3.5\n```\n\nActivate the environment:\n\n```bash\nconda activate py35\n```\n\nFor `tox`, you can add another environment in `tox.ini`:\n\n```ini\n[testenv:conda35]\nbasepython = <path to conda environment's python>\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy using `pyenv` and configuring `tox` with the paths to the specific Python binaries, you can easily manage and run tests across different Python versions without conflicts. This setup allows you to maintain multiple versions of Python and streamline your development workflow."
