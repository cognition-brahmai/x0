For instance, in MATLAB, if I create a matrix of zeros with dimensions 2 and 5 and then input size(a), it outputs the dimensions '2 5'. However, I'm not sure how to achieve this in Python. Here's some sample MATLAB code for reference:\n\n```MATLAB\n>>> a = zeros(2,5)\n 0 0 0 0 0\n 0 0 0 0 0\n>>> size(a)\n 2 5\n```\n\nFor Python, I've started by creating an array of zeros with dimensions 2 and 5:\n\n```python\n>>> a = zeros((2,5))\n>>> \narray([[ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n       [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.]])\n```\n\nHow do I determine the size of this array?"

        "content": "In Python, using the NumPy library, you can determine the size (or dimensions) of an array using the `.shape` attribute. This is similar to MATLAB's `size()` function. Here's how you can do it for your example:\n\nFirst, ensure you have imported NumPy:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n```\n\nThen, create the array and get its shape:\n\n```python\na = np.zeros((2, 5))\nprint(a.shape)\n```\n\nThe `a.shape` attribute will return a tuple representing the dimensions of the array. In your case, it will output:\n\n```\n(2, 5)\n```\n\nThis indicates that the array `a` has 2 rows and 5 columns, similar to what MATLAB's `size(a)` would return."
