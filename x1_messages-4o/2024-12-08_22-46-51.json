Here are two ways to achieve that:\n\n1. **Convert negative numbers to zero:**\n\n   ```python\n   array = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]\n   modified_array = [x if x >= 0 else 0 for x in array]\n   print(modified_array)\n   ```\n\n   This will give you: `[0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3]`\n\n2. **Take the absolute value of each element:**\n\n   ```python\n   array = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]\n   modified_array = [abs(x) for x in array]\n   print(modified_array)\n   ```\n\n   This will give you: `[2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3]`\n\nYou can choose the method that best fits your needs."
