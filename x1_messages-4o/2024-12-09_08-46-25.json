Triple quotes allow you to include both types of quotation marks without needing to escape them. You can use either triple single quotes (`'''`) or triple double quotes (`\"\"\"`). Here's how you can do it:\n\nUsing triple single quotes:\n\n```python\nmy_string = '''This is a string with both single (') and double (\") quotes.'''\nprint(my_string)\n```\n\nUsing triple double quotes:\n\n```python\nmy_string = \"\"\"This is a string with both single (') and double (\") quotes.\"\"\"\nprint(my_string)\n```\n\nBoth of these methods will allow you to include both single and double quotes in your string without needing to escape them."
