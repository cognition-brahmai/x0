It was in a real \\textbf{single} \\textbf{prickle} of a \\textbf{numb} situation, feeling \\textbf{alive} but \\textbf{dead} inside, and needed a good \\textbf{thrill} to \\textbf{soothe} the \\textbf{bells} in its \\textbf{soul}.\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Homophones**: Ting, Single, Soul\n- **Synonyms**: Prickle, Thrill\n- **Antonyms**: Numb, Soothe\n\n### Table: Usage Frequency of \"Tingle\" in English Literature\n\n| Century      | Usage Frequency (Estimated Instances per 1 Million Words) |\n|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| 19th Century | 2                                                        |\n| 20th Century | 5                                                        |\n| 21st Century | 8                                                        |\n\nNote: This table is a conceptual representation based on general trends in literature and might not be precise without access to a comprehensive linguistic database.\n\n### SQL Query\n\nTo retrieve instances of the word \"tingle\" in the works of William Shakespeare, assuming you have a database with a table named `shakespeare_works` that contains columns `work_title` and `text`, the SQL query would look like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT work_title, \n       text \nFROM shakespeare_works \nWHERE text LIKE '%tingle%';\n```\n\nThis query would return all occurrences of the word \"tingle\" in the texts of Shakespeare's works, along with the title of the work in which it appears.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!"
