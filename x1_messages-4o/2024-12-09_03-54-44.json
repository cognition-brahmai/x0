I've tried to force reinstall Sphinx with `pip --force-reinstall sphinx`, but it doesn't seem to fix the issue. Are there any dependencies I need to install?

        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to locale settings on your system. The `locale` module in Python is trying to determine your system's default locale, but it\u2019s encountering an unknown or improperly configured locale. This is a common issue on macOS systems when the system locale is set to a value that Python doesn't recognize, such as `UTF-8` without a language code.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check and Set Locale Environment Variables:**\n\n   You can temporarily set the locale environment variables in your terminal session to a known value. Add these lines to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`) or run them directly in the terminal:\n\n   ```sh\n   export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8\n   export LANG=en_US.UTF-8\n   ```\n\n   After setting these variables, restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bash_profile` (or the equivalent for your shell).\n\n2. **Check Current Locale Settings:**\n\n   You can check your current locale settings by running:\n\n   ```sh\n   locale\n   ```\n\n   Ensure that the output reflects valid locale settings. If any of the variables show as `UTF-8` without a language code, that\u2019s likely the source of the problem.\n\n3. **Reinstall Locale Data:**\n\n   If the above steps do not work, you might need to reinstall locale data on your system. This is less common on macOS but can be necessary on other systems.\n\n4. **Update Python and Sphinx:**\n\n   Consider upgrading your Python environment and Sphinx version if possible. Sphinx 1.1.3 is quite old, and many improvements have been made in newer versions. You can update Sphinx with:\n\n   ```sh\n   pip install --upgrade sphinx\n   ```\n\n   If you are using a Python version manager like `pyenv`, you might want to consider upgrading to a newer version of Python as well.\n\n5. **Virtual Environment:**\n\n   It might be beneficial to use a Python virtual environment to avoid conflicts with system-installed packages. You can create a virtual environment and install Sphinx there:\n\n   ```sh\n   python -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n   pip install sphinx\n   sphinx-quickstart\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the locale issue and successfully run `sphinx-quickstart`."
