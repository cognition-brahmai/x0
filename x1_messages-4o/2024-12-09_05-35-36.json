The data set is difficult and I have balanced my training set per subject and per class label. Here is my simple CNN architecture with real-time data augmentation:\n\n```python\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(Convolution2D(32, 3, 3, border_mode=borderMode, init=initialization,  input_shape=(48, 48, 3)))\nmodel.add(BatchNormalization())\nmodel.add(PReLU())\nmodel.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))\n\nmodel.add(Flatten())\nmodel.add(Dense(256))\nmodel.add(BatchNormalization())\nmodel.add(PReLU())\nmodel.add(Dropout(0.5))\n\nmodel.add(Dense(nb_output))\nmodel.add(Activation('softmax'))\n```\n\nAfter the first epoch, my training loss is decreasing constantly while my validation loss is increasing. Could overfitting occur this early? Or could there be a problem with my data being confusing? Should I balance my testing set as well?"

        "content": "From the description of your issue, it seems like you are experiencing overfitting early in the training process. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, and fails to generalize to unseen data (the validation set in your case).\n\nHere are several steps you can take to address this issue:\n\n1. **Data Augmentation**: You mentioned using real-time data augmentation, which is great. Ensure that you are using a variety of augmentation techniques like rotation, zoom, horizontal flipping, and brightness adjustments to make your model more robust.\n\n2. **Regularization Techniques**:\n    - **Dropout**: You are already using dropout in your fully connected layer. Consider adding dropout to other parts of your network as well.\n    - **L2 Regularization**: Add L2 regularization to your convolutional and dense layers to penalize large weights.\n\n3. **Model Complexity**: Your model might be too complex for the task, leading to overfitting. Consider reducing the number of parameters by:\n    - Decreasing the number of filters in your convolutional layers.\n    - Reducing the number of units in the dense layer.\n\n4. **Early Stopping**: Implement early stopping based on validation loss to prevent the model from training too long and overfitting.\n\n5. **Learning Rate**: Experiment with different learning rates. Sometimes, a high learning rate can cause the model to converge to suboptimal solutions.\n\n6. **Balanced Testing Set**: While balancing the testing set is not as crucial as balancing the training set, it can help provide a more accurate evaluation of your model's performance. If the testing set is highly imbalanced, it might skew the evaluation metrics.\n\n7. **Re-evaluate Data**: Ensure your data preprocessing steps are correctly applied. Sometimes, issues in data can lead to confusing patterns the model struggles to learn.\n\n8. **Architecture Adjustments**: Consider adding more convolutional layers with pooling in between to allow the model to learn more complex features before flattening and moving to fully connected layers.\n\n9. **Batch Size and Epochs**: Experiment with different batch sizes and a number of epochs. Sometimes, a smaller batch size can help the model generalize better.\n\n10. **Visualize Training**: Plot training and validation curves for both accuracy and loss to get more insights into the model's performance over epochs.\n\nBy applying some of these strategies, you should be able to mitigate the early overfitting issue and improve the generalization of your model."
