Additionally, since Python 3.2, you can use the `exist_ok=True` argument with `os.makedirs` to prevent an error if the directory already exists. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nfilename = \"/foo/bar/baz.txt\"\n\n# Ensure the directory exists\ndirectory = os.path.dirname(filename)\nos.makedirs(directory, exist_ok=True)\n\n# Now write to the file\nwith open(filename, \"w\") as f:\n    f.write(\"FOOBAR\")\n```\n\nThis will create the `/foo/bar` directories if they don't already exist, and then it will create and write to `/foo/bar/baz.txt`. This approach is efficient, concise, and handles the directory creation process in a Pythonic manner."
