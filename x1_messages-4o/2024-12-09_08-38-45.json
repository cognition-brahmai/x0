        "content": "To compare two lists of lists in Python and output the differences, you can utilize sets for efficient comparison. However, since you are working with lists of lists, you'll need to convert each inner list to a tuple because lists are not hashable and cannot be directly used within sets. Here's how you can achieve the desired output:\n\n```python\n# Your input lists\nFirst_list = [['Test.doc', '1a1a1a', 1111], \n              ['Test2.doc', '2b2b2b', 2222],  \n              ['Test3.doc', '3c3c3c', 3333]]  \n\nSecnd_list = [['Test.doc', '1a1a1a', 1111], \n              ['Test2.doc', '2b2b2b', 2222], \n              ['Test3.doc', '8p8p8p', 9999], \n              ['Test4.doc', '4d4d4d', 4444]]\n\n# Convert lists of lists to sets of tuples\nfirst_set = set(map(tuple, First_list))\nsecond_set = set(map(tuple, Secnd_list))\n\n# Find differences\ndifferences = first_set.symmetric_difference(second_set)\n\n# Convert the result back to a list of lists\nDifferences = [list(item) for item in differences]\n\n# Sort the differences for a consistent order (optional, for clarity)\nDifferences.sort()\n\n# Output the differences\nprint(Differences)\n```\n\nThis script will output the differences between the two lists as expected:\n\n```python\n[['Test3.doc', '3c3c3c', 3333], ['Test3.doc', '8p8p8p', 9999], ['Test4.doc', '4d4d4d', 4444]]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Conversion to Tuples**: The lists within the main lists are converted to tuples so that they can be added to sets since tuples are hashable.\n\n2. **Symmetric Difference**: The `symmetric_difference` of the two sets is computed. This operation finds elements that are in either of the sets but not in both.\n\n3. **Conversion Back to Lists**: The result is converted back to a list of lists for the desired output format.\n\n4. **Sorting (Optional)**: The result is sorted to ensure consistent order when printed or compared, although this is not necessary for the logic itself."
