However, every time I execute the following string as a query, I get a ValueError indicating an unsupported format character ''' (0x27) at index 1. The problematic string is:\n\n```python\n\"SELECT fileid FROM files WHERE description LIKE '%\" + search + \"%' OR filename LIKE '%\" + search + \"%' OR uploader LIKE '%\" + search + \"%' ORDER BY fileid DESC\"\n```\n\nIf I remove the character it asks for, then I also have to remove the %, which stops the query from working properly. How can I fix this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely due to the way the query string is being constructed, which can introduce syntax errors or vulnerabilities like SQL injection. To resolve the error and ensure your query is safe and well-formed, it's best to use parameterized queries.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use parameterized queries with MySQL in Python using a library like `mysql-connector-python`:\n\n1. **Install the MySQL Connector:** If you haven't already, you can install it using pip.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install mysql-connector-python\n   ```\n\n2. **Use Parameterized Queries:** This approach helps avoid syntax errors and protects against SQL injection attacks.\n\n```python\nimport mysql.connector\n\n# Connect to your MySQL database\nconn = mysql.connector.connect(\n    host='your_host',\n    user='your_user',\n    password='your_password',\n    database='your_database'\n)\n\n# Create a cursor object\ncursor = conn.cursor()\n\n# Your search term\nsearch = \"your_search_term\"\n\n# Parameterized query\nquery = \"\"\"\n    SELECT fileid FROM files \n    WHERE description LIKE %s OR filename LIKE %s OR uploader LIKE %s \n    ORDER BY fileid DESC\n\"\"\"\n\n# The parameter tuple should contain the search term formatted with wildcards\nparameters = ('%' + search + '%', '%' + search + '%', '%' + search + '%')\n\n# Execute the query with parameters\ncursor.execute(query, parameters)\n\n# Fetch the results\nresults = cursor.fetchall()\n\n# Process the results\nfor row in results:\n    print(row)\n\n# Close the cursor and connection\ncursor.close()\nconn.close()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Parameterized Queries:** Using `%s` as placeholders in your SQL query and providing the actual values as a tuple in the `execute()` method protects against SQL injection and ensures proper syntax.\n- **Connections and Cursors:** Always close your cursor and connection once you're done to free up resources.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error and safely execute your SQL query."
