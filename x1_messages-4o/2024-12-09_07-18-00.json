        "content": "Yes, you can retrieve a list of all the routes that have been declared in your Flask application. Flask provides an attribute called `url_map` on the `app` object, which contains all the routes (or rules) defined in the application. You can iterate over this map to get a list of all the routes. Here's a simple way to do it:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n# Example route definitions\n@app.route('/')\ndef home():\n    return \"Welcome to the home page!\"\n\n@app.route('/about')\ndef about():\n    return \"This is the about page.\"\n\n@app.route('/contact')\ndef contact():\n    return \"Contact us here.\"\n\n# Function to list all routes\ndef list_routes(app):\n    routes = []\n    for rule in app.url_map.iter_rules():\n        routes.append((rule.endpoint, rule.rule))\n    return routes\n\n# Print all routes\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    with app.app_context():\n        for endpoint, route in list_routes(app):\n            print(f\"Endpoint: {endpoint}, Route: {route}\")\n```\n\nIn this script:\n\n- We define a function `list_routes` that iterates over `app.url_map.iter_rules()`.\n- Each rule in `url_map` consists of an endpoint and a URL rule. You can extract these to get a list of all routes.\n- The example prints all the endpoints and their corresponding routes.\n\nMake sure this code is run in a context where the `app` is fully initialized (like within an `app_context`), especially if you're using application factories or blueprints. This will ensure all routes are registered before you attempt to list them."
