The known code I have seen for getting properties from CUDA devices is by enumerating over all devices and retrieving properties from them. However, I need a solution where I want to get properties from a device that is already chosen or active, instead of all devices present in the system. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To get the properties of the currently active CUDA device, you can use the CUDA Runtime API. The process involves querying the device that is currently set as active in the context of your program. Here's a step-by-step guide and a code example in C++:\n\n1. **Include the necessary headers:**\n   Make sure to include the CUDA Runtime header.\n\n   ```cpp\n   #include <cuda_runtime.h>\n   ```\n\n2. **Query the active device:**\n   Use `cudaGetDevice` to get the device ID of the currently active CUDA device.\n\n3. **Retrieve device properties:**\n   Use `cudaGetDeviceProperties` to get the properties of the active device.\n\nHere's a simple code example demonstrating these steps:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int device;\n    cudaError_t err;\n\n    // Get the currently active device\n    err = cudaGetDevice(&device);\n    if (err != cudaSuccess) {\n        std::cerr << \"Failed to get the current device: \" << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    // Get properties of the active device\n    cudaDeviceProp deviceProp;\n    err = cudaGetDeviceProperties(&deviceProp, device);\n    if (err != cudaSuccess) {\n        std::cerr << \"Failed to get device properties: \" << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    // Display some of the device properties\n    std::cout << \"Device \" << device << \": \" << deviceProp.name << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"  Total Global Memory: \" << deviceProp.totalGlobalMem << \" bytes\" << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"  Shared Memory per Block: \" << deviceProp.sharedMemPerBlock << \" bytes\" << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"  Registers per Block: \" << deviceProp.regsPerBlock << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"  Warp Size: \" << deviceProp.warpSize << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"  Max Threads per Block: \" << deviceProp.maxThreadsPerBlock << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `cudaGetDevice` retrieves the ID of the current active device.\n- `cudaGetDeviceProperties` takes this device ID to fetch and populate the `cudaDeviceProp` structure with the properties of the active device.\n- The properties of the device, such as its name, total global memory, shared memory per block, registers per block, warp size, and maximum threads per block, are printed out.\n\nThis approach allows you to focus on the currently active CUDA device without needing to enumerate through all devices on the system."
