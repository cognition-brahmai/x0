It seems that using list(a) does not cause overallocation, while [x for x in a] causes overallocation at some points, and [*a] is overallocating all the time. Here are the sizes in bytes for the three methods for n from 0 to 12:\n\n```\n0 56 56 56\n1 64 88 88\n2 72 88 96\n3 80 88 104\n4 88 88 112\n5 96 120 120\n6 104 120 128\n7 112 120 136\n8 120 120 152\n9 128 184 184\n10 136 184 192\n11 144 184 200\n12 152 184 208\n```\n\nThe results were computed using Python 3.8 with the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom sys import getsizeof\n\nfor n in range(13):\n    a = [None] * n\n    print(n, getsizeof(list(a)),\n             getsizeof([x for x in a]),\n             getsizeof([*a]))\n```\n\nCan anyone explain how this works? How does [*a] overallocate and what mechanism does it use to create the result list from the given input? Does it use an iterator over a and use something like list.append? Where can I find the source code that explains this behavior?"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing with the `[*a]` syntax in Python is related to how Python's list implementation handles memory allocation and resizing. When you use different methods to create a list, they may allocate memory differently, which can lead to variations in the size of the resulting list.\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **`list(a)`**:\n   - This creates a list by directly copying the elements of `a`. The size is determined by the number of elements, and it doesn't overallocate more than necessary initially.\n\n2. **`[x for x in a]`**:\n   - This is a list comprehension and is similar to `list(a)`, but it may sometimes preallocate space if it can predict the size of the resulting list to improve performance. However, in your example, it seems to allocate just enough space for the elements.\n\n3. **`[*a]`**:\n   - The `[ *a ]` syntax is known as iterable unpacking. It unpacks the elements of `a` into a new list. The observed overallocation is likely due to Python's internal optimization for list resizing.\n   - Python lists are dynamic arrays, and they overallocate to minimize the need for resizing (which is an expensive operation). When the list needs more capacity, it typically grows by a factor (often around 1.125 to 1.5 times the current size) to leave room for additional elements without needing immediate resizing.\n   - The `[*a]` syntax might trigger this resizing strategy more aggressively, leading to apparent overallocation.\n\n### Source Code\n\nThe behavior is implemented in CPython, the reference implementation of Python. If you want to explore the source code, you can look into the CPython repository on GitHub. The relevant parts are typically found in the listobject.c file, which handles list operations.\n\n- **List Allocation Strategy**: The strategy for list resizing can be found in functions like `list_resize()` in the CPython source. This function determines how much extra space to allocate when expanding a list.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nDifferent methods of list creation can trigger different memory allocation strategies. The `[*a]` syntax appears to aggressively trigger overallocation due to its use of iterable unpacking and the subsequent resizing strategy employed by Python lists.\n\nIf you're interested in the exact details, browsing the CPython source and reading the comments within the `listobject.c` file will provide more in-depth understanding."
