        "content": "The code you've provided uses the Stanford CoreNLP library to process the sentence and extract direct and indirect objects. However, there is a small mistake in the logic for extracting the indirect object. \n\nIn the sentence \"The toddler handed the cookie to her grandmother,\" the direct object is \"the cookie,\" and the indirect object is \"her grandmother.\" The code mistakenly identifies the subject as the indirect object.\n\nTo extract the correct direct and indirect objects, you need to adjust the logic slightly. Here's an updated version of your code:\n\n```java\nimport edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.*;\nimport edu.stanford.nlp.util.*;\nimport edu.stanford.nlp.ling.*;\nimport edu.stanford.nlp.naturalli.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class ObjectExtractor {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Properties props = new Properties();\n        props.setProperty(\"annotators\", \"tokenize, ssplit, pos, lemma, parse, depparse, natlog, openie\");\n        StanfordCoreNLP pipeline = new StanfordCoreNLP(props);\n        \n        String sentence = \"The toddler handed the cookie to her grandmother\";\n        Annotation doc = new Annotation(sentence);\n        pipeline.annotate(doc);\n        \n        List<CoreMap> sentences = doc.get(CoreAnnotations.SentencesAnnotation.class);\n        for (CoreMap sent : sentences) {\n            for (RelationTriple triple : sent.get(NaturalLogicAnnotations.RelationTriplesAnnotation.class)) {\n                if (triple.relationLemmaGloss().equals(\"hand\")) {\n                    // Extract the correct objects\n                    String directObject = \"\";\n                    String indirectObject = \"\";\n                    \n                    // Find the direct and indirect objects by examining the relation triple\n                    for (CoreLabel token : sent.get(CoreAnnotations.TokensAnnotation.class)) {\n                        String word = token.word();\n                        if (triple.objectGloss().contains(word)) {\n                            directObject = triple.objectGloss();\n                        }\n                        if (triple.canonicalArgumentGloss(1).contains(word)) {\n                            indirectObject = triple.canonicalArgumentGloss(1);\n                        }\n                    }\n\n                    System.out.println(\"Direct object: \" + directObject);\n                    System.out.println(\"Indirect object: \" + indirectObject);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this revised version, I considered using `triple.objectGloss()` for finding the direct object and `triple.canonicalArgumentGloss(1)` for the indirect object. This should yield the correct objects:\n\n- Direct object: cookie\n- Indirect object: her grandmother\n\nEnsure that you have the Stanford CoreNLP library and its dependencies correctly set up in your project to run this code."
