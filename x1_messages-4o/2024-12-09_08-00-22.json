        "content": "Yes, you can make the computation of the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) more efficient by using NumPy's built-in functions. NumPy provides functions that can be used to compute cumulative sums directly, which will significantly speed up your calculations.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use NumPy's `np.cumsum` function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Assuming data is a 2D numpy array of shape (width, height)\ndata = np.random.randint(0, 4096, size=(width, height))\n\n# Flatten the data array and compute the histogram\nhisto, _ = np.histogram(data, bins=4096, range=(0, 4096))\n\n# Compute the cumulative distribution function using cumsum\ncdf = np.cumsum(histo)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`np.histogram`**: This function computes the histogram of the data in a single step, which is more efficient than manual iteration. The `bins` parameter is set to 4096 because you're working with values in that range. The `range` parameter ensures that the histogram considers values from 0 to 4096.\n\n2. **`np.cumsum`**: This function computes the cumulative sum of the histogram array, giving you the CDF directly.\n\nThis approach utilizes NumPy's optimized functions to handle the computations and should be significantly faster than iterating through loops in pure Python."
