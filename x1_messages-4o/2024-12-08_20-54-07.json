Let's say this is Column B.\n\n2. **Generate Random Numbers**: In the first cell of the new column (B2), enter the formula `=RAND()`. This formula generates a random number.\n\n3. **Fill Down the Formula**: Drag the fill handle (a small square at the bottom-right corner of the cell) down to fill the formula in all adjacent cells in the column. This will give you a column of random numbers corresponding to each word.\n\n4. **Sort the Data**: Select both columns (A and B), go to the \"Data\" tab in Excel, and click on \"Sort\". Choose to sort by the column with the random numbers (Column B). \n\n5. **Remove the Helper Column**: Once the words are randomized, you can delete the column with the random numbers.\n\nYour words will now be in a randomized order in Column A."
