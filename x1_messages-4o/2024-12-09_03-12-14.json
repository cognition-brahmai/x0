Whenever I try to add another column 'b' to df, it ends up renaming the existing column to 'ab' or refuses to add the column because there is no defined index. How can I add a separate column 'b' to df and ensure that df.empty stays True? \n\nHere are some of the methods I have tried:\n\nAt first, I attempted to rename the column like this:\n\n```python\ndf.columns=df.columns+'b'\n```\n\nBut it just renamed the column to 'ab' instead of adding a new one. I also tried this:\n\n```python\ndf.columns=df.columns.tolist()+['b']\n```\n\nBut it didn't add the column either. Lastly, I tried using .loc:\n\n```python\ndf.loc[:,'b']=None\n```\n\nBut it returned the following error:\n\n```python\nCannot set dataframe with no defined index and a scalar\n```\n\nWhat should I do?"

        "content": "To add columns to an empty DataFrame without any data while keeping it empty, you need to make sure you define both the columns and the index properly. Since you want to keep the DataFrame empty but still define the structure with columns, you can use the following approach:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create an empty DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame()\n\n# Add columns to the DataFrame\ndf2 = pd.DataFrame(columns=['a', 'b'])\n\n# Check if df2 is still empty\nprint(df2.empty)  # Should print True\nprint(df2)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `pd.DataFrame(columns=['a', 'b'])`: This creates a new DataFrame with the specified column names but no rows, keeping it empty.\n- `df2.empty`: This will return `True`, indicating that the DataFrame is still empty, but it has the specified column structure.\n\nThis approach ensures that you have the desired column structure in your DataFrame while maintaining its empty state."
