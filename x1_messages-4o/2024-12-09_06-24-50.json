What am I doing wrong?"

        "content": "From the code you provided, it seems that the issue lies in how you are updating `theta` within the loop. Specifically, you are overwriting `theta` in each iteration with the same value for both parameters, due to how you are handling the update with the `temp` array. The critical error is that you are updating `theta` with `temp` after it has been partially updated. This causes both `theta[0]` and `theta[1]` to be set to the same value.\n\nHere is a corrected version of your gradient descent function:\n\n```python\ndef gradient(X_norm, y, theta, alpha, m, n, num_it):\n    for i in range(num_it):\n        h = np.dot(X_norm, theta)\n        error = h - y\n        for j in range(n):\n            term = np.dot(error.T, X_norm[:, j])\n            theta[j] = theta[j] - (alpha / m) * term\n    return theta\n```\n\nKey changes:\n\n1. Removed the `temp` array and updated `theta` directly within the loop.\n2. Added a nested loop to update each component of `theta` separately.\n3. Calculated the gradient update using a dot product of `error` and the respective feature column of `X_norm`.\n\nEnsure that the `featureScale` function and data setup are correctly implemented:\n\n```python\ndef featureScale(X):\n    mean = np.mean(X, axis=0)\n    std = np.std(X, axis=0)\n    X_norm = (X - mean) / std\n    return X_norm, mean, std\n\n# Example setup\nX = np.array([[2104, 3], [1600, 3], [2400, 3], [1416, 2], [3000, 4]])\ny = np.array([399900, 329900, 369000, 232000, 539900])[:, np.newaxis]\n\nX_norm, mean, std = featureScale(X)\nm = len(X)\nX_norm = np.hstack((np.ones((m, 1)), X_norm))  # Add the intercept term\nn, m = np.shape(X_norm)\nnum_it = 1500\nalpha = 0.01\ntheta = np.zeros((n, 1))\n\ntheta = gradient(X_norm, y, theta, alpha, m, n, num_it)\nprint(theta)\n```\n\nMake sure to adjust the code to your specific dataset and feature scaling function. This should resolve the discrepancy you were experiencing with the values of `theta`."
