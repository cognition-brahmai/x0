I am currently using a 64-bit Windows 10 machine. Here is a screenshot of the problem: [screenshot](https://i.stack.imgur.com/PVD3q.png).

Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Open Preferences**:\n   - Start Spyder and go to the top menu.\n   - Click on `Tools` and select `Preferences` from the dropdown menu.\n\n2. **Navigate to Help Settings**:\n   - In the Preferences window, look for the `Help` or `Editor` section in the left pane. The exact location may vary slightly depending on your Spyder version.\n\n3. **Disable Tooltips**:\n   - Within the Help or Editor settings, you should find an option related to the display of tooltips or hover hints.\n   - Uncheck or disable the option for showing tooltips or hover hints.\n\n4. **Apply and Restart**:\n   - Click `Apply` and then `OK` to save your changes.\n   - Restart Spyder to ensure that the changes take effect.\n\nThis should disable the help tooltips or pop-up windows that appear when hovering over code elements. If you wish to re-enable them in the future, you can follow the same steps and check the option again. This should help in managing the distraction or inconvenience caused by the tooltips until a permanent fix is provided in future updates."
