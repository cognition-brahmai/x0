I want to achieve this by applying a function to each row of the DataFrame. The function I want to apply is a bit computationally intensive, so I don't want to call the function multiple times. I tried two methods to achieve this - using 'apply' and using a loop - but neither of them work. Using 'apply', I wrote a function which takes a 'Series' and returns a tuple of the values I want. However, when I apply this to the DataFrame, it gives an AssertionError. Using a loop, I created two new columns of the DataFrame and set them to 'None', then looped over all of the indices and tried to modify these 'None' values, but the DataFrame didn't seem to be modified. What am I doing wrong and what is the correct way to do this?"

        "content": "To create two new columns in a pandas DataFrame by applying a function to each row, it's important to ensure that the function you define returns a tuple (or a list) of values, and then you can use `apply` with `result_type='expand'` to assign these values to the new columns. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n1. **Define the Function**: Make sure your function takes a row as input and returns a tuple with the values you want to assign to the new columns.\n\n```python\ndef my_function(row):\n    # Replace with your computational logic\n    value1 = row['column1'] * 2  # Example computation\n    value2 = row['column2'] + 10  # Example computation\n    return value1, value2\n```\n\n2. **Apply the Function**: Use the `apply` method with `axis=1` to apply the function to each row and `result_type='expand'` to expand the returned tuple into separate columns.\n\n```python\nst[['new_column1', 'new_column2']] = st.apply(my_function, axis=1, result_type='expand')\n```\n\n3. **Check the DataFrame**: Verify that the new columns have been added and contain the expected values.\n\nIf you are encountering an `AssertionError`, it's possible that the function is not consistently returning a tuple of the same length for each row. Ensure that the function always returns exactly two values.\n\nRegarding your attempt with a loop, here's how it can be done correctly:\n\n1. **Initialize New Columns**: Directly assign `None` or any default value to the new columns.\n\n```python\nst['new_column1'] = None\nst['new_column2'] = None\n```\n\n2. **Iterate and Modify Rows**: Use `DataFrame.iterrows()` to iterate over the rows and update the DataFrame.\n\n```python\nfor index, row in st.iterrows():\n    value1, value2 = my_function(row)\n    st.at[index, 'new_column1'] = value1\n    st.at[index, 'new_column2'] = value2\n```\n\nUsing `iterrows()` ensures that changes are made directly to the DataFrame. However, note that this method can be slower for large DataFrames compared to using `apply`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully compute and assign values to the new columns in your DataFrame."
