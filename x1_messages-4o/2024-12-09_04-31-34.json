Here's the example code and the output I'm currently getting:\n\n```\n$ cat e.py\nraise Exception\n$ python e.py\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"e.py\", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\n    raise Exception\nException\n$ echo $?\n1\n```"

        "content": "To modify the exit code to 3 when an exception is raised in Python while still being able to dump the full stack trace, you can use a try-except block and the `sys` module to explicitly set the exit code. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport traceback\n\ntry:\n    raise Exception\nexcept Exception as e:\n    # Print the full stack trace\n    traceback.print_exc()\n    # Exit with status code 3\n    sys.exit(3)\n```\n\nThis code will catch the exception, print the full stack trace using `traceback.print_exc()`, and then exit the program with a status code of 3 using `sys.exit(3)`.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. The `try` block contains the code that may raise an exception.\n2. The `except` block catches the exception and allows us to handle it.\n3. `traceback.print_exc()` is used to print the full stack trace to the standard error.\n4. `sys.exit(3)` sets the exit status to 3.\n\nWhen you run this modified script and check the exit status, it should now be 3 instead of 1:\n\n```bash\n$ python e.py\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"e.py\", line 4, in <module>\n    raise Exception\nException\n$ echo $?\n3\n```\n\nThis way, you can customize the exit code while preserving the stack trace output."
