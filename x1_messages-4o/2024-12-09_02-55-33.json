However, when I run this code:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\ndata = np.random.random(100000).reshape(10, 100, 100) * np.nan\nnp.seterr(all=\"ignore\")\nnp.nanmedian(data, axis=[1, 2])\n```\nI still receive a runtime warning that says: \n```python\n/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/lib/python3.4/site-p\u200c\u200backages/numpy/lib/nanfunctions.py:612: RuntimeWarning: All-NaN slice encountered warnings.warn(\"All-NaN slice encountered\", RuntimeWarning)\n```\nDespite setting numpy to ignore all errors, the warning still appears. How can I rectify this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is because the `np.seterr` function is designed to handle floating-point errors, such as division by zero, overflow, underflow, and invalid operations, but it does not suppress warnings generated by NumPy's nanfunctions, like `np.nanmedian`.\n\nTo suppress these specific warnings, you can use Python's built-in `warnings` module to filter out the warnings you're receiving from NumPy. Here's how you can modify your code to suppress the \"All-NaN slice encountered\" warning:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport warnings\n\n# Suppress the specific warning from NumPy's nanfunctions\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=RuntimeWarning, message=\"All-NaN slice encountered\")\n\ndata = np.random.random(100000).reshape(10, 100, 100) * np.nan\nnp.seterr(all=\"ignore\")\nresult = np.nanmedian(data, axis=[1, 2])\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nBy using `warnings.filterwarnings`, you can suppress the specific runtime warning that is being raised by the nanfunctions when they encounter an all-NaN slice. This approach provides finer control over which warnings to ignore, rather than suppressing all warnings globally."
