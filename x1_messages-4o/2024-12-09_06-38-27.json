        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to a misconfiguration in your Celery setup, specifically with the way you're importing and configuring your tasks. Let's break down the issue and provide a solution.\n\n### Problem Explanation\n\n1. **AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'celery'**:\n   - This error suggests that Celery is unable to find an application instance in your `tasks.py` file. The `celery` command expects to find an application instance, but it seems like the module doesn't expose one.\n\n2. **Celery Version**:\n   - You're using Celery 3.0.12, which is quite outdated. Consider upgrading to a newer version if possible, as many improvements and bug fixes have been introduced in later versions.\n\n### Solution\n\n1. **Define a Celery Application**:\n   - You need to explicitly define a Celery application instance in your `tasks.py` file. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   from celery import Celery\n\n   os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = \"proj.settings\"\n\n   app = Celery('proj')\n\n   # Load task modules from all registered Django app configs.\n   app.config_from_object('django.conf:settings', namespace='CELERY')\n   app.autodiscover_tasks()\n\n   @app.task\n   def add_photos_task(lad_id):\n       # Your task implementation here\n       pass\n   ```\n\n2. **Update the Command**:\n   - Update your Celery worker command to point to the Celery application instance:\n\n   ```bash\n   celery -A tasks.app worker --loglevel=info\n   ```\n\n3. **Ensure Django Environment**:\n   - Make sure that your Django settings are correctly configured and accessible.\n\n4. **Consider Upgrading**:\n   - If feasible, consider upgrading Celery to a more recent version. This will provide you with better features and security improvements.\n\n### Explanation of `import_from_cwd` Function\n\nThe `import_from_cwd` function is a utility that ensures Python imports prioritize the current directory over other paths in `sys.path`. Here's a breakdown of its components:\n\n- **`import_from_cwd`**:\n  - **Purpose**: To import a module while giving precedence to modules located in the current directory.\n  - **`imp` Parameter**: The import function to use. Defaults to Python's `importlib.import_module` if not provided.\n  - **`cwd_in_path` Context Manager**: Temporarily adds the current directory to the front of `sys.path` during the import operation, ensuring modules in the current directory are found first.\n  \nThis function is useful in scenarios where you have a module with the same name in multiple locations, and you want to ensure that the local (current directory) version is imported.\n\nBy following these adjustments, you should be able to resolve the error and have your Celery worker running successfully.
