The text I am applying this pattern to is \"q=http://11111.doc,q=http://22222.doc\". When I use the findall() function on this text, it matches the whole string i.e. \"q=http://11111.doc,q=http://22222.doc\", but what I want is to match the two separate URLs \"q=http://11111.doc\" and \"q=http://22222.doc\". How can I correct my regex to get the desired output?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired output of matching each URL separately, you can adjust your regex pattern slightly and use `findall()` to capture the individual components of the string. The main issue is that the regex pattern is currently matching everything from \"q=http://\" to \".doc\", including any characters in between, due to the greedy nature of `.*`. You need to modify the pattern to ensure it stops at the first occurrence of \".doc\".\n\nHere's how you can adjust your regex pattern:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ntext = \"q=http://11111.doc,q=http://22222.doc\"\npattern = r\"q=http://[^,]*\\.doc\"\n\nmatches = re.findall(pattern, text)\nprint(matches)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- `q=http://` matches the literal string \"q=http://\".\n- `[^,]*` is a negated character class that matches zero or more characters that are not commas. This ensures that the pattern does not consume characters beyond a single URL.\n- `\\.doc` matches the literal string \".doc\".\n\nUsing this pattern, `findall()` will give you the correct output:\n\n```\n['q=http://11111.doc', 'q=http://22222.doc']\n```\n\nThis way, each URL is matched separately as expected."
