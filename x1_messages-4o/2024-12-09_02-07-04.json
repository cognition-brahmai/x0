But I am not able to accomplish the basic task of applying any kind of border to any cell. I tried to modify the default style from the Openpyxl documentation, however, it results in a `TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'superscript'`. Also, when I tried copying from another example here, it gives me `AttributeError: type object 'Border' has no attribute 'BORDER_THIN'` even after fixing the typos and insufficient import errors. Can anyone provide a code snippet that will put a border around any cell in a workbook?"

        "content": "Certainly! It looks like you're encountering issues due to potentially outdated documentation or mismatched library versions. In OpenPyxl 2.0.4, applying borders to cells should be done using the `Border`, `Side`, and `openpyxl.styles` modules.\n\nHere's a simple code snippet to apply a border around a specific cell in your workbook:\n\n```python\nfrom openpyxl import Workbook\nfrom openpyxl.styles import Border, Side\n\n# Create a new Workbook\nwb = Workbook()\nws = wb.active\n\n# Define the style for the border\nthin_border = Border(\n    left=Side(style='thin'),\n    right=Side(style='thin'),\n    top=Side(style='thin'),\n    bottom=Side(style='thin')\n)\n\n# Select a cell and apply the border\ncell = ws['A1']\ncell.value = \"Hello\"\ncell.border = thin_border\n\n# Save the workbook\nwb.save(\"border_example.xlsx\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Border & Side:** The `Border` class specifies border styles for each side of a cell. The `Side` class is used to define the style, color, and border thickness.\n2. **Style Options:** Common styles include `'thin'`, `'medium'`, `'dashed'`, `'dotted'`, etc.\n3. **Apply to Cell:** Once the `Border` object is defined, assign it to the `border` attribute of a cell.\n\nThis example will create an Excel file named `border_example.xlsx` and apply a thin border around cell `A1`. Make sure that your OpenPyxl library is correctly installed and that you are using the correct versions as mentioned in your setup. If you still encounter issues, consider upgrading OpenPyxl to a more recent version if possible, as older versions might have unpatched bugs."
