We can achieve this by conserving energy.\"\nlet reversedText = reverseSentences(in: text)\nprint(reversedText)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Regular Expression**: The regular expression `(?<=[.!?])\\\\s+` is used to split the text into sentences. This pattern looks for one or more whitespace characters (`\\\\s+`) that are preceded by a period, exclamation mark, or question mark (`(?<=[.!?])`).\n\n2. **Split the Text**: The text is split into an array of sentences using this regular expression.\n\n3. **Reverse the Order**: The array of sentences is then reversed.\n\n4. **Join Sentences**: Finally, the reversed sentences are joined back together into a single string, with a space character as the separator.\n\nThis code provides a simple way to reverse the order of sentences in a given text. Note that this approach assumes sentences are well-formed and ends with one of the punctuation marks specified."
