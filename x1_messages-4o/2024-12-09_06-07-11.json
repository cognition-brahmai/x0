I have my settings.py set up as follows:\n\n```python\nDATABASES = {\n    'default': {\n        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',\n        'NAME': 'banco1',\n        'USER': 'root',\n        'PASSWORD': '123',\n        'HOST': 'localhost',\n        'PORT': '',\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd my local_settings.py is configured as such:\n\n```python\nDATABASES = {\n    'default': {\n        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',\n        'NAME': 'banco2',\n        'USER': 'root',\n        'PASSWORD': '123',\n        'HOST': 'localhost',\n        'PORT': '',\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, it seems like the local_settings.py does not override the settings.py as expected. What could be wrong?"

        "content": "In Django 1.2, to override settings using a `local_settings.py` file, you typically need to manually import and override settings within your `settings.py`. It doesn't happen automatically. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Import the local settings at the end of your `settings.py` file.** This ensures that any settings specified in `local_settings.py` will override those in `settings.py`.\n\n2. **Handle the import in a way that doesn't break your project if `local_settings.py` doesn't exist (e.g., in a production environment).**\n\nHere's how you can modify your `settings.py`:\n\n```python\n# settings.py\n\nDATABASES = {\n    'default': {\n        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',\n        'NAME': 'banco1',\n        'USER': 'root',\n        'PASSWORD': '123',\n        'HOST': 'localhost',\n        'PORT': '',\n    }\n}\n\n# Try importing local settings\ntry:\n    from local_settings import *\nexcept ImportError:\n    pass\n```\n\nIn this setup, the `try-except` block attempts to import all settings from `local_settings.py`. If `local_settings.py` isn't present, it simply skips the import, allowing your project to use the default settings specified in `settings.py`.\n\n3. **Ensure `local_settings.py` is in the same directory as `settings.py`** and is not tracked by version control if it contains sensitive information. You can add it to `.gitignore` if you're using Git.\n\nOnce you have this setup, `local_settings.py` should successfully override the settings in `settings.py`. Make sure to restart your Django server after making these changes to ensure they take effect."
