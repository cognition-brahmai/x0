I have considered a hack-ish way of doing this by having a `__setattr__` method as follows:\n\n```python\ndef __setattr__(self, attribute, value):\n    if not attribute in self.__dict__:\n        print \"Cannot set %s\" % attribute\n    else:\n        self.__dict__[attribute] = value\n```\nIn this method, I would then directly edit `__dict__` inside `__init__`. However, I wonder if there is a more proper or efficient way to achieve this?"

        "content": "To achieve the behavior where a class instance in Python does not accept new attributes after initialization but allows modification of existing ones, you can indeed use a custom `__setattr__` method as you've shown. However, there is a more idiomatic way to do this using Python's `__slots__` feature or by refining your `__setattr__` method approach.\n\n### Using `__slots__`\nBy defining `__slots__` in your class, you restrict what attributes can be added to instances of the class. This approach not only prevents adding new attributes but also saves memory:\n\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n    __slots__ = ['attribute1', 'attribute2']  # Define your attributes here\n\n    def __init__(self, attribute1, attribute2):\n        self.attribute1 = attribute1\n        self.attribute2 = attribute2\n\n# Usage\nobj = MyClass(10, 20)\nobj.attribute1 = 30  # Modification is allowed\nobj.new_attribute = 40  # Raises AttributeError\n```\n\n### Using `__setattr__`\nIf you prefer more control over the attribute setting process and want to keep using `__setattr__`, you can refine it as follows:\n\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n    def __init__(self, attribute1, attribute2):\n        self.attribute1 = attribute1\n        self.attribute2 = attribute2\n        self._initialized = True\n\n    def __setattr__(self, name, value):\n        # Allow setting new attributes only during initialization\n        if not hasattr(self, '_initialized') or name in self.__dict__:\n            super().__setattr__(name, value)\n        else:\n            raise AttributeError(f\"Cannot set new attribute '{name}'\")\n\n# Usage\nobj = MyClass(10, 20)\nobj.attribute1 = 30  # Modification is allowed\nobj.new_attribute = 40  # Raises AttributeError\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **`__slots__`:** This defines a static set of attributes that instances of the class can have. It prevents the creation of `__dict__` for each instance, optimizing memory usage.\n- **`__setattr__`:** This method provides finer control. By checking if `_initialized` is set, you allow attribute assignments during `__init__` and restrict new ones afterward.\n\nChoose the method that best suits your needs. If memory optimization and simplicity are priorities, go with `__slots__`. If you anticipate needing more complex logic for attribute management, refine the `__setattr__` method."
