For example, I have classes like `MessageDisplay`, `FriendlyMessageDisplay`, and `FriendlyMessagePrinter`. When trying to instantiate `MessageDisplay` or `FriendlyMessageDisplay` classes, I am getting a `TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class MessageDisplay with abstract methods say`. So, how can I check if a given class object is an abstract class, that is, it cannot be instantiated?"

        "content": "In Python, you can determine if a given class is an abstract class by using the `abc` module, which provides tools for defining abstract base classes. Specifically, you can check if the class in question has any abstract methods that have not been implemented. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Import the `abc` module**: Ensure that your classes are using the `abc` module to define abstract base classes and abstract methods.\n\n2. **Use the `inspect` module**: You can use the `inspect` module to check if a class is an abstract class by checking if it has any unimplemented abstract methods.\n\nHere is a sample code that demonstrates how you can check if a class is abstract:\n\n```python\nimport abc\nimport inspect\n\n# Example abstract class\nclass MessageDisplay(abc.ABC):\n    @abc.abstractmethod\n    def say(self):\n        pass\n\nclass FriendlyMessageDisplay(MessageDisplay):\n    pass\n\nclass FriendlyMessagePrinter(FriendlyMessageDisplay):\n    def say(self):\n        print(\"Hello, friend!\")\n\ndef is_abstract(cls):\n    return bool(getattr(cls, '__abstractmethods__', False))\n\n# Check if the classes are abstract\nprint(is_abstract(MessageDisplay))  # Output: True\nprint(is_abstract(FriendlyMessageDisplay))  # Output: True\nprint(is_abstract(FriendlyMessagePrinter))  # Output: False\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- `MessageDisplay` is an abstract class because it has the abstract method `say` which is not implemented.\n- `FriendlyMessageDisplay` is also considered abstract because it doesn't implement the `say` method.\n- `FriendlyMessagePrinter` is a concrete class because it provides an implementation of the `say` method.\n\nThe function `is_abstract(cls)` checks whether the class has any abstract methods that are yet to be implemented by verifying the `__abstractmethods__` attribute. If this attribute is non-empty, the class is considered abstract."
