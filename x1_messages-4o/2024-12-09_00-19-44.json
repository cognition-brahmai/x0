In this [post](https://mpatacchiola.github.io/blog/2017/01/29/dissecting-reinforcement-learning-3.html) that I am studying from, the update rule of TD(0) is clear to me. However, I am struggling to understand how in TD(\u03bb), the utility values of all the previous states are updated in a single update. According to the explanation given, in TD(\u03bb) the result is propagated back to all the previous states via the eligibility traces. But looking at the update rule with eligibility traces, it seems we're only updating the utility of a single state `Ut(s)`. How then are the utilities of all the previous states getting updated? Also, if this update is applied for every single step, wouldn't the values of delta be zero initially (since rewards and utility function is initialized to 0), resulting in the utility values for previous states being zero in the first update? Lastly, in this python implementation provided, why are only 2 values updated instead of all 5 previous states as shown in the figure?"

        "content": "Understanding Temporal Difference (TD) learning, particularly TD(\u03bb), can be complex due to the nature of eligibility traces and how they influence the update process. Let me break it down for you:\n\n### Differences Between TD(0) and TD(\u03bb)\n\n1. **TD(0):** In TD(0), the update rule is straightforward. You only update the utility (or value) of the current state based on the observed reward and the estimated value of the next state. The update is done using the formula:\n\n   \\[\n   V(s) \\leftarrow V(s) + \\alpha [R + \\gamma V(s') - V(s)]\n   \\]\n\n   Here, `V(s)` is the value of the current state, `R` is the reward received, `\u03b3` is the discount factor, and `\u03b1` is the learning rate.\n\n2. **TD(\u03bb):** TD(\u03bb) extends this by introducing eligibility traces, which allow the algorithm to update multiple previous states simultaneously. The eligibility trace for each state determines how much that state's value should be adjusted based on the current TD error (`\u03b4`).\n\n   The update rule for TD(\u03bb) is:\n\n   \\[\n   V(s) \\leftarrow V(s) + \\alpha \\cdot \\delta \\cdot E(s)\n   \\]\n\n   Where `E(s)` is the eligibility trace for state `s`, and `\u03b4` (delta) is the TD error computed as:\n\n   \\[\n   \\delta = R + \\gamma V(s') - V(s)\n   \\]\n\n### How Previous States Are Updated\n\nIn TD(\u03bb), when you receive a reward at a particular time step, the update is not limited to the current state. Instead, all previous states are updated proportionally to their eligibility traces. The eligibility trace `E(s)` for each state is updated at each step and decays over time, typically using a decay factor `\u03bb` (lambda), which controls the decay rate.\n\nThe eligibility trace is updated as follows:\n\n- When a state is visited, its eligibility is incremented: \\( E(s) \\leftarrow E(s) + 1 \\)\n- At each step, for all states, the eligibility trace decays: \\( E(s) \\leftarrow \\gamma \\lambda E(s) \\)\n\nThis means that states visited recently (with higher eligibility traces) receive larger updates when the TD error is propagated back, thus enabling learning from delayed rewards.\n\n### Initial Updates and Zero Delta\n\nIn the initial updates, when both the rewards and utility values are zero, the delta (`\u03b4`) will indeed be zero. However, as the agent interacts with the environment and starts receiving non-zero rewards, the deltas will become non-zero, allowing the value updates to propagate effectively through the eligibility traces.\n\n### Python Implementation and Updating\n\nIn the Python implementation you mentioned, it's possible that the eligibility traces or the decay factor might be set in such a way that only a subset of states receives significant updates at each step. This could be due to how the trace decay is configured or how frequently each state is visited.\n\nIf only two values are updated instead of all five, it might be due to:\n\n- **Eligibility Trace Decay:** The eligibility traces for some states might have decayed to a very small value, resulting in negligible updates for those states.\n- **State Visit Frequency:** Some states might not have been visited recently, leading to smaller eligibility traces.\n\nTo better understand the specific behavior of the implementation, you might want to examine the eligibility trace values and how they evolve over time. This will give you insights into why only certain states are being updated significantly."
