For example, to calculate the average sales for the East region, use the formula:\n=AVERAGE(B2:M2)\nTo calculate the average sales for the West region, use the formula:\n=AVERAGE(B3:M3)\nAnd so on for the other regions."

        "content": "To calculate the average sales for each region in the year 2021 using Excel, you can apply the AVERAGE function to each row representing a region. Here\u2019s how you would do it for each region based on the data you provided:\n\n1. **East Region**:  \n   Use the formula `=AVERAGE(B2:M2)` to calculate the average sales for the East region. This formula will calculate the average of the sales figures from January to December for the East region.\n\n2. **West Region**:  \n   Use the formula `=AVERAGE(B3:M3)` to calculate the average sales for the West region. This formula will calculate the average of the sales figures from January to December for the West region.\n\n3. **North Region**:  \n   Use the formula `=AVERAGE(B4:M4)` to calculate the average sales for the North region. This formula will calculate the average of the sales figures from January to December for the North region.\n\n4. **South Region**:  \n   Use the formula `=AVERAGE(B5:M5)` to calculate the average sales for the South region. This formula will calculate the average of the sales figures from January to December for the South region.\n\nTo implement this in Excel:\n\n- Click on the cell where you want to display the average sales for the East region and enter `=AVERAGE(B2:M2)`.\n- Repeat the process for the West, North, and South regions using the corresponding formulas shown above.\n\nThis will give you the average sales for each region for the entire year 2021."
