Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Given file path\nfile_path = \"/path/to/some/file.txt\"\n\n# Get the base name (the file name with extension)\nbase_name = os.path.basename(file_path)\n\n# Split the base name into name and extension\nfile_name, file_extension = os.path.splitext(base_name)\n\nprint(file_name)  # Output: file\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- `os.path.basename(file_path)` extracts the file name with its extension from the full path.\n- `os.path.splitext(base_name)` splits the file name into the name and extension, where `file_name` will be the name without the extension."
