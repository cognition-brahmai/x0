If you have a table named `products` with a column `price` that stores the price of each product, you can use the following SQL query to retrieve a list of products with a price below $10:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM products\nWHERE price < 10;\n```\n\nThis query selects all columns from the `products` table where the `price` is less than $10. If you need only specific columns, you can replace the `*` with the column names you are interested in, such as `product_name`, `price`, etc."
