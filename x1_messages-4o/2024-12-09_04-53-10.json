The code for the model is as follows:\n\n```python\n# RNN Model (Many-to-One)\nclass RNN(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, num_classes):\n        super(RNN, self).__init__()\n        self.hidden_size = hidden_size\n        self.num_layers = num_layers\n        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True)\n        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Set initial states \n        h0 = Variable(torch.zeros(self.num_layers, x.size(0), self.hidden_size)) \n        c0 = Variable(torch.zeros(self.num_layers, x.size(0), self.hidden_size))\n\n        # Forward propagate RNN\n        out, _ = self.lstm(x, (h0, c0))  \n\n        # Decode hidden state of last time step\n        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :])  \n        return out\n```\n\nI am confused about these lines:\n\n```python\nh0 = Variable(torch.zeros(self.num_layers, x.size(0), self.hidden_size)) \nc0 = Variable(torch.zeros(self.num_layers, x.size(0), self.hidden_size))\n```\n\nAs I understand it, `forward()` is called for every training example. But this would mean that the hidden state and cell state would be reset i.e., replaced with a matrix of zeros for every training example. The names `h0` and `c0` suggest that these are the hidden/cell state at t=0, but why are these zero matrices handed over to the LSTM with every training example? Even if these are ignored after the first call, it doesn't seem like a very good solution. When I test the code, it shows an accuracy of 97% on the MNIST set, so it seems to work this way, but it doesn't make sense to me. Can someone clarify this?"

        "content": "Your observation is correct, and it's an important aspect of how RNNs, including LSTMs, are typically used for training.\n\nIn the code snippet you provided, the lines:\n\n```python\nh0 = Variable(torch.zeros(self.num_layers, x.size(0), self.hidden_size)) \nc0 = Variable(torch.zeros(self.num_layers, x.size(0), self.hidden_size))\n```\n\nare indeed initializing the hidden state (`h0`) and cell state (`c0`) to zero for each batch of input data. This is done at the beginning of processing each sequence, which is typical for many-to-one sequence models like the one being implemented here.\n\nHere\u2019s why this approach is usually used:\n\n1. **Independence of Sequences**: Each training sequence is treated independently, meaning the model is not intended to carry information between different sequences during training. By resetting the hidden and cell states at the start of each sequence, you ensure that the LSTM processes each sequence independently without any carry-over from previous sequences.\n\n2. **Batch Processing**: The model processes batches of sequences during training. The `batch_first=True` argument in the LSTM layer indicates that the input tensor's shape is `(batch_size, sequence_length, input_size)`. Thus, initializing `h0` and `c0` with dimensions `(num_layers, batch_size, hidden_size)` allows the LSTM to handle each sequence in the batch in parallel.\n\n3. **Model Training**: During training, you want the model to learn from scratch for each sequence to properly adjust weights based on the error for that specific sequence. Carrying over hidden states from one sequence to the next without resetting could introduce noise and dependencies that are not present in the training data, potentially leading to poorer generalization.\n\n4. **Testing and Validation**: When evaluating the model, the same approach is used\u2014each sequence is processed independently. This is consistent with how the model was trained and ensures that performance metrics reflect the model's ability to process sequences independently.\n\nIn summary, initializing `h0` and `c0` to zero for each batch is a standard practice when training LSTM models for many-to-one tasks. It ensures that each sequence is processed independently, which is generally desirable unless you are specifically working with continuous sequences where state carry-over is meaningful (e.g., in stateful RNNs). The model's ability to achieve high accuracy on a task like MNIST suggests that this setup is appropriate for the problem at hand."
