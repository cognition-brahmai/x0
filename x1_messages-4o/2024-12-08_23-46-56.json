Here's a simple program that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_emails(text):\n    # Regular expression pattern for matching email addresses\n    email_pattern = r'[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}'\n    \n    # Find all matches of the pattern in the text\n    emails = re.findall(email_pattern, text)\n    \n    return emails\n\n# Example text\ntext = \"This is a text. sender@example.com\"\n\n# Extract emails\nemails = extract_emails(text)\n\n# Print the extracted emails\nprint(\"Extracted Emails:\", emails)\n```\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output:\n\n```\nExtracted Emails: ['sender@example.com']\n```\n\nThis program uses a regular expression to match patterns that typically represent email addresses, and then it extracts all occurrences from the provided text."
