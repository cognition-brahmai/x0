        "content": "Rhyme is a literary device used in poetry and songs to create rhythm and musicality. Here are some common types of rhyme:\n\n1. **End Rhyme**: This is the most common type of rhyme. It occurs when the last syllables or words in two or more lines rhyme with each other. For example, \"The cat sat on the mat.\"\n\n2. **Internal Rhyme**: This type of rhyme occurs within a single line of verse. For example, \"I drove myself to the lake and dove into the wake.\"\n\n3. **Slant Rhyme (or Half Rhyme)**: Also known as imperfect, near, or oblique rhyme, slant rhyme features words with similar but not identical sounds. The vowel segments might be different while the consonants are alike, or vice versa. An example is \"worm\" and \"swarm.\"\n\n4. **Identical Rhyme**: This occurs when the same word or a homophone is repeated. For instance, \"fair\" and \"fare.\"\n\n5. **Rich Rhyme**: A type of rhyme where the rhyming words sound the same but have different meanings, like \"raise\" and \"raze.\"\n\n6. **Eye Rhyme**: Words that look like they should rhyme because of their spelling, but their pronunciation is different, such as \"love\" and \"move.\"\n\n7. **Masculine Rhyme**: Rhyme that matches only one syllable, usually at the end of lines. For example, \"support\" and \"retort.\"\n\n8. **Feminine Rhyme**: A rhyme involving two or more syllables, where the final syllable(s) are unstressed, such as \"dicing\" and \"enticing.\"\n\n9. **Monorhyme**: A rhyme scheme in which all lines in a stanza or entire poem have the same end rhyme.\n\n10. **Alternate Rhyme (or Cross Rhyme)**: This is a rhyme pattern of ABAB.\n\n11. **Enclosed Rhyme**: This is a rhyme scheme in ABBA format.\n\nThese various types of rhyme are used to enhance the aesthetic quality of poetry and to help convey the emotion or theme of the piece."
