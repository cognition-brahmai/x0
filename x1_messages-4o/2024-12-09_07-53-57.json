When an HTTP request is made from the client to the service, a consistent socket.error in socket.py is raised during a particular call, displaying (104, 'Connection reset by peer'). After using Wireshark, I noticed that the server sends a RST, ACK for the problematic request as opposed to the usual FIN, ACK. Both the web service and the client are running on a Gentoo Linux x86-64 box with glibc-2.6.1. The client is a Django 1.0.2 app calling httplib2 0.4.0 for requests and the service is running Werkzeug 0.3.1. I am unable to spot the difference between a successful and a failed request on the service side. Is the issue with the service or the client? Further testing suggests that the issue could be with wsgiref or the server running on Linux. How can I resolve this?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"Connection reset by peer,\" typically indicates that the server terminated the connection unexpectedly. This can happen for several reasons, and diagnosing it involves checking both the client and server sides. Here are some steps and considerations to help resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Server Logs**: Start by examining the server logs for any errors or exceptions that might be logged around the time the connection resets. This can provide clues about what's causing the server to send an RST packet.\n\n2. **Resource Limits**: Ensure that the server isn't hitting any resource limits, such as memory or file descriptors. Check the ulimit settings and adjust them if necessary.\n\n3. **Timeouts**: Look into the timeout settings for both the client and server. The server might be configured to close connections after a certain period of inactivity, which could be causing the reset.\n\n4. **Network Configuration**: Verify the network configuration on the server. Firewalls or network security settings might be prematurely closing connections.\n\n5. **WSGI Middleware**: Since you're using Werkzeug and wsgiref, check if there's any middleware or configuration that might be affecting the request handling. Ensure that any middleware is properly handling exceptions and not abruptly closing connections.\n\n6. **Testing with Different Configurations**: Try running the web service with a different WSGI server, such as Gunicorn or uWSGI. This can help determine if the issue is specific to the WSGI server implementation.\n\n7. **Update Libraries**: Consider updating the libraries you're using, if possible. Django 1.0.2, Werkzeug 0.3.1, and httplib2 0.4.0 are quite dated, and there may be bug fixes or improvements in newer versions that could resolve the issue.\n\n8. **Verbose Logging**: Enable verbose logging for both the client and server to capture more detailed information about the request and response cycle. This can help identify where things go wrong.\n\n9. **Wireshark Analysis**: Since you've already used Wireshark, take a closer look at the TCP stream to see if there's any pattern or specific data that's causing the server to reset the connection.\n\n10. **Test with Simplified Code**: Create a minimal version of the client and server to isolate the problem. This can help determine if the issue lies within a specific part of your code.\n\nBy systematically examining these areas, you should be able to pinpoint the source of the problem and find a suitable solution."
