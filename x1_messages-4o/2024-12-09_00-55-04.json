        "content": "The behavior you're experiencing, where Python sets module globals to `None` during shutdown, is not specific to Python 2; it also exists in Python 3. This is part of Python's interpreter shutdown process, which involves cleaning up modules and their associated resources.\n\nDuring the shutdown, Python attempts to clean up all the modules by setting their global variables to `None`. This can cause issues if there are any finalization or cleanup tasks in your code that rely on these globals, especially in a multithreaded environment where threads might still be running as the interpreter is shutting down.\n\nHere's a brief overview of the shutdown sequence in Python:\n\n1. **Termination of Threads:** Threads are not automatically joined or cleaned up. If any non-daemon threads are still running, the interpreter will wait for them to complete. Daemon threads are terminated abruptly.\n\n2. **Module Cleanup:** Python attempts to execute `__del__` methods of objects, flush data to disk, and more. During this phase, the interpreter sets module globals to `None`.\n\n3. **Interpreter Finalization:** The final step involves releasing any remaining resources and shutting down the interpreter itself.\n\nTo handle this behavior, you can:\n\n- Avoid relying on module-level globals in finalizers or during the shutdown phase.\n- Use `atexit` module to register functions that should be executed upon normal interpreter termination.\n- Ensure proper cleanup of resources and threads before the interpreter starts its shutdown process.\n\nFor further information, you can refer to the official Python documentation and look for sections related to the interpreter lifecycles, such as:\n\n- Python 2: The Python Library Reference provides details about the global interpreter lock (GIL) and the `atexit` module.\n- Python 3: The Python Standard Library documentation, which includes information on threading, `atexit`, and other relevant modules.\n\nIn case you want to dive deeper, examining the Python source code, especially the `Py_Finalize` function, can provide insights into how the shutdown process is handled internally."
