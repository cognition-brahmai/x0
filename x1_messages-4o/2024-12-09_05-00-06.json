I have a list of extensions and a filename, and I want to check if the filename ends with one of the extensions. I have the following code, but I remember that the explicit declaration of the `for` loop can be avoided and be written in the `if` condition. Is this true?\n\n```python\nextensions = ['.mp3','.avi']\nfile_name = 'test.mp3'\n\nfor extension in extensions:\n    if file_name.endswith(extension):\n        #do stuff\n```"

Here is how you can do it:\n\n```python\nextensions = ['.mp3', '.avi']\nfile_name = 'test.mp3'\n\nif any(file_name.endswith(extension) for extension in extensions):\n    # do stuff\n```\n\nThe `any()` function returns `True` if at least one of the conditions in the generator expression is `True`. This way, you can avoid explicitly declaring the `for` loop."
