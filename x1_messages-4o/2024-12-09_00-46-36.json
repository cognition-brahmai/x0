This issue can be reproduced with pip version 20.3.0 when trying to install pyarrow version 2.0.0 and azureml-defaults version 1.18.0. The command I am using is as follows: \n```python\npip install pyarrow==2.0.0 azureml-defaults==1.18.0\n```\nIs there a way to resolve this?"

        "content": "This issue arises from dependency conflicts between the specified versions of `pyarrow` and `azureml-defaults`. In pip version 20.3.0 and beyond, a new dependency resolver was introduced, which is stricter and may cause infinite loops when it encounters unresolvable conflicts.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can try the following approaches:\n\n1. **Upgrade pip**: Ensure that you are using the latest version of pip, as newer versions may have improvements and bug fixes for the dependency resolver.\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade pip\n   ```\n\n2. **Use the `--use-deprecated=legacy-resolver` flag**: If upgrading pip doesn't resolve the issue, you can attempt to use the legacy resolver temporarily. Note that this is a short-term solution and it\u2019s recommended to eventually resolve the dependency conflicts.\n   ```bash\n   pip install pyarrow==2.0.0 azureml-defaults==1.18.0 --use-deprecated=legacy-resolver\n   ```\n\n3. **Identify and resolve dependency conflicts manually**: You can manually identify the conflicting dependencies and try to find compatible versions. You can use tools like `pipdeptree` to visualize the dependency tree.\n   ```bash\n   pip install pipdeptree\n   pipdeptree\n   ```\n\n4. **Isolate environments**: Consider using virtual environments to isolate your dependencies. This allows you to experiment with different versions without affecting your global Python environment.\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `myenv\\Scripts\\activate`\n   pip install pyarrow==2.0.0 azureml-defaults==1.18.0\n   ```\n\n5. **Check for updated packages**: Sometimes, newer versions of packages may have resolved the dependency conflicts. Check if there are newer versions of `pyarrow` or `azureml-defaults` that are compatible with each other.\n\nBy using one or a combination of these methods, you should be able to resolve the dependency conflict issue you're facing."
