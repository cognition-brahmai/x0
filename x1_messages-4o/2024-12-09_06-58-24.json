        "content": "To invert the colors of an image using the Python Imaging Library (PIL), you can use the `ImageOps` module which provides a convenient function called `invert()`. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve the inversion of colors, specifically converting white letters on a black background to black letters on a white background:\n\n1. **Install Pillow**: First, ensure you have the Pillow library installed, which is the modern fork of PIL. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install Pillow\n   ```\n\n2. **Invert the Image**: You can use the following Python script to invert the colors of your image:\n\n   ```python\n   from PIL import Image, ImageOps\n\n   # Open an image file\n   image_path = 'path_to_your_image.jpg'  # Replace with your image path\n   image = Image.open(image_path)\n\n   # Invert the image\n   inverted_image = ImageOps.invert(image)\n\n   # Save or display the inverted image\n   inverted_image.save('inverted_image.jpg')  # Save the inverted image\n   inverted_image.show()                      # Display the inverted image\n   ```\n\n3. **Handling Different Modes**: If your image is in a mode other than \"RGB\" (for example, \"L\" for grayscale), you might need to convert it first before applying the inversion:\n\n   ```python\n   if image.mode != 'RGB':\n       image = image.convert('RGB')\n   ```\n\n4. **Grayscale Images**: For grayscale images, you can directly use the `invert` function without mode conversion:\n\n   ```python\n   if image.mode == 'L':\n       inverted_image = ImageOps.invert(image)\n   ```\n\nThis script will invert the colors of your image, effectively turning white letters on a black background into black letters on a white background. Adjust the `image_path` variable with the path to your specific image file."
