When I attempt to create a virtual environment using Python 2.7, I receive the error \"No module named zlib\". I have tried uncommenting the relevant line in the `Setup` file located in `~/.pythonbrew/pythons/Python-2.7.1/lib/python2.7/config`, but I continue to receive the same error. How can I correctly install the `zlib` module so that I can create virtual environments with Python 2.7?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is likely due to Python not being compiled with the `zlib` module, which is a common dependency. This often happens if the necessary development libraries for `zlib` are not present on your system when compiling Python. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Install zlib development libraries:**\n   Before compiling Python with Pythonbrew, ensure that you have the `zlib` development libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev\n   ```\n\n2. **Reinstall Python Version:**\n   Once the `zlib` development libraries are installed, you will need to reinstall your desired Python version using Pythonbrew:\n\n   ```bash\n   pythonbrew uninstall 2.7.1\n   pythonbrew install 2.7.1\n   ```\n\n   During this process, Pythonbrew will recompile Python, and it should now include the `zlib` module since the necessary libraries are present.\n\n3. **Verify zlib Module:**\n   After the installation, verify that the `zlib` module is available:\n\n   ```bash\n   pythonbrew use 2.7.1\n   python\n   ```\n\n   Then, within the Python interactive shell, try importing `zlib`:\n\n   ```python\n   import zlib\n   ```\n\n   If you don't see any errors, the `zlib` module is correctly installed.\n\n4. **Create Virtual Environment:**\n   Now, you should be able to create a virtual environment without encountering the `zlib` error:\n\n   ```bash\n   pythonbrew venv create myenv\n   ```\n\nFollowing these steps should resolve the issue, allowing you to manage and create virtual environments with Python 2.7 on your Ubuntu 10.10 system."
