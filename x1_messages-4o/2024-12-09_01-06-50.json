        "content": "In PyTorch, the `model.eval()` and `model.train()` methods primarily affect certain layers that have different behaviors during training and inference. While the official documentation specifically mentions `Dropout` and `BatchNorm`, these are the most commonly affected layers. However, any custom module that overrides the `training` attribute can also behave differently depending on whether the model is in training or evaluation mode.\n\nHere's a more detailed list of standard layers/modules that are commonly affected:\n\n1. **Dropout Layers (`nn.Dropout`, `nn.Dropout2d`, etc.)**:\n   - In training mode (`model.train()`), dropout randomly zeroes some of the elements of the input tensor with a probability `p` using samples from a Bernoulli distribution.\n   - In evaluation mode (`model.eval()`), dropout is effectively turned off, and the outputs are scaled by a factor of `1/p`.\n\n2. **Batch Normalization Layers (`nn.BatchNorm1d`, `nn.BatchNorm2d`, etc.)**:\n   - In training mode, these layers use batch statistics to normalize inputs and update running estimates of the mean and variance.\n   - In evaluation mode, they use the running estimates for normalization.\n\n3. **Custom Modules**:\n   - Any custom module that defines a `training` attribute can have different behavior based on its value. Developers can override the `train()` and `eval()` methods to customize behavior during training and evaluation.\n\n4. **Dropout-like Layers**:\n   - Other layers that behave like dropout and are designed to regularize models may also change behavior between training and evaluation modes.\n\nWhile there isn't an exhaustive built-in list provided by PyTorch for every possible module affected by `model.eval()` and `model.train()`, you can determine the behavior of any module by inspecting its source code or documentation. If you implement custom layers, you can design them to react to the `self.training` attribute as needed.\n\nFor most typical use cases involving PyTorch\u2019s standard library, focusing on `Dropout` and `BatchNorm` should suffice, unless you're using specialized or custom-built layers."
