        "content": "I'm encountering an issue with Python 2.6.5 and Numpy. I've created a numpy array and assigned it to a variable. When I create a new variable and assign it the same array, and then perform an operation to the new array, the original array's values also get changed. Why is this happening? Here's the code I've used:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\na = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])\nb = a\nc = a\nc[:,1] = c[:,1] + 5\n```\n\nAfter running this, the values of arrays 'a', 'b' and 'c' are all changed to: \n\n```python\narray([[1, 7],\n       [3, 9]])\n```\n\nI'm relatively new to Python and programming in general, so any help would be appreciated."

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is due to how variable assignment works with mutable objects like numpy arrays in Python. When you assign one variable to another, like `b = a` or `c = a`, you're not creating a new, independent copy of the object. Instead, both `b` and `c` end up referencing the same underlying numpy array as `a`. This means that any modifications to the array through `b` or `c` will also affect `a`, since they are all pointing to the same data in memory.\n\nTo create an independent copy of the array that you can modify without affecting the original, you need to use the `copy` method provided by numpy. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\na = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])\nb = a.copy()  # Create a new independent copy of the array\nc = a.copy()  # Create another independent copy of the array\nc[:,1] = c[:,1] + 5\n```\n\nWith this change, modifying `c` will not affect `a` or `b`. After running the modified code, `a` and `b` will remain as:\n\n```python\narray([[1, 2],\n       [3, 4]])\n```\n\nAnd `c` will be:\n\n```python\narray([[1, 7],\n       [3, 9]])\n```\n\nUsing the `copy` method ensures that each variable has its own separate copy of the data, allowing you to modify them independently."
