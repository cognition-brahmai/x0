        "content": "You can execute a shell script from within your Python code using several methods. Here are a few common approaches:\n\n1. **Using the `subprocess` module**: This is the most recommended way as it provides more control over how you interact with the shell script.\n\n   ```python\n   import subprocess\n\n   # Using subprocess.run (Python 3.5+)\n   result = subprocess.run(['./your_script.sh'], capture_output=True, text=True)\n   print(result.stdout)  # To get the standard output\n   print(result.stderr)  # To get the error output\n\n   # Using subprocess.call\n   return_code = subprocess.call(['./your_script.sh'])\n   print(return_code)\n   ```\n\n2. **Using the `os.system` function**: This is a simpler approach but offers less control and doesn't capture the output.\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n\n   return_code = os.system('./your_script.sh')\n   print(return_code)\n   ```\n\n3. **Using the `os.popen` function**: This captures the output but is less flexible compared to `subprocess`.\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n\n   with os.popen('./your_script.sh') as stream:\n       output = stream.read()\n   print(output)\n   ```\n\n4. **Using the `sh` module**: This is an external library that provides a more Pythonic interface to shell commands.\n\n   ```python\n   import sh\n\n   # Assuming you have installed the `sh` module via pip\n   output = sh.your_script()\n   print(output)\n   ```\n\nMake sure that your shell script has the executable permission. You can set it using the command `chmod +x your_script.sh`.\n\nChoose the method that best fits your needs based on how much control and feedback you require from executing the script."
