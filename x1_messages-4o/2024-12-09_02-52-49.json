Although 'django_extensions' is added to my INSTALLED_APPS in my Django project, running 'python manage.py help' does not show any django-extension commands and the 'graph_models' command returns an 'Unknown command' error. How can I make these commands available?"

        "content": "To ensure that Django Extensions and the associated graph visualization tools are properly installed and configured, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Verify Installation:**\n   First, ensure that `django-extensions`, `graphviz`, and `pygraphviz` are installed in your virtual environment. You can check this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip list\n   ```\n\n   If any of these packages are missing, you can install them with:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install django-extensions graphviz pygraphviz\n   ```\n\n2. **Check INSTALLED_APPS:**\n   Make sure that `'django_extensions'` is correctly listed in the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting of your Django project's `settings.py` file:\n\n   ```python\n   INSTALLED_APPS = [\n       # other apps\n       'django_extensions',\n   ]\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify Graphviz Installation:**\n   Ensure that Graphviz is installed correctly on your system. You can verify the installation by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   dot -V\n   ```\n\n   This command should display the version of Graphviz installed.\n\n   If it is not installed, you can install Graphviz using:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install graphviz\n   ```\n\n4. **Check PATH and PYTHONPATH:**\n   Ensure that your environment's PATH and PYTHONPATH are set correctly so that the Python interpreter can find the installed packages. You can check this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   echo $PATH\n   echo $PYTHONPATH\n   ```\n\n   If necessary, adjust these paths in your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, or equivalent shell configuration file, and then reload the configuration with `source ~/.bashrc`.\n\n5. **Check for Errors in Project:**\n   Ensure there are no syntax errors or other issues in your Django project that could prevent management commands from running correctly.\n\n6. **Restart the Virtual Environment:**\n   Sometimes, changes do not take effect until you deactivate and then reactivate your virtual environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   deactivate\n   source venv/bin/activate  # replace 'venv' with your virtual environment name\n   ```\n\n7. **Try Running the Command Again:**\n   After verifying all the above steps, try running the command again:\n\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py help\n   python manage.py graph_models\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and have the `django-extensions` commands available in your Django project. If you're still experiencing issues, it may be helpful to check for any additional error messages or logs that could provide more insight."
