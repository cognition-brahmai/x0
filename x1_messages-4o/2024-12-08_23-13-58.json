Each armchair has a unique combination of color and pattern, and no two armchairs have the same combination. \nTo make it even more challenging, you will need to use logical reasoning to determine the correct answers. Good luck!\n| Armchair Number | Color | Pattern |\n|----------------|-------|---------|\n| 1              | Red   | Dots    |\n| 2              | Blue  | Stripes |\n| 3              | Green | Dots    |\n| 4              | Yellow| Stripes |\n| 5              | Purple| Checks  |\nClues: \n1. The armchair with a red cushion has dots on the fabric.\n2. The armchair with a blue cushion does not have checks on the fabric.\n3. The armchair with a green cushion has dots on the fabric.\n4.

From clue 1, we know that the armchair with a red cushion has dots, which matches Armchair 1.\n2. From clue 3, we know that the armchair with a green cushion also has dots, which matches Armchair 3.\n3. From clue 2, the armchair with a blue cushion does not have checks. Armchair 2 has stripes, so it matches.\n4. Clue 4 states that the armchair with a yellow cushion is not striped. Since Armchair 4 is listed as having stripes, it must not have a yellow cushion.\n5. Clue 5 states that the armchair with a purple cushion is not dotted, which matches Armchair 5 having checks.\n\nBased on these deductions, let's assign the correct color and pattern:\n\n- Armchair 1: Red, Dots\n- Armchair 2: Blue, Stripes\n- Armchair 3: Green, Dots\n- Armchair 4: Yellow, (since it cannot be striped, it must be Checks)\n- Armchair 5: Purple, Checks\n\nNow we can conclude:\n- Armchair 1 has a Red cushion with Dots.\n- Armchair 2 has a Blue cushion with Stripes.\n- Armchair 3 has a Green cushion with Dots.\n- Armchair 4 has a Yellow cushion with Checks.\n- Armchair 5 has a Purple cushion with Checks."
