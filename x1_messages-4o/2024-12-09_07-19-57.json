Why am I getting this TypeError and why does changing the class declaration fix it?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to the way classes are handled in Python 2.x. In Python 2, there are two types of classes: old-style classes and new-style classes.\n\n1. **Old-style classes** are those that do not inherit from `object`. They are defined simply as `class X:`. In your original code, `class X:` is an old-style class.\n\n2. **New-style classes** are those that inherit from `object`. They are defined as `class X(object):`. In Python 3, all classes are new-style classes by default, but this is not the case in Python 2.\n\nThe `super()` function in Python is used to call methods from a parent class, but it only works properly with new-style classes. When you try to use `super()` with an old-style class, it raises a `TypeError` because `super()` expects the first argument to be a type, which only new-style classes are.\n\nBy changing the declaration of `class X` to `class X(object)`, you are making it a new-style class, which allows `super()` to function as expected. This is why modifying the class declaration resolves the error.\n\nIn summary, to fix this TypeError in Python 2.5, ensure that all classes in the inheritance chain inherit from `object`, thereby making them new-style classes. This way, `super()` can be used without issues."
