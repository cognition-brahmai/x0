These models are trained on extensive datasets and can generate coherent text based on the input provided.\n\nGiven the sentence: \"After the cat finished its playful sprint, it jumped onto the fence and began grooming itself, enjoying the warm sun on its fur.\"\n\nThe model might predict a sentence like: \"Soon, it spotted a bird in the distance and its curiosity was piqued, leading it to watch intently from its perch.\" \n\nThis prediction considers the context of the cat's behavior and the environment described in the initial sentence."
