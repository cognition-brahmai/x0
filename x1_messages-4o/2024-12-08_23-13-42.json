Here's a basic example:\n\nIf you want to replace the word \"cat\" with \"dog,\" the command would be:\n\nFind: \"cat\"\nReplace with: \"dog\"\n\nThe new sentence would be: \"The dog sat on the mat.\"\n\nIf you're using a text editor or word processor, you can usually access the Find/Replace function through the Edit menu or by pressing Ctrl+H (Cmd+H on Mac). Then, input the word or phrase you want to find and the word or phrase you want to replace it with, and execute the command to make the changes."
