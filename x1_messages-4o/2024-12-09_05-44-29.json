However, when I try to generate a project from Intellij, selecting Python module, I am unable to find Django facet in the technology part. I have already installed Python and the related Django on my machine prior to setting up the plugin. I've searched the web but found no solution or even any related question. How do I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "To resolve the issue of not finding the Django facet in IntelliJ IDEA, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Verify Plugin Installation**:\n   - Ensure that you have the Python plugin installed correctly. Go to `File > Settings > Plugins` and check if the Python plugin is enabled. If not, enable it and restart IntelliJ IDEA.\n\n2. **Check Django Installation**:\n   - Make sure Django is installed in your Python environment. You can check this by running `pip show django` or `pip list` in your terminal. If it's not installed, you can install it using `pip install django`.\n\n3. **Configure Python SDK**:\n   - Go to `File > Project Structure > SDKs` and ensure you have set the correct Python SDK where Django is installed. If not, add a new SDK pointing to your Python interpreter.\n\n4. **Create Django Project**:\n   - Instead of adding a Django facet to a Python module, consider creating a Django project directly. Go to `File > New > Project`, select `Django` from the left-hand menu, and configure the project settings accordingly.\n\n5. **Update IntelliJ IDEA**:\n   - Since you're using an older version of IntelliJ IDEA (13.1), consider updating to a more recent version if possible, as newer versions come with better support and features for Django development.\n\n6. **Check Facet Configuration**:\n   - If you still wish to add a Django facet, go to `File > Project Structure > Modules`, select your Python module, and try adding a new facet. If Django isn't listed, it might be due to the version or the plugin configuration.\n\n7. **Reinstall Python Plugin**:\n   - Sometimes, reinstalling the plugin can resolve such issues. Disable and then re-enable the Python plugin, or uninstall and reinstall it.\n\n8. **IDE Logs**:\n   - Check the IDE logs for any errors or warnings that might indicate why the Django facet is not appearing. You can view logs under `Help > Show Log in Explorer/Finder`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to configure Django support within your IntelliJ IDEA setup. If the issue persists, consider reaching out to JetBrains support for more assistance."
