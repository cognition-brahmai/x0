I'm facing a problem that the pattern `r'PY (\\d\\d\\d\\d)'` appears elsewhere in the data causing false positive results. I tried using `^` to match the pattern at the beginning of a line, however, `r'^PY (\\d\\d\\d\\d)'` doesn't provide the desired results. I also tried using `\\n` which seems to work but may lead to complications. Here's the code I'm currently using:\n\n```python\nimport re\nf = open('savedrecs.txt')\nwosrecords = f.read()\n\ndef findyears():\n    result = re.findall(r'PY (\\d\\d\\d\\d)', wosrecords)\n    print result\n\nfindyears()\n```\nThe line for \"Publication Year\" looks like this (at the very beginning of a line): `PY 2015`."

        "content": "To accurately extract publication years from lines starting with `PY` in your ISI-style data, using the newline character `\\n` can indeed be a helpful approach. However, to make it more robust and handle potential variations in how lines might be structured, you can combine it with the `re.MULTILINE` flag. This approach ensures that the caret `^` matches the start of each line within your string.\n\nHere's how you can adjust your code:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef find_years(file_path):\n    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:\n        wosrecords = f.read()\n\n    # Use re.MULTILINE to ensure ^ matches the start of each line\n    pattern = r'^PY (\\d{4})'\n    result = re.findall(pattern, wosrecords, re.MULTILINE)\n    \n    # Print the result\n    print(result)\n\n# Call the function with your file path\nfind_years('savedrecs.txt')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`re.MULTILINE` Flag**: This flag allows `^` to match the start of each line (after every newline `\\n`), not just the start of the entire string.\n\n2. **Regex Pattern `^PY (\\d{4})`**:\n   - `^PY`: Matches lines starting with `PY`.\n   - `(\\d{4})`: Captures exactly four digits, which is typical for a year.\n\n3. **Reading File**: Using `with open(...)` ensures that the file is properly closed after reading.\n\n4. **Function Parameter**: The function now takes `file_path` as an argument, making it more reusable.\n\nThis solution should accurately extract the publication years by focusing only on lines that exactly start with `PY`."
