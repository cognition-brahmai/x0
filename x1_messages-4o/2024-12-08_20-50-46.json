First, perform the multiplication: \\(7 \\times 2 = 14\\).\n2. Next, perform the division: \\(\\frac{5}{10} = 0.5\\).\n3. Now, substitute these values back into the expression: \\(3 + 14 - 0.5\\).\n4. Perform the addition: \\(3 + 14 = 17\\).\n5. Finally, perform the subtraction: \\(17 - 0.5 = 16.5\\).\n\nSo, \\(3 + 7 \\times 2 - 5 / 10 = 16.5\\)."
