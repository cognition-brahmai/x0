It appears that `scipy` once provided this function as evident here: http://projects.scipy.org/scipy/browser/trunk/scipy/stats/models/utils.py?rev=3473. However, I am unable to locate it in the current versions. I would prefer to use `scipy`'s version instead of copying the old code from the repository. Has the function been replaced or removed? If so, where can I find it?"

        "content": "The `mad` (mean absolute deviation) function was indeed part of older versions of `scipy` but it appears to have been removed in more recent versions. This could be due to various reasons such as code reorganization, deprecation, or the function not being widely used.\n\nIn the current versions of `scipy`, the `mad` function is not available directly. However, you can easily compute the mean absolute deviation using `numpy` or by writing a simple function yourself. Here's an example of how you can do it using `numpy`:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef mad(data, axis=None):\n    return np.mean(np.abs(data - np.mean(data, axis)), axis)\n\n# Example usage:\ndata = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nmad_value = mad(data)\nprint(f\"Mean Absolute Deviation: {mad_value}\")\n```\n\nIf you're looking for a `scipy` alternative, you might consider using other statistical functions available in `scipy.stats`, but for mean absolute deviation specifically, the custom function above or using `numpy` operations is your best bet.\n\nIf you are looking for robust statistical functions, `statsmodels` provides a function for median absolute deviation (`statsmodels.robust.scale.mad`), but that is slightly different from mean absolute deviation."
