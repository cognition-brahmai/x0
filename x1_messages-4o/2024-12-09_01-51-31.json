I am trying to set up SQLAlchemy to clean up orphan entries when some entries are deleted from the tagging table. To do this, I was advised to use 'delete-orphan' in the cascade option in the relationship. However, when I try to implement this, I get an AssertionError: \"This AttributeImpl is not configured to track parents\". I have also tried to use a class method 'Tag.delete_orphans()' to call it every time I think some orphans could occur, but this doesn't seem to be a very elegant solution. Why doesn't my setting with 'delete-orphan' work?\n\nHere is the code:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.associationproxy import association_proxy\nfrom my_flask_project import db\n\ntagging = db.Table('tagging',\n    db.Column('tag_id', db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('tag.id', ondelete='cascade'), primary_key=True),\n    db.Column('role_id', db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('role.id', ondelete='cascade'), primary_key=True)\n)\n\nclass Tag(db.Model):\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n    name = db.Column(db.String(100), unique=True, nullable=False)\n\n    def __init__(self, name=None):\n        self.name = name\n\n    @classmethod\n    def delete_orphans(cls):\n        for tag in Tag.query.outerjoin(tagging).filter(tagging.c.role_id == None):\n            db.session.delete(tag)\n\nclass Role(db.Model):\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n    user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id', ondelete='cascade'))\n    user = db.relationship('User', backref=db.backref('roles', cascade='all', lazy='dynamic'))\n    ...\n    tags = db.relationship('Tag', secondary=tagging, cascade='all', backref=db.backref('roles', cascade='all'))\n    tag_names = association_proxy('tags', 'name')\n\n    __table_args__ = (\n        db.UniqueConstraint('user_id', 'check_id'),\n    )\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to the use of the `delete-orphan` cascade option in conjunction with a many-to-many relationship, which isn't directly supported in SQLAlchemy. The `delete-orphan` cascade is designed to work with one-to-many relationships, where there is a clear parent-child relationship. In a many-to-many setup, the association table complicates this, as neither side is the definitive parent.\n\nHere's a breakdown of possible solutions and improvements:\n\n### 1. Use a Secondary Relationship\n\nYour current setup uses a secondary table (`tagging`) for the many-to-many relationship between `Tag` and `Role`. The `delete-orphan` cascade won't work here because `Tag` and `Role` are peers rather than having a parent-child relationship.\n\n### 2. Custom Logic for Deleting Orphans\n\nGiven that `delete-orphan` won't work out of the box, you can implement custom logic to delete orphaned tags. You already have a class method `delete_orphans` in your `Tag` class. While it may not seem elegant, it's a practical solution. You can hook this method into the lifecycle of your application, such as calling it after certain operations.\n\n### 3. Use Event Listeners\n\nSQLAlchemy supports event listeners that can be used to hook into certain actions, like after a delete. Here's a way to use event listeners to clean up orphaned tags:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import event\n\n@event.listens_for(db.session, 'after_flush')\ndef delete_orphans(session, context):\n    session.query(Tag).filter(~Tag.roles.any()).delete(synchronize_session=False)\n```\n\nThis listener will remove tags that are no longer associated with any roles after each flush operation. Note that `synchronize_session` is set to `False` to bypass session synchronization, which is generally safe for this kind of operation.\n\n### 4. Ensure Foreign Key Constraints\n\nEnsure your foreign keys are set to `ON DELETE CASCADE` to maintain integrity when roles are deleted, but remember this won't handle orphaned tags automatically.\n\n### 5. Manual Cleanup\n\nAs a last resort, manual cleanup via scheduled tasks or scripts might be necessary, depending on how complex your application's logic gets.\n\n### Final Note\n\nEnsure you thoroughly test any approach you choose to ensure it fits your application's needs and doesn't inadvertently delete necessary data. The choice between these solutions largely depends on your specific requirements and how often orphaned tags might occur."
