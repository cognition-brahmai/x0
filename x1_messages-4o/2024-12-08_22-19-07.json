        "content": "You've got the right idea for separating positive and negative numbers from an array in JavaScript. Your code effectively iterates through the array and sorts the numbers into `positiveArr` and `negativeArr`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: You've initialized the original array `arr` and two empty arrays `positiveArr` and `negativeArr`.\n\n2. **Iteration**: You loop through each element in `arr` using a `for` loop.\n\n3. **Condition Check**:\n   - If the current element is greater than 0 (`arr[i] > 0`), it is pushed into `positiveArr`.\n   - If the current element is less than 0 (`arr[i] < 0`), it is pushed into `negativeArr`.\n   - The code does not do anything with zeros, so they are simply ignored and not added to either array.\n\n4. **Output**: Finally, the two arrays, `positiveArr` and `negativeArr`, are printed to the console, displaying the separated positive and negative numbers.\n\nYour code will output:\n\n```\nPositive numbers:  [ 2, 6 ]\nNegative numbers:  [ -3, -7 ]\n```\n\nThis implementation is efficient for the given task.
