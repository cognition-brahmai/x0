        "content": "To determine and display the name of the Bash script file from within the script itself, you can use the special variable `$0`. This variable holds the name of the script as it was invoked. Here's an example of how you can use it in your script:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Extract the script name from $0\nscript_name=$(basename \"$0\")\n\n# Display the message with the script name\necho \"You are running $script_name\"\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n- `$0`: This variable contains the name of the script as it was called.\n- `basename \"$0\"`: The `basename` command is used to extract the filename from a path. This will give you just the script name without any directory path.\n\nWhen you run this script, it will output the message with the correct script name, like \"You are running runme.sh\"."
