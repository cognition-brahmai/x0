A `timedelta` object represents a duration, which can be added to a `datetime` object to get a new `datetime`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\n# Suppose date and time are given as strings\ndate = \"2023-10-30\"\ntime = \"14:30:00.000\"\n\n# Convert the strings to a datetime object\nfulldate = datetime.datetime.strptime(date + ' ' + time, \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f\")\n\n# Specify the number of milliseconds you want to add\nN = 500  # for example, 500 milliseconds\n\n# Create a timedelta object with N milliseconds\ndelta = datetime.timedelta(milliseconds=N)\n\n# Add the timedelta to the original datetime\nnew_fulldate = fulldate + delta\n\nprint(\"Original datetime:\", fulldate)\nprint(\"New datetime after adding N milliseconds:\", new_fulldate)\n```\n\nIn this example, `new_fulldate` will be the original `fulldate` incremented by N milliseconds, where N is the number of milliseconds you want to add. You can adjust the value of N as needed."
