In my current implementation, I am facing a \"RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object.\" I am trying to understand why the `object.__getattribute__` method works. Where does the `object` get the `__getattribute__` method from? If `object` does not have any `__getattribute__`, then we are just calling the same method on class `C` but via the superclass. Why does calling the method via superclass not result in an infinite loop?\n\nHere is the code for reference:\n\n```python\nclass A:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.x = 100\n\n    def __getattribute__(self, x):\n        return self.x\n\na = A()\na.x    # infinite loop\n# RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object\n\nclass B:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.x = 100\n\n    def __getattribute__(self, x):\n        return self.__dict__[x]\n\nb = B()\nb.x    # infinite loop\n# RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object\n\nclass C:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.x = 100\n\n    def __getattribute__(self, x):\n        # 1. error\n        # AttributeError: type object 'object' has no attribute '__getattr__'\n        # return object.__getattr__(self, x)\n        \n        # 2. works\n        return object.__getattribute__(self, x)\n        \n        # 3. works too\n        # return super().__getattribute__(x)\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with infinite loops in your `__getattribute__` method is due to the way attribute access works in Python. When you define a custom `__getattribute__` method, it intercepts *all* attribute accesses for that instance. If you directly access an attribute within `__getattribute__`, like `self.x`, it will recursively call `__getattribute__` again, leading to a potential infinite loop.\n\n### Avoiding Infinite Loops\n\nTo avoid infinite loops, you must use the base class method to access the attribute. This bypasses your overridden method and prevents recursion. The `object.__getattribute__` method is a built-in method in Python's `object` class that allows you to access attributes directly without invoking your custom logic.\n\nHere's how you can fix the issues in your code:\n\n1. **Using `object.__getattribute__`:**\n\n   When you call `object.__getattribute__(self, x)`, you're explicitly telling Python to use the default attribute access mechanism provided by the base `object` class. This method does not call your overridden `__getattribute__`, thus avoiding recursion.\n\n2. **Using `super().__getattribute__`:**\n\n   Similarly, `super().__getattribute__(x)` calls the `__getattribute__` method of the superclass, which, in this case, is the same as calling `object.__getattribute__` because `object` is the ultimate base class for all new-style classes in Python 3.\n\n### Explanation of Code Behavior\n\n- In the first class `A`, the line `return self.x` triggers another call to `__getattribute__`, leading to infinite recursion because it keeps trying to access `self.x` through the custom method.\n\n- In the second class `B`, `return self.__dict__[x]` avoids recursion because it accesses the attribute directly from the instance's dictionary, not through attribute access (which would invoke `__getattribute__`).\n\n- In class `C`, both `object.__getattribute__(self, x)` and `super().__getattribute__(x)` work because they bypass the custom `__getattribute__` and directly use the method provided by the `object` class.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, to avoid infinite loops when overriding `__getattribute__`, you should use `object.__getattribute__` or `super().__getattribute__` to access the attributes safely. This ensures that you are not inadvertently calling your custom method again, thus preventing recursion."
