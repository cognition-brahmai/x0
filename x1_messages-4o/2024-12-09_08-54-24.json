        "content": "To retrieve the monthly sales volume for each company using SQL, you would typically use the `GROUP BY` clause along with aggregate functions like `SUM()` to calculate the total sales volume for each company per month. Assuming you have a table named `sales` with columns `company_id`, `sale_date`, and `sale_amount`, here's an example query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    company_id,\n    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) AS sale_year,\n    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS sale_month,\n    SUM(sale_amount) AS monthly_sales_volume\nFROM \n    sales\nGROUP BY \n    company_id,\n    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date),\n    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date)\nORDER BY \n    company_id,\n    sale_year,\n    sale_month;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date)** and **EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date)**: These functions are used to get the year and month from the `sale_date` column.\n\n- **SUM(sale_amount)**: This function sums up the sales amount for each company for each month.\n\n- **GROUP BY**: This clause groups the results by `company_id`, year, and month.\n\n- **ORDER BY**: This clause orders the results by company, year, and month, making it easier to read the monthly sales volume for each company.\n\nYou may need to adjust this query depending on your database system (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) and the actual structure of your tables."
