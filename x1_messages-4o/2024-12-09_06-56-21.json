Here's how you can achieve the same result:\n\n```bash\nfoo=\"Hello\"\nfoo+=\" World\"\n```\n\nAfter executing the above commands, the variable `foo` will contain the string `\"Hello World\"`.\n\nAnother common way to concatenate strings in Bash is by simply placing the variables next to each other:\n\n```bash\nfoo=\"Hello\"\nfoo=\"$foo World\"\n```\n\nThis also results in the variable `foo` holding the value `\"Hello World\"`. Both methods are widely used in Bash scripting for string concatenation."
