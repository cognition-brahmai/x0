        "content": "To generate unique questions related to nuclear physics using Java, you'll need to utilize a combination of predefined templates and random selection of subatomic particles and nuclear reactions. Here's a basic approach using Java to automate this process:\n\n1. Define lists of subatomic particles, nuclear reactions, and possible applications.\n2. Use random selection to fill in the templates with these elements.\n3. Ensure that each question covers both theoretical and practical aspects.\n\nBelow is a simple Java code snippet to give you an idea of how this could be implemented:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.Random;\n\npublic class NuclearPhysicsQuestionGenerator {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Define lists of components\n        String[] particles = {\"proton\", \"neutron\", \"electron\", \"positron\", \"neutrino\"};\n        String[] reactions = {\"fusion\", \"fission\", \"decay\", \"capture\"};\n        String[] applications = {\"power generation\", \"medical imaging\", \"nuclear weapons\", \"radiation therapy\"};\n\n        // Generate questions\n        List<String> questions = generateQuestions(particles, reactions, applications, 5);\n\n        // Print questions\n        for (int i = 0; i < questions.size(); i++) {\n            System.out.println(\"Question \" + (i + 1) + \": \" + questions.get(i));\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static List<String> generateQuestions(String[] particles, String[] reactions, String[] applications, int numberOfQuestions) {\n        List<String> questions = new ArrayList<>();\n        Random random = new Random();\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < numberOfQuestions; i++) {\n            // Randomly select two different particles\n            String particle1 = particles[random.nextInt(particles.length)];\n            String particle2;\n            do {\n                particle2 = particles[random.nextInt(particles.length)];\n            } while (particle1.equals(particle2));\n\n            // Randomly select a reaction and application\n            String reaction = reactions[random.nextInt(reactions.length)];\n            String application = applications[random.nextInt(applications.length)];\n\n            // Create a question template\n            String question = String.format(\"Discuss the %s reaction involving %s and %s. Explain its theoretical basis and practical applications in %s.\", \n                                             reaction, particle1, particle2, application);\n\n            questions.add(question);\n        }\n\n        return questions;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Particles and Reactions**: The code starts by defining arrays for particles, reactions, and applications.\n- **Random Selection**: It randomly selects two different particles, a reaction, and an application for each question.\n- **Question Template**: A question template is used to ensure each question addresses both theoretical and practical aspects.\n- **Uniqueness**: By using random selection and ensuring different particles are selected, the questions should remain unique.\n\nThis code provides a basic structure and can be expanded with more complex logic and additional elements to create more sophisticated and varied questions."
