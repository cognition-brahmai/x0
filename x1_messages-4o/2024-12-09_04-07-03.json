        "content": "The error message you are seeing is related to how Python's import system works and specifically how the `unittest` framework is trying to discover and import test modules.\n\n### What the Error Means:\n\n1. **Module Import Path**: The error indicates that the `tests` module is being imported from `FOO/exports/tests`, but it is expected to be found in `FOO/exports`. This suggests that there is a mismatch between where the `unittest` discovery process thinks the module should be and where it actually is.\n\n2. **Potential Reasons**:\n   - **Directory Structure**: Your directory structure might not be set up correctly, leading to incorrect import paths. The `unittest` discovery process expects a certain directory structure, and if your test files are not in the expected location, it can lead to this error.\n   - **Module Naming**: There might be an issue with how the Python packages and modules are named or organized. If there are naming conflicts or if the test module is not properly set up as a package, imports can fail.\n   - **Python Path Issues**: There could be an issue with your Python path settings, leading to the interpreter looking for modules in the wrong locations.\n\n### How to Resolve the Issue:\n\n1. **Check Directory Structure**:\n   - Ensure that your `tests` directory is correctly placed within the `FOO/exports` directory.\n   - Verify that `__init__.py` files exist in any directories you want Python to recognize as packages (this applies to Python versions below 3.3).\n\n2. **Check for Naming Conflicts**:\n   - Ensure there are no conflicting module or package names that might cause the import system to get confused.\n\n3. **Update PYTHONPATH**:\n   - Make sure your PYTHONPATH includes the directory where your `FOO/exports` is located. This can be done by setting the environment variable or by modifying `sys.path` in your script.\n\n4. **Use Absolute Imports**:\n   - If you are using relative imports within your tests, try converting them to absolute imports to ensure Python can resolve the module paths correctly.\n\n5. **Run Tests with a Specific Pattern**:\n   - Use the `discover` method of `unittest` with a specific pattern to ensure it only picks up the test files you want. This can help avoid accidental imports from unintended files.\n\n6. **Check for Global Installations**:\n   - Ensure that there isn't a globally installed module with the same name that might be interfering with your imports.\n\nBy checking these areas, you should be able to resolve the import error and run your tests successfully. If the problem persists, reviewing the complete directory structure and comparing it with a fresh project setup might also help in identifying discrepancies."
