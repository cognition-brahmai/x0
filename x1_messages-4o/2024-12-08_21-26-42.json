Your goal is to make the code as efficient as possible. \nCreate a function that takes in two parameters: the proposal status and the recipient's name. If the proposal is rejected, the function should return the message \"Dear [recipient's name], unfortunately your proposal has been rejected.\" If the proposal is accepted, the function should return the message \"Dear [recipient's name], congratulations on your successful proposal.\" \nHowever, you are only allowed to use one if statement and one return statement in your code. How can you achieve this goal while still maintaining the same functionality?"

        "content": "To achieve this functionality with only one `if` statement and one `return` statement, you can use a ternary-like approach in Python to determine which message to return based on the proposal status. Here is how you can implement the function:\n\n```python\ndef generate_message(proposal_status, recipient_name):\n    message = (\n        f\"Dear {recipient_name}, congratulations on your successful proposal.\"\n        if proposal_status == \"accepted\"\n        else f\"Dear {recipient_name}, unfortunately your proposal has been rejected.\"\n    )\n    return message\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(generate_message(\"accepted\", \"John\"))   # Output: Dear John, congratulations on your successful proposal.\nprint(generate_message(\"rejected\", \"Jane\"))   # Output: Dear Jane, unfortunately your proposal has been rejected.\n```\n\nIn this code, the ternary conditional operator is used within the assignment to the `message` variable. It efficiently checks the `proposal_status` and assigns the appropriate message, which is then returned in a single `return` statement."
