I followed the instructions from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OpenCV and the installation seemed to run properly without any errors. However, when I try to run a sample Python script, I encounter an error saying \"ImportError: No module named cv2.cv\". I suspect this might be a path issue as the OpenCV installed to the current directory I was in when I ran the install script, a subdirectory of my home folder. I tried adding the suggested code to add '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages' to my system path but it didn't help. I also don't see any files in the \"site-packages\" directory. Should I have installed OpenCV in that directory instead? How can I solve this issue and get a usable install of OpenCV?"

        "content": "It sounds like you are facing a common issue related to the installation path and module path configuration for OpenCV on Ubuntu. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help resolve the problem and ensure OpenCV is correctly installed and accessible for Python 2.x:\n\n1. **Verify Installation Paths:**\n   First, check if OpenCV installed correctly and where the Python bindings are located. Typically, the installation should place the cv2.so file in the `site-packages` directory of your Python environment. You can search for it using:\n   ```bash\n   find /usr/local/lib/ -name \"cv2*.so\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Updating the Python Path:**\n   Once you find the location of the `cv2.so` file, you need to ensure that this directory is in your Python path. You can add it to your Python environment by including the following lines in your script or your `.bashrc` file:\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   sys.path.append('/path/to/cv2.so/directory')\n   ```\n\n3. **Reinstall OpenCV with Correct Paths:**\n   If you couldn\u2019t find the `cv2.so` file, you might need to reinstall OpenCV. Here\u2019s a brief guide to ensure correct installation:\n\n   ```bash\n   # Install dependencies\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake git pkg-config\n   sudo apt-get install libjpeg8-dev libtiff5-dev libjasper-dev libpng12-dev\n\n   # Video I/O packages\n   sudo apt-get install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libv4l-dev\n   sudo apt-get install libxvidcore-dev libx264-dev\n\n   # OpenCV dependencies\n   sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev libatlas-base-dev gfortran\n\n   # Download OpenCV\n   cd ~\n   git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git\n   cd opencv\n   git checkout 3.4.0\n\n   # Create build directory\n   mkdir build\n   cd build\n\n   # Configure the build with Python support\n   cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE \\\n         -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \\\n         -D INSTALL_PYTHON_EXAMPLES=ON \\\n         -D OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=~/opencv_contrib/modules \\\n         -D BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON ..\n\n   # Compile and install\n   make -j4\n   sudo make install\n   sudo ldconfig\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify Installation:**\n   To verify the installation, run Python and try importing OpenCV:\n   ```python\n   python\n   >>> import cv2\n   >>> print(cv2.__version__)\n   ```\n\n5. **Environment Variables:**\n   If the above steps do not resolve the issue, you can also try setting the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to include the directory where `cv2.so` is located:\n   ```bash\n   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/cv2.so/directory\n   ```\n\n6. **Consider Upgrading:**\n   Ubuntu 14.04 is an older release, and Python 2.x is no longer supported. If possible, consider upgrading your system and Python version to ensure better support and security.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the ImportError and successfully use OpenCV with Python 2.x on Ubuntu 14.04."
