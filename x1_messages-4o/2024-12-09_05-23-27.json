        "content": "Yes, you can list the dependencies or requirements of a pip package without actually installing it by using the `pip` command with the `--dry-run` and `--ignore-installed` options. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```bash\npip install <package-name> --dry-run --ignore-installed\n```\n\nThis command will simulate the installation process and display the packages that would be installed, along with their versions, without actually installing them.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the `pipdeptree` tool to visualize the dependency tree of a package. First, you need to install `pipdeptree` if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install pipdeptree\n```\n\nThen, you can use it to check the dependencies of a specific package:\n\n```bash\npipdeptree --package <package-name>\n```\n\nThis will give you a tree view of the package's dependencies. Note that `pipdeptree` checks installed packages, so it\u2019s more useful for understanding dependencies of packages that are already in your environment. For checking dependencies before installation, the `--dry-run` option with `pip` is the best choice."
