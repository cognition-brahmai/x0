I have created a python Controller for gravity and FPSController orientation. However, I am facing issues as it only works until any angle goes over 180 degrees and then it appears discontinuous. I believe this is due to the discontinuity of rotation_difference. I am looking for a more elegant way to achieve that the local Z orientation is continuously mouse-dependent, while local X and Y orientations depend continuously on some given vector. Can you provide any insights or solutions?\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    print(\"Started\")\n\n    controller = bge.logic.getCurrentController()\n    me = controller.owner\n\n    distance, loc, glob = me.getVectTo((0,0,0))\n\n    grav = controller.actuators['Gravity']\n\n    strength = me['Gravity']\n    force = strength*(distance*distance)*glob\n\n    grav.force = force\n\n    try:\n        rot = Vector((0,0,-1)).rotation_difference(glob).to_matrix()\n    except Exception as E:\n        print(E)\n        rot = (0,0,0)\n\n    rotZ = me.orientation\n    me.orientation = rot*rotZ\n\n    controller.activate(grav)\n\nmain()\n```"

        "content": "When dealing with 3D rotations, especially for smooth and continuous transitions, it's important to work with representations that handle the discontinuities of angles effectively. Using quaternions instead of Euler angles or matrices can help address issues like gimbal lock and discontinuities that occur when angles exceed 180 degrees.\n\nIn your current setup, you're using `rotation_difference`, which can lead to discontinuities when the angle difference crosses 180 degrees. To maintain a continuous orientation, you can perform the following adjustments:\n\n1. **Use Quaternions for Rotation**: Quaternions are well-suited for smooth interpolations and continuous rotations, avoiding the pitfalls of Euler angles.\n\n2. **Interpolate Rotations**: Use spherical linear interpolation (slerp) to smoothly interpolate between orientations.\n\nHere's a revised version of your script using quaternions:\n\n```python\nimport bge\nfrom mathutils import Vector, Quaternion\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Started\")\n\n    controller = bge.logic.getCurrentController()\n    me = controller.owner\n\n    # Calculate distance, local direction, and global direction to (0,0,0)\n    distance, loc, glob = me.getVectTo((0, 0, 0))\n    \n    # Gravity actuator\n    grav = controller.actuators['Gravity']\n    \n    # Calculate force based on distance and direction\n    strength = me['Gravity']\n    force = strength * (distance**2) * glob\n    grav.force = force\n    \n    # Desired up direction (away from the sphere's center)\n    desired_up = Vector((0, 0, 1))\n    \n    # Calculate the rotation needed to align the current up direction with the global direction\n    try:\n        current_up = me.getAxisVect((0, 0, 1))\n        rot_quat = current_up.rotation_difference(desired_up)\n        \n        # Interpolate the rotation to avoid abrupt changes\n        rot_quat = rot_quat.slerp(Quaternion(), 0.1)  # Adjust the factor for smoothness\n        \n        # Convert quaternion to matrix and apply it to the current orientation\n        me.orientation = rot_quat.to_matrix().to_3x3() @ me.worldOrientation\n    except Exception as E:\n        print(E)\n    \n    # Activate the gravity actuator\n    controller.activate(grav)\n\nmain()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Quaternions**: The `rotation_difference` method returns a quaternion that represents the rotation needed to align two vectors. Using quaternions for this purpose ensures smooth transitions without discontinuities.\n- **Slerp (Spherical Linear Interpolation)**: This method interpolates between two quaternions, providing smooth transitions. Adjust the interpolation factor (0.1 in this example) to control the smoothness and speed of the transition.\n- **Orientation Update**: Convert the quaternion to a 3x3 rotation matrix and apply it to the object's current orientation.\n\nThis approach should provide a more elegant solution to maintaining continuous local Z orientation based on mouse input while keeping the local X and Y orientations aligned with the given vector."
