Your goal is to incorporate your friend's favorite color and a random number between 1 and 100 in the email subject to make it unique. To accomplish this, you need to create a Python script that utilizes the following variables: [Friend's Name], Party Date, Party Time, and Location. You must follow the email message format, and your email subject should resemble \"Surprise Birthday Party for [Friend's Name] - [Friend's favorite color] and [# between 1-100]\". To make the process more complex, you want to generate a random number between 1 and 1000, but you want to ensure that the number is not divisible by 2 or 5. How can you write a Python code that generates the email subject with these requirements?"

The script will incorporate your friend's name, favorite color, and a random number between 1 and 1000 that is not divisible by 2 or 5. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef generate_random_number():\n    while True:\n        # Generate a random number between 1 and 1000\n        num = random.randint(1, 1000)\n        # Check if the number is not divisible by 2 or 5\n        if num % 2 != 0 and num % 5 != 0:\n            return num\n\ndef create_email_subject(friend_name, favorite_color):\n    random_number = generate_random_number()\n    subject = f\"Surprise Birthday Party for {friend_name} - {favorite_color} and {random_number}\"\n    return subject\n\n# Example usage\nfriend_name = \"Alice\"\nparty_date = \"December 10\"\nparty_time = \"7:00 PM\"\nlocation = \"123 Party Lane\"\nfavorite_color = \"Blue\"\n\nemail_subject = create_email_subject(friend_name, favorite_color)\nprint(email_subject)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Random Number Generation**: The `generate_random_number` function generates a random number between 1 and 1000 and checks if it is not divisible by 2 or 5. If the number meets the criteria, it returns the number.\n\n2. **Email Subject Creation**: The `create_email_subject` function takes the friend's name and favorite color as input, generates a suitable random number using the `generate_random_number` function, and constructs the email subject string.\n\n3. **Example Usage**: You can assign values to `friend_name`, `party_date`, `party_time`, `location`, and `favorite_color` as desired. The script then constructs and prints the email subject.\n\nThis script meets the requirements by ensuring the random number is not divisible by 2 or 5 and includes the friend's name and favorite color in the email subject."
