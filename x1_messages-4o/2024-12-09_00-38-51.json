        "content": "To capture the output of the `print` statements executed within an `exec()` call in Python, you can use the `io` module to redirect the standard output to a `StringIO` object. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport io\nimport sys\n\n# Create a StringIO object to capture the output\noutput_capture = io.StringIO()\n\n# Save the current standard output\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n\n# Redirect standard output to the StringIO object\nsys.stdout = output_capture\n\ntry:\n    code = \"\"\"\ni = [0,1,2]\nfor j in i:\n    print(j)\n\"\"\"\n    # Execute the code\n    exec(code)\nfinally:\n    # Restore the original standard output\n    sys.stdout = original_stdout\n\n# Retrieve the output from the StringIO object\ncaptured_output = output_capture.getvalue()\n\nprint(\"Captured Output:\")\nprint(captured_output)\n```\n\nIn this code, `sys.stdout` is temporarily redirected to an instance of `StringIO`, which captures all the printed output. After executing the `exec()` statement, `sys.stdout` is restored to its original state, and the output captured in the `StringIO` object is retrieved using the `getvalue()` method. This gives you the printed output as a string, which you can then use as needed."
