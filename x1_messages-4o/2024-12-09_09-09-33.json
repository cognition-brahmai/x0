        "content": "To write a Python function that generates a random password with specific requirements, you can use the `random` and `string` modules. Below is an example function that generates a random password with a specified length, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport string\n\ndef generate_password(length=12, include_uppercase=True, include_digits=True, include_special_chars=True):\n    # Create a pool of characters to choose from\n    pool = string.ascii_lowercase  # Always include lowercase letters\n    \n    if include_uppercase:\n        pool += string.ascii_uppercase  # Add uppercase letters if required\n    if include_digits:\n        pool += string.digits  # Add digits if required\n    if include_special_chars:\n        pool += string.punctuation  # Add special characters if required\n\n    # Ensure the pool is not empty\n    if not pool:\n        raise ValueError(\"No character types selected for password generation.\")\n    \n    # Generate the password\n    password = ''.join(random.choices(pool, k=length))\n    return password\n\n# Example usage\nprint(generate_password(16, True, True, True))  # Generates a 16-character password\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Imports**: The `random` module is used to make random choices, and the `string` module provides sets of characters.\n- **Character Pool**: The `pool` variable starts with lowercase letters. Depending on the parameters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters are added to the pool.\n- **Password Generation**: `random.choices()` is used to randomly select characters from the pool to form the password.\n- **Parameters**: \n  - `length`: The desired length of the password.\n  - `include_uppercase`, `include_digits`, `include_special_chars`: Boolean flags to include/exclude character types.\n- **Error Handling**: A `ValueError` is raised if no character types are selected, ensuring there's something to generate the password from.\n\nThis function can be customized further based on additional requirements, such as ensuring at least one character from each selected category is included."
