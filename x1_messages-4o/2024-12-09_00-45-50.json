My expectation is that when an object of this class is used in an 'if' statement, it should return False and therefore print \"False\". However, when I run my code, it prints \"True\". Can anyone explain why this is happening and how to correctly overload the __bool__ method? Here is my current code:\n\n```python\nclass Foo(object):\n  def __bool__(self):\n    return False\n\nf = Foo()\nif f:\n  print \"True\"\nelse:\n  print \"False\"\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the version of Python you're using and the syntax used in your print statements. In Python 2.x, the `__bool__` method is not recognized. Instead, Python 2.x uses the `__nonzero__` method to determine the truthiness of an object. \n\nHere\u2019s how you can modify your code to work correctly in both Python 2.x and Python 3.x:\n\n```python\nclass Foo(object):\n    def __bool__(self):\n        return False\n    \n    def __nonzero__(self):  # For Python 2.x compatibility\n        return self.__bool__()\n\nf = Foo()\nif f:\n    print(\"True\")  # Use parentheses for print function\nelse:\n    print(\"False\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- In Python 3.x, the `__bool__` method is used to determine the truthiness of an object.\n- In Python 2.x, the `__nonzero__` method is used instead.\n- The print statement syntax you provided (`print \"True\"`) is for Python 2.x. In Python 3.x, print is a function and requires parentheses (`print(\"True\")`).\n\nBy using both `__bool__` and `__nonzero__`, your class will be compatible across both Python versions."
