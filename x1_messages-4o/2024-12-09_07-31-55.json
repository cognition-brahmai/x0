I currently have the following code:\n```python\ntry:\n    do_stuff()\nexcept Exception as err:\n    print(Exception, err)\n    # I want to print the entire traceback here,\n    # not just the exception name and details\n```\nI would like to print the entire traceback when an exception is raised, just like it would be printed without the try/except block intercepting the exception. However, I do not want this to cause my program to exit. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To catch and log exceptions in Python without halting the program, and to print the full traceback, you can use the `traceback` module. The `traceback` module provides utilities for extracting, formatting, and printing Python program stack traces. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport traceback\n\ntry:\n    do_stuff()\nexcept Exception as err:\n    # Print the full traceback\n    traceback.print_exc()\n\n    # Alternatively, if you want to log the traceback to a file or another output,\n    # you can capture it as a string and handle it as needed\n    traceback_str = traceback.format_exc()\n    print(traceback_str)  # Or log it using your preferred logging framework\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`traceback.print_exc()`**: This function prints the last exception traceback to `sys.stderr`. It's a simple way to display the full traceback when catching an exception.\n\n- **`traceback.format_exc()`**: This function returns the traceback as a string, which allows you to manipulate or log it as needed. You can print it to the console, save it to a log file, or send it elsewhere.\n\nBy using these methods from the `traceback` module, you can log detailed information about exceptions without causing your program to exit, allowing you to handle exceptions gracefully while maintaining visibility into any issues."
