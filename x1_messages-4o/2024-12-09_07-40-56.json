        "content": "Embedding multiple independent Python interpreters into a C/C++ application, each running on its own thread, is a challenging task due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and its use of global state. However, you've taken some significant steps by moving mutable global variables to a heap-allocated struct and using Thread Local Storage (TLS).\n\nHere are a few suggestions and considerations for improving your approach:\n\n1. **Use of Subinterpreters**: Python supports subinterpreters, which are designed to allow multiple interpreters to run in the same process. Each subinterpreter has its own separate state, but they still share the GIL. You can use the `Py_NewInterpreter` function to create them. While they don't run in parallel due to the GIL, they can be used to isolate the state between different tasks.\n\n2. **MicroPython or PyPy**: Consider using alternative Python implementations like MicroPython or PyPy, which may have different threading and memory management models that better suit your needs.\n\n3. **Refactoring Tools**: There are no specific tools available that automatically convert Python's global state to a heap-allocated struct with TLS. This process typically requires manual refactoring. However, using static analysis tools such as Cppcheck or Clang Static Analyzer can help identify global variables and dependencies in the codebase.\n\n4. **Concurrency Models**: Instead of disabling the GIL and modifying Python's core, consider designing your application around Python's existing concurrency models, such as using multiprocessing with separate processes instead of threads. This approach avoids GIL limitations and provides true parallelism at the cost of higher memory usage and inter-process communication overhead.\n\n5. **Custom Build of Python**: If you continue with your custom build, ensure you maintain this custom version and regularly update it with upstream changes to incorporate security patches and improvements.\n\n6. **Performance Testing**: Rigorously test the performance and stability of your modified interpreter. Disabling the GIL and modifying the interpreter's core can lead to subtle bugs and race conditions, so it's crucial to validate your implementation thoroughly.\n\n7. **Community and Expert Consultation**: Engage with the Python developer community through forums, mailing lists, or conferences to get insights and advice from those who have attempted similar tasks or have deep knowledge of Python's internals.\n\nRemember that while it's technically possible to embed multiple interpreters with independent states, it can lead to complex maintenance and compatibility challenges, especially when dealing with third-party Python modules that may not be designed to run without the GIL."
