However, my result still captures the .pdf despite using the parentheses. I am using Python and my code looks like this:\n\n```python\nimport re\nstring_one = 'file_record_transcript.pdf'\nstring_two = 'file_07241999.pdf'\nstring_three = 'testfile_fake.pdf.tmp'\n\npattern = '^(file.+)\\.pdf$'\na = re.search(pattern, string_one)\nb = re.search(pattern, string_two)\nc = re.search(pattern, string_three)\n\nprint(a.group() if a is not None else 'Not found')\nprint(b.group() if b is not None else 'Not found')\nprint(c.group() if c is not None else 'Not found')\n```\n\nWhen I run this, it returns:\n\n```python\nfile_record_transcript.pdf\nfile_07241999.pdf\nNot found\n```\n\nBut what I want to get is:\n\n```python\nfile_record_transcript\nfile_07241999\nNot found\n```\n\nCould you please help me identify what I am doing wrong?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the way you're using the `group()` method. When you use `group()` without any arguments, it returns the entire match of the regular expression, including the parts outside the capturing groups. In your case, it includes the `.pdf` part as well.\n\nTo solve this, you should use `group(1)` to get the content of the first capturing group, which is what you have inside the parentheses. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nstring_one = 'file_record_transcript.pdf'\nstring_two = 'file_07241999.pdf'\nstring_three = 'testfile_fake.pdf.tmp'\n\npattern = '^(file.+)\\.pdf$'\na = re.search(pattern, string_one)\nb = re.search(pattern, string_two)\nc = re.search(pattern, string_three)\n\n# Use group(1) to capture only the content within the first capturing group\nprint(a.group(1) if a is not None else 'Not found')\nprint(b.group(1) if b is not None else 'Not found')\nprint(c.group(1) if c is not None else 'Not found')\n```\n\nWith this change, your program should output:\n\n```\nfile_record_transcript\nfile_07241999\nNot found\n```\n\nThis is because `group(1)` extracts only the part of the string that matches the content inside the first set of parentheses, which excludes the `.pdf` part."
