I believe it's a simple command like 'scale=linear' in the plot arguments, but I can't get it to work. Here is my sample program:\n\n```python\nimport pylab\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\na = [pow(10, i) for i in range(10)]\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.add_subplot(2, 1, 1)\n\nline, = ax.plot(a, color='blue', lw=2)\npylab.show()\n```"

        "content": "To plot a graph with a logarithmic axis in Matplotlib, you need to set the scale of the axis to 'log'. You can do this by using the `set_yscale` or `set_xscale` method, depending on whether you want the y-axis or the x-axis to be logarithmic. In your sample code, you can modify it to have a logarithmic y-axis as follows:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Example data\na = [pow(10, i) for i in range(10)]\n\n# Create a figure and a subplot\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.add_subplot(2, 1, 1)\n\n# Plot the data\nline, = ax.plot(a, color='blue', lw=2)\n\n# Set the y-axis to logarithmic scale\nax.set_yscale('log')\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this modified code, `ax.set_yscale('log')` sets the y-axis to a logarithmic scale. If you want the x-axis to be logarithmic instead, you can use `ax.set_xscale('log')`. Adjust according to which axis you want to be in the logarithmic scale."
