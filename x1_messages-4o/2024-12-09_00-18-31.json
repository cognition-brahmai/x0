When I use `Base.metadata.create_all(engine)`, it correctly issues a `CREATE TABLE` with the schema name at the front like `CREATE TABLE my_schema.roads (` but Postgresql complains that the schema doesn't exist. Is there a step I need to follow for SQLAlchemy to issue the `CREATE SCHEMA my_schema` or do I need to call this manually?"

        "content": "When using SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL, if you have a model with a `schema` argument, you need to ensure that the schema exists in the database before creating tables. SQLAlchemy does not automatically create schemas for you. Therefore, you will need to create the schema manually before calling `Base.metadata.create_all(engine)`. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Manually Create the Schema**: You can execute a raw SQL command to create the schema before creating the tables. Here\u2019s an example using SQLAlchemy:\n\n   ```python\n   from sqlalchemy import create_engine, text\n\n   # Replace with your actual database URL\n   engine = create_engine('postgresql://user:password@localhost/mydatabase')\n\n   # Ensure the schema exists\n   with engine.connect() as connection:\n       connection.execute(text(\"CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS my_schema\"))\n\n   # Now create tables\n   Base.metadata.create_all(engine)\n   ```\n\n2. **Use SQLAlchemy to Check and Create**: You can also include checks in your application logic to ensure that the schema exists before proceeding with table creation. This can be useful for initializing your database in a development or testing environment.\n\nRemember to replace `'postgresql://user:password@localhost/mydatabase'` with your actual database connection string. The `CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS` SQL command will ensure that the schema is created if it doesn't already exist.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to create the required schema and tables without encountering the \"schema doesn't exist\" error in PostgreSQL."
