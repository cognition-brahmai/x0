I have a 'Group' model that consists of many 'Player' instances through the 'GroupMember' model. Here is my current code:\n\n```python\nclass Group(models.Model):\n    member = models.ManyToManyField(Player, through='GroupMember')\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=20, unique=True)\n    join_password = models.CharField(max_length=20)\n    date_created = datetime.datetime.now()\n\n    def __unicode__(self):\n        return str(self.name)\n\nclass GroupMember(models.Model):\n    member = models.ForeignKey(Player)\n    group = models.ForeignKey(Group)\n    rating = models.IntegerField(default=1500)\n    played = models.IntegerField(default=0)\n    wins = models.IntegerField(default=0)\n    losses = models.IntegerField(default=0)\n    experience = models.IntegerField(default=0)\n    admin = models.BooleanField(default=0)\n```\n\nI'm unsure of how to construct a query that would return groups containing both players."

        "content": "To filter groups that contain two specific players in a many-to-many relationship using Django's ORM, you can leverage the `Q` objects to construct a query that finds groups where both players are members. Here\u2019s how you can achieve that:\n\nLet's assume you have two specific `Player` instances, `player1` and `player2`, for which you want to find common groups:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db.models import Q\n\n# Assuming player1 and player2 are your Player instances\nplayer1 = Player.objects.get(id=1)  # replace with appropriate lookup\nplayer2 = Player.objects.get(id=2)  # replace with appropriate lookup\n\n# Query to find groups containing both players\ngroups_with_both_players = Group.objects.filter(\n    Q(groupmember__member=player1) & Q(groupmember__member=player2)\n).distinct()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `Q` objects are used to construct complex queries. You can combine multiple `Q` objects using `&` (AND) or `|` (OR) operators.\n- In the query, `groupmember__member=player1` filters groups that have `player1` as a member, and `groupmember__member=player2` filters groups that have `player2` as a member.\n- The `distinct()` method ensures that each group is unique in the result set.\n\nThis query effectively finds all `Group` instances that have both `player1` and `player2` as members, leveraging the intermediate `GroupMember` model to perform the many-to-many relationship lookup."
