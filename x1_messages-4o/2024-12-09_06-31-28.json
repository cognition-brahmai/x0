        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to trying to concatenate an integer with a string using the `+` operator, which is not allowed in Python. In your code, this happens in the line:\n\n```python\nprint(numlist.pop(2) + \" has been removed\")\n```\n\nHere, `numlist.pop(2)` returns an integer (the number you want to remove from the list), and you're trying to directly concatenate it with the string \" has been removed\". To fix this error, you need to convert the integer to a string before concatenation. You can do this using the `str()` function. Here's the corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nnum1 = int(input(\"What is your first number? \"))\nnum2 = int(input(\"What is your second number? \"))\nnum3 = int(input(\"What is your third number? \"))\nnumlist = [num1, num2, num3]\nprint(numlist)\nprint(\"Now I will remove the 3rd number\")\nremoved_number = numlist.pop(2)\nprint(str(removed_number) + \" has been removed\")\nprint(\"The list now looks like \" + str(numlist))\n```\n\nBy converting `removed_number` to a string with `str(removed_number)`, the concatenation will work correctly, and you should be able to run your program without encountering the TypeError."
