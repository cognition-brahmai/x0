        "content": "How can I declare default values for instance variables in Python? Is it better to use a class variable or an instance variable? I've seen two different methods, one uses a class variable like this:\n\n```python\nclass Foo:\n    num = 1\n```\nand the other uses an instance variable inside the constructor like this:\n\n```python\nclass Foo:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.num = 1\n```\nIn both cases, increasing the value of num by 1 for an instance of the class Foo works well:\n\n```python\nbar = Foo()\nbar.num += 1\n```\nI understand that the first method creates a class variable while the second does not. However, if my requirement does not involve class variables, but only needs to set a default value for my instance variables, are both methods equally good? Is one of them more 'pythonic' than the other? I noticed in the Django tutorial, they use the second method to declare Models. I personally find the second method more elegant, but I'd like to know what the 'standard' way is."

        "content": "In Python, the choice between using a class variable and an instance variable for setting default values largely depends on the specific use case and desired behavior. Both methods you mentioned have their own characteristics, and understanding these can help you decide which is more appropriate for your situation.\n\n### Class Variables\n\n- **Shared Across Instances**: Class variables are shared across all instances of the class. If you change the value of a class variable, it changes for all instances unless specifically overridden by an instance. This can be useful if you want a shared default that is the same for all instances and can be updated collectively.\n\n```python\nclass Foo:\n    num = 1  # Class variable\n\nbar1 = Foo()\nbar2 = Foo()\nbar1.num += 1\nprint(bar1.num)  # Output: 2\nprint(bar2.num)  # Output: 1 (unchanged because num is overridden in bar1)\n```\n\n### Instance Variables\n\n- **Unique to Each Instance**: Instance variables are defined within the `__init__` method and are unique to each instance. This is typically preferred when each instance should have its own state, independent of others.\n\n```python\nclass Foo:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.num = 1  # Instance variable\n\nbar1 = Foo()\nbar2 = Foo()\nbar1.num += 1\nprint(bar1.num)  # Output: 2\nprint(bar2.num)  # Output: 1 (each instance maintains its own state)\n```\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- **Instance Variables for Per-Instance State**: If you want each instance to have its own independent value, use instance variables. This is more common and generally considered more 'pythonic' for defining per-instance attributes.\n\n- **Class Variables for Shared State or Constants**: Use class variables when you want to share a value across all instances or define a constant that doesn\u2019t change per instance. \n\nGiven your requirement that suggests you do not need shared class variables, the second method (using instance variables) is the more appropriate and 'pythonic' way to go. This is why you see it commonly used in frameworks like Django, where each model instance should maintain its own state. It provides clarity and ensures that each object is independent, avoiding unintended side effects that can arise from shared class variables."
