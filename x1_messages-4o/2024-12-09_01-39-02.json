However, I've noticed that this feature is not supported in Python 3 and I'm forced to use lambda with magic indexes, which I find unappealing. If I was to use a function instead of a lambda, I could unpack the tuple in the function arguments. However, this forces me to create unnecessary functions and think of names for them. Is there a good alternative or equivalent for auto tuple unpacking in Python 3 lambda functions?\n\nHere's the Python 2 code I'm referring to:\n```python\npoints = [ (1,2), (2,3)]\nmin(points, key=lambda (x, y): (x*x + y*y))\n```\nAnd here's what I'm forced to do in Python 3:\n```python\npoints = [ (1,2), (2,3)]\nmin(points, key=lambda p: p[0]*p[0] + p[1]*p[1])\n```\nAlternatively with a defined function:\n```python\ndef some_name_to_think_of(p):\n  x, y = p\n  return x*x + y*y\n```\nIs there a better way to do this in Python 3?"

        "content": "In Python 3, the syntax for tuple unpacking in lambda functions has indeed changed, and you can't directly unpack a tuple in the argument list of a lambda. However, you can achieve similar functionality with a combination of techniques to keep your code clean and concise.\n\nOne approach is to use a list comprehension or a generator expression to unpack the tuples before applying the key function. This way, you can avoid defining a separate function and keep your code more readable:\n\n```python\npoints = [(1, 2), (2, 3)]\nmin_value = min(points, key=lambda p: (p[0]**2 + p[1]**2))\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use a short helper function within the lambda itself to perform unpacking, which keeps everything inline but still readable:\n\n```python\npoints = [(1, 2), (2, 3)]\nmin_value = min(points, key=lambda p: (lambda x, y: x**2 + y**2)(*p))\n```\n\nThis inline lambda function allows you to unpack `p` into `x` and `y` within the lambda itself, maintaining readability without needing a separate named function.\n\nBoth of these approaches help you avoid creating a separate named function while still preserving tuple unpacking and maintaining clarity in your code."
