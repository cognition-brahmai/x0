If I open a console outside the virtualenv, `pkg_resources` is present, but the error persists. Can anyone help me understand why `pkg_resources` is not on the path?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering typically arises when the `setuptools` package is not correctly installed in your virtual environment. The fact that `pkg_resources` is available outside the virtual environment indicates that `setuptools` is installed globally but not properly configured in your virtual environment.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Virtual Environment Activation:**\n   Make sure your virtual environment is activated before installing any packages. You can activate it using:\n   ```bash\n   source /var/www/mydir/virtualenvs/dev/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n2. **Upgrade `setuptools` and `pip` in the Virtual Environment:**\n   Sometimes, upgrading `setuptools` and `pip` can resolve such issues. Run the following commands after activating the virtual environment:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade pip\n   pip install --upgrade setuptools\n   ```\n\n3. **Reinstall `setuptools`:**\n   If upgrading doesn't fix the issue, try reinstalling `setuptools`:\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall setuptools\n   pip install setuptools\n   ```\n\n4. **Check Virtual Environment Path:**\n   Ensure that your virtual environment paths are set correctly. Sometimes, there might be a misconfiguration that causes the system to not pick up the packages. Check your `sys.path` by running a simple Python script:\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   print(sys.path)\n   ```\n   This will help you verify that the paths are pointing to the correct locations in your virtual environment.\n\n5. **Recreate the Virtual Environment:**\n   If none of the above steps work, you might want to recreate the virtual environment:\n   ```bash\n   deactivate  # First, deactivate the current virtual environment\n   mv /var/www/mydir/virtualenvs/dev /var/www/mydir/virtualenvs/dev_backup  # Backup the current environment\n   python -m venv /var/www/mydir/virtualenvs/dev\n   source /var/www/mydir/virtualenvs/dev/bin/activate\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n6. **Ensure Python Version Compatibility:**\n   Since you're using Python 2.6, ensure that all your tools and packages are compatible with this version, especially since Python 2.6 is quite outdated.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `pkg_resources` issue in your virtual environment. If the problem persists, it might be worth considering an upgrade to a more recent version of Python, as Python 2.6 is no longer supported and might not be compatible with many modern packages."
