Here is the class definition:\n\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n\n    def method(arg):\n        print(arg)\n```\n\nI then use this class to create an object like this:\n\n```python\nmy_object = MyClass()\n```\n\nWhen I try to call the method by passing in a single argument like this:\n\n```python\nmy_object.method(\"foo\")\n```\n\nI get the following TypeError:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nTypeError: method() takes exactly 1 positional argument (2 given)\n```\n\nI don't understand why Python is telling me I gave it two arguments when I only passed one. Can someone explain why this is happening and how to fix it?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the way instance methods are defined in Python classes. When you define a method in a class, you need to include `self` as the first parameter in the method definition. The `self` parameter is a reference to the instance of the class and is automatically passed by Python when you call the method on an instance of the class.\n\nHere's how you can fix your class definition:\n\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n\n    def method(self, arg):\n        print(arg)\n```\n\nWith this definition, when you call `my_object.method(\"foo\")`, Python will pass the instance `my_object` as the first argument (`self`) and \"foo\" as the second argument (`arg`). Therefore, the method will receive the correct number of arguments.\n\nHere's your corrected code and how you can use it:\n\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n\n    def method(self, arg):\n        print(arg)\n\nmy_object = MyClass()\nmy_object.method(\"foo\")  # This will correctly print \"foo\"\n```\n\nBy adding `self` as the first parameter in your method definition, the error should be resolved."
