The error occurs when the model is run on a GPU but the code works well when not using the `strategy = tensorflow.distribute.MirroredStrategy()`. However, this workaround fails for larger datasets due to memory shortage. The error message I receive is `tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError:  assertion failed: [predictions must be >= 0] [Condition x >= y did not hold element-wise:] [x (sequential/dense_4/Softmax:0) = ] [[nan nan nan...]...] [y (Cast_6/x:0) = ] [0] [[{{node assert_greater_equal/Assert/AssertGuard/else/_21/assert_greater_equal/Assert/AssertGuard/Assert}}]] [Op:__inference_train_function_1270]`."

        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that there might be NaN (Not a Number) values in your model's predictions, which is causing the assertion to fail when using the `MirroredStrategy`. This issue can occur due to several reasons, especially when running on a GPU with distributed strategies. Here are some potential causes and solutions to address this problem:\n\n1. **Numerical Instability**: \n   - **Gradient Explosion**: If your model outputs NaN values, it could be due to exploding gradients. Try using gradient clipping to prevent this:\n     ```python\n     optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(clipnorm=1.0)\n     model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, ...)\n     ```\n   - **Learning Rate**: A high learning rate can cause instability. Try reducing the learning rate to see if it resolves the issue.\n\n2. **Initialization**: \n   - Check your weight initialization strategy. Use initializers like `tf.keras.initializers.HeNormal()` or `tf.keras.initializers.GlorotUniform()` for better stability.\n\n3. **Data Preprocessing**: \n   - Ensure your input data is properly normalized. For image data, this often means scaling the pixel values to the range [0, 1] or [-1, 1].\n   - Check for any NaN or infinite values in your input data. These can propagate through the model and lead to NaN predictions.\n\n4. **Batch Size**: \n   - Large batch sizes can lead to memory issues and numerical instability. Try reducing the batch size to see if it helps.\n\n5. **Loss Function**: \n   - If you're using a custom loss function, ensure it's implemented correctly and is numerically stable.\n   - For classification tasks, use `CategoricalCrossentropy` or `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy` with `from_logits=True` if your model doesn't include a softmax layer.\n\n6. **Hardware/Configuration Issues**: \n   - Ensure your TensorFlow installation is properly configured for GPU usage. Sometimes, issues in drivers or CUDA/CuDNN versions can lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n7. **Debugging**:\n   - Use TensorFlow's debugging tools to inspect the tensors at different points in your model to identify where NaNs are being introduced.\n   - Add checks in your training loop to log or break if NaNs are detected in the gradients or weights.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you might set up your training with some of these considerations:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Define strategy\nstrategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()\n\nwith strategy.scope():\n    # Build and compile your model\n    model = ...  # Define your model\n\n    # Use an optimizer with gradient clipping\n    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001, clipnorm=1.0)\n    model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(train_dataset, epochs=..., validation_data=val_dataset, ...)\n```\n\nTry implementing these suggestions and see if they resolve the issue. If the problem persists, reviewing the complete stack trace and additional logs might provide more insights into the specific cause of the error."
