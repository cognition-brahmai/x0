I think it's still pretty reasonable. Have you seen how prices have been going up everywhere lately?\n\n**Customer 1:** Sure, I get that prices are rising, but doubling the price seems a bit excessive, don't you think? It's not like the quality has improved or anything.\n\n**Customer 2:** Well, I think it's more about the costs they have to cover. Inflation, supply chain issues, all that stuff adds up. Plus, it's still cheaper than some of the alternatives out there.\n\n**Customer 1:** Maybe, but that doesn't mean I should just accept it without questioning. I feel like they're taking advantage of the situation.\n\n**Customer 2:** I see your point, but sometimes we have to weigh the convenience and availability against the cost. If you really need it, it's probably worth paying a bit more.\n\n**Customer 1:** I guess. It just feels frustrating when you have a budget to stick to and prices keep shooting up like this.\n\n**Customer 2:** I hear you. Maybe you can shop around or look for discounts. Sometimes you can find deals online that aren't advertised in-store.\n\n**Customer 1:** That's a good idea. I'll definitely keep an eye out for any promotions or sales. Thanks for the suggestion.\n\n**Customer 2:** No problem. Hopefully, prices will stabilize soon and we won't have to worry as much!"
