For instance, in the following code, why is the function `f()` able to alter the value of the argument `x` as perceived within `main()`, but not the value of `n`?\n\n```python\ndef f(n, x):\n    n = 2\n    x.append(4)\n    print('In f():', n, x)\n\ndef main():\n    n = 1\n    x = [0,1,2,3]\n    print('Before:', n, x)\n    f(n, x)\n    print('After: ', n, x)\n\nmain()\n```\n\nThe output is as follows:\n\n```python\nBefore: 1 [0, 1, 2, 3]\nIn f(): 2 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\nAfter:  1 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n```"

        "content": "The behavior you are observing in Python is due to how Python handles variable assignment and mutability of objects.\n\n1. **Immutable vs. Mutable Objects**: \n   - **Immutable Objects**: These are objects whose state cannot be modified after they are created. Examples include integers, floats, strings, and tuples.\n   - **Mutable Objects**: These are objects whose state can be modified. Examples include lists, dictionaries, and sets.\n\n2. **Assignment in Python**:\n   - When you assign a value to a variable, you're essentially binding that variable name to an object in memory.\n   - For immutable objects like integers, any operation that alters the value will result in a new object being created and the variable being bound to this new object.\n   - For mutable objects like lists, you can modify the object in place without changing the reference.\n\nLet's apply this to your code:\n\n- **`n` is an integer**, which is an immutable object. When you execute the line `n = 2` inside the function `f()`, you are creating a new integer object with the value `2` and binding the local name `n` to this new object. This does not affect the `n` in `main()`, which still points to the integer `1`.\n\n- **`x` is a list**, which is a mutable object. The operation `x.append(4)` modifies the list object in place by adding a new element to it. Since `x` in `main()` and `x` in `f()` both refer to the same list object, the change is reflected in `main()` after the function call.\n\nIn summary, whether a change in a function affects the original object depends on the mutability of the object and whether you are modifying the object itself or just reassigning the reference."
