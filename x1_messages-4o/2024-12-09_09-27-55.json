Here's a simple example of how you can do this:\n\n```python\n# Example array\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# Calculate the sum of all elements in the array\ntotal_sum = sum(numbers)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"The sum of all elements in the array is:\", total_sum)\n```\n\nIn this code, `numbers` is a list of integers. The `sum(numbers)` function computes the sum of all elements in the list, and the result is stored in the variable `total_sum`. Finally, it prints the result. You can replace the `numbers` list with your own array of numbers to calculate its sum."
