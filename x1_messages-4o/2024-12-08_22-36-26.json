Here's a code snippet that demonstrates how to find the index of the substring \"application\" in the given sentence:\n\n```python\n# Define the sentence\nsentence = \"John is a software engineer who has submitted an application for the role of a data scientist at ABC Corp.\"\n\n# Define the substring we are looking for\nsubstring = \"application\"\n\n# Find the index of the substring\nindex = sentence.find(substring)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"The index of '{substring}' in the sentence is: {index}\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the starting index of the substring \"application\" within the sentence. If the substring is not found, the `find()` method will return `-1`."
