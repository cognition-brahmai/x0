The prism has dimensions of 19.6 cm in length, 10 cm in width, and 5.9 cm in height. The ambient temperature is 25\u00b0C, and the prism is initially at a temperature of 50\u00b0C. Assume steady-state conditions and neglect any heat loss to the surroundings. Show all calculations and provide the final answer in square centimeters."

        "content": "To calculate the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to use the formula for the surface area of a rectangular prism:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Surface Area} = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( l \\) is the length, \\( w \\) is the width, and \\( h \\) is the height.\n\nGiven:\n- Length (\\( l \\)) = 19.6 cm\n- Width (\\( w \\)) = 10 cm\n- Height (\\( h \\)) = 5.9 cm\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Surface Area} = 2(19.6 \\, \\text{cm} \\times 10 \\, \\text{cm}) + 2(19.6 \\, \\text{cm} \\times 5.9 \\, \\text{cm}) + 2(10 \\, \\text{cm} \\times 5.9 \\, \\text{cm})\n\\]\n\nCalculate each term separately:\n\n1. \\( 2(19.6 \\times 10) = 2 \\times 196 = 392 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\)\n2. \\( 2(19.6 \\times 5.9) = 2 \\times 115.64 = 231.28 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\)\n3. \\( 2(10 \\times 5.9) = 2 \\times 59 = 118 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\)\n\nAdd these values together to find the total surface area:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Surface Area} = 392 \\, \\text{cm}^2 + 231.28 \\, \\text{cm}^2 + 118 \\, \\text{cm}^2 = 741.28 \\, \\text{cm}^2\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the surface area of the rectangular prism is \\( 741.28 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\).\n\nNote: The thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, ambient temperature, and initial temperature are part of the material's thermal properties but are not needed to calculate the surface area under the given conditions."
