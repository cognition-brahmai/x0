I have managed to set the Python version to 3 by adding `export PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3` to my `.bashrc` file and this works when I run Spark interactively. However, I encounter an issue when I try to run a standalone program in local mode. The error message I receive is: \"Exception: Python in worker has different version 3.4 than that in driver 2.7, PySpark cannot run with different minor versions\". I tried setting the Python version for the driver by using `export PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON=python3` but it doesn't seem to work. How can I correctly set the Python version for the driver?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to a mismatch between the Python version used by the Spark driver and the workers. To ensure that both the driver and the workers use Python 3, you'll need to set the environment variables correctly before starting your Spark application.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Ensure Consistent Python Versions**: Make sure that both `PYSPARK_PYTHON` and `PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON` are set to the same Python 3 interpreter. You can do this by adding the following lines to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` (and make sure to source it afterwards):\n\n   ```bash\n   export PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3\n   export PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON=python3\n   ```\n\n2. **Sourcing the Configuration**: After updating your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`, ensure you source it by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bashrc\n   ```\n\n   or\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bash_profile\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify Python Versions**: Before running your Spark application, double-check that these environment variables are correctly set by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   echo $PYSPARK_PYTHON\n   echo $PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON\n   ```\n\n   Both should output `python3`.\n\n4. **Run Your Spark Application**: Now, try running your standalone Spark program. The Python versions should be consistent, and the error should be resolved.\n\n5. **Specifying Python Path (Optional)**: If you need to specify a specific path for your Python interpreter (for example, if you have multiple versions of Python 3), you can do so by setting the environment variables to point to the exact path of the Python interpreter:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PYSPARK_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3.4\n   export PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3.4\n   ```\n\n6. **Ensure Compatibility**: Verify that all necessary Python packages required by your Spark job are available in the Python 3 environment you are using.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to run your Spark application with Python 3 without encountering version mismatch errors."
