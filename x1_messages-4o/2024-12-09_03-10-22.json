I am doing some web scraping and the websites I am dealing with frequently use HTML entities to represent non-ASCII characters. Is there a Python utility that takes a string with HTML entities and returns a Unicode type? For instance, I often get the HTML entity \"&#x01ce;\", which represents the character \"\u01ce\" with a tone mark. In binary, this is represented as the 16 bit 01ce. I would like to convert this HTML entity into the Unicode value \"u'\\u01ce'\"."

This function will decode HTML entities and return a Unicode string. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nimport html\n\n# Your string with HTML entities\nhtml_string = \"&#x01ce;\"\n\n# Convert HTML entities to Unicode\nunicode_string = html.unescape(html_string)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(unicode_string)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n\u01ce\n```\n\nThe `html.unescape()` function is effective for converting both named and numeric character references, including hexadecimal and decimal entities, into their corresponding Unicode characters. This method should be suitable for your web scraping needs when dealing with non-ASCII characters represented as HTML entities."
