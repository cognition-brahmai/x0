        "content": "To extract metadata such as Title, Author, Subject, and Keywords from a PDF file using Python, you can use the `PyPDF2` library, which provides functionalities to read PDF files and access their metadata. Here's a step-by-step guide to doing this:\n\n1. **Install PyPDF2**: If you haven't already installed PyPDF2, you can do so using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install PyPDF2\n   ```\n\n2. **Extract Metadata**: Use the following Python script to extract the metadata from a PDF file:\n\n   ```python\n   import PyPDF2\n\n   # Open the PDF file in read-binary mode\n   with open('example.pdf', 'rb') as file:\n       # Create a PDF reader object\n       pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)\n\n       # Get the document information\n       document_info = pdf_reader.metadata\n\n       # Extract metadata\n       title = document_info.title\n       author = document_info.author\n       subject = document_info.subject\n       keywords = document_info.keywords\n\n       # Print the extracted metadata\n       print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n       print(f\"Author: {author}\")\n       print(f\"Subject: {subject}\")\n       print(f\"Keywords: {keywords}\")\n   ```\n\nReplace `'example.pdf'` with the path to your PDF file. The script will print out the metadata if it's available in the PDF file's properties.\n\n### Notes:\n- **PyPDF2 Limitations**: PyPDF2 is a pure Python library and might not support some of the advanced features or formats in certain PDF files, especially if they are encrypted or have complex structures.\n- **Alternative Libraries**: If you need more advanced features, consider using `pdfminer.six` or `pikepdf`, which might provide more robust handling of PDFs.\n\nThis code should help you extract the basic metadata from most PDF files. If you encounter any issues or need further customization, feel free to ask!"
