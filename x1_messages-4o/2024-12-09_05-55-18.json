I want to convert a number into its Unicode equivalent using the built-in function 'unichr' as shown below:\n```python\nprint repr(unichr(8224))\n```\nThis should output: `u'\\u2020'`. However, I keep encountering a 'NameError' stating that 'unichr' is not defined even when I try it with different values like `unichr(10000)`. Is there a specific module I need to import or is there another issue causing this problem?"

        "content": "In Python 3.x, the `unichr()` function has been replaced by the `chr()` function. The `unichr()` function was used in Python 2.x to return the Unicode string representing a character whose Unicode code point is the integer passed to it. In Python 3.x, `chr()` serves the same purpose, as Python 3 uses Unicode by default for strings.\n\nYou can use the `chr()` function in Python 3.1 to achieve what you want. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nprint(repr(chr(8224)))\n```\n\nThis should output: `'\\u2020'`, which is the Unicode character for the dagger symbol (\u2020).\n\nIf you want to ensure that the output is displayed with a Unicode string prefix (like `u'\\u2020'`), you can explicitly convert it to a Unicode string, though in Python 3.x, this is implicit. However, you might see outputs differently depending on the version or environment, but rest assured that `chr()` is functioning correctly in this context."
