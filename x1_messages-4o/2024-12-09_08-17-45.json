I have used the following ruby code to convert it to epoch time: `DateTime.parse('2009-03-08T00:27:31.807').strftime(\"%Q\")`, which gives me `\"1236472051807\"`. However, when I try to convert this back to the original date time in Python using `time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', time.gmtime(1236472051807))`, I don't get the original date time back. Instead, I get `'41152-03-29 02:50:07'`. Is this issue related to how I am formatting the time in Python?"

        "content": "Yes, the issue lies in how you're interpreting the epoch time in Python. In Ruby, the method `strftime(\"%Q\")` gives you the time in milliseconds since the epoch (Unix time), which is why you get `\"1236472051807\"`. However, in Python, the `time.gmtime()` function expects the epoch time to be in seconds, not milliseconds.\n\nHere's how you can convert the Ruby-generated epoch time correctly in Python:\n\n1. First, divide the epoch time by 1000 to convert milliseconds to seconds.\n2. Then, use `time.gmtime()` to convert it back to the original date-time.\n\nHere's the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\n# Ruby generated epoch time in milliseconds\nepoch_milliseconds = 1236472051807\n\n# Convert milliseconds to seconds\nepoch_seconds = epoch_milliseconds / 1000\n\n# Convert to original date-time\noriginal_datetime = time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', time.gmtime(epoch_seconds))\n\nprint(original_datetime)  # Output should be: 2009-03-08 00:27:31\n```\n\nThis should give you the correct original date-time in Python."
