        "content": "Certainly! The behavior you're observing with the tilde operator (`~`) in Python is related to how numbers are represented in binary and how the bitwise NOT operation works.\n\nIn Python, the boolean value `True` is internally represented as the integer `1`. When you apply the bitwise NOT operator (`~`), it inverts all the bits of the number. This is how it works:\n\n1. **Binary Representation of True**:  \n   `True` is equivalent to the integer `1`, which is represented in binary as `0000...0001` (assuming a 32-bit integer for simplicity).\n\n2. **Bitwise NOT Operation**:  \n   The bitwise NOT operator (`~`) flips each bit in the number. For `1` (`0000...0001`), this operation results in `1111...1110`.\n\n3. **Two's Complement Representation**:  \n   Python uses a system called two's complement for representing signed integers. In two's complement, the leftmost bit is the sign bit. The number `1111...1110` is interpreted as `-2`.\n\n   Here's why:\n   \n   - The first bit `1` indicates a negative number.\n   - To find the magnitude, you invert the bits again and add 1:  \n     - Invert `1111...1110` to `0000...0001`.\n     - Add `1`, which gives `0000...0010`, equivalent to `2`.\n\n   Since the sign bit was `1`, the result is `-2`.\n\nSo, when you apply `~True`, you're effectively computing `~1`, which results in `-2` due to the two's complement representation of negative numbers."
