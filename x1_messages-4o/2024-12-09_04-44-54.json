The structure of my data is as follows:\n\n- data_folder/serial_number=1/cur_date=20-12-2012/abcdsd0324324.snappy.parquet\n- data_folder/serial_number=2/cur_date=27-12-2012/asdsdfsd0324324.snappy.parquet\n\nI tried using the ParquetDataset module from pyarrow with the following code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport pyarrow.parquet as pq\nimport s3fs\na = \"s3://my_bucker/path/to/data_folder/\"\ndataset = pq.ParquetDataset(a)\n```\nHowever, I received this error:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"/home/my_username/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pyarrow/parquet.py\", line 502, in __init__\n    self.metadata_path) = _make_manifest(path_or_paths, self.fs)\n  File \"/home/my_username/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pyarrow/parquet.py\", line 601, in _make_manifest\n    .format(path))\nOSError: Passed non-file path: s3://my_bucker/path/to/data_folder/\n```\nUpon reading the pyarrow documentation, I attempted to use s3fs as the file system, but I then received this error:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"/home/my_username/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pyarrow/parquet.py\", line 502, in __init__\n    self.metadata_path) = _make_manifest(path_or_paths, self.fs)\n  File \"/home/my_username/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pyarrow/parquet.py\", line 583, in _make_manifest\n    if is_string(path_or_paths) and fs.isdir(path_or_paths):\nAttributeError: module 's3fs' has no attribute 'isdir'\n```\nI am not able to use spark/pyspark due to limitations with my ECS cluster. Is there a Pythonic way to efficiently read parquet files from such partitioned directories in S3? I'd prefer to use fastparquet or pyarrow, but I'm open to other Python solutions as well."

        "content": "To read partitioned Parquet files from Amazon S3 using PyArrow and S3FS, you can follow these steps. The error you encountered is due to the incorrect usage of the file system and path handling. Here's a way to properly set up and read your data:\n\n1. **Install Required Libraries**: Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can do this using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pyarrow s3fs pandas\n   ```\n\n2. **Set Up the S3 File System**: Use S3FS to interface with S3, ensuring you have the correct permissions and credentials configured (e.g., via AWS CLI or environment variables).\n\n3. **Use PyArrow with S3FS**: Here's how you can set up your code to read the partitioned data:\n\n   ```python\n   import pyarrow as pa\n   import pyarrow.parquet as pq\n   import s3fs\n\n   # Create an S3 FileSystem object\n   s3 = s3fs.S3FileSystem()\n\n   # Define the path to your S3 bucket\n   path = \"s3://my_bucket/path/to/data_folder/\"\n\n   # Use the PyArrow ParquetDataset with the S3 filesystem\n   dataset = pq.ParquetDataset(path, filesystem=s3)\n\n   # Read the dataset into a PyArrow Table\n   table = dataset.read()\n\n   # Convert the Table to a Pandas DataFrame\n   df = table.to_pandas()\n\n   print(df.head())\n   ```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **S3FileSystem**: Ensure that `s3fs.S3FileSystem()` is used to create the file system object that will interact with your S3 bucket.\n- **ParquetDataset**: When using `pq.ParquetDataset`, pass the `filesystem` parameter with your S3 file system object.\n- **Path Format**: Make sure the S3 path is correctly formatted and that you have the appropriate permissions to read the data.\n- **AWS Credentials**: Ensure your AWS credentials are set up correctly. You might need to configure them through the AWS CLI or set environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`).\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to read your partitioned Parquet files from S3 efficiently without needing Spark or PySpark."
