Currently, my code is able to find the newest file in the directory, but it doesn't filter by file type. Here is my current code:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nnewest = max(os.listdir('.'), key = os.path.getctime)\nprint(newest)\n```\n\nI need a solution that only fetches the newest MP3 file in the directory."

        "content": "To modify your existing Python code so that it only finds the most recently modified file with a `.MP3` extension, you can filter the list of files using a list comprehension to include only those files that have the `.MP3` extension. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# List all files in the current directory with .MP3 extension\nmp3_files = [f for f in os.listdir('.') if f.lower().endswith('.mp3')]\n\n# Find the newest MP3 file based on creation time\nif mp3_files:\n    newest_mp3 = max(mp3_files, key=os.path.getctime)\n    print(\"Newest MP3 file:\", newest_mp3)\nelse:\n    print(\"No MP3 files found in the directory.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `os.listdir('.')` lists all files and directories in the current directory.\n- The list comprehension `[f for f in os.listdir('.') if f.lower().endswith('.mp3')]` filters this list to include only files with the `.MP3` extension.\n- `max(mp3_files, key=os.path.getctime)` finds the file with the most recent creation time from the filtered list.\n- The `if mp3_files:` condition checks if there are any MP3 files in the list before attempting to find the newest one, preventing errors if the list is empty."
