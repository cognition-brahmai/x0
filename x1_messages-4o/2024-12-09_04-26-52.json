        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the `math.exp` function is trying to evaluate a very large exponent, which results in a number that exceeds the range that can be handled by floating-point numbers in Python. Specifically, the expression `-4*1000000*-0.0641515994108` results in a large positive number, and `math.exp` of a large positive number results in an overflow.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can use the `decimal` module, which allows for arbitrary precision arithmetic, or you can simplify the mathematical expression if possible. Here's how you can use the `decimal` module:\n\n```python\nimport decimal\n\n# Set the precision high enough to handle large numbers\ndecimal.getcontext().prec = 50\n\n# Convert the expression to Decimal\nlarge_number = decimal.Decimal(-4) * decimal.Decimal(1000000) * decimal.Decimal(-0.0641515994108)\n\n# Compute the exponential using Decimal\nresult = 1 - decimal.Decimal.exp(large_number)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you know that the result of the exponent is significantly large, you might consider if there's a mathematical simplification or approximation that can be used, such as considering limits or using logarithmic identities. If the value of the exponent is large enough that the exponential term effectively becomes zero in a practical sense, you might approximate the result accordingly.\n\nIf you have a specific context or purpose for this calculation, please share it, and I might be able to suggest a more tailored approach."
