        "content": "To add the additional test cases to an existing testing framework using Scala, you need to follow these steps. I'll also guide you on how to organize them in an Excel table for clarity and planning.\n\n### Step 1: Update the Excel Table\n\nFirst, update your Excel table to include the new test cases. The updated table should look like this:\n\n| Test Case # | Length | Width | Expected Output |\n|-------------|--------|-------|----------------|\n| 1           | 8.9    | 3.2   | 28.48          |\n| 2           | 2.5    | 2.5   | 6.25           |\n| 3           | 0      | 2.8   | 0              |\n| 4           | 12.6   | 5.3   | 66.78          |\n| 5           | 6.7    | 6.7   | 44.89          |\n| 6           | 4.1    | 0     | 0              |\n\n### Step 2: Modify the Scala Test File\n\nAssuming you are using a testing framework like ScalaTest, you need to add the new test cases in your test file. Here is an example of how you might structure your tests:\n\n```scala\nimport org.scalatest.flatspec.AnyFlatSpec\nimport org.scalatest.matchers.should.Matchers\n\nclass CalculateAreaTest extends AnyFlatSpec with Matchers {\n\n  \"calculateArea\" should \"return the correct area for given length and width\" in {\n    val testCases = List(\n      (8.9, 3.2, 28.48),\n      (2.5, 2.5, 6.25),\n      (0, 2.8, 0),\n      (12.6, 5.3, 66.78),\n      (6.7, 6.7, 44.89),\n      (4.1, 0, 0)\n    )\n\n    testCases.foreach { case (length, width, expected) =>\n      val result = calculateArea(length, width)\n      result shouldEqual expected\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Run Your Tests\n\nAfter updating your test file, make sure to run your tests to verify that everything is working as expected. You can run them using your IDE or via the command line.\n\nIf you are using SBT (Scala Build Tool), you can run your tests with the following command:\n\n```bash\nsbt test\n```\n\n### Step 4: Document Changes\n\nIt\u2019s always a good practice to document the changes you made. Update any related documentation, comments, or README files to reflect the new test cases.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully add additional test cases to your existing testing framework in Scala. The key is to ensure that your tests are comprehensive and cover a variety of scenarios to validate the functionality of your `calculateArea` function."
