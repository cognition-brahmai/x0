Moreover, is there a comprehensive tool or function in MATLAB that can analyze the complexity and frequency of vocabulary to determine the level of formality in written language?"

        "content": "Certainly! Here are some formal adjectives to describe weather conditions in written language:\n\n1. **Inclement** - Unpleasantly cold or wet.\n2. **Balmy** - Pleasantly warm.\n3. **Torrid** - Very hot and dry.\n4. **Frigid** - Extremely cold.\n5. **Tempestuous** - Characterized by strong and turbulent or conflicting emotions, often used to describe stormy weather.\n6. **Serene** - Calm, peaceful, and untroubled.\n7. **Sultry** - Hot and humid.\n8. **Zephyr-like** - Gentle breeze; mild.\n\nRegarding the analysis of the complexity and frequency of vocabulary to determine the level of formality in written language, MATLAB itself does not have a built-in function specifically for this purpose. However, you can achieve this by using MATLAB in conjunction with text analysis tools or by creating a custom script. Here's a basic approach you could take:\n\n1. **Tokenization**: Break down the text into individual words.\n2. **Frequency Analysis**: Use functions like `count` to determine the frequency of each word.\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: Use a predefined list of words categorized by formality level. Compare your text against this list to score the formality.\n4. **Statistical Analysis**: Use MATLAB's statistical functions to analyze the distribution of word lengths and sentence structures for complexity.\n\nFor a comprehensive solution, integrating MATLAB with external libraries or APIs that specialize in natural language processing (NLP) might be necessary. Tools like Python's NLTK or spaCy can be invoked from MATLAB using its Python interface, allowing for more advanced linguistic analysis."
