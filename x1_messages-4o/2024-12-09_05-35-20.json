The phrase is in the format '%' + [some_phrase] + '%', meaning select all rows that contain this phrase. The Post model is as follows:\n\n```python\nclass Post(db.Model):\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key = True)\n    title = db.Column(db.String(250))\n    content = db.Column(db.String(5000))\n```"

        "content": "To execute a PostgreSQL ILIKE query using SQLAlchemy to select all posts with titles that case-insensitively match a certain phrase, you can use the `ilike()` method provided by SQLAlchemy. This method is specifically designed to handle case-insensitive pattern matching in a way that's compatible with PostgreSQL's `ILIKE`.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\nfrom sqlalchemy import or_\nfrom your_application import db, Post  # adjust the import based on your project's structure\n\n# Assuming you have already set up your database engine\n# engine = create_engine('postgresql://username:password@localhost/mydatabase')\n\n# Create a configured \"Session\" class\nSession = sessionmaker(bind=db.engine)\n\n# Create a session\nsession = Session()\n\n# Define the phrase you are searching for\nsome_phrase = 'your_search_phrase_here'\nsearch_pattern = f'%{some_phrase}%'\n\n# Perform the query\nmatching_posts = session.query(Post).filter(Post.title.ilike(search_pattern)).all()\n\n# Process the results\nfor post in matching_posts:\n    print(f\"ID: {post.id}, Title: {post.title}\")\n\n# Close the session\nsession.close()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Session Management:** Make sure you have set up your SQLAlchemy session correctly. The `Session` is used to interact with the database.\n- **`ilike()` Method:** This is used in place of the `like()` method to perform a case-insensitive search.\n- **`filter()` Method:** This is used to apply conditions to your query.\n- **Pattern Matching:** The `search_pattern` is constructed with '%' wildcards to match any sequence of characters before and after `some_phrase`.\n- **Closing the Session:** Always remember to close your session to free up resources. \n\nThis approach will retrieve all rows from the `Post` table where the `title` contains the specified phrase, regardless of case. Adjust the database engine and session setup as per your actual application configuration."
