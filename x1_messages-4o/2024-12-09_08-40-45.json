For instance, if I have a list like this: [0.5, 0.3, 0.9, 0.8] and I call a function, say f(list, 0.7), it should return the index '2' which is the first index in the list that is greater than 0.7."

        "content": "A Pythonic way to find the first index in a list where the element is greater than a given number `x` is to use a combination of list comprehensions and the `next` function with the `enumerate` function. Here's how you can define such a function:\n\n```python\ndef find_first_greater_index(lst, x):\n    return next((index for index, value in enumerate(lst) if value > x), -1)\n\n# Example usage:\nlst = [0.5, 0.3, 0.9, 0.8]\nresult = find_first_greater_index(lst, 0.7)\nprint(result)  # Output: 2\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n- It uses `enumerate` to iterate over the list with both the index and the value.\n- A generator expression is used to find the first index where the value is greater than `x`.\n- The `next` function retrieves the first item from the generator. If no such item exists, it returns `-1` as a default value."
