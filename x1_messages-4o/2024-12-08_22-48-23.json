        "content": "Your PHP code is almost correct, but there are a few adjustments needed to properly calculate the result. Let's break down each part and make sure everything is working as intended:\n\n1. **Calculate the length of the strings**: This part is correct.\n\n2. **Count the number of vowels in \"society\"**: You are currently using `$word2` to find the number of vowels, but it should focus on the substring \"society\".\n\n3. **Count the number of consonants in \"data\"**: This part is correct.\n\nLet's adjust the code:\n\n```php\n<?php\n\n$word1 = \"large data collection\";\n$word2 = \"benefit society\";\n$word3 = \"data\";\n\n// Calculate lengths\n$length1 = strlen($word1);\n$length2 = strlen($word2);\n\n// Count vowels in \"society\"\n$society = \"society\";\n$vowels = preg_match_all('/[aeiou]/i', $society);\n\n// Count consonants in \"data\"\n$consonants = preg_match_all('/[bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz]/i', $word3);\n\n// Perform the calculation\n$result = (($length1 + $length2) * $vowels) / $consonants;\n\necho \"The result is: \" . $result;\n\n?>\n```\n\nHere are the updates:\n\n- Created a separate variable `$society` specifically for the word \"society\" to count the vowels.\n- Used `$society` instead of `$word2` to find the number of vowels.\n\nThis code will now correctly calculate the desired result based on the equation provided."
