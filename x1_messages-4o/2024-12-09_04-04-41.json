This is typically located in your Conda environment's `bin` directory (e.g., `/path/to/conda/envs/env_name/bin/python` on Unix-like systems or `C:\\path\\to\\conda\\envs\\env_name\\python.exe` on Windows).\n\n7. **Apply and OK**:\n   - After selecting the correct interpreter, click `OK` to close the interpreter selection window.\n   - Click `Apply` and then `OK` to save your changes in the Settings/Preferences dialog.\n\n8. **Verify**:\n   - Open a terminal within PyCharm and ensure that you are using the correct Conda environment by checking the Python version or installed packages.\n\nBy setting up the Conda environment this way, PyCharm will automatically activate the environment whenever you run or debug your project. This eliminates the need to manually activate it via the terminal using `source activate env_name`."
