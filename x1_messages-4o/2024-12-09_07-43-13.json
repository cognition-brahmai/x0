        "content": "In Python, you can't directly use the mathematical syntax like `3*do()` to call a function multiple times. However, you can achieve this using various methods. Here are a few concise ways to call a function multiple times:\n\n1. **Using a Loop:**\n\n   You can use a simple `for` loop to call the function a specific number of times:\n\n   ```python\n   def do():\n       print(\"Function called\")\n\n   for _ in range(3):\n       do()\n   ```\n\n2. **Using List Comprehension:**\n\n   If you don't need to store the results of the function calls, you can use a list comprehension for side effects:\n\n   ```python\n   [do() for _ in range(3)]\n   ```\n\n3. **Using the `map()` Function:**\n\n   You can use the `map()` function with a dummy iterable:\n\n   ```python\n   def do():\n       print(\"Function called\")\n\n   list(map(lambda _: do(), range(3)))\n   ```\n\n4. **Using a Custom Function:**\n\n   You can write a custom function that calls another function multiple times:\n\n   ```python\n   def repeat(func, times):\n       for _ in range(times):\n           func()\n\n   repeat(do, 3)\n   ```\n\nEach of these methods allows you to call a function multiple times, each with its own style and use case. Choose the one that best fits your needs and coding style."
