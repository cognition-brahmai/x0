Here's a Pythonic way to do it:\n\n```python\n# Sample list of dictionaries\nlist_of_dicts = [{1: \"a\"}, {2: \"b\"}]\n\n# The key you want to check for\nkey_to_check = 1\n\n# Using any() with a generator expression\nkey_exists = any(key_to_check in d for d in list_of_dicts)\n\n# Output the result\nif key_exists:\n    print(f\"Key {key_to_check} exists in at least one dictionary.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Key {key_to_check} does not exist in any dictionary.\")\n```\n\nIn this code, `any()` is used in combination with a generator expression `(key_to_check in d for d in list_of_dicts)`, which iterates over each dictionary in the list and checks if the key is present. The `any()` function returns `True` if the key is found in any of the dictionaries, otherwise it returns `False`."
