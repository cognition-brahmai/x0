By this logic, tuples, which are immutable, should also have the same id. But when I try this, I get `False`:\n\n```python\na = (1, 2, 3)\nb = (1, 2, 3)\nprint(a is b)  # outputs: False\n```\n\nCan someone explain why this is the case even though tuples are not mutable?"

        "content": "In Python, the `id` function returns the identity of an object, which is unique for each object during its lifetime. The `is` operator checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory, not just if they have the same value.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the behavior you're observing:\n\n1. **Small Integers and Interning:**\n   - Python has an optimization technique called \"interning\" where it reuses certain immutable objects. Small integers (typically in the range of -5 to 256) and some strings are interned by Python. This is why `a = 10` and `b = 10` have the same `id`\u2014they point to the same interned object.\n\n2. **Lists:**\n   - Lists are mutable, so Python does not intern them. Each time you create a list like `[1, 2, 3]`, a new list object is created in memory, even if the contents are the same. Thus, `a is b` is `False` for lists because `a` and `b` refer to different list objects.\n\n3. **Tuples:**\n   - Tuples are immutable, but Python does not automatically intern all tuples. While tuples themselves are immutable, their contents can be mutable (e.g., a tuple containing a list), which makes interning less straightforward. Therefore, when you create `a = (1, 2, 3)` and `b = (1, 2, 3)`, Python typically does not intern these tuples, resulting in `a is b` being `False`.\n\nIn summary, the interning of objects in Python is an optimization that applies to certain immutable objects like small integers and some strings, but it is not guaranteed for all immutable objects like tuples. This behavior can vary with implementations and versions of Python, but the general rule is to rely on `==` for value equality and `is` for identity comparisons."
