I've looked for an answer on Stack Overflow and found that I should be taking an int(input(prompt)), which I am already doing. My code is as follows:\n\n```\ndef main():      \n    while True:\n        vPopSize = validinput(\"Population Size: \")\n        if vPopSize < 4:\n            print(\"Value too small, should be > 3\")\n            continue\n        else:\n            break\n\ndef validinput(prompt):\n    while True:\n        try:\n            vPopSize = int(input(prompt))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid Entry - try again\")\n            continue\n        else:\n            break\n```\nCan anyone help me solve this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the `validinput` function not returning a value, which means it returns `None` by default. When you attempt to compare `vPopSize` to `4`, you get the `TypeError` because `None` cannot be compared to an integer.\n\nTo fix this problem, you need to ensure that `validinput` returns the integer value after a successful conversion. Here's the modified code:\n\n```python\ndef main():      \n    while True:\n        vPopSize = validinput(\"Population Size: \")\n        if vPopSize < 4:\n            print(\"Value too small, should be > 3\")\n            continue\n        else:\n            break\n\ndef validinput(prompt):\n    while True:\n        try:\n            vPopSize = int(input(prompt))\n            return vPopSize  # Return the integer value\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid Entry - try again\")\n            continue\n\nmain()  # Call the main function to execute the program\n```\n\nHere's what was changed:\n- Added `return vPopSize` in the `try` block of the `validinput` function to return the converted integer when input is valid.\n\nNow, the `validinput` function will properly return the integer value, allowing `vPopSize` to be compared against `4` without causing a `TypeError`."
