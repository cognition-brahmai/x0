        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering indicates that Python 2.7 on your Solaris 10 system is unable to find the necessary code for various hash functions (md5, sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384, sha512). This problem is likely due to a missing or improperly configured cryptographic library that `hashlib` relies on.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check OpenSSL Installation:**\n   - `hashlib` in Python relies on OpenSSL for hashing algorithms. Ensure that OpenSSL is correctly installed on your system. You can check the version with the command:\n     ```sh\n     openssl version\n     ```\n   - If OpenSSL is not installed, or if the version is outdated, you'll need to install or upgrade it. You can typically do this through your package manager or by compiling from source.\n\n2. **Recompile Python with OpenSSL Support:**\n   - If OpenSSL is installed but Python was compiled without OpenSSL support, you may need to recompile Python 2.7. Make sure OpenSSL is installed and accessible during the compilation process.\n   - When configuring Python, use the `--with-openssl` option to specify the path to the OpenSSL installation, if necessary.\n\n3. **Check Environment Variables:**\n   - Ensure the environment variables `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `LIBRARY_PATH` include the path to the OpenSSL libraries. This helps the dynamic linker find the necessary libraries at runtime.\n   - For example, you can set these variables temporarily in your shell like this:\n     ```sh\n     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/openssl/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n     export LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/openssl/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH\n     ```\n\n4. **Verify Python Build Logs:**\n   - If you have access to the build logs from when Python 2.7 was compiled, check them to see if there were any errors or warnings related to the `_ssl` or `_hashlib` modules.\n\n5. **Check Module Availability:**\n   - Ensure that `_hashlib.so` is present in your Python 2.7's `lib-dynload` directory. This shared object file is crucial for `hashlib` to function properly.\n\n6. **Use a Precompiled Package:**\n   - If recompiling is not feasible, consider using a precompiled Python 2.7 package for Solaris that includes proper OpenSSL support. Sometimes package managers or repositories provide these.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the import error for `hashlib` in Python 2.7 on Solaris 10. If the problem persists, consider seeking help from a community or forum specific to Solaris or Python to get more tailored assistance."
