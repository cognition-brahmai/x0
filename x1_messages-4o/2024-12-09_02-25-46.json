        "content": "To configure Vim to adhere to PEP 8 specifically for Python files without affecting other file types, you can create an auto-command in your Vim configuration file (`~/.vimrc` or `init.vim` for Neovim). This setup will apply specific settings only when you're editing Python files. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Install a PEP 8 Linter**: First, ensure you have a PEP 8 linter installed. `flake8` is a popular choice. You can install it using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install flake8\n   ```\n\n2. **Configure Vim**: Open your `~/.vimrc` or `init.vim` and add the following configuration:\n\n   ```vim\n   \" Create an augroup for Python settings\n   augroup python_pep8\n     autocmd!\n\n     \" Apply settings only to Python files\n     autocmd FileType python setlocal expandtab tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4 softtabstop=4\n     autocmd FileType python setlocal textwidth=79\n\n     \" Use flake8 for linting\n     autocmd FileType python let g:syntastic_python_checkers = ['flake8']\n   augroup END\n   ```\n\n3. **Autoformat with Black**: If you want to autoformat your Python code according to PEP 8, you can integrate `black`, a code formatter, into Vim. First, install `black`:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install black\n   ```\n\n   Then, add a keybinding to format your Python code:\n\n   ```vim\n   \" Keybinding for formatting with Black\n   autocmd FileType python nnoremap <silent> <leader>f :Black<CR>\n   ```\n\n   Note: You need to have the `vim-black` plugin installed for this to work. You can install it using a plugin manager like vim-plug:\n\n   ```vim\n   Plug 'psf/black', { 'branch': 'stable' }\n   ```\n\n4. **Install Syntastic or ALE**: To integrate `flake8` into Vim, you can use plugins like Syntastic or ALE for linting. For example, with vim-plug, you can add:\n\n   ```vim\n   \" Install Syntastic for linting\n   Plug 'vim-syntastic/syntastic'\n   ```\n\n   Or, for ALE:\n\n   ```vim\n   \" Install ALE for asynchronous linting\n   Plug 'dense-analysis/ale'\n   ```\n\n5. **Reload Vim**: After updating your configuration file, reload Vim or restart it to apply the changes.\n\nBy following these steps, you ensure that your Vim editor adheres to PEP 8 guidelines only when you're editing Python files, leaving configurations for other file types unchanged."
