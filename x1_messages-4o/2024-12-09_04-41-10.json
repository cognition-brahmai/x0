The script is as follows:\n\n```python\n#me == my email address\n#you == recipient's email address\nme = \"some.email@gmail.com\"\nyou = \"some_email2@gmail.com\"\n\n# Create message container - the correct MIME type is multipart/alternative.\nmsg = MIMEMultipart('alternative')\nmsg['Subject'] = \"Alert\"\nmsg['From'] = me\nmsg['To'] = you\n\n# Create the body of the message (a plain-text and an HTML version).\nhtml = '&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, I have the following alerts for you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;'\n\n# Record the MIME types of both parts - text/plain and text/html.\npart2 = MIMEText(html, 'html')\n\n# Attach parts into message container.\n# According to RFC 2046, the last part of a multipart message, in this case\n# the HTML message, is best and preferred.\nmsg.attach(part2)\n\n# Send the message via local SMTP server.\ns = smtplib.SMTP('aspmx.l.google.com')\n# sendmail function takes 3 arguments: sender's address, recipient's address\n# and message to send - here it is sent as one string.\ns.sendmail(me, you, msg.as_string())\ns.quit()\n```\n\nEarlier, my program didn't give me an error, but it also didn't send any emails. Now, Python is giving me the following error: \"SMTPServerDisconnected: Connection unexpectedly closed\". How can I fix this?"

        "content": "The error \"SMTPServerDisconnected: Connection unexpectedly closed\" indicates that the connection to the SMTP server was lost unexpectedly. There could be several reasons for this issue, and here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and fix the problem:\n\n1. **SMTP Server and Port**: Ensure you are connecting to the correct SMTP server and port. The server `aspmx.l.google.com` is typically used for receiving email (Google's MX server) and might not be the best choice for sending emails. For sending emails via Gmail, use `smtp.gmail.com` with port 587 or 465.\n\n2. **TLS/SSL Encryption**: If you're using `smtp.gmail.com`, you need to establish a secure connection using TLS or SSL. Here's how you can modify your script:\n\n   ```python\n   import smtplib\n   from email.mime.text import MIMEText\n   from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart\n\n   me = \"your_email@gmail.com\"\n   you = \"recipient_email@gmail.com\"\n   password = \"your_password\"  # Use an app password if you have 2FA enabled\n\n   msg = MIMEMultipart('alternative')\n   msg['Subject'] = \"Alert\"\n   msg['From'] = me\n   msg['To'] = you\n\n   html = '<html><body><p>Hi, I have the following alerts for you!</p></body></html>'\n   part2 = MIMEText(html, 'html')\n   msg.attach(part2)\n\n   # Connect to the server\n   s = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)\n   s.starttls()  # Upgrade the connection to a secure encrypted SSL/TLS connection\n   s.login(me, password)  # Login to the SMTP server\n\n   # Send the email\n   s.sendmail(me, you, msg.as_string())\n   s.quit()\n   ```\n\n3. **Authentication**: Ensure you are using the correct email and password. If you have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled on your Google account, use an app-specific password instead of your regular account password.\n\n4. **Less Secure Apps**: If you are not using 2FA, make sure that \"Allow less secure apps\" is enabled in your Google account settings. Note that this option may not be available if 2FA is enabled.\n\n5. **Firewall/Antivirus**: Ensure that your firewall or antivirus software is not blocking the SMTP connection.\n\n6. **Network Issues**: Check your network connection to ensure there are no issues preventing you from connecting to the SMTP server.\n\nIf after these steps you still encounter issues, consider checking the SMTP server logs or your email provider's support resources for more detailed troubleshooting."
