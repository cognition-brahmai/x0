        "content": "Creating CPU Flame Graphs for Python programs involves several steps, and extending the process to show both C and Python stacks, or even down to the kernel, requires a combination of tools and techniques. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to achieve this:\n\n### Step 1: Gather Stack Information\n\n1. **Use Python Profilers**:\n   - **cProfile**: A built-in Python profiler that provides function call statistics. You can use it to gather CPU time spent in Python code.\n     ```python\n     import cProfile\n     profiler = cProfile.Profile()\n     profiler.enable()\n     # Your code here\n     profiler.disable()\n     profiler.dump_stats('output.pstats')\n     ```\n\n2. **Pyflame**:\n   - Pyflame is a tool for generating flame graphs from Python programs. It's a ptracing profiler, which means it can attach to running Python processes.\n     ```bash\n     pyflame -p <pid> -o profile.txt\n     ```\n\n3. **Use eBPF/BCC Tools**:\n   - BCC (BPF Compiler Collection) includes several tools that can be used to gather stack traces from both user-space and kernel-space. One of these tools is `profile`, which can be used to sample stack traces at a fixed interval.\n     ```bash\n     sudo ./profile -F 99 -p <pid> -f -o profile.stacks\n     ```\n\n### Step 2: Create Flame Graphs\n\n1. **Use Flamegraph Scripts**:\n   - Brendan Gregg provides flamegraph scripts that can generate SVG flame graphs from stack data.\n     ```bash\n     git clone https://github.com/brendangregg/Flamegraph\n     cd Flamegraph\n     ./stackcollapse-perf.pl profile.stacks > out.folded\n     ./flamegraph.pl out.folded > flamegraph.svg\n     ```\n\n### Step 3: Extend to C and Kernel Stacks\n\n1. **Use `perf` for C and Kernel Stacks**:\n   - `perf` is a powerful Linux profiling tool that can be used to gather stack traces from both user-space and kernel-space.\n     ```bash\n     sudo perf record -F 99 -p <pid> -g -- sleep 30\n     sudo perf script > out.perf\n     ```\n\n2. **Process with Flamegraph Scripts**:\n   - Use the `stackcollapse-perf.pl` to collapse the `perf` output into a format suitable for generating flame graphs.\n     ```bash\n     ./stackcollapse-perf.pl out.perf > out.folded\n     ./flamegraph.pl out.folded > flamegraph.svg\n     ```\n\n### Step 4: Combine Python and C Stacks\n\n1. **Use Pyflame with `perf`**:\n   - First, run pyflame and perf simultaneously on the process. This will give you both Python stack traces and C/kernel stack traces.\n   - Combine the outputs, ensuring that the time intervals match up, and then generate a unified flame graph.\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- **Symbol Resolution**: Ensure that your binaries have symbols available for accurate stack traces, especially for C extensions.\n- **Frequency**: Adjust the sampling frequency (`-F`) to balance between performance overhead and detail level.\n- **Environment**: Make sure you have the necessary permissions and your environment is set up to run these tools, especially on production systems.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to create detailed flame graphs that capture the performance characteristics of your Python programs, including insights into C-level and kernel-level interactions."
