        "content": "To print a 5x5 two-dimensional array in the desired format in Python, you can follow these steps. Since you're aiming to represent \"infinity\" where necessary, it's helpful to define a representation for it, typically using `float('inf')`. Here's a complete code example to achieve your goal:\n\n```python\n# Define the 5x5 array with 'infinity' represented by float('inf')\nA = [\n    [0, 1, 4, float('inf'), 3],\n    [1, 0, 2, float('inf'), 4],\n    [4, 2, 0, 1, 5],\n    [float('inf'), float('inf'), 1, 0, 3],\n    [3, 4, 5, 3, 0]\n]\n\n# Function to print the array in the desired format\ndef print_array(array):\n    for row in array:\n        for value in row:\n            if value == float('inf'):\n                print('(infinity)', end=' ')\n            else:\n                print(value, end=' ')\n        print()  # Newline after each row\n\n# Print the array\nprint_array(A)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Array Initialization**: We create a 5x5 array named `A` where `float('inf')` is used to represent infinity.\n- **Printing Logic**: The `print_array` function iterates over each row and each value within the row. If a value is `float('inf')`, it prints `(infinity)`, otherwise, it prints the integer value.\n- **Formatting**: The `end=' '` in the `print` function ensures that values are printed on the same line with spaces in between. After printing each row, `print()` is called to move to the next line.\n\nThis code will output the array in the desired format, with `(infinity)` replacing `float('inf')`."
