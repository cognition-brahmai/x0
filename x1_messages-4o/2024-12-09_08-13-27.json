I understand that in Python, I could declare variables like 'x = 0', 'y = 0', and 'z = 0', but that seems like a lot of work and it doesn't retain the C-like format that I'm aiming for. What is the shortest way to declare these variables in Python, so my code looks as similar to C as possible?"

        "content": "In Python, you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of variables as you do in C because Python is dynamically typed. However, if you want to declare multiple variables in a concise manner that resembles the C syntax, you can initialize multiple variables in a single line like this:\n\n```python\nx, y, z = 0, 0, 0\n```\n\nThis line initializes `x`, `y`, and `z` to 0, which is similar to declaring them as integers in C. While this doesn't explicitly declare the type, it achieves the same effect as `int x, y, z;` in C by assigning them an initial integer value.\n\nIf you specifically want to emphasize the integer type in a way that mimics C, you can add a comment for clarity:\n\n```python\n# int x, y, z\nx, y, z = 0, 0, 0\n```\n\nThis way, you maintain readability and a C-like format while adhering to Python's syntax and dynamic typing."
