I attempted to do this using the following code:\n\n```python\nplt.gca().set_xticks([])\nplt.xticks([])\nax.set_xticks([])\n```\nHowever, although the grid disappears, small ticks (at the place of the main ticks) still remain. How can I completely remove them?"

        "content": "To completely remove the xticks, including the small ticks, you can use the `set_xticks` method with an empty list on the Axes object and also set the minor ticks to an empty list. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Sample data\nx = np.linspace(0.1, 10, 100)\ny = np.sin(x)\n\n# Create a semilogx plot\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.semilogx(x, y)\n\n# Remove all xticks\nax.set_xticks([])            # Remove major xticks\nax.set_xticks([], minor=True) # Remove minor xticks\n\n# Optionally, also remove x-axis tick labels\nax.xaxis.set_ticklabels([])\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis code ensures that both major and minor xticks are removed from your plot. The `minor=True` part addresses the minor ticks specifically, which are often present on log-scaled axes."
