However, when I attempt to do this using `DateTimeField` in my `models.py` and `views.py` files, I get an error stating that `objects_object.created_at may not be NULL`. Do I have to manually set this value myself? If so, what is the best way to do this? Would an `__init__` method be appropriate?\n\nHere is the code I have tried so far:\n\n`models.py`:\n\n```python\ncreated_at = models.DateTimeField(False, True, editable=False)\nupdated_at = models.DateTimeField(True, True, editable=False)\n```\n\n`views.py`:\n\n```python\nif request.method == 'POST':\n    form = MyForm(request.POST)\n    if form.is_valid():\n        obj = form.save(commit=False)\n        obj.user = request.user\n        obj.save()\n        return HttpResponseRedirect('obj_list')\n```"

        "content": "To automatically set a creation date and record when an object was last updated in your Django model, you can leverage the `auto_now` and `auto_now_add` attributes of `DateTimeField`. These attributes handle setting the date and time automatically without you having to manually assign them.\n\nHere's how you can set it up in your `models.py`:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True, editable=False)\n    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True, editable=False)\n\n    # Other fields for your model\n```\n\n- `auto_now_add=True`: This sets the field to the current date and time when the object is first created. It will not change on subsequent updates.\n- `auto_now=True`: This updates the field to the current date and time every time the object is saved.\n\nWith this setup, you don't need to manually set these fields in your `views.py`. The Django ORM will handle it for you. Your current code in `views.py` should work fine without requiring additional changes regarding these fields:\n\n```python\nif request.method == 'POST':\n    form = MyForm(request.POST)\n    if form.is_valid():\n        obj = form.save(commit=False)\n        obj.user = request.user\n        obj.save()\n        return HttpResponseRedirect('obj_list')\n```\n\nMake sure your database schema is up to date by running `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate` after making these changes to your model.\n\nIf you still encounter the `may not be NULL` error, ensure that your database is in sync with your models and that there are no existing rows with `NULL` values for these fields. You may need to set default values or handle existing data during migration."
