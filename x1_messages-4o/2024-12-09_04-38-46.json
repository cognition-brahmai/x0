After each guess, my opponent tells me how many of the colours I guessed were the right colour in the right place [\"blacks\"] and how many were the right colour but in the wrong place [\"whites\"]. The game ends when I guess correctly (4 blacks, 0 whites). What algorithm would be most efficient, effective, clear, concise, flexible and general for such a puzzle?"

        "content": "Creating an efficient algorithm to solve the \"Mastermind\" game involves a strategic approach to minimize the number of guesses needed to deduce the correct sequence. Here's a step-by-step explanation of an algorithm known as the \"Five-Guess Algorithm,\" developed by Donald Knuth, which is both efficient and effective:\n\n### 1. Initial Setup\n\n- Define the set of possible colors: `colors = [\"yellow\", \"blue\", \"green\", \"red\", \"orange\", \"purple\"]`.\n- Generate all possible combinations of these colors in sequences of four. This results in `6^4 = 1,296` possible combinations.\n\n### 2. First Guess\n\n- Start with an initial guess. A common choice is `[\"red\", \"red\", \"blue\", \"blue\"]`. This is arbitrary but provides a good starting point.\n\n### 3. Feedback Mechanism\n\n- After each guess, you will receive feedback in the form of \"blacks\" and \"whites\".\n  - **Blacks**: Number of pegs that are the correct color in the correct position.\n  - **Whites**: Number of pegs that are the correct color but in the wrong position.\n\n### 4. Reducing Possibilities\n\n- Use the feedback to eliminate impossible combinations. For each remaining possible combination, simulate the feedback it would produce against your guess.\n- Keep only those combinations that would give the same feedback if they were the secret code.\n\n### 5. Next Guess Selection\n\n- For each possible next guess (from the remaining possible solutions), calculate how many possibilities it would eliminate in the worst-case scenario.\n- Choose the guess that minimizes the maximum number of remaining possibilities. This is a minimax approach.\n\n### 6. Repeat\n\n- Make the next guess based on the step above and receive feedback.\n- Continue reducing possibilities and selecting new guesses until you achieve 4 blacks (correct answer).\n\n### 7. Implementation\n\nTo implement the algorithm, you can use the following pseudo-code:\n\n```pseudo\ninitialize all possible combinations\nguess = [\"red\", \"red\", \"blue\", \"blue\"]\n\nwhile true:\n    feedback = get_feedback(guess)\n    if feedback == [4, 0]:\n        break\n    eliminate possibilities that don't match feedback\n    guess = select_next_guess(possibilities)\n```\n\n### 8. Optimization\n\n- Implement a scoring system to quickly assess and choose the best guess.\n- Optimize data structures for quickly accessing and eliminating possibilities (e.g., using sets or dictionaries).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nKnuth's algorithm guarantees a solution in five or fewer guesses. It employs a systematic approach to reduce possibilities and strategically select guesses, ensuring efficiency and effectiveness. Adapting this algorithm with optimizations for data handling can provide a very robust solution to the Mastermind game."
