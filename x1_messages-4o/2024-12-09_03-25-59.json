        "content": "In Python, the `logging` module is highly configurable, allowing you to determine where and how log messages are output. By default, if you haven't configured any handlers, your log messages will not be stored in a file. Instead, they'll typically be output to the console, specifically to `stderr`.\n\nHere's a breakdown of your code and how you can control where the logs go:\n\n1. **Default Behavior**: \n   - When you call `log.info('Test')`, the message is sent to the root logger, which by default is configured to output to the console. If you don't have any handlers explicitly set up, the log messages won't be stored in a file.\n\n2. **Using `logging.getLogger(__name__)`**:\n   - The `logging.getLogger(__name__)` function gets or creates a logger with the name of the current module (`__name__`). This means that each module can have its own logger, which can be useful for organizing logs from different parts of an application.\n   - Using `__name__` as the logger name allows the logging configuration to apply different settings to different parts of your application based on the module name.\n\n3. **Configuring Log File Output**:\n   - To store logs in a file, you need to add a `FileHandler` to the logger. Here's an example of how to send logs to a file:\n\n     ```python\n     import logging\n\n     # Create a logger with the module's name\n     log = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n     # Set the logging level (optional, default is WARNING)\n     log.setLevel(logging.INFO)\n\n     # Create a file handler to write logs to a file\n     file_handler = logging.FileHandler('app.log')\n     # Create a logging format (optional)\n     formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n     file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\n     # Add the file handler to the logger\n     log.addHandler(file_handler)\n\n     # Log a message\n     log.info('Test')\n     ```\n\n   - In this example, logs will be stored in a file named `app.log` in the current working directory. You can specify a different path if needed.\n\n4. **Multiple Handlers**:\n   - You can add multiple handlers to the same logger if you want to log messages to multiple destinations (e.g., both console and file). Just create and add additional handlers like `FileHandler` and `StreamHandler`.\n\nBy configuring handlers and formatters, you can have complete control over where your log messages are sent and how they are formatted."
