        "content": "The behavior you're observing with the `os.system()` function in Python is due to how the function works.\n\nWhen you execute the command `x = os.system(\"whoami\")`, the `os.system()` function runs the command specified in a subshell. The return value of `os.system()` is the exit status code of the command executed. In Unix-like systems, an exit status of `0` typically means that the command was executed successfully.\n\nSo, when you run `os.system(\"whoami\")`, it prints the output of the `whoami` command (which is `root` in your case, meaning you are running the script as the root user) to the standard output (the console), and the function returns `0` to indicate that the command completed successfully. That's why the variable `x` is set to `0`.\n\nIf you want to capture the output of the command instead of the exit status, you can use the `subprocess` module, which provides more powerful facilities for spawning new processes and retrieving their results. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\nresult = subprocess.run([\"whoami\"], capture_output=True, text=True)\nx = result.stdout.strip()\nprint(x)\n```\n\nIn this example, `x` would contain the string `root` if the command is executed by the root user. The `capture_output=True` parameter captures the standard output of the command, and `text=True` ensures that the output is returned as a string instead of bytes."
