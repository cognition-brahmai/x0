        "content": "In Python, there isn't a direct equivalent to Groovy's safe navigation operator (`?.`), but you can achieve similar functionality in a few different ways. One common approach is using a conditional expression (also known as a ternary operator) or the `if` statement. However, Python 3.8 introduced the \"walrus operator\" (`:=`), which can make this process a bit cleaner in some cases.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can handle this situation:\n\n1. **Using an `if` statement:**\n\n   ```python\n   if variable is not None:\n       variable.method()\n   ```\n\n2. **Using a ternary-like expression:**\n\n   ```python\n   result = variable.method() if variable is not None else None\n   ```\n\n3. **Using the \"walrus operator\" (Python 3.8+):**\n\n   This can be useful if you want to both check for `None` and use the result in an expression:\n\n   ```python\n   if (result := variable) is not None:\n       result.method()\n   ```\n\n4. **Using a try-except block:**\n\n   If you're expecting that calling a method on `None` might be rare and want to handle it gracefully:\n\n   ```python\n   try:\n       variable.method()\n   except AttributeError:\n       pass  # or handle the error in some way\n   ```\n\nThese methods give you flexibility in handling potential `None` values without directly having a safe navigation operator like Groovy's `?.`."
