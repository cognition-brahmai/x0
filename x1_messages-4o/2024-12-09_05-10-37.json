I am working on a scatter plot with the following code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nnp.random.seed(5)\nx = np.arange(1, 101)\ny = 20 + 3 * x + np.random.normal(0, 60, 100)\np =  plot(x, y, \"o\")\n```\nThis generates a plot for me. Now, I am looking to add some annotation lines to this existing graph. I am unsure of how to render these lines on the graph. Specifically, I want to add a vertical line from (70,100) up to (70,250) and a diagonal line from (70,100) to (90,200). I have tried using the `Line2D()` function but it only led to confusion. In `R` I would use the `segments()` function to add line segments. Is there an equivalent in `matplotlib`?"

        "content": "To add lines to your scatter plot in Matplotlib, you can use the `axvline` for vertical lines and `plot` for diagonal or arbitrary lines. Here's how you can add both a vertical line from (70, 100) to (70, 250) and a diagonal line from (70, 100) to (90, 200) to your plot:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Seed for reproducibility\nnp.random.seed(5)\n\n# Data\nx = np.arange(1, 101)\ny = 20 + 3 * x + np.random.normal(0, 60, 100)\n\n# Create the plot\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(x, y, \"o\")\n\n# Add a vertical line from (70, 100) to (70, 250)\nax.vlines(x=70, ymin=100, ymax=250, color='red', linestyle='--')\n\n# Add a diagonal line from (70, 100) to (90, 200)\nax.plot([70, 90], [100, 200], color='blue', linestyle='-')\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Vertical Line**: We use `ax.vlines()` to draw a vertical line. Here, `x=70` specifies the x-coordinate of the vertical line, `ymin=100` and `ymax=250` specify the start and end y-coordinates, respectively. You can customize the color and style with `color` and `linestyle`.\n\n- **Diagonal Line**: We use `ax.plot()` to draw a line between two points. The first list `[70, 90]` specifies the x-coordinates, and the second list `[100, 200]` specifies the corresponding y-coordinates of the line. Again, you can customize the appearance with `color` and `linestyle`.\n\nThese methods allow you to add lines to your plot effectively, similar to how you might use `segments()` in R."
