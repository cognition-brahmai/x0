When I lint my code with Pylint, I receive this error message: \"R0902: too-many-instance-attributes (8/7)\". I understand the rationale behind limiting the number of instance attributes, but seven seems a bit low. In my code:\n\n```python\ndef __init__(self, output_file=None, output_dir=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Set the frobnicator up, along with default geometries\n    \"\"\"\n\n    self.margin = 30\n\n    self.pos = [0, 0]\n    self.sep = [5, 5]\n\n    self.cell = [20, 20]\n\n    self.frobbr = library.Frobbr()\n\n    page = self.frobbr.get_settings('page')\n\n    self.lim = [page.get_width() - self.margin,\n                page.get_height() - self.margin]\n\n    self.filename = output_file\n    self.moddir = output_dir\n```\n\nShould I package the geometries up into a dict, or do something else to stop Pylint complaining? I don't really want to just ignore it."

        "content": "The \"too-many-instance-attributes\" warning from Pylint is a guideline to encourage cleaner, more maintainable code by suggesting that classes should not have too many attributes. While seven is the default threshold set by Pylint, it's not always appropriate for every scenario. Here are a few strategies to address this issue:\n\n1. **Group Related Attributes**: If some of the attributes are closely related, consider grouping them into a separate class or a dictionary. For example, if `pos`, `sep`, `cell`, and `lim` are related to geometry, you might create a separate class for these:\n\n   ```python\n   class Geometry:\n       def __init__(self, pos, sep, cell, lim):\n           self.pos = pos\n           self.sep = sep\n           self.cell = cell\n           self.lim = lim\n\n   class YourClass:\n       def __init__(self, output_file=None, output_dir=None):\n           self.margin = 30\n           self.geometry = Geometry(pos=[0, 0], sep=[5, 5], cell=[20, 20], lim=self.calculate_lim())\n           self.frobbr = library.Frobbr()\n           self.filename = output_file\n           self.moddir = output_dir\n\n       def calculate_lim(self):\n           page = self.frobbr.get_settings('page')\n           return [page.get_width() - self.margin, page.get_height() - self.margin]\n   ```\n\n2. **Consider Attributes Necessity**: Evaluate if all attributes are necessary as instance attributes. Could some be calculated on the fly or stored temporarily during method execution?\n\n3. **Configuration Object**: If attributes are configuration-related, consider using a configuration object or dictionary to store them, especially if you don't perform a lot of operations on them.\n\n4. **Refactor Logic**: If your class has multiple responsibilities, consider breaking it down into smaller classes. Each class should ideally have a single responsibility.\n\n5. **Increase Pylint Threshold**: If you believe more attributes are justified, you can increase the threshold for this rule by adding a comment at the top of your class:\n\n   ```python\n   # pylint: disable=too-many-instance-attributes\n   ```\n\n   Or, you can adjust the threshold globally in your Pylint configuration file (`.pylintrc`):\n\n   ```ini\n   [MASTER]\n   max-attributes=10\n   ```\n\n   However, this should be done judiciously and as a last resort after considering refactoring options.\n\nBy following these strategies, you can manage the complexity of your class while adhering to good coding practices."
