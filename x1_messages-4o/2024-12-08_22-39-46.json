You can also use the SoilWeb API to get soil data for your location.\nHere's an example Ruby code:\nrequire 'geocoder'\nrequire 'forecast_io'\nrequire 'soilweb_client'\naddress = \"123 Main St, Anytown USA\"\ncoordinates = Geocoder.coordinates(address)\nlatitude = coordinates[0]\nlongitude = coordinates[1]\nForecastIO.api_key = \"your_forecast_io_api_key\"\nforecast = ForecastIO.forecast(latitude, longitude)\nsoil = SoilwebClient.get_soil(latitude, longitude)\n# Analyze data and output recommended planting location."

        "content": "To complete the task of determining the optimal location for planting a crimson-colored rosebush, you can follow this approach using the suggested libraries and APIs. Here's a more detailed explanation and an expanded version of the Ruby code:\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation\n\n1. **Get Coordinates:**\n   - Use the `Geocoder` gem to convert your garden's address into latitude and longitude coordinates.\n\n2. **Fetch Weather Forecast:**\n   - Use the `Forecast` gem with your API key to get the weather forecast for your garden location. This helps in understanding sunlight exposure and potential weather conditions.\n\n3. **Access Soil Data:**\n   - Use the `SoilWeb` API to retrieve soil data, which is crucial for understanding the suitability of the soil for planting a rosebush.\n\n4. **Analyze and Determine Optimal Location:**\n   - Based on the gathered data, analyze factors like sunlight exposure, soil pH, moisture levels, and other relevant conditions to recommend the best planting spot.\n\n### Example Ruby Code\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'geocoder'\nrequire 'forecast_io'\nrequire 'soilweb_client'\n\n# Step 1: Get Coordinates\naddress = \"123 Main St, Anytown USA\"\ncoordinates = Geocoder.coordinates(address)\nlatitude, longitude = coordinates\n\n# Step 2: Fetch Weather Forecast\nForecastIO.api_key = \"your_forecast_io_api_key\"\nforecast = ForecastIO.forecast(latitude, longitude)\n\n# Step 3: Access Soil Data\nsoil_data = SoilwebClient.get_soil(latitude, longitude)\n\n# Step 4: Analyze Data\ndef analyze_planting_location(forecast, soil_data)\n  # Example conditions (you may need to adjust based on actual data attributes)\n  sunlight_hours = forecast.daily.data.map { |day| day.sunriseTime && day.sunsetTime }\n  soil_ph = soil_data['properties']['ph']\n\n  # Determine optimal location based on ideal conditions for rosebushes\n  ideal_sunlight_hours = 6..8\n  ideal_soil_ph = 6.0..6.8\n\n  if ideal_sunlight_hours.cover?(sunlight_hours) && ideal_soil_ph.cover?(soil_ph)\n    puts \"The location is optimal for planting the crimson-colored rosebush.\"\n  else\n    puts \"Consider adjusting conditions or choosing another location.\"\n  end\nend\n\n# Call the analysis function\nanalyze_planting_location(forecast, soil_data)\n```\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- **API Keys:** Ensure you have valid API keys for both Forecast.io and SoilWeb.\n- **Data Attributes:** Adjust the data extraction and analysis to fit the actual attributes and structure of the data returned by the APIs.\n- **Customization:** You may need to customize the conditions and thresholds based on specific requirements for the rosebush variety you intend to plant.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided code, you can effectively determine a suitable location for planting a rosebush in your garden."
