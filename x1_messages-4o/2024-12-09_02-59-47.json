The error message being displayed is \"socket.error: [Errno 111] Connection refused\". The error trace shows that the issue arises when the function cs.connect((HOST, 36258)) is called. Despite searching on Google and Stack Overflow, I haven't found a solution. Could you help me resolve this issue?\n\nHere is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport socket\n\ndef transferFile(fname):\n   HOST = '127.0.0.1'\n   CPORT = 36258\n   MPORT = 36250\n   FILE = fname\n   cs = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n   cs.connect((HOST, 36258))\n   cs.send(\"SEND \" + FILE)\n   cs.close()\n   ms = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n   ms.connect((HOST, MPORT))\n   f = open(FILE, \"rb\")\n   data = f.read()\n   f.close()\n   ms.send(data)\n   ms.close()\n\ndef uploadFiles(directory):\n   home = os.getenv(\"HOME\")\n   folder = str(home + \"/\" + directory)\n   os.chdir(folder)\n   dirList = os.listdir(folder)\n   print dirList\n   for fname in dirList:\n       if fname.endswith('.bin'):\n           transferFile(fname)\n\nos.chdir(os.getenv(\"HOME\"))\ndirectory = \"testdownload\"\nif not os.path.exists(directory):\n   os.makedirs(directory)\nos.chdir(directory)\n\nuploadFiles(directory)\n```"

        "content": "The \"Connection refused\" error typically means that the client is trying to connect to a server that is not currently listening on the specified IP address and port. Here are some possible reasons and solutions for this issue:\n\n1. **Server Not Running**: Ensure that your server program is running and actively listening on the specified IP address and port (36258). If the server is not running, the client will not be able to connect.\n\n2. **Incorrect IP or Port**: Verify that the IP address and port number on both the client and server match. In your case, you are using `127.0.0.1`, which refers to the localhost. Ensure that the server is also using the same IP address and port number for listening.\n\n3. **Firewall or Security Software**: Check if there is any firewall or security software blocking the connection on port 36258. You may need to allow the connection for that port in your firewall settings.\n\n4. **Server Binding Issues**: Ensure that the server is properly binding to the correct IP and port. Here's a simple example of how a server might be set up to listen on a port:\n\n   ```python\n   import socket\n\n   def start_server():\n       HOST = '127.0.0.1'\n       PORT = 36258\n       server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n       server_socket.bind((HOST, PORT))\n       server_socket.listen(5)\n       print(f\"Server listening on {HOST}:{PORT}\")\n       while True:\n           conn, addr = server_socket.accept()\n           print(f\"Connected by {addr}\")\n           data = conn.recv(1024)\n           if not data:\n               break\n           print(f\"Received: {data}\")\n           conn.close()\n\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       start_server()\n   ```\n\n5. **Ensure Correct Order of Operations**: Make sure your server is running and set up to listen before you attempt to connect with the client.\n\n6. **Port Already in Use**: Check if the port is already in use by another application. You can do this by running a command like `netstat` or `lsof` on Unix-based systems to see if the port is occupied.\n\n7. **Network Configuration**: If you are running the client and server on different machines, ensure that they are on the same network and can reach each other. This might involve checking network settings and ensuring that no network restrictions are in place.\n\nBy addressing these points, you should be able to resolve the \"Connection refused\" error. If you continue to have trouble, consider adding some debugging output to both the client and server to gain more insight into where the process is failing."
