I'm using the mock library for some unit tests and it fails to import wraps. I'm not using any virtual environments. The versions of mock and six that I'm using are 1.1.3 and 1.9.0 respectively. When I try to import Mock from the mock module or wraps from the six module, I get the following error:\n\n```python\n>>> from mock import Mock\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mock/__init__.py\", line 2, in <module>\n    import mock.mock as _mock\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mock/mock.py\", line 68, in <module>\n    from six import wraps\nImportError: cannot import name wraps\n```\nEven using sudo doesn't solve the problem:\n\n```bash\n$ sudo python -c 'from six import wraps'\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\nImportError: cannot import name wraps\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering indicates that the `six` module does not have a `wraps` function available for import. The `six` library is a Python 2 and 3 compatibility library, and it does not define a `wraps` function. Instead, `wraps` is typically found in the `functools` module, which is part of the Python standard library.\n\nHere's how you can troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Your `mock` Version**: Ensure that you're using a compatible version of the `mock` library. Some versions of `mock` may have incorrect imports. You mentioned using version 1.1.3, which should be compatible with Python 2.7, but ensure you have the correct version by updating it.\n\n2. **Update Your `six` Library**: You may want to update the `six` library to the latest version available for Python 2.7. Run the following command to update it:\n   ```bash\n   sudo pip install --upgrade six\n   ```\n\n3. **Check the `mock` Implementation**: The issue might be with how the `mock` library is trying to import `wraps`. You can check the `mock` library's source code in `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mock/mock.py` around the line where it tries to import `wraps`. It might be an incorrect import statement.\n\n4. **Use `functools.wraps`**: If you have control over the code and it's mistakenly importing `wraps` from `six`, you can modify it to use:\n   ```python\n   from functools import wraps\n   ```\n\n5. **Reinstall the Libraries**: Sometimes, reinstalling the libraries can help resolve such issues:\n   ```bash\n   sudo pip uninstall mock six\n   sudo pip install mock six\n   ```\n\n6. **Check for Conflicting Packages**: Ensure there are no other packages or files named `six` or `mock` that could be causing conflicts.\n\nBy addressing these points, you should be able to resolve the `ImportError` and successfully import the necessary modules for your unit tests."
