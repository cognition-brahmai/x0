For example, I'm using rpy2 and have some time-consuming work that needs to be done when the module/class is first imported. This functionality depends on a variable that needs to be passed in. This operation only needs to be done when the module/class is loaded and all instances of the class can then use the result. Here's the code I'm currently working with:\n\n```python\nimport rpy2.robjects as robjects\n\nPATH_TO_R_SOURCE = ## I need to pass this\nrobjects.r.source(PATH_TO_R_SOURCE, chdir = True) ## this takes time\n\nclass SomeClass:\n  def __init__(self, aCurve):\n    self._curve = aCurve\n\n  def processCurve(self):\n    robjects.r['someRFunc'](robjects.FloatVector(self._curve))\n```\n\nAm I stuck creating a module-level function that I call to do the work as shown below?\n\n```python\nimport someClass\nsomeClass.sourceRStuff(PATH_TO_R_SOURCE)\nx = someClass.SomeClass([1,2,3,4])\netc...\n```"

        "content": "To achieve this, you can use a more Pythonic approach by employing a module-level function or a class method to handle the initialization logic that depends on external variables. Here's how you can structure your code to pass a variable when importing or initializing a module:\n\n1. **Create a Setup Function or Method:** Create a function or class method that initializes the module with the required variable. This function should be called before using other functionalities of the module.\n\n2. **Use a Singleton Pattern:** If you want to ensure that the initialization is done only once, you can use a singleton pattern to store the initialization state.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport rpy2.robjects as robjects\n\nclass SomeClass:\n    _initialized = False\n\n    @classmethod\n    def initialize(cls, path_to_r_source):\n        if not cls._initialized:\n            robjects.r.source(path_to_r_source, chdir=True)\n            cls._initialized = True\n\n    def __init__(self, aCurve):\n        if not SomeClass._initialized:\n            raise RuntimeError(\"SomeClass is not initialized. Call SomeClass.initialize() first.\")\n        self._curve = aCurve\n\n    def processCurve(self):\n        robjects.r['someRFunc'](robjects.FloatVector(self._curve))\n\n# Usage example\nSomeClass.initialize('/path/to/r/source')\nx = SomeClass([1, 2, 3, 4])\nx.processCurve()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Initialization Method:** The `initialize` method ensures that the R source is loaded only once, and it sets a flag `_initialized` to avoid redundant initialization.\n\n- **Safety Check in Constructor:** The constructor of `SomeClass` checks whether the class is initialized and raises an error if it's not, ensuring that users of the class do not forget to call `initialize`.\n\n- **Singleton Pattern:** This pattern is used to ensure that the initialization logic is executed only once. You can adapt this pattern further if needed, e.g., by using a separate singleton object for more complex state management.\n\nThis approach allows you to separate the initialization logic from the class instantiation and ensures that your module is properly configured before use."
