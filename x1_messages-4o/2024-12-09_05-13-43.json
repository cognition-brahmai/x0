I use a for loop for plotting like this:\n\n```python\nfor key in dict.keys():\n    plot(x,dict[key], label = key)\ngraph.legend()\n```\n\nHowever, I noticed that this approach repeats a lot of colors in the legend. How can I ensure that a unique color is assigned to each line when using matplotlib, especially when there are over 20 lines?"

        "content": "When plotting multiple lines with `matplotlib`, the default color cycle might not have enough distinct colors to cover all your lines, resulting in repeated colors. To ensure each line has a unique color, you can use a colormap to generate a set of distinct colors. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Assuming x and dict are defined\nx = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)\ndict = {f'line_{i}': np.sin(x + i) for i in range(20)}\n\n# Generate a colormap with a number of colors matching the number of lines\nnum_lines = len(dict)\ncolors = plt.cm.viridis(np.linspace(0, 1, num_lines))\n\n# Plot each line with a unique color\nfor i, (key, value) in enumerate(dict.items()):\n    plt.plot(x, value, label=key, color=colors[i])\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Colormap**: The `plt.cm.viridis` function is used to generate a colormap. You can choose different colormaps such as `plt.cm.jet`, `plt.cm.plasma`, `plt.cm.cool`, etc., depending on your preference.\n\n2. **Color Assignment**: By using `np.linspace(0, 1, num_lines)`, you generate evenly spaced values between 0 and 1, which are then used to sample from the colormap, ensuring that each line gets a unique color.\n\n3. **Plotting**: The `enumerate` function is used to iterate over the dictionary items, allowing you to use the index `i` to select a color from the `colors` array for each line.\n\nThis approach helps you to have a visually distinct color for each of your lines, improving the readability of your plot."
