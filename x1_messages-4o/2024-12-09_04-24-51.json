        "content": "Yes, there are a few extensions and plugins available for Visual Studio Code that can assist with auto-importing Python modules. Here are some popular ones:\n\n1. **Python by Microsoft**: This is the official Python extension for Visual Studio Code. While it doesn't automatically add imports as you type, it provides IntelliSense and can suggest imports. It can help with auto-completion and will sometimes suggest imports for unresolved symbols.\n\n2. **Pyright**: Developed by Microsoft, Pyright is a static type checker for Python. It provides type checking and also has features for code navigation and auto-import suggestions.\n\n3. **Jedi**: Jedi is a static analysis tool for Python that can be used in various editors, including VS Code. It doesn't directly auto-import but enhances auto-completion and can help with imports.\n\n4. **Auto Import**: This is an extension that provides automatic import suggestions. It\u2019s specifically designed to add missing imports automatically.\n\n5. **TabNine**: While not specific to imports, TabNine is an AI-powered autocompletion tool that can enhance your coding experience and sometimes suggest relevant imports based on context.\n\n6. **Python Import Sorter**: This extension helps in sorting and organizing imports, which can indirectly make managing imports easier.\n\nTo enable and configure these extensions, you can go to the Extensions Marketplace in Visual Studio Code and search for them by name. Make sure to check the documentation for each extension, as they might require specific configurations to work optimally in your development environment."
