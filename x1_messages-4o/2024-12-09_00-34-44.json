I have already installed Python 3.6 and `pipenv` in a 'robot' directory. However, when I start the shell and open Python, it shows version Python 3.5.3. I tried changing the virtual environment using `pipenv --python 3.6`, but I got a warning that `pipenv` still expects Python 3.5. Is there a way to do this without manually editing the Pipfile?"

        "content": "Certainly! When you're setting up a Python virtual environment with `pipenv`, it's important to ensure that `pipenv` recognizes the correct Python version you intend to use. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you configure `pipenv` to use Python 3.6:\n\n1. **Verify Python 3.6 Installation**: First, ensure that Python 3.6 is installed and accessible in your system's PATH. You can verify this by running:\n   ```sh\n   python3.6 --version\n   ```\n   This should output something like `Python 3.6.x`.\n\n2. **Install pipenv**: Make sure that `pipenv` is installed for the correct version of Python. If you haven't already specified Python 3.6 during pipenv installation, you can do this by:\n   ```sh\n   python3.6 -m pip install pipenv\n   ```\n\n3. **Create Virtual Environment**: Navigate to your project directory where you want to set up the virtual environment and run:\n   ```sh\n   pipenv --python 3.6\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify the Creation**: After running the command, `pipenv` should create a virtual environment using Python 3.6. To verify the Python version in the virtual environment:\n   ```sh\n   pipenv shell\n   python --version\n   ```\n   This should output `Python 3.6.x`.\n\n5. **Check the Pipfile**: After creating the environment, `pipenv` will generate a `Pipfile` in your project directory. Open the `Pipfile` and ensure that it specifies Python 3.6:\n   ```toml\n   [requires]\n   python_version = \"3.6\"\n   ```\n\n6. **Resolve Conflicts**: If you still encounter warnings or issues, it may be due to cached virtual environments. You can clear them by removing the `.venv` directory within your project or by using:\n   ```sh\n   pipenv --rm\n   ```\n   Then, recreate the environment with:\n   ```sh\n   pipenv --python 3.6\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, `pipenv` should correctly recognize and use Python 3.6 for your project. If you continue to experience issues, ensure that your PATH and environment variables are correctly set up to prioritize Python 3.6 over other versions."
