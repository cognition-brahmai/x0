        "content": "How can I open an IPython notebook without the output? I have an IPython notebook where I've accidentally dumped a huge output (around 15 MB) that causes the notebook to crash. Whenever I try to open the notebook and delete the cell causing the problem, it crashes again. This prevents me from fixing the issue and restoring the notebook's stability. I am considering manually pasting the input cells to a new notebook. But, is there a way to just open the notebook without any outputs?"

        "content": "Yes, you can open an IPython (Jupyter) notebook without outputs by manually editing the notebook file, which is in JSON format. Here are the steps to do this:\n\n1. **Make a Backup**: First, make a copy of your notebook file as a backup, just in case anything goes wrong.\n\n2. **Open the Notebook File**: Use a text editor to open the `.ipynb` file. Since it's a JSON file, you can use any text editor like Notepad++ (Windows), Sublime Text, or VSCode which can handle large files and provide formatting for JSON.\n\n3. **Locate the Output Sections**: Search for the `\"outputs\"` key in the JSON structure. Each cell that has output will have an `\"outputs\"` array within it.\n\n4. **Remove the Outputs**: You can remove the entire `\"outputs\"` array along with its contents for each cell. You should also look for `\"execution_count\"` and set it to `null` or remove it if you prefer.\n\n   Here's a basic example:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"cell_type\": \"code\",\n     \"execution_count\": null,\n     \"metadata\": {},\n     \"outputs\": [],\n     \"source\": [\n       \"print('Hello, World!')\"\n     ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. **Save the File**: Once you've removed all output entries, save the file.\n\n6. **Open the Notebook**: Now, try opening the notebook again in Jupyter. It should load without the outputs, allowing you to edit and run the cells as needed.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to open your notebook without the outputs causing it to crash. If you have many output cells, using a script to automate the removal might also be a good idea."
