However, I've encountered an issue where it appears that I can only save up to 5 models. Here is a sample of my code:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf \n\nx = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]))\nsaver = tf.train.Saver()\nsess = tf.Session()\n\nfor i in range(10):\n  sess.run(tf.initialize_all_variables())\n  saver.save( sess, '/home/eneskocabey/Desktop/model' + str(i) )\n```\n\nWhen I execute this code, only 5 models appear on my Desktop. Can anyone explain why this is happening and how I can save more than 5 models using the same `tf.train.Saver()` constructor?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely due to the default behavior of `tf.train.Saver()` in TensorFlow, which keeps only the last 5 checkpoints by default. This is controlled by the `max_to_keep` parameter of the `Saver` constructor. By default, `max_to_keep` is set to 5, meaning it retains only the last 5 checkpoints and deletes older ones.\n\nTo save more checkpoints, you need to explicitly set the `max_to_keep` parameter to a higher value when creating the `Saver` object. Here's how you can modify your code to keep all of your checkpoints:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf \n\nx = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]))\nsaver = tf.train.Saver(max_to_keep=10)  # Set max_to_keep to 10 or any number you need\nsess = tf.Session()\n\nfor i in range(10):\n    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())  # Updated to tf.global_variables_initializer()\n    saver.save(sess, '/home/eneskocabey/Desktop/model' + str(i))\n```\n\nAdditionally, make sure you are using the correct initializer. In more recent versions of TensorFlow, `tf.global_variables_initializer()` is used instead of `tf.initialize_all_variables()`. This will initialize all the variables in the graph.\n\nBy setting `max_to_keep=10`, you will be able to save all 10 models as you intended. If you need to save even more models, you can increase this number accordingly."
