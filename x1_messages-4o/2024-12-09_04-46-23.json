        "content": "The error you're encountering, `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`, suggests that the issue is not with the line `aTargetDictionary[aKey] = []` directly, but rather that somewhere in your code, you might be trying to use a list as a dictionary key, which is not allowed in Python since lists are mutable and therefore unhashable.\n\nThe code snippet you provided should work correctly as it stands if `aSourceDictionary` is structured as you described (with strings as keys and lists of custom objects as values). However, to ensure everything is working as expected, here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and fix the issue:\n\n1. **Check the Source Dictionary:** Ensure that `aSourceDictionary` is indeed a dictionary with strings as keys. You can do this by printing out the keys and types:\n\n    ```python\n    for key in aSourceDictionary:\n        print(f\"Key: {key}, Type: {type(key)}\")\n    ```\n\n2. **Verify No Lists as Keys:** Ensure there are no instances where you might have mistakenly used lists as keys elsewhere in your code.\n\n3. **Simplified Example:** Here's a simple example to demonstrate how this should work without errors:\n\n    ```python\n    class CustomObject:\n        def __init__(self, value):\n            self.value = value\n\n    # Example source dictionary\n    aSourceDictionary = {\n        'key1': [CustomObject(1), CustomObject(2)],\n        'key2': [CustomObject(3)],\n    }\n\n    # Target dictionary\n    aTargetDictionary = {}\n\n    for aKey in aSourceDictionary:\n        aTargetDictionary[aKey] = []\n        aTargetDictionary[aKey].extend(aSourceDictionary[aKey])\n\n    # Verify target dictionary\n    for key, objects in aTargetDictionary.items():\n        print(f\"{key}: {[obj.value for obj in objects]}\")\n    ```\n\n4. **Debugging:** Add print statements or use a debugger to step through the code and find where the unhashable type might be erroneously used as a key.\n\nIf the error persists and you're sure that the line presented in the error message is correct, consider checking other parts of your code where similar operations might be occurring, as the error message might refer to another part of your code base."
