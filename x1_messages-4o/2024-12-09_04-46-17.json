The pdb documentation mentions \"j(ump) lineno\" as a command to set the next line that will be executed. Is this command applicable to my situation?"

        "content": "In Python's `pdb` debugger, you cannot directly step backwards to a previous state or reevaluate a line that has already been executed. Once a line of code is executed, its effects (such as changes to variable states) are already applied, and `pdb` does not support reversing these changes.\n\nHowever, you can use the `j(ump) lineno` command to jump to a different line within the same frame (function), but this does not reverse the execution of any code. It simply changes the next line to be executed. This can be useful if you want to skip over lines or re-execute some lines, but be cautious as it can lead to inconsistent program states if code with side effects is re-executed.\n\nIf you realize that you needed to step into a function call after you've already stepped over it, you would typically need to restart your debugging session and set a breakpoint at the desired location to step into it.\n\nFor more advanced debugging steps, like stepping backwards, you might want to consider using more advanced tools or techniques, such as setting up your code with logging or using reversible debuggers like `rr` (for C/C++ programs). However, such tools are not native to Python debugging with `pdb`."
