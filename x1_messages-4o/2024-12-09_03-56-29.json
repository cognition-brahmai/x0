I have written the following function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np  \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt  \ndef graph(formula, x_range):  \n    x = np.array(x_range)  \n    y = formula  \n    plt.plot(x, y)  \n    plt.show()  \n```\n\nHowever, when I try to call this function using the command `graph(x**3+2*x-4, range(-10, 11))`, I receive the following error:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):  \n  File \"<pyshell#23>\", line 1, in <module>  \n    graph(x**3+2*x-4, range(-10, 11))  \nNameError: name 'x' is not defined  \n```\n\nIt seems to me that the function is trying to perform the multiplication operation before it gets to the line `y = formula`. How can I resolve this issue and successfully graph my formula using this function?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is due to the way the formula is being passed to the function. When you pass `x**3 + 2*x - 4` directly, Python tries to evaluate it before calling the function, but `x` is not defined in that context, leading to a `NameError`.\n\nTo fix this, you can pass the formula as a lambda function or a regular function, allowing it to be evaluated within the scope of the `graph` function. Here's how you can modify your `graph` function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef graph(formula, x_range):\n    x = np.array(x_range)\n    y = formula(x)\n    plt.plot(x, y)\n    plt.xlabel('x')\n    plt.ylabel('f(x)')\n    plt.title('Graph of the function')\n    plt.grid(True)\n    plt.show()\n\n# Example usage:\ngraph(lambda x: x**3 + 2*x - 4, range(-10, 11))\n```\n\nIn this revised version, `formula` is expected to be a function, and you can use a lambda function to define it inline when calling `graph`. The lambda function takes `x` as a parameter and returns the computed value. This way, `x` is properly defined in the context where the formula is evaluated."
