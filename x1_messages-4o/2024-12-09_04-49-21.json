Up until step 4 everything goes fine but I receive an error when the process tries to run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. The error reads as follows: \n\n```\nStep 4/7 : RUN pip install -r requirements.txt\n ---> Running in 7f4635a7510a\nCollecting Flask (from -r requirements.txt (line 1))\nRetrying (Retry(total=4, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None)) after \nconnection broken by 'NewConnectionError('<pip._vendor.requests.packages.urllib3.connection.VerifiedHTTPSConnection \nobject at 0x7fe3984d9b10>: Failed to establish a new connection: \n[Errno -3] Temporary failure in name resolution',)': /simple/flask/\n```\nI am unsure of what this error means and how to resolve it.

        "content": "The error message you're encountering suggests that there's a network connectivity issue within your Docker container, preventing `pip` from connecting to the Python Package Index (PyPI) to download the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`. Specifically, it is a DNS resolution issue, indicated by the \"Temporary failure in name resolution\" message.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Network Connection**: Ensure that your host machine has internet connectivity, as the Docker container relies on it to access external resources.\n\n2. **Restart Docker**: Sometimes simply restarting Docker can resolve transient network issues:\n   - On Windows or macOS, you can restart Docker from the Docker Desktop app.\n   - On Linux, you can use the command `sudo systemctl restart docker`.\n\n3. **Specify DNS Server**: You can specify a DNS server for Docker to use. Try adding Google's public DNS server (8.8.8.8) by modifying your Docker daemon configuration.\n   - Create or edit the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file and add:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"dns\": [\"8.8.8.8\", \"8.8.4.4\"]\n     }\n     ```\n   - Then restart Docker: `sudo systemctl restart docker`.\n\n4. **Add Network Mode**: Run your Docker build with `--network host` to use the host's network stack. This is more commonly used on Linux:\n   ```bash\n   docker build --network=host -t friendlyhello .\n   ```\n\n5. **Check Dockerfile**: Ensure that your `Dockerfile` is correctly set up and that there are no typos in the `requirements.txt` path or filename.\n\n6. **Temporary Docker Container**: Run a temporary container to check connectivity:\n   ```bash\n   docker run --rm -it python:3.8-slim bash\n   ```\n   Then, inside the container, try running:\n   ```bash\n   apt-get update\n   ping pypi.org\n   ```\n   If there are connectivity issues here, it confirms a network problem.\n\n7. **Proxy Configuration**: If you're behind a proxy, ensure Docker is configured to use it. This involves setting environment variables or configuring Docker's systemd service file.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the network issue causing the `pip install` command to fail. If the problem persists, consider reaching out to your network administrator for further assistance."
