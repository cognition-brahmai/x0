If the generator throws an exception, I would like to process that in the consumer function and then continue consuming the iterator until it's exhausted. I don't want to have any exception handling code in the generator. I tried implementing this with a while loop and exception handling, but it seems quite clumsy. How can I handle an exception thrown in a generator more elegantly?\n\nHere's the code I have currently:\n\n```python\ndef read():\n    while something():\n        yield something_else()\n\ndef process():\n    for item in read():\n        do_stuff\n\nreader = read()\nwhile True:\n    try:\n        item = next(reader)\n    except StopIteration:\n        break\n    except Exception as e:\n        log_error\n        continue\n    do_stuff(item)\n```"

        "content": "To handle exceptions thrown by a generator in a more elegant manner, you can encapsulate the exception handling logic within the consumer function itself. By doing this, you can eliminate the need for a while loop and handle exceptions within a for loop. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n```python\ndef read():\n    while something():\n        # This is where the generator might raise an exception\n        yield something_else()\n\ndef process():\n    reader = read()\n    for item in reader:\n        try:\n            # Process the item\n            do_stuff(item)\n        except Exception as e:\n            # Handle the exception and continue\n            log_error(e)\n            continue\n\n# Example usage\nprocess()\n```\n\nIn this implementation:\n- The `process()` function consumes items from the `read()` generator.\n- The `for` loop is used to iterate over items yielded by the generator, which simplifies the logic.\n- The `try-except` block is placed inside the loop to catch and handle exceptions for each item individually. This allows the script to log the error and continue processing subsequent items without exiting the loop.\n\nThis structure is cleaner and separates concerns, making it easier to read and maintain. It ensures that each item can be processed and any exceptions are handled gracefully, allowing the loop to continue iterating through the generator."
