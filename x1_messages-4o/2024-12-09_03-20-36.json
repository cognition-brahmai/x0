When I followed an answer from stack overflow and added the code to strip off the last linear layer, the printed model is nearly 5x larger than before. The FC layer is still there and if I try to invoke my_model.forward(), PyTorch complains about a size mismatch. It expects size [1, 3, 224, 224], but the input was [1, 1000]. Why is this happening and how can I correctly remove the last FC layer from the model?"

        "content": "When you are working with a ResNet152 model in PyTorch and you want to remove the last fully connected (FC) layer, the goal is typically to get the output of the layer before the FC layer, which is often used for feature extraction tasks. If your model size unexpectedly increases or if you encounter input size mismatches, it suggests there might be an issue with how the model is being modified or how the inputs are being handled.\n\nHere is a step-by-step guide to correctly remove the last FC layer from the ResNet152 model:\n\n1. **Load the Pre-trained Model:**\n   Start by loading the pre-trained ResNet152 model.\n\n   ```python\n   import torch\n   import torchvision.models as models\n\n   model = models.resnet152(pretrained=True)\n   ```\n\n2. **Modify the Model:**\n   ResNet models in PyTorch have an attribute called `fc` which is the final fully connected layer. You can replace this layer with an `Identity` layer to effectively remove it.\n\n   ```python\n   # Replace the last fully connected layer with an identity layer\n   model.fc = torch.nn.Identity()\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify the Model Architecture:**\n   Print the model to verify that the last layer has been replaced.\n\n   ```python\n   print(model)\n   ```\n\n   The output should show `Identity()` in place of the original FC layer.\n\n4. **Input Size Handling:**\n   Make sure you are providing inputs of the correct size to the modified model. The ResNet model expects inputs of size `[batch_size, 3, 224, 224]`. Ensure your input data is preprocessed and resized to this shape.\n\n   ```python\n   # Example input\n   dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)\n\n   # Forward pass\n   output = model(dummy_input)\n   print(output.shape)\n   ```\n\n5. **Understand the Output:**\n   With the FC layer removed or replaced by an `Identity` layer, the output will be a feature map rather than class scores. The shape will typically be `[batch_size, 2048]` since the last convolutional layer of ResNet152 outputs 2048 features.\n\n6. **Troubleshooting Size Mismatch:**\n   If you encounter a size mismatch error, double-check the input tensor's shape. It should match `[1, 3, 224, 224]` when batch size is 1. If your input is a different size, adjust it accordingly.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to correctly modify the ResNet152 model to exclude the last FC layer and obtain feature maps for further processing or analysis."
