I want this system to run a series of test cases every time a check-in is made and to send reminder emails to the relevant individuals when these tests fail. This is similar to what CruiseControl or TeamCity do. I know I could potentially use hooks in most Version Control Systems (VCSes), but this would necessitate the tests running on the same machine as the version control server, which isn't as clean a solution as I'd like. Can anyone recommend a small, user-friendly, open-source continuous integration system that would be suitable for a Python codebase?"

        "content": "For setting up a continuous integration (CI) system for your Python project, there are several open-source options that are user-friendly and suitable for your needs. Here are a few recommendations:\n\n1. **GitHub Actions**: If your project is hosted on GitHub, GitHub Actions is a built-in CI/CD tool that allows you to automate workflows directly in your repository. It is highly customizable, supports Python natively, and can be configured to run tests on different environments. You can also set up email notifications for failed builds.\n\n2. **GitLab CI/CD**: If you are using GitLab for your repository, it offers an integrated CI/CD solution. It\u2019s quite powerful and supports Docker, allowing you to define your build, test, and deployment pipelines in a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.\n\n3. **Travis CI**: Travis CI is a popular continuous integration service that integrates well with GitHub repositories. It is easy to set up and use, and supports Python projects out of the box. Although Travis CI is transitioning to a paid model, it still offers free tiers for open-source projects.\n\n4. **Jenkins**: Jenkins is a widely-used open-source automation server that provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying, and automating any project. It requires a bit more setup and maintenance but is very flexible and powerful.\n\n5. **CircleCI**: CircleCI offers a robust CI/CD platform that integrates well with GitHub and Bitbucket. It supports Python projects and allows you to run tests in parallel, reducing the time it takes to get feedback on changes.\n\n6. **Drone CI**: Drone is a lightweight CI/CD system that uses a container-based pipeline. It's easy to set up and configure, especially if you're already familiar with Docker.\n\n7. **AppVeyor**: While traditionally used for Windows-based applications, AppVeyor supports multiple platforms and can be used for Python projects. It integrates with GitHub and Bitbucket, and you can set it up to send email notifications on build failures.\n\nWhen choosing a CI system, consider factors such as ease of setup, integration with your existing tools, support for Python, and notification capabilities. Additionally, consider whether you need the CI system to run on your own infrastructure or if you prefer a cloud-based solution."
