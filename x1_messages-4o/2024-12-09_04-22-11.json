How can I return the document contents in spite of the exception?"

        "content": "To handle HTTPError exceptions while still accessing the response body using Python's `urllib2`, you can catch the `HTTPError` exception and then read the response body from the exception object itself. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Import the necessary modules**: You'll need `urllib2` for making HTTP requests and handling exceptions.\n\n2. **Make the HTTP request**: Use `urllib2.urlopen()` to make the request. If the server returns an error (e.g., 400 Bad Request), an `HTTPError` exception will be raised.\n\n3. **Catch the HTTPError exception**: When the exception is raised, catch it using a try-except block.\n\n4. **Access the response body**: The `HTTPError` object includes a file-like object from which you can read the response body. This will allow you to access the detailed error message in the response.\n\nHere's a code snippet demonstrating how to implement this:\n\n```python\nimport urllib2\n\nurl = 'http://example.com/api/resource'  # Replace with your URL\n\ntry:\n    response = urllib2.urlopen(url)\n    content = response.read()\n    print(\"Successfully fetched content:\")\n    print(content)\n\nexcept urllib2.HTTPError as e:\n    # Handle the HTTPError\n    print(f\"HTTPError occurred: {e.code} - {e.reason}\")\n\n    # You can read the response body from the HTTPError object\n    error_content = e.read()\n    print(\"Error response content:\")\n    print(error_content)\n\nexcept urllib2.URLError as e:\n    # Handle other URL-related errors (e.g., network issues)\n    print(f\"URLError occurred: {e.reason}\")\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n    # Handle any other exceptions\n    print(f\"An unexpected error occurred: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **HTTPError object**: The `HTTPError` object behaves like a response object, which means you can use `.read()` to get the content of the response, even if it's an error response.\n- **Printing the content**: Both in the success case and the error case, the response content is printed. In the error case, it's extracted from the `HTTPError` object.\n- **Handling other exceptions**: It's a good practice to handle other exceptions, such as `URLError`, to cover network-related issues.\n\nThis approach allows you to access the detailed error information contained in the response body, even when a 400 Bad Request error occurs."
