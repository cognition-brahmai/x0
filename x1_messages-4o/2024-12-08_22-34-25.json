Arrange the following numbers in ascending order and make sure that the sum of the even numbers is equal to the sum of the odd numbers, while the number in the middle must be a prime number: 25, 32, 5, 19, 3. What is the number that sits in the middle?"

        "content": "Let's first arrange the given numbers in ascending order: 3, 5, 19, 25, 32.\n\nNow, let's identify the even and odd numbers from the list:\n- Even numbers: 32\n- Odd numbers: 3, 5, 19, 25\n\nTo satisfy the condition where the sum of the even numbers equals the sum of the odd numbers, we need to find an appropriate combination. Since 32 is the only even number, we'll have to adjust the set of odd numbers to match this sum.\n\nLet's consider the odd numbers:\n- Sum of all odd numbers: 3 + 5 + 19 + 25 = 52\n\nSince the sum of even numbers is 32, we need to select those odd numbers whose sum is also 32. Let's try different combinations:\n- 3 + 5 + 25 = 33 (too high)\n- 3 + 19 = 22 (too low)\n- 5 + 19 = 24 (too low)\n- 19 + 13 = 32 (perfect, but we don't have 13 in the list)\n- 3 + 5 + 19 + 5 = 32 (perfect)\n\nWith this combination, the sum of the selected odd numbers is equal to the sum of the even number 32.\n\nFinally, according to the puzzle's constraint, the number in the middle must be a prime number. Let's re-arrange our selected numbers, maintaining the order while ensuring the middle number is prime:\n\nArranging the numbers: 3, 5, 19, 25, 32\nThe middle number here is 19.\n\nThus, 19 is the prime number that sits in the middle."
