My issue is that I want it to raise a ValueError when the specified character is not found within the string. For example, if I run `contains('bababa', 'k')`, I want it to return `ValueError: could not find k in bababa`. How can I modify my existing function to achieve this? Here's my current function:\n\n```python\ndef contains(string,char):\n  list = []\n\n  for i in range(0,len(string)):\n      if string[i] == char:\n           list = list + [i]\n\n  return list[-1]\n```"

        "content": "To modify your function to raise a `ValueError` when the specified character is not found in the string, you can check the length of the list holding the indices of the character. If the list is empty, it means the character was not found, and you can raise the `ValueError`. Here's how you can modify your function:\n\n```python\ndef contains(string, char):\n    indices = []\n\n    for i in range(len(string)):\n        if string[i] == char:\n            indices.append(i)\n\n    if not indices:\n        raise ValueError(f\"could not find {char} in {string}\")\n\n    return indices[-1]\n\n# Example usage\ntry:\n    result = contains('bababa', 'k')\n    print(result)\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(e)\n```\n\nChanges made:\n- I changed the variable name from `list` to `indices` to avoid shadowing the built-in `list` type.\n- Instead of using list concatenation (`list = list + [i]`), I used the `append()` method for efficiency.\n- I added a check to see if `indices` is empty. If it is, a `ValueError` is raised with the appropriate message.\n- I included an example of how to use the function with a try-except block to handle the `ValueError`."
