How can I check to see if the handler already exists in the logger? Ideally, I'd like to implement this without having to use a Singleton. Here is the section of code I am referring to:\n\n```python\nlogger = logging.getLogger()\nhdlr = logging.FileHandler('logfile.log')\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s')\nhdlr.setFormatter(formatter)\nlogger.addHandler(hdlr) \nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n```"

        "content": "To avoid adding multiple handlers to your logger each time the code is executed, you can check if a handler of the same type already exists. You can iterate over the existing handlers of the logger and check their type. Here\u2019s how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger()\n\n# Check if the logger already has a FileHandler\nif not any(isinstance(handler, logging.FileHandler) for handler in logger.handlers):\n    hdlr = logging.FileHandler('logfile.log')\n    formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s')\n    hdlr.setFormatter(formatter)\n    logger.addHandler(hdlr)\n\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We use `logger.handlers` to get the list of all handlers currently attached to the logger.\n- We use a generator expression with `any()` to check if any of the existing handlers is an instance of `logging.FileHandler`.\n- If no `FileHandler` is found, we create a new one and add it to the logger.\n- This approach prevents the same handler from being added multiple times without using a Singleton pattern."
