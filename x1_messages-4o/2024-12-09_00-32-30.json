I have certain projects that require the 64-bit version of Python 2.7.3 and others that require the 32-bit version due to some extensions not functioning in 64-bit. Previously, I was able to install Python 2.7.2 versions side by side without any issues. How can I achieve this with Python 2.7.3?"

        "content": "To install both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Python 2.7.3 on a Windows Vista 64-bit system without one version overwriting the other, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Download Installers**:\n   - Download the 32-bit and 64-bit installers for Python 2.7.3 from the official Python website or a trusted archive.\n\n2. **Create Separate Directories**:\n   - Create separate directories for each version. For example:\n     - `C:\\Python27_32` for the 32-bit version.\n     - `C:\\Python27_64` for the 64-bit version.\n\n3. **Install Python 32-bit**:\n   - Run the installer for the 32-bit version.\n   - During installation, choose \"Customize Installation\" and set the installation directory to `C:\\Python27_32`.\n   - Ensure to uncheck the option to add Python to the PATH, as you will manage this manually.\n\n4. **Install Python 64-bit**:\n   - Run the installer for the 64-bit version.\n   - Similarly, choose \"Customize Installation\" and set the installation directory to `C:\\Python27_64`.\n   - Again, uncheck the option to add Python to the PATH.\n\n5. **Manage Environment Variables**:\n   - You can manage which version of Python is active by adjusting the PATH environment variable.\n   - For convenience, you can create batch files to switch between versions.\n\n6. **Create Batch Files for Switching**:\n   - Create two batch files: one for the 32-bit version and one for the 64-bit version.\n   \n   **32-bit Batch File (e.g., `python32.bat`)**:\n   ```batch\n   @echo off\n   set PATH=C:\\Python27_32;%PATH%\n   python %*\n   ```\n\n   **64-bit Batch File (e.g., `python64.bat`)**:\n   ```batch\n   @echo off\n   set PATH=C:\\Python27_64;%PATH%\n   python %*\n   ```\n\n   - Place these batch files in a directory that is already in your PATH, or add their location to the PATH.\n\n7. **Using the Correct Version**:\n   - When you need to run a script using the 32-bit version, use the `python32` command.\n   - For the 64-bit version, use the `python64` command.\n\n8. **Testing**:\n   - Test both installations by running `python32 --version` and `python64 --version` in the command prompt to ensure they point to the correct versions.\n\nThis setup allows you to maintain both versions separately and switch between them as needed for different projects."
