Here's my current approach:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(i)\n    if(condition==true):\n        i=i-1\n```\nHowever, it seems that even though I'm decrementing `i`, the loop doesn't recognise it. Is there any method to repeat an iteration in a for loop in Python?"

        "content": "In Python, the `for` loop iterates over the elements of a sequence or range, and the loop variable (`i` in your case) is automatically reassigned at the beginning of each iteration. This means that changing the value of `i` within the loop body won't affect the next iteration, as `i` will be set to the next value in the sequence.\n\nTo achieve the effect of moving back an iteration, you can use a `while` loop instead. Here's how you can implement the desired functionality:\n\n```python\ni = 0\nwhile i < 5:\n    print(i)\n    # Replace `condition` with your actual condition\n    if condition == True:\n        i -= 1  # Go back one step\n    i += 1\n```\n\nIn this example, you manually control the loop variable `i`. You increment `i` at the end of each iteration, but if the condition is met, you decrement it instead, effectively repeating the iteration. This approach gives you the flexibility to control the flow of the loop as needed."
