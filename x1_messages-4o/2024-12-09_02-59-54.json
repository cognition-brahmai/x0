I am trying to understand the documentation for PyTorch's LSTM module (along with RNN and GRU which are similar). The documentations specifies the outputs as: output, (h_n, c_n) where output is a tensor containing the output features (h_t) from the last layer of the RNN for each t, and h_n is a tensor containing the hidden state for t=seq_len. It seems that both the variables 'output' and 'h_n' give the values of the hidden state. I am unsure if 'h_n' is simply providing the last time step that's already included in 'output' or if there's more to it."

        "content": "In PyTorch's LSTM module, the distinction between \"output\" and \"hidden\" (often referred to as `(h_n, c_n)`) can be a bit confusing at first, since they both relate to the hidden states of the LSTM. However, they serve different purposes and contain different information.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Output**: \n   - The `output` tensor contains the hidden states from the last layer of the LSTM for each time step in the input sequence. If your input sequence has a length of `seq_len`, and you have a batch size of `batch_size`, and your LSTM has `num_directions` (1 for unidirectional, 2 for bidirectional), and `hidden_size` hidden units, then the shape of `output` is `(seq_len, batch_size, num_directions * hidden_size)`.\n   - Essentially, `output` gives you the hidden state for every time step, for the last layer of the LSTM. This is useful if you need the hidden states for all time steps in your sequence, not just the final one.\n\n2. **Hidden State `(h_n, c_n)`**:\n   - `(h_n, c_n)` is a tuple where `h_n` gives you the hidden state, and `c_n` gives you the cell state of the LSTM, specifically for the last time step (`t=seq_len`).\n   - `h_n` has a shape of `(num_layers * num_directions, batch_size, hidden_size)`. This represents the hidden state for the last element in the sequence, for each layer and direction of the LSTM.\n   - `c_n`, the cell state, has the same shape as `h_n` and represents the internal memory of the LSTM cell for the last time step.\n\nThe key difference is the scope of time steps they cover:\n- `output` covers all time steps and provides the hidden state from the last layer for each step.\n- `h_n` (and `c_n`) specifically gives you the hidden (and cell) state for the last time step across all layers and directions.\n\nIn summary, use `output` if you need the LSTM's hidden states at every time step for some downstream task (like sequence-to-sequence models), and use `h_n` if you only need the hidden state at the last time step (like when you care about the final summary of the sequence)."
