Then, we'll filter those combinations to find which ones sum up to 30. Finally, we'll use the SymPy library to display the equation for each valid combination. Here's the Python code to do that:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\nfrom sympy import Eq, symbols\n\n# Given set of numbers\nnumbers = {3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27}\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of three numbers\ncombinations_of_three = combinations(numbers, 3)\n\n# Define the symbols for the equation\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\n\n# Iterate through the combinations and check which ones sum to 30\nvalid_combinations = []\nfor combo in combinations_of_three:\n    if sum(combo) == 30:\n        valid_combinations.append(combo)\n\n# Display the equations for each valid combination\nfor combo in valid_combinations:\n    equation = Eq(x + y + z, 30)\n    print(f\"Combination: {combo} -> Equation: {equation.subs({x: combo[0], y: combo[1], z: combo[2]})}\")\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will print out the combinations of numbers from the given set that add up to 30, along with their corresponding equations using the SymPy library."
