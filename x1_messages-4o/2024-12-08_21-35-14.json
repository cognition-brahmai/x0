I have a Ruby code that randomly combines adjectives and nouns to generate titles, but I'm not sure how to incorporate these specific adjectives.\nHere's the Ruby code:\nadjectives = [\"bright\", \"mysterious\", \"haunting\", \"enchanting\", \"captivating\"]\nnouns = [\"shadows\", \"mirrors\", \"secrets\", \"dreams\", \"memories\"]\ntitle = \"#{adjectives.sample.capitalize} #{nouns.sample.capitalize}\"\nputs title\nHow can I modify this code to ensure that the title includes both \"bright\" and \"mysterious\" in some way?"
