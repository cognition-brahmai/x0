My script utilizes Pandas and I've encountered an error when executing the file. The error message reads: \"No module named 'pandas._libs.tslibs.timedeltas'\". This error has not occurred when I tried wrapping Python scripts that do not use Pandas. I'm currently using Python 3.6, PyInstaller version 3.3, and Pandas version 0.20.3.

        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to missing compiled C extensions for Pandas when using PyInstaller. This can happen due to the way PyInstaller handles module imports and the specific version of Pandas you are using. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Upgrade Pandas**: Consider upgrading to a more recent version of Pandas. Pandas 0.20.3 is quite old, and newer versions have resolved many issues related to packaging with PyInstaller. You can upgrade Pandas using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade pandas\n   ```\n\n2. **Upgrade PyInstaller**: Ensure you're using the latest stable version of PyInstaller. The development version you are using might have some unresolved issues. You can upgrade PyInstaller with:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade pyinstaller\n   ```\n\n3. **Add Hidden Imports**: Sometimes, PyInstaller needs to be explicitly told about hidden imports. You can specify them using the `--hidden-import` flag. In your case, you might need to add the following:\n\n   ```bash\n   pyinstaller --hidden-import=pandas._libs.tslibs.timedeltas your_script.py\n   ```\n\n4. **Check your Spec File**: If you're using a spec file, ensure that the `hiddenimports` list includes the necessary modules:\n\n   ```python\n   hiddenimports=['pandas._libs.tslibs.timedeltas']\n   ```\n\n5. **Use a Clean Environment**: Sometimes, conflicts arise from the environment. Consider creating a new virtual environment and installing only the necessary packages:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\\Scripts\\activate`\n   pip install pandas pyinstaller\n   ```\n\n6. **Rebuild Pandas Extensions**: If the problem persists, try rebuilding the Pandas extensions in your environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall pandas\n   pip install --no-binary :all: pandas\n   ```\n\n7. **Debugging**: Use the `--debug` flag in PyInstaller to get more information about what might be going wrong:\n\n   ```bash\n   pyinstaller --debug=all your_script.py\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"No module named 'pandas._libs.tslibs.timedeltas'\" error. If the issue persists, consider checking the PyInstaller GitHub issues page for any similar reports or reaching out to the Pandas or PyInstaller communities for further assistance."
