        "content": "In Python, there is no built-in mechanism to enforce that a parent method is called from a child class when it is overridden. However, there are a few strategies you can adopt to encourage or enforce this behavior:\n\n1. **Documentation and Code Reviews**: Clearly document the requirement to call the parent class's `start` method, and enforce this practice through code reviews. This is not a technical solution, but it's effective in a collaborative environment.\n\n2. **Raising an Exception**: Modify the parent method to raise an exception if it detects that it hasn't been called. This approach requires cooperation from the child class, as it involves setting a flag or changing a variable:\n\n   ```python\n   class Parent(object):\n       def __init__(self):\n           self.someValue = 1\n           self._parent_called = False\n\n       def start(self):\n           self._parent_called = True\n           self.someValue += 1\n\n       def verify_call(self):\n           if not self._parent_called:\n               raise RuntimeError(\"Parent start() method must be called.\")\n\n   class Child(Parent):\n       def start(self):\n           Parent.start(self)\n           self.someValue += 1\n           self.verify_call()\n   ```\n\n3. **Using Decorators**: You can use a decorator to ensure the parent method is called. This approach can help enforce calling the parent method without relying on explicit calls in the child class's `start` method:\n\n   ```python\n   def ensure_parent_called(func):\n       def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):\n           Parent.start(self)  # Call the parent method\n           return func(self, *args, **kwargs)\n       return wrapper\n\n   class Parent(object):\n       def __init__(self):\n           self.someValue = 1\n\n       def start(self):\n           self.someValue += 1\n\n   class Child(Parent):\n       @ensure_parent_called\n       def start(self):\n           self.someValue += 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Template Method Pattern**: Use a template method pattern where the parent class provides a method that calls the overridable method in the child class. This ensures the parent logic is always executed:\n\n   ```python\n   class Parent(object):\n       def __init__(self):\n           self.someValue = 1\n\n       def start(self):\n           self.someValue += 1\n           self.do_start()\n\n       def do_start(self):\n           pass  # To be overridden in child classes\n\n   class Child(Parent):\n       def do_start(self):\n           self.someValue += 1\n   ```\n\nIn conclusion, while Python does not natively enforce calling the parent method, these strategies can help ensure that the parent class's functionality is preserved while developing subclasses. The choice of strategy depends on your specific use case and project requirements."
