        "content": "To concatenate a fixed string with a variable in Python, especially when dealing with command-line arguments, you need to ensure that you access the `sys.argv` list correctly and concatenate the strings properly. It looks like you're missing the necessary import statement and proper string concatenation in your code.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Make sure to import the `sys` module at the beginning of your script.\n2. Use the correct syntax for concatenating strings.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Ensure there is an argument passed\nif len(sys.argv) > 1:\n    file_name = sys.argv[1]\n    subject = \"Auto Hella Restart Report \" + file_name\n    msg = {'Subject': subject}\n\n    # Print the subject to verify\n    print(msg['Subject'])\nelse:\n    print(\"No file name provided. Please run the script with a file name argument.\")\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We import the `sys` module to access command-line arguments.\n- We check if there is at least one argument passed (excluding the script name itself).\n- We concatenate the fixed string with the file name passed as an argument using the `+` operator.\n- We print the subject to verify the result.\n\nMake sure to run your script from the command line with the argument like `python sample.py main.txt`. If the argument isn't provided, the script will prompt the user to provide one."
