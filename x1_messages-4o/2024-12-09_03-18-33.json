I currently specify the package version in setup.py as follows:\n\n```python\n# file: setup.py\n...\nsetup(\nname='foobar',\nversion='1.0.0',\n# other attributes\n)\n```\n\nI want to be able to access the same version number from within the package as well:\n\n```python\n>>> import foobar\n>>> foobar.__version__\n'1.0.0'\n```\n\nI've tried adding `__version__ = '1.0.0'` to my package's __init__.py file and including additional imports to create a simplified interface to the package:\n\n```python\n# file: __init__.py\n\nfrom foobar import foo\nfrom foobar.bar import Bar\n\n__version__ = '1.0.0'\n```\n\nAnd in setup.py:\n\n```python\n# file: setup.py\n\nfrom foobar import __version__\n...\nsetup(\nname='foobar',\nversion=__version__,\n# other attributes\n)\n```\n\nHowever, these additional imports can cause the installation of `foobar` to fail if they import other packages that are not yet installed. How can I correctly share the package version with setup.py and the package?"

        "content": "To share the package version between `setup.py` and the package itself without causing import issues, you can use a dedicated version file. This approach avoids importing the package during the setup process, which can indeed lead to problems if dependencies are not yet installed. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n1. **Create a Separate Version File:**\n\n   Create a file, say `version.py`, in your package directory (e.g., in the `foobar` directory):\n\n   ```python\n   # file: foobar/version.py\n   __version__ = '1.0.0'\n   ```\n\n2. **Modify `__init__.py` to Import the Version:**\n\n   In your package's `__init__.py`, import the version from `version.py`:\n\n   ```python\n   # file: foobar/__init__.py\n\n   from .version import __version__\n   from .foo import foo\n   from .bar import Bar\n   ```\n\n3. **Access the Version in `setup.py`:**\n\n   In `setup.py`, read the version from the `version.py` file directly. This avoids importing the package:\n\n   ```python\n   # file: setup.py\n\n   import os\n\n   def read_version():\n       version_file = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'foobar', 'version.py')\n       with open(version_file) as f:\n           exec(f.read())\n       return locals()['__version__']\n\n   setup(\n       name='foobar',\n       version=read_version(),\n       # other attributes\n   )\n   ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **Separate Version File:** By storing the version in a separate file, you can easily access it both from within the package and from `setup.py` without importing the package.\n  \n- **Reading the Version in `setup.py`:** The `exec()` function reads the `version.py` file and executes it in a local scope, allowing you to extract the `__version__` variable.\n\nThis method keeps your package's version information centralized and avoids the potential pitfalls of importing the package before installation is complete."
