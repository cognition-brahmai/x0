The current method I am using seems like a hack where I am adding commas between each JSON string and a beginning and ending square bracket to make it a proper list. Is there a better way to specify the JSON delimiter as a newline (\\n) instead of a comma (,)? Also, Python seems to be struggling to allocate memory for an object created from 2GB of data. Is there a way to construct each JSON object as I read the file line by line?\n\nThe current method I'm using is as follows:\n```\ncontent = open(file_path, \"r\").read() \nj_content = json.loads(\"[\" + content.replace(\"}\\n{\", \"},\\n{\") + \"]\")\n```\n\nThis is an example of what the JSON strings in the file look like:\n\n```\n{\n    \"key11\": value11,\n    \"key12\": value12,\n}\n{\n    \"key21\": value21,\n    \"key22\": value22,\n}\n\u2026\n```"

        "content": "To handle large JSON files where each JSON object is delimited by a newline, you can read and process each line individually, instead of loading the entire file into memory at once. This approach is more memory-efficient and avoids the need to manipulate the file content as a single string. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Read and Process Line by Line**: You can read the file line by line, parsing each JSON object individually using `json.loads()`.\n\n2. **Use Generators**: Generators can help you process one object at a time without holding the entire list of objects in memory.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef read_large_json(file_path):\n    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n        for line in file:\n            line = line.strip()\n            if line:  # Ensure the line is not empty\n                try:\n                    # Parse each JSON object\n                    json_object = json.loads(line)\n                    yield json_object\n                except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n                    print(f\"Error decoding JSON: {e}\")\n\n# Usage\nfile_path = 'path_to_your_large_json_file.json'\n\nfor json_obj in read_large_json(file_path):\n    # Process each json_obj as needed\n    print(json_obj)  # Replace with your processing logic\n```\n\n### Benefits of This Approach:\n- **Memory Efficiency**: Since you're processing one line at a time, you don't need to load the entire file into memory.\n- **Error Handling**: You can catch and handle JSON decoding errors for each line individually.\n- **Scalability**: This method scales well with larger files.\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- If your JSON objects might contain newline characters within strings, ensure that the file truly uses newline as the delimiter between objects.\n- Consider using a library like `ujson` or `orjson` for potentially faster JSON parsing if performance becomes a concern.\n\nBy reading the file line by line, you efficiently handle large files without running into memory issues."
