I haven't been able to find any information about this, but I thought it might be possible since both `dict` and `set` data structures work in similar ways under the hood. I understand that the Python documentation states that the order-preserving aspect of `dict`s is an implementation detail and should not be relied upon. But are `set`s ordered like `dict`s in Python 3.6?"

In Python 3.6, `set`s do not preserve order. The `set` data structure in Python is implemented using a hash table, similar to `dict`, but it is not ordered by default.\n\nStarting with Python 3.7, the insertion order preservation for `dict` became a part of the official language specification, meaning that from Python 3.7 onwards, you can rely on `dict` maintaining the order of elements as they were added. However, `set` still does not preserve order, even in Python 3.7 and later versions. If you need an ordered version of a set, you might consider using the `collections.OrderedDict` with keys or a `list` to maintain order while ensuring uniqueness manually.\n\nThus, as of Python 3.6 and beyond, while `dict` maintains order, `set` does not."
