The `shape` attribute returns the dimensions of the image in the form of a tuple `(height, width, channels)`. Here's how you can do it in Python:\n\n```python\nimport cv2\n\n# Load the image\nsrc = cv2.imread('path_to_your_image.jpg')\n\n# Get the dimensions of the image\nheight, width, channels = src.shape\n\n# Print the width\nprint(width)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1. `cv2.imread()` is used to read the image from the specified file path.\n2. `src.shape` provides the dimensions of the image. The first element is the height, the second is the width, and the third is the number of color channels (if the image is colored).\n\nMake sure to replace `'path_to_your_image.jpg'` with the actual path to your image file."
