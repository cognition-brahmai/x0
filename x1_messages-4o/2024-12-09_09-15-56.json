An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.\n\nHere's a Python function to check if two strings are anagrams:\n\n```python\ndef are_anagrams(string1, string2):\n    # Remove any spaces and convert strings to lowercase\n    string1 = string1.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n    string2 = string2.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n    \n    # Sort the strings and compare\n    return sorted(string1) == sorted(string2)\n\n# Example usage\nstring1 = \"listen\"\nstring2 = \"silent\"\n\nif are_anagrams(string1, string2):\n    print(f'\"{string1}\" and \"{string2}\" are anagrams.')\nelse:\n    print(f'\"{string1}\" and \"{string2}\" are not anagrams.')\n```\n\nThis function first removes any spaces and converts both strings to lowercase to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive and doesn't consider spaces. Then, it sorts the characters of both strings and compares them. If they are equal, the strings are anagrams."
