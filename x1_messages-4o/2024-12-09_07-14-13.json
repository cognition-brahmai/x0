The error arises in the line `return ''.join(map(quoter, s))` in urllib's quote function. The issue seems to stem from the fact that the function is searching for the key `\\xe8` instead of `%E8` for non-ascii character `\u00e8`. My temporary fix of modifying `s = [el.upper().replace(\"\\\\X\",\"%\") for el in s]` before calling `''.join(map(quoter, s))` within the try-except block seems to work, but I'm unsure if this is the correct approach or if it will cause other issues. Additionally, deployment of this fix on all 200+ Linux instances would be quite challenging."

        "content": "The issue you're encountering stems from the fact that `urllib.quote` from Python 2 does not handle non-ASCII characters well, as it is designed for ASCII-only input. In Python 3, this has been improved with `urllib.parse.quote`, which automatically handles non-ASCII characters by using UTF-8 encoding. However, if you're working in a Python 2 environment, you have to handle encoding explicitly.\n\nHere's a more reliable way to handle this in Python 2:\n\n1. **Encode the string to UTF-8** before passing it to `urllib.quote`.\n\n2. **Use `urllib.quote` with the `safe` parameter** to ensure certain characters remain unencoded if desired.\n\nHere is a snippet that demonstrates this approach:\n\n```python\nimport urllib\n\n# Original string with non-ASCII characters\noriginal_string = \"sch\u00f6nefeld\"\n\n# Encode the string to UTF-8\nutf8_string = original_string.encode('utf-8')\n\n# Use urllib.quote with UTF-8 encoded string\nencoded_string = urllib.quote(utf8_string)\n\nprint(encoded_string)\n```\n\nThis will properly encode non-ASCII characters without modifying the `urllib` module itself. This method avoids modifying core library code and should work consistently across all instances without needing to deploy changes in the Python standard library.\n\nIf you are able to upgrade to Python 3, you can leverage `urllib.parse.quote` directly without manually encoding, as shown below:\n\nPython 3 example:\n\n```python\nimport urllib.parse\n\noriginal_string = \"sch\u00f6nefeld\"\n\n# Use urllib.parse.quote which handles encoding\nencoded_string = urllib.parse.quote(original_string)\n\nprint(encoded_string)\n```\n\nConsider transitioning to Python 3 if possible, as it offers better native support for such operations and overall improved features. If upgrading isn't an option, the UTF-8 encoding approach in Python 2 should suffice."
