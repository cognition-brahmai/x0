I'm receiving a query string parameter from a form and I need to use this as a datetime filter in Django. The issue is that when I convert the string to a datetime, it doesn't create a timezone-aware datetime, leading to a loss of several hours due to timezone differences. Here's the code I'm currently using:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import date\n# Example from what I receive as GET querystring parameter\nstart_date, end_date = '15-01-2016', '16-01-2016'\nDATE_FORMAT = '%Y-%m-%d'\nstart_date = start_date.split('-')\nstart_date = date(int(start_date[2]), int(start_date[1]), int(start_date[0]))\nsd_filter = start_date.strftime(DATE_FORMAT)\n\nend_date = end_date.split('-')\nend_date = date(int(end_date[2]), int(end_date[1]), int(end_date[0]))\ned_filter = end_date.strftime(DATE_FORMAT)\n\n#query\nmy_list = MyModel.objects.filter(created_at__range=(sd_filter, ed_filter))\n```\n\nThe problem seems to be with the filter as I'm losing a few hours due to the timezone set in Django settings. I have pytz installed and `USE_TZ = True` is set in my settings as well. Note that I don't need to convert a `datetime.now()` to my time, but rather need to convert a string to a timezone-aware datetime."

        "content": "To handle timezone-aware datetime objects in Django, especially when you're dealing with string inputs, you can use Python's `datetime` module in conjunction with `pytz` to ensure the datetimes are timezone-aware. In your case, you want to convert a string like '2016-01-01' into a timezone-aware datetime object before using it for filtering.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport pytz\nfrom django.conf import settings\n\n# Example from what you receive as GET querystring parameter\nstart_date_str, end_date_str = '15-01-2016', '16-01-2016'\nDATE_FORMAT = '%d-%m-%Y'  # Update the format to match the input\n\n# Convert string to naive datetime\nstart_date_naive = datetime.strptime(start_date_str, DATE_FORMAT)\nend_date_naive = datetime.strptime(end_date_str, DATE_FORMAT)\n\n# Make datetime objects timezone-aware\nlocal_tz = pytz.timezone(settings.TIME_ZONE)  # Get the local timezone from settings\nstart_date_aware = local_tz.localize(start_date_naive)\nend_date_aware = local_tz.localize(end_date_naive)\n\n# Query using timezone-aware datetime objects\nmy_list = MyModel.objects.filter(created_at__range=(start_date_aware, end_date_aware))\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Parsing Date Strings:** Use `datetime.strptime()` to parse the input date strings into naive datetime objects. Adjust the `DATE_FORMAT` to match the input format.\n\n2. **Localizing to Timezone:** Use `pytz` to make these datetime objects timezone-aware by calling `localize()` with the appropriate timezone from your Django settings (`settings.TIME_ZONE`).\n\n3. **Filtering with Timezone-Aware Datetimes:** Use the localized datetimes in your query to ensure that all operations respect the specified timezone.\n\nBy following these steps, you ensure that your datetime objects are correctly adjusted for the time zone, and your filtering will operate as expected without any hour discrepancies."
