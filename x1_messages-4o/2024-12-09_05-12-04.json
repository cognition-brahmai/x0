The webserver module tries to import 'auto_process_form_insert' from the 'foobar.formtools' module using the line `from foobar.formtools import auto_process_form_insert`. Similarly, the 'foobar.formtools' module attempts to import 'redirect' and 'redirect_back' from the webserver module with the line `from foobar.webserver import redirect, redirect_back`. Both attempts result in ImportErrors: `ImportError: cannot import name auto_process_form_insert` and `ImportError: cannot import name redirect` respectively. Is it a principle in Python that two modules cannot import each other's contents and all module imports must be hierarchical? Or am I doing something wrong here? Is there any workaround for this other than placing these functions in new modules?"

        "content": "What you're encountering is known as a circular import problem. In Python, circular imports occur when two or more modules attempt to import each other directly or indirectly, leading to an ImportError because Python gets stuck in a loop trying to resolve these imports.\n\nHere\u2019s a simplified explanation of what's happening:\n\n1. **Module A** tries to import something from **Module B**.\n2. **Module B**, in turn, tries to import something from **Module A**.\n3. Since both modules depend on each other to be fully loaded before they can proceed, Python encounters an issue because neither module can be fully loaded due to the dependency loop.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n1. **Refactor your code**: The most straightforward solution is to refactor your code to eliminate the circular dependency. You can do this by moving the dependent functions or classes into a third module that both original modules can import from. This is often the cleanest solution and helps maintain your code's modularity.\n\n   For example, create a new module named `shared_tools.py`:\n   ```python\n   # shared_tools.py\n   def auto_process_form_insert():\n       # implementation\n       pass\n\n   def redirect():\n       # implementation\n       pass\n\n   def redirect_back():\n       # implementation\n       pass\n   ```\n\n   Then, import the necessary functions from `shared_tools.py` in both of your original modules:\n   ```python\n   # foobar.formtools.py\n   from shared_tools import auto_process_form_insert\n\n   # foobar.webserver.py\n   from shared_tools import redirect, redirect_back\n   ```\n\n2. **Use local imports**: Another option, though less preferable, is to use local imports within functions or methods. This way, the imports are resolved only when the function is called, thereby avoiding the circular import issue at the module level. However, this can lead to less readable code and potential performance impacts if the imports are frequent.\n\n   ```python\n   # foobar.formtools.py\n   def some_function():\n       from foobar.webserver import redirect\n       # use redirect here\n\n   # foobar.webserver.py\n   def another_function():\n       from foobar.formtools import auto_process_form_insert\n       # use auto_process_form_insert here\n   ```\n\n3. **Reevaluate the design**: Sometimes, circular imports indicate a design issue. Consider whether the modules are too tightly coupled and if a redesign might improve the separation of concerns.\n\nIn general, refactoring to eliminate circular dependencies is the best long-term solution, as it makes your codebase more maintainable and easier to understand."
