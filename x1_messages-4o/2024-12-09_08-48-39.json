        "content": "To find the least common number in a list, you can use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number, and then identify the number with the smallest count. Here's a Python example to illustrate this:\n\n```python\ndef find_least_common_number(lst):\n    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each number\n    frequency_dict = {}\n    \n    # Count the occurrences of each number in the list\n    for num in lst:\n        if num in frequency_dict:\n            frequency_dict[num] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency_dict[num] = 1\n\n    # Find the number with the minimum frequency\n    least_common_number = None\n    min_count = float('inf')\n    \n    for num, count in frequency_dict.items():\n        if count < min_count:\n            min_count = count\n            least_common_number = num\n\n    return least_common_number\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 4, 5, 5]\nresult = find_least_common_number(numbers)\nprint(f\"The least common number is: {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Frequency Dictionary**: A dictionary is used to count how many times each number appears in the list.\n\n2. **Count Occurrences**: Iterate through each number in the list, updating the dictionary with the count of each number.\n\n3. **Find Minimum Frequency**: Iterate through the dictionary to find the number with the smallest count.\n\n4. **Return Result**: The function returns the number with the least occurrences.\n\nThis code will return the least common number in the list, and if there are multiple numbers with the same least frequency, it will return the first one encountered. Adjust the code as needed for your specific requirements or edge cases."
