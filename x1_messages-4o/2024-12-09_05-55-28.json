        "content": "In Python, when both a module and a package share the same name, the interpreter follows a specific order to determine which one to load when you execute `import foo`.\n\n1. **Module vs. Package**: Python searches for modules and packages in the directories listed in `sys.path`. If both a module (`foo.py`) and a package (`foo/`) exist with the same name in the same directory, the module (`foo.py`) will be prioritized and loaded first. This is because Python checks for a module file before looking for a directory representing a package.\n\n2. **Specifying Loading Order**:\n   - To import the module (`foo.py`), you can simply use `import foo`, as it will be loaded by default.\n   - To specifically import the package (`foo/`), you can manipulate the import system using a relative or absolute import within the package, or you can adjust `sys.path` to prioritize the directory containing the package before the one containing the module. Another approach is to restructure your project to avoid this naming conflict.\n\nTo avoid confusion, it's generally recommended to avoid having both a module and a package with the same name in the same directory. This can be managed by organizing your project structure differently or renaming either the module or the package."
