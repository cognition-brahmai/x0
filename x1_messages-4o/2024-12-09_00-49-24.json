Here is how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming 'x' is your DataFrame\nx = pd.DataFrame(...)\n\n# Extract the first column and convert it to a Series\ns = x.iloc[:, 0]\n\n# 's' is now a Series containing the first column of the DataFrame\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `x.iloc[:, 0]` is used to select all rows (`:`) of the first column (`0`) from the DataFrame `x`.\n- The result is directly a pandas Series, as `iloc` with a single column index returns a Series."
