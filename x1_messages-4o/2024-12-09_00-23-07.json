        "content": "To package your Python module along with a precompiled shared object (.so) library, you can include the .so file directly within your Python package and ensure it is installed in a way that allows Python to find it without needing to set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. You can do this by modifying your `setup.py` file to include the .so file as a package data file.\n\nHere's how you can modify your `setup.py` file:\n\n```python\nfrom setuptools import setup, find_packages\nfrom setuptools.command.build_ext import build_ext\nimport os\n\nclass CustomBuildExt(build_ext):\n    def run(self):\n        # Ensure the build directory exists\n        os.makedirs(self.build_lib, exist_ok=True)\n        # Copy the .so file to the build directory\n        self.copy_file('top_secret_wrapper/top_secret.so', os.path.join(self.build_lib, 'top_secret_wrapper/top_secret.so'))\n        super().run()\n\nsetup(\n    name='top_secret_wrapper',\n    version='0.1',\n    description='A Python wrapper for a top secret algorithm',\n    url=None,\n    author='James Bond',\n    author_email='James.Bond.007@mi6.org',\n    license='Spy Game License',\n    packages=find_packages(),\n    include_package_data=True,\n    cmdclass={'build_ext': CustomBuildExt},\n    zip_safe=False,\n    package_data={\n        'top_secret_wrapper': ['top_secret.so'],\n    },\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **find_packages()**: This function will automatically find your packages based on the directory structure, which is helpful when you have a nested package structure.\n\n2. **CustomBuildExt**: This custom build extension class ensures that the `.so` file is copied to the appropriate directory during the build process. This makes sure that when the package is installed, the `.so` file is placed where your Python module can find it.\n\n3. **include_package_data=True**: This tells setuptools to include package data files specified in `package_data`.\n\n4. **package_data**: This specifies which non-Python files should be included within the package. Here, it includes the `top_secret.so` file.\n\n5. **cmdclass**: This specifies custom commands for the build process. Here, it specifies the custom build extension class to handle the copying of the `.so` file.\n\n6. **zip_safe=False**: This is set to `False` because you want to include a shared object file, which may not work correctly if the package is installed as a zipped egg.\n\n### Usage:\nOnce your `setup.py` is updated, you can package and install your module using:\n\n```bash\npython setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\npip install .\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that your `.so` file is part of the package and is installed in the same directory as your Python modules, allowing Python to find and use it without setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`."
