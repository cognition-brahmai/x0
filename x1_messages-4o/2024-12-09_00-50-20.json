The project uses cmake for building, and I would like to add my extensions without using a library, by building object files from my CUDA sources. Then, I would like to link these object files with some other files compiled with other compilers. Could anyone guide me on how to accomplish this? I have already looked at http://code.google.com/p/cudpp/wiki/BuildingCUDPPwithCMake for guidance on using CUDA with cmake, but this solution also uses a library."

        "content": "To achieve your goal of building CUDA source files into object files and then linking them with other files using CMake, you'll need to follow a few steps. Here's a general guide on how you can set up your `CMakeLists.txt` to accomplish this without creating a separate library:\n\n1. **Find and Enable CUDA:**\n   Ensure that CMake can find and use CUDA. You can use `find_package` to locate CUDA in your system.\n\n   ```cmake\n   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)  # Adjust according to your CMake version\n   project(MyMPIandCUDAProject)\n\n   find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)\n   ```\n\n2. **Compile CUDA Source Files into Object Files:**\n   You can specify CUDA source files and compile them into object files. Use `cuda_add_executable` or `add_library` with `OBJECT` to achieve this.\n\n   ```cmake\n   set(CUDA_FILES\n       src/my_cuda_file.cu\n       src/another_cuda_file.cu\n   )\n\n   # Compile CUDA files to object files\n   cuda_compile(OBJ_FILES ${CUDA_FILES})\n   ```\n\n3. **Compile Other Source Files:**\n   Similarly, compile the non-CUDA source files. You can use `add_executable` or `add_library` as needed.\n\n   ```cmake\n   set(CPP_FILES\n       src/my_cpp_file.cpp\n       src/another_cpp_file.cpp\n   )\n\n   add_executable(MyExecutable ${CPP_FILES})\n   ```\n\n4. **Link Object Files:**\n   To link the CUDA object files with your executable, you can manually specify the object files in the `target_link_libraries`.\n\n   ```cmake\n   target_link_libraries(MyExecutable ${OBJ_FILES} ${CUDA_LIBRARIES})\n   ```\n\n5. **Include Directories and Link Libraries:**\n   Make sure you include necessary directories and link any required MPI or CUDA libraries.\n\n   ```cmake\n   include_directories(${CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRS})\n   target_link_libraries(MyExecutable ${CUDA_LIBRARIES} mpi)  # Link MPI if needed\n   ```\n\n6. **Set Additional Compiler Options:**\n   You might need to set additional compiler options for CUDA and MPI. For instance, if you require specific CUDA architectures:\n\n   ```cmake\n   set(CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS \"${CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS} -arch=sm_35\")  # Adjust architecture as needed\n   ```\n\n7. **Configure and Build:**\n   Once your `CMakeLists.txt` is configured, run CMake to configure the project and then build it.\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir build\n   cd build\n   cmake ..\n   make\n   ```\n\nRemember to adjust paths, flags, and configurations to suit your project's specific requirements. This setup allows you to compile CUDA source files into object files and link them with other compiled files, without creating a separate library."
