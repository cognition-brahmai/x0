        "content": "Certainly! Here is a simple Java implementation to calculate the factorial of a given number using both an iterative and a recursive approach:\n\n### Iterative Approach\n```java\npublic class FactorialIterative {\n    public static long factorial(int n) {\n        long result = 1;\n        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\n            result *= i;\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int number = 5; // Example number\n        System.out.println(\"Factorial of \" + number + \" is: \" + factorial(number));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Recursive Approach\n```java\npublic class FactorialRecursive {\n    public static long factorial(int n) {\n        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {\n            return 1;\n        } else {\n            return n * factorial(n - 1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int number = 5; // Example number\n        System.out.println(\"Factorial of \" + number + \" is: \" + factorial(number));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Iterative Approach**: This uses a for loop to multiply numbers from 2 up to the given number. It's straightforward and efficient for most cases.\n- **Recursive Approach**: This uses a function that calls itself with a decremented value until it reaches the base case. This is elegant but can lead to stack overflow for very large numbers due to deep recursion.\n\nYou can choose either approach based on your preference and the constraints of your problem."
