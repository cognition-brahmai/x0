        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the use of the `next()` method, which does not exist for file objects in Python 3. Instead, you should use the `readline()` method to read lines one by one from the file, or you can iterate directly over the file object in a loop. Here's how you can modify your code to fix the error:\n\n```python\n# Open the file in write mode\nfo = open(\"foo.txt\", \"w\")\nprint(\"Name of the file: \", fo.name)\n\n# Write some lines to the file\nseq = [\"This is 1st line\\n\", \"This is 2nd line\\n\", \"This is 3rd line\\n\",\n       \"This is 4th line\\n\", \"This is 5th line\\n\", \"This is 6th line\\n\", \"This is 7th line\\n\"]\nfo.writelines(seq)\n\n# Close and reopen the file in read mode\nfo.close()\nfo = open(\"foo.txt\", \"r\")\n\n# Read and print each line from the file\nindex = 0\nfor line in fo:\n    print(\"Line No %d - %s\" % (index + 1, line.strip()))\n    index += 1\n\n# Close the file\nfo.close()\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Writing Initial Lines**: I've added the initial lines directly to the `seq` list and written them to the file.\n2. **Reading the File**: Instead of using the `next()` method, I've used a `for` loop to iterate over each line in the file. This is the preferred way to read lines from a file in Python 3.\n3. **Printing Lines**: The `strip()` method is used to remove any trailing newline characters when printing each line.\n\nThis code should work without any errors and output the contents of the file line by line."
