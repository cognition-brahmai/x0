        "content": "I am working on reinforcement learning algorithms with continuous states (dimension = 20) and discrete actions (3 possible actions). For an optimal policy, one action (let's call it \"action 0\") should be selected much more frequently than the other two, almost 100 times more often, as these two actions are riskier. I previously tried Q-learning with Neural Network (NN) value-function approximation, but the results were not satisfactory since the NN always chose \"action 0\". I have considered policy gradient methods on NN weights, but I'm unsure of how to use them with discrete actions. Can anyone provide some advice on what to try, maybe suggest algorithms or papers to read? What are the best practices or state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms when the state space is continuous and action space is discrete?"

        "content": "When dealing with continuous state spaces and discrete action spaces, there are several reinforcement learning algorithms that can be effective. Here are some suggestions and considerations for your scenario:\n\n1. **Policy Gradient Methods**: These methods are well-suited for problems with discrete action spaces. They work by directly optimizing the policy, which can help in cases where value-based methods like Q-learning have difficulties due to function approximation.\n\n   - **REINFORCE (Monte Carlo Policy Gradient)**: This algorithm estimates the gradient of the expected return with respect to the policy parameters using samples and updates the policy in the direction of the gradient. However, it can have high variance, so variance reduction techniques, like baseline subtraction, can be beneficial.\n\n   - **Actor-Critic Methods**: These combine value-based and policy-based methods, providing a good balance. The \"actor\" updates the policy directly, while the \"critic\" estimates the value function to reduce variance in the policy gradient estimate. Popular variants include A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic) and PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization).\n\n2. **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: PPO is a state-of-the-art policy gradient method that uses a clipped objective function to provide stable and reliable policy updates. It\u2019s generally more sample-efficient and stable compared to vanilla policy gradients.\n\n3. **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)**: Although originally designed for continuous action spaces, SAC can be adapted for discrete actions. SAC uses entropy regularization to encourage exploration by maximizing both the expected return and entropy of the policy.\n\n4. **Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)**: TRPO is another policy gradient method that uses a constraint on the KL-divergence between the new and old policies to ensure stable updates. It can handle discrete actions effectively.\n\n5. **Deep Q-Network Variants**: While you've had some issues with Q-learning, it might be worthwhile to explore variations like Double DQN or Dueling DQN, which can help mitigate some of the issues with overestimation and instability in function approximation.\n\n6. **Categorical DQN**: This is an extension of the DQN algorithm that models the distribution of returns, allowing it to capture more information about the distribution of rewards. It can be more effective in certain environments.\n\nFor practical implementation, consider using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, which have built-in support for many of these algorithms through frameworks like OpenAI\u2019s Baselines or Stable Baselines3.\n\n**Papers and Resources**:\n\n- \"Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms\" by John Schulman et al.\n- \"Trust Region Policy Optimization\" by John Schulman et al.\n- \"Soft Actor-Critic: Off-Policy Maximum Entropy Deep Reinforcement Learning with a Stochastic Actor\" by Tuomas Haarnoja et al.\n\nThese papers will give you a deeper understanding of the mechanisms and benefits of these algorithms. Additionally, consider reviewing implementations and tutorials to better understand practical setups and hyperparameter tuning strategies for these methods."
