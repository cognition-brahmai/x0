        "content": "To rearrange the elements of a list by swapping adjacent elements in Python, you can iterate through the list and swap each pair of adjacent elements. Here's a simple implementation of this functionality:\n\n```python\ndef swap_adjacent_elements(L):\n    # Iterate over the list with a step of 2\n    for i in range(0, len(L) - 1, 2):\n        # Swap the elements at index i and i+1\n        L[i], L[i + 1] = L[i + 1], L[i]\n    return L\n\n# Example usage:\nL = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nswapped_list = swap_adjacent_elements(L)\nprint(swapped_list)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- The `for` loop iterates over the list `L` with a step of 2, which means it processes elements in pairs.\n- Inside the loop, the elements at positions `i` and `i+1` are swapped using Python's tuple unpacking.\n- This function will work for lists with both even and odd lengths. If the list has an odd length, the last element will remain in its original position since there's no adjacent element to swap with.\n\nYou can call `swap_adjacent_elements` with your list to see the result."
