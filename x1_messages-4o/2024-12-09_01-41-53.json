        "content": "In Flask, if you want to create a new, clean session and invalidate the current one, you typically don't need to use `make_null_session()` or `open_session()` directly. Instead, you can manage sessions using the built-in session handling provided by Flask. Here's a common approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Clear the current session**: You can clear the current session data using the `session.clear()` method. This will remove all the data stored in the session.\n\n2. **Invalidate the session**: To ensure that the current session is invalidated, you can also regenerate the session identifier. This can be done by using the `session.modified = True` attribute after clearing the session data. However, Flask does not have a built-in method to regenerate the session identifier like some other frameworks do. If you need this capability, you'll have to implement your own session ID regeneration logic, possibly involving a custom session interface.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you might clear the session in a Flask application:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, session, redirect, url_for\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.secret_key = 'your_secret_key'  # Ensure you have a secret key set for sessions\n\n@app.route('/logout')\ndef logout():\n    # Clear the session data\n    session.clear()\n    \n    # Optionally, mark the session as modified if needed\n    session.modified = True\n    \n    # Redirect to the login page or home page\n    return redirect(url_for('login'))\n\n@app.route('/login')\ndef login():\n    # Your login logic here\n    return \"Login Page\"\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\nIn this example, when a user hits the `/logout` route, the session is cleared, effectively invalidating the current session data. You can then redirect the user to a login page or any other page as needed.\n\nIf you need more advanced session management (like regenerating session identifiers), you may need to look into implementing a custom session interface or using third-party extensions that offer this functionality."
