This approach can improve the effectiveness of treatments and reduce adverse reactions by considering the unique genetic makeup and characteristics of each patient. For example, certain cancer treatments can be customized based on the genetic mutations present in a tumor.</p>\n    \n    <h2>Example 2: Forensic Science</h2>\n    <p>DNA sequencing has become a crucial tool in forensic science. By analyzing DNA samples from crime scenes, forensic scientists can identify suspects with high accuracy. This technology not only helps in solving crimes but also plays a vital role in exonerating wrongly accused individuals, ensuring justice is served more accurately.</p>\n    \n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis HTML page includes a simple structure with two sections, each highlighting a way DNA sequencing can be useful. Personalized medicine and forensic science are two significant fields benefiting from DNA sequencing technology."
