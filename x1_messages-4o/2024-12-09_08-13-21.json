        "content": "The error you're encountering indicates that the dynamic linker is unable to locate the shared library `libpython2.7.so.1.0`. This usually happens because the library path is not included in the system's library search path. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify the Library Path:**\n   First, ensure that `libpython2.7.so.1.0` is actually located in a directory such as `/usr/local/lib` or another directory specified in your `--prefix` option during installation.\n\n2. **Update the Library Cache:**\n   You need to update the system's library cache to include the directory where `libpython2.7.so.1.0` is located. You can do this by adding the directory to `/etc/ld.so.conf` or a new file in `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/` and then running `ldconfig`.\n\n   ```bash\n   echo \"/usr/local/lib\" | sudo tee -a /etc/ld.so.conf.d/python2.7.conf\n   sudo ldconfig\n   ```\n\n3. **Set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:**\n   As an alternative or temporary solution, you can set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to include the directory where the library is located. This method is less permanent and is usually used for testing.\n\n   ```bash\n   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n   ```\n\n   You can add the above line to your shell's startup file (like `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`) to make the change persistent across sessions.\n\n4. **Recompile with RPATH:**\n   If you want the binary to always know where to find its libraries, you can recompile Python with the `RPATH` set. However, this is typically not necessary if the above steps work.\n\nAfter performing these steps, try running `/usr/local/bin/python` again, and it should be able to locate `libpython2.7.so.1.0`. If you still encounter issues, double-check the library path and ensure there are no typos or permission issues."
