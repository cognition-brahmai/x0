        "content": "To manage multiple versions of Python on your Windows XP SP2 machine and specify which version to use for each project, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install Both Versions**: Ensure both Python 2.6 and Python 2.5 are installed on your system. They should be installed in different directories, e.g., `C:\\Python26` for Python 2.6 and `C:\\Python25` for Python 2.5.\n\n2. **Modify the PATH Environment Variable**:\n   - Open the Control Panel, go to System, and select the Advanced tab.\n   - Click on \"Environment Variables\".\n   - Under \"System Variables\", find the `PATH` variable and click \"Edit\".\n   - Add the path to the Python version you want to use at the beginning of the `PATH` string. For example, add `C:\\Python26` or `C:\\Python25` depending on the project.\n\n3. **Use Python Launcher for Windows**:\n   - Although more common in later versions, you can try using a Python launcher if available or set up a custom script to switch between versions.\n   - Create a batch file for each project that sets the `PATH` for the specific Python version. For example, create `project1.bat` with `set PATH=C:\\Python26;%PATH%` and `project2.bat` with `set PATH=C:\\Python25;%PATH%`.\n\n4. **Create Virtual Environments**:\n   - While virtual environments are more of a feature of Python 3.x, you can manually set up isolated project environments by adjusting scripts and `PATH` settings as needed.\n\n5. **Use Shebang Line in Scripts**:\n   - If you run your scripts from a command line or batch file, specify the Python version at the start. For instance, use `#!C:\\Python26\\python.exe` at the beginning of your script for Python 2.6.\n\n6. **Command Line Execution**:\n   - When executing scripts, you can specify the full path to the desired Python executable. For example:\n     - `C:\\Python26\\python.exe my_script.py` for Python 2.6\n     - `C:\\Python25\\python.exe my_script.py` for Python 2.5\n\nThese methods will help you manage and switch between different Python versions for your projects on a Windows XP SP2 machine."
