I was following a tutorial and created my virtual environment using the `--no-site-packages` flag. I'm currently using Ubuntu 13.10 in a Greek environment, could that be causing the issue? Here's the error I encounter:\n\n```\n(venv)avlahop@apostolos-laptop:~/development/django/rhombus-dental$ sudo pip install psycopg2\nDownloading/unpacking psycopg2,\nDownloading psycopg2-2.5.2.tar.gz (685kB): 685kB downloaded\nRunning setup.py egg_info for package psycopg2\n\nInstalling collected packages: psycopg2\n  Running setup.py install for psycopg2\n    building 'psycopg2._psycopg' extension\n    x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc -pthread -fno-strict-aliasing -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O2 -Wall Wstrict-prototypes -fPIC -DPSYCOPG_DEFAULT_PYDATETIME=1 -DPSYCOPG_VERSION=\"2.5.2 (dt dec pq3 ext)\" -DPG_VERSION_HEX=0x09010D -DPSYCOPG_EXTENSIONS=1 -DPSYCOPG_NEW_BOOLEAN=1 -DHAVE_PQFREEMEM=1 -I/usr/include/python2.7 -I. -I/usr/include/postgresql -I/usr/include/postgresql/9.1/server -c psycopg/psycopgmodule.c -o build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/psycopg/psycopgmodule.o -Wdeclaration-after-statement\n    In file included from psycopg/psycopgmodule.c:27:0:\n    ./psycopg/psycopg.h:30:20: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory\n     #include &lt;Python.h&gt;\n                    ^\n    compilation terminated.\n    error: command 'x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc' failed with exit status 1\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the Python development headers are not installed on your system. When you try to install certain Python packages, especially those that require compilation of C extensions (like `psycopg2`), you need to have the Python development files available.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Install Python Development Headers**: You need to install the `python-dev` package (or `python3-dev` if you are using Python 3). You can do this using `apt-get`:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install python-dev\n   ```\n\n   If you are using Python 3, replace `python-dev` with `python3-dev`:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install python3-dev\n   ```\n\n2. **Install PostgreSQL Development Libraries**: Since `psycopg2` is a PostgreSQL adapter, you also need the PostgreSQL development libraries:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install libpq-dev\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Gunicorn**: After fixing the development library issue, you should be able to install Gunicorn using pip without issues:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install gunicorn\n   ```\n\n4. **Re-attempt Installing Psycopg2**: With the development headers in place, try installing `psycopg2` again:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install psycopg2\n   ```\n\nAdditionally, ensure that your virtual environment is activated before you run the `pip install` commands. If you continue to experience issues, check for any additional error messages and ensure that your system is fully updated. Also, consider upgrading your Ubuntu version if possible, as 13.10 is quite outdated and may have compatibility issues with newer packages."
