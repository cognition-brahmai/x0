        "content": "In computer programming, the terms \"variable\" and \"constant\" refer to different ways of storing data values in a program. Here's how they differ:\n\n1. **Variable**:\n   - A variable is a storage location identified by a memory address and a symbolic name (an identifier), which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value.\n   - The value of a variable can change during the execution of a program. This means you can assign different values to a variable at different points in time.\n   - Variables are used when you need to store data that might change as the program runs, such as user input, results of calculations, or any other dynamic data.\n\n2. **Constant**:\n   - A constant is a value that cannot be altered by the program during its execution. Once a constant is defined, its value is set for the duration of the program.\n   - Constants are used to store values that are meant to remain the same throughout the program, such as mathematical constants (e.g., \u03c0), configuration settings, or fixed values that should not change.\n\nIn many programming languages, you define variables and constants differently. For example, in C++, you might use the `const` keyword to define a constant, whereas in Python, constants are usually just variables that are written in uppercase by convention to indicate that they shouldn\u2019t be changed.\n\n```cpp\n// C++ Example\nconst double PI = 3.14159; // Constant\nint radius = 5; // Variable\n```\n\n```python\n# Python Example\nPI = 3.14159  # Constant (by convention)\nradius = 5    # Variable\n```\n\nUsing constants can make your code more readable and maintainable, as it helps to communicate the intent that certain values should not change."
