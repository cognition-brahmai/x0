I am using the tiny 2-layer neural network example from http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/27/python-network-part2/. I have trained the Neural Network with a dataset that contains the following sequences: [0,1], [1,0], [0,0], and [1,1]. After training, I test the network and find that it accurately predicts the sequences [0,1], [1,0] and [1,1]. However, it is still unable to accurately predict the [0,0] sequence, returning a prediction of 0.5 which means the network is uncertain. Why is the Neural Network unable to learn the [0,0] sequence?"

        "content": "When a neural network has difficulty learning specific input patterns, such as the [0,0] sequence in your case, it might be due to a few factors. Let's explore some possible reasons and solutions:\n\n1. **Symmetry in Weights Initialization**: If the weights are initialized symmetrically (e.g., all zeros or with a symmetric pattern), it might cause the network to have difficulty distinguishing between different inputs, especially when they are similar like [0,0]. Make sure your weights are initialized randomly with a small variance to break this symmetry.\n\n2. **Activation Function Saturation**: If you're using an activation function like the sigmoid, it's possible for the function to saturate when inputs are zero, causing gradients to vanish. Consider using a different activation function like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), which is less prone to this issue.\n\n3. **Bias Terms**: Ensure that your network includes bias terms. Biases can help the network learn patterns that involve zero inputs, as they shift the activation function away from zero.\n\n4. **Training Data Imbalance**: Check if there's an imbalance in your training data where the [0,0] sequence might be underrepresented compared to others. Ensure that your training data is balanced and adequately represents all sequences.\n\n5. **Learning Rate**: A learning rate that's too high or too low can hinder learning. If it's too high, the network might skip over optimal solutions. If it's too low, learning might be too slow to make any noticeable progress. Experiment with different learning rates.\n\n6. **Network Capacity**: A 2-layer network might be too simplistic for your problem, especially if the input-output mapping is non-linear. Consider adding more units to your hidden layer or even adding another hidden layer to increase the network's capacity.\n\n7. **Overfitting**: Although overfitting is less likely with such a simple network, if your network is overfitting to the other sequences, it might not generalize well to the [0,0] input. Regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization can help mitigate overfitting.\n\nTry these solutions and observe if they help your network learn the [0,0] sequence effectively. Adjusting these parameters and network structure should guide you towards better performance."
