I'm trying to use Python's `zipfile` module but I'm struggling to understand it. Ultimately, I want to be able to extract and read the contents of the txt file, similar to this:\n\n```python\nf = open('my_txt_file.txt','r')\ncontents = f.read()\n```"

        "content": "To get a list of files contained in a zip file and read the contents of a specific file using Python's `zipfile` module, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the zip file using the `ZipFile` class.\n2. Use the `namelist()` method to get a list of all file names in the zip archive.\n3. Identify the text file you want to read.\n4. Use the `open()` method of the `ZipFile` class to open the desired file.\n5. Read the contents of the file.\n\nHere's a complete example:\n\n```python\nimport zipfile\n\n# Open the zip file\nwith zipfile.ZipFile('my_zip.zip', 'r') as zip_ref:\n    # List all file names in the zip archive\n    file_names = zip_ref.namelist()\n    \n    # Find the txt file (assuming there's only one)\n    txt_file_name = None\n    for file_name in file_names:\n        if file_name.endswith('.txt'):\n            txt_file_name = file_name\n            break\n    \n    # Check if a txt file was found\n    if txt_file_name:\n        # Open the txt file within the zip\n        with zip_ref.open(txt_file_name) as my_txt_file:\n            # Read the contents of the txt file\n            contents = my_txt_file.read().decode('utf-8')\n            # Print the contents\n            print(contents)\n    else:\n        print(\"No txt file found in the zip archive.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`zipfile.ZipFile('my_zip.zip', 'r')`**: Opens the zip file in read mode.\n- **`namelist()`**: Returns a list of all file names in the zip archive.\n- **`open(txt_file_name)`**: Opens the specified file within the zip archive.\n- **`read().decode('utf-8')`**: Reads the contents of the file and decodes it from bytes to a string (assuming the file is UTF-8 encoded).\n\nEnsure that you have the `zipfile` module available in your Python environment, which is included in the standard library. This script assumes that there's only one `.txt` file in the zip archive. If there are multiple, additional logic may be needed to handle them."
