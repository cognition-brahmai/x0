To do this, I have used the following command: \n\n```bash\n% pip freeze | grep pyobjc-framework | xargs pip uninstall \n```\n\nHowever, this approach is not working because each pip uninstall requires a confirmation. Is there a way to uninstall multiple packages with pip, bypassing the confirmation requirement? I would like to avoid having to uninstall each of these packages manually."

You can modify your command to include this option. Here's an updated version of your command:\n\n```bash\npip freeze | grep pyobjc-framework | xargs pip uninstall -y\n```\n\nThis command does the following:\n\n1. `pip freeze` lists all installed packages.\n2. `grep pyobjc-framework` filters the list to only include packages that start with \"pyobjc-framework\".\n3. `xargs pip uninstall -y` takes the filtered list and passes each package to `pip uninstall` with the `-y` flag, which automatically confirms the uninstallation.\n\nThis should allow you to uninstall all the specified packages without manual confirmation."
