This fallacy occurs when a conclusion is drawn from a sample that is too small or not representative of the whole population. In this case, assuming that the belief of all scientists can be determined from a small sample and then using that assumption to make a broader claim about the existence of God is a hasty generalization. Additionally, this argument might also involve an \"appeal to authority\" fallacy, where the opinion of scientists is used as the sole basis for the truth of a non-scientific claim, such as the existence of God, which is inherently a philosophical or theological question rather than a scientific one."
