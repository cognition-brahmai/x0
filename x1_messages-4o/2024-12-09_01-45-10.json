However, when I try to reopen it, I have to wait for about a minute before I can connect again. Is there a correct way to close a socket to avoid this delay? Or is this delay intended?"

        "content": "The delay you're experiencing is likely due to the socket being in the \"TIME_WAIT\" state. This is a normal part of the TCP connection lifecycle, where the socket is waiting to ensure that any delayed packets are properly handled before the ports can be reused.\n\nTo avoid having to wait, you can set the `SO_REUSEADDR` socket option on your server socket. This allows the socket to bind to an address that is in a `TIME_WAIT` state. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport socket\nimport signal\nimport sys\n\ndef signal_handler(sig, frame):\n    print('Interrupt received, closing socket.')\n    server_socket.close()\n    sys.exit(0)\n\n# Create a TCP/IP socket\nserver_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n\n# Set the SO_REUSEADDR option to allow immediate reuse of the address\nserver_socket.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)\n\n# Bind the socket to the address and port\nserver_address = ('localhost', 12345)\nserver_socket.bind(server_address)\n\n# Listen for incoming connections\nserver_socket.listen(1)\n\n# Register the signal handler for Ctrl-C\nsignal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)\n\nprint('Server is running. Press Ctrl-C to stop.')\n\ntry:\n    while True:\n        # Wait for a connection\n        connection, client_address = server_socket.accept()\n        try:\n            print(f'Connection from {client_address}')\n            # Handle the connection\n            while True:\n                data = connection.recv(1024)\n                if data:\n                    print(f'Received: {data}')\n                    connection.sendall(data)\n                else:\n                    break\n        finally:\n            connection.close()\n\nexcept KeyboardInterrupt:\n    print('Server stopped.')\n\nfinally:\n    server_socket.close()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1. `server_socket.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)` allows the server to rebind to the same address and port even if it's in the `TIME_WAIT` state.\n\n2. A signal handler is set up to close the socket cleanly when you interrupt the program with Ctrl-C.\n\nUsing `SO_REUSEADDR` is a common practice when developing network applications to allow for quicker restarts and development cycles. However, be cautious when using it in a production environment, as it can potentially lead to situations where multiple sockets are bound to the same address and port."
