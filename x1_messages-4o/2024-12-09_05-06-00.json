When I comment out the console logging code and leave only the file logging code to be used, it doesn't seem to log to the file as expected. Instead, it continues to log to the console. Could you help me find a solution for this? Here is my code:\n\nFor logging to Console:\n```\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO,\n        format='%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] (%(threadName)-10s) %(message)s',)\n```\n\nFor file logging\n```\nlogging.basicConfig(filename='server-soap.1.log',level=logging.INFO,\n        format='%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] (%(threadName)-10s) %(message)s')\n```"

        "content": "When you encounter issues with logging in Python, particularly when switching between console and file logging, it often boils down to how `logging.basicConfig()` is being called. This function can only be called once per session to configure the root logger. If it's called multiple times, only the first call has any effect. In your case, if the console logging was configured first and the file logging second, the file logging configuration would be ignored because the root logger is already configured.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can solve this problem:\n\n1. **Ensure `basicConfig()` is called once:** Make sure that `logging.basicConfig()` is called only once in your script. If you need to switch between console and file logging dynamically, you will need to handle it differently.\n\n2. **Clear existing handlers:** If you need to reconfigure logging, you can remove existing handlers before calling `basicConfig()` again. Here is how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\n# Remove all handlers associated with the root logger object.\nfor handler in logging.root.handlers[:]:\n    logging.root.removeHandler(handler)\n\n# Now configure logging to a file\nlogging.basicConfig(\n    filename='server-soap.1.log',\n    level=logging.INFO,\n    format='%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] (%(threadName)-10s) %(message)s'\n)\n```\n\n3. **Use custom handlers:** If you need more flexible logging (e.g., logging to both console and file at different times), you can manually add handlers to the logger. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\n# Create a custom logger\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n# Create handlers\nfile_handler = logging.FileHandler('server-soap.1.log')\nconsole_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\n\n# Set level and format for file handler\nfile_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)\nfile_handler.setFormatter(logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] (%(threadName)-10s) %(message)s'))\n\n# Set level and format for console handler (if needed)\nconsole_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)\nconsole_handler.setFormatter(logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] (%(threadName)-10s) %(message)s'))\n\n# Add handlers to the logger\nlogger.addHandler(file_handler)\n# Comment out the next line if you don't want console logging\n# logger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\n# Example usage\nlogger.info('This is a log message!')\n```\n\nIn this example, you can easily control whether to log to the console or file by commenting or uncommenting the relevant handler in the code. This approach gives you more flexibility and control over your logging configuration."
