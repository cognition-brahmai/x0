I have some understanding of using the `.find` method for this task, but I am unsure how to incorporate it into an `if` statement. Ideally, I would like to achieve something along the lines of:\n\n```python\nif string.find(word):\n    print(\"success\")\n```\n\nCould someone help me understand how to correctly use the `.find` method within an `if` statement?"

        "content": "Certainly! The `.find()` method is used to locate the position of a substring within a string. If the substring is found, `.find()` returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring. If the substring is not found, it returns `-1`.\n\nWhen incorporating `.find()` into an `if` statement, you need to check if the result is not equal to `-1`. This is because a return value of `-1` indicates that the substring was not found.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nstring = \"your_example_string_here\"\nword = \"word_to_find\"\n\nif string.find(word) != -1:\n    print(\"success\")\nelse:\n    print(\"not found\")\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `in` keyword, which is more Pythonic and often preferred for checking the existence of a substring within a string:\n\n```python\nif word in string:\n    print(\"success\")\nelse:\n    print(\"not found\")\n```\n\nBoth approaches will help you determine whether a particular word exists within a string. The `in` keyword is generally recommended for readability and simplicity."
