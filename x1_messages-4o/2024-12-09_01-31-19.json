This is because decision trees evaluate attributes independently at each node to determine the best split for that particular subset of data. If an attribute provides valuable information for splitting the data at different points in the tree, it can be reused multiple times in different branches. This flexibility allows decision trees to capture complex patterns and interactions in the data."
