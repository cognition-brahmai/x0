The error message indicates that it can't find the file path '/Users/donbeo/Documents/phd_code/prova.py' on my remote machine. I created this file with PyCharm on my local machine and I was expecting PyCharm to synchronize between the local and remote machine.

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that the file path specified in the error message is a local path on your MacBook, which does not exist on the remote Ubuntu server. To resolve this issue, you'll need to ensure that the code files are synchronized between your local machine and the remote server. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to solve this:\n\n1. **Remote Interpreter Configuration:**\n   - First, ensure that you have correctly set up the remote interpreter in PyCharm. Go to `Preferences` (or `Settings` on Windows/Linux) > `Project: [Your Project Name]` > `Python Interpreter`.\n   - Click on the gear icon and select `Add...` to add a new interpreter.\n   - Choose `SSH Interpreter` and provide the necessary SSH details (host, port, username, and authentication method).\n\n2. **Deployment Configuration:**\n   - In PyCharm, navigate to `Preferences` (or `Settings` on Windows/Linux) > `Build, Execution, Deployment` > `Deployment`.\n   - Add a new deployment configuration by clicking the `+` button and select `SFTP`.\n   - Enter the connection details (host, port, username, password/key) to connect to your remote server.\n   - In the `Mappings` tab, set the `Local path` to the directory on your MacBook where your project resides. Set the `Deployment path` to the directory on the remote server where you want the files to be synced.\n\n3. **Automatic Upload:**\n   - Still in the Deployment configuration, go to the `Options` tab and check `Upload changed files automatically to the default server`.\n   - This setting ensures that every time you make changes to your local files, PyCharm will automatically upload them to the remote server.\n\n4. **Synchronize Files:**\n   - Manually synchronize the project initially by right-clicking on the project folder in the Project tool window and selecting `Deployment` > `Upload to [Your Server Name]`.\n\n5. **Run Configuration:**\n   - Set up a new run configuration for your project by going to `Run` > `Edit Configurations`.\n   - Add a new `Python` configuration and make sure you select the remote interpreter you configured earlier.\n\n6. **Test Execution:**\n   - Once everything is set up, try running your script again. PyCharm should now be able to find the file on the remote server and execute it using the remote interpreter.\n\nBy following these steps, your local files should be correctly synchronized with the remote server, and you should be able to run your Python scripts remotely without encountering the file path error."
