Subtract 1 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant on the left side:\n   \\[\n   2x + 1 - 1 = 7 - 1\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2x = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2x}{2} = \\frac{6}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 3\n   \\]\n\nSo, the solution to the equation \\(2x + 1 = 7\\) is \\(x = 3\\)."
