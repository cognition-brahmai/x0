Here's a function that does exactly that:\n\n```javascript\nfunction sumArray(arr) {\n    return arr.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue, 0);\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nconst sum = sumArray(numbers);\nconsole.log(sum); // Output: 15\n```\n\nIn this function, `reduce()` is used to iterate over the array. The `accumulator` keeps track of the running total, and `currentValue` represents each element in the array as the function iterates. The initial value of the accumulator is set to 0, which is specified as the second argument to `reduce()`."
