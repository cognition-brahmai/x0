The code I'm using is `sns.histplot(train, x = \"Age\", hue=\"Sex\")`. However, I'm encountering an error: `AttributeError: module 'seaborn' has no attribute 'histplot'`. I've already imported seaborn and other plots using `sns.barplot` have worked fine. I'm currently running on Mac OS X 10.15.6, and using Seaborn version 0.11.0. Can anyone help me figure out what's going wrong?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is likely due to the version of Seaborn you are using. The `histplot` function was introduced in Seaborn version 0.11.0, so if you are indeed using this version and still getting the error, there might be a mismatch between the installed version and the version being used in your environment.\n\nHere's how you can troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify the Seaborn Version:**\n   Ensure that you are indeed running Seaborn version 0.11.0. You can check the version of Seaborn installed in your Jupyter Notebook by executing the following command:\n\n   ```python\n   import seaborn as sns\n   print(sns.__version__)\n   ```\n\n   If the version is not 0.11.0 or higher, you need to upgrade Seaborn.\n\n2. **Upgrade Seaborn:**\n   If the version is lower than 0.11.0, you should upgrade Seaborn to the latest version. You can do this via pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install seaborn --upgrade\n   ```\n\n   Or if you're using Anaconda, you can update it with:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda update seaborn\n   ```\n\n3. **Restart Jupyter Notebook:**\n   After upgrading, make sure to restart your Jupyter Notebook kernel to ensure the changes take effect.\n\n4. **Check Import Statements:**\n   Double-check your import statements to make sure that the correct module is being imported without any typos:\n\n   ```python\n   import seaborn as sns\n   ```\n\n5. **Remove Any Conflicting Versions:**\n   Sometimes, conflicts between installed packages can cause issues. Make sure there are no multiple versions of Seaborn installed in different environments.\n\nAfter making sure you have the correct version installed and everything is set up correctly, try running your code again:\n\n```python\nsns.histplot(train, x=\"Age\", hue=\"Sex\")\n```\n\nIf you've followed these steps and are still encountering issues, feel free to provide additional details, and I\u2019ll be glad to help further!"
