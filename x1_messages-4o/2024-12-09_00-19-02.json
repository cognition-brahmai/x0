This will open the Startup folder.\n   - Move or copy the shortcut you created into this folder.\n\n3. **Test the Configuration:**\n   - Restart your computer to ensure that the Python script runs automatically.\n\n### Method 2: Using Task Scheduler\n\n1. **Open Task Scheduler:**\n   - Press `Win + S`, type \"Task Scheduler,\" and press Enter.\n\n2. **Create a New Task:**\n   - In the Task Scheduler window, click on \"Create Task\" in the Actions pane on the right.\n\n3. **General Settings:**\n   - Give your task a name and, optionally, a description.\n   - Select \"Run whether user is logged on or not\" if you want the task to run in the background.\n\n4. **Trigger:**\n   - Go to the \"Triggers\" tab and click \"New.\"\n   - Choose \"At startup\" from the \"Begin the task\" dropdown menu and click OK.\n\n5. **Action:**\n   - Go to the \"Actions\" tab and click \"New.\"\n   - Choose \"Start a program\" as the action.\n   - In the \"Program/script\" field, enter the path to your Python executable (e.g., `C:\\Python39\\python.exe`).\n   - In the \"Add arguments\" field, enter the path to your Python script (e.g., `C:\\Path\\To\\YourScript.py`).\n   - Click OK.\n\n6. **Conditions and Settings:**\n   - Adjust any conditions or settings according to your needs, such as ensuring the task only runs if a network connection is available.\n\n7. **Save and Test:**\n   - Click OK to save the task.\n   - You may be prompted to enter your password to authorize the task.\n   - Restart your computer to test the setup.\n\nBy following these methods, your Python script should run automatically every time your Windows system starts up."
