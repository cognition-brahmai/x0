        "content": "To calculate the total calories, fat content, and protein levels in a microwave-safe mug cake recipe using Ruby, you can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Gather Nutrient Data\nFirst, you need the nutrient data for each ingredient in your recipe. This typically includes calories, fat, and protein per a specific unit (like per 100g or per tablespoon). You can find this information on food packaging, nutrition databases, or websites.\n\n### Step 2: Create the Formula\nYou need to create a formula in Ruby that calculates the total nutrients based on the quantities of each ingredient.\n\nHere is a basic Ruby script to perform these calculations:\n\n```ruby\n# Define the nutrient data for each ingredient\nnutrient_data = {\n  \"flour\" => { calories: 364, fat: 1, protein: 10 }, # per 100g\n  \"sugar\" => { calories: 387, fat: 0, protein: 0 }, # per 100g\n  \"cocoa_powder\" => { calories: 228, fat: 14, protein: 20 }, # per 100g\n  \"milk\" => { calories: 42, fat: 1, protein: 3 }, # per 100ml\n  \"egg\" => { calories: 155, fat: 11, protein: 13 }, # per egg\n  \"butter\" => { calories: 717, fat: 81, protein: 1 }, # per 100g\n}\n\n# Define the quantities of each ingredient used in the recipe\nrecipe_quantities = {\n  \"flour\" => 20, # in grams\n  \"sugar\" => 15, # in grams\n  \"cocoa_powder\" => 10, # in grams\n  \"milk\" => 50, # in ml\n  \"egg\" => 0.5, # half an egg\n  \"butter\" => 10, # in grams\n}\n\n# Define a method to calculate the total nutrients\ndef calculate_nutrients(nutrient_data, recipe_quantities)\n  total_calories = 0\n  total_fat = 0\n  total_protein = 0\n\n  recipe_quantities.each do |ingredient, quantity|\n    nutrient_info = nutrient_data[ingredient]\n    total_calories += (nutrient_info[:calories] * quantity / 100.0)\n    total_fat += (nutrient_info[:fat] * quantity / 100.0)\n    total_protein += (nutrient_info[:protein] * quantity / 100.0)\n  end\n\n  { calories: total_calories, fat: total_fat, protein: total_protein }\nend\n\n# Calculate the total nutrients for the recipe\ntotal_nutrients = calculate_nutrients(nutrient_data, recipe_quantities)\n\nputs \"Total Calories: #{total_nutrients[:calories]}\"\nputs \"Total Fat: #{total_nutrients[:fat]}g\"\nputs \"Total Protein: #{total_nutrients[:protein]}g\"\n```\n\n### Step 3: Ingredient Substitutions\nHere are some common ingredient substitutions along with their nutrient data:\n\n1. **Flour Substitutions:**\n   - Almond flour: Lower in carbs, higher in fat and protein.\n   - Oat flour: Higher in fiber.\n\n2. **Sugar Substitutions:**\n   - Honey: Slightly more calories, some vitamins and minerals.\n   - Stevia: No calories, natural sugar substitute.\n\n3. **Butter Substitutions:**\n   - Coconut oil: Similar fat content, different flavor.\n   - Applesauce: Reduces fat, adds moisture.\n\n4. **Milk Substitutions:**\n   - Almond milk: Lower in calories, less protein.\n   - Soy milk: Similar protein content, lower in calories.\n\nTo incorporate these substitutions into your calculations, update the `nutrient_data` hash with the corresponding values for the substituted ingredients.\n\n### Example Substitution Data:\n```ruby\nnutrient_data[\"almond_flour\"] = { calories: 576, fat: 50, protein: 21 } # per 100g\nnutrient_data[\"honey\"] = { calories: 304, fat: 0, protein: 0 } # per 100g\nnutrient_data[\"coconut_oil\"] = { calories: 862, fat: 100, protein: 0 } # per 100g\nnutrient_data[\"almond_milk\"] = { calories: 15, fat: 1, protein: 1 } # per 100ml\n```\n\n### Step 4: Adjust Recipe Quantities\nWhen using substitutions, make sure to adjust the quantities appropriately, as some ingredients may have different densities or sweetness levels. Update the `recipe_quantities` hash accordingly.\n\nWith this approach, you can easily calculate the nutritional content of your mug cake recipe and make adjustments for dietary needs and preferences."
