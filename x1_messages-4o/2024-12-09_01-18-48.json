However, when I run the resultant `main.exe` file in the `/dist/main` directory, I encounter an `OSError: could not get source code` error. The error seems to be connected to the `torch` or `torchvision` modules. I have recently installed Visual Studio 2019 and am running on Windows 10 with Python 3.7, torch-1.1.0 and torchvision-0.3.0. In addition, the issue seems to be related to the `FrozenBatchNorm2d` class in torchvision. Even when I copy all the torch source files, I still get the same error. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with PyInstaller and the `torchvision` library is a known problem when trying to package a Python script into an executable. The `OSError: could not get source code` error typically occurs because PyInstaller cannot find or properly package all the necessary files and resources needed by the libraries, especially with complex packages like `torch` and `torchvision`.\n\nHere are several steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Use the Latest Version of Libraries**: Ensure you are using the latest versions of `torch` and `torchvision`. There may have been bug fixes or improvements that address the issue you're encountering. You can upgrade these packages using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade torch torchvision\n   ```\n\n2. **PyInstaller Hidden Imports**: PyInstaller sometimes fails to detect all dependencies, especially for complex modules. You can manually specify hidden imports in your `.spec` file or via the command line using the `--hidden-import` option. For example:\n   ```bash\n   pyinstaller --hidden-import=torchvision.ops --hidden-import=torch --onefile main.py\n   ```\n\n3. **Adjust the `.spec` File**: You might need to adjust the `.spec` file generated by PyInstaller to include any missing files or data that `torchvision` relies on. Modify the `Analysis` block to include additional hidden imports or data files.\n\n4. **Include Additional Data Files**: If `torchvision` requires certain data files that are not being included, you can specify them in your `.spec` file:\n   ```python\n   datas=[('path/to/torchvision/data', 'torchvision/data')],\n   ```\n\n5. **Dynamic Imports**: Sometimes dynamically imported modules are not detected by PyInstaller. You can explicitly import them in your `main.py` to ensure they are included:\n   ```python\n   import torchvision.ops\n    \n   # Your existing code\n   ```\n\n6. **Debug the PyInstaller Build**: Use the `--debug` option with PyInstaller to get more information about what might be going wrong:\n   ```bash\n   pyinstaller --debug=all main.py\n   ```\n\n7. **Check for Compatibility**: Ensure that your `torch` and `torchvision` versions are compatible with your Python version. Since you're using Python 3.7, make sure that the versions of these libraries support it.\n\n8. **Experiment with Different PyInstaller Options**: Sometimes using different PyInstaller options helps, such as:\n   - `--onefile`: Create a single bundled executable.\n   - `--noconsole`: If you do not need a console window.\n\n9. **Consult PyInstaller and Library Documentation**: Check the PyInstaller documentation and GitHub issues for any known workarounds or fixes related to packaging `torch` and `torchvision`.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve your issue, consider seeking help on community forums or filing an issue with the PyInstaller or `torchvision` maintainers, providing them with detailed information about your setup and the error."
