Even though I've installed Python 3.7 and am able to install modules using pip, these modules seem to be installed for a previous version of Python. Whenever I try to import these modules, I receive a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'xx'` error. When I try to install the module using `python3.7 -m pip install module`, I get a `/usr/local/bin/python3.7: no module named pip` error. How can I rectify this?"

        "content": "To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that `pip` is specifically set up for your Python 3.7 installation on Ubuntu 18.04. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Install Python 3.7 and pip for Python 3.7:**\n\n   First, make sure you have Python 3.7 installed. You can do this by adding the deadsnakes PPA, which contains more recent Python versions:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa\n   sudo apt update\n   sudo apt install python3.7 python3.7-distutils python3.7-venv\n   ```\n\n   The `python3.7-distutils` package is required for installing pip.\n\n2. **Download and install `get-pip.py`:**\n\n   If `pip` is not installed for Python 3.7, you can use the `get-pip.py` script to install it:\n\n   ```bash\n   curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py\n   ```\n\n3. **Run `get-pip.py` with Python 3.7:**\n\n   Execute the script using Python 3.7 to install pip specifically for this version:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.7 get-pip.py\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify the Installation:**\n\n   Check that pip is installed for Python 3.7 by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.7 -m pip --version\n   ```\n\n   This should confirm the pip installation for Python 3.7.\n\n5. **Install Modules Using Python 3.7's pip:**\n\n   Now you can install your modules using pip specifically for Python 3.7:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.7 -m pip install <module_name>\n   ```\n\n6. **Verify Module Installation:**\n\n   You can test your installation by starting Python 3.7 and trying to import the module:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.7\n   >>> import <module_name>\n   ```\n\nThis process should resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError` by ensuring that pip installs modules for the correct Python version."
