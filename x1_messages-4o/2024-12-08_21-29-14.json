        "content": "Certainly! Let's create a Python program to find the second smallest number in a list of integers without using any built-in functions or libraries. The program will include a function to handle duplicates and return the second smallest number.\n\n### Algorithm Explanation\n\n1. **Initialize Two Variables**: We will maintain two variables, `first` and `second`, to track the smallest and second smallest numbers. Initially, set both to a very large value (or the maximum possible integer).\n\n2. **Traverse the List**: Iterate over each element in the list.\n   - If an element is smaller than `first`, update `second` to be the current value of `first`, and then update `first` to the current element.\n   - If an element is not equal to `first` and is smaller than `second`, update `second` to the current element.\n\n3. **Handle Edge Cases**: If the list has fewer than two distinct numbers, return an appropriate message or handle the situation as needed.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is \\(O(n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the length of the list. This is because we are iterating over the list once to find the second smallest number.\n\n### Python Program\n\n```python\ndef find_second_smallest(nums):\n    if len(nums) < 2:\n        return \"List must contain at least two distinct numbers.\"\n\n    # Initialize the first and second smallest to a large value\n    first = float('inf')\n    second = float('inf')\n\n    # Traverse the list\n    for num in nums:\n        if num < first:\n            # Update second and first\n            second = first\n            first = num\n        elif num != first and num < second:\n            # Update second\n            second = num\n\n    # If second is still infinity, it means there's no second smallest\n    if second == float('inf'):\n        return \"List must contain at least two distinct numbers.\"\n\n    return second\n\n# Example usage\nnums = [4, 2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 1]\nprint(\"Second smallest number is:\", find_second_smallest(nums))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Initialization**: We set both `first` and `second` to infinity to ensure any number in the list will be smaller initially.\n- **Loop Logic**: By checking each number, we ensure that `first` holds the smallest number and `second` holds the second smallest number by the end of the loop.\n- **Handling Duplicates**: The condition `num != first` ensures that duplicates of the smallest number do not affect the determination of the second smallest number.\n- **Edge Cases**: If `second` remains infinity, it indicates that there are not enough distinct numbers in the list to determine a second smallest number.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the second smallest number without using any built-in functions."
