From this table, identify a specific record that meets the following criteria: it was released as a single, has a music video, and features at least one other artist. Once you have identified this record, provide a brief analysis of its lyrics and explain how it showcases Lady Gaga's unique style and artistic vision. Additionally, provide a code snippet that demonstrates how you accessed the Spotify API and retrieved the necessary data."

        "content": "To accomplish this task, you will need to interact with the Spotify Web API to access Lady Gaga's discography. Here's a step-by-step guide, along with a code snippet, to help you retrieve the necessary data and identify a specific record that meets the given criteria.\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Spotify API Access\n\n1. **Register Your Application**: Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and create a new application to get your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.\n\n2. **Access Token**: Use your `Client ID` and `Client Secret` to get an access token. You can do this via the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Flow.\n\n### Step 2: Retrieve Lady Gaga's Discography\n\nHere's a Python code snippet using the `spotipy` library to access the Spotify API:\n\n```python\nimport spotipy\nfrom spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyClientCredentials\n\n# Set up Spotify API credentials\nclient_id = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID'\nclient_secret = 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'\n\n# Authenticate with Spotify\nclient_credentials_manager = SpotifyClientCredentials(client_id=client_id, client_secret=client_secret)\nsp = spotipy.Spotify(client_credentials_manager=client_credentials_manager)\n\n# Function to get artist's discography\ndef get_artist_discography(artist_name):\n    # Search for the artist\n    results = sp.search(q='artist:' + artist_name, type='artist')\n    artist_id = results['artists']['items'][0]['id']\n\n    # Get artist's albums\n    albums = sp.artist_albums(artist_id, album_type='album,single')\n    all_albums = albums['items']\n\n    # Collect album details\n    discography = []\n    for album in all_albums:\n        album_details = {\n            'name': album['name'],\n            'release_date': album['release_date'],\n            'total_tracks': album['total_tracks'],\n            'album_type': album['album_type'],\n            'url': album['external_urls']['spotify']\n        }\n        discography.append(album_details)\n\n    return discography\n\n# Fetch Lady Gaga's discography\nlady_gaga_discography = get_artist_discography('Lady Gaga')\n```\n\n### Step 3: Identify Specific Record\n\nManually filter the retrieved discography to find a single that has a music video and features another artist. One such record is \"Rain on Me\" by Lady Gaga featuring Ariana Grande.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Lyrics of \"Rain on Me\"\n\n\"Rain on Me\" is a powerful dance-pop anthem that combines themes of resilience and liberation. The lyrics reflect a sense of empowerment and overcoming adversity with lines emphasizing the importance of perseverance and emotional release. The collaboration with Ariana Grande enhances the song's dynamic and energetic style, showcasing Lady Gaga's ability to blend her unique artistic vision with other artists.\n\n### Step 5: Code Snippet to Retrieve a Specific Record\n\nHere's an example snippet to identify a track with specific features:\n\n```python\ndef find_featured_single_with_video(discography):\n    for album in discography:\n        if album['album_type'] == 'single':\n            # Assume you have checked and verified the music video and feature conditions manually\n            if album['name'] == 'Rain on Me':\n                return album\n    return None\n\n# Identify specific record\nspecific_record = find_featured_single_with_video(lady_gaga_discography)\n\nif specific_record:\n    print(f\"Found record: {specific_record['name']} released on {specific_record['release_date']}\")\n    print(f\"Spotify URL: {specific_record['url']}\")\n```\n\nThis script provides a framework to interact with the Spotify API and identify a track like \"Rain on Me.\" You may need to cross-reference with platforms like YouTube or music video databases to confirm the presence of a music video."
