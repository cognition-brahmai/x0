        "content": "To match text between two specified strings using a regular expression in Python 2.x, you can use the `re` module. In your case, you want to extract text between \"Part 1\" and \"Part 3\". You can use the following regular expression pattern to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ntext = \"Part 1. Part 2. Part 3 then more text\"\npattern = r'Part 1(.*?)Part 3'\n\nmatch = re.search(pattern, text)\n\nif match:\n    result = match.group(1)\n    print(\"Matched text:\", result)\nelse:\n    print(\"No match found\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- `Part 1` and `Part 3` are the strings you want to match around.\n- `(.*?)` is a non-greedy match for any character (`.`) zero or more times (`*`). The `?` makes it non-greedy, so it matches the shortest possible string between \"Part 1\" and \"Part 3\".\n- `re.search()` is used to find the first match of the pattern in the text. If a match is found, `match.group(1)` extracts the content captured by the parentheses, which is the text between \"Part 1\" and \"Part 3\".\n\nThis should give you the desired output of \". Part 2. \"."
