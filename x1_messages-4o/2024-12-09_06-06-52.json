    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The `ImportError` you're encountering is due to changes in the Pandas library. The function `is_list_like` was moved in Pandas version 0.23.0 and later, which means that the `pandas_datareader` library you're using is likely outdated and is trying to import `is_list_like` from a location where it no longer exists.\n\nHere are the steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Upgrade Pandas DataReader**: Ensure that you have the latest version of `pandas_datareader`. You can upgrade it using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade pandas-datareader\n   ```\n\n   This will ensure you have the latest version which should be compatible with the newer versions of Pandas.\n\n2. **Check Your Pandas Version**: Make sure your Pandas library is also up to date:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade pandas\n   ```\n\n3. **Check Compatibility**: If you are using a specific version of Pandas that is not the latest, ensure that the version of `pandas_datareader` you are using is compatible with your Pandas version. You can check the documentation or release notes for any compatibility issues.\n\n4. **Workaround**: If upgrading doesn't resolve the issue and you are constrained to use specific versions, you can try to patch the `pandas_datareader` library by editing the `fred.py` file to import `is_list_like` from the correct location. You can change the import statement in `fred.py` from:\n\n   ```python\n   from pandas.core.common import is_list_like\n   ```\n\n   to:\n\n   ```python\n   from pandas.api.types import is_list_like\n   ```\n\n   This is generally not recommended for long-term use but can be a quick fix while you work on upgrading your libraries.\n\nAfter upgrading, try running your script again to see if the issue is resolved. If the error persists, ensure there are no version conflicts by checking the installed versions of both `pandas` and `pandas_datareader` and adjust as necessary."
