The code attempts to open a URL, and if it is successful, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. I am concerned about the effectiveness of this code, especially in situations where the user might have a slow internet connection that takes more than 20 seconds to respond. How can I improve this Python script to be more effective across a broad spectrum of internet connection qualities?\n\nHere is my current code:\n\n```python\nimport urllib2\n\ndef internet_on():\n    try:\n        response=urllib2.urlopen('http://74.125.228.100',timeout=20)\n        return True\n    except urllib2.URLError as err: pass\n    return False\n```"

        "content": "To improve your Python script to handle a broader range of internet connection qualities, you can make the following enhancements:\n\n1. **Use `requests` library**: The `requests` library is more modern and user-friendly compared to `urllib2`. It simplifies the process of making HTTP requests and gives you additional features.\n\n2. **Retry mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism to attempt multiple connections before concluding that there is no internet connection. This can help in situations where there are temporary network issues.\n\n3. **Flexible timeout**: Consider using a shorter timeout and multiple retries instead of a long single attempt. This can make your script more responsive, especially in cases where the network is slow.\n\n4. **User feedback**: Provide feedback to the user while the script is trying to establish a connection. This can be helpful if the connection takes some time.\n\nHere's an enhanced version of your script using the `requests` library:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom requests.exceptions import RequestException\nimport time\n\ndef internet_on(url='http://www.google.com', timeout=5, retries=3):\n    for attempt in range(retries):\n        try:\n            # Attempt to connect to the URL\n            response = requests.get(url, timeout=timeout)\n            # Check if the response was successful (status code 200)\n            if response.status_code == 200:\n                return True\n        except RequestException as err:\n            # Print error for debugging purposes (optional)\n            print(f\"Attempt {attempt + 1} failed: {err}\")\n        \n        # Wait for a bit before retrying\n        time.sleep(2)\n    \n    return False\n\n# Example usage\nif internet_on():\n    print(\"Internet is on\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No internet connection\")\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- **Switched to `requests`**: This library is more intuitive to use and widely adopted.\n- **Retries and Timeout**: Added a retry mechanism with a configurable number of attempts and a shorter timeout. This balances responsiveness and reliability.\n- **Feedback**: Optional print statements provide feedback on the connection attempts.\n\nYou can adjust `url`, `timeout`, and `retries` parameters based on your specific requirements or network conditions."
