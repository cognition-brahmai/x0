In your case, you want to create a new list that only includes strings that contain the substring `'ab'`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Original list\nstrings = ['a', 'ab', 'abc', 'bac']\n\n# Filtered list using a list comprehension\nfiltered_list = [s for s in strings if 'ab' in s]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(filtered_list)\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n\n```\n['ab', 'abc']\n```\n\nThe list comprehension `[s for s in strings if 'ab' in s]` iterates over each string `s` in the original list `strings`, and includes `s` in the `filtered_list` only if `'ab'` is a substring of `s`."
