        "content": "Yes, there are several Python libraries that can convert a JSON schema into Python class definitions. One popular library for this purpose is **`pydantic`**, which is used to define data models using Python type annotations. Although `pydantic` itself doesn't directly convert JSON schemas to Python classes, it is often used in conjunction with other tools to achieve this.\n\nAnother tool you might find useful is **`datamodel-code-generator`**, which can generate Pydantic models from JSON Schema, OpenAPI, JSON, and other data formats. Here's how you can use it:\n\n1. Install `datamodel-code-generator` using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install datamodel-code-generator\n   ```\n\n2. Use the generator to create Python classes from a JSON schema:\n\n   ```bash\n   datamodel-codegen --input your-schema.json --output models.py\n   ```\n\nThis command will read your JSON schema from `your-schema.json` and generate a Python file `models.py` with Pydantic models.\n\nAdditionally, you might want to explore **`jsonschema2dj`**, which generates Django models from JSON Schema, if you're working within a Django project.\n\nThese tools should help you convert JSON schemas into Python class definitions effectively."
