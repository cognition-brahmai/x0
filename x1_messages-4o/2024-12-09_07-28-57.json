I have already installed Python 3.8 using the PPA 'deadsnakes/ppa' and updated the python command to point to Python 3.8 instead of Python 2. However, when I try to install pip using 'python3-pip', it installs pip for Python 3.6 (since python3 still points to Python 3.6.9) and I want to keep it that way. If I try 'python-pip', it installs pip for Python 2.7, and 'python3.8-pip' does not seem to exist as I get the output 'E: Unable to locate package python3.8-pip', 'E: Couldn't find any package by glob 'python3.8-pip', 'E: Couldn't find any package by regex 'python3.8-pip'. What is the correct way to install pip specifically for Python 3.8?"

Just make sure it's correctly installed.\n\n2. **Download get-pip.py**: This script will help you install pip for a specific version of Python.\n\n   ```bash\n   curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py\n   ```\n\n3. **Install pip for Python 3.8**: Use Python 3.8 to run the `get-pip.py` script. This will install pip specifically for Python 3.8.\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.8 get-pip.py\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify the installation**: Once installed, you can verify that pip for Python 3.8 is correctly installed by checking its version.\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.8 -m pip --version\n   ```\n\n5. **Clean up**: Optionally, you can remove the `get-pip.py` file once pip is installed.\n\n   ```bash\n   rm get-pip.py\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should have pip installed specifically for Python 3.8 without altering the default Python 3 version or its pip installation."
