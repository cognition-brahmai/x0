I have attempted to overlap kernel executions with memcpyasync, but it doesn't seem to work despite following all recommendations in the programming guide, such as using pinned memory, different streams, and so on. Kernel execution does overlap, but not with memory transfers. My card only has one copy engine and one execution engine, but I was under the impression that execution and transfers should overlap. Why does the \"copy engine\" and \"execution engine\" always enforce the order I call the functions?"

        "content": "The GTX 480, based on the Fermi architecture, has certain limitations when it comes to overlapping data transfers and computation. While it is possible to achieve overlapping, there are a few nuances that might prevent it from happening effectively:\n\n1. **Single Copy Engine**: The GTX 480 has only one copy engine, which means it can only perform one data transfer operation at a time (either host-to-device or device-to-host). This can limit the ability to overlap multiple data transfers with kernel execution.\n\n2. **Stream Prioritization**: Ensure that you are using different CUDA streams for your asynchronous operations. By default, operations in the same stream are serialized. You should explicitly create and use separate streams for different operations to enable concurrency.\n\n3. **Pinned Memory**: You've mentioned using pinned memory, which is indeed a requirement for achieving overlap. However, ensure that all memory transfers are using pinned (page-locked) memory, as pageable memory transfers are synchronous.\n\n4. **Kernel Launch Latency**: The latency in launching kernels or memory transfers can sometimes affect the overlap. It might help to have a larger workload that allows for better hiding of such latencies.\n\n5. **CUDA Driver and Runtime**: Ensure that both your CUDA driver and runtime are up to date. Sometimes, driver updates can improve performance or provide fixes for such issues.\n\n6. **Workload Characteristics**: The nature of your workload might also impact the ability to overlap. If your kernels are very short or your data transfers are very small, the overhead might outweigh the benefits of overlapping.\n\n7. **Profiling and Debugging**: Use tools like NVIDIA Visual Profiler (nvprof) or Nsight Systems to analyze your application's behavior. These tools can help you visualize the timeline of operations and identify where the overlap isn't occurring as expected.\n\n8. **Correct Synchronization**: Ensure that there is no unintended synchronization between streams, such as implicit synchronizations that might occur due to things like accessing device memory in a different stream without proper synchronization.\n\nIf, after checking these factors, you still cannot achieve the desired overlap, it might be a limitation of the hardware architecture itself. In such cases, optimizing the kernel execution time or restructuring the data transfer pattern might be necessary to achieve overall performance improvements."
