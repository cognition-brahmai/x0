        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to an incompatibility between the versions of TensorFlow, TensorBoard, and PyTorch's TensorBoard SummaryWriter. Let's try to address the issue step by step:\n\n### Solution:\n\n1. **TensorFlow Version**: It seems like there is a conflict with TensorFlow 1.x versions and TensorBoard 2.x. Since you're using TensorFlow 1.15.0, it's better to align the TensorBoard version accordingly.\n\n2. **TensorBoard Compatibility**: TensorBoard 2.x might not be fully compatible with TensorFlow 1.x. Try downgrading TensorBoard to a version that works well with TensorFlow 1.15.0.\n\n3. **Use Correct TensorBoard Writer**: Since you're using PyTorch, ensure you're using the `torch.utils.tensorboard.SummaryWriter` correctly. It's independent of TensorFlow, but it can have issues if the environment has conflicting TensorFlow and TensorBoard versions.\n\n### Steps to Fix:\n\n1. **Install Compatible Versions**:\n   ```bash\n   !pip install tensorflow==1.15.0\n   !pip install tensorboard==1.15.0\n   ```\n\n2. **Restart the Kernel**: After installing, restart your Colab runtime to ensure that the new versions are loaded.\n\n3. **Update Code**:\n   - Ensure that your code is not inadvertently using TensorFlow's TensorBoard functionalities. Use PyTorch's `SummaryWriter` explicitly.\n\n4. **Check TensorFlow Import**: If TensorFlow is not necessary for your task, you might not need to import it when using PyTorch's TensorBoard. Check if removing TensorFlow dependencies from your code is possible.\n\n5. **Run TensorBoard Independently**:\n   - Use the command `%tensorboard --logdir logs` to visualize without loading TensorFlow. If you encounter issues, try the following:\n   ```python\n   from tensorboard import notebook\n   notebook.start(\"--logdir logs\")\n   ```\n\n6. **If Issues Persist**: If the above steps don't resolve the issue, consider using a newer environment setup with TensorFlow 2.x, PyTorch 1.4+, and TensorBoard 2.x. You might need to update the code for compatibility with TensorFlow 2.x if needed.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\n- **Colab Environment**: Ensure that your Colab environment is not loading default packages that might conflict. You can check the installed versions using `!pip list`.\n\n- **Code Execution**: Ensure the paths and data are correctly set before calling the `add_embedding` method. Verify the shapes and types of the data being passed.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the compatibility issue and successfully visualize embeddings using TensorBoard in Google Colab."
