However, when stopped at certain breakpoints, the Debugger window gets stuck at \"Collecting data\", which eventually times out with \"Unable to display frame variables\". The data to be displayed is neither special nor particularly large. It is available to PyCharm as a conditional breakpoint on some values of the said data works fine, but the process to gather it for display seems to fail. When I step into a function around the breakpoint, its data is displayed correctly but when I go up the stack, I am stuck with the \"Collecting data\" timeout again. Despite having the latest version of PyCharm, the problem persists. Is there a general direction I can go to fix or work around this issue?"

        "content": "Debugging issues in PyCharm, especially related to the \"Collecting data\" timeout, can be frustrating. Here are some general directions and potential solutions you can try to resolve or work around the issue:\n\n1. **Update PyCharm**: Although you mentioned using PyCharm Community Edition 2016.2.2, consider updating to the latest version if possible. Newer versions often come with bug fixes and improvements that might resolve such issues.\n\n2. **Increase Timeout Settings**: PyCharm allows you to increase the timeout settings for the debugger. Go to `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Debugger` and try increasing the timeout values.\n\n3. **Reduce Data Complexity**: If possible, simplify the data structures or reduce the size of the data you're working with at the breakpoints. This can sometimes help the debugger process the data more efficiently.\n\n4. **Disable Unnecessary Plugins**: Some plugins might interfere with the debugger. Try disabling any unnecessary or recently installed plugins to see if that resolves the issue.\n\n5. **Check Python Interpreter**: Ensure you are using a compatible Python interpreter in PyCharm. Go to `File > Settings > Project: [Your Project] > Project Interpreter` and verify the interpreter settings.\n\n6. **Invalidate Caches/Restart**: Sometimes, invalidating caches and restarting PyCharm can resolve various issues. Go to `File > Invalidate Caches / Restart` and follow the prompts.\n\n7. **Use Command Line Debugging**: As a workaround, consider using Python's built-in `pdb` module to debug from the command line. This might not be as user-friendly as PyCharm's GUI, but it can help you continue debugging without delays.\n\n8. **Check for Known Issues**: Look for any known issues with your version of PyCharm in their issue tracker or forums. There might be a specific patch or workaround available.\n\n9. **Adjust Debugger Settings**: In `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Debugger`, try tweaking settings such as \"Gevent compatible\" or disabling \"PyQt compatible\" if they are not needed.\n\n10. **Contact Support or Community**: If none of the above solutions work, consider reaching out to JetBrains support or community forums for more targeted assistance.\n\nBy trying these steps, you should be able to identify the cause or find a suitable workaround for the \"Collecting data\" issue in PyCharm."
