I'm using the Anaconda distribution of IPython notebook with Firefox on Mac OS X. Sometimes, I write code with high memory requirements or an infinite loop, and the \"interrupt kernel\" option seems sluggish or unreliable. I've also experienced situations where my scripts cause OS X to run out of memory leading to a hard reboot."

        "content": "If you're finding the \"Interrupt Kernel\" option in Jupyter Notebook (formerly IPython Notebook) to be sluggish or unreliable, especially when dealing with high memory requirements or infinite loops, here are a few approaches you can try to interrupt running cells more effectively:\n\n1. **Kernel Menu**: Use the \"Kernel\" menu at the top and select \"Interrupt Kernel\". This sends a SIGINT signal to the kernel, similar to pressing `CTRL+C` in a terminal. However, as you've noted, this might not always work if the kernel is heavily loaded.\n\n2. **Keyboard Shortcut**: Ensure that you're using the correct shortcut. On a Mac, you can try pressing `Esc` to make sure you're in command mode, and then press `I` twice (`I, I`). This is the shortcut for interrupting the kernel.\n\n3. **Terminal Command**: If the kernel is unresponsive, you can try killing the kernel process directly from the terminal:\n   - Open a terminal and find the Jupyter Notebook process ID (PID) using:\n     ```bash\n     ps aux | grep jupyter\n     ```\n   - Once you've identified the correct PID, you can kill it using:\n     ```bash\n     kill -9 <PID>\n     ```\n   This is a more forceful approach and will terminate the kernel immediately.\n\n4. **Resource Management**: To prevent running out of memory, consider using resource limits:\n   - Use smaller subsets of your data or reduce memory usage by optimizing your code.\n   - Try running memory-intensive parts of your code separately or use Python's memory management tools like `gc.collect()` to free up memory.\n\n5. **Jupyter Extensions**: Consider using Jupyter Notebook extensions that provide additional keyboard shortcuts or functionality for managing the kernel and memory.\n\n6. **System Monitoring**: Keep an eye on your system's resource usage using Activity Monitor on Mac OS X. This can help you identify processes that are using a lot of memory or CPU and allow you to terminate them before they cause a system crash.\n\n7. **Use a Different Browser**: Sometimes, switching to a different browser can help with performance issues. Chrome or Safari might handle the Jupyter interface differently and could provide a more responsive experience.\n\nBy using these methods, you should have more reliable ways to interrupt or manage running cells in your Jupyter Notebook environment."
