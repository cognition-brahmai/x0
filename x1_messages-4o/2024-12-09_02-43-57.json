        "content": "I'm facing an issue where the jobs launched by GridSearchCV in my script seem to hang. The script works fine when I use `n_jobs=1` in `GridSearchCV`, but when I try to run jobs in parallel by setting `n_jobs=-1`, the script just hangs without any significant memory pressure. I've noticed that removing the `TruncatedSVD` step from the feature extraction pipeline allows the script to work with multiple jobs. I'm looking for a solution to this problem, where I can run jobs in parallel without having to remove the `TruncatedSVD` step. The environment specs are MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2010), 2.4 GHz Intel Core i5, 8 GB 1067 MHz DDR3, OSX 10.10.5, python 3.4.3, ipython 3.2.0, numpy v1.9.3, scipy 0.16.0, scikit-learn v0.16.1."

        "content": "It sounds like you're encountering a common issue related to parallel processing and certain steps in the feature extraction pipeline. The problem you're facing might be caused by how `TruncatedSVD` interacts with the parallel processing framework. Here are some suggestions to help you resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check for Conflicts with `TruncatedSVD`:**\n   - `TruncatedSVD` can be memory-intensive, and issues can arise when it's used in a parallel context. Try reducing the number of components or ensuring that your data is appropriately scaled before applying `TruncatedSVD`.\n\n2. **Upgrade Your Libraries:**\n   - Since you're using older versions of Python and libraries, consider upgrading to newer versions. Newer versions of Python, NumPy, SciPy, and scikit-learn often come with performance improvements and bug fixes that might resolve your issue.\n\n3. **Use a Different Backend:**\n   - Scikit-learn's `GridSearchCV` can use different parallel backends. By default, it uses `loky`, but sometimes switching to `threading` or `multiprocessing` might help. You can set this by using the `joblib` library:\n     ```python\n     from sklearn.externals.joblib import parallel_backend\n     with parallel_backend('threading'):\n         grid_search.fit(X, y)\n     ```\n\n4. **Debugging and Logs:**\n   - Enable verbose output in `GridSearchCV` to see where exactly the process hangs:\n     ```python\n     grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator, param_grid, n_jobs=-1, verbose=10)\n     ```\n   - This will give you more insights into which part of the process is causing the issue.\n\n5. **Resource Limits:**\n   - Ensure that your system\u2019s resource limits (like open files or process limits) are not being hit. You can check and adjust these limits using `ulimit` in the terminal.\n\n6. **Reduce `n_jobs`:**\n   - Instead of using `n_jobs=-1`, which uses all available processors, try using a smaller number to see if a specific number of jobs don't hang. For example, `n_jobs=2` or `n_jobs=3`.\n\n7. **Alternative Dimensionality Reduction:**\n   - If `TruncatedSVD` continues to cause issues, consider experimenting with other dimensionality reduction techniques like `PCA` or `NMF` to see if they work better with parallel processing in your environment.\n\n8. **Testing on a Different Machine:**\n   - If possible, test your script on a different machine or environment to verify if the issue is specific to your current setup.\n\nBy trying these suggestions, you should be able to identify and fix the issue with parallel processing in your script."
