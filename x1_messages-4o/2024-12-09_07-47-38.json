However, I can see my venv folder clearly. I'm using Windows 10 with the Git Bash terminal installed. What could be the problem?"

        "content": "To automatically activate a virtual environment in Visual Studio Code while using Git Bash on Windows 10, you need to ensure that the path and command are correctly specified in your settings. The error code 127 usually indicates that the command is not found, which might be due to an incorrect path or syntax. Here's how you can properly configure it:\n\n1. **Verify the Path**: Make sure that the path to your virtual environment's activation script is correct. On Windows, the activation script for Git Bash would typically be located at `${workspaceFolder}/env/Scripts/activate`.\n\n2. **Use the Correct Command**: Git Bash uses a different syntax compared to the default Windows command line. You should use the `source` command to activate the virtual environment.\n\n3. **Configure VS Code**:\n   - Open your settings.json file in VS Code.\n   - Modify the settings to ensure the path is correctly set up for Git Bash.\n\nHere is a sample configuration for `settings.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"terminal.integrated.profiles.windows\": {\n        \"Git Bash\": {\n            \"path\": \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Git\\\\bin\\\\bash.exe\",\n            \"args\": [\"--login\", \"-i\"]\n        }\n    },\n    \"terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.windows\": \"Git Bash\",\n    \"python.defaultInterpreterPath\": \"${workspaceFolder}/env/Scripts/python.exe\",\n    \"python.terminal.activateEnvironment\": true\n}\n```\n\n4. **Add Activation Command in Tasks**: If you want the environment to activate automatically for certain tasks, you can add a pre-launch task in your `tasks.json` file:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\n    \"tasks\": [\n        {\n            \"label\": \"Activate Virtual Environment\",\n            \"type\": \"shell\",\n            \"command\": \"source ${workspaceFolder}/env/Scripts/activate\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n5. **Check Git Bash Path**: Make sure that the path to Git Bash is correctly set in your system PATH or in the VS Code settings if you have a custom installation directory.\n\n6. **Restart VS Code**: Sometimes, a simple restart of Visual Studio Code can solve path-related issues.\n\nBy ensuring these settings and paths are correctly configured, you should be able to automatically activate your virtual environment in VS Code using Git Bash on Windows 10 without encountering the error code 127."
