However, when I add the same URL to my 'requirements.txt' file and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, it seems like the package doesn't get installed.

        "content": "The issue you're encountering may be due to several factors, including how the package is being installed from the URL and how it's listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify Installation:**\n   Ensure that the package is being installed in the correct Python environment. If you're using a virtual environment, make sure it's activated when you're running the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command.\n\n2. **Check Installation Directory:**\n   After running the installation, check the `site-packages` directory of your environment to see if the `bs4` package is present. The directory path typically looks like `path/to/your/env/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages/`.\n\n3. **Correct the URL:**\n   Make sure the URL in `requirements.txt` is correct and accessible. Sometimes, network issues or URL changes can affect the download process.\n\n4. **Update `requirements.txt` Syntax:**\n   Use the `#egg` syntax to specify the package name in `requirements.txt`. This can help pip recognize the correct package name. Modify the line in `requirements.txt` as follows:\n\n   ```\n   http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/unreleased/4.x/BeautifulSoup-4.0b.tar.gz#egg=beautifulsoup4\n   ```\n\n5. **Check for Errors During Installation:**\n   Look for any error messages that might be displayed during the installation process. These can provide clues about what might be going wrong.\n\n6. **Install Manually:**\n   As a workaround, you can manually download the tar.gz file, extract it, and run `python setup.py install` in the extracted directory to ensure it's installed properly.\n\n7. **Install from PyPI:**\n   If possible, consider installing the package from the Python Package Index (PyPI) using:\n\n   ```\n   pip install beautifulsoup4\n   ```\n\n   This is often more reliable than direct URL installations.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully import the `bs4` module in your Python environment."
