Assuming the column for the date of birth is named `date_of_birth`, here is how you can write the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM Customers\nWHERE date_of_birth = '1996-07-15';\n```\n\nNote that the date format used here is `YYYY-MM-DD`, which is the standard format for SQL databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server. You might need to adjust the format depending on the specifics of your database setup. If your database uses a different date format, ensure to use the appropriate format that matches your system."
