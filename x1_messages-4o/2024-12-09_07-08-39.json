I want the output in the following format:\n\n```\nexample two null, - Line number : 2\nexample four null, - Line number : 4\nTotal null count : 2\n```\n\nI know the `-c` option returns the total matched lines, but I'm unsure of how to correctly format it to prepend \"total null count\" and how to append the line numbers."

        "content": "You can achieve the desired output by using a combination of `grep`, `awk`, and `wc` (word count). Here's a step-by-step approach to get the output in the format you want:\n\n1. Use `grep` with the `-n` option to get the line numbers.\n2. Pipe the output to `awk` to format it as needed.\n3. Use `grep -c` to count the number of matches and format it accordingly.\n\nHere's the complete command:\n\n```bash\ngrep -in 'null' myfile.txt | awk -F: '{print $2 \" - Line number : \" $1}'\necho \"Total null count : $(grep -ic 'null' myfile.txt)\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- `grep -in 'null' myfile.txt`: This command searches for the string \"null\" in a case-insensitive manner (`-i`) and includes line numbers in the output (`-n`). The output will look like `2:example two null,` for each matching line.\n\n- `awk -F: '{print $2 \" - Line number : \" $1}'`: This processes each line from the `grep` output. It uses `:` as the field separator (`-F:`) and formats the output to display the line content first (`$2`) followed by the line number (`$1`).\n\n- `grep -ic 'null' myfile.txt`: This counts the number of lines containing the string \"null\" in a case-insensitive manner and formats it with \"Total null count :\".\n\nBy running these commands, you'll get the output in the desired format, showing each matching line with its line number and the total count of matches."
