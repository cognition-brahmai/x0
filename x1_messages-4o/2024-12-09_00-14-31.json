Currently, I have the following code, but I am unable to figure out how to get the index of the character. Can someone guide me on how to obtain the current index of the character in the loop?\n\n```python\nloopme = 'THIS IS A VERY LONG STRING WITH MANY MANY WORDS!'\n\nfor w in loopme:\n    print \"CURRENT WORD IS \" + w + \" AT CHARACTER \"\n```"

        "content": "To print both the current character and its index in a string using a for loop in Python, you can use the `enumerate()` function. This function provides both the index and the character as you iterate over the string. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nloopme = 'THIS IS A VERY LONG STRING WITH MANY MANY WORDS!'\n\nfor index, w in enumerate(loopme):\n    print(\"CURRENT WORD IS \" + w + \" AT CHARACTER \" + str(index))\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- `enumerate(loopme)` provides a tuple containing the index and the character for each iteration.\n- `index` is the position of the character in the string.\n- `w` is the character itself.\n- `str(index)` is used to convert the index to a string so it can be concatenated with the other strings in the `print()` function. \n\nThis will produce the desired output with each character and its corresponding index."
