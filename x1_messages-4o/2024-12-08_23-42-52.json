One of the tribespeople has pointed out three stones in a row on the ground, claiming that it's a secret code to unlock a treasure. However, this code is not so easy to decipher. The stones can either be red or blue, with the first stone positioned to the left of the second, and the second stone to the left of the third. The tribesperson gives you two clues to help you crack the code. If the first stone is red, then the third stone is not red. Furthermore, if the second stone is blue, then the first stone is red. Your task is to figure out the code using multiple-step reasoning. Can you unlock the treasure?"
