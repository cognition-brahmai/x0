I need to find all departments that do not have any volunteers assigned to them. Currently, I am using a raw SQL query to achieve this. I'm using a LEFT JOIN between vsp_department and vsp_departmentvolunteer on the department_id, and then selecting where the department_id is NULL in the vsp_departmentvolunteer table. Is there a more Django-like way of doing this or should I just stick with raw SQL?\n\nHere are my models for reference:\n```python\nclass Volunteer(models.Model):\n    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50L)\n    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=50L)    \n    email = models.CharField(max_length=50L)\n    gender = models.CharField(max_length=1, choices=GENDER_CHOICES)\n\n\nclass Department(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=50L, unique=True)\n    overseer = models.ForeignKey(Volunteer, blank=True, null=True)\n    location = models.CharField(max_length=100L, null=True)\n\n\nclass DepartmentVolunteer(models.Model):\n    volunteer = models.ForeignKey(Volunteer)\n    department = models.ForeignKey(Department)\n    assistant = models.BooleanField(default=False)\n    keyman = models.BooleanField(default=False)\n    captain = models.BooleanField(default=False)\n    location = models.CharField(max_length=100L, blank=True, null=True)\n```\nAnd this is the SQL query I am currently using:\n```sql\nSELECT \n    d.name \nFROM   \n    vsp_department AS d\nLEFT JOIN vsp_departmentvolunteer AS dv\nON d.id = dv.department_id  \nWHERE\n    dv.department_id IS NULL;\n```"

        "content": "You can achieve this in a more Django-like way by using the Django ORM's `annotate` and `filter` methods. The key here is to use `annotate` to count the number of volunteers in each department and then filter those departments where the count is zero. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db.models import Count\n\n# Query to find departments with no volunteers assigned to them\ndepartments_without_volunteers = Department.objects.annotate(\n    volunteer_count=Count('departmentvolunteer')\n).filter(volunteer_count=0)\n```\n\nThis query uses `annotate` to add a `volunteer_count` field to each `Department` object, which counts the number of related `DepartmentVolunteer` records. Then, it filters the departments where `volunteer_count` is zero, meaning there are no volunteers assigned to them. This approach is more efficient and leverages the Django ORM's capabilities, making your code cleaner and more maintainable."
