        "content": "To execute an SQL query using C++ to retrieve the teaching history of Alexander, we can use a library like SQLite or MySQL Connector/C++. Below, I'll provide an example using SQLite for simplicity. This example assumes that you have the SQLite library installed and set up in your development environment.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <sqlite3.h>\n\nint main() {\n    sqlite3* db;\n    char* errMsg = nullptr;\n    int rc;\n\n    // Open database\n    rc = sqlite3_open(\"school.db\", &db);\n    \n    if (rc) {\n        std::cerr << \"Can't open database: \" << sqlite3_errmsg(db) << std::endl;\n        return 1;\n    } else {\n        std::cout << \"Opened database successfully.\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    const char* sql = R\"(\n        SELECT s.name, th.teaching_date\n        FROM teachers t\n        JOIN teaching_history th ON t.id = th.teacher_id\n        JOIN subjects s ON th.subject_id = s.id\n        WHERE t.name = 'Alexander';\n    )\";\n\n    auto callback = [](void* NotUsed, int argc, char** argv, char** azColName) {\n        for (int i = 0; i < argc; i++) {\n            std::cout << azColName[i] << \": \" << (argv[i] ? argv[i] : \"NULL\") << std::endl;\n        }\n        std::cout << std::endl;\n        return 0;\n    };\n\n    // Execute the SQL query\n    rc = sqlite3_exec(db, sql, callback, 0, &errMsg);\n    \n    if (rc != SQLITE_OK) {\n        std::cerr << \"SQL error: \" << errMsg << std::endl;\n        sqlite3_free(errMsg);\n    } else {\n        std::cout << \"Query executed successfully.\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    // Close database\n    sqlite3_close(db);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Database Connection**: Open a connection to the SQLite database named `school.db`.\n\n2. **SQL Query**: The SQL query selects the subject names and teaching dates from the `teaching_history` table, joining with the `teachers` and `subjects` tables to get the relevant information for the teacher named 'Alexander'.\n\n3. **Callback Function**: This function is called for each row in the result set. It prints out the column names and values.\n\n4. **Execute Query**: `sqlite3_exec` is used to execute the SQL query. The results are processed by the callback function.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: If there's an error in executing the query, it is printed out.\n\n6. **Close Database**: Finally, the database connection is closed.\n\nNote: Make sure to replace `\"school.db\"` with the actual path to your SQLite database file. If you're using a different database system like MySQL, you would need to include the appropriate headers and use their specific API for C++."
