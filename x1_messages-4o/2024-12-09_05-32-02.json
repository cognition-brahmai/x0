From my understanding of an interpreter, it reads program expressions as strings and then converts those strings into code. So, would it be a wasted time every time it parses a comment? Is there any specific convention for comments in interpreted languages, or is the impact negligible?"

        "content": "Leaving comments in your code does not slow down the interpreter in interpreted languages like Python, Ruby, PHP, or JavaScript. Interpreters are designed to ignore comments entirely during execution. Comments are removed during the lexical analysis or parsing phase before actual interpretation or execution of the code begins. As a result, they do not impact the runtime performance of your program. \n\nThe process of ignoring comments is efficient, and the time spent parsing comments is negligible compared to the actual execution time of the code. Therefore, the presence of comments in your code does not lead to any noticeable performance drawbacks.\n\nRegarding conventions for comments, each language has its own syntax for writing comments:\n\n- **Python**: Use `#` for single-line comments and `\"\"\"` or `'''` for multi-line comments (docstrings).\n- **Ruby**: Use `#` for single-line comments and `=begin` and `=end` for multi-line comments.\n- **PHP**: Use `//` or `#` for single-line comments and `/* ... */` for multi-line comments.\n- **JavaScript**: Use `//` for single-line comments and `/* ... */` for multi-line comments.\n\nThe impact of comments is negligible, so it's a good practice to use them to improve code readability and maintainability without worrying about performance issues."
