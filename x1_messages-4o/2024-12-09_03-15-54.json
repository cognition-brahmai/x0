However, I would like to perform some calculations on these values but the square brackets are preventing me from doing so. How can I remove the brackets? I've seen some examples but I'm unable to apply them to this case."

        "content": "The output you have is a list of lists, where each inner list contains a single float value. If you want to perform calculations on these values, you can first flatten the list of lists into a single list. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Your original list of lists\ndata = [[180.0], [173.8], [164.2], [156.5], [147.2], [138.2]]\n\n# Flatten the list of lists into a single list\nflattened_data = [item[0] for item in data]\n\n# Now you can perform calculations on flattened_data\n# For example, calculate the sum of the values\ntotal_sum = sum(flattened_data)\n\n# Print the flattened data and the sum\nprint(\"Flattened Data:\", flattened_data)\nprint(\"Sum of Values:\", total_sum)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **List Comprehension**: `[item[0] for item in data]` iterates over each inner list in `data` and extracts the first (and only) element, resulting in a new list of these float values.\n- **Flattened Data**: `flattened_data` is now a simple list of float values without any inner lists, so you can easily perform calculations like sum, average, etc.\n\nFeel free to adjust the calculations according to your needs!"
