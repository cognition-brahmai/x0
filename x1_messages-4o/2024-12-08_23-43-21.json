        "content": "Certainly! Let's break this down step by step.\n\n### Part 1: Parts of Speech Tagging with Penn Treebank Tagset\n\nHere is the sentence with parts of speech labeled:\n\n1. **A** - DT (Determiner)\n2. **lawyer** - NN (Noun, singular or mass)\n3. **,** - , (Comma)\n4. **who** - WP (Wh-pronoun)\n5. **had** - VBD (Verb, past tense)\n6. **just** - RB (Adverb)\n7. **won** - VBN (Verb, past participle)\n8. **a** - DT (Determiner)\n9. **high-profile** - JJ (Adjective)\n10. **case** - NN (Noun, singular or mass)\n11. **in** - IN (Preposition or subordinating conjunction)\n12. **the** - DT (Determiner)\n13. **Supreme** - NNP (Proper noun, singular)\n14. **Court** - NNP (Proper noun, singular)\n15. **of** - IN (Preposition or subordinating conjunction)\n16. **the** - DT (Determiner)\n17. **United** - NNP (Proper noun, singular)\n18. **States** - NNP (Proper noun, singular)\n19. **,** - , (Comma)\n20. **was** - VBD (Verb, past tense)\n21. **buying** - VBG (Verb, gerund or present participle)\n22. **some** - DT (Determiner)\n23. **books** - NNS (Noun, plural)\n24. **at** - IN (Preposition or subordinating conjunction)\n25. **the** - DT (Determiner)\n26. **renowned** - JJ (Adjective)\n27. **Strand** - NNP (Proper noun, singular)\n28. **Bookstore** - NNP (Proper noun, singular)\n29. **in** - IN (Preposition or subordinating conjunction)\n30. **New** - NNP (Proper noun, singular)\n31. **York** - NNP (Proper noun, singular)\n32. **City** - NNP (Proper noun, singular)\n33. **,** - , (Comma)\n34. **which** - WDT (Wh-determiner)\n35. **has** - VBZ (Verb, 3rd person singular present)\n36. **been** - VBN (Verb, past participle)\n37. **in** - IN (Preposition or subordinating conjunction)\n38. **business** - NN (Noun, singular or mass)\n39. **since** - IN (Preposition or subordinating conjunction)\n40. **1927** - CD (Cardinal number)\n41. **and** - CC (Coordinating conjunction)\n42. **is** - VBZ (Verb, 3rd person singular present)\n43. **famous** - JJ (Adjective)\n44. **for** - IN (Preposition or subordinating conjunction)\n45. **its** - PRP$ (Possessive pronoun)\n46. **extensive** - JJ (Adjective)\n47. **collection** - NN (Noun, singular or mass)\n48. **of** - IN (Preposition or subordinating conjunction)\n49. **rare** - JJ (Adjective)\n50. **and** - CC (Coordinating conjunction)\n51. **out-of-print** - JJ (Adjective)\n52. **books** - NNS (Noun, plural)\n53. **.** - . (Period)\n\n### Part 2: Frequency Table\n\n| Part of Speech | Frequency |\n|----------------|-----------|\n| DT             | 5         |\n| NN             | 5         |\n| ,              | 3         |\n| WP             | 1         |\n| VBD            | 2         |\n| RB             | 1         |\n| VBN            | 2         |\n| JJ             | 5         |\n| IN             | 7         |\n| NNP            | 10        |\n| VBG            | 1         |\n| NNS            | 2         |\n| WDT            | 1         |\n| VBZ            | 2         |\n| CD             | 1         |\n| CC             | 2         |\n| PRP$           | 1         |\n| .              | 1         |\n\n### Part 3: SQL Query\n\nTo retrieve the top three most frequently used parts of speech, the SQL query would look like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT part_of_speech, COUNT(part_of_speech) AS frequency\nFROM pos_table\nGROUP BY part_of_speech\nORDER BY frequency DESC\nLIMIT 3;\n```\n\n### Part 4: Syntactic and Semantic Roles\n\n1. **Determiners (DT):** These specify nouns and help to define the reference of the noun. For example, \"A lawyer\" introduces a non-specific individual, while \"the Supreme Court\" specifies a well-known entity.\n\n2. **Nouns (NN, NNS, NNP):** Serve as subjects, objects, or complements. \"Lawyer\" is the subject, \"case\" is the object of \"won,\" and \"books\" are the objects of \"buying.\"\n\n3. **Commas (,):** Used to separate clauses and elements within the sentence, helping to clarify meaning.\n\n4. **Wh-pronouns (WP, WDT):** Introduce relative clauses, adding additional information about the noun. \"Who\" introduces a clause providing more detail on the lawyer.\n\n5. **Verbs (VBD, VBN, VBG, VBZ):** Indicate actions or states. \"Won\" and \"was buying\" are actions, \"is\" and \"has been\" denote states of being.\n\n6. **Adverbs (RB):** Modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. \"Just\" modifies \"won\" to indicate recentness.\n\n7. **Adjectives (JJ):** Describe or modify nouns. \"High-profile\" and \"extensive\" give more information about \"case\" and \"collection.\"\n\n8. **Prepositions (IN):** Show relationships between elements in the sentence. \"In\" and \"of\" link nouns to other sentence components.\n\n9. **Conjunctions (CC):** Connect clauses or phrases. \"And\" links \"has been in business\" with \"is famous for.\"\n\n10. **Cardinal numbers (CD):** Specify quantities or order. \"1927\" indicates a point in time.\n\n11. **Possessive pronouns (PRP$):** Indicate possession. \"Its\" specifies ownership of the \"collection.\"\n\n### Subcategorization Frames and Argument Structures\n\n- **Verbs like \"won\"** typically take a subject and a direct object.\n- **\"Was buying\"** implies an ongoing action and takes a direct object.\n- **\"Is famous for\"** involves a subject and a prepositional phrase indicating the cause of fame.\n\nEach part of speech contributes to the syntactic structure and helps convey the semantic meaning of the sentence. Together, they form a complex structure that provides detailed information about the actions and states being described."
