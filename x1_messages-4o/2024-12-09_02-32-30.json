I have trained my network and generated some training/validation losses which I saved with the following code:\n\n```python\nvalid_summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(\"/path/to/logs/\")\nwith train_summary_writer.as_default():\n    tf.summary.scalar('Training Loss', data=epoch_loss, step=current_step)\n```\n\nI would like to view the loss curves using Tensorboard after training. However, because I saved the loss curves under the names 'Training Loss' and 'Validation Loss', these curves are plotted on separate graphs. I am aware that I should change the name to 'loss' to solve this problem for future writes to the log directory, but how can I edit my existing log files for the training/validation losses to account for this? I tried modifying a solution that edits the steps of a log file and re-writes the file, but had no success. Is there a way to do this, possibly in Tensorflow 2.X?"

        "content": "To edit existing TensorBoard logs, you need to read the events, modify them, and then write them back. TensorBoard logs are stored in a binary format called TensorFlow Event files, which are not straightforward to modify directly. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Read the current events**: Use `tf.data.TFRecordDataset` to read the existing event logs.\n\n2. **Modify the event names**: Change the tag names from 'Training Loss' and 'Validation Loss' to 'loss' or any other desired common name.\n\n3. **Write modified events**: Use `tf.summary.create_file_writer` to write the modified events back to a new log directory.\n\nHere's an example code snippet demonstrating these steps:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport os\n\ndef modify_event_log(input_log_dir, output_log_dir, old_tags, new_tag):\n    # Make sure the output directory exists\n    os.makedirs(output_log_dir, exist_ok=True)\n\n    # Summary writer for the new log\n    summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(output_log_dir)\n    \n    # Process each event file in the input log directory\n    for event_file in os.listdir(input_log_dir):\n        input_filepath = os.path.join(input_log_dir, event_file)\n\n        # Read the event file\n        for serialized_example in tf.data.TFRecordDataset([input_filepath]):\n            event = tf.compat.v1.Event.FromString(serialized_example.numpy())\n\n            # Write each summary with the modified tag\n            for value in event.summary.value:\n                if value.tag in old_tags:\n                    with summary_writer.as_default():\n                        tf.summary.scalar(new_tag, value.simple_value, step=event.step)\n\n    summary_writer.close()\n\n# Usage\ninput_log_dir = \"/path/to/original/logs\"\noutput_log_dir = \"/path/to/modified/logs\"\nold_tags = ['Training Loss', 'Validation Loss']\nnew_tag = 'loss'\n\nmodify_event_log(input_log_dir, output_log_dir, old_tags, new_tag)\n```\n\n### Important Points:\n\n- **Backup Your Data**: Always create a backup of your original log files before attempting any modifications.\n  \n- **New Directory**: It's a good practice to write modified logs to a new directory to avoid overwriting original data.\n\n- **Check TensorBoard**: After modifications, use TensorBoard to verify the results.\n\n- **TensorFlow Version**: Ensure your TensorFlow version is compatible with the above methods as API changes might affect functionality.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to modify your existing logs so that the training and validation loss appear on the same graph in TensorBoard."
