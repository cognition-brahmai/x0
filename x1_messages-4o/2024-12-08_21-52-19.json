Use metaphor and personification to describe the ingredients and the cooking process. Include nonsensical phrases and word pairings to create a dreamlike atmosphere. \nExample recipe:\nTake a handful of moonbeams \nAnd mix them with a splash of starlight\nLet them dance in a cauldron of dreams \nUntil they turn into a fluffy delight\nSprinkle some unicorn tears for taste \nAnd watch the flavors transcend space\nServe on a bed of rainbow clouds \nAnd savor the magic that abounds"
