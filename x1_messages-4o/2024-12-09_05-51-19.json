        "content": "The issue with your code lies in the way you're trying to filter the `pub_date`. In a Django `QuerySet`, you should use the `__gte` (greater than or equal to) lookup to filter for dates within a certain range. Additionally, you should use `datetime.timedelta` to subtract days from the current date. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport datetime\nfrom django.utils import timezone\n\n# Assuming `member` is an instance of the model that has a `user` attribute, and xyz_id is the specific value you're interested in.\none_week_ago = timezone.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=7)\n\nposts = Post.objects.filter(\n    author=member.user,\n    xyz=xyz_id,\n    pub_date__gte=one_week_ago\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`timezone.now()`**: This is used instead of `datetime.datetime.now()` to ensure that your code is timezone aware. This is generally recommended in Django applications.\n- **`datetime.timedelta(days=7)`**: This calculates the difference of 7 days from the current date and time.\n- **`pub_date__gte=one_week_ago`**: This uses the `__gte` lookup to filter posts published on or after `one_week_ago`.\n\nMake sure that:\n- The `pub_date` field in your `Post` model is a `DateTimeField`.\n- `member` is correctly assigned and has the `user` attribute.\n- `xyz_id` is the correct value you're filtering against.\n\nThis should give you all posts by the specified author with the specified `xyz` value from the last 7 days."
