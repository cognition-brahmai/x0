I am facing a problem where when a coroutine raises an exception, the entire program doesn't fail with that exception. Also, asyncio does not print error messages from coroutines unless I use logging level \"DEBUG\". How can I make the program to fail with the exception if a coroutine raises it? Below is the code that I am currently working with:\n\n```python\nfrom asyncio import get_event_loop, sleep\n\nasync def c(sleep_time=2, fail=False):\n    print('c', sleep_time, fail)\n    if fail:\n        raise Exception('fail')\n    while True:\n        print('doing stuff')\n        await sleep(sleep_time)\n\nloop = get_event_loop()\nloop.create_task(c(sleep_time=10, fail=False))\nloop.create_task(c(fail=True))\nloop.run_forever()\n```"

        "content": "In your current setup, when a coroutine raises an exception, it does not affect other coroutines or the main event loop. The `loop.run_forever()` will continue to run even if one of the coroutines raises an exception. To handle exceptions in coroutines and make the main program fail when any coroutine fails, you can do the following:\n\n1. Use `asyncio.gather` to group your coroutines and specify `return_exceptions=False` to make the program stop if any coroutine raises an exception.\n2. Wrap your main logic in a `try-except` block to catch and handle exceptions.\n3. Use `add_done_callback` to handle exceptions from individual tasks if you're not using `gather`.\n\nHere's a modified version of your code using `asyncio.gather`:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def c(sleep_time=2, fail=False):\n    print('c', sleep_time, fail)\n    if fail:\n        raise Exception('fail')\n    while True:\n        print('doing stuff')\n        await asyncio.sleep(sleep_time)\n\nasync def main():\n    try:\n        # Using asyncio.gather to run coroutines and catch exceptions\n        await asyncio.gather(\n            c(sleep_time=10, fail=False),\n            c(fail=True),\n            return_exceptions=False\n        )\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error occurred: {e}\")\n        # Optionally, re-raise the exception to exit the program\n        raise\n\n# Run the main function\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nIn this setup, if any of the coroutines raise an exception, it will be caught by the `try-except` block in the `main()` function, and the program will stop running. This method ensures that your program fails with an exception as soon as any coroutine fails."
