        "content": "The \"Broken pipe\" error you're encountering usually indicates that the client closed the connection before the server finished sending a response. This can happen for a variety of reasons, especially under high load or when handling many concurrent requests. Here are some potential causes and solutions to consider:\n\n1. **Client Timeout**: If clients are timing out before receiving a response, they might close the connection, causing a broken pipe. Ensure your application is responding quickly enough, or increase client-side timeout settings.\n\n2. **Keep-Alive Settings**: If the keep-alive settings are not properly configured, connections might be closed prematurely. Check your web server and uWSGI keep-alive settings.\n\n3. **uWSGI Buffer Limit**: The buffer size for requests/responses might be inadequate for the data being sent. Try increasing the buffer size by setting `buffer-size` in your uWSGI configuration.\n\n4. **Concurrency Limits**: uWSGI might not be configured to handle the level of concurrency you're testing. Ensure you have enough worker processes/threads set up. Consider increasing the number of workers with the `--workers` option or using gevent more effectively.\n\n5. **Network Configuration**: Verify that your network configuration can handle the number of concurrent connections. Check the TCP backlog (`net.core.somaxconn`) and increase it if necessary.\n\n6. **Resource Limits**: Ensure that your system\u2019s resource limits (like file descriptors) are high enough to handle the number of concurrent connections. You might need to increase the limits using `ulimit`.\n\n7. **Django Version**: Django 1.4 is quite old and might have performance limitations or bugs not present in newer versions. Consider upgrading to a more recent version of Django if possible.\n\n8. **Logging and Monitoring**: Use logging and monitoring tools to gain more insight into what happens during these high-load scenarios. This can help pinpoint where the bottleneck or failure is occurring.\n\nIf these steps do not resolve the issue, you may need to perform a more detailed analysis of both server and application logs, and potentially use profiling tools to diagnose performance bottlenecks in your Django application."
