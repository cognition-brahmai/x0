When I remove the \"queryset\" and leave only \"get_queryset\", I receive the following error: 'AssertionError: base_name argument not specified, and could not automatically determine the name from the viewset, as it does not have a .queryset attribute.' Here is the code I'm working with:\n\n```python\nclass MyModelView(viewsets.ModelViewSet):\n\n    permissions_classes = (permissions.IsAuthenticated,)\n    serializer_class = MyModelleSerializer\n\n    def get_queryset(self, username=None):\n        if username is not None:\n            user = UserModel.objects.get(username=username)\n            queryset = MyModel.filter(author=user)\n            return queryset\n        else:\n            queryset = MyModel.objects.all()\n            return queryset\n\n    lookup_field = 'username'\n    lookup_value_regex = '[a-zA-Z0-9$&(._)\\-]+'\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that Django is unable to determine the `base_name` for the viewset because it relies on the `queryset` attribute to do so. When you override `get_queryset`, you should still provide a default `queryset` attribute, even if it's just a placeholder. This helps Django determine the `base_name` when it's needed, such as when generating URLs.\n\nHere is how you can adjust your code:\n\n```python\nclass MyModelView(viewsets.ModelViewSet):\n    permission_classes = (permissions.IsAuthenticated,)\n    serializer_class = MyModelleSerializer\n\n    # Provide a default queryset\n    queryset = MyModel.objects.none()  # Use none() if you don't want to expose any data as default\n\n    def get_queryset(self):\n        username = self.kwargs.get('username')  # Get 'username' from URL kwargs\n        if username is not None:\n            try:\n                user = UserModel.objects.get(username=username)\n                queryset = MyModel.objects.filter(author=user)\n            except UserModel.DoesNotExist:\n                queryset = MyModel.objects.none()  # Return an empty queryset if user not found\n        else:\n            queryset = MyModel.objects.all()\n        \n        return queryset\n\n    lookup_field = 'username'\n    lookup_value_regex = '[a-zA-Z0-9$&(._)\\-]+'\n```\n\n### Key Adjustments:\n\n1. **Default Queryset**: Set `queryset = MyModel.objects.none()`, which makes sure there's a default queryset. This is necessary for Django's internal operations, such as URL routing.\n\n2. **URL Parameters**: Use `self.kwargs.get('username')` to retrieve the `username` parameter from the URL. This ensures that the method works correctly with the routing system.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Add a `try-except` block around the retrieval of the `UserModel` instance to handle cases where the username does not exist, which would prevent potential errors in your application.\n\nBy making these adjustments, you should be able to override the `get_queryset` method successfully, avoiding the `AssertionError` while maintaining the ability to filter by the username."
