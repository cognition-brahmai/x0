However, when I try to use psycopg2, I encounter the following error: `Reason: Incompatible library version: _psycopg.so requires version 1.0.0 or later, but libssl.0.9.8.dylib provides version 0.9.8`. Using `pip freeze`, I can see `psycopg2==2.4.5` as expected. I've installed psycopg2 on several virtual environments and this is the first time I'm seeing such an error. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but the issue persists. Can you provide guidance on how to resolve this?"

        "content": "It looks like you're encountering a compatibility issue with the OpenSSL library (`libssl`) on your Mac system. This kind of problem often arises because `psycopg2` is trying to use a different version of the SSL library than the one available on your system. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Upgrade OpenSSL:**\n   - You can try upgrading OpenSSL using Homebrew, which is a package manager for macOS:\n     ```bash\n     brew update\n     brew upgrade openssl\n     ```\n\n2. **Re-link OpenSSL:**\n   - Ensure that your system is using the latest version of OpenSSL:\n     ```bash\n     brew link openssl --force\n     ```\n\n3. **Set Environment Variables:**\n   - Before installing `psycopg2`, you can set environment variables to ensure it uses the correct OpenSSL libraries:\n     ```bash\n     export LDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib\"\n     export CPPFLAGS=\"-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include\"\n     ```\n\n4. **Reinstall psycopg2:**\n   - Uninstall and then reinstall `psycopg2`, ensuring that it uses the updated OpenSSL:\n     ```bash\n     pip uninstall psycopg2\n     pip install psycopg2\n     ```\n\n5. **Use psycopg2-binary:**\n   - As an alternative, you can try using `psycopg2-binary`, which is a standalone package that does not require compilation:\n     ```bash\n     pip uninstall psycopg2\n     pip install psycopg2-binary\n     ```\n\n6. **Virtual Environment Re-creation:**\n   - If you're using a virtual environment, you might want to recreate it to ensure there are no residual issues:\n     ```bash\n     deactivate\n     rm -rf your-virtual-env\n     python3 -m venv your-virtual-env\n     source your-virtual-env/bin/activate\n     pip install psycopg2\n     ```\n\n7. **Check for System Updates:**\n   - Ensure your macOS is up to date, as there could be updates that resolve compatibility issues.\n\nAfter trying these steps, the issue should hopefully be resolved. If it persists, double-check the OpenSSL version used within your Python environment and ensure it matches the system's version."
