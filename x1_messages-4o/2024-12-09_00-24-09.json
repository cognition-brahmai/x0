        "content": "How can I get the dimensions (shape) of a TensorFlow tensor as integer values? I have a 2-D tensor and I need to get the number of rows and columns as int32 so that I can call reshape() to create a tensor of shape (num_rows * num_cols, 1). When I try to use the method tensor.get_shape(), it returns values as Dimension type, not int32. Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\n\nsess = tf.Session()    \ntensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(np.array([[1001,1002,1003],[3,4,5]]), dtype=tf.float32)\n\nsess.run(tensor)    \n# array([[ 1001.,  1002.,  1003.],\n#        [    3.,     4.,     5.]], dtype=float32)\n\ntensor_shape = tensor.get_shape()    \ntensor_shape\n# TensorShape([Dimension(2), Dimension(3)])    \nprint tensor_shape    \n# (2, 3)\n\nnum_rows = tensor_shape[0] # ???\nnum_cols = tensor_shape[1] # ???\n\ntensor2 = tf.reshape(tensor, (num_rows*num_cols, 1))    \n# This results in the following TypeError:\n# TypeError: Expected int32, got Dimension(6) of type 'Dimension' instead.\n```\n\nHow can I solve this issue?"

        "content": "To get the dimensions of a TensorFlow tensor as integer values, you can use the `tf.shape()` function, which returns a tensor containing the shape of another tensor. Here\u2019s how you can modify your code to achieve what you want:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create a session\nsess = tf.Session()\n\n# Convert the numpy array to a tensor\ntensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(np.array([[1001, 1002, 1003], [3, 4, 5]]), dtype=tf.float32)\n\n# Get the shape of the tensor as a tensor of integers\ntensor_shape = tf.shape(tensor)\n\n# Extract the number of rows and columns from the shape tensor\nnum_rows = tensor_shape[0]\nnum_cols = tensor_shape[1]\n\n# Reshape the original tensor\ntensor2 = tf.reshape(tensor, (num_rows * num_cols, 1))\n\n# Run the session to get the result of the reshaped tensor\nresult = sess.run(tensor2)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the code:\n- `tf.shape(tensor)` returns a tensor containing the shape of `tensor`.\n- `num_rows` and `num_cols` are obtained as elements of this shape tensor.\n- When reshaping, ensure the shape dimensions are tensors or integers, not `Dimension` objects. \n\nWhen you run the above code, `result` will contain the reshaped tensor with the desired shape, and you should not encounter a `TypeError`."
