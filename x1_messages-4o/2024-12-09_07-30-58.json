How can I solve this?\n\n```python\nimport pickle as pkl\nimport numpy as np\n\narrayInput = np.zeros((1000,2)) #Trial input\nsave = True\nload = True\n\nfilename = path + 'CNN_Input'\nfileObject = open(fileName, 'wb')\n\nif save:\n    pkl.dump(arrayInput, fileObject)\n    fileObject.close()\n\nif load:\n    fileObject2 = open(fileName, 'wb')\n    modelInput = pkl.load(fileObject2)\n    fileObject2.close()\n\nif arrayInput == modelInput:\n    Print(True)\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is due to the way you're opening the file when attempting to load the pickled data. When you want to load data using `pickle`, you should open the file in read-binary mode (`'rb'`), not write-binary mode (`'wb'`). Here's how you can correct your code:\n\n```python\nimport pickle as pkl\nimport numpy as np\n\narrayInput = np.zeros((1000,2)) # Trial input\nsave = True\nload = True\n\nfilename = 'CNN_Input.pkl'  # Ensure the filename is correct and has a proper extension\npath = \"\"  # Make sure the path is defined if you are using it\n\n# Saving the array\nif save:\n    with open(filename, 'wb') as fileObject:\n        pkl.dump(arrayInput, fileObject)\n\n# Loading the array\nif load:\n    with open(filename, 'rb') as fileObject2:\n        modelInput = pkl.load(fileObject2)\n\n# Check if the arrays are equal\nif np.array_equal(arrayInput, modelInput):\n    print(True)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **File Open Mode**: Open the file in `'rb'` mode when loading data with `pickle.load()`.\n2. **Using `with` Statement**: This ensures that the file is properly closed after reading or writing, which is a good practice.\n3. **Filename Correction**: Ensure the filename is consistent and correctly named.\n4. **Numpy Array Comparison**: Use `np.array_equal()` to compare arrays.\n\nBy making these changes, your code should work correctly without the errors you're encountering."
