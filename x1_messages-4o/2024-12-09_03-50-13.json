I've been unable to find online how to both create a new column and convert another one. Could anyone provide assistance with this?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this using the Pandas library in Python. To create a new column in your DataFrame where each entry is the 'Time' column converted into seconds, you can use the `.dt.total_seconds()` method. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame with a 'Time' column in timedelta format\ndata = {'Time': [pd.Timedelta(days=1, hours=2), pd.Timedelta(hours=5, minutes=30), pd.Timedelta(minutes=45)]}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Create a new column 'Time_in_seconds' with the total seconds from the 'Time' column\ndf['Time_in_seconds'] = df['Time'].dt.total_seconds()\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThis code will create a new column named 'Time_in_seconds' in your DataFrame, where each value is the total number of seconds corresponding to the `timedelta` values in the 'Time' column."
