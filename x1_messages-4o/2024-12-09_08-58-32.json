The current implementation uses Python's built-in `sum()` function along with `range()`, which is efficient in terms of space complexity since `range()` in Python 3 returns a range object that generates numbers on demand and does not store them in memory. However, if you're looking for an alternative approach that explicitly minimizes space usage even further, you can use a simple mathematical formula to calculate the sum of numbers from 0 to \\( n-1 \\) (since your range ends at \\( n \\)):\n\nThe sum of the first \\( m \\) natural numbers is given by the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Sum} = \\frac{m \\times (m + 1)}{2} \\]\n\nFor your specific case, since you want the sum from 0 to \\( n-1 \\), you can adjust \\( m \\) to \\( n-1 \\) in the formula:\n\n```python\nn = 10\nresult = (n - 1) * n // 2\n```\n\nThis approach has a space complexity of \\( O(1) \\) because it only uses a constant amount of space for the calculation, regardless of the size of \\( n \\). Additionally, it has a time complexity of \\( O(1) \\) as it performs a constant number of operations."
