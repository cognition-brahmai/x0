The code snippet is as follows:\n\n```python\nlambda: print \"x\"\n```\n\nI thought that this is a single statement, but it seems to not work as expected. The documentation on what is allowed in a lambda function seems a little sparse. Can someone explain this to me?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with the lambda function is due to the syntax and limitations of Python's lambda expressions. In Python, a lambda function is designed to create anonymous functions that are limited to a single expression. However, there are specific restrictions on what constitutes a valid expression within a lambda.\n\nIn your example:\n\n```python\nlambda: print \"x\"\n```\n\nThe problem arises because `print` is not a function in Python 2; it is a statement. In Python 2, you cannot use statements within a lambda function. Lambda functions are limited to expressions, which means they can only include things that return a value.\n\nTo fix this and achieve similar functionality, you have two options:\n\n1. **Upgrade to Python 3**: In Python 3, `print` is a function, and you can use it inside a lambda. Here's how it would look:\n\n   ```python\n   lambda: print(\"x\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Use a regular function**: If you need to stick with Python 2 and want to use `print`, you'll need to define a regular function instead of a lambda:\n\n   ```python\n   def print_x():\n       print \"x\"\n   ```\n\nThis is because lambda expressions in Python 2 are not designed to execute statements like `print`. Instead, they are meant for simple operations that return a value."
