        "content": "Certainly! To find all possible pairs of numbers from the given list that satisfy the conditions (their product is divisible by both 3 and 5, and their sum is a multiple of 7), you can use nested loops to iterate through the list and check each pair for the given conditions. Here's how you can modify the Swift code:\n\n```swift\nlet numList = [12, 17, 23, 36, 45, 52, 69, 71, 88, 99]\n\nfor i in 0..<numList.count {\n    for j in i+1..<numList.count {\n        let num1 = numList[i]\n        let num2 = numList[j]\n        \n        let product = num1 * num2\n        let sum = num1 + num2\n        \n        if product % 3 == 0 && product % 5 == 0 && sum % 7 == 0 {\n            print(\"Pair: (\\(num1), \\(num2))\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Nested Loops**: The outer loop iterates through each element of the list, and the inner loop iterates through the elements that come after the current element to form pairs.\n- **Product Condition**: We check if the product of the pair is divisible by both 3 and 5 (`product % 3 == 0` and `product % 5 == 0`).\n- **Sum Condition**: We check if the sum of the pair is a multiple of 7 (`sum % 7 == 0`).\n- **Printing Pairs**: If both conditions are satisfied, the pair is printed.\n\nThis code will print all pairs that satisfy the conditions from the given list of two-digit numbers."
