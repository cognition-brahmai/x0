I have a dictionary 'grades' and a list 'students', and I need to ensure that all the names in 'students' exist as keys in 'grades'. The 'grades' dictionary can contain more names, but all the names in 'students' should be in 'grades'. I tried using 'if students in grades' but it didn't work. Here are my dictionary and list:\n\n```python\ngrades = {\n        'alex' : 11,\n        'bob'  : 10,\n        'john' : 14,\n        'peter': 7\n       }\nstudents = ('alex', 'john')\n```"

        "content": "To check if all the keys from the `students` list exist in the `grades` dictionary, you can use a loop, a generator expression, or the `all()` function. Here's how you can do it using the `all()` function, which is both concise and efficient:\n\n```python\ngrades = {\n    'alex': 11,\n    'bob': 10,\n    'john': 14,\n    'peter': 7\n}\nstudents = ('alex', 'john')\n\n# Check if all students are keys in the grades dictionary\nall_exist = all(student in grades for student in students)\n\nprint(all_exist)  # This will print True if all students are in grades, False otherwise\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of how this works:\n\n- `student in grades` checks if each student in the `students` list is a key in the `grades` dictionary.\n- `all()` takes an iterable and returns `True` if all elements in the iterable are `True`. In this case, it will return `True` if all students are found as keys in the `grades` dictionary."
