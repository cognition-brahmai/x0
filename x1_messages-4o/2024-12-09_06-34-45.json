        "content": "The `requests` package in Python does not cache responses by default. Each time you make a request using `requests.get()` or any other method in the `requests` library, it performs a new HTTP request and fetches fresh data from the server.\n\nIf you need caching functionality, you can use additional libraries like `requests-cache`, which adds a caching layer to `requests`. This library allows you to cache HTTP responses and reduce the number of requests sent to the server, improving performance for repeated requests.\n\nTo use `requests-cache`, you can install it via pip:\n\n```bash\npip install requests-cache\n```\n\nHere is an example of how to use `requests-cache` to cache responses:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport requests_cache\n\n# Initialize the cache\nrequests_cache.install_cache('my_cache', expire_after=300)  # Cache expires after 300 seconds\n\n# Make a request\nresp = requests.get('https://some-website.com')\n\n# The response will be cached\nprint(resp.from_cache)  # True if the response was returned from cache\n```\n\nTo clear the cache, you can use the following command:\n\n```python\nrequests_cache.clear()\n```\n\nThis will remove all cached responses, allowing you to make fresh requests to the server. Keep in mind that caching behavior can be customized further, such as setting different expiration times for different requests or using different backends for storage."
