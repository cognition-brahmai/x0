You have gathered data on the population changes of the Cherokee Nation during this time period, as shown below:\nYear | Population\n--- | ---\n1820 | 22,000\n1830 | 16,000\n1840 | 9,000\n1850 | 4,000\nUsing this data, can you determine the average rate of population decline per year for the Cherokee Nation during the period of the Indian Removal Act? What factors do you think may have contributed to this decline?"

This journey was harsh and led to significant loss of life due to exposure, disease, and starvation.\n\n2. **Diseases**: The Cherokee and other tribes faced exposure to new diseases brought by Europeans, to which they had little immunity, resulting in high mortality rates.\n\n3. **Conflict and Violence**: Increased conflict with European settlers and the U.S. government often resulted in violence and death.\n\n4. **Loss of Livelihood**: The forced relocation disrupted traditional ways of life, leading to economic hardship and famine, which further contributed to population decline.\n\n5. **Psychological and Social Impact**: The traumatic experience of removal and the loss of their homeland had profound psychological and social impacts, which could have contributed to the decline in population through reduced birth rates and increased mortality.\n\nThese factors collectively contributed to the significant population decline of the Cherokee Nation during this period."
