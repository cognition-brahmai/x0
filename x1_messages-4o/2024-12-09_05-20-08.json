I tried using the `random.choice(my_dict.keys())` method to achieve this, but I am encountering the following error: `'dict_keys' object does not support indexing`. Can anyone guide me on how to solve this problem?"

        "content": "Certainly! The error you're encountering is because in Python 3, `my_dict.keys()` returns a view object, not a list, and `random.choice()` expects a sequence (like a list or a tuple) as its argument. To solve this issue, you need to convert the view object to a list or tuple first. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nmy_dict = {('cloudy', 1): 10, ('windy', 1): 20}\n\n# Convert the keys to a list\nkeys_list = list(my_dict.keys())\n\n# Use random.choice on the list of keys\nrandom_key = random.choice(keys_list)\n\nprint(\"Randomly selected key:\", random_key)\n```\n\nThis will allow you to pick a key randomly from the dictionary without encountering the error."
