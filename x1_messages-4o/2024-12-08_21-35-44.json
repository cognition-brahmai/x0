The poems should also follow the 5-7-5 syllable pattern and include a reference to a specific season. Please provide SQL code to retrieve these poems from my database."

        "content": "To retrieve poems in haiku format from your database that meet the specified criteria, you would typically need a database schema that includes tables and columns to store the poem text, tree references, metaphorical elements, and seasonal references. Assuming you have a table named `poems` with relevant columns, here is an example of how you might structure your SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT poem_text\nFROM poems\nWHERE \n    syllable_pattern = '5-7-5' AND\n    poem_text LIKE '%tree%' AND\n    poem_text LIKE '%season%' AND\n    (\n        poem_text LIKE '%spring%' OR\n        poem_text LIKE '%summer%' OR\n        poem_text LIKE '%autumn%' OR\n        poem_text LIKE '%winter%'\n    ) AND\n    (\n        poem_text LIKE '%change%' OR\n        poem_text LIKE '%transformation%' OR\n        poem_text LIKE '%rebirth%' OR\n        poem_text LIKE '%decay%' OR\n        poem_text LIKE '%renewal%'\n    );\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Table Structure**: This query assumes that you have a `poems` table with a column `poem_text` where the haikus are stored.\n\n2. **Syllable Pattern**: Since enforcing a syllable count directly in SQL can be complex, this query assumes you have a way to tag or identify poems with the `5-7-5` syllable pattern, possibly through a dedicated column `syllable_pattern`.\n\n3. **Tree Reference**: The query filters poems containing the word \"tree\". You can adjust this to match specific tree types as needed (e.g., `%oak%`, `%pine%`).\n\n4. **Seasonal Reference**: The query checks for any of the four seasons. You can narrow this down if you want to search for a specific season.\n\n5. **Metaphorical Element**: It looks for various words related to change. You can update this list based on the specific metaphorical elements you're interested in.\n\nPlease adjust column names and logic according to your actual database schema and contents."
