I'm running an OpenCV GPU example code, bgfg_segm.cpp. The code compiles successfully, but I get an \"OpenCV Error: No GPU support\" error when I try to run it. My system is running Windows 7 (32-bit), Visual Studio 2008, nVidia Quadro 1000M with driver version 301.27, OpenCV 2.4.3rc (using the precompiled libs that came with it), and CUDA Toolkit 4.2 with CUDA SDK. I can run .exe files in C:\\ProgramData\\NVIDIA Corporation\\NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 4.2\\C\\bin\\win32\\Release without any errors, so CUDA seems to be working fine. What am I missing here to get OpenCV GPU support to work properly?"

        "content": "To get OpenCV GPU support working properly, there are several aspects you might need to check and configure:\n\n1. **Verify OpenCV GPU Support**: Ensure that the version of OpenCV you are using is compiled with CUDA support. The precompiled libraries you are using might not have GPU support enabled. You can download the source code and compile it yourself with CUDA support enabled.\n\n2. **Check CUDA Toolkit and OpenCV Compatibility**: Make sure that the CUDA Toolkit version (4.2 in your case) is compatible with the OpenCV version (2.4.3rc). You might need to refer to the OpenCV documentation to confirm compatibility.\n\n3. **Build OpenCV from Source with CUDA**: \n   - Download the OpenCV source code.\n   - Use CMake to configure the build. Make sure to set the `WITH_CUDA` flag to `ON`.\n   - Specify the path to your CUDA Toolkit and SDK in CMake.\n   - Generate the solution and build it using Visual Studio 2008.\n\n4. **Verify Environment Variables**: Ensure that the environment variables for CUDA are correctly set. This includes `CUDA_PATH` and adding the CUDA `bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable.\n\n5. **Check GPU Compatibility**: Make sure that your NVIDIA Quadro 1000M is supported by the specific version of OpenCV and CUDA you are using. Check the compute capability of your GPU and ensure it is supported.\n\n6. **Driver Updates**: While you mentioned your driver version is 301.27, consider updating to the latest driver compatible with your GPU and CUDA version. Sometimes, driver issues can affect CUDA applications.\n\n7. **Sample Code and Libraries**: Ensure that the sample code (`bgfg_segm.cpp`) is linking against the correct OpenCV GPU libraries. Check the project properties in Visual Studio to ensure that the paths to the OpenCV and CUDA libraries are correctly set.\n\n8. **Project Configuration**: Double-check the Visual Studio project settings to ensure that the correct configurations are used (Debug/Release, x86/x64). The configurations should match the way OpenCV was compiled.\n\n9. **Run the OpenCV Test**: After rebuilding OpenCV with CUDA, it might be helpful to run some of the OpenCV GPU tests or samples to verify that the GPU functionality is working correctly.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"No GPU support\" error and get OpenCV GPU support running on your system."
