I am able to iterate over a fixed range of numbers like this:\n\n```bash\nfor i in {1..5}; do echo $i; done\n```\nThis gives me the output:\n\n```\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5\n```\nBut I'm having trouble when I try to replace one of the range endpoints with a variable. For instance, when I do this:\n\n```bash\nEND=5\nfor i in {1..$END}; do echo $i; done\n```\n\nIt doesn't work as expected and instead prints: `{1..5}`. How can I correctly iterate over this range using a variable?"

        "content": "In Bash, when you want to use a variable to define the range in a `for` loop, you can use the `seq` command or C-style syntax. The curly brace syntax `{1..$END}` does not work with variables because it does not perform variable expansion. Here are two common methods to achieve this:\n\n### Using `seq`\n\nYou can use the `seq` command to generate the range of numbers. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```bash\nEND=5\nfor i in $(seq 1 $END); do\n  echo $i\ndone\n```\n\n### Using C-style `for` loop\n\nIf you're using Bash version 3.0 or newer, you can use the C-style syntax for the `for` loop:\n\n```bash\nEND=5\nfor (( i=1; i<=END; i++ )); do\n  echo $i\ndone\n```\n\nBoth of these methods should give you the desired result of printing numbers from 1 to 5, with the range defined by the variable `END`."
