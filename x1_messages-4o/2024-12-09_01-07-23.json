For example, when I try to access the 'handlers' sub-module from the 'logging' module, I encounter an AttributeError. Here is the code I used and the traceback I received:\n\n```python\n>>> import logging\n>>> logging.handlers\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nAttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'handlers'\n>>> import logging.handlers\n>>> logging.handlers\n<module 'logging.handlers' from '/usr/lib/python2.6/logging/handlers.pyc'>\n```\n\nWhy does this happen?"

        "content": "This behavior you observed with Python modules is related to how modules and sub-modules are imported and accessed.\n\nWhen you import a module using `import logging`, only the top-level module (`logging` in this case) is imported. The sub-modules within it, like `logging.handlers`, are not automatically imported. This is because importing sub-modules can be expensive in terms of memory and time, especially if they are not needed.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what happens in your example:\n\n1. **`import logging`**: This imports only the top-level `logging` module. At this stage, `logging.handlers` is not yet imported, which is why trying to access `logging.handlers` directly results in an `AttributeError`.\n\n2. **`import logging.handlers`**: This explicitly imports the `handlers` sub-module of the `logging` module. After this import statement, `logging.handlers` becomes accessible because the sub-module has been loaded into memory.\n\nThe reason for this design is to keep the import process efficient. Python allows you to import only the parts of a module you need, which can help reduce memory usage and improve loading times.\n\nTo avoid the `AttributeError`, you can either:\n\n- Import the specific sub-module you need, as you've done: `import logging.handlers`\n- Use a single import statement to access the sub-module directly, like this: `from logging import handlers`\n\nBy using these methods, you ensure that the sub-module is available to your code when you need it."
