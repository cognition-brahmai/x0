I have libffi installed in a few places, like the Xcode OS X SDK, and from homebrew, but I don't know how to instruct pip to look for it. The complete error message is as follows:\n\n```\nDownloading/unpacking bcrypt==1.0.2 (from -r requirements.txt (line 41))\nRunning setup.py egg_info for package bcrypt\nOS/X: confusion between 'cc' versus 'gcc' (see issue 123)\nwill not use '__thread' in the C code\nc/_cffi_backend.c:14:10: fatal error: 'ffi.h' file not found\n#include <ffi.h>\n         ^\n1 error generated.\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n...[truncated for brevity]\ndistutils.errors.DistutilsError: Setup script exited with error: command 'cc' failed with exit status 1\nCommand python setup.py egg_info failed with error code 1 in /Users/cody/virtualenvs/analytics/build/bcrypt\n```\nCan anyone suggest a possible solution?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to the inability of the Python package installer (pip) to find the `ffi.h` file, which is part of the `libffi` library. This usually happens when the development headers for `libffi` are not installed or not located in a directory that the compiler is searching. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Install Xcode Command Line Tools**: Make sure you have the Xcode command line tools installed, as they are necessary for compiling native extensions.\n\n   ```bash\n   xcode-select --install\n   ```\n\n2. **Install libffi using Homebrew**: If you haven't already, install `libffi` using Homebrew, which is a package manager for macOS. This will also ensure that the development headers are installed.\n\n   ```bash\n   brew install libffi\n   ```\n\n3. **Set environment variables**: You may need to set some environment variables so that the compiler can find the `libffi` installation:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig\"\n   export LDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib\"\n   export CPPFLAGS=\"-I/usr/local/opt/libffi/include\"\n   ```\n\n   If you are using a different shell (e.g., zsh, fish), make sure to adjust these commands accordingly.\n\n4. **Use pkg-config**: Ensure that `pkg-config` is installed via Homebrew, as it helps in locating the `ffi.h` file.\n\n   ```bash\n   brew install pkg-config\n   ```\n\n5. **Reinstall bcrypt**: Now try to reinstall the `bcrypt` package with pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install bcrypt\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, the pip installer should be able to find the `ffi.h` file and compile the necessary native extensions for the `bcrypt` package. If you continue to encounter issues, ensure that your `PATH` and other environment variables are correctly set, and consider restarting your terminal or system to apply the changes."
