Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:\n\n1. **Ensure Python and pip are installed:**\n   - First, make sure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n   - During the installation, ensure you check the option \"Add Python to PATH\".\n   - After installation, open Command Prompt (you can search for \"cmd\" in the start menu).\n   - Type `python --version` and `pip --version` to verify that both Python and pip are installed correctly.\n\n2. **Install simplejson using pip:**\n   - In the Command Prompt, run the following command:\n     ```bash\n     pip install simplejson\n     ```\n   - This command will download and install the `simplejson` package from the Python Package Index (PyPI).\n\n3. **Verify the installation:**\n   - To ensure `simplejson` is installed correctly, you can try importing it in a Python script or directly in the Python interactive shell.\n   - Open Command Prompt and type `python` to start the Python interactive shell.\n   - Enter the following command:\n     ```python\n     import simplejson\n     print(simplejson.__version__)\n     ```\n   - If there are no errors and the version number is printed, then the installation was successful.\n\nThat\u2019s it! You should now have the `simplejson` package installed and ready to use for your Twitter application. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for further assistance."
