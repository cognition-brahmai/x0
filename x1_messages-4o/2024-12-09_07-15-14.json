        "content": "I have installed anaconda to use pandas and scipy. I am following pandas tutorials and they instruct me to open the ipython notebook using `ipython notebook --pylab==inline`. But when I try to do that, I get an error message - \"Support for specifying --pylab on the command line has been removed. Please use '%pylab = inline' or '%matplotlib =inline' in the notebook itself\". When I try to use those commands in the notebook, they don't seem to work. Also, when I try to plot data using `plot(arange(10))`, I get another error saying \"name 'plot' is not defined.\" Furthermore, when I try to plot data from a .csv file, it returns \"matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0xebf8b70\" instead of the plot. Can someone help me solve this?"

        "content": "It sounds like you're encountering a few issues related to using matplotlib with Jupyter notebooks after installing Anaconda. Let's address each of these issues step by step:\n\n1. **Starting the Jupyter Notebook:**\n   The error message regarding `--pylab` indicates that the command-line option is no longer supported. Instead, you should start the Jupyter Notebook server with the following command:\n   ```bash\n   jupyter notebook\n   ```\n   This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your default web browser.\n\n2. **Using `%pylab` or `%matplotlib`:**\n   Inside a Jupyter Notebook cell, you can enable inline plotting by using the following magic command:\n   ```python\n   %matplotlib inline\n   ```\n   This command ensures that plots are displayed within the notebook itself.\n\n3. **Plotting Data:**\n   To use plotting functions like `plot`, make sure you have imported the necessary libraries. Here's a basic setup you can use in a notebook cell:\n   ```python\n   import numpy as np\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n   # Now you can use plot\n   plt.plot(np.arange(10))\n   plt.show()\n   ```\n\n4. **Reading and Plotting Data from a CSV File:**\n   If you're using pandas to read a CSV file and want to plot it, ensure you have imported pandas and used the correct syntax. Here's an example:\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n\n   # Read data from CSV\n   df = pd.read_csv('yourfile.csv')\n\n   # Plot the data\n   df.plot()\n   plt.show()\n   ```\n   The return value like \"matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0xebf8b70\" is simply a reference to the plot object, which is normal. Using `plt.show()` will display the actual plot.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issues you're facing and successfully plot your data within a Jupyter Notebook. Let me know if you have any further questions!"
