I need the code to be written in C or C++, and it should work at both configure-time, when the CUDA toolkit isn't available, and at run-time, when the binary isn't compiled with CUDA support. I believe this information can be obtained through the driver API, but I'm not sure about the details. Can you provide the steps to fulfill this requirement and suggest if there is any open-source code available? Also, I initially need this code for Linux, but eventually, it should be platform-independent, covering x86/AMD64 for Linux, Mac OS, and Windows at least."

        "content": "Extracting specific information about NVIDIA GPUs, such as the compute capability and the GPU name, without linking against the CUDA libraries is indeed possible by directly interacting with the NVIDIA driver. Here's a general approach to achieve this using the NVIDIA Management Library (NVML), which provides a C-based API for querying GPU information. NVML is installed with the NVIDIA driver, so you don't need the CUDA toolkit for this.\n\n### Steps to Query GPU Information Using NVML\n\n1. **Set Up NVML**: Ensure that you have the NVIDIA driver installed. NVML is part of the driver package and typically resides in `/usr/lib/nvidia-<version>/libnvidia-ml.so`.\n\n2. **Initialize NVML**: Before querying any GPU information, initialize the NVML library.\n\n3. **Get Handle for GPUs**: Use NVML API functions to get handles to the GPUs present on the system.\n\n4. **Query GPU Information**: Using these handles, you can query for the name and compute capability (CUDA version).\n\n5. **Clean Up**: Finalize the NVML to clean up resources.\n\nHere's a simple C code snippet demonstrating the above steps:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <nvml.h>\n\nvoid check_nvml_error(nvmlReturn_t result, const char *message) {\n    if (result != NVML_SUCCESS) {\n        fprintf(stderr, \"%s: %s\\n\", message, nvmlErrorString(result));\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    nvmlReturn_t result;\n    nvmlDevice_t device;\n    char name[NVML_DEVICE_NAME_BUFFER_SIZE];\n    int major, minor;\n\n    // Initialize NVML\n    result = nvmlInit();\n    check_nvml_error(result, \"Failed to initialize NVML\");\n\n    // Get the number of GPUs\n    unsigned int device_count;\n    result = nvmlDeviceGetCount(&device_count);\n    check_nvml_error(result, \"Failed to get device count\");\n\n    for (unsigned int i = 0; i < device_count; i++) {\n        // Get the device handle\n        result = nvmlDeviceGetHandleByIndex(i, &device);\n        check_nvml_error(result, \"Failed to get handle for device\");\n\n        // Get the name of the GPU\n        result = nvmlDeviceGetName(device, name, NVML_DEVICE_NAME_BUFFER_SIZE);\n        check_nvml_error(result, \"Failed to get device name\");\n\n        // Get the compute capability\n        result = nvmlDeviceGetCudaComputeCapability(device, &major, &minor);\n        check_nvml_error(result, \"Failed to get compute capability\");\n\n        printf(\"GPU %d: %s\\n\", i, name);\n        printf(\"Compute Capability: %d.%d\\n\", major, minor);\n    }\n\n    // Finalize NVML\n    result = nvmlShutdown();\n    check_nvml_error(result, \"Failed to shutdown NVML\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Platform Independence\n\n- **Linux**: Use `-lnvidia-ml` to link against the NVML library when compiling.\n- **Windows**: Use `nvml.dll` which is included with the NVIDIA driver. You may need to dynamically load it at runtime using `LoadLibrary`.\n- **Mac OS**: NVIDIA support on Mac is limited and Apple does not officially support CUDA on recent macOS versions. However, the process would be similar to Linux if you have the necessary libraries.\n\n### Compilation\n\nCompile with:\n\n```sh\ngcc -o gpu_info gpu_info.c -lnvidia-ml\n```\n\n### Note\n\n- **Driver Version**: Ensure your NVIDIA driver version supports NVML as some functions might not be available in older versions.\n- **Error Handling**: The above code includes basic error handling for NVML functions. You might want to expand this for more robust applications.\n- **Dependencies**: Ensure that your build environment can locate the NVML headers and library files.\n\nThis approach should help you gather the desired GPU information across different platforms without needing the CUDA toolkit at compile-time or run-time."
