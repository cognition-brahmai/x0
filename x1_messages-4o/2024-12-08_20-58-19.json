Let's go through the process:\n\n1. **Generate Prime Numbers:** Start by listing some of the smallest prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, etc.\n\n2. **Calculate Sums:** Calculate the sums of these prime numbers in different combinations, ensuring that each pair of primes is different. \n\n3. **Count the Number of Ways:** For each sum, count the number of unique pairs of primes that produce that particular sum.\n\n4. **Identify the Target:** We are looking for the smallest sum that can be expressed in exactly 5 ways.\n\nAfter going through these calculations, you will find that the number 34 is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two different prime numbers in exactly 5 ways:\n\n- 3 + 31 = 34\n- 5 + 29 = 34\n- 11 + 23 = 34\n- 13 + 21 = 34\n- 17 + 17 = 34\n\nHere is the result in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"smallest_integer\": 34\n}\n```"
