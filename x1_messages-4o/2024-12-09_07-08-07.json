Can I retrieve the file names of the images that were loaded in the same order as they were generated?

For that, I need to get the file names that were generated using `train_generator.next()` method. I need to ensure that the ordering of the `x` variable and the list of the file names that I get is the same. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To retrieve the filenames of images in the same order as they are generated by `ImageDataGenerator`'s `flow_from_directory`, you can utilize the `train_generator.index_array` attribute, which provides the indices of the files in the current batch. By using these indices, you can access the filenames in the correct order from the `train_generator.filenames` list. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator\n\ndatagen = ImageDataGenerator(\n    rotation_range=3,\n    fill_mode='nearest',\n    width_shift_range=0.2,\n    height_shift_range=0.2,\n    horizontal_flip=True\n)\n\ntrain_generator = datagen.flow_from_directory(\n    path+'/train',\n    target_size=(224, 224),\n    batch_size=batch_size,\n    shuffle=True  # Ensure this is True for random batches\n)\n\na = np.arange(8).reshape(2, 4)\n\ndef generate():\n    while True:\n        x, y = train_generator.next()\n        batch_indices = train_generator.index_array\n\n        # Retrieve filenames for the current batch using indices\n        batch_filenames = [train_generator.filenames[i] for i in batch_indices]\n\n        # Print or use the filenames as needed\n        print(batch_filenames)\n\n        yield [x], [a, y]\n\n# Now you can use the generator for training\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **shuffle=True**: Ensure that `shuffle` is set to `True` in `flow_from_directory` if you want the batches to be shuffled. If you want the data to be processed in the order it is stored, set `shuffle=False`.\n\n2. **Accessing Filenames**: Use `train_generator.index_array` to get the indices of images in the current batch, and then use these indices to access `train_generator.filenames` to get the filenames in the correct order.\n\nThis ensures that you have the correct file names corresponding to the images in each batch, allowing you to load additional data such as bounding box coordinates from a JSON file using these filenames."
