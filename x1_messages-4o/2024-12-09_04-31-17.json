        "content": "Certainly! In Python, if you have a file object, you can easily get the name of the file using the `name` attribute of the file object. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Open a file\nfile = open('example.txt', 'r')\n\n# Get the name of the file\nfile_name = file.name\n\n# Print the name of the file\nprint(\"The name of the open file is:\", file_name)\n\n# Don't forget to close the file\nfile.close()\n```\n\nIn this example, `file.name` will give you the name of the file that is currently open. Note that this will give you the path used to open the file, which may be a relative or absolute path depending on how you opened it. If you want just the base name of the file without the path, you can use `os.path.basename`:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Open a file\nfile = open('example.txt', 'r')\n\n# Get the base name of the file\nfile_base_name = os.path.basename(file.name)\n\n# Print the base name of the file\nprint(\"The base name of the open file is:\", file_base_name)\n\n# Don't forget to close the file\nfile.close()\n```\n\nThis will print just the file name, excluding any directory components."
