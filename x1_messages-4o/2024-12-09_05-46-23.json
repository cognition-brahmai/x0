I've referred to the documentation for random sampling in Python and found the function \"random.uniform\" which seems to be close to what I need but it only returns a single element, not an array. I'm looking for a function that would allow me to generate an array of 50 random non-unique floats (repetitions are allowed) uniformly distributed in the range [0.5, 13.3]. I am looking for something like the following function:\n\n```python\nran_floats = some_function(low=0.5, high=13.3, size=50)\n```\nDoes such a function exist?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this using NumPy, which is a powerful library for numerical computations in Python. NumPy has a function called `numpy.random.uniform` that allows you to generate an array of random floats within a specified range. Here's how you can use it to generate an array of 50 random floats uniformly distributed in the range [0.5, 13.3]:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nran_floats = np.random.uniform(low=0.5, high=13.3, size=50)\nprint(ran_floats)\n```\n\nThis will give you an array of 50 random floats, as required. NumPy is very efficient and well-suited for such tasks, so it's a great choice for your needs."
