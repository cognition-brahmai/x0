Currently, I am using a function with a for loop to iterate through the list and check each value, but I was wondering if there is a better way to achieve this, especially when dealing with larger data sets."

        "content": "To efficiently check if all the values in both lists are equal to or greater than 30, you can use Python's `all()` function combined with a generator expression. This approach is more concise and can be more performant for larger datasets since it stops checking as soon as it finds a value that doesn't meet the condition. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nmy_list1 = [30, 34, 56]\nmy_list2 = [29, 500, 43]\n\n# Check if all values in my_list1 are >= 30\nall_greater_equal_30_list1 = all(value >= 30 for value in my_list1)\n\n# Check if all values in my_list2 are >= 30\nall_greater_equal_30_list2 = all(value >= 30 for value in my_list2)\n\n# Overall check for both lists\nall_greater_equal_30 = all_greater_equal_30_list1 and all_greater_equal_30_list2\n\nprint(\"All values in my_list1 are >= 30:\", all_greater_equal_30_list1)\nprint(\"All values in my_list2 are >= 30:\", all_greater_equal_30_list2)\nprint(\"All values in both lists are >= 30:\", all_greater_equal_30)\n```\n\nThis code snippet will check each list separately and then combine the results to determine if all values in both lists meet the condition. If you're dealing with more complex conditions or larger datasets, this method remains efficient and easy to read."
