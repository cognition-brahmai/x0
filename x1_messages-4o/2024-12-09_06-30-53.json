I am trying to prompt the user to input values, which are then printed out in a list, with \"and\" inserted before the end. The output should look something like this: \"apples, bananas, tofu, and cats\". However, my current output has an extra comma at the end like this: \"apples, bananas, tofu, and cats,\". I can't figure out how to remove this final output comma. Here is my current code: \n\n```python\ndef lister():\n    listed = []\n    while True:\n        print('type what you want to be listed or type nothing to exit')\n        inputted = input()\n        if inputted == '':\n            break\n        else:\n            listed.append(inputted+',')\n    listed.insert(-1, 'and')\n    for i in listed:\n        print(i, end=' ')\nlister()\n```\nHow can I remove the final output comma from this program?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired output without an extra comma at the end, you can modify your code to handle the joining of the list items more effectively. Instead of appending a comma to each item when you add it to the list, handle the formatting when you print the list. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef lister():\n    listed = []\n    while True:\n        print('type what you want to be listed or type nothing to exit')\n        inputted = input()\n        if inputted == '':\n            break\n        else:\n            listed.append(inputted)\n    \n    if len(listed) > 1:\n        # Join all elements except the last one with ', ' and add 'and ' before the last element\n        output = ', '.join(listed[:-1]) + ', and ' + listed[-1]\n    elif listed:  # if there's only one item in the list\n        output = listed[0]\n    else:\n        output = ''\n\n    print(output)\n\nlister()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. Append items to the list without adding a comma.\n2. After you've collected all items, check the length of the list:\n   - If there are more than one items, join all except the last one with `', '`, then concatenate `', and '` before the last item.\n   - If there's only one item, simply print that item.\n   - If the list is empty, set the output to an empty string.\n3. Print the formatted string. \n\nThis approach ensures that the output format will match your requirement without an extra comma at the end."
