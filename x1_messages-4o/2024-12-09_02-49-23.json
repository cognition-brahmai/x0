The prediction server takes a single observation and outputs a prediction. I'm trying to use patsy, but I'm facing an issue. When a single prediction comes in, how can I convert it to the right shape so that it appears like a row of the training data? I'm unable to access the DesignInfo to build the DesignMatrix for the new data. I also tried pickling it but it seems it's not supported yet. Is there a good way to persist patsy DesignInfo? \n\nHere's the code I've been using:\n\n```python\n# offline model training\nimport patsy\ndata = {'animal': ['cat', 'cat', 'dog', 'raccoon'], 'cuteness': [3, 6, 10, 4]}\neq_string = \"cuteness ~ animal\"\ndmats = patsy.dmatrices(eq_string,data)\ndesign_info = dmats[1].design_info\ntrain_model(dmats)\n\n# online predictions\ninput_data = {'animal': ['raccoon']}\n# if the DesignInfo were available, I could do this:\nnew_dmat = build_design_matrices([design_info], input_data)\nmake_prediction(new_dmat, trained_model)\n```\n\nAnd here's the output I'm getting:\n\n```python\n[DesignMatrix with shape (1, 3)\n   Intercept  animal[T.dog]  animal[T.raccoon]\n           1              0                  1\n   Terms:\n     'Intercept' (column 0)\n     'animal' (columns 1:3)]\n```\n\nHow can I make the prediction server aware of the number of other categories of animals in the training data and their order?"

        "content": "To address your issue with using Patsy for transforming new data for predictions, you need a way to persist the `DesignInfo` so that it can be reused when new observations come in. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Serialize the DesignInfo**: Although Patsy objects like `DesignInfo` aren't directly serializable, you can extract the necessary components and store them in a more serializable format.\n\n2. **Reconstruct the DesignMatrix from serialized info**: When you receive new data, use the serialized information to build the design matrix for new observations.\n\nHere's an approach using JSON serialization for the `DesignInfo`:\n\n### Serialization\n\n1. Extract and serialize terms and factor information from `DesignInfo`:\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport patsy\n\n# Serialize design info\ndef serialize_design_info(design_info):\n    return json.dumps({\n        'factor_infos': {factor: design_info.factor_infos[factor]._name_list\n                         for factor in design_info.factor_infos},\n        'terms': [term.name() for term in design_info.terms]\n    })\n\n# Serialize the design info\nserialized_design_info = serialize_design_info(design_info)\n```\n\n2. Save the serialized info to a file or database where the prediction server can access it.\n\n### Deserialization and Prediction\n\n1. Deserialize the design info when making predictions:\n\n```python\n# Deserialize design info\ndef deserialize_design_info(serialized_info):\n    info_dict = json.loads(serialized_info)\n    factor_infos = {factor: patsy.eval.EvalFactor(factor)\n                    for factor in info_dict['factor_infos']}\n    terms = [patsy.Term([patsy.eval.EvalFactor(term)]) for term in info_dict['terms']]\n    return patsy.DesignInfo(terms=terms, factor_infos=factor_infos)\n\n# Deserialize the design info\ndeserialized_design_info = deserialize_design_info(serialized_design_info)\n```\n\n2. Use the deserialized design info to build new design matrices:\n\n```python\n# Online predictions\ninput_data = {'animal': ['raccoon']}\nnew_dmat = patsy.build_design_matrices([deserialized_design_info], input_data)\n\n# Make prediction\nmake_prediction(new_dmat, trained_model)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Serialization**: By extracting the names and terms from the `DesignInfo`, you create a JSON-compatible structure. This can be stored in a file or database.\n\n- **Deserialization**: You reconstruct the `DesignInfo` using the stored JSON data, allowing you to create a `DesignMatrix` for new observations.\n\nThis approach should allow you to handle new observations with the same design matrix structure as your training data, ensuring consistency in your predictive model."
