This method returns a dictionary where the keys are the index names. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Assuming you have already established a connection to Elasticsearch as 'es'\n\n# Retrieve all indexes\nindices = es.indices.get_alias(\"*\")\n\n# Extract and print the index names\nindex_names = list(indices.keys())\nprint(index_names)\n```\n\nThis code snippet will give you a list of all the index names in your Elasticsearch cluster. The `get_alias(\"*\")` function fetches all the indices and their associated aliases, and by extracting the keys of the returned dictionary, you get the index names."
