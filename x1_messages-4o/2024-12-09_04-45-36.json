        "content": "I am having difficulty creating a dictionary with a string for each key and a lambda function for each value. I suspect the issue lies either in my attempt to store a lambda in a dictionary or in the usage of a shortcut operator in my lambda. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndict = {\n    'Applied_poison_rating_bonus': \n        (lambda target, magnitude: target.equipmentPoisonRatingBonus += magnitude)\n}\n```\n\nWhen I run this, I get a `SyntaxError: invalid syntax` with the error pointing to the `+=` operator. Are shortcut operators not allowed in lambdas? If not, how can I create a method that only knows the key to this dictionary and is able to alter the field defined in my code? Would a call to `eval()` help? I have also been suggested to use the `functools.partial()` method. Would that be a viable solution?"

        "content": "In Python, lambda functions are meant to be concise, single-expression functions, and they don't allow statements, such as assignments or augmented assignments like `+=`. You can only perform expressions in a lambda, which is why you encounter a `SyntaxError` with the `+=` operator.\n\nTo work around this limitation, you can define a regular function instead of a lambda, which can include statements. If you must use a lambda for some reason, you'll need to adjust your approach. Here's how you can achieve a similar result using a regular function:\n\n```python\ndef apply_poison_rating_bonus(target, magnitude):\n    target.equipmentPoisonRatingBonus += magnitude\n\nactions = {\n    'Applied_poison_rating_bonus': apply_poison_rating_bonus\n}\n```\n\nIf you still want to use a lambda for some reason, you would need to restructure your approach. One option could be to use a lambda to call another function that performs the assignment:\n\n```python\ndef modify_poison_rating(target, magnitude):\n    target.equipmentPoisonRatingBonus += magnitude\n\nactions = {\n    'Applied_poison_rating_bonus': lambda target, magnitude: modify_poison_rating(target, magnitude)\n}\n```\n\nRegarding `functools.partial`, it is useful for creating a new callable with some arguments or keywords fixed, but it won't help with assignment operations directly. `eval()` could theoretically be used, but it's generally not recommended due to potential security risks and decreased code readability.\n\nUltimately, using a regular function is the cleanest and most Pythonic approach in this situation. It provides clarity and maintains the ability to perform assignment operations."
