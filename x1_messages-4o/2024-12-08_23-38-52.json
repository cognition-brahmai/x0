        "content": "To store the factors of two equations in a JSON data structure, you can represent each equation with its corresponding coefficients and constants. For the given equations, the JSON structure can be organized as follows:\n\n### JSON Data Structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"equations\": [\n    {\n      \"equation\": \"12x + 3 = 15x - 5\",\n      \"factors\": {\n        \"lhs\": {\"x\": 12, \"constant\": 3},\n        \"rhs\": {\"x\": 15, \"constant\": -5}\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"equation\": \"8y + 12 = 6y - 15\",\n      \"factors\": {\n        \"lhs\": {\"y\": 8, \"constant\": 12},\n        \"rhs\": {\"y\": 6, \"constant\": -15}\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### C++ Program to Compare Factors:\n\nTo compare the factors of the equations stored in the JSON, you can use a JSON library like `nlohmann/json` to parse and manipulate JSON data in C++. Below is a simple program to compare these factors:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <nlohmann/json.hpp>\n\nusing json = nlohmann::json;\n\nint main() {\n    // Load JSON data from a file or inline string\n    std::ifstream file(\"equations.json\");\n    json data;\n    file >> data;\n\n    // Extract factors from the JSON structure\n    auto equations = data[\"equations\"];\n    auto eq1_factors = equations[0][\"factors\"];\n    auto eq2_factors = equations[1][\"factors\"];\n\n    // Compare the factors of the two equations\n    bool areLHSFactorsEqual = (eq1_factors[\"lhs\"][\"x\"] == eq2_factors[\"lhs\"][\"y\"] &&\n                               eq1_factors[\"lhs\"][\"constant\"] == eq2_factors[\"lhs\"][\"constant\"]);\n    bool areRHSFactorsEqual = (eq1_factors[\"rhs\"][\"x\"] == eq2_factors[\"rhs\"][\"y\"] &&\n                               eq1_factors[\"rhs\"][\"constant\"] == eq2_factors[\"rhs\"][\"constant\"]);\n\n    // Output the comparison result\n    std::cout << \"Comparison of LHS factors: \" << (areLHSFactorsEqual ? \"Equal\" : \"Not Equal\") << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Comparison of RHS factors: \" << (areRHSFactorsEqual ? \"Equal\" : \"Not Equal\") << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **JSON Structure**: The JSON structure stores each equation's coefficients and constants separately for the left-hand side (lhs) and right-hand side (rhs).\n\n2. **C++ Program**:\n   - **JSON Parsing**: Uses the `nlohmann/json` library to parse JSON data. Make sure to include the library in your project.\n   - **Factor Extraction**: Extracts the factors for both equations from the JSON.\n   - **Comparison**: Compares the coefficients and constants of the left-hand sides and right-hand sides of both equations.\n   - **Output**: Prints whether the factors of the equations are equal or not.\n\nEnsure you have the `nlohmann/json` library available in your development environment to run this program. You can install it via a package manager or include a single-header file from the library's GitHub repository."
