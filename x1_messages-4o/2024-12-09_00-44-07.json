I have a database with hundreds of thousands of forum posts and I am interested in tagging them in an unsupervised way, similar to StackOverflow's system. I came across a link (http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2660970&dl=ACM&coll=DL&CFID=522960920&CFTOKEN=15091676) that suggests it is SVM based. Can anyone verify if this is official or provide further insights?"

        "content": "StackOverflow's tag suggestion system is indeed an interesting topic. While there isn't an official detailed public documentation of the exact algorithms used, there are several insights and educated guesses based on research papers and community observations.\n\n1. **Machine Learning Models**: It's likely that StackOverflow uses machine learning models to suggest tags. Support Vector Machines (SVM) could be a part of this, as indicated by the paper you mentioned. SVMs are effective for text classification tasks, which makes them suitable for predicting tags based on the content of the posts.\n\n2. **Textual Analysis**: The system probably involves analyzing the text of the question, including the title and body, to identify relevant keywords and key phrases that correspond to existing tags.\n\n3. **Collaborative Filtering**: Involves using patterns from past data, such as tags commonly used together or tags frequently associated with certain types of questions.\n\n4. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), word embeddings, or more advanced models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) could be used to understand the content and context of questions.\n\n5. **Community Feedback and Iterative Learning**: The system might incorporate feedback loops where the tags' effectiveness is continually assessed based on user interactions, such as edits or tag votes, to improve the suggestions over time.\n\n6. **Unsupervised Approaches**: For your case, where you want to tag posts in an unsupervised way, you might explore clustering algorithms like K-Means or topic modeling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to group similar posts and infer potential tags.\n\nTo implement a similar system, you would need to:\n- Preprocess your data to clean and tokenize the text.\n- Train a model using your existing data, possibly using supervised methods if you have some labeled data or unsupervised methods if you don't.\n- Continuously update your model with new data to improve its accuracy over time.\n\nWhile specific details of StackOverflow's system may not be fully known, these general methodologies can guide you in developing a similar tagging system for your forum posts."
