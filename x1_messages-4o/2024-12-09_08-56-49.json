Here is a simple example:\n\n```python\ndef count_character_occurrences(string, character):\n    return string.count(character)\n\n# Example usage\nmy_string = \"hello world\"\ncharacter_to_count = \"o\"\ncount = count_character_occurrences(my_string, character_to_count)\nprint(f\"The character '{character_to_count}' appears {count} times in the string.\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `count_character_occurrences` takes two parameters: the string in which you want to count the character and the character you want to count. It uses the `.count()` method to find how many times the character appears in the string."
