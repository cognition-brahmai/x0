        "content": "The ImportError you're encountering is due to the way Python handles module imports within a package. When you're working within a package, you need to ensure that the imports are done relative to the package structure. Since you don't want to use relative imports or modify `sys.path`, you'll need to adjust your import statement in `testprinter.py` to reflect the package structure.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Use Absolute Imports Relative to the Package:**\n   Since `testmsg.py` is part of the `testapp` package, you should import it using the package name as a prefix.\n\n   Modify your `testprinter.py` file to use the following import statement:\n\n   ```python\n   from testapp import testmsg\n\n   print(\"The message is: {0}\".format(testmsg.MSG))\n   ```\n\n2. **Ensure the Package is Recognizable by Python:**\n   When running your script, make sure the `testapp` package is in the Python path. If you're running the script directly from the command line, navigate to the parent directory of `testapp` and run it as a module. For example:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m testapp.sub.testprinter\n   ```\n\n   This command treats `testapp` as a package and allows Python to correctly resolve the module imports.\n\n3. **Check `__init__.py` Files:**\n   Ensure that both `__init__.py` files (in `testapp` and `testapp/sub`) are present, as these files tell Python that the directories are packages.\n\nBy organizing your imports in this way, you'll maintain a clean package structure and avoid modifying `sys.path` or using relative imports."
