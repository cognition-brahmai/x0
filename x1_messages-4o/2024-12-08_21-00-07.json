The table has thousands of entries and I need to output the edited entries in the same format as the original. Can you provide an Excel code to achieve this task?\nHere is a sample Excel table for reference:\n| Column A        |\n|----------------|\n| john doe        |\n| jane smith      |\n| tom hanks       |\n| jennifer aniston|\nAnd I want to capitalize the first letter of each word to get:\n| Column A        |\n|----------------|\n| John Doe        |\n| Jane Smith      |\n| Tom Hanks       |\n| Jennifer Aniston|"

        "content": "To capitalize the first letter of each word in a column of an Excel table without using any built-in functions, you can use a macro written in VBA (Visual Basic for Applications). Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n1. **Open the Excel file** where you have your data.\n\n2. **Press `ALT` + `F11`** to open the VBA editor.\n\n3. In the VBA editor, **go to `Insert` > `Module`** to insert a new module.\n\n4. **Copy and paste the following VBA code** into the module:\n\n   ```vba\n   Sub CapitalizeFirstLetter()\n       Dim ws As Worksheet\n       Dim cell As Range\n       Dim words As Variant\n       Dim i As Integer\n       \n       ' Set the worksheet to the active sheet\n       Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets(\"Sheet1\") ' Change \"Sheet1\" to your sheet name if different\n       \n       ' Loop through each cell in the specified column\n       For Each cell In ws.Range(\"A1:A1000\") ' Adjust the range as needed\n           If Not IsEmpty(cell.Value) Then\n               words = Split(cell.Value, \" \")\n               For i = LBound(words) To UBound(words)\n                   words(i) = UCase(Left(words(i), 1)) & Mid(words(i), 2)\n               Next i\n               cell.Value = Join(words, \" \")\n           End If\n       Next cell\n   End Sub\n   ```\n\n5. **Modify the code** if necessary:\n   - Change `\"Sheet1\"` to the name of your worksheet.\n   - Adjust the range `\"A1:A1000\"` to match the actual range of your data.\n\n6. **Close the VBA editor** and return to Excel.\n\n7. **Run the macro**:\n   - Press `ALT` + `F8` to open the \"Macro\" dialog.\n   - Select `CapitalizeFirstLetter` from the list.\n   - Click `Run`.\n\nThis macro will loop through each cell in the specified range, split the text into words, capitalize the first letter of each word, and then join the words back together. The result will replace the original text in each cell."
