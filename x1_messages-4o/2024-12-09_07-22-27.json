However, when I run my project, I encounter an error stating `ImportError: No module named 'numpy'`. Despite this error, I can see a NumPy folder under `External libraries > Extended definitions` in my project bar. How can I resolve this import issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is likely due to PyCharm not being configured to use the same Python interpreter and environment where you installed NumPy. Here's how you can resolve this:\n\n1. **Verify the Interpreter:**\n   - Open your PyCharm project.\n   - Navigate to `File` > `Settings` (or `PyCharm` > `Preferences` on macOS).\n   - Go to `Project: <Your Project Name>` > `Python Interpreter`.\n   - Ensure that the interpreter selected is the one associated with your Miniconda environment where you've installed NumPy. If it's not, select the correct interpreter.\n\n2. **Check the Environment:**\n   - Make sure that the environment where NumPy is installed is activated. You might have installed NumPy in a different environment than the one currently active in PyCharm.\n   - To activate your Miniconda environment, run `conda activate <your-environment-name>` in the terminal.\n\n3. **Add the Interpreter:**\n   - If the correct environment is not listed, you can add it by clicking on the gear icon in the Python Interpreter settings and selecting `Add...`.\n   - Choose `Conda Environment` and specify the path to your Miniconda environment.\n\n4. **Synchronize PyCharm:**\n   - Once you've ensured that the correct interpreter is selected, PyCharm should synchronize and recognize all packages installed in that environment, including NumPy.\n\n5. **Reinstall NumPy:**\n   - If the above steps don't work, try reinstalling NumPy in the correct environment using the terminal within PyCharm:\n     ```\n     conda activate <your-environment-name>\n     conda install numpy\n     ```\n\n6. **Check for Multiple Interpreters:**\n   - It's possible that there are multiple Python installations on your machine, and PyCharm might be using a different one. Ensure that there are no conflicting installations.\n\n7. **Terminal Test:**\n   - Open the terminal in PyCharm and activate your environment, then try importing NumPy to see if it works there:\n     ```python\n     python -c \"import numpy; print(numpy.__version__)\"\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the import issue and successfully run your project with NumPy. If the problem persists, double-check the paths and make sure there are no conflicting Python environments."
