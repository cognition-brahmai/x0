        "content": "To create a 3D array of size (10, 10, 10) with unique random numbers between 0 and 100, we need to ensure that no two numbers appear in the same row, column, or depth. This is a challenging problem due to the constraints, so we'll need to carefully design the process for generating such an array.\n\nWe'll also implement a sorting algorithm that sorts each 2D slice of the 3D array based on the sum of the elements in each row in descending order.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to accomplish this:\n\n1. **Generate Unique Numbers**: Since the range 0-100 has only 101 numbers and we need 1000 unique numbers, we'll actually generate numbers within a larger range, say 0-999, to ensure uniqueness.\n\n2. **Create 3D Array**: Populate the 3D array with these unique numbers.\n\n3. **Sort Each 2D Slice**: For each 2D slice in the 3D array, sort the rows based on their sum in descending order.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python using NumPy:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Generate unique numbers\nunique_numbers = np.random.choice(range(1000), size=(10, 10, 10), replace=False)\n\n# Step 2: Create 3D array\narray_3d = unique_numbers\n\n# Step 3: Sort each 2D slice based on the sum of the elements in each row\ndef sort_2d_slice(slice_2d):\n    # Sort rows based on the sum of their elements in descending order\n    row_sums = slice_2d.sum(axis=1)\n    sorted_indices = np.argsort(-row_sums)\n    return slice_2d[sorted_indices]\n\n# Apply sorting to each 2D slice\nsorted_array_3d = np.array([sort_2d_slice(array_3d[i]) for i in range(array_3d.shape[0])])\n\n# Print the sorted array\nprint(\"Sorted 3D Array:\")\nprint(sorted_array_3d)\n```\n\n**Output of the Sorted Array:**\n\nSince the output is a 3D array, it will be quite large to display here. Running the above code will give you a sorted version of the 3D array where each 2D slice is sorted by the sum of the rows in descending order.\n\nNote: The approach used here ensures that each number in the 3D array is unique within the context of the entire array, rather than just within a specific row, column, or depth, which is a typical constraint for such problems."
