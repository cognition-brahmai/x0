I've been attempting to use the code from `inspect_checkpoint.py`, but I'm facing an error stating `AttributeError: module 'tensorflow.python' has no attribute 'tools'`. Here's the code I've been working with:\n\n```python\ntf.python.tools.inspect_checkpoint.print_tensors_in_checkpoint_file(file_name='./tmp/mdl_ckpt',tensor_name='',all_tensors='')\n```\n\nBut I'm receiving the following error:\n\n```python\nAttributeError: module 'tensorflow.python' has no attribute 'tools'\n```\n\nI'm unsure why it can't find tools or how to properly run the function in that file. Is there a way around this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to changes in the TensorFlow library's structure and APIs, particularly in newer versions of TensorFlow. The `inspect_checkpoint.py` script you are trying to use has likely been moved or refactored. To inspect variables in a checkpoint file, you can use the `tf.train` module that provides the necessary functionality. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using `tf.train.list_variables`**: This function lists all variables and their shapes in a checkpoint file.\n\n2. **Using `tf.train.load_variable`**: This function retrieves the value of a specific variable from a checkpoint file.\n\nHere's an example of how you can inspect tensors in a checkpoint file:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Path to the checkpoint file\ncheckpoint_path = './tmp/mdl_ckpt'\n\n# List all the variables in the checkpoint\nvariables = tf.train.list_variables(checkpoint_path)\n\n# Print all the variables and their shapes\nfor var_name, shape in variables:\n    print(f\"Variable Name: {var_name}, Shape: {shape}\")\n\n    # To load the value of a specific variable:\n    # value = tf.train.load_variable(checkpoint_path, var_name)\n    # print(f\"Value of {var_name}: {value}\")\n```\n\nMake sure you have the correct path to your checkpoint file. The above code will list all the variables stored in the checkpoint along with their shapes. If you want to inspect the actual values of the variables, you can use `tf.train.load_variable` as shown in the commented section.\n\nThis approach should work with TensorFlow 2.x, as it is compatible with the API changes made in the newer versions."
