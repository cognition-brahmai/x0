Here is my current code:\n\n```python\nfor a in b:\n    if criteria in list1:\n        print \"oh no\"\n        #Force loop i.e. force next iteration without going on\n    someList.append(a)\n```\n\nIn Java, I know that you can use `break` to exit a loop early. Is there an equivalent way to do this in Python?"

        "content": "In Python, if you want to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop, you can use the `continue` statement. If you want to completely exit the loop, you would use `break`. However, based on your description, it seems like you want to skip the current iteration when a certain condition is met, which means `continue` is what you're looking for. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nfor a in b:\n    if criteria in list1:\n        print(\"oh no\")\n        continue  # Skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next one\n    someList.append(a)\n```\n\nThis code will check if `criteria` is in `list1`. If it is, it will print \"oh no\" and then skip appending `a` to `someList`, immediately moving to the next iteration of the loop."
