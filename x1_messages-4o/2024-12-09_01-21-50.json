I tried using `import nltk` and `echo nltk.__version__` in the shell script, but it stops at the `import` line. I also tried `which nltk` in the Linux terminal, but it doesn't return anything even though nltk is installed. Additionally, if the package is not installed, how can I install it through the shell script?"

Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Create a shell script** that executes a Python command to get the version of the packages. You can also add logic to install the packages if they are not installed.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Function to check the version of a package\ncheck_version() {\n    package=$1\n    python -c \"import $package; print('$package version:', $package.__version__)\" 2>/dev/null\n    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then\n        echo \"$package is not installed. Installing $package...\"\n        pip install $package\n    else\n        echo \"$package is already installed.\"\n    fi\n}\n\n# Check version for nltk\ncheck_version nltk\n\n# Check version for scikit-learn\ncheck_version sklearn\n```\n\nThis script does the following:\n- Defines a function `check_version` to check if a package is installed and print its version.\n- If the package is not installed, it installs it using `pip`.\n- Calls the function for both `nltk` and `scikit-learn` (note for scikit-learn, you use `sklearn` in the import).\n\n2. **Run the script** by making it executable and executing it:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x check_versions.sh\n./check_versions.sh\n```\n\nThis approach will ensure that you know the version of the packages installed, and they will be installed if they are missing."
