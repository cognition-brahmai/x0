        "content": "The error you're encountering, `ImportError: cannot import name storage`, typically indicates that the `google-cloud-storage` library is not installed in your Python environment or that there is an issue with the package installation. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure the Library is Installed:**\n   Make sure that the `google-cloud-storage` package is installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install google-cloud-storage\n   ```\n\n   If you are using a virtual environment, ensure that the virtual environment is activated before running the above command.\n\n2. **Check for Correct Environment:**\n   If you have multiple Python environments, make sure you are executing the script in the environment where `google-cloud-storage` is installed. You can check which Python executable is being used by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   which python\n   ```\n\n   or on Windows:\n\n   ```bash\n   where python\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify Installation:**\n   After installing, you can verify that the package is correctly installed by listing installed packages:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip list | grep google-cloud-storage\n   ```\n\n   This should show you the installed version of `google-cloud-storage`.\n\n4. **Check for Conflicts:**\n   Ensure there are no conflicting package installations. Sometimes, a package might have been installed in a way that conflicts with other packages or with itself. You can try uninstalling and reinstalling the package:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall google-cloud-storage\n   pip install google-cloud-storage\n   ```\n\n5. **Check Python Path:**\n   Ensure that the script is running with the correct Python interpreter and that the path is correctly set up. Sometimes, issues with `PYTHONPATH` can cause imports to fail.\n\n6. **Permissions:**\n   Ensure you have the necessary permissions to install and use packages in your environment, especially if you're working on a managed environment or a shared server.\n\nOnce you ensure that the `google-cloud-storage` package is correctly installed and configured, your import statement should work without any issues. Try running your script again after these steps."
