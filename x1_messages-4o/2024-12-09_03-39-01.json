        "content": "The error you're encountering, `AttributeError: 'Flask' object has no attribute 'user_options'`, is likely due to a misconfiguration or mismatch between the version of Celery and Flask, or how Celery is being initialized with Flask.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify Package Versions**: Ensure that you are using compatible versions of Flask and Celery. As of Celery 4.x, there might be some changes compared to Celery 3.x, which you're currently using (3.1.15). Consider upgrading to a compatible version if possible.\n\n2. **Check Celery Initialization**: Make sure the `Celery` app is being initialized correctly and is separate from the Flask app. Sometimes `user_options` can be mistakenly attributed to `Flask` instead of `Celery`.\n\n3. **Use `Celery` App Correctly**: The `celery` instance should be properly configured and set up independent of Flask's own attributes. Ensure that `celery` is created and used as intended.\n\n4. **Fix Code**: Update the code to ensure compatibility between Flask and Celery:\n\n   ```python\n   from celery import Celery\n   from flask import Flask\n\n   def make_celery(app):\n       celery = Celery(\n           app.import_name,\n           broker=app.config['CELERY_BROKER_URL']\n       )\n       celery.conf.update(app.config)\n\n       class ContextTask(celery.Task):\n           abstract = True\n           def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n               with app.app_context():\n                   return super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)\n\n       celery.Task = ContextTask\n       return celery\n\n   app = Flask(__name__)\n   app.config.update(\n       CELERY_BROKER_URL='redis://localhost:6379/0',\n       CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND='redis://localhost:6379/0'\n   )\n\n   celery = make_celery(app)\n\n   @celery.task()\n   def add_together(a, b):\n       return a + b\n   ```\n\n5. **Upgrade Celery (Optional)**: If the problem persists, consider upgrading to a more recent version of Celery (e.g., 4.x or 5.x) and consult their latest documentation for any changes in the setup.\n\n6. **Run Celery Worker Correctly**: When running your Celery worker, ensure you're using the correct command that references your app correctly:\n\n   ```bash\n   celery -A your_module_name.celery worker\n   ```\n\n   Replace `your_module_name` with the name of the Python file (without the `.py` extension) where the `celery` instance is defined.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `AttributeError` and get Celery working with Flask. If any further issues arise, make sure to check the compatibility of all libraries and consult the documentation for any breaking changes or updates."
