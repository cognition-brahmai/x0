Specifically, in the context of the example class `FancyNewClass` derived from `collections.Iterable` where variant A uses `return iter(self._internal_iterable)` and variant B uses `yield from self._internal_iterable`. Is there a reason to prefer one over the other?"

        "content": "In Python, when you're rerouting the `__iter__` method to an underlying iterable, the difference between using `yield from iterable` and `return iter(iterable)` is significant in terms of functionality and behavior.\n\nLet's break down the two approaches:\n\n### 1. `return iter(self._internal_iterable)`\n\nHere, the `__iter__` method simply returns an iterator created from the internal iterable. This effectively makes the class an iterator factory, meaning that calling `iter(instance)` will produce a new iterator each time. This is straightforward and works well when you want to maintain the separation between the iterable object and the iterator it produces.\n\n### 2. `yield from self._internal_iterable`\n\nUsing `yield from` in the `__iter__` method makes the class itself an iterable that directly yields from the internal iterable. This means that the class instance becomes a generator object that can be iterated over. `yield from` not only simplifies the code by avoiding explicit loops but also handles propagation of values, exceptions, and the return value from the sub-generator.\n\n### Key Differences and Considerations\n\n1. **Generator Behavior**: Using `yield from` makes your class behave as a generator function. This means it can participate in generator-specific operations like `send()`, `throw()`, and `close()`, which are not applicable in the case of returning an iterator.\n\n2. **Reusability**: A generator (using `yield from`) can be exhausted after one complete iteration. If you attempt to iterate over it again, it will not yield any values unless you recreate the generator. On the other hand, `return iter(self._internal_iterable)` allows for multiple independent iterators to be created from the same iterable object.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: `yield from` can make the code simpler and more intuitive, especially when working with complex iterables or when you need to delegate iteration to another iterable.\n\n### Preference\n\n- If you need the class to simply provide an iterator each time it is iterated over, and you want to allow multiple independent iterators, `return iter(self._internal_iterable)` is the way to go.\n\n- If you want the class itself to behave like an iterable generator, potentially taking advantage of generator features, and you are okay with the class instance being exhausted after one complete iteration, then `yield from self._internal_iterable` is preferable.\n\nIn summary, the choice between the two depends on whether you want the class to behave more like a generator or an iterable that can produce multiple iterators."
