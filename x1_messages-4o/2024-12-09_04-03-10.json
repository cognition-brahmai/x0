Here is what I tried:\n\n```python\nimport peewee as pw\n\nmyDB = pw.MySQLDatabase(host=\"mydb.crhauek3cxfw.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com\",port=3306,user=\"user\",passwd=\"password\",db=\"mydb\")\n\nclass MySQLModel(Model):\n    \"\"\"A base model that will use our MySQL database\"\"\"\n    class Meta:\n        database = myDB\n\nclass User(MySQLModel):\n    username = CharField()\n\nmyDB.connect()\n```\n\nBut it hangs up on the second line, giving an error saying `__init__() takes at least 2 arguments (1 given)`. I am not sure why it is saying I'm only giving it one argument when I'm providing five. Can you please help me understand what I am missing?"

        "content": "The issue you are encountering is due to the way the `MySQLDatabase` class is being instantiated in your code. The error message `__init__() takes at least 2 arguments (1 given)` suggests that the parameters are not being passed correctly to the `MySQLDatabase` constructor.\n\nThe `MySQLDatabase` constructor expects keyword arguments for `host`, `port`, `user`, `password`, and `database` (note that `password` is the correct keyword instead of `passwd`). Here's how you can properly initialize your database:\n\n```python\nimport peewee as pw\n\nmyDB = pw.MySQLDatabase(\n    'mydb',  # the database name\n    user='user',\n    password='password',\n    host='mydb.crhauek3cxfw.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com',\n    port=3306\n)\n\nclass MySQLModel(pw.Model):\n    \"\"\"A base model that will use our MySQL database\"\"\"\n    class Meta:\n        database = myDB\n\nclass User(MySQLModel):\n    username = pw.CharField()\n\nmyDB.connect()\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Database Name:** The first argument to `MySQLDatabase` should be the name of the database, not a keyword argument.\n2. **Password:** Use `password` as the keyword argument instead of `passwd`.\n3. **Model Class Import**: Make sure to import the `Model` class from peewee using `pw.Model`.\n4. **CharField Import**: Use `pw.CharField()` to ensure it is recognized as a field type in the Peewee library.\n\nMake sure that your RDS instance allows connections from your current IP address, and the user credentials are correct. You may also want to ensure that the necessary drivers for MySQL (such as `PyMySQL`) are installed in your environment, as Peewee relies on them to connect to MySQL databases. You can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install pymysql\n```\n\nBy making these adjustments, your script should connect to the MySQL database hosted on Amazon RDS without any issues."
