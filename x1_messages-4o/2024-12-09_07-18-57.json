Is there a Python package that contains an implementation of this function without requiring any external dependencies? I found an implementation on sourceforge at this URL: http://pylab.sourceforge.net/packages/included_functions.html, but it seems to be part of a much larger package and it's not clear which one."

        "content": "You can use the `math` module in Python, which includes an implementation of the error function, `erf`, without requiring any external dependencies. This is available in Python version 3.2 and later. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Example usage\nx = 1.0\nresult = math.erf(x)\nprint(f\"The error function erf({x}) is {result}\")\n```\n\nIf you're using a version of Python prior to 3.2, you might want to consider using the `scipy.special` module, which also provides the `erf` function. However, this would require installing the `scipy` library as an external dependency. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.special import erf\n\n# Example usage\nx = 1.0\nresult = erf(x)\nprint(f\"The error function erf({x}) is {result}\")\n```\n\nUsing the built-in `math` module is the simplest way to access the `erf` function without any additional dependencies."
