I've attempted to install it using both `pip` and the `setup.py` file but both methods are returning an error stating that `h5py.h` is not found. I have Numpy version 1.8.1 installed, which is above the minimum required version of 1.6. What could be the cause of this issue and how can I resolve it? Here is the complete output:\n\n```\nvan@Hulk:~/h5py-2.3.1\u27eb sudo python setup.py install\nlibhdf5.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\nHDF5 autodetection failed; building for 1.8.4+\nrunning install\nrunning bdist_egg\n...\nIn file included from h5py/defs.c:342:0:\nh5py/api_compat.h:27:18: fatal error: hdf5.h: No such file or directory\n #include \"hdf5.h\"\n                  ^\ncompilation terminated.\nerror: command 'x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc' failed with exit status 1\n```"

        "content": "The error message indicates that your system is missing the HDF5 development libraries, which are necessary to compile h5py. The `hdf5.h` header file is part of these development libraries. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Install the HDF5 Development Libraries**: You need to install the HDF5 development package, which includes the necessary headers and libraries. You can do this using the package manager:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify Installation**: After installation, verify that the library files are present. Typically, `hdf5.h` should be located in `/usr/include/hdf5/serial/`.\n\n3. **Reinstall h5py**: Once the HDF5 development libraries are installed, you can attempt to install h5py again. It's usually best to use `pip` because it manages dependencies well:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install h5py\n   ```\n\n   If you're using a virtual environment, make sure it's activated before running the `pip` command.\n\n4. **Environment Variables (if needed)**: If you still encounter issues, you might need to set `HDF5_DIR` to point to the directory where HDF5 is installed:\n\n   ```bash\n   export HDF5_DIR=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/hdf5/serial\n   ```\n\n5. **Clean Previous Build Artifacts**: If you previously attempted a build that failed, it might help to clean any build artifacts before attempting a new installation:\n\n   ```bash\n   python setup.py clean\n   ```\n\n6. **Check `gcc` and `g++`**: Ensure that you have a proper C/C++ compiler installed, as it's required to compile the extension:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install build-essential\n   ```\n\nAfter performing these steps, try installing h5py again. If you encounter further errors, please provide the error messages for additional troubleshooting."
