I have a dataframe 'df' with categorical variables 'cat_var_1' and 'cat_var_2' and a numerical variable 'num_var_1'. The 'cat_var_1' has possible values of 'Orange' and 'Banana' with ratios 0.6 and 0.4 respectively. The 'cat_var_2' has possible values of 'Monkey', 'Cat', and 'Dog' with ratios 0.2, 0.7, and 0.1 respectively. How can I split the data into training, test, and validation sets (60:20:20 split) such that these ratios are preserved as closely as possible? I have looked into the StratifiedKFold method from sklearn but it only evaluates on the basis of one categorical variable. Also, could you provide the complexity of the solution?"

        "content": "To perform stratified K-fold splitting while considering multiple categorical variables, you'll need to take a slightly different approach since the standard `StratifiedKFold` from scikit-learn only handles one categorical variable at a time. Here's a method to achieve this:\n\n### Approach:\n\n1. **Combine Categorical Variables**: Create a new feature that combines your categorical variables into a single feature. This can be done by concatenating the categorical values as strings.\n\n2. **Stratified Splitting**: Use `StratifiedKFold` or `StratifiedShuffleSplit` on this combined feature to ensure the stratification is based on both categorical variables.\n\n3. **Split the Data**: Perform the split into training, validation, and test sets based on the indices obtained from the stratified split.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedShuffleSplit\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'cat_var_1': ['Orange', 'Banana', 'Orange', 'Banana', 'Orange'],\n    'cat_var_2': ['Monkey', 'Cat', 'Dog', 'Cat', 'Monkey'],\n    'num_var_1': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Create a combined feature\ndf['combined'] = df['cat_var_1'] + '_' + df['cat_var_2']\n\n# Define stratified split\nstratified_split = StratifiedShuffleSplit(n_splits=1, test_size=0.4, random_state=42)\n\n# Splitting the data\nfor train_valid_index, test_index in stratified_split.split(df, df['combined']):\n    train_valid_set = df.iloc[train_valid_index]\n    test_set = df.iloc[test_index]\n\n# Further split the train_valid_set into train and validation sets\nstratified_split_valid = StratifiedShuffleSplit(n_splits=1, test_size=0.3333, random_state=42)\n\nfor train_index, valid_index in stratified_split_valid.split(train_valid_set, train_valid_set['combined']):\n    train_set = train_valid_set.iloc[train_index]\n    valid_set = train_valid_set.iloc[valid_index]\n\n# Display the splits\nprint(\"Train Set:\")\nprint(train_set)\nprint(\"\\nValidation Set:\")\nprint(valid_set)\nprint(\"\\nTest Set:\")\nprint(test_set)\n```\n\n### Complexity:\n\n- **Time Complexity**: The complexity of this method is mainly driven by the `StratifiedShuffleSplit`, which is \\(O(n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of samples in the dataset. The operation of combining categorical variables is \\(O(n)\\) as well.\n\n- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also \\(O(n)\\), as you need to store the indices of the splits and potentially the combined categorical feature.\n\nThis method ensures that the distribution of each combination of categorical variables is preserved across the train, validation, and test sets, adhering closely to the defined ratios."
