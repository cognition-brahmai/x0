Additionally, how can I incorporate an animated logo in the top-left corner that responds differently based on the time of day and weather conditions? For example, displaying an umbrella and offering weather updates if it's raining outside. Lastly, how can I add a search bar with advanced functionality in the top-right corner that allows users to search using voice commands and Boolean operators ('AND', 'OR', and 'NOT')? The AI should be able to understand natural language queries and return relevant results based on context and previous search history. Can you provide sample PHP code for these features? Remember, the goal is to create a UI that tests the reasoning and contextual understanding abilities of AI systems."

        "content": "To create a dynamic and interactive navigation menu with the specified features using PHP, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, you need to integrate several technologies and APIs. Here's a basic outline and sample code to get you started on each of these tasks:\n\n### 1. Navigation Menu with Icons\n\nTo have icons that require logical reasoning to decipher, you can use a set of abstract or symbolic icons. For this, you'll typically use a CSS framework like FontAwesome or Material Icons. Here\u2019s a simple example using FontAwesome:\n\n```php\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <title>Dynamic Navigation Menu</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0/css/all.min.css\">\n    <style>\n        body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; }\n        .menu { display: flex; list-style-type: none; }\n        .menu li { margin: 0 20px; cursor: pointer; }\n        .menu i { font-size: 24px; }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <ul class=\"menu\">\n        <li><i class=\"fas fa-box\"></i> Products</li>\n        <li><i class=\"fas fa-cogs\"></i> Services</li>\n        <li><i class=\"fas fa-book\"></i> Resources</li>\n        <li><i class=\"fas fa-user-circle\"></i> Account</li>\n        <li><i class=\"fas fa-life-ring\"></i> Support</li>\n        <li><i class=\"fas fa-question-circle\"></i> Help</li>\n    </ul>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### 2. Animated Logo Based on Time and Weather\n\nFor this, you'll need to use JavaScript to access time and weather data, possibly using a weather API like OpenWeatherMap. Then, you can use CSS animations for the logo.\n\n```html\n<head>\n    <!-- Add this in the head -->\n    <style>\n        #logo { width: 50px; height: 50px; transition: transform 1s; }\n        #logo.raining { background: url('umbrella.png'); transform: rotate(360deg); }\n        /* Add more styles for other conditions */\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div id=\"logo\" class=\"logo\"></div>\n    <script>\n        async function updateLogo() {\n            const response = await fetch('https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=YourCity&appid=YourAPIKey');\n            const data = await response.json();\n            const weather = data.weather[0].main.toLowerCase();\n            const logo = document.getElementById('logo');\n            \n            if (weather.includes('rain')) {\n                logo.className = 'raining';\n                // Add more conditions as needed\n            }\n            // Time-based changes\n            const hour = new Date().getHours();\n            if (hour < 6 || hour > 18) {\n                // Night-time conditions\n            }\n        }\n        updateLogo();\n    </script>\n</body>\n```\n\n### 3. Search Bar with Voice Command and Boolean Operators\n\nFor this, you can use the Web Speech API for voice input and a simple algorithm for parsing Boolean logic.\n\n```html\n<body>\n    <input type=\"text\" id=\"search-bar\" placeholder=\"Search...\">\n    <button onclick=\"startDictation()\">\ud83c\udfa4</button>\n    <div id=\"results\"></div>\n\n    <script>\n        function startDictation() {\n            if (window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition) {\n                const recognition = new (window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition)();\n                recognition.onresult = function(event) {\n                    const searchQuery = event.results[0][0].transcript;\n                    document.getElementById('search-bar').value = searchQuery;\n                    performSearch(searchQuery);\n                };\n                recognition.start();\n            } else {\n                alert(\"Your browser doesn't support speech recognition.\");\n            }\n        }\n\n        function performSearch(query) {\n            // Simple Boolean logic parsing\n            const terms = query.split(' ');\n            let results = []; // Fetch and filter your data based on terms and logic\n            document.getElementById('results').innerHTML = `Results for: ${query}`; // Real implementation would show actual results\n        }\n    </script>\n</body>\n```\n\n### Summary\n\nThis implementation touches upon the required features. Each feature would require more detailed integration based on your specific needs, data sources, and design preferences. You should also consider error handling, API limits, and fallback mechanisms for different environments. This code is a starting point and would need to be expanded and refined for a production environment."
