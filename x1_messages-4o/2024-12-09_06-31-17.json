        "content": "Certainly! If Jupyter is not detecting an environment variable set in your `.bashrc` file, it could be due to a few reasons, such as the variable not being exported properly or Jupyter not being launched from a session where the `.bashrc` file is sourced. Here are a few steps you can follow to address this issue:\n\n### Option 1: Export the Variable in `.bashrc`\n\n1. **Ensure the variable is exported**: Make sure your variable in the `.bashrc` file is exported. For example:\n   ```bash\n   export MY_VARIABLE=value\n   ```\n\n2. **Source `.bashrc`**: Open a terminal, and run the following command to source the `.bashrc` file:\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bashrc\n   ```\n\n3. **Start Jupyter from the terminal**: To ensure the environment variables are available, start Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab from the terminal:\n   ```bash\n   jupyter notebook\n   ```\n   or\n   ```bash\n   jupyter lab\n   ```\n\n### Option 2: Set Environment Variables in Jupyter\n\nIf you want to set the environment variable directly within Jupyter, you can do so within your notebook:\n\n1. **Use the `os` module**:\n   ```python\n   import os\n\n   os.environ['MY_VARIABLE'] = 'value'\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify the variable**:\n   ```python\n   print(os.environ.get('MY_VARIABLE'))\n   ```\n\n### Option 3: Modify Jupyter Configuration\n\nFor a more permanent solution, you can modify Jupyter's configuration to include the environment variable:\n\n1. **Create or edit `jupyter_notebook_config.py`**:\n   - Find the location of your Jupyter configuration directory:\n     ```bash\n     jupyter --config-dir\n     ```\n   - Open or create the `jupyter_notebook_config.py` file in this directory.\n\n2. **Add the environment variable**:\n   ```python\n   c = get_config()\n   import os\n   os.environ['MY_VARIABLE'] = 'value'\n   ```\n\n3. **Restart Jupyter**: Save the changes and restart your Jupyter server.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to access your environment variables within Jupyter. If you continue to experience issues, double-check the syntax and ensure Jupyter is being launched in a session where the environment variables are properly set."
