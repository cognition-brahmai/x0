The pattern could also be repeated until the end of the string, but the string could also end in the middle of the pattern. For example, with the string \"blablabla\", the output should be (bla, 3) and for \"rablabla\", the output should be (bla, 2). Also, for \"testblblblblb\", the output should be (\"bl\",4)."

        "content": "Detecting repeated patterns in a string without a specific pattern or length can be a bit challenging. However, you can use a systematic approach to find the longest repeating pattern in a string. Here's a Python function that attempts to find the longest repeating substring pattern and its count:\n\n```python\ndef find_repeated_pattern(s):\n    n = len(s)\n\n    # Function to find the longest repeating pattern\n    def find_pattern_length(s):\n        for length in range(1, n // 2 + 1):\n            # Check if the string can be divided into equal parts of 'length'\n            if n % length == 0:\n                pattern = s[:length]\n                # Check if repeating this pattern forms the original string\n                if pattern * (n // length) == s:\n                    return pattern, n // length\n            else:\n                # Check for incomplete repetition at the end\n                pattern = s[:length]\n                repetitions = s.count(pattern)\n                if pattern * repetitions == s[:repetitions * length]:\n                    return pattern, repetitions\n        return None, 1\n\n    max_pattern = \"\"\n    max_count = 0\n\n    # Try to find the longest repeating pattern\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):\n            pattern, count = find_pattern_length(s[i:j])\n            if count > 1 and len(pattern) > len(max_pattern):\n                max_pattern = pattern\n                max_count = count\n\n    return (max_pattern, max_count)\n\n# Example usage\nprint(find_repeated_pattern(\"blablabla\"))    # Output: ('bla', 3)\nprint(find_repeated_pattern(\"rablabla\"))     # Output: ('bla', 2)\nprint(find_repeated_pattern(\"testblblblblb\")) # Output: ('bl', 4)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Iterate through possible lengths:** The function `find_pattern_length` checks different lengths of substrings to determine if they can form repeating patterns.\n\n2. **Check for complete and incomplete repetitions:** It first checks if the string can be perfectly divided into equal parts. If not, it checks for the longest repeating pattern that can form the initial part of the string.\n\n3. **Keep track of the longest pattern:** The main loop updates the longest found pattern and its count.\n\nThis approach uses nested loops to explore potential patterns, so it may not be the most efficient for very large strings, but it should work well for typical use cases."
