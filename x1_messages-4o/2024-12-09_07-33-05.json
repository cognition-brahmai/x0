Here is the method I am using to connect and insert records into the database:\n\n```python\ndb = MySQLdb.connect(\"localhost\",\"root\",\"padmaramulu\",\"pdfsearch\" )\ncursor = db.cursor()\n#cursor.execute(\"\"\"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS documents (docid INT NOT NULL ,PRIMARY KEY(docid),docname CHAR(30)) engine=innodb\"\"\")\ntemp = \"hello\";number = 2;\ncursor.execute( 'insert into documents(docid,docname) values(\"%d\",\"%s\")' % (number,temp) )\ndb.close()\n```\n\nCan someone help me understand why I am unable to insert records into the database?"

        "content": "There are a few potential issues in your code that could prevent records from being inserted into the database. Let's go through them step-by-step:\n\n1. **Uncommitted Transaction:** After executing an `INSERT` statement, you need to commit the transaction to save the changes to the database. MySQL doesn't automatically commit transactions for `INSERT` operations unless you are in autocommit mode. You can do this by adding `db.commit()` before closing the connection. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n    ```python\n    db = MySQLdb.connect(\"localhost\", \"root\", \"padmaramulu\", \"pdfsearch\")\n    cursor = db.cursor()\n    # cursor.execute(\"\"\"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS documents (docid INT NOT NULL ,PRIMARY KEY(docid),docname CHAR(30)) engine=innodb\"\"\")\n    temp = \"hello\"\n    number = 2\n    cursor.execute('INSERT INTO documents(docid, docname) VALUES(%s, %s)', (number, temp))\n    db.commit()  # Commit the transaction\n    db.close()\n    ```\n\n2. **SQL Injection Vulnerability:** Your code is currently susceptible to SQL injection due to the use of string interpolation with `%`. It's better to use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. MySQLdb (or its successor `mysqlclient`) supports this with the `%s` placeholder.\n\n3. **Table and Database Issues:** Ensure that the `documents` table exists in your `pdfsearch` database, and that it has the correct structure. The `CREATE TABLE` statement is commented out, so make sure that the table has been created with the appropriate columns and data types.\n\n4. **Error Handling:** Implement error handling to catch and understand any exceptions that occur. This will help you determine the exact cause of the issue. You can do this by using a `try-except` block.\n\n    ```python\n    try:\n        db = MySQLdb.connect(\"localhost\", \"root\", \"padmaramulu\", \"pdfsearch\")\n        cursor = db.cursor()\n        temp = \"hello\"\n        number = 2\n        cursor.execute('INSERT INTO documents(docid, docname) VALUES(%s, %s)', (number, temp))\n        db.commit()\n    except MySQLdb.Error as e:\n        print(f\"Error inserting data: {e}\")\n    finally:\n        db.close()\n    ```\n\nBy implementing these changes, you should be able to successfully insert records into your MySQL database. If the problem persists, checking for exceptions or error messages will provide more insight into the underlying issue."
