When I plot this data using matplotlib.pyplot, sometimes the Y-axis is scaled in a way that labels are offset of the data instead of the actual data. This happens inconsistently, sometimes the Y-axis is labeled correctly and sometimes it isn't. The inconsistency seems to occur depending on the data range. How can I consistently get the Y-axis to be labeled as the data, not an offset of the data?\n\nHere's the data I have:\n\n```python\narray([ 4.312,  4.317,  4.316,  4.32 ,  4.316,  4.316,  4.319,  4.317,\n    4.317,  4.316,  4.318,  4.316,  4.318,  4.316,  4.318,  4.317,\n    4.317,  4.317,  4.316,  4.317,  4.318,  4.316,  4.318,  4.316,\n    4.318,  4.316,  4.317,  4.317,  4.318,  4.316,  4.317,  4.317,\n    4.317,  4.317,  4.317,  4.316,  4.319,  4.315,  4.319,  4.315,\n    4.319,  4.315,  4.316,  4.319,  4.317,  4.317,  4.317,  4.318,\n    4.315,  4.317,  4.317,  4.317,  4.319,  4.314,  4.32 ,  4.315,\n    4.317,  4.318,  4.315,  4.318,  4.317,  4.317,  4.317,  4.316,\n    4.317,  4.318,  4.317,  4.317,  4.317,  4.315,  4.319,  4.317,\n    4.315,  4.319,  4.316,  4.318,  4.318,  4.315,  4.318,  4.317,\n    4.317,  4.321])\n```\n\nAnd here's how I plot it:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot( deltas ) \nplt.show()\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing with the Y-axis labels being offset can be attributed to how Matplotlib is automatically adjusting the axis limits and formatting, especially when dealing with small ranges of data. This can result in labels being displayed as offsets. To consistently display the Y-axis labels as the actual data values, you can manually set the Y-axis limits and format the ticks. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Disable Offset for Y-Axis Ticks**: Use `ScalarFormatter` to format the Y-axis ticks without offset.\n\n2. **Set Y-Axis Limits Manually**: Define the Y-axis limits to ensure they encompass your data range without relying on automatic scaling.\n\nHere's the modified code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nfrom matplotlib.ticker import ScalarFormatter\n\n# Assuming 'deltas' is your array of data\ndeltas = np.array([4.312, 4.317, 4.316, 4.32, 4.316, 4.316, 4.319, 4.317,\n                   4.317, 4.316, 4.318, 4.316, 4.318, 4.316, 4.318, 4.317,\n                   4.317, 4.317, 4.316, 4.317, 4.318, 4.316, 4.318, 4.316,\n                   4.318, 4.316, 4.317, 4.317, 4.318, 4.316, 4.317, 4.317,\n                   4.317, 4.317, 4.317, 4.316, 4.319, 4.315, 4.319, 4.315,\n                   4.319, 4.315, 4.316, 4.319, 4.317, 4.317, 4.317, 4.318,\n                   4.315, 4.317, 4.317, 4.317, 4.319, 4.314, 4.32, 4.315,\n                   4.317, 4.318, 4.315, 4.318, 4.317, 4.317, 4.317, 4.316,\n                   4.317, 4.318, 4.317, 4.317, 4.317, 4.315, 4.319, 4.317,\n                   4.315, 4.319, 4.316, 4.318, 4.318, 4.315, 4.318, 4.317,\n                   4.317, 4.321])\n\nplt.plot(deltas)\n\n# Disable offset on Y-axis\nax = plt.gca()\nax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(ScalarFormatter(useOffset=False))\n\n# Manually set Y-axis limits\ny_min = deltas.min() - 0.001  # A small buffer for better visualization\ny_max = deltas.max() + 0.001\nplt.ylim(y_min, y_max)\n\nplt.xlabel('Sample Index')\nplt.ylabel('Delta (usec)')\nplt.title('Plot of Delta Timestamps')\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **ScalarFormatter**: This ensures that the Y-axis labels are displayed without an offset.\n- **Y-axis Limits**: Setting `y_min` and `y_max` provides a small buffer around your data range, ensuring the plot is well-scaled to the data.\n\nThis approach should give you consistent Y-axis labeling, regardless of the specific range of your data."
