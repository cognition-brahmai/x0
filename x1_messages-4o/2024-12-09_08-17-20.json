Is there a way to convert the notebook to HTML without including the code?"

        "content": "Yes, you can export your IPython (Jupyter) notebook to an HTML file without including the code by using the `nbconvert` tool along with a custom template that hides the code cells. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Create a custom template:**\n\n   First, you'll need to create a custom Jinja2 template that specifies not to include code cells in the exported HTML. Create a new file named `hide_code.tpl` with the following content:\n\n   ```jinja2\n   {%- extends 'full.tpl' -%}\n\n   {% block input_group %}\n   {%- if 'hide_input' not in cell.metadata or cell.metadata.hide_input != true -%}\n   {{ super() }}\n   {%- endif -%}\n   {% endblock input_group %}\n   ```\n\n   Alternatively, you can use the simpler method of hiding all code by modifying all cells to have a metadata tag `hide_input`.\n\n2. **Modify your notebook metadata (optional):**\n\n   If you prefer to control which cells to hide individually, you can add metadata to each cell you want to hide. Open your notebook, go to the cell you want to hide, click on \"View\" -> \"Cell Toolbar\" -> \"Edit Metadata,\" and add the following JSON:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"hide_input\": true\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Do this for every cell whose input you want to hide. If you want to hide all code cells without modifying metadata, you can skip this step.\n\n3. **Convert the notebook using nbconvert with the custom template:**\n\n   Run the following command to convert your notebook to HTML using the custom template:\n\n   ```bash\n   jupyter nbconvert --to html --template hide_code.tpl notebook.ipynb\n   ```\n\nThis will generate an HTML file with the code cells hidden while keeping the figures and text. You can further customize the template if needed to fit your specific requirements."
