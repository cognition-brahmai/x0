When I run `python manage.py runserver` on the server, I get the following error:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"manage.py\", line 10, in &lt;module&gt;\n    execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/core/management/__init__.py\", line 351, in execute_from_command_line\n    utility.execute()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/core/management/__init__.py\", line 343, in execute\n    self.fetch_command(subcommand).run_from_argv(self.argv)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/core/management/__init__.py\", line 177, in fetch_command\n    commands = get_commands()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/utils/lru_cache.py\", line 101, in wrapper\n    result = user_function(*args, **kwds)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/core/management/__init__.py\", line 72, in get_commands\n    for app_config in reversed(list(apps.get_app_configs())):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/apps/registry.py\", line 137, in get_app_configs\n    self.check_apps_ready()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/apps/registry.py\", line 124, in check_apps_ready\n    raise AppRegistryNotReady(\"Apps aren't loaded yet.\")\ndjango.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.\n```\n\nThe Django version on the server is 1.8.5, and locally it's 1.8.1. I suspect the version difference might be causing this issue. I also suspect there might be an issue with my `wsgi.py` and `manage.py` files. Could anyone provide some guidance on this?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error message you're encountering, `AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet`, is often related to issues with the Django app registry, which can be influenced by several factors. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Django Version Compatibility:**\n   Although the version difference between 1.8.1 and 1.8.5 is minor, it's a good idea to ensure version consistency across all environments. Update your local Django version to match the server version or vice versa using:\n   ```bash\n   pip install Django==1.8.5\n   ```\n\n2. **Inspect `manage.py`:**\n   Ensure your `manage.py` file is correctly setting up the Django environment. Specifically, check that it has the following lines and that the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is correctly pointing to your settings file:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   import sys\n\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       os.environ.setdefault(\"DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\", \"your_project_name.settings\")\n       from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line\n       execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)\n   ```\n\n3. **Inspect `wsgi.py`:**\n   Ensure that `wsgi.py` correctly points to your Django settings. It should look similar to this:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application\n\n   os.environ.setdefault(\"DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\", \"your_project_name.settings\")\n   application = get_wsgi_application()\n   ```\n\n4. **Database Migrations:**\n   Ensure that all database migrations are up to date. Run the following commands on your server:\n\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py makemigrations\n   python manage.py migrate\n   ```\n\n5. **Check Installed Apps:**\n   Review your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting in your `settings.py` file to ensure all apps are correctly listed and accessible.\n\n6. **Check for Circular Imports:**\n   Circular imports can cause the app registry to not load properly. Inspect your project for any circular import dependencies.\n\n7. **Reinstall Dependencies:**\n   If the above steps don't resolve the issue, consider reinstalling your project's dependencies. Use a fresh virtual environment to avoid any conflicts:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n8. **Debug with a Shell:**\n   Run Django shell to see if it starts without issues. This can sometimes give more insight into what's going wrong:\n\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py shell\n   ```\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, try running your Django app in a different environment or server setup to isolate whether the problem is with the server configuration."
