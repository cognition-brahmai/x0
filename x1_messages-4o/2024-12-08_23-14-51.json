        "content": "The U.S. Constitution establishes a federal system of government where power is divided between the national government and the states. The role of the states under the Constitution includes:\n\n1. **Sovereignty and Powers**: States retain significant sovereignty and have powers not expressly delegated to the federal government by the Constitution. The Tenth Amendment reinforces this by stating that powers not granted to the federal government nor prohibited to the states are reserved to the states or the people.\n\n2. **Representation**: States are integral to the federal legislative process. Each state is represented in Congress, with two Senators per state in the Senate and Representatives in the House based on population.\n\n3. **Elections**: States are responsible for conducting elections, including federal elections, which gives them substantial influence over the electoral process.\n\n4. **Amendment Process**: States play a crucial role in the constitutional amendment process. An amendment can be ratified only with the approval of three-fourths of the state legislatures or conventions in three-fourths of the states.\n\n5. **Interstate Relations**: The Constitution outlines how states interact with each other, including the Full Faith and Credit Clause, which requires states to respect the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state.\n\n6. **Limitations**: The Constitution also places certain limitations on state powers, such as prohibiting states from entering into treaties, coining money, or passing laws that impair contracts.\n\nOverall, the states have a vital role in the federal system, balancing power with the national government and ensuring a distribution of authority that is responsive to local needs and priorities."
