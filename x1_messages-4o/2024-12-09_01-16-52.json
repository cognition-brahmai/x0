I have already successfully installed the NVIDIA driver (367.27) and CUDA toolkit (7.5). However, when I try to test with theano GPU implementation, I get an error saying \"nvcc fatal : Value 'sm_61' is not defined for option 'gpu-architecture'\". This occurs, for instance, when I'm importing theano with GPU enabled. I'm fairly new to Ubuntu and GPU programming, so could someone help me understand how I can resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to compatibility issues between the CUDA toolkit version you have installed and the compute capability of your GeForce GTX 1080 GPU. The GTX 1080 has a compute capability of 6.1, which is not supported by CUDA toolkit 7.5.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Update the CUDA Toolkit**: You should install a version of the CUDA toolkit that supports compute capability 6.1. CUDA 8.0 or later should work fine for your GTX 1080. You can download the latest version of the CUDA toolkit from the [NVIDIA Developer website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit).\n\n2. **Install a Compatible Version of cuDNN**: Along with updating CUDA, ensure you install a compatible version of cuDNN (NVIDIA\u2019s deep neural network library) as well. Typically, the cuDNN version should match the CUDA version you are using.\n\n3. **Update Theano Configuration**: Once you have installed the compatible CUDA toolkit and cuDNN, update your Theano configuration file (`.theanorc`), located in your home directory, with the appropriate flags to use the GPU. An example configuration might look like this:\n\n   ```ini\n   [global]\n   device = cuda\n   floatX = float32\n\n   [cuda]\n   root = /usr/local/cuda\n   ```\n\n4. **Check NVCC and PATH**: Ensure that the NVCC compiler from the new CUDA toolkit is in your PATH. You can check this by running `nvcc --version` in the terminal. It should show the version of CUDA you have just installed.\n\n5. **Verify the Setup**: Test your setup by running a simple Theano script that uses the GPU. You can also use the Theano test command to verify if everything is working correctly:\n\n   ```bash\n   THEANO_FLAGS='device=cuda,floatX=float32' python -c \"import theano; theano.test()\"\n   ```\n\n6. **Consider Using Conda**: If you face issues with dependencies, consider using Anaconda or Miniconda to manage your Python packages and environments. It can simplify managing different versions of libraries.\n\nBy updating your CUDA toolkit and ensuring all configurations are set properly, you should be able to resolve the error and utilize your GPU with Theano effectively."
