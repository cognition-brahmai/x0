For instance, is it more correct or better to use:\n\n```python\nclass TaggingMixin(models.Model):\n    tag = models.ForeignKey(Tag)\n\n    class Meta:\n        abstract = True\n\nclass MyModel(models.Model, TaggingMixin):\n    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n```\n\nOr this:\n\n```python\nclass TaggingMixin(object):\n    tag = models.ForeignKey(Tag)\n\n    class Meta:\n        abstract = True\n\nclass MyModel(models.Model, TaggingMixin):\n    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n```\n\nI am inclined to think that inheriting from object is the right way, but I am seeing examples of the first case all over the internet. Which is the most appropriate approach?"

        "content": "When designing mixins for Django models, the choice of inheritance depends on the specific functionality you want to achieve with the mixin. Let's break down the two approaches you mentioned:\n\n### 1. Inheriting from `models.Model`:\n\n```python\nclass TaggingMixin(models.Model):\n    tag = models.ForeignKey(Tag)\n\n    class Meta:\n        abstract = True\n```\n\n- **Use Case**: Inheriting from `models.Model` and declaring the mixin as `abstract = True` in its `Meta` class is appropriate when your mixin needs to include database fields. This is because a Django model requires fields to be part of a model class, and the abstract model allows you to define fields without creating a separate database table for the mixin itself.\n  \n- **When to Use**: Use this approach when the mixin is specifically for models and you need to add fields or methods that are directly related to database operations.\n\n### 2. Inheriting from `object`:\n\n```python\nclass TaggingMixin(object):\n    # tag = models.ForeignKey(Tag) # This wouldn't work here\n```\n\n- **Use Case**: This approach is more appropriate for pure Python mixins that do not need to interact directly with Django's ORM or database fields. It is useful for adding behavior (methods) to classes without requiring them to be part of the Django model system.\n\n- **When to Use**: Use this approach when the mixin is independent of the Django ORM, such as when you want to add utility methods or shared functionality that doesn't involve database fields.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn your specific example, since `tag` is a `ForeignKey` field, you should use the first approach, inheriting from `models.Model` with `abstract = True`. This allows the mixin to properly define model fields and integrate with Django's ORM. The second approach, inheriting from `object`, would not work correctly for defining model fields because it doesn't provide the necessary hooks into the Django ORM system.\n\nSo, the widespread examples you see of the first approach are generally more appropriate for Django model mixins that involve database fields."
