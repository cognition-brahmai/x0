For example, in my list of pairs, I have elements like (\"a\", 1), (\"b\", 2), (\"c\", 3). I can print each pair by iterating over the list, like this:\n\n```python\npairs = [(\"a\", 1), (\"b\", 2), (\"c\", 3)]\nfor x in pairs:\n    print x\n```\n\nThis gives me output like:\n\n```python\n('a', 1) ('b', 2) ('c', 3)\n```\n\nHowever, I'm looking for a way to access each element in each pair, similar to how you can in C++ using pair<string, int> and accessing them with x.first, and x.second. For example:\n\n```c++\nx = make_pair(\"a\",1)\nx.first= 'a'\nx.second= 1\n```\n\nHow can I achieve similar functionality in Python?"

Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\npairs = [(\"a\", 1), (\"b\", 2), (\"c\", 3)]\n\nfor first, second in pairs:\n    print(f\"First: {first}, Second: {second}\")\n```\n\nIn this code, `first` and `second` are used to unpack the values from each tuple in the `pairs` list. This is similar to accessing `x.first` and `x.second` in C++.\n\nThe output will be:\n\n```\nFirst: a, Second: 1\nFirst: b, Second: 2\nFirst: c, Second: 3\n```\n\nThis way, you can easily work with each element in the tuples individually."
