Below is an example of a Python script that uses basic string analysis to identify these emotions within the lyrics:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Load the JSON data\nwith open('song_data.json') as f:\n    song_data = json.load(f)\n\nlyrics = song_data['lyrics']\n\n# Function to analyze emotions in lyrics\ndef analyze_emotions(lyrics):\n    emotions = {\n        'longing': False,\n        'uncertainty': False,\n        'desire': False,\n        'dependence': False\n    }\n    \n    # Keywords for each emotion\n    longing_keywords = ['miss', 'gone', 'back', 'waiting']\n    uncertainty_keywords = ['if', 'unsure', 'doubt', 'maybe']\n    desire_keywords = ['want', 'need', 'crave', 'yearn']\n    dependence_keywords = ['rely', 'need', 'depend', 'hold']\n    \n    # Analyze lyrics\n    for line in lyrics.split('\\n'):\n        words = line.lower().split()\n        if any(keyword in words for keyword in longing_keywords):\n            emotions['longing'] = True\n        if any(keyword in words for keyword in uncertainty_keywords):\n            emotions['uncertainty'] = True\n        if any(keyword in words for keyword in desire_keywords):\n            emotions['desire'] = True\n        if any(keyword in words for keyword in dependence_keywords):\n            emotions['dependence'] = True\n\n    return emotions\n\n# Analyze the lyrics\nemotions_conveyed = analyze_emotions(lyrics)\n\n# Explanation of how the lyrics convey each emotion\nexplanation = {\n    'longing': \"The lyrics convey longing through expressions of missing someone or wishing for their return.\",\n    'uncertainty': \"Uncertainty is conveyed through questioning or expressing doubt about the future or feelings.\",\n    'desire': \"Desire is evident in the lyrics by expressing a strong need or want for someone or something.\",\n    'dependence': \"Dependence is shown through expressions of needing to rely on someone or the inability to be without them.\"\n}\n\n# Output the analysis\nprint(\"Emotions Conveyed in the Lyrics:\")\nfor emotion, present in emotions_conveyed.items():\n    if present:\n        print(f\"- {emotion.capitalize()}: {explanation[emotion]}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Longing:** The lyrics may include words or phrases that express a deep yearning or missing someone. This can be identified by keywords like \"miss\" or \"waiting.\"\n  \n- **Uncertainty:** This emotion is conveyed when the lyrics contain elements of doubt or indecision, often using words such as \"if,\" \"maybe,\" or \"unsure.\"\n\n- **Desire:** Desire is expressed through a strong want or need for something or someone, indicated by words like \"want,\" \"need,\" or \"crave.\"\n\n- **Dependence:** Dependence is shown when the lyrics speak about relying on someone or being unable to function properly without them, using terms like \"depend\" or \"need.\"\n\nThis script provides a basic analysis and may need adjustments based on the actual content of the lyrics. It identifies the presence of emotions through specific keywords and explains how each emotion is conveyed in the song."
