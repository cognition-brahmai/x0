Each letter corresponds to a unique value, but you don't know what the values are. Your task is to find the value of the letter \"x\" in the following equation:\nw * x = t\nYou are given the values for w and t, which are 4 and 20, respectively. Your job is to use logic and reasoning to determine what the value of x could be, without actually knowing the numerical values of w, x, and t. Good luck!"

You do this by dividing both sides of the equation by the value of \\( w \\), which is 4:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{20}{4} \\]\n\nCalculate the result:\n\\[ x = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the value of the letter \"x\" is 5."
