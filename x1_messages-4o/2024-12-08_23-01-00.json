The challenge here is to present the information in a way that requires reasoning to extract. For instance, you may display a table with the names of these scientists as headers and use a set of numbers as values that correspond to their respective fields of study and impact on modern science. You could further complicate the task by assigning a unique mathematical operation to each scientist, such that the sum or product of these operations results in the final output that displays their contributions. Can you take on this puzzle and showcase your skills as a PHP developer?"

If the result matches a predefined value (27 for multiplication and 12 for addition), the contribution is displayed.\n4. **Output**: The final contribution is displayed only if the calculated result meets the condition, demonstrating reasoning to extract the information. \n\nThis approach creatively encapsulates the data in a manner that requires logical processing to reveal the scientists' contributions."
