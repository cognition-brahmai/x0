I am trying to serve a file from `static/bootstrap` but I am getting an error. Here is the code I am using:\n\n```html\n<link rel=stylesheet type=text/css href=\"{{ url_for('static/bootstrap', filename='bootstrap.min.css') }}\">\n```\nHowever, I can reference files that are not in subfolders without any problems, as shown here:\n\n```html\n<link rel=stylesheet type=text/css href=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='bootstrap.min.css') }}\">\n```\n\nWhat is the correct way to reference static files with `url_for`? How can I use `url_for` to generate URLs to static files at any level?"

        "content": "The `url_for` function in Flask is designed to help generate URLs for different endpoints, including static files. When using `url_for` to reference static files, you should always specify `'static'` as the endpoint, regardless of the subfolder structure within the `static` directory. The `filename` parameter should include the relative path from the `static` folder to the specific file you are trying to serve.\n\nIn your case, if you want to reference a file located in `static/bootstrap`, you should include the subdirectory in the `filename` parameter like this:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='bootstrap/bootstrap.min.css') }}\">\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the correct usage:\n- `'static'` is the endpoint used to serve static files.\n- `filename='bootstrap/bootstrap.min.css'` includes the subdirectory `bootstrap` and the file name `bootstrap.min.css`.\n\nBy structuring the `filename` parameter in this way, Flask will correctly generate the URL to your static file located in the subdirectory."
