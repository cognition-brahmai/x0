Here's a simple example:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS customer_count\nFROM customers\nWHERE country = 'United States';\n```\n\nIn this query:\n\n- `COUNT(*)` is used to count the number of rows that match the condition specified in the `WHERE` clause.\n- The `WHERE` clause filters the rows to include only those where the `country` column is 'United States'.\n- The result will be a single row with a column named `customer_count` that holds the number of customers located in the United States."
