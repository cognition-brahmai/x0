Here are a couple of definitions:\n\n1. **Lacking a definite form**; having no specific shape; formless.\n2. **Of no particular kind or character**; indeterminate; having no pattern or structure; unorganized.\n3. **Chemistry**: Not crystalline; refers to substances that do not have the long-range order characteristic of a crystal.\n\nThe term is often used in various contexts, such as in scientific discussions to describe substances like glass or gel, which do not have a defined crystalline structure, or more broadly to describe concepts, ideas, or plans that are not well-defined or lacking clear boundaries."
