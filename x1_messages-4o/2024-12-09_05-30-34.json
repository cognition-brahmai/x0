I have been using the following NVIDIA-provided code which implements atomicAdd() for double. However, I want to understand why the implementation requires a loop, specifically the \"while (assumed!=old)\" loop. The code in question is:\n\n```cpp\n__device__ double atomicAdd(double* address, double val)\n{\n    unsigned long long int* address_as_ull =\n                                          (unsigned long long int*)address;\n    unsigned long long int old = *address_as_ull, assumed;\n    do {\n        assumed = old;\n        old = atomicCAS(address_as_ull, assumed, \n                        __double_as_longlong(val + \n                        __longlong_as_double(assumed)));\n    } while (assumed != old);\n    return __longlong_as_double(old);\n}\n```"

        "content": "The implementation of `atomicAdd` for `double` on CUDA devices involves a loop to ensure atomicity in updating the value at a particular memory address. Let's break down why this loop is necessary:\n\n1. **Atomicity Requirement**: The goal of this function is to perform an atomic addition, meaning the addition operation must be completed without interference from other threads. For types like `int` or `float`, CUDA provides built-in atomic operations. However, for `double`, which is typically 64 bits, there's no direct atomic operation. Hence, a loop is used to simulate atomic behavior.\n\n2. **CAS Loop**: The core of this implementation is the use of `atomicCAS` (Compare and Swap). This function attempts to update the value at `address_as_ull` only if it hasn't changed since it was last read. Here's how it works:\n   - **Read**: The current value is read into `old`.\n   - **Compute**: A new value is computed by adding `val` to the current value.\n   - **Attempt Update**: The `atomicCAS` function tries to update the value at `address_as_ull` to this new computed value, but only if it hasn't changed since it was last read.\n\n3. **Why the Loop?**: The loop is necessary because multiple threads might attempt to update the same memory location simultaneously. If another thread updates the value between the read and the `atomicCAS`, the `CAS` will fail (i.e., the value at `address_as_ull` will not equal `assumed`), and the operation will need to be retried:\n   - If `assumed != old`, another thread modified the value after it was initially read but before the `atomicCAS` could successfully update it. The function must then re-read the new value and attempt the addition again.\n\n4. **Convergence**: The loop will eventually exit once a thread successfully updates the value, meaning no other thread has altered the value between the read and the `CAS` operation.\n\nIn summary, the loop ensures that the `atomicAdd` operation is retried until it can be completed without interference from other threads, thus maintaining atomicity and data integrity."
