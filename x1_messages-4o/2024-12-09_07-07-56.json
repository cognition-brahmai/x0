I am not interested in knowing the specific shared elements or the number of shared elements, just whether they share an element or not. For instance, if L = [1,2,3,4,5,6] and M = [8,9,10], the result should be False as there are no common elements. But if L = [1,2,3,4,5,6] and M = [5,6,7], the result should be True as there are common elements."

        "content": "To determine if two lists share at least one common element in an efficient way, you can make use of Python's set data structure. By converting both lists to sets, you can take advantage of the intersection operation, which is efficient and straightforward for this task. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef have_common_element(list1, list2):\n    # Convert lists to sets\n    set1 = set(list1)\n    set2 = set(list2)\n    \n    # Check if there is any intersection\n    return not set1.isdisjoint(set2)\n\n# Example usage:\nL = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nM = [8, 9, 10]\nN = [5, 6, 7]\n\nprint(have_common_element(L, M))  # Output: False\nprint(have_common_element(L, N))  # Output: True\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Conversion to Sets**: Converting the lists to sets allows you to leverage set operations, which are optimized for performance. This is especially beneficial when working with large datasets.\n\n2. **isdisjoint() Method**: The `isdisjoint()` method is used to determine if two sets have no elements in common. It returns `True` if there are no common elements, and `False` otherwise. By negating its result with `not`, you get the desired boolean indicating shared elements.\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the two lists, making it efficient for checking intersection."
