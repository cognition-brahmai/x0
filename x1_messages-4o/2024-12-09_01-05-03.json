I have a Python 2.7 installation on my CentOS 5.5 server, installed in `/opt/python2.7.2` with a `site-packages` folder at `/opt/python2.7.2/lib/python2.7/site-packages`. I also have a third-party Python application which has added a `site-packages` folder at `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages` and installed itself there. I tried using `import sys; sys.path.insert(0, \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages\")` but this would require me to modify every script which is not ideal for future updates. To circumvent this, I have created a symbolic link in `/opt/python2.7.2/lib/python2.7/site-packages` to the location of this third-party application using the command `ln -sf /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/theapp /opt/python2.7.2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/theapp`. This seems to work but I am wondering if there is a better way to accomplish this?"

        "content": "To configure Python to recognize additional `site-packages` locations without modifying your scripts, you can use a couple of methods that are more maintainable and scalable than modifying the `sys.path` directly in each script or relying solely on symbolic links. Here are some approaches:\n\n1. **PYTHONPATH Environment Variable**:\n   - You can set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to include additional directories. This method is straightforward and doesn't require modifying your scripts or creating symbolic links.\n   - To set `PYTHONPATH`, you can add the following line to your shell's configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`):\n     ```bash\n     export PYTHONPATH=\"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH\"\n     ```\n   - This will ensure that Python automatically includes the specified directory when searching for packages.\n\n2. **.pth Files**:\n   - You can create a `.pth` file in your existing `site-packages` directory. This file can list additional directories that Python should include in its search path.\n   - Create a file, for example, `extra.pth`, in `/opt/python2.7.2/lib/python2.7/site-packages` with the following content:\n     ```\n     /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages\n     ```\n   - Each line in the `.pth` file should be a directory path that you want Python to include.\n\n3. **sitecustomize.py**:\n   - If you need more control or want to execute custom startup code, you can create a `sitecustomize.py` file in your `site-packages` directory.\n   - In `/opt/python2.7.2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sitecustomize.py`, add:\n     ```python\n     import sys\n     sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages')\n     ```\n   - This file will be automatically executed when the Python interpreter starts, modifying the `sys.path` before any scripts are run.\n\nThese methods are less intrusive and more manageable than modifying individual scripts or relying on symbolic links. Choose the one that best fits your needs and environment setup."
