I want to check if all the first characters of each word in the list are uppercase. If they are not, I want to print \"X is non conformant\". If they are, I want to print \"string is conformant\". For example, for the string \"Alpha_Beta_Gamma\", it should print \"string is conformant\"."

        "content": "To check if the first character of each word in a list is uppercase, you can iterate over the list and use the `str.isupper()` method for each first character. Here's a Python script that accomplishes what you described:\n\n```python\ndef check_conformance(words):\n    for word in words:\n        if not word[0].isupper():\n            print(f\"{word} is non conformant\")\n            return\n    print(\"string is conformant\")\n\n# Example usage\ninput_string = \"Alpha_beta_Gamma\"\nwords_list = input_string.split('_')\ncheck_conformance(words_list)\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `check_conformance` which takes a list of words as input. It iterates over each word in the list, checks if the first character is uppercase, and prints the appropriate message based on the check. If any word's first character is not uppercase, it prints that the word is non-conformant and exits. If all words pass the check, it prints that the string is conformant."
