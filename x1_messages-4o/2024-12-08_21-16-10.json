The sales data is stored in a table named \"sales\" with columns \"salesperson\", \"product\", \"quantity\", and \"date\". The date column is in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD\". The query should only consider sales made in the specified month and should return the salesperson's name and the total number of products sold. Can you provide the SQL code for this query?"

        "content": "Certainly! To find the total number of products sold by each salesperson in a given month, you can use the following SQL query. This query assumes that you will replace `YYYY-MM` with the specific year and month for which you want to retrieve the data.\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    salesperson, \n    SUM(quantity) AS total_products_sold\nFROM \n    sales\nWHERE \n    DATE_FORMAT(date, '%Y-%m') = 'YYYY-MM'\nGROUP BY \n    salesperson;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **SELECT clause**: We select the `salesperson` and use the `SUM` function to calculate the total quantity of products sold by each salesperson.\n\n2. **FROM clause**: We specify the table `sales` from which we want to retrieve the data.\n\n3. **WHERE clause**: We filter the records to include only those sales made in the specified month. The `DATE_FORMAT(date, '%Y-%m')` function extracts the year and month from the `date` column in the format 'YYYY-MM'. You should replace `'YYYY-MM'` with the desired year and month, e.g., `'2023-05'` for May 2023.\n\n4. **GROUP BY clause**: We group the results by `salesperson` to aggregate the sales data for each salesperson.\n\nThis query will return a list of salespersons along with the total number of products each sold in the specified month."
