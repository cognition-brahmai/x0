For example, I have code like this:\n\n```python\nmyLearnRate = 0.001\n...\noutput = tf.someDataFlowGraph\ntrainLoss = tf.losses.someLoss(output)\ntrainStep = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=myLearnRate).minimize(trainLoss)\nwith tf.Session() as session:\n    #first trainstep\n    session.run(trainStep, feed_dict = {input:someData, target:someTarget})\n    myLearnRate = myLearnRate * 0.1\n    #second trainstep\n    session.run(trainStep, feed_dict = {input:someData, target:someTarget})\n```\n\nIf I decrease the variable `myLearnRate` before the second `trainStep`, is this new learning rate applied when I run the second `trainStep` in my session? Is the node `trainStep` only evaluated once when it's created, or every time `session.run(train_step)` is called? How can I verify in the AdamOptimizer of tensorflow if the learning rate is actually changed?\n\nNote: I am aware that manually changing the learning rate is generally not recommended, and there is a similar question which suggests inputting a tensor as `learnRate` and updating it every `trainStep`. However, I am unsure if this method only works with a tensor as input for the learning rate in `AdamOptimizer` and I am not able to understand the logic behind it."

        "content": "In TensorFlow, when you set up an optimizer like `AdamOptimizer`, the learning rate is typically passed as a fixed value or as a placeholder/tensor. If you pass a fixed value (like your initial `myLearnRate`), the optimizer uses that value for all iterations unless you recreate the optimizer with a new learning rate.\n\nIn your code snippet, `trainStep` is created with the initial value of `myLearnRate`. As such, simply changing the `myLearnRate` variable in your Python code will not affect the already created `trainStep`. This is because the `trainStep` operation is already defined with the graph, and changing the Python variable doesn't alter the graph once it's created.\n\nTo dynamically adjust the learning rate, you should use a `tf.Variable` or a `tf.placeholder` to feed in the learning rate value. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Using `tf.Variable`\n1. Define the learning rate as a `tf.Variable`.\n2. Update the learning rate using TensorFlow operations.\n\n```python\nmyLearnRate = tf.Variable(0.001, trainable=False)\nupdate_lr = myLearnRate.assign(myLearnRate * 0.1)\n\noutput = tf.someDataFlowGraph\ntrainLoss = tf.losses.someLoss(output)\ntrainStep = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=myLearnRate).minimize(trainLoss)\n\nwith tf.Session() as session:\n    session.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())\n    # First trainstep\n    session.run(trainStep, feed_dict={input: someData, target: someTarget})\n\n    # Update learning rate\n    session.run(update_lr)\n\n    # Second trainstep\n    session.run(trainStep, feed_dict={input: someData, target: someTarget})\n```\n\n### Using `tf.placeholder`\n1. Define the learning rate as a `tf.placeholder`.\n2. Feed the learning rate value in each session run.\n\n```python\nmyLearnRate = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[])\ncurrent_lr = 0.001\n\noutput = tf.someDataFlowGraph\ntrainLoss = tf.losses.someLoss(output)\ntrainStep = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=myLearnRate).minimize(trainLoss)\n\nwith tf.Session() as session:\n    session.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())\n    # First trainstep\n    session.run(trainStep, feed_dict={input: someData, target: someTarget, myLearnRate: current_lr})\n\n    # Change learning rate\n    current_lr *= 0.1\n\n    # Second trainstep\n    session.run(trainStep, feed_dict={input: someData, target: someTarget, myLearnRate: current_lr})\n```\n\n### Verification\nTo verify if the learning rate has changed, you can print the value of the learning rate variable in the session using `session.run()` for the `tf.Variable` method or simply by checking the value passed into the `feed_dict` for the `tf.placeholder` method. For example:\n\n```python\nprint(session.run(myLearnRate))  # For `tf.Variable`\n```\n\nor\n\n```python\nprint(current_lr)  # For `tf.placeholder`\n```\n\nThis way, you can dynamically adjust the learning rate during training and verify that it's correctly applied."
