I have imported my original data table using pandas and it is defined as a dataframe. I need the final output to be a new table of the mean values. Here is an example of a short version of the table:\n\n```\na   b   c   d\n2   50  25  26\n4   11  38  44\n6   33  16  25\n8   37  27  25\n10  28  48  32\n12  47  35  45\n14  8   16  7\n16  12  16  30\n18  22  39  29\n20  9   15  47\n```\n\nand I expect to get a mean table like this:\n\n```\na    b     c     d\n3   30.5  31.5  35\n7   35    21.5  25\n11  37.5  41.5  38.5\n15  10    16    18.5\n19  15.5  27    38\n```"

        "content": "To calculate the mean values of every two rows for each column in a Pandas DataFrame, you can use the `groupby` method and the `mean` function. Here's a step-by-step guide with a code example:\n\n1. **Import the necessary libraries.**\n2. **Create your DataFrame (or use an existing one).**\n3. **Group the DataFrame by every two rows.**\n4. **Calculate the mean for each group.**\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample data\ndata = {\n    'a': [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20],\n    'b': [50, 11, 33, 37, 28, 47, 8, 12, 22, 9],\n    'c': [25, 38, 16, 27, 48, 35, 16, 16, 39, 15],\n    'd': [26, 44, 25, 25, 32, 45, 7, 30, 29, 47]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Group the DataFrame by every two rows and calculate the mean\nresult = df.groupby(df.index // 2).mean()\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`df.index // 2`**: This creates a new index for the DataFrame where every two rows are grouped under the same index. For example, rows 0 and 1 become group 0, rows 2 and 3 become group 1, and so on.\n- **`groupby(...).mean()`**: This groups the DataFrame based on the new index created and calculates the mean for each group.\n\nWhen you run the code, you should get the expected output with the mean values calculated for every two rows:\n\n```\n      a     b     c     d\n0   3.0  30.5  31.5  35.0\n1   7.0  35.0  21.5  25.0\n2  11.0  37.5  41.5  38.5\n3  15.0  10.0  16.0  18.5\n4  19.0  15.5  27.0  38.0\n```\n\nThis approach is efficient and works well even for larger data tables."
