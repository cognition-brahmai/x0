Therefore, you can use any one of these columns to calculate the surface area of a cube. The surface area \\(A\\) of a cube with side length \\(s\\) is given by:\n\n\\[ A = 6 \\times s^2 \\]\n\nAssuming each cube's dimensions are stored in the \"length\" column, your query would look like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT SUM(6 * length * length) AS surface_area_sum\nFROM cubes;\n```\n\nThis query calculates the surface area for each cube using the \"length\" as the side, squares it, multiplies by 6, and then sums up the surface areas for all the cubes in the table."
