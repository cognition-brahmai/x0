I am currently dealing with a skewed dataset where 1% of the labels are category A and 99% are category B. I am assigning A as the positive category and classifying all test items as positive, which results in a high F-1 score. Is there a way to tell scikit-learn which category is positive?"

        "content": "In scikit-learn, when you're dealing with binary classification and calculating metrics like the F1 score, you can specify which class is considered the positive class using the `pos_label` parameter. This is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets, as it allows you to focus on the minority class or the class of interest.\n\nHere's how you can specify the positive class when calculating the F1 score using scikit-learn:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.metrics import f1_score\n\n# Assume y_true and y_pred are your true labels and predicted labels, respectively\ny_true = [...]  # your true labels\ny_pred = [...]  # your predicted labels\n\n# Specify the positive class using the pos_label parameter\nf1 = f1_score(y_true, y_pred, pos_label='A')  # or pos_label=1 if A is represented by 1\n\nprint(\"F1 Score:\", f1)\n```\n\nIn this example, replace `'A'` with the label you are considering as the positive class. If your labels are numeric (e.g., 0 and 1), use `pos_label=1` if 1 is your positive class. This will ensure that the F1 score is computed with the specified positive class in mind, allowing you to assess the model's performance more accurately for that class."
