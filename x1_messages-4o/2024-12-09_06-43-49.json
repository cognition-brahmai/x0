I don't want to re-sort the array but to reverse the operations that were done during sorting. I think I need to use `argsort()`, but I'm not sure how to sort an array with the results of `argsort()` or apply the inverse of `argsort()`. \n\nTo give more context, the shape of array 'a' is rXc and I need to sort each column. After sorting the array, I calculated the mean of each row and replaced each column in a row with the row mean. Now, I want to undo the sort I did in the first step. How can I achieve this?\n\nHere is the code I've written so far:\n\n```python\naargsort = a.argsort(axis=0)  # May use this later\naSort = a.sort(axis=0)\n\n# Now average each row\naSortRM = aSort.mean(axis=1)\n\n# Replace each column in a row with the row mean.\naWithMeans = ones_like(a)\nfor ind in range(r):  # r = number of rows\n    aWithMeans[ind]* aSortRM[ind]\n```"

        "content": "To achieve the desired operation and then reverse it, you can use `argsort()` to obtain the indices that would sort your array, perform the operations, and then use these indices to unsort (or revert) your array back to its original order.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Use `argsort()` to get the indices that would sort each column.\n2. Use these indices to sort the array.\n3. Perform the required operations (like calculating the row means and replacing each column with the row mean).\n4. Use the indices obtained in step 1 to revert the sorted array back to its original order.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Sample array\na = np.random.rand(5, 3)\nr, c = a.shape\n\n# Step 1: Get the indices that would sort each column\na_argsort = a.argsort(axis=0)\n\n# Step 2: Sort the array using these indices\na_sorted = np.take_along_axis(a, a_argsort, axis=0)\n\n# Step 3: Perform operations - Calculate row means and replace each column with the row mean\na_row_means = a_sorted.mean(axis=1, keepdims=True)\na_with_means = np.tile(a_row_means, (1, c))\n\n# Step 4: Use the indices to revert the sort\n# To unsort, we need the inverse of the argsort\na_unsort_indices = np.argsort(a_argsort, axis=0)\na_original_order = np.take_along_axis(a_with_means, a_unsort_indices, axis=0)\n\nprint(\"Original array:\\n\", a)\nprint(\"Sorted array:\\n\", a_sorted)\nprint(\"Array with row means:\\n\", a_with_means)\nprint(\"Unsorted (reverted) array:\\n\", a_original_order)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Step 1**: `argsort` is used to get the indices that would sort the array along each column.\n- **Step 2**: `take_along_axis` is a handy function that sorts the array according to the indices from `argsort`.\n- **Step 3**: You calculate the mean of each row and replace each row's values with its mean.\n- **Step 4**: To reverse the sorting, `argsort` is again applied on `a_argsort` to obtain the indices that will return the array to its original order. Use `take_along_axis` to apply these indices and revert the array.\n\nThis should help you achieve your task of sorting, operating, and then unsorting the array."
