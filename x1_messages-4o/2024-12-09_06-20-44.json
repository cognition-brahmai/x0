I am interested in using the new Python 3.6 f-strings in my new projects which may be running on older interpreters. Ideally, I would like to have support for versions 2.7, 3.3-3.5, but at the very least, I would like to use these in Python 3.5 code bases. I am aware that formatted string literals like `f\"Foo is {age} {units} old\"` are not breaking changes, hence they would not be included in a `from __future__ import ...` call. Since this change is not back-ported, how can I ensure that the new code I write with f-strings will only run on Python 3.6 or higher versions?"

        "content": "Formatted string literals, or f-strings, were introduced in Python 3.6 and are not available in earlier versions of Python. Unfortunately, there is no way to directly import or backport this feature to older Python versions like 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, or 3.5. F-strings rely on syntax changes in the Python interpreter that aren't compatible with older versions, so they can't be used directly in those environments.\n\nHowever, if you want your code to run on Python 3.5 or earlier, you have a few options:\n\n1. **Use the `format()` Method**: Instead of using f-strings, you can use the `str.format()` method, which is available in Python 2.7 and onwards. For example, instead of writing `f\"Foo is {age} {units} old\"`, you can write `\"Foo is {} {} old\".format(age, units)`.\n\n2. **Template Strings**: The `string.Template` class can be used for simple string substitution and is available in Python 2.7 and 3.x.\n\n3. **Conditional Execution**: If you're targeting multiple Python versions, you can write your code to conditionally use f-strings only if the interpreter is 3.6 or higher. You can check the Python version at runtime using the `sys.version_info` attribute:\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n\n   if sys.version_info >= (3, 6):\n       # Use f-strings\n       result = f\"Foo is {age} {units} old\"\n   else:\n       # Use str.format()\n       result = \"Foo is {} {} old\".format(age, units)\n   ```\n\n4. **Static Code Transformation**: Use a tool that can automatically convert code with f-strings to code that uses the `format()` method or another compatible approach when deploying to older Python environments.\n\n5. **Specify Python Version Requirements**: If you can ensure your project will only run in environments where Python 3.6 or higher is available, you can specify this requirement in your project's documentation and configuration files (e.g., in `setup.py`, `Pipfile`, or `requirements.txt`).\n\nBy using these strategies, you can write code that is compatible with older Python versions while taking advantage of newer syntax in environments where it is supported."
