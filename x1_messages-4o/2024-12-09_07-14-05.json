I have two objects that represent the same event instance - one holds the date and the other the time of this event. However, I can't simply add date and time objects as the following call fails:\n\n```python\ndatetime.date(2011, 01, 01) + datetime.time(10, 23)\n```"

        "content": "To combine a `datetime.date` object and a `datetime.time` object into a single `datetime.datetime` object in Python, you can use the `datetime.combine()` method from the `datetime` module. This method takes a date and a time object and returns a combined `datetime` object.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import date, time, datetime\n\n# Create a date object\ndate_obj = date(2011, 1, 1)\n\n# Create a time object\ntime_obj = time(10, 23)\n\n# Combine date and time into a datetime object\ndatetime_obj = datetime.combine(date_obj, time_obj)\n\nprint(datetime_obj)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n2011-01-01 10:23:00\n```\n\nThis approach allows you to seamlessly combine the date and time components into a single `datetime` object, which can then be used for further operations or manipulations."
