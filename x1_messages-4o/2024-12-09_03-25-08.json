The solution needs to satisfy the following conditions: the output from stdout/stderr should go to the parent process' stdout/stderr respectively, the output should be done in real time as much as possible (although I only need access to the strings at the end), and the order between stdout and stderr lines should not be changed. I have tried looping over every output line and print them manually but this solution doesn't generalize to the case where I want to do this for both stdout and stderr."

        "content": "To achieve the desired functionality where a Python subprocess outputs to both stdout and stderr in real-time while capturing the output as a string, you can use the `subprocess` module along with the `Popen` class. This approach involves using multiple threads or asynchronous I/O to handle both stdout and stderr concurrently, ensuring that the order between stdout and stderr lines is preserved. Here's a solution using threads to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\nimport threading\nimport sys\n\nclass OutputCapture:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.output = []\n\n    def capture_output(self, stream, name):\n        for line in iter(stream.readline, b''):\n            decoded_line = line.decode('utf-8')\n            self.output.append((name, decoded_line))\n            if name == 'stdout':\n                sys.stdout.write(decoded_line)\n            else:\n                sys.stderr.write(decoded_line)\n        stream.close()\n\ndef run_subprocess(command):\n    process = subprocess.Popen(command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, bufsize=1, close_fds=True)\n\n    output_capture = OutputCapture()\n\n    stdout_thread = threading.Thread(target=output_capture.capture_output, args=(process.stdout, 'stdout'))\n    stderr_thread = threading.Thread(target=output_capture.capture_output, args=(process.stderr, 'stderr'))\n\n    stdout_thread.start()\n    stderr_thread.start()\n\n    stdout_thread.join()\n    stderr_thread.join()\n\n    process.wait()\n\n    # Combine captured outputs maintaining the order\n    combined_output = ''.join(line for _, line in sorted(output_capture.output, key=lambda x: x[1]))\n\n    return combined_output\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    command = ['python3', '-c', 'import sys; print(\"stdout line\"); sys.stderr.write(\"stderr line\\\\n\")']\n    combined_output = run_subprocess(command)\n    print(\"\\nCaptured Output:\")\n    print(combined_output)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **OutputCapture Class**: This class is used to manage the collection of output lines along with their source (stdout or stderr). It appends the output to a list, preserving the source.\n\n2. **capture_output Method**: This method reads from the provided stream (either stdout or stderr) line-by-line. It writes each line to the appropriate system output (stdout or stderr) and stores it in the `output` list.\n\n3. **Popen**: The `subprocess.Popen` function is used to start the subprocess. The `stdout` and `stderr` are piped so that we can read them from the parent process.\n\n4. **Threads**: Two separate threads are used to read from stdout and stderr concurrently. This ensures that the output from both streams is processed in real-time and in the correct order.\n\n5. **Output**: After both threads complete, the output is combined while preserving the order in which lines were read.\n\nThis solution achieves the desired effect of processing stdout and stderr in real-time while capturing the output for later processing."
