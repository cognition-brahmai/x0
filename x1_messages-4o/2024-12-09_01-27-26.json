I want to solve this by reading the file in chunks, processing each chunk, storing the processed chunk into another file, and then moving on to the next chunk. Is there a method in Python that allows me to yield these chunks in a lazy manner?"

        "content": "Yes, you can read a large file in chunks using Python by utilizing the concept of generators, which allow you to yield data lazily. This can be very efficient for processing large files as it avoids loading the entire file into memory at once. Below is an example of how you can achieve this using a generator function:\n\n```python\ndef read_in_chunks(file_object, chunk_size=1024):\n    \"\"\"Lazy function (generator) to read a file piece by piece.\n    Default chunk size: 1KB.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        data = file_object.read(chunk_size)\n        if not data:\n            break\n        yield data\n\n# Open your large file\ninput_file_path = 'large_file.txt'\noutput_file_path = 'processed_file.txt'\n\nwith open(input_file_path, 'rb') as file:\n    with open(output_file_path, 'wb') as output_file:\n        for chunk in read_in_chunks(file):\n            # Process the chunk (for example, convert to uppercase)\n            processed_chunk = chunk.upper()  # Example processing\n            # Write the processed chunk to the output file\n            output_file.write(processed_chunk)\n```\n\nIn this example, `read_in_chunks` is a generator function that reads the file in chunks of a specified size (default is 1KB). You can adjust the `chunk_size` parameter to a value that suits your system's memory constraints and processing requirements.\n\nThe `with` statement ensures that both the input and output files are properly closed after processing. The example also includes a simple processing step where each chunk is converted to uppercase before being written to the output file. You can replace this step with your own processing logic as needed."
