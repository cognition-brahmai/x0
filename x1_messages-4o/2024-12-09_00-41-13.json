Despite following instructions from the Django Static Link tutorial on handling static files, I am still encountering problems. My settings are as follows: \n```python\n# Absolute path to the directory static files should be collected to.\n# Don't put anything in this directory yourself; store your static files\n# in apps' \"static/\" subdirectories and in STATICFILES_DIRS.\n# Example: \"/home/media/media.lawrence.com/static/\"\nSTATIC_ROOT = '/Users/a9austin/Development/sites/AlphaSocks/src/static_root/'\n\n# URL prefix for static files.\n# Example: \"http://media.lawrence.com/static/\"\nSTATIC_URL = '/static/'\n\n# Additional locations of static files\nSTATICFILES_DIRS = (\n# Put strings here, like \"/home/html/static\" or \"C:/www/django/static\".\n# Always use forward slashes, even on Windows.\n# Don't forget to use absolute paths, not relative paths.\n'/Users/a9austin/Development/sites/AlphaSocks/src/staticfiles'\n)\n```\nIn my view, I am attempting to render an index page like so: \n```python\n#from django.http import HttpResponse\nfrom django.shortcuts import render_to_response\n\ndef index(request):\nreturn render_to_response('index.html')\n```\nMy index.html file contains a link to the CSS file as follows:\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{STATIC_URL}}css/style.css\" type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen\" >\n```\nMy directory organization is structured as `src->staticfiles->css->style.css`. Why is my static CSS file not working?"

        "content": "It looks like you're having trouble with serving static files in your Django application. Let's go through a few steps to ensure everything is set up correctly:\n\n1. **Check Your `STATICFILES_DIRS` Setting**: Your `STATICFILES_DIRS` is correctly pointing to the directory where your static files are located. Make sure that the path `/Users/a9austin/Development/sites/AlphaSocks/src/staticfiles` is correct and that it contains the `css` directory with the `style.css` file inside it.\n\n2. **Use `{% static %}` Template Tag**: In your `index.html`, you should use the `{% static %}` template tag to reference static files. This is a more reliable way to ensure Django correctly resolves the static file paths. Update your link tag as follows:\n\n    ```html\n    {% load static %}\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{% static 'css/style.css' %}\" type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen\" >\n    ```\n\n3. **Ensure `django.contrib.staticfiles` is Installed**: Make sure that `django.contrib.staticfiles` is included in your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting in your `settings.py`. This app is necessary for serving static files.\n\n4. **Development Server**: During development, Django automatically serves static files if `DEBUG` is set to `True`. Make sure `DEBUG = True` in your `settings.py`. This should not be the case in a production environment, but for development purposes, it's okay.\n\n5. **Collect Static (Production Only)**: In a production environment, you will need to run `python manage.py collectstatic` to collect all your static files into the `STATIC_ROOT` directory. However, during development, this step is not typically necessary unless you're testing your production setup.\n\n6. **File Permissions**: Ensure that the CSS file has the correct permissions and is readable by the server.\n\n7. **Restart Your Server**: Sometimes, changes don't take effect immediately. If you haven't already, try restarting your Django development server.\n\n8. **Console Errors**: Check your browser's console for any errors related to loading the CSS file. This might give you more insight into what's going wrong.\n\nBy following these steps, your static files should be served correctly. If you continue to experience issues, double-check the directory paths and ensure all configurations in `settings.py` are correct."
