        "content": "The error you're encountering indicates that the ODBC driver specified in your connection string is not found or is not installed on your machine. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify ODBC Driver Installation**:\n   - Ensure that the ODBC driver for SQL Server is installed on your system. You can check this by going to the \"ODBC Data Source Administrator\" tool on Windows.\n   - Look for \"SQL Server\" or \"ODBC Driver for SQL Server\" under the \"Drivers\" tab. If it's not listed, you'll need to download and install the appropriate driver.\n\n2. **Install the Correct ODBC Driver**:\n   - You can download ODBC drivers from the Microsoft website. The two most commonly used drivers are:\n     - Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server\n     - SQL Server Native Client\n\n3. **Modify the Connection String**:\n   - Make sure that your connection string matches the installed driver's name exactly. For example, if you have the \"ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server\" installed, your connection string should look like this:\n     ```python\n     connection = pyodbc.connect('Driver={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};'\n                                 'Server=SIWSQL43A\\\\SIMSSPROD43A;'\n                                 'Database=CSM_reporting;'\n                                 'Trusted_Connection=yes;')\n     ```\n   - Double backslashes (i.e., `\\\\`) are necessary in Python strings to properly escape the backslash character.\n\n4. **Check 32-bit vs 64-bit Compatibility**:\n   - Ensure that the Python interpreter and the ODBC driver are both either 32-bit or 64-bit. If your Python is 64-bit, then you need the 64-bit ODBC driver, and vice versa.\n\n5. **Server and Instance Name**:\n   - Double-check that the server and instance name are correct and accessible from your network environment. You can try connecting using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to verify this.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"Data source name not found and no default driver specified\" error and successfully establish a connection to your SQL Server using pyodbc."
