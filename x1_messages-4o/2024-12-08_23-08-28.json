        "content": "The data type of the value 25.09 is a floating-point number. In most programming languages like Python, this would typically be represented as a `float`.\n\nTo provide the bit representation of a floating-point number, we generally use the IEEE 754 standard, which is the most common way of representing floating-point numbers in computers. The standard specifies different formats, with the most common being the 32-bit \"single-precision\" and 64-bit \"double-precision\".\n\nFor a 64-bit double-precision floating-point representation:\n\n1. **Sign bit:** 1 bit for the sign (0 for positive, 1 for negative).\n2. **Exponent:** 11 bits for the exponent.\n3. **Mantissa (or significand):** 52 bits for the fraction.\n\nLet's convert 25.09 to its IEEE 754 double-precision binary representation:\n\n1. **Convert the integer part (25) to binary:** `11001`.\n2. **Convert the fractional part (.09) to binary:** This requires multiplying by 2 and taking the integer part repeatedly. It is a bit complex, but the binary approximation is approximately `0.000110011001100110011...`.\n\nWhen combined, the binary form of 25.09 is roughly `11001.000110011001100110...`.\n\n3. **Normalize the binary number:** This is done by shifting the binary point so that there's only one non-zero digit to the left of the point. For 25.09, it becomes `1.100100011001100110011... \u00d7 2^4`.\n\n4. **Calculate the exponent:** The unbiased exponent is 4 (from the normalization step). In IEEE 754, the exponent is stored with a bias of 1023. So, the stored exponent is `4 + 1023 = 1027`, which is `10000000011` in binary.\n\n5. **Form the mantissa:** The fractional part after the binary point in the normalized form is used to fill the mantissa bits: `100100011001100110011...` (truncated or rounded to fit 52 bits).\n\n6. **Combine the sign, exponent, and mantissa:** Sign bit is 0 (since it's positive), exponent is `10000000011`, and mantissa is the fractional part.\n\nThus, the double-precision IEEE 754 representation of 25.09 is approximately:\n```\n0 10000000011 1001000110011001100110011001100110011001100110011010\n```\n\nThis is a rather complex process, but it illustrates how floating-point numbers are stored in binary form."
