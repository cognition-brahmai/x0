Although I've successfully installed the flask_login module and am able to run a simple script from the command prompt without error, I'm having trouble with a more complex script. The script I'm trying to run is:\n\n```\nfrom flask import Flask\nfrom flask.ext.login import LoginManager\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route(\"/\")\ndef hello():\n    return \"Hello World! Welcome\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run()\n```\n\nWhen I run this script, I'm getting the error \"ImportError: No module named flask.ext.login\". I'm new to flask so I'm unsure what I'm doing wrong. Can you help me resolve this?"

        "content": "The \"ImportError: No module named flask.ext.login\" occurs because the import path for `flask.ext.login` is outdated. The `flask.ext` namespace was used in older versions of Flask to access extensions, but it has been deprecated. Instead, you should import `flask_login` directly. Here's how you can update your script:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\nfrom flask_login import LoginManager\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route(\"/\")\ndef hello():\n    return \"Hello World! Welcome\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run()\n```\n\nAdditionally, ensure that you have `flask_login` installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip if it's not already installed:\n\n```bash\npip install flask-login\n```\n\nAfter making these changes, your script should run without the ImportError. If you encounter any other issues, feel free to ask for more help!"
