I have changed the path and I can no longer run python application.py. The error I receive is \"ImportError: cannot import name md5\". I have already attempted the following steps:\n```\nLDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib\nCPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include\n```\nHowever, I still receive the ImportError. When I attempt to force link openssl with brew using the command `brew link --force openssl`, I receive a warning and multiple error messages indicating that the code for various hash types were not found. How can I resolve this issue to run my application?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "It looks like you're facing an issue with importing the `md5` function from the `hashlib` module in Python, which is standard and should not typically cause an import error. The error might be related to the environment configuration or your Python installation.\n\nHere are steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Python Version**: Ensure that you're using a compatible Python version. The `hashlib` module is available in Python 2.5 and later, with `md5` being available since then. You can check your Python version using:\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   ```\n\n2. **Use Hashlib Correctly**: The `md5` function should be accessed directly from `hashlib` like this:\n   ```python\n   import hashlib\n   md5_hash = hashlib.md5()\n   ```\n   If you are doing this and still encountering issues, the problem might be elsewhere.\n\n3. **Reinstall OpenSSL and Python**: If there are issues with OpenSSL, it might be worth reinstalling both OpenSSL and Python:\n   ```bash\n   brew uninstall openssl\n   brew install openssl\n   brew uninstall python\n   brew install python\n   ```\n\n4. **Correct Linking with Brew**: If you have issues with linking OpenSSL, ensure that your system recognizes the correct paths. You can try:\n   ```bash\n   brew link --force --overwrite openssl\n   ```\n\n5. **Environment Variables**: Set your environment variables to point to the correct OpenSSL paths. Add the following to your shell configuration file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.):\n   ```bash\n   export LDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib\"\n   export CPPFLAGS=\"-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include\"\n   export PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/openssl/bin:$PATH\"\n   ```\n\n6. **Virtual Environment**: Use a virtual environment to isolate your project's dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv venv\n   source venv/bin/activate\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n7. **Reinstall Python Packages**: If there's a potential corruption, reinstall your Python packages within the virtual environment:\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall -r requirements.txt\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n8. **Check for Conflicting Files**: Ensure there are no files named `hashlib.py` or directories named `hashlib` in your project, as these could shadow the standard library module.\n\nIf after these steps you're still encountering issues, it might be helpful to check the full stack trace of the error for additional context. Additionally, verify that no other libraries or packages are interfering with the `hashlib` module."
