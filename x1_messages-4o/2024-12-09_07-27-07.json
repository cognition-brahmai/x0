I've also tried to omit the argument altogether but that's giving me an \"invalid Syntax\" error. Is there an alternative way to achieve this? Here's what I've tried:\n\n```python\ndef f(a,_,_): return a\n...\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1\nSyntaxError: duplicate argument '_' in function definition\n```\n\n```python\ndef f(a,,): return a\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1\n    def f(a,,): return a\n        ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n```"

        "content": "In Python 2.x, you cannot use the same name for multiple arguments in a function definition, which is why you're encountering a \"duplicate argument\" error with underscores. Python requires each argument to have a unique name.\n\nIf you want to indicate that certain arguments are unused, you can use different variable names for each unused argument. A common practice is to use a single underscore followed by a number or another character to differentiate between them. Here's an example:\n\n```python\ndef f(a, _1, _2): \n    return a\n```\n\nIn this case, `_1` and `_2` are placeholder names indicating that these arguments are not used in the function body. You can use any naming convention that makes sense to you, as long as each argument has a unique name.\n\nAlternatively, if you don't need to use the arguments at all, you could also consider using a wildcard approach (e.g., `*args`) if the number of unused arguments can vary:\n\n```python\ndef f(a, *unused): \n    return a\n```\n\nIn this setup, `unused` will capture all additional arguments passed to the function, and you can choose to ignore them within the function body."
