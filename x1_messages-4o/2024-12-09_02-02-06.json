I have tried changing the order using the following code: `numpy.array([img[:,:,i] for i in range(3)])`. While this seems to work, it doesn't look very clean and I'm unsure of how to reverse this process to retrieve the original image. Could you guide me on the correct way to change image channel ordering between channels first and channels last?"

        "content": "To switch the image ordering from (x, x, 3) to (3, x, x) and vice versa, you can use NumPy's `transpose` function. This is a cleaner and more efficient way to change the order of the axes in an array.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n### From (x, x, 3) to (3, x, x):\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Assuming 'img' is your image with shape (x, x, 3)\nimg = np.random.rand(128, 128, 3)  # Example image\n\n# Transpose the image to change the order of axes\nimg_channels_first = np.transpose(img, (2, 0, 1))\n```\n\n### From (3, x, x) back to (x, x, 3):\n\n```python\n# Transpose back to the original order\nimg_channels_last = np.transpose(img_channels_first, (1, 2, 0))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- `np.transpose(img, (2, 0, 1))` rearranges the axes of the array. `(2, 0, 1)` means: put the third axis (channels) first, then the first axis (height), and then the second axis (width).\n\n- To reverse the operation, `np.transpose(img_channels_first, (1, 2, 0))` rearranges the axes back to the original order.\n\nThese operations are efficient because they don't actually move the data in memory, they just change the way the array is indexed. This should be both cleaner and faster than using list comprehensions or loops."
