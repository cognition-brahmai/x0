Coconut milk will add a rich, creamy texture and a subtle coconut flavor, which pairs well with vanilla. Here's the modified recipe:\n\n1. **1 cup of gluten-free flour**\n2. **1 teaspoon of aluminum-free baking soda**\n3. **1 teaspoon of non-GMO baking powder**\n4. **1/2 teaspoon of Himalayan pink salt**\n5. **3/4 cup of organic cane sugar**\n6. **1 egg from pasture-raised chickens**\n7. **1/2 cup of coconut milk** (instead of unsweetened almond milk)\n8. **1/2 cup of grass-fed butter**\n\nThis substitution keeps the recipe suitable for those with nut allergies while introducing a delicious new flavor profile. Enjoy your coconut vanilla cake!"
