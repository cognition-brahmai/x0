        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to another process already using port 5000 on your macOS Monterey system. This is causing both the built-in HTTP server and Flask to fail or give unexpected results when trying to bind to that port. The 403 Forbidden error you're seeing suggests that some other service is running on port 5000, likely a system service like AirPlay or another application.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Find the Process Using Port 5000:**\n\n   Run the following command in your terminal to identify the process currently using port 5000:\n\n   ```bash\n   lsof -i :5000\n   ```\n\n   This will list the process ID (PID) and the application that is using port 5000.\n\n2. **Kill the Process (if appropriate):**\n\n   If the process using port 5000 is not critical to your system operations and you want to terminate it, use the `kill` command with the PID you found in the previous step:\n\n   ```bash\n   kill <PID>\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<PID>` with the actual process ID from the `lsof` output.\n\n3. **Use a Different Port:**\n\n   If you do not want to or cannot terminate the process using port 5000, you can run your Flask application on a different port. For example, you can run it on port 5001:\n\n   For Flask, start the application with a specific port:\n\n   ```bash\n   flask run --port=5001\n   ```\n\n   For the built-in HTTP server, specify a different port like 8000:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m http.server 8000\n   ```\n\n4. **Check Firewall Settings:**\n\n   Ensure that your firewall settings are not blocking the port you are trying to use. You can manage firewall settings in System Preferences under \"Security & Privacy\" > \"Firewall.\"\n\n5. **Verify Flask Environment Variables:**\n\n   Make sure your Flask application is set up correctly with the environment variables:\n\n   ```bash\n   export FLASK_APP=hello\n   export FLASK_ENV=development\n   ```\n\n6. **Restart Your Computer:**\n\n   If none of the above steps work, restarting your computer might help release the port if a system service has it locked.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and access your Flask application or any other web server on your desired port."
