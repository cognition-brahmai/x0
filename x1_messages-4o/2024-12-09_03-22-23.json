After installing python32 through homebrew and adding \"export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:~/bin:$PATH\" to my .bash_profile, the terminal still points to \"/usr/bin/python\" when I type 'which python'. Even when I type 'python --version', I still get 'Python 2.7.2'. I've tried overwriting the link to python using \"brew link --overwrite python\" and removing the homebrew python version with \"brew remove python\", but both commands give me the error \"Error: No such keg: /usr/local/Cellar/python\". How can I fix this?"

Here's a step-by-step guide to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Install Python via Homebrew**:\n   First, make sure you've installed Python using Homebrew correctly. You can do this by running:\n   ```bash\n   brew install python\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify Installation**:\n   After installation, verify that Python is installed by checking its location:\n   ```bash\n   brew list python\n   ```\n\n3. **Update your .bash_profile**:\n   Make sure your `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc` (if you're using zsh) is configured correctly. You should add the Homebrew path to the beginning of the PATH variable:\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin:$PATH\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Source your profile**:\n   After editing your profile, source it to apply the changes:\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bash_profile\n   ```\n   or if you are using zsh:\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.zshrc\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify the Python version**:\n   Check which Python is being used and its version:\n   ```bash\n   which python3\n   python3 --version\n   ```\n\n6. **Use Python 3 as Default**:\n   Since Python 2 and Python 3 can coexist on your system, it\u2019s a good practice to use `python3` and `pip3` for Python 3. To make Python 3 the default version, create an alias in your profile:\n   ```bash\n   alias python='python3'\n   alias pip='pip3'\n   ```\n\n7. **Link Python via Brew**:\n   If you encounter issues with linking, try:\n   ```bash\n   brew link python\n   ```\n\n8. **Check for Conflicts**:\n   Ensure there are no conflicts with other Python installations. You can check if there are any conflicts by:\n   ```bash\n   brew doctor\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, your terminal should point to the Homebrew-installed Python when you type `python` or `python3`. You might need to restart your terminal session after making these changes."
