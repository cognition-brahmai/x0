Could someone help me create a regular expression that does this?"

This allows for any characters to be present between 'Run' and '.py'.\n- `\\.py`: Matches the literal string '.py'. The backslash (`\\`) is used to escape the dot (`.`), which is a special character in regex that matches any character except line terminators.\n- `$`: Asserts the position at the end of the string.\n\nThis pattern will match strings like 'RunFoo.py', 'RunBar.py', and 'Run42.py', but it will not match strings like 'myRunFoo.py', 'RunBar.py1', or 'Run42.txt'."
