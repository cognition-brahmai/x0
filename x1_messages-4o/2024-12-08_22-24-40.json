The set of strings is presented in XML format and is enclosed within a <strings> tag. The first pair of strings whose values are equal needs to be identified. To achieve this, I need to implement the find_equal_value_pair() function in Python. The function takes in a set of strings as an argument and returns a tuple with the first pair of strings found. Can you provide an optimized solution to achieve this task?"

        "content": "To solve this problem, you need to parse the XML data to extract the strings, and then find the first pair of strings whose ASCII value sums are equal. Here's an optimized solution using Python:\n\n```python\nimport xml.etree.ElementTree as ET\n\ndef ascii_value_sum(s):\n    return sum(ord(char) for char in s)\n\ndef find_equal_value_pair(xml_data):\n    # Parse the XML data\n    root = ET.fromstring(xml_data)\n    \n    # Extract strings from the XML\n    strings = [elem.text for elem in root.findall('string')]\n    \n    # Dictionary to store the sum of ASCII values and their corresponding strings\n    sum_dict = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over each string\n    for string in strings:\n        # Calculate the sum of ASCII values\n        value_sum = ascii_value_sum(string)\n        \n        # Check if this sum already exists in the dictionary\n        if value_sum in sum_dict:\n            # Return the first pair of strings found\n            return (sum_dict[value_sum], string)\n        else:\n            # Store the string for this sum\n            sum_dict[value_sum] = string\n            \n    # Return None if no pair is found\n    return None\n\n# Example usage\nxml_data = \"\"\"\n<strings>\n    <string>abc</string>\n    <string>def</string>\n    <string>ghi</string>\n    <string>cab</string>\n</strings>\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = find_equal_value_pair(xml_data)\nprint(result)  # Output: ('abc', 'cab')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Parsing XML**: We use `xml.etree.ElementTree` to parse the XML and extract the strings enclosed in `<string>` tags.\n\n2. **ASCII Value Sum Calculation**: The `ascii_value_sum` function calculates the sum of the ASCII values of characters in a string.\n\n3. **Dictionary for Tracking**: We use a dictionary `sum_dict` to map each ASCII value sum to the string that produces it. This allows us to efficiently check for the existence of a previous string with the same ASCII sum.\n\n4. **Finding the Pair**: As we iterate through the strings, we calculate their ASCII value sum and check if this sum is already in the dictionary. If it is, we have found our first pair of strings with equal ASCII sums and return them as a tuple. Otherwise, we store the string in the dictionary with its ASCII sum as the key.\n\nThis method is efficient because it processes each string in constant time and uses a dictionary for fast lookup, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of strings."
