        "content": "To create a new ice cream flavor in your SQL database with unconventional ingredients like avocado, cactus, and lavender, you can follow these steps. First, ensure that your database has a table to store ice cream flavors. Let's assume you have a table named `ice_cream_flavors` with columns `id`, `name`, and `ingredients`. Here\u2019s how you can insert a new flavor with a unique name:\n\n```sql\n-- Assuming the table structure is as follows:\n-- CREATE TABLE ice_cream_flavors (\n--     id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n--     name VARCHAR(255),\n--     ingredients TEXT\n-- );\n\n-- Insert a new flavor into the `ice_cream_flavors` table\nINSERT INTO ice_cream_flavors (name, ingredients) VALUES\n('Enigma Delight', 'Avocado, Cactus, Lavender, Honey, Lime');\n```\n\n**Flavor Name Explanation:**\n- **Enigma Delight:** This name encapsulates the mystery and uniqueness of the flavor combination. \"Enigma\" refers to the puzzle-like nature of the flavor, inviting customers to decipher its unusual taste profile.\n\nThe SQL code above inserts a new row into the `ice_cream_flavors` table with a creative flavor name and a list of unconventional ingredients including avocado, cactus, and lavender. You can adjust the table name and structure based on your actual database schema."
