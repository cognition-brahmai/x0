        "content": "To solve this problem, you can write a C# program that finds the next largest number with the same number of 1s in its binary representation using bit manipulation techniques. Here's a step-by-step guide and the corresponding code:\n\n1. **Identify the rightmost non-trailing zero** - This is the first zero after a sequence of ones from the right.\n2. **Flip this zero to one** - This increases the number slightly.\n3. **Count the number of ones to the right of this position** - This helps in rearranging the bits.\n4. **Clear all bits to the right of this position** - To get a clean slate for rearrangement.\n5. **Insert the counted ones just to the right of the flipped position** - Ensures the smallest possible next number with the same number of ones.\n\nHere's how you can implement it in C#:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass NextLargestWithSameBinaryOnes\n{\n    static int GetNextLargest(int n)\n    {\n        int c = n;\n        int c0 = 0;\n        int c1 = 0;\n\n        // Count trailing zeros (c0) and ones (c1)\n        while ((c & 1) == 0 && (c != 0))\n        {\n            c0++;\n            c >>= 1;\n        }\n        \n        while ((c & 1) == 1)\n        {\n            c1++;\n            c >>= 1;\n        }\n\n        // If there is no bigger number with the same number of 1s\n        if (c0 + c1 == 31 || c0 + c1 == 0)\n            return -1;\n\n        // Position of the rightmost non-trailing zero\n        int pos = c0 + c1;\n\n        // Flip the rightmost non-trailing zero\n        n |= (1 << pos);\n\n        // Clear all bits to the right of pos\n        n &= ~((1 << pos) - 1);\n\n        // Insert (c1-1) ones on the right\n        n |= (1 << (c1 - 1)) - 1;\n\n        return n;\n    }\n\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        Console.Write(\"Enter an integer: \");\n        if (int.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out int input))\n        {\n            int result = GetNextLargest(input);\n            if (result != -1)\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine($\"The next largest number with the same number of 1s is: {result}\");\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(\"No larger number with the same number of 1s exists.\");\n            }\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Counting zeros (`c0`) and ones (`c1`)**: We move through the bits of the input number `n` to find out how many trailing zeros and ones it has.\n- **Position (`pos`)**: It identifies the rightmost zero that can be flipped to one to form the next larger number.\n- **Flipping and clearing bits**: We flip the identified zero to one, clear bits to the right, and then rearrange the bits to form the smallest number larger than `n` with the same number of 1s.\n- **Edge cases**: The function returns `-1` if no larger number exists with the same number of 1s (e.g., when `n` is composed entirely of 1s).\n\nThis code will prompt you for an integer input and output the next largest number with the same number of 1s in its binary representation."
