The code must ensure that the restaurants are within a 5-mile radius of the user's current location and have at least one vegetarian option on the menu. Please provide a sample code using Yelp API to fetch the restaurant data, sort them by their ratings, number of reviews, and distance from the user's location, and include a filter for vegetarian options."

With this key, you can access the Yelp Fusion API to fetch restaurant data based on specified criteria. Below is a sample C# code that demonstrates how you can fetch restaurant data, filter it based on distance, ratings, number of reviews, and ensure the presence of vegetarian options.\n\nMake sure you have installed the necessary packages, such as `RestSharp` for making HTTP requests. You can install it via NuGet Package Manager.\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing RestSharp;\nusing Newtonsoft.Json.Linq;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        string apiKey = \"YOUR_YELP_API_KEY\"; // Replace with your Yelp API key\n        double userLatitude = 36.1699; // User's current latitude\n        double userLongitude = -115.1398; // User's current longitude\n        double searchRadiusInMiles = 5;\n        double searchRadiusInMeters = searchRadiusInMiles * 1609.34; // Convert miles to meters\n\n        var client = new RestClient(\"https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search\");\n        var request = new RestRequest(Method.GET);\n        request.AddHeader(\"Authorization\", $\"Bearer {apiKey}\");\n        request.AddParameter(\"latitude\", userLatitude);\n        request.AddParameter(\"longitude\", userLongitude);\n        request.AddParameter(\"radius\", searchRadiusInMeters);\n        request.AddParameter(\"categories\", \"restaurants,vegetarian\"); // Filter for vegetarian options\n        request.AddParameter(\"location\", \"Las Vegas\");\n        request.AddParameter(\"limit\", 50); // Limit the number of results\n\n        IRestResponse response = client.Execute(request);\n        var content = response.Content;\n\n        JObject jsonResponse = JObject.Parse(content);\n        var businesses = jsonResponse[\"businesses\"];\n\n        var recommendedRestaurants = businesses\n            .Where(b => (double)b[\"distance\"] <= searchRadiusInMeters &&\n                        b[\"categories\"].Any(c => c[\"alias\"].ToString().Contains(\"vegetarian\")))\n            .Select(b => new\n            {\n                Name = b[\"name\"].ToString(),\n                Rating = (double)b[\"rating\"],\n                ReviewCount = (int)b[\"review_count\"],\n                Distance = (double)b[\"distance\"]\n            })\n            .OrderByDescending(b => b.Rating)\n            .ThenByDescending(b => b.ReviewCount)\n            .ThenBy(b => b.Distance)\n            .ToList();\n\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Recommended Restaurants in Las Vegas:\");\n        foreach (var restaurant in recommendedRestaurants)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Name: {restaurant.Name}, Rating: {restaurant.Rating}, Reviews: {restaurant.ReviewCount}, Distance: {restaurant.Distance / 1609.34:F2} miles\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **API Key**: Replace `\"YOUR_YELP_API_KEY\"` with your actual Yelp API key.\n2. **Parameters**:\n   - `latitude` and `longitude`: Represent the user's current location.\n   - `radius`: Specifies the search radius in meters.\n   - `categories`: Includes both `restaurants` and `vegetarian` to filter for vegetarian options.\n   - `location`: Specifies the city (Las Vegas in this case).\n3. **Filtering**:\n   - Filters restaurants that are within a 5-mile radius and have vegetarian options.\n4. **Sorting**:\n   - Sorts the results primarily by rating, then by the number of reviews, and finally by distance.\n\nThis code provides a basic framework to fetch and filter restaurant data from Yelp based on the specified criteria. You can further refine or extend it as needed."
