Additionally, adding a star to the end of the command does not give an error, but it also does not do anything. Here is a snippet of my config file:\n\n```bash\n[group:tapjoy]\nprograms=tapjoy-game1,tapjoy-game2\n\n[program:tapjoy-game1]\ncommand=python tapjoy_pinger.py -g game1\ndirectory=/go/here/first\nredirect_stderr=true\nautostart=true\nautorestart=true\nstopasgroup=true\nkillasgroup=true\n\n[program:tapjoy-game2]\ncommand=python tapjoy_pinger.py -g game2\ndirectory=/go/here/first\nredirect_stderr=true\nautostart=true\nautorestart=true\nstopasgroup=true\nkillasgroup=true\n```\n\nThe status from `supervisorctl status` is as follows:\n\n```bash\ntapjoy_game1                     RUNNING    pid 4697, uptime 1 day, 21:56:23\ntapjoy_game2                     RUNNING    pid 4698, uptime 1 day, 21:56:23\ntapjoy_game3                     RUNNING    pid 4699, uptime 1 day, 21:56:23\ntapjoy_game4                     RUNNING    pid 4700, uptime 1 day, 21:56:23\ntapjoy_game5                     RUNNING    pid 4701, uptime 1 day, 21:56:23\n```\n\nAm I missing something?"

        "content": "It looks like you're trying to manage a group of processes using Supervisor, but you might be experiencing issues due to a mismatch between the names in your config file and the names shown in the Supervisor status output.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Config File Names**: In your config file, you have defined two programs, `tapjoy-game1` and `tapjoy-game2`. However, in the Supervisor status output, the names appear as `tapjoy_game1`, `tapjoy_game2`, etc. Ensure that the names in your `[program]` sections match exactly with the names used in the Supervisor status output. Supervisor replaces dashes with underscores in the process names when showing status, so the discrepancy might be causing the issue.\n\n2. **Group Name in Command**: When using the `supervisorctl restart` command, ensure you're using the correct group name. You have defined a group `[group:tapjoy]` which includes `tapjoy-game1` and `tapjoy-game2`. To restart all processes in this group, you should use:\n   ```\n   supervisorctl restart tapjoy:\n   ```\n\n3. **Check Group Assignment**: Verify if the `tapjoy_game1` and `tapjoy_game2` processes are indeed part of the `tapjoy` group. This can be checked by ensuring that the group name and program names are correctly matched in the config file.\n\n4. **Restart Supervisor**: If you made changes to the configuration, make sure to update Supervisor with the new configuration by running:\n   ```\n   supervisorctl reread\n   supervisorctl update\n   ```\n\n5. **Wildcard Usage**: Using a wildcard with Supervisor commands can be tricky. Ensure that you are using the correct syntax. If you want to restart all processes that start with `tapjoy-`, you can try:\n   ```\n   supervisorctl restart tapjoy_*\n   ```\n\n6. **Log Files**: Check the Supervisor logs to see if there are any error messages or additional information about why the restart command might not be affecting the processes. The logs can provide insights into issues with the configuration or execution of commands.\n\n7. **Correcting Process Names**: If the issue persists, consider renaming your `[program]` sections in the config file to use underscores instead of dashes to match the names shown in the status output, like so:\n   ```ini\n   [program:tapjoy_game1]\n   [program:tapjoy_game2]\n   ```\n\nMake sure to restart Supervisor after making these changes to ensure your configuration is loaded correctly."
