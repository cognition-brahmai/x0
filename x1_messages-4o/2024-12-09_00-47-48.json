First, when I try to push an element onto the stack using the 'push' method, it throws a TypeError stating that it can only assign an iterable. Secondly, I am unsure about whether I should throw an exception if the 'pop' method is invoked on an empty stack. Here is my code:\n\n```python\nclass Stack(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.storage = []\n\n    def isEmpty(self):\n        return len(self.storage) == 0\n\n    def push(self,p):\n        self.storage[:0] = p\n\n    def pop(self):\n        \"\"\"issue: throw exception?\"\"\"\n        return None\n```"

        "content": "It looks like you're trying to implement a stack data structure in Python. Let's address the issues you've mentioned:\n\n1. **TypeError when using `push` method:**\n   The issue arises because you're trying to assign `p` to `self.storage[:0]` as if `p` is an iterable. In Python, when you use slice assignment like `self.storage[:0] = p`, `p` must be an iterable (like a list, tuple, etc.). However, in a stack, you typically want to append a single item to the end of the list. You should use the `append` method instead:\n\n   ```python\n   def push(self, p):\n       self.storage.append(p)\n   ```\n\n2. **Exception when `pop` is called on an empty stack:**\n   It is a common practice to throw an exception when trying to pop an element from an empty stack. This helps signal that the operation cannot be completed as expected due to the stack being empty. You can use Python's `IndexError`, which is typically used for such cases:\n\n   ```python\n   def pop(self):\n       if self.isEmpty():\n           raise IndexError(\"pop from empty stack\")\n       return self.storage.pop()\n   ```\n\nHere's the corrected version of your stack implementation:\n\n```python\nclass Stack(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.storage = []\n\n    def isEmpty(self):\n        return len(self.storage) == 0\n\n    def push(self, p):\n        self.storage.append(p)\n\n    def pop(self):\n        if self.isEmpty():\n            raise IndexError(\"pop from empty stack\")\n        return self.storage.pop()\n```\n\nThis should resolve the issues you're facing. You can now use the `push` method to add elements to the stack, and if you try to `pop` from an empty stack, an `IndexError` will be raised."
