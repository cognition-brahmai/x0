I am trying to make a large number of HTTP requests concurrently using Python's threading and requests module but I am encountering the following warning in my logs: \"WARNING:requests.packages.urllib3.connectionpool:HttpConnectionPool is full, discarding connection\". Does it mean the connection pool at my client is full or a connection pool at the server is full and this is the error my client is receiving? How can I increase the size of the connection pool for requests?"

        "content": "The warning you are encountering, \"HttpConnectionPool is full, discarding connection,\" indicates that the connection pool on your client side (specifically within the `requests` library) is full. This warning is related to the pool of reusable HTTP connections managed by the `requests` library via `urllib3`. When you make a large number of concurrent requests, the default connection pool size might not be sufficient, leading to this warning.\n\nTo increase the connection pool size, you can use a `Session` object from the `requests` library, which allows you to configure connection pooling settings. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Use a `Session` object**: A `Session` object in `requests` allows you to persist certain parameters across requests. It also maintains a connection pool for efficiency.\n\n2. **Configure the adapter**: You can set the maximum number of connections using the `HTTPAdapter` with the `pool_connections` and `pool_maxsize` parameters. This allows you to control the size of the connection pool.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how to increase the connection pool size:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter\nfrom requests.packages.urllib3.util.retry import Retry\n\n# Create a session object\nsession = requests.Session()\n\n# Define the max number of connections and retries\nadapter = HTTPAdapter(pool_connections=100, pool_maxsize=100)\n\n# Mount the adapter to the session\nsession.mount('http://', adapter)\nsession.mount('https://', adapter)\n\n# Now use `session` to make requests\ndef fetch_url(url):\n    try:\n        response = session.get(url)\n        print(f\"Fetched {url}: {response.status_code}\")\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(e)\n\nurls = ['https://example.com'] * 100  # Example list of URLs\n\n# Use threading to make requests concurrently\nimport threading\nthreads = [threading.Thread(target=fetch_url, args=(url,)) for url in urls]\n\nfor thread in threads:\n    thread.start()\n\nfor thread in threads:\n    thread.join()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`HTTPAdapter`**: We create an instance of `HTTPAdapter` with custom pool sizes using `pool_connections` and `pool_maxsize`.\n- **Mounting the adapter**: We mount this adapter to the session for both HTTP and HTTPS protocols.\n- **Threading**: We use Python's `threading` module to make concurrent requests.\n\nThis setup should help you manage a larger number of concurrent connections without hitting the default connection pool limit, thus reducing the likelihood of receiving the warning. Adjust `pool_connections` and `pool_maxsize` according to your specific requirements and system capabilities."
