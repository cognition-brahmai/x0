        "content": "Should feature selection be performed before or after splitting the data into training and test sets? I'm facing a contradiction between two facts. One suggests doing it after splitting to avoid information leakage from the test set. However, the other suggests that if only the training set is used for feature selection, the feature importance score orders may change with variations in the random state of the Train-Test-Split. This can lead to non-generalizable feature importance, which is undesirable. Additionally, if only the training set is used, the test set may contain instances that contradict the feature selection, since the overall historical data is not analyzed. Feature importance scores can only be evaluated when a set of instances is given, not a single test or unknown instance."

        "content": "Your dilemma highlights a common challenge in feature selection for machine learning workflows. Let's break down the considerations for both approaches:\n\n### 1. **Feature Selection Before Splitting:**\n   - **Pros:**\n     - You utilize all available data to determine feature importance, which can potentially lead to a more robust selection since it reflects the entire dataset.\n     - This approach ensures that your feature selection does not vary with different train-test splits, as the same features will be selected regardless of the random state.\n\n   - **Cons:**\n     - There's a risk of information leakage. You might inadvertently use information from the test set to inform your model, which can lead to overly optimistic performance estimates.\n     - The model might seem to perform better during evaluation because it has indirectly \"seen\" test data through feature selection.\n\n### 2. **Feature Selection After Splitting:**\n   - **Pros:**\n     - By using only the training data for feature selection, you maintain a realistic and unbiased estimate of your model's performance on unseen data. This simulates a real-world scenario where the model encounters new data.\n     - It avoids information leakage, ensuring that the test set remains a completely independent validation set.\n\n   - **Cons:**\n     - The feature importance scores may vary with different splits, leading to variability in the selected features.\n     - If the training set is not representative of the overall data distribution, important features may be missed.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Cross-Validation:** One way to mitigate the variability in feature selection due to different splits is to use cross-validation. By performing feature selection within each fold of the cross-validation, you can get a more stable estimate of feature importance that takes into account different subsets of the data.\n\n- **Nested Cross-Validation:** This is a more robust technique where you perform an inner loop of cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning and feature selection and an outer loop for evaluating model performance. This ensures that feature selection is done independently of the test set.\n\n- **Stability Analysis:** If you are concerned about the stability of feature selection, you can perform a stability analysis to see how often certain features are selected across various train-test splits or cross-validation folds.\n\n- **Domain Knowledge:** Incorporating domain knowledge can help guide feature selection and ensure that important features are not overlooked, even if they do not appear significant in a purely data-driven selection process.\n\nUltimately, the best approach depends on the specific characteristics of your dataset and the goals of your analysis. A combination of these techniques often provides a balanced solution."
