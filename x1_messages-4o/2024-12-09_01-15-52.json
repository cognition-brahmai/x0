        "content": "The error message indicates that you're trying to add a non-nullable field `id` to the `contact_info` model without specifying a default value, which is required to populate existing rows in the database.\n\nBy default, Django automatically adds an `id` field as the primary key to each model if one is not specified. If you are trying to add an additional `id` field or a different unique identifier, you need to handle existing data properly.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check if you actually need an additional `id` field.** Django already provides a primary key `id` field for each model. If you just need a primary key, you can use the default one provided by Django.\n\n2. **If you need a custom primary key:**\n   - Make sure to specify it in your model. You cannot have two primary key fields. If you want to use something other than the default `id`, you need to specify it explicitly and remove the default `id`.\n   - For example, if you want to use `email` as the primary key, you can modify your model like this:\n\n   ```python\n   class contact_info(models.Model):\n       first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n       last_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n       email = models.EmailField(primary_key=True)\n       contact_numbers = models.ManyToManyField(contact_number)\n       addresses = models.ManyToManyField(contact_address)\n   ```\n\n3. **If you want to add a new non-nullable field:**\n   - Provide a default value or allow null values. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   class contact_info(models.Model):\n       first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n       last_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n       email = models.EmailField()\n       contact_numbers = models.ManyToManyField(contact_number)\n       addresses = models.ManyToManyField(contact_address)\n       new_field = models.CharField(max_length=100, default='default_value')  # Example of a default value\n   ```\n\n4. **If you're modifying the existing `id` field:**\n   - If you are trying to alter the existing `id` field, ensure you provide a migration path for existing data, typically by using a default value or making it nullable initially.\n\nAlways back up your database before making schema changes. After making the necessary changes to your models, run `python manage.py makemigrations` and then `python manage.py migrate` to apply the changes."
