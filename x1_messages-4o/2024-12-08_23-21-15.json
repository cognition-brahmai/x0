Assuming your \"Data\" column starts from cell A2 (with A1 being the header \"Data\"), you can use the following formula in the adjacent column (let's say column B) to achieve the desired result:\n\n1. In cell B2, enter the formula:\n   ```\n   =A2/3\n   ```\n\n2. After entering the formula in B2, press Enter.\n\n3. Then, drag the fill handle (a small square at the bottom-right corner of the cell) down from B2 to fill the formula down the column for all the rows that contain data in column A.\n\nThis will compute the division of each number by 3 and display the result in column B."
