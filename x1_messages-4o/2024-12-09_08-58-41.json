        "content": "To generate all distinct permutations of a given string, you can use a recursive approach or utilize libraries that handle permutations. Here\u2019s how you can do it in Python using both methods:\n\n### Method 1: Using Recursion\n\nThis method involves backtracking to generate permutations and ensuring that only distinct permutations are produced.\n\n```python\ndef permute(s):\n    def backtrack(path, options):\n        if not options:\n            result.add(\"\".join(path))\n        for i in range(len(options)):\n            # Choose\n            path.append(options[i])\n            \n            # Explore\n            backtrack(path, options[:i] + options[i+1:])\n            \n            # Un-choose\n            path.pop()\n    \n    result = set()\n    backtrack([], list(s))\n    return list(result)\n\n# Example usage\nstring = \"abc\"\nprint(permute(string))\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using `itertools.permutations`\n\nPython\u2019s `itertools` library provides a straightforward way to generate permutations. To ensure distinct permutations, you can convert the result into a set.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef distinct_permutations(s):\n    return set(''.join(p) for p in permutations(s))\n\n# Example usage\nstring = \"abc\"\nprint(distinct_permutations(string))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Recursion and Backtracking**: The recursive approach uses backtracking to explore all possible arrangements of the characters in the string. By adding results to a set, duplicate permutations are automatically eliminated.\n\n- **`itertools.permutations`**: This function generates all possible permutations of the input string. Converting the result to a set removes duplicates, giving you only distinct permutations.\n\nBoth methods will give you the distinct permutations of the string. You can choose the one that best suits your needs based on readability and performance considerations."
