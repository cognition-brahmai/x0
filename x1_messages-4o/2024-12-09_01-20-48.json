I understand these additional packages have dependencies to 'pandas', possibly even to specific versions of it, but is there any way to uninstall only one package with conda? I am planning to uninstall the conda version of 'pandas' and use pip to install 'pandas' from the master on the official repo GitHub."

        "content": "Uninstalling a specific package in a conda environment without affecting other packages can be a bit tricky due to dependency management. However, you can try the following steps to minimize the risk of altering other packages:\n\n1. **Backup Environment**: Before making any changes, it's a good idea to back up your current environment. You can do this by exporting it to a YAML file:\n   ```bash\n   conda env export > environment_backup.yml\n   ```\n\n2. **Uninstall Pandas**: Attempt to remove the `pandas` package using the `--force` option. This option will remove the package without considering dependencies, but use it cautiously:\n   ```bash\n   conda remove pandas --force\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Pandas with pip**: Once `pandas` is removed, you can install it using pip. This allows you to install the version from the master branch on GitHub:\n   ```bash\n   pip install git+https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas.git\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify Installation**: Check the installed version of `pandas` to ensure the installation was successful and the correct version is being used:\n   ```bash\n   python -c \"import pandas as pd; print(pd.__version__)\"\n   ```\n\n5. **Test Environment**: Run your critical scripts or tests to ensure that everything is working as expected with the new `pandas` installation.\n\nRemember that using `pip` to install packages in a `conda` environment can sometimes lead to conflicts, especially if the packages have C extensions or other complex dependencies. It's generally best to try to keep everything within the conda ecosystem if possible, but if you need the latest development version, `pip` is the way to go."
