To make things more interesting, use a Python dictionary to store these words along with their respective categories, using 'n' to denote a noun and 'v' to represent a verb. Can you provide your final solution in the form of a well-organized dictionary? Bear in mind that this is a challenging puzzle that will require your highest reasoning abilities to solve."

Here's how you can organize them into a Python dictionary:\n\n```python\nwords_category = {\n    'apple': 'n',  # noun\n    'dog': 'n',    # noun\n    'table': 'n'   # noun\n}\n```\n\nIn this dictionary, 'n' denotes that each word is a noun. None of these words commonly function as verbs in their standard usage."
