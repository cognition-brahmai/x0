However, I am not able to find `np.int0` in any online documentation unlike `np.uint8`, `np.int32`, etc. Can anyone explain what exactly is `np.int0` and what kind of integer does it cast arguments to?"

        "content": "The `np.int0` is actually an alias for `np.int64` or `np.int32`, depending on the platform you are using. It is one of the data types provided by NumPy for integer representation. The reason you might not find explicit documentation for `np.int0` is because it's less commonly used and not explicitly listed in most documentations.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n- `np.int0` is essentially equivalent to `np.intp`, which is an integer type used for indexing. This means that on a 64-bit platform, `np.int0` is equivalent to `np.int64`, and on a 32-bit platform, it is equivalent to `np.int32`.\n- When you use `np.int0`, you're converting the data to the default integer type based on your platform's architecture.\n\nIn OpenCV problems, when `np.int0` is used to convert bounding box floating point values to integers, it ensures that the conversion is done according to the platform's native integer size, which can be important for compatibility and performance reasons. However, for clarity and explicitness, it might be better to use `np.int32` or `np.int64` directly, depending on your needs."
