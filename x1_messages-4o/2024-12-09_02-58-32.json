I'm trying to use list comprehension to apply a function to each element in this list of lists. However, when I run the following code: `[number+1 for group in x for number in group]`, I get a single long list `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`. What I want to achieve is to keep my output as a list of lists, like this: `[[2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10]]`. How can I modify my list comprehension to achieve this?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired output of maintaining the structure as a list of lists, you can nest the list comprehensions. Essentially, you want to apply the transformation to each sublist individually. Here's how you can modify your list comprehension:\n\n```python\nx = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\nresult = [[number + 1 for number in group] for group in x]\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over each sublist (`group`) in the outer list (`x`), and then apply the transformation (`number + 1`) to each element (`number`) in that sublist. The result will be a list of lists, preserving the original structure:\n\n```python\n[[2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10]]\n```\n\nThis approach effectively applies the function to each element while keeping the nested list structure intact."
