        "content": "Welcome to the Puzzle Challenge! Here is a complex language puzzle for you to build a robust customer support system. Assume you are implementing a customer support system for an online store that uses Ruby on Rails. Your goal is to develop a sophisticated Ruby code that can automatically handle and respond to customer inquiries with contextual information. To achieve this, you need to write a program that can reason and generate appropriate responses based on customer queries using machine learning algorithms. Your code should have the ability to understand and respond to different types of customer inquiries, such as product-related inquiries, shipping inquiries, and return inquiries. \nYou have access to the following code snippet to get you started:\n```\nclass CustomerInquiry\n  def initialize(inquiry)\n    @inquiry = inquiry\n  end\n  def handle_inquiry\n    # your sophisticated code that incorporates machine learning algorithms and contextual information to generate responses goes here\n  end\nend\n```\nYour task is to complete the `handle_inquiry` method with a sophisticated algorithm that can handle and respond to customer inquiries by taking into account all relevant information, including the customer's purchase history, search history, and browsing behavior. Best of luck!"

        "content": "To develop a sophisticated customer support system that can handle customer inquiries and respond appropriately using Ruby on Rails, we can incorporate a machine learning model to process and understand the context of each inquiry. Here\u2019s a step-by-step solution to complete the `handle_inquiry` method in the `CustomerInquiry` class:\n\n1. **Preprocessing and Loading Data**: Load relevant customer data such as purchase history, search history, and browsing behavior. This data will help us generate contextual responses.\n\n2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Use NLP techniques to understand the inquiry and extract key features. For example, identify if the inquiry is about a product, shipping, or return.\n\n3. **Machine Learning Model**: Implement or integrate a pre-trained machine learning model capable of classification and response generation. You can use a model like BERT or GPT for language understanding.\n\n4. **Response Generation**: Based on the model\u2019s output and the context derived from customer data, generate an appropriate response.\n\n5. **Feedback Loop**: Incorporate a feedback mechanism to continuously improve the model\u2019s accuracy and response quality over time.\n\nHere's a basic structure of how you can start implementing this:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'nlp_toolkit'  # Hypothetical library for NLP\nrequire 'ml_model'     # Hypothetical library for ML model\n\nclass CustomerInquiry\n  def initialize(inquiry, customer_data)\n    @inquiry = inquiry\n    @customer_data = customer_data\n    @nlp = NLPToolkit.new\n    @ml_model = MLModel.load('path/to/pretrained/model')\n  end\n  \n  def handle_inquiry\n    # Step 1: Preprocess inquiry\n    processed_inquiry = @nlp.preprocess(@inquiry)\n    \n    # Step 2: Extract features\n    features = @nlp.extract_features(processed_inquiry)\n    \n    # Step 3: Add contextual customer data\n    features.merge!(@customer_data.contextual_features)\n    \n    # Step 4: Predict inquiry type and generate response\n    response_type = @ml_model.predict(features)\n    \n    # Step 5: Generate response based on prediction\n    response = generate_response(response_type, features)\n    \n    # Step 6: Return the generated response\n    response\n  end\n\n  private\n\n  def generate_response(response_type, features)\n    case response_type\n    when 'product_inquiry'\n      \"It looks like you're interested in our products. Based on your browsing history, I recommend checking out our latest offers on similar items.\"\n    when 'shipping_inquiry'\n      \"I see you have an order in transit. You can track it using this link: [tracking_link]. Estimated delivery is within 3-5 business days.\"\n    when 'return_inquiry'\n      \"I understand you want to return an item. Please visit our return portal or contact our support team for assistance.\"\n    else\n      \"I'm here to help with any questions you have. Could you provide more details on your inquiry?\"\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **NLP Toolkit**: A hypothetical library for text preprocessing and feature extraction.\n- **ML Model**: A hypothetical machine learning model to classify the inquiry type.\n- **Customer Data**: Used to provide contextual responses.\n- **Response Generation**: Tailors responses based on inquiry type and customer context.\n\nThis implementation assumes access to suitable NLP and ML libraries. In a production environment, you would replace these with actual libraries like `nltk`, `spaCy`, or TensorFlow models, and ensure seamless integration with your data sources and application infrastructure."
