When I run the command `pip install --upgrade 'python>=2.7,<2.7.99'` it starts downloading Python 2.7.5 but then I get an error. The error message is:\n\n```\nDownloading/unpacking python>=2.7,<2.7.99\n  Downloading Python-2.7.5.tar.bz2 (12.1MB): 12.1MB downloaded\n  Running setup.py egg_info for package python\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n      File \"<string>\", line 16, in <module>\n      File \"c:\\users\\name\\appdata\\local\\temp\\pip-build-name\\python\\setup.py\", line 33, in <module>\n        COMPILED_WITH_PYDEBUG = ('--with-pydebug' in sysconfig.get_config_var(\"CONFIG_ARGS\"))\n    TypeError: argument of type 'NoneType' is not iterable\n    Complete output from command python setup.py egg_info:\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n\n  File \"<string>\", line 16, in <module>\n\n  File \"c:\\users\\name\\appdata\\local\\temp\\pip-build-name\\python\\setup.py\", line 33, in <module>\n\n    COMPILED_WITH_PYDEBUG = ('--with-pydebug' in sysconfig.get_config_var(\"CONFIG_ARGS\"))\n\nTypeError: argument of type 'NoneType' is not iterable\n\n----------------------------------------\nCommand python setup.py egg_info failed with error code 1 in c:\\users\\name\\appdata\\local\\temp\\pip-build-name\\python\n```\n\nAlso, I am new to pip and at one point I cancelled a download when it started downloading Python version 3. Is this safe and would it have overridden my main Python 2.7.3 install?"

        "content": "To upgrade Python itself, using `pip` is not an appropriate method. `pip` is a package manager for Python packages, not for managing Python versions themselves. To upgrade your Python installation, you need to download and install the newer version manually.\n\nHere's how you can upgrade Python 2.7.3 to 2.7.5 on a Windows machine:\n\n1. **Download the Python 2.7.5 Installer:**\n   - Go to the official Python website or a trusted source that still hosts older versions of Python.\n   - Download the Windows installer for Python 2.7.5 (make sure to get the 64-bit version if your system is 64-bit).\n\n2. **Install Python 2.7.5:**\n   - Run the installer you downloaded.\n   - During the installation process, make sure to select options that suit your needs. You may want to ensure that Python is added to your system PATH for easier access from the command line.\n\n3. **Verify Installation:**\n   - Open a command prompt and type `python --version` to check that Python 2.7.5 is now the version that's installed.\n\nRegarding the download cancellation of Python 3, as long as you didn't complete the installation, it shouldn't have overridden your existing Python 2.7.3 install. Python installations on Windows typically allow you to install multiple versions side by side. However, they might conflict if the paths are not set correctly. If you are concerned about any residual changes, you can manually check your `PATH` environment variable to ensure that it points to the correct Python version you want to use.\n\nIf you wish to manage multiple Python versions easily, consider using tools such as `pyenv` (though it's more common on UNIX-like systems) or the Windows Python Launcher, which can help manage multiple Python installations."
