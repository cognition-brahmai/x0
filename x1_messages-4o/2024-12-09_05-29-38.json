I am familiar with the `train_test_split` function from `sklearn.cross_validation` which only divides the data into two sets (train and test). I am also interested in retaining the indices of the original data. Is there a standard or built-in method to split the data into three sets instead of two, or should I use `train_test_split` twice and adjust the indices accordingly?"

        "content": "To split your pandas DataFrame into three subsets (training, validation, and test sets) while retaining the indices of the original data, you can indeed use the `train_test_split` function from `sklearn.model_selection` twice. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming df is your original DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(...)  # Your data here\n\n# Step 1: Split the data into two parts (train+val and test)\ntrain_val_df, test_df = train_test_split(df, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Step 2: Split the train+val into train and validation\ntrain_df, val_df = train_test_split(train_val_df, test_size=0.25, random_state=42)\n# Note: 0.25 x 0.8 = 0.2, so val_df will be 20% of the original data\n\n# Now you have train_df, val_df, and test_df\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **First Split**: You split the original DataFrame into two parts: `train_val_df` (80% of the data) and `test_df` (20% of the data).\n2. **Second Split**: You further split `train_val_df` into `train_df` and `val_df`, with `val_df` being 25% of `train_val_df`. This results in `val_df` being 20% of the original DataFrame, leaving `train_df` as 60% of the original data.\n\nBy using `random_state=42`, you ensure that you get the same split every time you run the code, which is useful for reproducibility. You can adjust the `test_size` and `random_state` parameters as needed for your specific use case."
