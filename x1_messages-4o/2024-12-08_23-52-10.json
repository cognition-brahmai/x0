        "content": "A double helix shape is a three-dimensional structure resembling a twisted ladder or spiral staircase. It consists of two long strands that wind around each other, each forming a helix. In the context of DNA, which is the most well-known example of a double helix, these two strands are composed of nucleotides. The backbone of each strand is made up of sugar and phosphate groups, and the strands are connected by pairs of nitrogenous bases (adenine with thymine, and guanine with cytosine) that form the \"rungs\" of the ladder. The structure is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the paired bases, and it twists in a right-handed direction. This configuration allows DNA to store genetic information efficiently and replicate accurately."
