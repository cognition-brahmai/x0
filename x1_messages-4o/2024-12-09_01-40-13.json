I am running a query to my SQL database and I want to store the returned data as a Pandas data structure. However, I am having trouble identifying the return type of my query. Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\n\nengine2 = create_engine('mysql://THE DATABASE I AM ACCESSING')\nconnection2 = engine2.connect()\ndataid = 1022\nresoverall = connection2.execute(\"\n    SELECT \n       sum(BLABLA) AS BLA,\n       sum(BLABLABLA2) AS BLABLABLA2,\n       sum(SOME_INT) AS SOME_INT,\n       sum(SOME_INT2) AS SOME_INT2,\n       100*sum(SOME_INT2)/sum(SOME_INT) AS ctr,\n       sum(SOME_INT2)/sum(SOME_INT) AS cpc\n    FROM daily_report_cooked\n    WHERE campaign_id = '%s'\",\n    %dataid\n)\n```\nI want to understand the format/data type of my variable \"resoverall\" and how to put it into a Pandas data structure."

        "content": "To convert the result of an SQL query to a Pandas DataFrame, you can use the `pandas.read_sql_query` method. However, in your current setup, you're using `connection2.execute()` which returns a `ResultProxy` object. This object is a cursor-like structure that gives you access to the results of your query. To convert this result to a Pandas DataFrame, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Import Pandas**: Make sure you have Pandas imported in your script.\n\n2. **Use Pandas to Read the SQL Query**: Instead of executing the query and handling the result manually, you can use Pandas to directly read the SQL query result into a DataFrame.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create the engine\nengine2 = create_engine('mysql://THE DATABASE I AM ACCESSING')\n\n# Define the query you want to execute\nquery = \"\"\"\n    SELECT \n       sum(BLABLA) AS BLA,\n       sum(BLABLABLA2) AS BLABLABLA2,\n       sum(SOME_INT) AS SOME_INT,\n       sum(SOME_INT2) AS SOME_INT2,\n       100*sum(SOME_INT2)/sum(SOME_INT) AS ctr,\n       sum(SOME_INT2)/sum(SOME_INT) AS cpc\n    FROM daily_report_cooked\n    WHERE campaign_id = %s\n\"\"\" % dataid\n\n# Use Pandas to execute the query and read the result into a DataFrame\ndf = pd.read_sql_query(query, con=engine2)\n\n# Now df is a Pandas DataFrame containing your query results\nprint(df)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **`pd.read_sql_query`**: This function takes a SQL query string and a database connection and returns a DataFrame.\n- **Format the Query Correctly**: Ensure your SQL query string is correctly formatted. In this example, Python's string formatting is used to insert the `dataid` variable into the query.\n- **`con=engine2`**: Pass the SQLAlchemy engine directly to `pd.read_sql_query` as the connection.\n\nThis will store your query result in the `df` DataFrame, which you can then manipulate or analyze using Pandas functionalities."
