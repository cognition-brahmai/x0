I am trying to get the values of multiple selected checkboxes using `request.POST['recommendations']` as a list in my view code. However, the 'recommendations' variable is only storing the value that got assigned in the last for loop iteration, instead of all the selected checkboxes. How can I solve this issue to get a list of all friend ids from the selected checkboxes?\n\nHere is my model, template and view code:\n\nModel:\n```python\nclass Recommend(models.Model):\n  user=models.ForeignKey(User)\n  book=models.ForeignKey(BookModel)\n  friends=models.ManyToManyField(User, related_name=\"recommended\")\n```\n\nTemplate:\n```html\n{% for friend in friends %}\n\n<input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"recommendations\" id=\"option{{friend.id}}\" value={{friend.username}} />\n<label for=\"option{{friend.id}}\"><b>{{friend.username}}</b></label><br />\n\n{% endfor %}\n```\n\nView code:\n```python\nif request.method == 'POST': \n  recommendations=request.POST['recommendations']\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that when you use `request.POST['recommendations']`, it retrieves only a single value even if multiple checkboxes are selected. In HTML forms, when you have multiple checkboxes with the same `name` attribute, you need to use `request.POST.getlist('name')` to retrieve all the selected values as a list.\n\nHere's how you can modify your view code to handle multiple selected checkboxes:\n\n### Modified View Code:\n```python\nif request.method == 'POST': \n    # Use getlist to retrieve all selected checkbox values as a list\n    recommendations = request.POST.getlist('recommendations')\n    # Now, recommendations will be a list of all selected friend usernames\n    print(recommendations)  # This will print the list of selected usernames for debugging purposes\n\n    # If you want to work with friend IDs instead, ensure the checkbox values are set to friend.id in the template\n    # and adjust your logic accordingly.\n    # Example:\n    # recommendations = request.POST.getlist('recommendations')\n    # for friend_id in recommendations:\n    #     friend = User.objects.get(id=friend_id)\n    #     # Process each selected friend\n```\n\n### Additional Enhancements:\n1. **Use Friend IDs**: If you want to work with friend IDs instead of usernames in your backend logic, set the `value` attribute of the checkbox to `{{ friend.id }}` instead of `{{ friend.username }}` in your template. Update the `getlist` processing logic to handle these IDs.\n\n### Updated Template Code:\n```html\n{% for friend in friends %}\n    <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"recommendations\" id=\"option{{ friend.id }}\" value=\"{{ friend.id }}\" />\n    <label for=\"option{{ friend.id }}\"><b>{{ friend.username }}</b></label><br />\n{% endfor %}\n```\n\nThis setup ensures that you get a list of all selected friend IDs, which you can then use to perform any operations, such as creating recommendations or updating the database."
