Here's how you can structure it:\n\n[Formula] \"subject + present continuous tense + object + preposition + duration of time\" [Formula]\n\nExample:\nOriginal (Present Perfect Continuous): \"She has been studying mathematics for three hours.\"\nRephrased (Present Continuous): \"She is studying mathematics for three hours.\"\n\nNote that using the present continuous with a specific duration can sometimes imply a planned or ongoing activity rather than an activity that has continued up to the present moment."
