        "content": "To create a PostgreSQL query that aggregates total sales by country, you would typically use the `GROUP BY` clause along with aggregate functions like `SUM()`. Assuming you have a `sales` table with columns such as `country` and `amount`, where `amount` represents the sales amount, the query would look something like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT country, SUM(amount) AS total_sales\nFROM sales\nGROUP BY country\nORDER BY total_sales DESC;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`SELECT country, SUM(amount) AS total_sales`:** This part of the query selects the `country` column and calculates the sum of the `amount` column for each country. The result is aliased as `total_sales`.\n\n- **`FROM sales`:** This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data.\n\n- **`GROUP BY country`:** This groups the results by the `country` column. Each group will contain all the rows for a specific country, and the `SUM(amount)` will be calculated for each of these groups.\n\n- **`ORDER BY total_sales DESC`:** This orders the final result set by the `total_sales` in descending order, so you can easily see which countries have the highest sales.\n\nMake sure that your `sales` table contains the necessary columns (`country` and `amount` in this example) for this query to work correctly. Adjust the column names and table name as per your actual database schema."
