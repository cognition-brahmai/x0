The alliteration must have a clear theme related to tropical fruits and must also include at least two rhyming words. Additionally, provide a brief explanation of the cultural significance of bananas in at least two different regions of the world and how they are used in traditional cuisine. Please present your response in a table format that includes the alliteration, the rhyming words, and the cultural information. Finally, provide a code snippet that generates a randomized version of your alliteration and its corresponding cultural information."
