When I test the module using the script \"test.py\" from the module directory, I encounter an ImportError. Here's the output:\n\n```\n/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mpl_toolkits/basemap$ python test.py\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"test.py\", line 1, in <module>\nfrom mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap, shiftgrid\nImportError: No module named basemap\n```\n\nI notice that even though the \"basemap\" directory is present in the \"mpl_toolkits\" directory, which is a part of the `sys.path`, I still get the error. I tried manually adding the path as follows:\n\n```\n>>> import sys\n>>> sys.path.append('/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mpl_toolkits/basemap')\n>>> import basemap\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nFile \"basemap/__init__.py\", line 30, in <module>\nfrom mpl_toolkits.basemap import pyproj\nImportError: No module named basemap\n```\n\nI even tried uninstalling and reinstalling basemap from source, apt-get, and conda, while following the instructions mentioned [here](https://peak5390.wordpress.com/2012/12/08/matplotlib-basemap-tutorial-installing-matplotlib-and-basemap/), but to no avail. I am still not able to import basemap. Could you provide any guidance on how to resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with the Basemap library is not uncommon, especially when dealing with Python 2.7. Here are some steps and suggestions to help you resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Ensure Compatibility and Version:**\n   - Ensure that you are using a compatible Python version. Basemap is outdated, and Python 2.7 is deprecated. It is recommended to use Python 3.x.\n   - Consider using `conda` environments to manage different versions of Python and packages.\n\n2. **Install Basemap Properly:**\n   - If you are using `conda`, the easiest way to install Basemap is through the conda-forge channel:\n     ```bash\n     conda install -c conda-forge basemap\n     ```\n   - If you prefer to use `pip`, make sure to use Python 3 and first upgrade `pip`:\n     ```bash\n     pip install --upgrade pip\n     pip install basemap\n     ```\n\n3. **Check Dependencies:**\n   - Basemap has several dependencies, such as `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `pyproj`. Ensure all of these are installed and up to date.\n   - You can install them using `pip`:\n     ```bash\n     pip install numpy matplotlib pyproj\n     ```\n\n4. **Verify Installation:**\n   - After installation, verify that Basemap is installed correctly by running the following in a Python shell:\n     ```python\n     from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap\n     ```\n   - If you encounter errors, check for the specific missing module or error message.\n\n5. **Environment and Path:**\n   - Ensure that you are working in the correct virtual environment if you are using one.\n   - Avoid manually modifying `sys.path`. Instead, use virtual environments to manage dependencies.\n\n6. **Use Alternative Libraries:**\n   - If you continue facing issues, consider switching to `cartopy`, which is the recommended alternative for mapping in Python. It integrates well with `matplotlib` and is actively maintained:\n     ```bash\n     conda install -c conda-forge cartopy\n     ```\n\n7. **Debug and Log:**\n   - Check if there are any conflicting installations or if any custom modifications have been made to the library files.\n   - Use `pip list` or `conda list` to see all installed packages and their versions.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the import error with Basemap. Moving forward, transitioning to Python 3 and considering `cartopy` may provide better long-term support and functionality."
