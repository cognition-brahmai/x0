I used to be able to easily set up local interpreter to point anything installed on my machine in the earlier versions of PyCharm but now, I can't select my local Pyenv. I tried adding a `.python-version` file on the root of the project so that Pyenv virtualenv will activate and run the project with the correct environment automatically, but PyCharm still doesn't recognize the correct interpreter and throws import and syntax errors. I can't set the path as variable anymore and can only browse the path using a drop-down menu which doesn't show hidden files like the default path for pyenv `~./.pyenv/versions{project}`. What can I do to solve this?"

        "content": "To solve the issue of using Pyenv virtualenvs with PyCharm 2016.3, you can follow these steps to manually configure the interpreter:\n\n1. **Locate the Pyenv Virtual Environment:**\n   - First, ensure you know the exact path to the virtual environment that Pyenv has created. You can find it by running the following command in your terminal:\n     ```bash\n     pyenv virtualenvs\n     ```\n   - This will list all your virtual environments. Note down the path to the one you want to use.\n\n2. **Access Hidden Directories:**\n   - Since PyCharm might not display hidden directories by default, you can manually find your virtual environment's interpreter path. It's usually located at:\n     ```\n     ~/.pyenv/versions/{project_name}/bin/python\n     ```\n\n3. **Configure PyCharm to Use the Pyenv Virtual Environment:**\n   - Open your project in PyCharm.\n   - Go to `File` > `Settings` (or `PyCharm` > `Preferences` on macOS).\n   - In the left-hand pane, navigate to `Project: <your_project_name>` > `Python Interpreter`.\n   - Click on the gear icon next to the interpreter dropdown and select `Add...`.\n   - Choose `Existing environment`.\n   - Browse to the path of your pyenv virtual environment's `python` interpreter that you noted earlier.\n   - Click `OK` to add it.\n\n4. **Validate the Configuration:**\n   - Once you've added the correct interpreter, PyCharm should recognize it, and you should see a list of installed packages.\n   - Ensure your project SDK is set to the newly added interpreter by checking the project settings.\n\n5. **Test Your Configuration:**\n   - Open a terminal in PyCharm and run:\n     ```bash\n     python --version\n     ```\n   - This should display the Python version of your Pyenv virtual environment, confirming that it's correctly configured.\n\n6. **Check for Syntax and Import Errors:**\n   - After setting up the interpreter, rebuild your project and check if the import and syntax errors persist. They should be resolved if the correct interpreter is being used.\n\n7. **Update PyCharm if Possible:**\n   - If you continue to face issues, consider updating PyCharm to a more recent version, as newer versions often have better support for virtual environments and Python tools.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to effectively configure your Pyenv virtual environments with PyCharm and resolve any interpreter-related issues."
