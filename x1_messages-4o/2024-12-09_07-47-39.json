For that, I am executing a query to retrieve a single column of data using the following code:\n\n```python\nroutes_query = select(\n    [schema.stop_times.c.route_number],\n    schema.stop_times.c.stop_id == stop_id\n).distinct(schema.stop_times.c.route_number)\nresult = conn.execute(routes_query)\n\nreturn [r['route_number'] for r in result]\n```\n\nI am looking for a cleaner or more efficient way to retrieve a native list of the data rows returned. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can streamline your SQLAlchemy query to make it cleaner and more efficient. Here's a more modern approach using SQLAlchemy that avoids some deprecated practices and directly retrieves a list of results:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import select\n\n# Build the query\nroutes_query = (\n    select(schema.stop_times.c.route_number)\n    .where(schema.stop_times.c.stop_id == stop_id)\n    .distinct()\n)\n\n# Execute the query and fetch the results\nresult = conn.execute(routes_query).scalars().all()\n\n# Return the list of route numbers\nreturn result\n```\n\n### Key Improvements:\n\n1. **Modern Select Statement**: \n   - Use `select()` directly with the columns you want, instead of passing a list.\n\n2. **Where Clause**:\n   - Use the `.where()` method for filtering conditions instead of passing conditions as additional arguments to `select`.\n\n3. **Distinct**:\n   - Simply call `.distinct()` on the query to ensure distinct results.\n\n4. **Fetching Results**:\n   - Use `.scalars()` to fetch only the first element of each row, which is `route_number` in this case.\n   - Use `.all()` to retrieve all results as a list.\n\nThis approach is cleaner and aligns with the current SQLAlchemy best practices."
