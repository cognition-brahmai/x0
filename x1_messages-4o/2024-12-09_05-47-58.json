The two input images I'm working with can be found at these links: \n\n1. https://code.ros.org/trac/opencv/browser/trunk/opencv/samples/c/box.png?rev=2270\n2. https://code.ros.org/trac/opencv/browser/trunk/opencv/samples/c/box_in_scene.png?rev=2270\n\nThe issue I'm encountering is that most of the combined image is white, corresponding to where the individual images should be. The black area is where no image data was written. Why is all my image data being converted to white? Here's the code I'm using:\n\n```\nimport numpy as np, cv\n\nimg1 = cv.LoadImage(fn1, 0)\nimg2 = cv.LoadImage(fn2, 0)\n\nh1, w1 = img1.height,img1.width\nh2, w2 = img2.height,img2.width\n\n# Create an array big enough to hold both images next to each other.\nvis = np.zeros((max(h1, h2), w1+w2), np.float32)\n\nmat1 = cv.CreateMat(img1.height,img1.width, cv.CV_32FC1)\ncv.Convert( img1, mat1 )\n\nmat2 = cv.CreateMat(img2.height, img2.width, cv.CV_32FC1)\ncv.Convert( img2, mat2 )\n\n# Copy both images into the composite image.\nvis[:h1, :w1] = mat1\nvis[:h2, w1:w1+w2] = mat2\n\nh,w = vis.shape\nvis2 = cv.CreateMat(h, w, cv.CV_32FC3)\nvis0 = cv.fromarray(vis)\ncv.CvtColor(vis0, vis2, cv.CV_GRAY2BGR)\ncv.ShowImage('test', vis2)\ncv.WaitKey()\n```"

        "content": "Your issue with the images appearing mostly white is likely due to a mismatch in data type conversions and normalization. The code you provided is using OpenCV 2.1, which is quite outdated. Below is a revised version of your code, using a more modern approach with OpenCV 4 and Python. I'll also address potential issues that could arise from the code you shared.\n\nHere's a modified version of your code using OpenCV 4:\n\n```python\nimport cv2\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load images in grayscale\nimg1 = cv2.imread('box.png', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)\nimg2 = cv2.imread('box_in_scene.png', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)\n\n# Check if images were successfully loaded\nif img1 is None or img2 is None:\n    print(\"Error: One or both images couldn't be loaded.\")\n    exit(1)\n\n# Get dimensions of both images\nh1, w1 = img1.shape\nh2, w2 = img2.shape\n\n# Create an array big enough to hold both images\nvis = np.zeros((max(h1, h2), w1 + w2), np.uint8)\n\n# Copy both images into the composite image\nvis[:h1, :w1] = img1\nvis[:h2, w1:w1 + w2] = img2\n\n# Display the result\ncv2.imshow('Combined Image', vis)\ncv2.waitKey(0)\ncv2.destroyAllWindows()\n```\n\n### Key Modifications:\n\n1. **Use of OpenCV 4:** I switched to `cv2`, which is the module name in OpenCV 4. OpenCV 2.1 is outdated, and using a modern version is highly recommended for better support and functionality.\n\n2. **Grayscale Reading:** Images are directly read in grayscale using `cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE`, which simplifies the process by avoiding unnecessary conversions.\n\n3. **Data Type:** The images are stored in `np.uint8` format, which is typical for grayscale images. This prevents the issue you were facing with unintended white areas.\n\n4. **Error Checking:** Added a simple check to ensure both images are loaded correctly.\n\n5. **Simplified Display Function:** Used `cv2.imshow` and `cv2.waitKey` for displaying the image, which is the standard method in OpenCV 4.\n\nBy following these modifications, you should be able to correctly combine and display the images side by side without the issues you were encountering with the original code."
