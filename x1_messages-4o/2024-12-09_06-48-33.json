        "content": "The error you're encountering seems to be related to the use of `distutils` and `setuptools` in your Python environment. The error `AttributeError: module 'setuptools._distutils' has no attribute 'version'` indicates that the code is trying to access the `version` module from `distutils`, but it's not available in the expected place.\n\nHere's how you can address this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Correct Import**: Check if there's a conflict with how `distutils` is being imported in your environment. The error suggests that `torch.utils.tensorboard` is relying on `distutils.version`, but it's somehow redirected to `setuptools._distutils` which doesn't have the `version` attribute.\n\n2. **Update setuptools**: Make sure you have the latest version of `setuptools` installed, as this might resolve conflicts between `setuptools` and `distutils`.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade setuptools\n   ```\n\n3. **Use Standard distutils**: Ensure that the standard `distutils` is being used instead of `setuptools._distutils`. You can do this by explicitly importing `distutils` before any other imports that might change the import path.\n\n   ```python\n   import distutils.version\n   from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter\n   ```\n\n4. **Check TensorFlow Version**: Ensure that the TensorFlow version you're using is compatible with your version of Python and other dependencies.\n\n5. **Alternative Solution**: If the issue persists, you might consider switching to a different environment manager like `conda` or setting up a virtual environment that isolates the dependencies more effectively.\n\n6. **Direct Import of LooseVersion**: Instead of relying on `distutils`, you can directly import `LooseVersion` from `pkg_resources` if it's available. This is a workaround but could help avoid the conflict.\n\n   ```python\n   from pkg_resources import parse_version as LooseVersion\n   ```\n\n7. **Check for Environment Issues**: Sometimes, conflicting installations or corrupted environments can cause unexpected behavior. Consider creating a fresh virtual environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\\Scripts\\activate`\n   pip install torch tensorflow\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `AttributeError` and proceed with training your model using TensorBoard."
