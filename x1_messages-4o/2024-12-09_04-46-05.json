Can someone explain this?"

        "content": "In PyTorch, the `cross_entropy` loss function combines `log_softmax` and `nll_loss` in one single function. This function is typically used for classification problems and expects the output logits from a model (not probabilities) and the target labels.\n\nLet's break down your code and understand the reason for the non-zero loss:\n\n1. **Logits vs. Probabilities**: \n   - The input to the `cross_entropy` function should be raw logits, not probabilities. In your case, the input `x` is not logits, but a one-hot encoded matrix. Logits are the raw, unnormalized scores outputted by the final layer of a neural network, which are then usually transformed into probabilities using a softmax function.\n\n2. **Understanding the Loss Calculation**:\n   - The `cross_entropy` function first applies a `softmax` to convert logits into probabilities. Then it uses these probabilities to compute the negative log likelihood loss. If the input is perfectly matching the target, the logits would ideally be very high for the correct class and very low for the others, leading to near-zero loss.\n   - In your case, since you have one-hot encoded vectors, these do not translate to high-confidence logits when passed directly to `cross_entropy`, because the softmax of these vectors will not produce high probabilities for the correct classes unless they are large positive numbers.\n\n3. **Why the Non-Zero Loss**:\n   - The `cross_entropy` function applies a softmax, and due to the nature of exponentiation within softmax, even a single 1.0 in a one-hot encoded vector does not translate into a high probability for that class. The vector `[1.0, 0.0, 0.0]` will become approximately `[0.576, 0.212, 0.212]` after softmax, not `[1.0, 0.0, 0.0]`.\n   - The loss is computed based on these resulting probabilities, which don't perfectly match the expected output.\n\nTo achieve a zero loss, your input logits should be such that when softmax is applied, they produce very high probabilities (close to 1) for the correct class and very low probabilities (close to 0) for the incorrect classes. For instance, a vector like `[10.0, 0.0, 0.0]` would produce a much higher probability for the first class after softmax.\n\nIf you want to test the `cross_entropy` function with perfect predictions, ensure your logits are much larger in magnitude for the correct class compared to the others."
