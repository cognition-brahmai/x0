If you have a method named `helloWorld` that takes two parameters, you would call it like this:\n\n```ruby\nhelloWorld(arg1, arg2)\n```\n\nHere, `arg1` and `arg2` are the arguments you want to pass to the method. Replace them with the actual values or variables you wish to use when calling the method. If the method is defined within a class or module, you may need to call it on an instance of the class or include/extend the module, depending on its context."
