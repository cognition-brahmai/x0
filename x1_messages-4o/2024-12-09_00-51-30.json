I have my KMeans and three clusters stored, and I am attempting to use the Dunn Index to measure the performance of my clustering. I am using the jqm_cvi package for this purpose. However, I want to know if there is any clustering internal evaluation that already exists in Scikit Learn, apart from the silhouette_score. Are there other well-known libraries I can use for this purpose? Here is my code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn import datasets\n\n#loading the dataset\niris = datasets.load_iris()\ndf = pd.DataFrame(iris.data)\n\n#K-Means\nfrom sklearn import cluster\nk_means = cluster.KMeans(n_clusters=3)\nk_means.fit(df) #K-means training\ny_pred = k_means.predict(df)\n\n#We store the K-means results in a dataframe\npred = pd.DataFrame(y_pred)\npred.columns = ['Species']\n\n#we merge this dataframe with df\nprediction = pd.concat([df,pred], axis = 1)\n\n#We store the clusters\nclus0 = prediction.loc[prediction.Species == 0]\nclus1 = prediction.loc[prediction.Species == 1]\nclus2 = prediction.loc[prediction.Species == 2]\nk_list = [clus0.values, clus1.values,clus2.values]\n\nfrom jqmcvi import base\nbase.dunn(k_list)\n```"

        "content": "In addition to the `silhouette_score`, Scikit-learn provides several other metrics for evaluating the quality of clustering results. Some of these metrics are designed to assess the compactness and separation of clusters, while others are intended for supervised evaluation, where you have true labels available. Here are some internal evaluation metrics you can use:\n\n1. **Calinski-Harabasz Index**:\n   - Measures the ratio of the sum of between-cluster dispersion and within-cluster dispersion. Higher values indicate better-defined clusters.\n   - You can use it as follows:\n     ```python\n     from sklearn.metrics import calinski_harabasz_score\n     ch_score = calinski_harabasz_score(df, y_pred)\n     ```\n\n2. **Davies-Bouldin Index**:\n   - Measures the average similarity ratio of each cluster with its most similar cluster. Lower values indicate better separation between clusters.\n   - You can use it as follows:\n     ```python\n     from sklearn.metrics import davies_bouldin_score\n     db_score = davies_bouldin_score(df, y_pred)\n     ```\n\nRegarding other libraries, you can explore:\n\n1. **Yellowbrick**:\n   - A visual analysis tool for machine learning that includes visualizations for clustering evaluation, like the elbow method, silhouette plots, and more.\n   - You can install it using `pip install yellowbrick` and use it for visual evaluation.\n\n2. **PyClustering**:\n   - Offers a variety of clustering algorithms and quality metrics, including the Dunn index and others.\n   - You can install it using `pip install pyclustering`.\n\n3. **Scipy**:\n   - While not focused solely on clustering, it includes hierarchical clustering methods and can be used to calculate some clustering metrics.\n\nThese tools and metrics can help you evaluate your clustering results from different perspectives, providing a more comprehensive understanding of your model's performance."
