        "content": "In the realm of mobile application development, expertise in programming languages that are compatible with the operating system is crucial. Android app developers typically use either Java or Kotlin, both of which have their own unique characteristics. Java is an object-oriented language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine, boasting a simple syntax, while Kotlin is a concise language that supports functional programming. Conversely, iOS app developers utilize either Swift, a powerful language developed by Apple, or Objective-C, an older language still in use. Swift is a compiled language with a wide range of modern features such as optionals, closures, and generics, making it a popular choice among developers for its high performance. Objective-C, on the other hand, has a more intricate syntax but lacks the modern features of Swift. \nFor the Android code snippet below, the programming language used is clearly stated in the text. However, can you identify which programming language is used in the following code snippet? \n```\npublic class MyActivity extends AppCompatActivity {\n    @Override\n    protected void onStart() {\n        super.onStart();\n        System.out.println(\"Hello World!\");\n    }\n}\n```\nNote that the programming language in question is one of the four mentioned earlier. Good luck!"

The use of `public class`, which is a common Java syntax for defining a class.\n2. The `extends` keyword indicates inheritance, a feature of object-oriented programming in Java.\n3. The `@Override` annotation, which is used in Java to indicate that a method is overriding a method in a superclass.\n4. The method `System.out.println(\"Hello World!\");`, which is a standard way to print to the console in Java.\n\nAll these elements are indicative of Java, one of the languages commonly used for Android app development."
