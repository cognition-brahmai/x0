        "content": "Creating a cumulative frequency distribution table involves several steps. Here's a detailed explanation of the process, using an example list of numbers, and how it can be applied in real-world scenarios:\n\n### Step 1: Organize the Data\n\n1. **Collect the Data**: Begin with a list of numbers. For example: [5, 7, 8, 5, 6, 9, 8, 7, 6, 10, 12, 11, 13, 9, 8].\n\n2. **Sort the Data**: Arrange the data in ascending order. For example: [5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].\n\n### Step 2: Determine Class Intervals\n\n1. **Choose the Number of Classes**: The Sturges' formula can be used to determine the number of classes: \\( k = 1 + 3.322 \\log_{10}(n) \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of data points. For our example with 15 data points, \\( k \\approx 5 \\).\n\n2. **Determine Class Width**: Subtract the smallest number from the largest number, and divide by the number of classes to find the class width. Here, the range is \\( 13 - 5 = 8 \\), and the class width is \\( \\frac{8}{5} \\approx 1.6 \\). Round up to 2 for simplicity.\n\n3. **Define Class Intervals**: Begin from the smallest number and add the class width. For example: [5-6, 7-8, 9-10, 11-12, 13-14].\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Frequencies\n\n1. **Tally the Data**: For each class interval, count how many data points fall within the interval.\n\n2. **Record Frequencies**: Create a frequency column. For example:\n   - 5-6: 4\n   - 7-8: 5\n   - 9-10: 3\n   - 11-12: 2\n   - 13-14: 1\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Cumulative Frequencies\n\n1. **Calculate Cumulative Frequency**: Start from the first frequency and add each successive frequency cumulatively.\n   - 5-6: 4\n   - 7-8: 4 + 5 = 9\n   - 9-10: 9 + 3 = 12\n   - 11-12: 12 + 2 = 14\n   - 13-14: 14 + 1 = 15\n\n### Step 5: Determine Relative Frequencies\n\n1. **Calculate Relative Frequencies**: Divide each frequency by the total number of data points, then multiply by 100 to get percentages.\n   - 5-6: \\( \\frac{4}{15} \\times 100 \\approx 26.67\\% \\)\n   - 7-8: \\( \\frac{5}{15} \\times 100 \\approx 33.33\\% \\)\n   - 9-10: \\( \\frac{3}{15} \\times 100 \\approx 20.00\\% \\)\n   - 11-12: \\( \\frac{2}{15} \\times 100 \\approx 13.33\\% \\)\n   - 13-14: \\( \\frac{1}{15} \\times 100 \\approx 6.67\\% \\)\n\n### Step 6: Represent in a Tabular Format\n\n| Class Interval | Frequency | Cumulative Frequency | Relative Frequency (%) |\n|----------------|-----------|----------------------|------------------------|\n| 5-6            | 4         | 4                    | 26.67                  |\n| 7-8            | 5         | 9                    | 33.33                  |\n| 9-10           | 3         | 12                   | 20.00                  |\n| 11-12          | 2         | 14                   | 13.33                  |\n| 13-14          | 1         | 15                   | 6.67                   |\n\n### Real-World Applications\n\nCumulative frequency distribution tables are invaluable in various fields to analyze large data sets:\n\n1. **Market Research**: Understanding consumer trends by categorizing income levels, age groups, or product preferences.\n\n2. **Public Health**: Analyzing the distribution of health-related metrics, such as BMI or blood pressure ranges within a population.\n\n3. **Education**: Evaluating student performance by categorizing scores into grade ranges to identify trends and areas needing improvement.\n\n4. **Quality Control**: Monitoring manufacturing processes by analyzing defect rates within different categories to improve quality and reduce waste.\n\nBy organizing data into cumulative frequency distribution tables, businesses and organizations can interpret complex data sets more effectively, identify trends, and make informed decisions. This method enhances accuracy by providing a clearer picture of how data points are distributed across different intervals."
