        "content": "Certainly! Below is a simple Java function that calculates the area of a rectangle given its width and height:\n\n```java\npublic class RectangleAreaCalculator {\n    // Function to calculate the area of a rectangle\n    public static double calculateArea(double width, double height) {\n        return width * height;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        double width = 5.0;\n        double height = 10.0;\n        \n        double area = calculateArea(width, height);\n        System.out.println(\"The area of the rectangle is: \" + area);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- The `calculateArea` method takes two parameters, `width` and `height`, both of type `double`.\n- It returns the area of the rectangle by multiplying these two parameters.\n- The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `calculateArea` function with sample values for width and height. You can change these values as needed."
