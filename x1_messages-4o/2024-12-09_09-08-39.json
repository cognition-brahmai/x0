Here's a simple example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nclass User:\n    def __init__(self, name, age):\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n\n    def display_info(self):\n        print(f\"Name: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}\")\n\n# Example usage:\nuser1 = User(\"Alice\", 30)\nuser1.display_info()  # Output: Name: Alice, Age: 30\n\nuser2 = User(\"Bob\", 25)\nuser2.display_info()  # Output: Name: Bob, Age: 25\n```\n\nIn this example, the `User` class has an `__init__` method, which is the constructor that initializes the `name` and `age` attributes for each instance of the class. The `display_info` method is used to print out the user's name and age. You can create instances of the `User` class for different users and store their respective names and ages."
