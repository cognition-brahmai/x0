        "content": "To optimize a cost function in Python, you can use several libraries that provide optimization functionalities. One of the most popular libraries for this purpose is SciPy, which includes a module called `optimize`. A common function signature used for optimization in SciPy is `scipy.optimize.minimize`. Here's a basic example of how the function signature might look:\n\n```python\nimport scipy.optimize as opt\n\nresult = opt.minimize(\n    fun,               # The objective function to be minimized.\n    x0,                # Initial guess for the variables.\n    args=(),           # Extra arguments passed to the objective function.\n    method=None,       # The optimization method to use (e.g., 'BFGS', 'CG', 'L-BFGS-B').\n    jac=None,          # Jacobian (gradient) of the objective function.\n    hess=None,         # Hessian (second derivatives) of the objective function.\n    hessp=None,        # Hessian of the objective function times an arbitrary vector p.\n    bounds=None,       # Bounds for variables (only for certain methods like 'L-BFGS-B').\n    constraints=(),    # Constraints definition (only for certain methods like 'SLSQP').\n    tol=None,          # Tolerance for termination.\n    callback=None,     # Function called after each iteration.\n    options=None       # A dictionary of solver options.\n)\n```\n\nHere is a brief explanation of some key parameters:\n\n- `fun`: The objective function to be minimized. This function should take a 1-D array as input and return a scalar.\n- `x0`: Initial guess for the variables. It should be a 1-D array.\n- `method`: The optimization algorithm to use. Popular choices include `'BFGS'`, `'CG'`, `'L-BFGS-B'`, and `'SLSQP'`.\n- `jac`: The gradient (first derivative) of the objective function. If `None`, SciPy will approximate it.\n- `bounds`: Used to specify variable bounds for methods that support it.\n- `constraints`: Used to specify constraints for methods that support it.\n\nOnce you call `opt.minimize`, it returns an optimization result object, which contains information about the solution, including the optimized parameter values, the value of the objective function at the optimum, and whether the optimizer converged successfully."
