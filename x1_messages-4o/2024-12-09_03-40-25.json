        "content": "To find the intersection point of two lines given their endpoints in Python, you can use the concept of line equations. Let's assume you have the following endpoints:\n\n- Line 1: A = [x1, y1] and B = [x2, y2]\n- Line 2: C = [x3, y3] and D = [x4, y4]\n\nThe lines are represented by the equations of the form:\n\n\\[ (y - y1) = m1 \\times (x - x1) \\]\n\\[ (y - y3) = m2 \\times (x - x3) \\]\n\nHere, \\( m1 \\) and \\( m2 \\) are the slopes of line 1 and line 2, respectively. They can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ m1 = \\frac{y2 - y1}{x2 - x1} \\]\n\\[ m2 = \\frac{y4 - y3}{x4 - x3} \\]\n\nFor the intersection point, we'll solve the system of equations defined by these two lines. The intersection point can be found by solving:\n\n\\[ m1 \\times (x - x1) = m2 \\times (x - x3) + (y3 - y1) \\]\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_intersection_point(A, B, C, D):\n    x1, y1 = A\n    x2, y2 = B\n    x3, y3 = C\n    x4, y4 = D\n\n    # Calculate the slopes\n    if x2 - x1 == 0:  # Vertical line 1\n        x_intersect = x1\n        y_intersect = (y3 - y4) / (x3 - x4) * (x_intersect - x3) + y3\n    elif x4 - x3 == 0:  # Vertical line 2\n        x_intersect = x3\n        y_intersect = (y1 - y2) / (x1 - x2) * (x_intersect - x1) + y1\n    else:\n        m1 = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n        m2 = (y4 - y3) / (x4 - x3)\n\n        if m1 == m2:\n            raise ValueError(\"The lines are parallel and do not intersect.\")\n        \n        # Calculate the intersection point\n        x_intersect = ((m1 * x1 - y1) - (m2 * x3 - y3)) / (m1 - m2)\n        y_intersect = m1 * (x_intersect - x1) + y1\n\n    return [x_intersect, y_intersect]\n\n# Example usage:\nA = [1, 2]\nB = [3, 4]\nC = [1, 4]\nD = [3, 2]\nintersection = find_intersection_point(A, B, C, D)\nprint(\"The intersection point is:\", intersection)\n```\n\nIn this code, the function `find_intersection_point` calculates the intersection point, taking into account vertical lines and checking if the lines are parallel. You can replace the example coordinates with your actual line endpoints to get the intersection point."
