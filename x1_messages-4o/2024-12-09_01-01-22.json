        "content": "In Python, you cannot use an assignment inside a conditional statement using the `=` operator directly, as you might in some other languages like C or JavaScript. The `=` operator is used for assignment in Python, and it does not return a value, which means you can't use it in a conditional expression like `if`.\n\nHowever, Python 3.8 introduced the \"walrus operator\" (`:=`), which allows you to assign a value to a variable as part of an expression. This operator can be used inside a conditional statement. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nif (a := some_func()):\n    # Use a\n```\n\nIn this example, `some_func()` is called, and its return value is assigned to `a`. If the return value is truthy, the block of code inside the `if` statement will be executed. This makes the code more concise and can be useful in certain situations where you want to both assign and check a value in one line."
