        "content": "When setting up Sublime Text for Python/Django development, you have a few good options for code completion and environment enhancement. Let's take a look at the options you've mentioned:\n\n1. **SublimeCodeIntel**: This is a popular plugin that provides code intelligence and autocompletion for many languages, including Python. It works well for general Python development, but it might not be specialized enough for Django-specific needs.\n\n2. **SublimeJEDI**: This plugin is specifically designed for Python and provides powerful autocompletion and code navigation features. It's based on the Jedi library, which is known for its accuracy in Python code completion. This could be a great choice if you're focused on Python.\n\n3. **Djaneiro**: This is a Django-specific plugin. It doesn't provide code completion but offers snippets and shortcuts for Django templates and models, making it a valuable companion for Django development.\n\n4. **SublimeRope**: This plugin offers Python refactoring and some code intelligence features. However, it might not be as actively maintained or feature-rich as SublimeJEDI when it comes to autocompletion.\n\nFor the best experience in Python/Django development with Sublime Text, you might consider using a combination of plugins:\n\n- **SublimeJEDI** for Python autocompletion and code navigation.\n- **Djaneiro** for Django-specific snippets and shortcuts.\n- Optionally, **SublimeCodeIntel** if you find it integrates well with your workflow.\n\nThis combination will cover general Python development, Django-specific needs, and offer a comprehensive development environment. Additionally, make sure to keep your Sublime Text updated and check for any new plugins that might enhance your development experience further."
