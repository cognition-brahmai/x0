Specifically, I have a function that looks like this:\n\n```python\ndef get_selected_index(self):\n    (path, column) = self._tree_view.get_cursor()\n    return path[0]\n```\nMy IDE is complaining that 'column' is an unused variable. I'm not interested in the second item in the tuple and want to discard the reference to it when it's unpacked. How can I rewrite this function to avoid this issue?"

The underscore is a common convention for indicating that a variable is intentionally unused. Here's how you can rewrite your function:\n\n```python\ndef get_selected_index(self):\n    path, _ = self._tree_view.get_cursor()\n    return path[0]\n```\n\nBy using an underscore, you indicate that you don't plan to use the `column` variable, and this should prevent your IDE from complaining about an unused variable."
