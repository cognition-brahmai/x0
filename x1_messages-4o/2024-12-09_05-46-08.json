However, the pandas' groupby function seems to group Series by its index. How can I modify it to group by value instead? I tried the code below but it didn't work as expected:\n\n```python\ngrouped = s.groupby(lambda x: x.date())\n```"

        "content": "To group a Pandas Series of Timestamps by date, you need to ensure you're grouping by the values of the Series, not its index. The lambda function in your `groupby` call is currently applied to the index, which is why it's not working as expected. Instead, you should directly access the `.dt` accessor to extract the date part from the Timestamp values. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample data\ns = pd.Series(pd.to_datetime(['2023-10-01 08:45', '2023-10-01 12:30', \n                              '2023-10-02 09:00', '2023-10-02 14:15', \n                              '2023-10-03 11:00']))\n\n# Group by the date part of the Timestamp\ngrouped = s.groupby(s.dt.date)\n\n# You can iterate through the groups and print them or process them as needed\nfor date, group in grouped:\n    print(f\"Date: {date}\")\n    print(group)\n```\n\nIn this code, `s.dt.date` extracts the date part of each Timestamp in the Series, which is then used as the key for grouping. This way, you are grouping based on the actual values (dates) in the Series rather than the index."
