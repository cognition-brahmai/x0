You can only use the number 7 to calculate the total cost. You can use it as many times as you want, but you can only use basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. \nFor example, if the airfare is $700, the hotel stay is $2100, the food expenses are $350, and the entertainment expenses are $1050, you need to calculate the total cost using only the number 7 and basic mathematical operations. Can you figure it out?"

        "content": "To calculate the total cost of the trip using only the number 7 and basic mathematical operations, we need to represent each expense using combinations of 7, then sum them up.\n\nGiven:\n- Airfare: $700\n- Hotel stay: $2100\n- Food expenses: $350\n- Entertainment expenses: $1050\n\nLet's break each down:\n\n1. **Airfare: $700**\n   - \\( 700 = 7 \\times 100 \\)\n\n2. **Hotel stay: $2100**\n   - \\( 2100 = 7 \\times 300 \\)\n\n3. **Food expenses: $350**\n   - \\( 350 = 7 \\times 50 \\)\n\n4. **Entertainment expenses: $1050**\n   - \\( 1050 = 7 \\times 150 \\)\n\nNow, calculate the total cost by summing up these expressions:\n\n\\[\n700 + 2100 + 350 + 1050 = (7 \\times 100) + (7 \\times 300) + (7 \\times 50) + (7 \\times 150)\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n7 \\times (100 + 300 + 50 + 150)\n\\]\n\nCalculate inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[\n100 + 300 + 50 + 150 = 600\n\\]\n\nThus, the total cost is:\n\n\\[\n7 \\times 600 = 4200\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the trip using only the number 7 and basic mathematical operations is $4200."
