        "content": "In Python, you can define the string representation of a class and its instances by implementing the `__str__` and/or `__repr__` methods in the class definition. The `__str__` method is used to define the \"informal\" or \"nicely printable\" string representation of an object, which is what gets returned when you use the `print()` function on an instance of the class. The `__repr__` method is meant to provide an \"official\" string representation of the object that can ideally be used to recreate the object using `eval()`.\n\nFor your specific requirement of printing the 'a' value when you print an instance of the `Test` class, you can implement the `__str__` method in the class. Here's how you can modify the `Test` class:\n\n```python\nclass Test:\n    def __init__(self, a):\n        self.a = a\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return str(self.a)\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"Test(a={self.a})\"\n\n# Example usage:\ntest_instance = Test(42)\nprint(test_instance)  # This will print: 42\n```\n\nIn this modified version of the `Test` class:\n\n- The `__str__` method returns the string representation of the `a` attribute, which means that when you use `print(test_instance)`, it will output the value of `a`.\n- The `__repr__` method is also implemented to provide a more detailed representation of the object, which is helpful for debugging. It outputs something like `Test(a=42)`, which can be useful when inspecting objects in interactive sessions."
