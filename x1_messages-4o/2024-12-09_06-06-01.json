        "content": "The error message you're encountering is due to adding a non-nullable ForeignKey field (`user`) to the `VideoData` model without specifying a default value. When you add a new field to an existing table in the database, Django needs to know what value to set for existing rows.\n\nHere's how you can address this issue:\n\n1. **Add a Default Value**: You can add a default value for the `user` field. However, this approach might not be appropriate if you don't have a specific default user in mind.\n\n2. **Allow Null Values**: You can modify the `user` field to allow null values temporarily, which will allow you to create the field without setting a default value for existing rows. After running the migration, you can update the existing records to set the appropriate user and then make the field non-nullable again if needed.\n\n3. **Set Existing Records Manually**: You can create a migration that sets the `user` field for all existing records manually.\n\nHere's how you can modify your model to allow null values initially:\n\n```python\nclass VideoData(Model):\n    video = models.CharField(max_length=40)\n    time  = models.IntegerField()\n    user = models.ForeignKey(User, null=True, blank=True, related_name='User')\n    class Meta:\n        verbose_name = 'User_Video MetaData'\n```\n\nAfter applying this migration, you can populate the `user` field for existing records, and then remove the `null=True, blank=True` options if you want to make it non-nullable again.\n\nTo apply these changes:\n\n1. Run `python manage.py makemigrations` to create a migration file.\n2. Run `python manage.py migrate` to apply the migration.\n3. Update the existing `VideoData` records with the appropriate `user`.\n4. If needed, remove `null=True, blank=True` from the `user` field and run the migrations again to enforce non-nullability."
