However, I am moving to Python 3 and I am struggling to find a Python 3 version of this code. I have searched online for Python 3 examples but unfortunately, I keep getting Python 2 versions. Can you provide the Python 3 version of this string formatting?"

        "content": "Certainly! In Python 3, you have several ways to format strings, each with its own advantages. The most modern and recommended way is to use f-strings, which were introduced in Python 3.6. Here's how you can format your string using f-strings:\n\n```python\nself.goals = 3  # Example value\nself.penalties = 15000  # Example value\n\nformatted_string = f\"({self.goals} goals, ${self.penalties})\"\nprint(formatted_string)\n```\n\nIn this example, the variables `self.goals` and `self.penalties` are directly embedded into the string using curly braces `{}`. This approach is concise and easy to read.\n\nIf you're using a version of Python 3 that is older than 3.6, you can use the `str.format()` method:\n\n```python\nself.goals = 3  # Example value\nself.penalties = 15000  # Example value\n\nformatted_string = \"({} goals, ${})\".format(self.goals, self.penalties)\nprint(formatted_string)\n```\n\nBoth methods will give you the same result, but f-strings are generally preferred for their simplicity and readability."
