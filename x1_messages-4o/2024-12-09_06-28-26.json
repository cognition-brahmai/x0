However, I'm encountering an issue where everything after the decimal point zeroes out. Here's the function I've written:\n\n```python\ndef size_format(b):\n    if b < 1000:\n        return '%i' % b + 'B'\n    elif 1000 <= b < 1000000:\n        return '%.1f' % float(b/1000) + 'KB'\n    elif 1000000 <= b < 1000000000:\n        return '%.1f' % float(b/1000000) + 'MB'\n    elif 1000000000 <= b < 1000000000000:\n        return '%.1f' % float(b/1000000000) + 'GB'\n    elif 1000000000000 <= b:\n        return '%.1f' % float(b/1000000000000) + 'TB'\n```\n\nFor example, `size_format(623)` returns `'623B'` as expected, but `size_format(6200)` returns `'6.0kb'` instead of '6.2kb'. Why is this happening?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the way you're formatting the string using the `%.1f` format specifier. This format specifier rounds the number to one decimal place, which is why you're getting `'6.0KB'` instead of `'6.2KB'`. The problem is not with the rounding itself but with the division operation. You're using integer division when dividing `b` by `1000`, `1000000`, etc., which causes the result to be an integer before formatting.\n\nTo fix the issue, make sure you're performing floating-point division by casting either the numerator or the denominator to a float. Here's an updated version of your function:\n\n```python\ndef size_format(b):\n    if b < 1000:\n        return f'{b}B'\n    elif 1000 <= b < 1000000:\n        return f'{b / 1000:.1f}KB'\n    elif 1000000 <= b < 1000000000:\n        return f'{b / 1000000:.1f}MB'\n    elif 1000000000 <= b < 1000000000000:\n        return f'{b / 1000000000:.1f}GB'\n    elif 1000000000000 <= b:\n        return f'{b / 1000000000000:.1f}TB'\n\n# Example usage\nprint(size_format(623))       # Output: 623B\nprint(size_format(6200))      # Output: 6.2KB\n```\n\nBy using floating-point division explicitly, you ensure that the division operation results in a floating-point number, and the formatted output will retain the expected decimal precision."
