I am working on a Ubuntu 16.04 system with PyCharm Community 2018.1.2, Python 2.7/3.5, Keras 2.2.0, and Tensorflow-GPU 1.8.0. I've observed in many codes that people use 'K.clear_session()' or delete the model after using it, as shown below:\n\n```python\nfrom keras import backend as K \n\n# Do some code, e.g. train and save model\n\nK.clear_session()\n\n# or\n\ndel model\n```\n\nThe Keras documentation explains that 'clear_session' destroys the current TF graph and creates a new one to avoid clutter from old models or layers. I am curious to understand the purpose of this and whether I should adopt this as well. Given that loading or creating a new model overwrites my model anyway, is there a specific benefit to doing this?"

        "content": "Using `K.clear_session()` in Keras is a best practice, especially when you're working in environments where you might be creating and training multiple models sequentially, such as in a loop or in a Jupyter notebook. Here's why it's beneficial:\n\n1. **Memory Management:** Each model you create in Keras is associated with a TensorFlow computational graph. Over time, if you create multiple models without clearing the session, these graphs can accumulate, consuming more memory and potentially leading to out-of-memory errors. This is particularly relevant when working with large models or limited GPU resources.\n\n2. **Avoiding Graph Contamination:** When you run operations in TensorFlow, they are added to the current default graph. This can lead to unexpected behavior if you accidentally add layers or operations to an unintended graph. Clearing the session ensures that your new model starts with a clean state, preventing such contamination.\n\n3. **Resource Cleanup:** Clearing the session helps in releasing the resources associated with the previous model, such as file handles and memory buffers, which is important for maintaining the stability of long-running applications.\n\n4. **Consistency in Iterative Processes:** If you're running experiments or training multiple models in a loop, clearing the session ensures that each iteration starts fresh, avoiding any unintended carryover effects from previous iterations.\n\nEven though loading or creating a new model overwrites the previous model, the underlying computational graph and resources may still linger unless explicitly cleared. Therefore, incorporating `K.clear_session()` is a good habit to adopt for better resource management and cleaner code execution.\n\nIn summary, while it might not always be necessary, using `K.clear_session()` is a proactive measure to ensure that your code runs efficiently and avoids potential pitfalls associated with resource management in TensorFlow."
