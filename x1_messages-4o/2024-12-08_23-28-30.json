        "content": "Your Ruby code for calculating the percentage increase in demand for renewable energy sources is almost correct, but there's a small mistake in the calculation. You need to ensure that you are dividing by the initial value as a float to get an accurate percentage increase. Here is the corrected Ruby code:\n\n```ruby\nsolar_increase = ((500 - 100) / 100.0) * 100\nwind_increase = ((800 - 200) / 200.0) * 100\ngeothermal_increase = ((200 - 50) / 50.0) * 100\n\nputs \"The percentage increase in solar energy demand is #{solar_increase}%\"\nputs \"The percentage increase in wind energy demand is #{wind_increase}%\"\nputs \"The percentage increase in geothermal energy demand is #{geothermal_increase}%\"\n```\n\nBy dividing by `100.0`, `200.0`, and `50.0` (instead of `100`, `200`, and `50`), you ensure that the division operation is performed as floating-point division, which gives you the correct percentage increase."
