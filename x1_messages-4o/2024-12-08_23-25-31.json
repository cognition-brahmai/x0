If the remaining balance is equal to the initial deposit, how much money did John deposit initially? \nNote: Assume simple interest is used and that the interest is compounded annually. You do not need to provide any code for this puzzle."

        "content": "To solve this problem, let's denote the initial deposit as \\( P \\). Since the interest is compounded annually at a simple interest rate of 6%, the interest earned each year is \\( 0.06 \\times P \\).\n\nAfter one year, the total amount in the account would be:\n\\[ P + 0.06P = 1.06P \\]\n\nAfter two years, the total amount, including interest, would be:\n\\[ 1.06P + 0.06P = 1.12P \\]\n\nJohn then withdraws $240, and the remaining balance equals the initial deposit \\( P \\). Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 1.12P - 240 = P \\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( P \\):\n\\[ 1.12P - P = 240 \\]\n\\[ 0.12P = 240 \\]\n\\[ P = \\frac{240}{0.12} \\]\n\\[ P = 2000 \\]\n\nThus, John initially deposited $2000."
