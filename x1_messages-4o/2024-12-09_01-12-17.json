        "content": "The behavior you're observing is actually expected when using the `Tokenizer` with the `num_words` parameter. The `num_words` parameter in the Keras `Tokenizer` limits the number of words that will be used when converting texts to sequences, but it does not limit the number of words stored in the `word_index`. The `word_index` will always contain all the unique words found in the texts fitted, regardless of the `num_words` parameter.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. When you call `fit_on_texts`, the tokenizer creates a complete vocabulary from the input texts and assigns an index to each unique word based on its frequency (high frequency words have lower indices).\n\n2. The `num_words` parameter is used later, during the text-to-sequence conversion, to keep only the top `num_words - 1` most frequent words (since the index starts at 1). Any word with an index equal to or higher than `num_words` will be ignored during this conversion.\n\nIf you want to see the top `num_words` words based on frequency, you can sort the `word_index` by value (i.e., by index) and take the first `num_words - 1` words. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer\n\nt = Tokenizer(num_words=3)\nl = [\"Hello, World! This is so&amp;#$ fantastic!\", \"There is no other world like this one\"]\nt.fit_on_texts(l)\n\n# Get the sorted list of words based on their index\nsorted_words = sorted(t.word_index.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n# Get the top num_words - 1 words\ntop_words = [word for word, index in sorted_words if index < 3]\ntop_words\n```\n\nThis will give you the top 2 words, as `num_words=3` means you want to keep the top 2 most frequent words (because the indexing starts from 1)."
