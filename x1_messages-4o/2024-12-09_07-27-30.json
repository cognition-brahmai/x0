Here is the current implementation:\n\n```python\nfunctions = []\n\nfor i in range(3):\n    def f():\n        return i\n\n    # alternatively: f = lambda: i\n\n    functions.append(f)\n```\nHowever, I'm encountering an issue: all functions end up being the same. Instead of returning 0, 1, and 2, all three functions return 2. When I run this code:\n\n```python\nprint([f() for f in functions])\n# expected output: [0, 1, 2]\n# actual output:   [2, 2, 2]\n```\nI'm expecting an output of [0, 1, 2], but the actual output is [2, 2, 2]. Why is this happening, and what should I do to get 3 different functions that output 0, 1, and 2 respectively?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to how closures capture variables in Python. When you define a function inside a loop, the function captures the variable `i` itself, not its value at the time the function was created. Therefore, when you call any of the functions later, they all refer to the final value of `i` after the loop ends, which in this case is `2`.\n\nTo achieve the expected behavior, you can use a default argument in your function definition. This way, the current value of `i` is captured at each iteration of the loop. Here's how you can modify your implementation:\n\n```python\nfunctions = []\n\nfor i in range(3):\n    def f(i=i):  # Use i as a default argument\n        return i\n\n    functions.append(f)\n\nprint([f() for f in functions])  # Output: [0, 1, 2]\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use a lambda function inside another function to capture the current value of `i`:\n\n```python\nfunctions = []\n\nfor i in range(3):\n    def make_function(i):\n        return lambda: i\n\n    functions.append(make_function(i))\n\nprint([f() for f in functions])  # Output: [0, 1, 2]\n```\n\nBoth approaches ensure that each function captures the value of `i` at the time the function was created, giving you the desired output of `[0, 1, 2]`."
