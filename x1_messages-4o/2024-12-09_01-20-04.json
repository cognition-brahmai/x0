        "content": "To modify your `setup.py` script to cythonize multiple `.pyx` files, you can use a list to specify the filenames or use a wildcard to include all `.pyx` files in a specified folder. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Specifying Multiple Files by Name:\nIf you want to cythonize specific `.pyx` files by name, you can list them in the `cythonize` function:\n\n```python\nfrom distutils.core import setup\nfrom Cython.Build import cythonize\n\n# List the .pyx files you want to compile\npyx_files = [\"MyFile1.pyx\", \"MyFile2.pyx\", \"MyFile3.pyx\"]\n\nsetup(\n    ext_modules = cythonize(pyx_files)\n)\n```\n\n### Cythonizing All .pyx Files in a Folder:\nIf you prefer to compile all `.pyx` files within a specific directory, you can use a wildcard pattern:\n\n```python\nfrom distutils.core import setup\nfrom Cython.Build import cythonize\nimport glob\n\n# Use a wildcard pattern to match all .pyx files in the folder\npyx_files = glob.glob(\"path/to/your/folder/*.pyx\")\n\nsetup(\n    ext_modules = cythonize(pyx_files)\n)\n```\n\n### Alternative Approach Using Wildcards Directly in `cythonize`:\nYou can also directly pass a wildcard pattern to `cythonize` without using `glob`:\n\n```python\nfrom distutils.core import setup\nfrom Cython.Build import cythonize\n\nsetup(\n    ext_modules = cythonize(\"path/to/your/folder/*.pyx\")\n)\n```\n\n### Important Notes:\n- Ensure that the path provided is correct relative to where you run the `setup.py`.\n- When using wildcards, make sure that there are no unwanted `.pyx` files in the directory that you do not wish to compile.\n- If you need to include subdirectories, you might need to modify the pattern or use additional logic to include files from those directories.\n\nThese methods should help you compile multiple `.pyx` files with Cython efficiently."
