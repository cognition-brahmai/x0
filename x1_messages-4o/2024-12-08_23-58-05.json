        "content": "I am interested in generating a more comprehensive visual representation of my sales data using an Excel table. Could you provide me with a detailed code to create a pivot chart that shows not only the total sales for each month in the year, but also the breakdown of sales by product? Moreover, can you explain how I can add additional data to this chart, such as sales targets or historical sales data from previous years? Here is an example of the Excel table I am working with:\n| Date       | Product  | Sales |\n|------------|----------|-------|\n| 01/01/2022 | Product1 | $100  |\n| 01/01/2022 | Product2 | $200  |\n| 02/01/2022 | Product1 | $300  |\n| 02/01/2022 | Product2 | $400  |\n| 03/01/2022 | Product1 | $500  |\n| 03/01/2022 | Product2 | $600  |\nI would appreciate it if you could also suggest some ways to analyze this data more effectively using advanced Excel features. Thank you in advance for your help! And here is the code to create a pivot chart:\n1. Select the entire table (including the headers) and go to \"Insert\" > \"PivotTable.\"\n2. In the PivotTable Fields pane, drag the \"Date\" column to the \"Rows\" area, the \"Product\" column to the \"Columns\" area, and the \"Sales\" column to the \"Values\" area.\n3. Right-click on one of the dates in the PivotTable and select \"Group.\"\n4. In the Grouping dialog box, select \"Months\" and click \"OK.\"\n5. Go to \"Insert\" > \"Recommended Charts\" and select the \"Clustered Column\" chart.\n6. With the chart selected, go to \"Design\" > \"Chart Styles\" to customize the appearance of the chart as desired."
