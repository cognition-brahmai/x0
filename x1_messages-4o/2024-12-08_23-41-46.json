        "content": "To calculate the sum of integers from 1 to `n` using a recursive function in Java, you don't actually need to use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence, which is \\(\\frac{n \\times (n + 1)}{2}\\). Instead, you can implement the recursive approach directly. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```java\npublic class SumOfIntegers {\n\n    public static int sum(int n) {\n        // Base case: if n is 1, the sum is 1\n        if (n == 1) {\n            return 1;\n        }\n        // Recursive case: sum of n is n plus the sum of integers up to n-1\n        return n + sum(n - 1);\n    }\n    \n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int n = 5; // Example value\n        System.out.println(\"Sum of integers from 1 to \" + n + \" is: \" + sum(n));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Base Case**: If `n` is 1, the sum is simply 1.\n- **Recursive Case**: For any other positive integer `n`, the sum of numbers from 1 to `n` is `n` plus the sum of numbers from 1 to `n-1`. This is expressed as `n + sum(n - 1)`.\n\nThis recursive function will keep calling itself with a decremented value of `n` until it reaches the base case, at which point it will start returning values back up the call stack."
