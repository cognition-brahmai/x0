However, the exact HTML structure of the Yahoo Finance page may vary, and relying on regular expressions might not consistently yield accurate results due to potential changes in the web page's structure.\n\nBelow is a Scala code example that aims to perform this task, but keep in mind that web scraping directly from web pages can be unreliable and is subject to the terms of service of the website you are accessing. Use such scripts responsibly and ensure compliance with relevant legal and ethical guidelines.\n\n```scala\nimport scala.io.Source\nimport scala.util.matching.Regex\n\nobject CompanyNameExtractor {\n  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\n    val url = \"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/profile?p=AAPL\"\n    val html = Source.fromURL(url).mkString\n\n    // Attempt to extract the legal name using a regular expression\n    // Note: This is a simple approach and may not be reliable for all HTML structures\n    val namePattern: Regex = \"\"\"<h3.*?>(.*?)</h3>\"\"\".r\n    val name: String = namePattern.findFirstMatchIn(html).map(_.group(1)).getOrElse(\"Unknown\")\n    \n    // Print the extracted name\n    println(s\"Company Name: $name\")\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Important Considerations:\n1. **Web Scraping Legality**: Always check the terms of service of the website from which you're scraping data. Unauthorized scraping might violate their terms.\n   \n2. **HTML Structure**: The HTML structure of web pages can change over time, making regex-based parsing brittle. For more reliable parsing, using an HTML parsing library like JSoup may be beneficial.\n\n3. **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of the rate at which you send requests to the server to avoid being blocked due to excessive requests.\n\n4. **API Usage**: Consider using an official API if available, as it is a more reliable and often legally compliant way to access data.\n\nThis script provides a basic framework, but for more robust solutions, consider using libraries designed for HTML parsing and handling dynamic content, such as Selenium for Java/Scala."
