For example, the code `table = Cell(\"A1\").table` gives `table = [['Heading1', 'Heading2'], [1 , 2], [3, 4]]`. I am also using `headers = table.pop(0)` to get the headers as a list and leave the data. However, I'm wondering if there is a simpler or more efficient method to achieve this as I can't find any in the documentation. Can anyone provide any guidance or point me to the right method?"

        "content": "Your current approach is quite straightforward and efficient for the task you're performing. However, if you're looking for a more streamlined way to convert your list of lists into a pandas DataFrame, you can directly pass both the data and headers to the DataFrame constructor. Here's a more concise way to achieve what you're doing:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming `table` is the list of lists obtained from DataNitro\ntable = [['Heading1', 'Heading2'], [1, 2], [3, 4]]\n\n# Create a DataFrame directly from the table, using the first row as the header\ndf = pd.DataFrame(table[1:], columns=table[0])\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThis method eliminates the need to manually pop the headers from the table, making the code a bit cleaner. It directly uses the first row of your data as column headers when creating the DataFrame.\n\nIf you're working with a larger dataset or require more complex data manipulation, you might consider optimizing other parts of your workflow. However, for reading a simple range of cells and converting them into a DataFrame, this approach should serve you well."
