Determine the smallest integer greater than the square root of the current sum.\n3. Check if adding a certain number to the current sum makes it a perfect square.\n\nHere's a Python script to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_missing_number_to_make_perfect_square(num_list):\n    current_sum = sum(num_list)\n    next_int = math.ceil(math.sqrt(current_sum))\n\n    # Check from the current sum to the next perfect square\n    while True:\n        perfect_square = next_int ** 2\n        missing_number = perfect_square - current_sum\n        if missing_number >= 0:\n            return missing_number\n        next_int += 1\n\n# Input list\ninput_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# Find the missing number\nmissing_number = find_missing_number_to_make_perfect_square(input_list)\n\nprint(f\"The missing number is: {missing_number}\")\n```\n\nThis code calculates the current sum of the list, finds the next integer that could make the sum a perfect square, and then computes the missing number needed to achieve that perfect square."
