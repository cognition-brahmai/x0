I have found a solution but it isn't very elegant. Here is my current solution:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nx = np.array([0,10,20,30,40,50,60])\nexclude = [1, 3, 5]\nprint x[list(set(range(len(x))) - set(exclude))]\n```\n\nIs there a better way to achieve this?"

You can use NumPy's built-in functionality to achieve this without converting to sets. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nx = np.array([0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60])\nexclude = [1, 3, 5]\n\n# Use np.delete to remove elements at the specified indices\nresult = np.delete(x, exclude)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThe `np.delete` function is specifically designed for removing elements at specified indices from an array. This method is neat and more efficient than using set operations."
