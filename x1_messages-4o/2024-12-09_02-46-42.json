        "content": "I am using the GPU version of Keras for applying transfer-learning on a pre-trained network. I am unsure of how to optimally define the parameters: `max_queue_size`, `workers`, and `use_multiprocessing` in the `fit_generator()` function. If I change these parameters to speed up learning, will all data still be seen per epoch? How is `max_queue_size` related to `workers`? How can I determine how many batches my CPU can generate in parallel? Do I need to set `use_multiprocessing` to true if I change `workers`, and how does it relate to CPU usage? Here is how I am currently using `fit_generator()`:\n\n```\n    history = model.fit_generator(\n      generator=trainGenerator,\n      steps_per_epoch=trainGenerator.samples//nBatches,\n      epochs=nEpochs,\n      verbose=2,\n      callbacks=callback,\n      validation_data=valGenerator,\n      validation_steps=valGenerator.samples//nBatches,\n      class_weight=classWeights,\n      max_queue_size=10,\n      workers=1,\n      use_multiprocessing=False,\n      shuffle=True,\n      initial_epoch=0)   \n```\n\nThe specifications of my machine are as follows:\n\n```\nCPU : 2xXeon E5-2260 2.6 GHz\nCores: 10\nGraphic card: Titan X, Maxwell, GM200\nRAM: 128 GB\nHDD: 4TB\nSSD: 512 GB\n```"

        "content": "To optimize the parameters `max_queue_size`, `workers`, and `use_multiprocessing` in the `fit_generator()` method, it's essential to understand how these parameters work together and how they can affect your training process.\n\n1. **Workers**: This parameter specifies the number of processes to use for data loading. Increasing the number of workers can help speed up data loading, especially when your data augmentation or preprocessing is CPU-intensive. However, the optimal number of workers depends on your CPU capabilities and the nature of your data preprocessing tasks.\n\n2. **Max Queue Size**: This parameter defines the maximum size of the generator queue. A larger queue size allows more pre-processed batches to be stored in memory, which can be beneficial if your data generator is faster than your GPU training loop. However, setting it too high may increase memory usage unnecessarily.\n\n3. **Use Multiprocessing**: When set to `True`, this uses the Python multiprocessing library to parallelize data loading. This can be beneficial for CPU-bound data loading tasks but comes with overhead and complexity, particularly in managing inter-process communication.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Workers**: Start with a small number of workers (e.g., 2-4) and gradually increase until you find a balance between data loading speed and CPU usage. Given your machine's 20 cores (with hyper-threading), you could eventually go higher, but watch for diminishing returns and ensure it doesn't interfere with other processes.\n\n- **Max Queue Size**: A typical starting point is 10, but you can experiment with larger values if you notice that your GPU is often idle, waiting for data. Increasing this can help if your data generator is the bottleneck.\n\n- **Use Multiprocessing**: Set this to `True` if you see a significant speedup in data loading with increased workers. However, be cautious of potential incompatibility issues and increased complexity in debugging.\n\n### Ensuring All Data is Seen:\n\n- `fit_generator()` ensures that all data is seen per epoch as long as `steps_per_epoch` is set correctly. This should be `trainGenerator.samples // nBatches` to cover the entire dataset.\n\n### Determining Parallel Batch Generation:\n\n- To determine how many batches your CPU can generate in parallel, monitor CPU usage and GPU utilization. If the GPU is waiting for data, increase the number of workers.\n\n### Relation Between Parameters:\n\n- `max_queue_size` and `workers` work together to manage how much pre-processed data is available to the GPU. More workers can fill the queue faster, but if `max_queue_size` is too small, you won't benefit from the increased workers.\n\n- Using multiprocessing can allow more efficient use of workers, but it might not always be necessary unless you observe data loading becoming a bottleneck.\n\n### Monitoring:\n\n- Use system monitoring tools (like `htop` or `nvidia-smi`) to keep an eye on CPU and GPU usage. Adjust parameters based on the observed bottlenecks.\n\nIn summary, start with sensible defaults and adjust based on empirical observations of your system's performance. Experiment with different configurations and monitor the results to find the optimal setup for your specific workload."
