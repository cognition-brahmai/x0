The model is a Graph model in Keras and the code that causes this error is:\n\n```python\nscore, acc = model.evaluate({\n    'input1': X_test1,\n    'input2': X_test2,\n    'output':Y_test}, batch_size=450)\n```\n\nHowever, when I change the code to make predictions, it runs fine:\n\n```python\npredictions = model.predict({\n    'input1': X_test1,\n    'input2': X_test2}, batch_size=450)['output']\n```\n\nThe `Y_test` here is a `numpy.ndarray` of `numpy.ndarray`, a one-hot encoded vector. A sample `Y_test` looks like this:\n\n```python\n[[1.,0.,0.],[1.,0.,0.],[0.,0.,1.]]\n```\n\nHow can I fix this TypeError?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, `TypeError: 'numpy.float64' object is not iterable`, usually indicates that the `evaluate` function is returning a single scalar value instead of a tuple of two values (score and accuracy). This can happen if the model is not set up to produce multiple outputs.\n\nBased on your description, it seems like the `evaluate` function is returning only one value. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and fix this issue:\n\n1. **Check Model Configuration**: Make sure your model is configured to output both the loss and the metric (accuracy in this case). If your model is not set up to calculate an accuracy metric during evaluation, it will only return the loss value.\n\n2. **Model Compilation**: Ensure that your model is compiled with the appropriate loss function and metrics. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   model.compile(optimizer='adam',\n                 loss='categorical_crossentropy',\n                 metrics=['accuracy'])\n   ```\n\n3. **Return Values of `evaluate`**: Print the result of `evaluate` to see what it actually returns. Change your `evaluate` call to:\n\n   ```python\n   result = model.evaluate({'input1': X_test1, 'input2': X_test2, 'output': Y_test}, batch_size=450)\n   print(result)\n   ```\n\n   If `result` is a single value, then your model is not configured to return accuracy.\n\n4. **Metric Calculation**: If you need to compute accuracy separately, you can calculate it manually by comparing predicted labels with true labels from `Y_test`. You can use:\n\n   ```python\n   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n   import numpy as np\n\n   predictions = model.predict({'input1': X_test1, 'input2': X_test2}, batch_size=450)['output']\n   predicted_classes = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1)\n   true_classes = np.argmax(Y_test, axis=1)\n   accuracy = accuracy_score(true_classes, predicted_classes)\n   print('Accuracy:', accuracy)\n   ```\n\nBy checking these aspects, you should be able to diagnose why the `evaluate` function isn't returning both loss and accuracy, and fix the issue accordingly."
