Here's how you can do it:\n\n```bash\nbasename \"$(pwd)\"\n```\n\nThis command works as follows:\n\n- `pwd` prints the full path of the current working directory.\n- `basename` strips the directory path and returns only the final component, which is the name of the current directory.\n\nSo, if your current working directory is `/opt/local/bin`, running the above command will return `bin`."
