        "content": "To resolve the error you're encountering while trying to install the package with `pip`, you'll need to ensure that the correct version of Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools is installed and properly configured on your system. Here are some steps to help you troubleshoot and fix the issue:\n\n1. **Install Microsoft C++ Build Tools:**\n   - Visit the [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) page and download the build tools installer.\n   - Run the installer and select the \"Desktop development with C++\" workload. Make sure to include the latest MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++) compiler and Windows SDK.\n\n2. **Ensure Environment Variables are Set:**\n   - After installation, ensure that the paths to the build tools are correctly set in your environment variables. The installer should handle this automatically, but you can verify it by checking if paths like `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\BuildTools\\MSBuild\\Current\\Bin` are included in your `PATH` environment variable.\n\n3. **Restart Your Computer:**\n   - Sometimes, a system restart is necessary for changes to take effect, especially after modifying environment variables or installing new software.\n\n4. **Verify Installation:**\n   - Open a new command prompt and run:\n     ```bash\n     cl\n     ```\n   - This command should provide you with output indicating the version of the C++ compiler. If it shows an error, the installation might not have been successful.\n\n5. **Check for Specific Package Requirements:**\n   - Some Python packages may require specific versions of Visual C++ Build Tools. Check the documentation or repository of the package you're trying to install for any specific requirements.\n\n6. **Alternative Installation Methods:**\n   - If the package you're trying to install is available as a precompiled wheel, you can download it from [the Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) or [Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) and install it using:\n     ```bash\n     pip install path_to_downloaded_wheel.whl\n     ```\n\n7. **Check for Package Updates:**\n   - The package you're trying to install might have had updates that resolve this issue. Try:\n     ```bash\n     pip install --upgrade google-search-api\n     ```\n\nIf these steps do not resolve the issue, please provide more details about your system and any additional error messages you receive, and I'll be happy to assist further."
