With the latest version of fastai, do I still need to have non-empty train and valid folders in order to import my learner and predict on the test set? Furthermore, I\u2019m currently looping through every test image and using `learn.predict_array`, but is there a way to predict in batches on a test folder? Here is the code I'm currently using to load and predict:\n\n```python\nPATH = '/path/to/model/'\nsz = 224\narch=resnet34\ntfms = tfms_from_model(resnet34, sz, aug_tfms=transforms_side_on, max_zoom=1.1)\ndata = ImageClassifierData.from_paths(PATH, tfms=tfms, bs=64)\nlearn = ConvLearner.pretrained(arch, data, precompute=False)\nlearn.unfreeze()\nlearn.load('224_all')\n\nimgs = sorted(glob(os.path.join(test_path, '*.jpg')))\npreds = []\n_,val_tfms = tfms_from_model(resnet34, 224)\nfor n, i in enumerate(imgs):\n    im = val_tfms(open_image(i))[None]\n    preds.append(1-np.argmax(learn.predict_array(im)[0]))\n```\nIs there a cleaner way to accomplish this task?"

        "content": "With the latest versions of the fastai library, you can indeed streamline your workflow and handle predictions more efficiently. Here are some updated strategies you can consider:\n\n1. **Loading the Learner without Train/Valid Folders:**\n   - If you only need to perform inference and don't have new training or validation data, you can create a dummy dataset with empty train and valid folders just to satisfy the data structure requirements, although this is not strictly necessary with more recent updates. The `ImageDataBunch` can be used with only a test set in the latest versions.\n\n2. **Batch Prediction:**\n   - You can use the `get_preds` method to perform batch predictions on a test set. This method will help you avoid the inefficiency of predicting one image at a time. Here\u2019s how you can adjust your code:\n\n```python\nfrom fastai.vision import *\n\n# Assuming you have the latest fastai library\npath = Path('/path/to/model/')\ntest_path = path/'test'  # Path where your test images are stored\n\n# Create a DataBunch with empty train/valid and test set\ndata = ImageDataBunch.from_folder(path, train='.', valid_pct=0.0, test='test', \n                                  size=224, bs=64, ds_tfms=get_transforms())\n\nlearn = cnn_learner(data, models.resnet34)\nlearn.load('224_all')\n\n# Get predictions for the test set\npreds, _ = learn.get_preds(DatasetType.Test)\n\n# Convert predictions to class indices (if needed)\nclass_preds = preds.argmax(dim=1)\n\n# If you need to map indices to class names\nclass_names = data.classes\npredicted_classes = [class_names[i] for i in class_preds]\n```\n\n3. **About Data Transformations:**\n   - The newer fastai API handles transformations differently. When using `ImageDataBunch.from_folder`, you can specify transformations via `ds_tfms=get_transforms()`, which handles augmentations and resizing internally.\n\n4. **Efficient Data Handling:**\n   - Ensure your test images are organized under a `test` directory within the main path. This allows fastai to recognize them as a test set automatically.\n\nBy leveraging these features in the fastai library, you can simplify your workflow and speed up the prediction process on large test sets."
