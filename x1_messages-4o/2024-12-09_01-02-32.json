However, I'm struggling to do this with a variable. If I have a variable like `string = 'example'`, none of the following methods work: `b(string)`, `b string`, `b'' + string`. Is there a simple way to achieve this?"

        "content": "To convert a string variable to a bytes object with a `b` prefix in Python, you need to encode the string using the `encode()` method. This method converts the string into a bytes object, which is the equivalent of adding a `b` prefix. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Your original string variable\nstring = 'example'\n\n# Convert the string to bytes\nbytes_variable = string.encode('utf-8')\n\nprint(bytes_variable)  # Output: b'example'\n```\n\nIn this example, `encode('utf-8')` is used to specify the encoding type, which is commonly 'utf-8', but you can choose a different encoding if necessary. The resulting `bytes_variable` is a bytes object that starts with a `b` prefix, just like when you write literals such as `b'example'`."
