I have a numpy array filled with random integers like this:\n\n```python\ntemp = np.random.randint(1,10, 10) \ntemp\n# Output: array([2, 4, 7, 4, 2, 2, 7, 6, 4, 4])\n```\nWhen I try to sort it using `np.sort(temp)`, it sorts in ascending order by default. I want the output in descending order. I know I can sort the array and then reverse it like this:\n```python\nreverse_order = np.sort(temp)[::-1]\n```\nBut, is this method efficient? Does it create an ascending order array first, and then reverses it to get the result in reversed order? Is there a more efficient alternative, considering `np.sort` doesn't seem to accept parameters to change the comparison sign in the sort operation to get things in reverse order?"

        "content": "Yes, you are correct that using `np.sort(temp)[::-1]` first sorts the array in ascending order and then reverses it, which involves two operations. However, there is a more efficient way to sort a NumPy array in descending order using `numpy.argsort()` or `numpy.sort()` with a negative sign on the array itself.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n### Using `numpy.argsort()`\nThe `argsort()` function returns the indices that would sort an array. By using it with a negative sign, you can sort in descending order efficiently:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ntemp = np.random.randint(1, 10, 10)\nsorted_indices = np.argsort(-temp)\ndescending_order = temp[sorted_indices]\n\nprint(\"Original array:\", temp)\nprint(\"Descending order:\", descending_order)\n```\n\n### Using `numpy.sort()` with a negative sign:\nAlternatively, you can sort the negative of the array, which effectively sorts it in descending order:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ntemp = np.random.randint(1, 10, 10)\ndescending_order = np.sort(-temp) * -1\n\nprint(\"Original array:\", temp)\nprint(\"Descending order:\", descending_order)\n```\n\nBoth methods are efficient and avoid the need to reverse the array after sorting it in ascending order. These approaches directly provide you with a sorted array in descending order."
