My question is, can I use javadoc as a docstring documentation in Python? If so, what are the established conventions and/or official guidelines in this regard? For instance, is the following format too elaborate for Python or should I aim for a more concise documentation? And if this is too exhaustive, can I opt for a format where most of the documentation doesn't get printed through the __doc__ method?\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nreplaces template place holder with values\n\n@param string timestamp     formatted date to display\n@param string priority      priority number\n@param string priority_name priority name\n@param string message       message to display\n\n@return string formatted string\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n```python\n# replaces template place holder with values\n#    \n# @param string timestamp     formatted date to display\n# @param string priority      priority number\n# @param string priority_name priority name\n# @param string message       message to display\n#    \n# @return string formatted string\n\ndef format(self, timestamp = '', priority = '', priority_name = '', message = ''):\n    \"\"\"\n    replaces template place holder with values\n    \"\"\"\n    values = {'%timestamp%' : timestamp,\n              '%priorityName%' : priority_name,\n              '%priority%' : priority,\n              '%message%' : message}\n\n    return self.__pattern.format(**values)\n```"

        "content": "When transitioning from PHP to Python, it's important to adapt to Python's conventions and idiomatic practices. Python primarily uses docstrings for documentation, and while you can technically use any format within a docstring, it's often best to follow the conventions of the Python community for consistency and readability.\n\nPython's docstring conventions are outlined in PEP 257, and many developers use reStructuredText (reST) or Google style format within their docstrings. Here's how you can adapt your javadoc-style documentation to fit Python conventions, using the Google style format for example:\n\n```python\ndef format(self, timestamp='', priority='', priority_name='', message=''):\n    \"\"\"\n    Replaces template placeholders with values.\n\n    Args:\n        timestamp (str): Formatted date to display.\n        priority (str): Priority number.\n        priority_name (str): Priority name.\n        message (str): Message to display.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: Formatted string.\n    \"\"\"\n    values = {\n        '%timestamp%': timestamp,\n        '%priorityName%': priority_name,\n        '%priority%': priority,\n        '%message%': message\n    }\n\n    return self.__pattern.format(**values)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Docstring Placement**: Place the docstring immediately after the function definition line.\n\n2. **Conciseness vs. Clarity**: Aim for clear and concise documentation. The above example provides necessary details without being overly verbose.\n\n3. **Docstring Formats**: Consider using popular formats like Google, NumPy, or reST if you're planning on generating documentation using tools like Sphinx.\n\n4. **Printing Docstrings**: The `__doc__` attribute will contain whatever you write in the docstring, so consider this when deciding what to include.\n\n5. **Type Annotations**: Python supports type annotations, which can complement your documentation. For example, you can write `def format(self, timestamp: str = '', ...) -> str:`.\n\nBy following these conventions, you ensure your code is more maintainable and understandable by other Python developers."
