        "content": "Yes, it is feasible to construct a residual network using only fully connected layers, although it is not the most common approach. Residual networks (ResNets) are typically associated with convolutional layers because they are primarily used for image processing tasks, where convolutional operations are highly effective at capturing spatial hierarchies and patterns. However, the core idea of a residual network\u2014using skip connections to add the input of a layer to its output\u2014can be applied to fully connected (or dense) layers as well.\n\nIn a fully connected residual network, each residual block would consist of fully connected layers with skip connections. The skip connections help in mitigating the vanishing gradient problem by allowing gradients to flow through the network more effectively, similar to how they function in convolutional ResNets.\n\nWhile there are no well-known, large-scale networks composed entirely of fully connected layers with residual connections for tasks like image classification, this approach can be useful in other domains. For instance, in natural language processing or time-series prediction, where the data does not have a spatial structure, dense residual networks can be employed.\n\nThe primary consideration when building such networks is whether the fully connected architecture is well-suited to the task. If the data benefits more from learning hierarchical spatial features, convolutional layers might be more appropriate. However, for tasks where the relationships between features are more abstract or non-spatial, a fully connected residual network can be an interesting alternative to explore."
