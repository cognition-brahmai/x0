When I inspect an instance of 'TypeTwoEvent' class, I check for a field 'foobar' that exists in the base class, expecting it to default to the value 'None'. However, an exception is raised, stating: \"AttributeError: 'TypeTwoEvent' object has no attribute 'foobar'\". I was under the impression that the base class fields would be inherited by the subclass and that creating an instance of a subclass will instantiate the base class, thus invoking its constructor. So, why does 'TypeTwoEvent' not have a 'foobar' attribute when the base class from which it is derived has a 'foobar' attribute? Here is the code:\n\n```python\nclass Event:\n    def __init__(self, sr1=None, foobar=None):\n        self.sr1 = sr1\n        self.foobar = foobar\n        self.state = STATE_NON_EVENT\n \n# Event class wrappers to provide syntactic sugar\nclass TypeTwoEvent(Event):\n    def __init__(self, level=None):\n        self.sr1 = level\n        self.state = STATE_EVENT_TWO\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is due to the fact that the `__init__` method of the `TypeTwoEvent` subclass is overriding the `__init__` method of the `Event` base class. In Python, when you define an `__init__` method in a subclass, it does not automatically call the `__init__` method of its superclass. This means that any initialization logic in the base class constructor is not executed unless you explicitly call the base class's `__init__` method.\n\nTo ensure that the `foobar` attribute from the `Event` base class is initialized, you need to explicitly call the base class's `__init__` method within the `__init__` method of the `TypeTwoEvent` subclass. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nclass Event:\n    def __init__(self, sr1=None, foobar=None):\n        self.sr1 = sr1\n        self.foobar = foobar\n        self.state = \"STATE_NON_EVENT\"\n\nclass TypeTwoEvent(Event):\n    def __init__(self, level=None):\n        # Call the base class constructor\n        super().__init__(sr1=level)\n        self.state = \"STATE_EVENT_TWO\"\n\n# Example usage\nevent_instance = TypeTwoEvent()\nprint(event_instance.foobar)  # This will now print: None\n```\n\nHere, I used `super().__init__(sr1=level)` to call the base class's constructor, which ensures that the `foobar` attribute is initialized to `None`, as intended. The `super()` function allows you to access methods from a parent class, which is useful for maintaining the behavior of base class methods when they are overridden in a subclass."
