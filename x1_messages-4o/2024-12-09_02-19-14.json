Would this be the correct way to type hint the function, `FuncA(arg)`, where `arg` is the argument:\n\n```python\ndef FuncA(arg: CustomClass):\n```\n\nOr should I be using the `Type` class from the `typing` module like this:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Type\n\ndef FuncA(Arg:Type[CustomClass]):\n```"

Therefore, the correct approach would be:\n\n```python\ndef FuncA(arg: CustomClass):\n```\n\nThis indicates that `arg` is expected to be an instance of `CustomClass`.\n\nThe `Type` class from the `typing` module is used when you want to specify that an argument should be a class itself, and not an instance of the class. It is useful in scenarios where you expect a class object as an argument. For example, if you want to pass the class `CustomClass` itself (not its instance) to a function, you would use:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Type\n\ndef FuncA(arg: Type[CustomClass]):\n```\n\nIn your case, since you want to pass an instance of `CustomClass`, you should use the first option."
