It seems to work on a matrix with random values, but not on a specific one where a circle should appear. The code I'm using is as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport numpy as np\n\nradius = 0.5\nsize = 10\nx, y = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(-1, 1, size), np.linspace(-1, 1, size))\nf = np.vectorize(lambda x, y: (1.0 if x * x + y * y < radius * radius else 0.0))\nz = f(x, y)\nprint(z)\nzz = np.random.random((size, size))\nimg = Image.fromarray(zz, mode='L') # if I replace zz with z here, it just produces a black image\nimg.save('my_pic.png')\n```\n\nCan anyone explain what I'm doing wrong?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the data type and value range of the array `z` you are trying to convert to an image. When you use `Image.fromarray` with mode `'L'`, it expects an array of integers where each value is in the range [0, 255]. However, your array `z` contains floating-point values of either `0.0` or `1.0`, which, when converted directly, result in a nearly black image since the maximum value is only `1.0`.\n\nTo fix this, you need to scale the values in `z` to the appropriate range for a grayscale image. Here\u2019s how you can adjust your code:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport numpy as np\n\nradius = 0.5\nsize = 10\nx, y = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(-1, 1, size), np.linspace(-1, 1, size))\nf = np.vectorize(lambda x, y: (1.0 if x * x + y * y < radius * radius else 0.0))\nz = f(x, y)\n\n# Scale z to 0-255 range for grayscale image representation\nz_scaled = (z * 255).astype(np.uint8)\n\n# Create the image from the scaled array\nimg = Image.fromarray(z_scaled, mode='L')\nimg.save('my_pic.png')\n```\n\nThis code scales the values of `z` from the range [0, 1] to [0, 255], which is suitable for an 8-bit grayscale image. By casting the scaled array to `np.uint8`, you ensure the values are treated correctly as pixel intensities in the image."
