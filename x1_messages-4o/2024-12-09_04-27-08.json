These functions make curl calls and parse the information into two separate lists. I understand that the speed is mostly determined by the ISP connection, but I would like them to start asynchronously. I am considering two different implementations and I have several questions about each. \n\nThe first implementation is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef foo():\n    pass\n\ndef bar():\n    pass\n\np1 = Process(target=foo, args=())\np2 = Process(target=bar, args=())\n\np1.start()\np2.start()\np1.join()\np2.join()\n```\n\nFor this implementation, my question is, since join blocks until the process calling it is completed, does this mean the process p1 has to finish before p2 process starts? I have always understood the .join() to be the same as pool.apply() and pool.apply_sync().get(), where the parent process cannot launch another process(task) until the current one running is completed.\n\nThe second implementation I am considering is:\n\n```python\ndef foo():\n    pass\n\ndef bar():\n    pass\n\npool = Pool(processes=2)             \np1 = pool.apply_async(foo)\np1 = pool.apply_async(bar)\n```\n\nFor this implementation, my questions are as follows: \n1) Should I use pool.close(), pool.join()? \n2) If I use pool.map(), do they all need to complete before I can get results? If so, are they still running asynchronously? \n3) How does pool.apply_async() differ from doing each process with pool.apply()? \n4) How does this differ from the previous implementation with Process?"

        "content": "Let's address your questions regarding Python's multiprocessing with a focus on using `Process` and `Pool`.\n\n### First Implementation with `Process`\n\n1. **Understanding `.join()`**:\n   - `.join()` is used to wait for a process to complete. However, in your code, `p1.start()` and `p2.start()` are called one after the other, which means both `foo()` and `bar()` will start executing almost simultaneously.\n   - The `.join()` method is called after both processes have started, so it will wait for both processes to complete, but it doesn't block the starting of `p2` until `p1` finishes. Both processes can run concurrently.\n\n### Second Implementation with `Pool`\n\n1. **Using `pool.close()` and `pool.join()`**:\n   - Yes, you should typically use `pool.close()` to indicate that no more tasks will be submitted to the pool. After closing the pool, `pool.join()` is used to wait for the worker processes to finish executing the tasks.\n   \n2. **Behavior of `pool.map()`**:\n   - `pool.map()` is a blocking operation, meaning it waits for all tasks to complete before returning the results. The tasks themselves are run asynchronously in separate processes, so they execute concurrently, but the `map()` function waits for all to finish before it returns.\n\n3. **Difference between `pool.apply_async()` and `pool.apply()`**:\n   - `pool.apply()` is blocking and waits for the task to complete and return a result before moving to the next task.\n   - `pool.apply_async()` is non-blocking and submits tasks to the pool to be run asynchronously. You can retrieve the results later using the `.get()` method on the result object returned by `apply_async()`.\n\n4. **Comparison of `Pool` vs `Process`**:\n   - Using `Process`, you have more control over individual processes, but you need to manage starting and joining them manually.\n   - `Pool` is a higher-level interface that abstracts some of this management, allowing you to easily distribute tasks across multiple processes. It's particularly useful for batch processing tasks.\n   - `Pool` is generally more convenient when you have a known number of tasks to distribute across the worker processes, whereas `Process` can be more flexible for custom process management.\n\nIn your specific case, if you're mainly looking to execute `foo()` and `bar()` concurrently without much additional complexity, both implementations are valid. However, `Pool` can simplify your code if you plan to scale up the number of tasks or need to handle them as a batch."
