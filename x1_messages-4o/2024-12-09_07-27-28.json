I tried using the `os.path.split()` function, but it didn't provide the expected output. For example, I want to achieve this effect:\n\n```python\npath = \"/foo/bar/baz/file\"\npath_split = path.rsplit('/')[1:]\nprint(path_split)\n# Output: ['foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'file']\n```\nBut, I would like a solution that works cross-platform."

        "content": "To split a file path into its components in a way that works across both Unix-based and Windows systems, you can use the `os.path` module from the `os` library in Python. Specifically, you can use `os.path.split()` in combination with `os.path.sep` or `os.path.normpath()` and `str.split()` to handle the differences in path separators between Unix (\"/\") and Windows (\"\\\\\").\n\nHere's a cross-platform solution:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef split_path(path):\n    # Normalize the path to ensure the separator is consistent\n    normalized_path = os.path.normpath(path)\n    # Split the path components based on the OS-specific separator\n    components = normalized_path.split(os.sep)\n    return components\n\n# Example usage\npath_unix = \"/foo/bar/baz/file\"\npath_windows = \"C:\\\\foo\\\\bar\\\\baz\\\\file\"\n\nprint(split_path(path_unix))\n# Output: ['foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'file']\n\nprint(split_path(path_windows))\n# Output: ['C:', 'foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'file']\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `os.path.normpath()` is used to normalize the path, which means it will convert any path to use the correct separator for the operating system.\n- `os.sep` is the OS-specific path separator (\"/\" for Unix and \"\\\\\" for Windows).\n- `str.split(os.sep)` splits the normalized path into its components based on the correct separator.\n\nThis approach ensures that your path-splitting works consistently across different operating systems."
