        "content": "In Python, the modulus operation is performed using the `%` operator, and it works as expected according to the mathematical definition of modulus. When you calculate `15 % 4`, the result is indeed `3`, which is consistent with the operation \\(15 \\div 4\\) leaving a remainder of `3`. \n\nIt seems there might be a misunderstanding regarding the operation \"15 mod 4\" yielding `1`. In Python, both `15 % 4` and `15 mod 4` should yield the same result, which is `3`, because the mathematical modulus operation is the same as the remainder of the division.\n\nIf you want to ensure that the result is always positive (which is especially important in some programming languages when dealing with negative numbers), Python's `%` operator already handles this correctly. For example, `-15 % 4` would return `1` in Python.\n\nHere's a simple example to illustrate:\n\n```python\n# Calculating modulus\nresult = 15 % 4\nprint(result)  # Output will be 3\n\n# Handling negative numbers\nnegative_result = -15 % 4\nprint(negative_result)  # Output will be 1\n```\n\nNo special function from the `math` library is needed to perform a modulus operation, as the `%` operator is sufficient and behaves correctly for both positive and negative numbers. If you expected a different result based on a different context or definition, please clarify, and I'll be happy to help further!"
