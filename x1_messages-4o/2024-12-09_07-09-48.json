Currently, I am able to log the debug strings into a file using Python's logging module with the following code:\n\n```python\nimport logging\nimport logging.handlers\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger(\"\")\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nhandler = logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler(\n    LOGFILE, maxBytes=(1048576*5), backupCount=7\n)\n\nformatter = logging.Formatter(\"%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s\")\nhandler.setFormatter(formatter)\nlogger.addHandler(handler)\n```\n\nand I call a logger function like this:\n\n```python\nlogger.debug(\"I am written to the file\")\n```"

        "content": "To configure the logger to log messages to both a file and stdout, you can add an additional handler for stdout. You can use `logging.StreamHandler` to achieve this. Here\u2019s how you can modify your existing setup to include logging to both a file and stdout:\n\n```python\nimport logging\nimport logging.handlers\n\n# Configuration\nLOGFILE = 'your_log_file.log'\n\n# Create root logger\nlogger = logging.getLogger(\"\")\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\n# File handler for logging to a file\nfile_handler = logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler(\n    LOGFILE, maxBytes=(1048576*5), backupCount=7\n)\n\n# Stdout handler for logging to the console\nconsole_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\n\n# Create formatter and set it to both handlers\nformatter = logging.Formatter(\"%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s\")\nfile_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\nconsole_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\n# Add handlers to the logger\nlogger.addHandler(file_handler)\nlogger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\n# Example log message\nlogger.debug(\"I am written to the file and printed to stdout\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **File Handler (`RotatingFileHandler`)**: This handler is already set up in your code to write log messages to a file with rotation.\n- **Console Handler (`StreamHandler`)**: This handler is added to output log messages to stdout (the console).\n- **Formatter**: A single formatter is used for both handlers so that the log messages have a consistent format whether they are written to the file or printed to stdout.\n- **Adding Handlers**: Both handlers are added to the logger, allowing each log message to be processed by both handlers.\n\nWith this setup, any log message that you send to the logger will be written to both the specified log file and the console."
