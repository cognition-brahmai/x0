My current code is:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport argparse\n\nfrom apiclient.discovery import build\nfrom apiclient.errors import HttpError\nfrom oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials\n\nGOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = './Peepl-cb1dac99bdc0.json'\n\ndef main(project_id):\n    # Grab the application's default credentials from the environment.\n    credentials = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()\n    print(credentials)\n    # Construct the service object for interacting with the BigQuery API.\n    bigquery_service = build('bigquery', 'v2', credentials=credentials)\n\n    try:\n        query_request = bigquery_service.jobs()\n        query_data = {\n            'query': (\n                'SELECT TOP(corpus, 10) as title, '\n                'COUNT(*) as unique_words '\n                'FROM [publicdata:samples.shakespeare];')\n        }\n\n        query_response = query_request.query(\n            projectId=project_id,\n            body=query_data).execute()\n\n        print('Query Results:')\n        for row in query_response['rows']:\n            print('\\t'.join(field['v'] for field in row['f']))\n\n    except HttpError as err:\n        print('Error: {}'.format(err.content))\n        raise err\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(\n        description=__doc__,\n        formatter_class=argparse.RawDescriptionHelpFormatter)\n    parser.add_argument('project_id', help='Your Google Cloud Project ID.')\n\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    main(args.project_id)\n```\n\nBut when I run this code, I get this error: \n\n```python\noauth2client.client.ApplicationDefaultCredentialsError: The Application Default Credentials are not available. They are available if running in Google Compute Engine. Otherwise, the environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS must be defined pointing to a file defining the credentials. See https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/application-default-credentials for more information.\n```\n\nDespite having tried to set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` as suggested in the error message, the error persists. Can anyone assist me in resolving this problem?"

        "content": "To resolve the `ApplicationDefaultCredentialsError`, you need to ensure that the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable is properly set and points to the JSON file containing your service account key. Here\u2019s how you can correctly set it up and troubleshoot the issue:\n\n1. **Verify the JSON File Path:** \n   Ensure that the path to your service account JSON key file is correct. The path should be an absolute path or a relative path from the directory where your script is executed.\n\n2. **Set the Environment Variable:**\n   You can set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable in your script before calling the Google Cloud API, or set it in your shell/command prompt session.\n\n   **In your Python script:**\n   ```python\n   import os\n\n   os.environ[\"GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS\"] = \"./Peepl-cb1dac99bdc0.json\"\n   ```\n\n   **In your terminal (before running the script):**\n   - **On Windows:**\n     ```cmd\n     set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=.\\Peepl-cb1dac99bdc0.json\n     ```\n   - **On macOS/Linux:**\n     ```bash\n     export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./Peepl-cb1dac99bdc0.json\n     ```\n\n3. **Ensure the File Exists:**\n   Check if the JSON file `Peepl-cb1dac99bdc0.json` exists at the specified location. You can do this by running a simple command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   ls ./Peepl-cb1dac99bdc0.json\n   ```\n\n   If it doesn't exist, make sure you have downloaded the correct service account key file from the Google Cloud Console.\n\n4. **Check Permissions:**\n   Ensure that your application has read permissions for the service account file. You might need to adjust the file permissions using:\n\n   ```bash\n   chmod 644 ./Peepl-cb1dac99bdc0.json\n   ```\n\n5. **Use Updated Libraries:**\n   Make sure you have the latest version of the `google-auth` and `google-api-python-client` libraries as they provide better support and newer features for authentication.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client\n   ```\n\n6. **Verify Service Account Role:**\n   Ensure that the service account associated with the JSON key has the appropriate roles/permissions to access BigQuery. You can do this in the IAM & Admin section of the Google Cloud Console.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `ApplicationDefaultCredentialsError` and successfully connect to Google BigQuery using the BigQuery API in Python."
