I am able to print the names of the files successfully, but when I try to open the file in the loop, I encounter an IOError stating \"No such file or directory\". Do I need to provide the full path of the file while using `open()` function inside the loop, even though I'm already in that directory?\n\nThe code I'm using is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport os\nindir = '/home/des/test'\nfor root, dirs, filenames in os.walk(indir):\n    for f in filenames:\n        print(f)\n```\n\nThis prints the file names correctly:\n\n```python\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n```\n\nBut when I try to open the file in the loop, it throws an error:\n\n```python\nimport os\nindir = '/home/des/test'\nfor root, dirs, filenames in os.walk(indir):\n    for f in filenames:\n        log = open(f, 'r')\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"/home/des/my_python_progs/loop_over_dir.py\", line 6, in <module>\nlog = open(f, 'r')\nIOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '1'\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that the `open()` function requires the complete path to the file, not just the filename. When you use `os.walk()`, it provides the filenames in the directory, but not their full paths. To open the files correctly, you need to construct the full path of each file by joining the directory path (`root`) with the filename (`f`).\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to open the files correctly:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nindir = '/home/des/test'\nfor root, dirs, filenames in os.walk(indir):\n    for f in filenames:\n        file_path = os.path.join(root, f)  # Construct the full path\n        with open(file_path, 'r') as log:  # Use the full path to open the file\n            # You can now read the content of the file\n            content = log.read()\n            print(content)  # Or process the file content as needed\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **`os.path.join()`**: This function helps in constructing the full path by joining the directory path and the filename, ensuring it works correctly across different operating systems.\n- **`with open()`**: Using a `with` statement for opening files is considered good practice as it automatically handles closing the file, even if an error occurs during file operations. \n\nBy making these adjustments, you should be able to open and read each file in the directory without any issues."
