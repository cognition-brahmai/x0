I tried using a solution from another thread, but the output was not as expected. The CSV files are as follows:\n\nfilea.csv: \n\n```\ntitle,stage,jan,feb\ndarn,3.001,0.421,0.532\nok,2.829,1.036,0.751\nthree,1.115,1.146,2.921\n```\n\nfileb.csv: \n\n```\ntitle,mar,apr,may,jun,\ndarn,0.631,1.321,0.951,1.751\nok,1.001,0.247,2.456,0.3216\nthree,0.285,1.283,0.924,956\n```\n\nThe output I want is:\n\n```\ntitle,stage,jan,feb,mar,apr,may,jun\ndarn,3.001,0.421,0.532,0.631,1.321,0.951,1.751\nok,2.829,1.036,0.751,1.001,0.247,2.456,0.3216\nthree,1.115,1.146,2.921,0.285,1.283,0.924,956\n```\n\nHowever, the output I am getting is:\n\n```\ntitle,feb,may\nok,0.751,2.456\nthree,2.921,0.924\ndarn,0.532,0.951\n```\n\nHere is the code I have tried:\n\n```python\n'''\ntesting merging of 2 csv files\n'''\nimport csv\nimport array\nimport os\n\nwith open('Z:\\\\Desktop\\\\test\\\\filea.csv') as f:\n    r = csv.reader(f, delimiter=',')\n    dict1 = {row[0]: row[3] for row in r}\n\nwith open('Z:\\\\Desktop\\\\test\\\\fileb.csv') as f:\n    r = csv.reader(f, delimiter=',')\n    #dict2 = {row[0]: row[3] for row in r}\n    dict2 = {row[0:3] for row in r}\n\nprint str(dict1)\nprint str(dict2)\n\nkeys = set(dict1.keys() + dict2.keys())\nwith open('Z:\\\\Desktop\\\\test\\\\output.csv', 'wb') as f:\n    w = csv.writer(f, delimiter=',')\n    w.writerows([[key, dict1.get(key, \"''\"), dict2.get(key, \"''\")] for key in keys])\n```\n\nAny help in correcting this issue would be greatly appreciated."

        "content": "To merge two CSV files based on a common column, you can use the `pandas` library, which is specifically designed for handling such data operations efficiently. Your current approach using dictionaries is not correctly extracting and merging the data as intended. Below is a solution using `pandas` that should provide the expected output:\n\nFirst, ensure you have `pandas` installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install pandas\n```\n\nThen, you can use the following Python script to merge the two CSV files:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read the first CSV file into a DataFrame\ndf1 = pd.read_csv('Z:\\\\Desktop\\\\test\\\\filea.csv')\n\n# Read the second CSV file into another DataFrame\ndf2 = pd.read_csv('Z:\\\\Desktop\\\\test\\\\fileb.csv')\n\n# Merge the two DataFrames on the 'title' column\nmerged_df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='title')\n\n# Write the merged DataFrame to a new CSV file\nmerged_df.to_csv('Z:\\\\Desktop\\\\test\\\\output.csv', index=False)\n\nprint(merged_df)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Reading CSV Files:** The `pd.read_csv` function reads the CSV files into DataFrames. This makes it easy to manipulate and merge the data.\n  \n2. **Merging DataFrames:** `pd.merge` is used to merge the DataFrames based on a common column, which is `title` in this case.\n\n3. **Writing the Output:** Finally, the merged DataFrame is written to a new CSV file using `to_csv`.\n\nThis approach will give you the desired output:\n\n```\ntitle,stage,jan,feb,mar,apr,may,jun\ndarn,3.001,0.421,0.532,0.631,1.321,0.951,1.751\nok,2.829,1.036,0.751,1.001,0.247,2.456,0.3216\nthree,1.115,1.146,2.921,0.285,1.283,0.924,956\n```\n\nThis solution is not only more concise but also more reliable, taking advantage of the powerful data handling capabilities of `pandas`."
