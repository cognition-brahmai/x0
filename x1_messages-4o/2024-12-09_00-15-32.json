Here's a simplified version of my code:\n\n```python\nfig = plt.figure()\nplt.axis([0, 1000, 0, 1])\n\ni = 0\nx = list()\ny = list()\n\nwhile i < 1000:\n    temp_y = np.random.random()\n    x.append(i)\n    y.append(temp_y)\n    plt.scatter(i, temp_y)\n    i += 1\n    plt.show()\n```\n\nWhen I run this, the window pops up with the first point showing, but then it waits for the loop to finish before it populates the rest of the graph. My expectation was to see the points being plotted one at a time. Can you explain why this is not happening and how can I fix this?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is due to the way `matplotlib` handles its rendering and event loop. By default, `plt.show()` blocks execution until you close the plot window, which means your loop completes before updating the plot in real-time as intended.\n\nTo achieve real-time plotting, you need to refresh the plot with each iteration of the loop. Here's a modified version of your code that should work for real-time plotting using `matplotlib`:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create a figure and axis\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.set_xlim(0, 1000)\nax.set_ylim(0, 1)\n\n# Initialize lists to store the x and y data\nx = []\ny = []\n\n# Initialize a scatter plot\nsc = ax.scatter(x, y)\n\n# Function to update the plot\ndef update_plot(i):\n    temp_y = np.random.random()\n    x.append(i)\n    y.append(temp_y)\n    sc.set_offsets(np.c_[x, y])\n    plt.draw()\n    plt.pause(0.01)  # Pause to update the plot, adjust the pause time as needed\n\n# Plot in a loop\nfor i in range(1000):\n    update_plot(i)\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Key Changes and Explanations:\n\n1. **`plt.subplots()`**: Used to create a figure and axis more conveniently.\n\n2. **`set_offsets()`**: Updates the scatter plot data with new points.\n\n3. **`plt.draw()` and `plt.pause(0.01)`**: These functions are crucial for real-time updates. `plt.draw()` updates the plot with new data, and `plt.pause()` introduces a short pause to allow the plot to refresh. The argument `0.01` is the pause duration in seconds, which you can adjust depending on your needs.\n\n4. **Avoid using `plt.show()` within the loop**: It should only be called once, outside the loop, to display the plot window. `plt.pause()` is used to update the plot in real-time.\n\nBy integrating these changes, you should see your data points being plotted in real-time as expected."
