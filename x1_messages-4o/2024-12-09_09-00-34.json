        "content": "Certainly! To count the number of orders placed within the last 7 days using SQL, you would typically use a query that involves a `WHERE` clause filtering records based on the date. Assuming you have a table named `orders` and a column named `order_date` that stores the date of each order, here is a sample SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS number_of_orders\nFROM orders\nWHERE order_date >= CURDATE() - INTERVAL 7 DAY;\n```\n\nThis query calculates the number of orders where the `order_date` is within the last 7 days. \n\n- `CURDATE()` returns the current date.\n- `INTERVAL 7 DAY` is used to subtract 7 days from the current date.\n- The `WHERE` clause filters orders that have an `order_date` greater than or equal to that calculated date.\n\nMake sure to adjust the table and column names according to your database schema."
