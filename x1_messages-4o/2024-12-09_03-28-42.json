The way I am doing it seems quite verbose, especially when compared to the equivalent Matlab code. Is there a more concise way to achieve this in Python? Here is my current Python code:\n\n```python\na = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]\n[index for index,value in enumerate(a) if value > 2]\n```\n\nAnd here is the equivalent Matlab code:\n\n```matlab\na = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3];\nfind(a>2)\n```"

        "content": "Your current Python code is already quite concise, but there is a way to make it slightly more readable by using the `numpy` library, which provides a function similar to Matlab's `find`. Here's how you can use `numpy` to achieve the same result:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3])\nindices = np.where(a > 2)[0].tolist()\n```\n\nIn this example, `np.where(a > 2)` returns a tuple containing arrays of the indices where the condition is true. We use `[0]` to access the first element of this tuple, which is the array of indices. Finally, `.tolist()` converts the numpy array to a regular Python list.\n\nThis method is especially useful if you're already using `numpy` in your project, or if you're dealing with large datasets and need optimized performance. However, for small lists, your original list comprehension method is perfectly fine and very Pythonic."
