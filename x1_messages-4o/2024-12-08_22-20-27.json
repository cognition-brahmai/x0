To identify mammals in your Excel table, you can filter based on the following two common characteristics:\n\n1. **Mammary Glands**: Mammals have mammary glands that produce milk to feed their young. If your list includes information about whether the animal nurses its young with milk, you can use this characteristic.\n\n2. **Hair or Fur**: Mammals typically have some form of hair or fur on their bodies at some stage of their life. If your list includes details about the presence of hair or fur, this can be another criterion to identify mammals.\n\nUsing these characteristics, you can filter the list to highlight animals that are mammals."
