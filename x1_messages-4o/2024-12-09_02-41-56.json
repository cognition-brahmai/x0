Usually, I use one of the following import statements: `from .mymodule import myfunction` or `from mymodule import myfunction`. However, one of them is leading to either of these errors: `ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package`, `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mymodule'` or `SystemError: Parent module '' not loaded, cannot perform relative import`.

        "content": "When importing functions or modules in Python, especially when they are in the same directory, there are a few things to keep in mind that can lead to the errors you're encountering:\n\n1. **ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package**: This error occurs when you try to use a relative import (like `from .mymodule import myfunction`) in a script that is executed as the main program. Relative imports are only valid within packages. If you're running a script directly, it doesn't recognize itself as part of a package structure. To fix this, either convert your script into a module within a package or use absolute imports.\n\n2. **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mymodule'**: This error indicates that Python cannot find the module you're trying to import. Make sure that `mymodule.py` is in the same directory as your script. If it is, the problem might be related to the Python path. Ensure that the directory containing `mymodule.py` is in your `PYTHONPATH`.\n\n3. **SystemError: Parent module '' not loaded, cannot perform relative import**: This error usually occurs in interactive environments or scripts run directly, where the parent module is not loaded. This is related to the first error and the solution is similar: avoid using relative imports in scripts that are executed directly.\n\n**Solutions**:\n- Use absolute imports if your script is intended to be run directly. For example: `from mymodule import myfunction`.\n- Make sure all necessary directories are included in your `PYTHONPATH`.\n- Consider organizing your code as a proper package, where you have an `__init__.py` file in your directory, allowing relative imports to work as expected when the package is imported.\n- If you're testing or running scripts directly, you can often resolve issues by ensuring your script is executed in an environment that treats it as part of a package (e.g., using `python -m` to run a module).\n\nRemember, Python treats the script being run as `__main__`, which affects how imports are resolved, so organizing your code as a package can help manage this more effectively."
