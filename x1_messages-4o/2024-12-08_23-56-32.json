Subordinate clauses often begin with subordinating conjunctions such as \"because,\" \"since,\" \"if,\" \"although,\" etc.\n\n2. **Adverbial Clause**: This type of subordinate clause functions as an adverb, modifying the verb in the main clause. In this case, \"Since it had been a while\" modifies the verb \"opted\" by providing a reason or context for why \"she opted to watch a film.\"\n\nThe use of the conjunction \"since\" is key in identifying this as an adverbial clause because it indicates a relationship of time or reason between the subordinate clause and the main clause."
