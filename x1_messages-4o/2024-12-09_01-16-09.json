        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the mismatch in the number of samples between your input features `X` and your target variable `Y`. Specifically, `X` is derived from the `train` dataset, while `Y` is derived from the `test` dataset, leading to different sample sizes. Let's go through the steps to fix this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Consistent Data Splitting:**\n   You should ensure that both `X` and `Y` are derived from the same dataset. In most cases, you would want to split a single dataset into features and target variables, then apply the `train_test_split` to that data.\n\n2. **Combine Data:**\n   First, make sure that both your features and target variable are in the same DataFrame. It looks like you have two separate datasets (`train` and `test`). Typically, you would have a single dataset for splitting:\n\n   ```python\n   # Assuming 'train' is your full dataset including the target variable\n   X = train[['id', 'listing_type', 'floor', 'latitude', 'longitude', \n              'beds', 'baths', 'total_rooms', 'square_feet', 'group', 'grades']]\n   Y = train['price']\n   ```\n\n3. **Perform Train-Test Split:**\n   Now you can perform the train-test split on this consistent dataset:\n\n   ```python\n   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split  # Note: use sklearn.model_selection\n   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.3, random_state=0)\n   ```\n\n4. **Fit the Model:**\n   Proceed with fitting your model using `X_train` and `y_train`:\n\n   ```python\n   from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n   regressor = LinearRegression()\n   regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify Data:**\n   Ensure that `train` indeed contains all necessary columns, including the `price` column. If `price` is only available in the `test` DataFrame, you'll need to reconsider how your datasets are structured or named.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error by ensuring consistency between your feature and target datasets."
