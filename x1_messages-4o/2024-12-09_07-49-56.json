Here are two methods I am considering:\n\nMethod 1: \n```python\ndef change(array):\n   array.append(4)\n\nchange(array)\n```\n\nMethod 2: \n```python\ndef change(array):\n  array.append(4)\n  return array\n\narray = change(array)\n```\n\nI am more accustomed to the concept of passing by value, and hence, the second method seems more intuitive to me. However, since Python allows direct mutation of the argument, the second method seems redundant. Also, in my function, there will be several parameters, only one of which will change. The second method makes it clear which argument is changing, but the first method doesn't. Is there a convention for this in Python? Which method is considered 'better'?"

        "content": "In Python, when you pass a mutable object like a list to a function, you are passing a reference to the same object. This means that any modifications you make to the list within the function will affect the original list. Given this behavior, both methods you have proposed will work to mutate the list, but they carry different implications in terms of style and clarity.\n\n### Method 1:\n\n```python\ndef change(array):\n   array.append(4)\n\nchange(array)\n```\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Directly modifies the list in place, which can be more efficient since it doesn't involve creating a new object or assigning anything back to a variable.\n- Simpler when you're confident that you want to mutate the list without needing to capture a return value.\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- It may not be immediately clear which parameters are being mutated, especially in functions with multiple arguments.\n- Can lead to side effects that might be unexpected if not documented properly, making the code less readable or harder to debug.\n\n### Method 2:\n\n```python\ndef change(array):\n  array.append(4)\n  return array\n\narray = change(array)\n```\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Explicitly shows which argument is being changed, making it clear what the function is doing and enhancing readability.\n- Aligns with a functional programming style where functions return new states, which can make reasoning about the code's behavior easier.\n- Useful in cases where you might want to create a new object based on an existing one and return it.\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- Slightly redundant for mutable objects since the original is already modified.\n- Can lead to unnecessary assignments if not used carefully, potentially creating confusion about whether the list is being mutated or reassigned.\n\n### Convention in Python:\n\nWhile both methods are valid, Method 1 is more idiomatic in Python for functions that are intended to mutate their inputs. Since it's common to mutate data structures like lists or dictionaries directly, it's understood by Python developers that certain functions will have side effects.\n\nHowever, if clarity and explicitness are important, especially in codebases where side effects are less desirable, using Method 2 or even documenting the function's behavior can be beneficial. You might also consider using method names that clearly indicate mutation, such as `modify_list`.\n\nUltimately, the choice between these methods can depend on your specific use case, team conventions, and whether clarity or brevity is more important in the context of your code."
