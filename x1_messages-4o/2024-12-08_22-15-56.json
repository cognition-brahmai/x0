Here are two additional tips to further streamline your kitchen session:\n\n3. **Organize Your Workspace:** Before you start cooking, clear and organize your workspace. Ensure that all your tools, such as measuring cups, spoons, mixing bowls, and baking pans, are within arm's reach. This minimizes the time spent searching for items while cooking.\n\n4. **Batch Clean as You Go:** Instead of letting dirty dishes pile up, wash or rinse them as you finish using them. For example, while something is baking or simmering, take a moment to clean the mixing bowls or utensils you've already used. This keeps your workspace tidy and reduces the cleanup time after cooking."
