I am using the PyPDF2 package (version 1.27.2) and have the following script:\n\n```python\nimport PyPDF2\n\nwith open(\"sample.pdf\", \"rb\") as pdf_file:\n    read_pdf = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(pdf_file)\n    number_of_pages = read_pdf.getNumPages()\n    page = read_pdf.pages[0]\n    page_content = page.extractText()\nprint(page_content)\n```\n\nHowever, when I run the code, the output I get is different from the text included in the PDF document. How can I extract the text as it appears in the PDF document?"

        "content": "When extracting text from a PDF using PyPDF2, you might encounter issues where the extracted text doesn't match the original text in the document. This can happen due to how text is stored in PDFs, which may not be straightforward. Here are some suggestions to improve the text extraction:\n\n1. **Ensure PDF Compatibility**: Ensure that the PDF is not a scanned document or an image-based PDF. PyPDF2 works best with text-based PDFs.\n\n2. **Update to the Latest Version**: Although PyPDF2 is a popular library, consider checking for any more recent updates or bug fixes that might improve text extraction.\n\n3. **Use `extract_text()` Method Correctly**: The method `extractText()` might not work perfectly in every case. Ensure that you're using it correctly:\n\n   ```python\n   page_content = read_pdf.getPage(0).extractText()\n   ```\n\n4. **Try Other Libraries**: If PyPDF2 doesn't meet your needs, consider other libraries like `pdfminer.six` or `PyMuPDF` (Fitz), which often provide better results for text extraction:\n\n   - **Using pdfminer.six**:\n     ```python\n     from pdfminer.high_level import extract_text\n\n     text = extract_text('sample.pdf')\n     print(text)\n     ```\n\n   - **Using PyMuPDF (Fitz)**:\n     ```python\n     import fitz  # PyMuPDF\n\n     with fitz.open(\"sample.pdf\") as doc:\n         text = \"\"\n         for page in doc:\n             text += page.get_text()\n     print(text)\n     ```\n\n5. **Check PDF Structure**: Some PDFs have complex layouts with columns, tables, or non-standard text encoding, which can complicate text extraction. In such cases, tools like Adobe Acrobat or specialized OCR software might be necessary.\n\nBy trying these alternatives, you should be able to extract text more closely resembling the original content in the PDF document."
