Running `docs/ls` shows the expected result: `build  Makefile  source`. When I execute `sphinx-build -d build/doctrees source build/html`, it appears to work as I am able to open the index.html file and see a basic structure of what I'm aiming for. However, when I try to use my actual source code as the `source` folder, I encounter problems. Running `sphinx-build -d build/doctrees ../ys_utils build/html` results in an error, specifically, ImportError: No module named ys_utils along with several other import errors. I am new to this kind of documentation, could you provide some guidance? Additionally, I would like to use a Makefile to handle this. I have two folders in my project: `nextgen/ls` and `docs ys_utils`. I need `nextgen/docs/Makefile` to generate the HTML for `ys_utils` and all other modules I'm going to have."

        "content": "Certainly! It seems like you're trying to document your Python code using Sphinx but are encountering import errors when Sphinx tries to process your code. Let's address this step by step:\n\n### Setting Up Your Environment\n\n1. **Ensure `ys_utils` is accessible:**\n   - To avoid import errors, you need to make sure that your `ys_utils` package is accessible in the Python path when Sphinx runs the build. You can achieve this by setting the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable or by creating a virtual environment where your package is installed.\n\n2. **Creating a Virtual Environment:**\n   ```bash\n   cd nextgen\n   python3 -m venv venv\n   source venv/bin/activate\n   pip install -e .   # This assumes you have a setup.py to install ys_utils\n   ```\n\n3. **Modify Sphinx Configuration:**\n   - In your `conf.py` file located in the `docs/source` directory, add the path to `ys_utils` to `sys.path`. This ensures that Sphinx can import your modules.\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   import sys\n   sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../ys_utils'))\n   ```\n\n### Using a Makefile\n\nThe Makefile is a convenient way to automate the Sphinx build process. Here is a basic Makefile you can use:\n\n```makefile\n# Makefile for Sphinx documentation\n\nSPHINXOPTS    =\nSPHINXBUILD   = sphinx-build\nSOURCEDIR     = source\nBUILDDIR      = build\n\n.PHONY: help clean html\n\nhelp:\n\t@$(SPHINXBUILD) -M help \"$(SOURCEDIR)\" \"$(BUILDDIR)\" $(SPHINXOPTS)\n\nclean:\n\trm -rf $(BUILDDIR)/*\n\nhtml:\n\t@$(SPHINXBUILD) -b html \"$(SOURCEDIR)\" \"$(BUILDDIR)/html\" $(SPHINXOPTS)\n\t@echo \"Build finished. The HTML pages are in $(BUILDDIR)/html.\"\n\n```\n\n### Generating Documentation\n\n1. **Autodoc Extension:**\n   - Ensure you have the `autodoc` extension enabled in your `conf.py`:\n\n   ```python\n   extensions = [\n       'sphinx.ext.autodoc',\n       'sphinx.ext.viewcode',  # Optional: to link to source code\n       # Add any other extensions you need\n   ]\n   ```\n\n2. **Documenting your Code:**\n   - Use `.. automodule::` directives in your reStructuredText (`.rst`) files to automatically document your modules. For example, in `index.rst` or another `.rst` file:\n\n   ```rst\n   .. automodule:: ys_utils\n      :members:\n      :undoc-members:\n      :show-inheritance:\n   ```\n\n3. **Build the Documentation:**\n   - Run the Makefile command to build your documentation:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd docs\n   make html\n   ```\n\n4. **Troubleshoot:**\n   - If you still encounter import errors, double-check the Python path and ensure that `ys_utils` is correctly installed or accessible.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to generate documentation for `ys_utils` and any other modules you have. The Makefile simplifies the process and helps manage builds efficiently. If you have further questions or run into specific issues, feel free to ask!"
