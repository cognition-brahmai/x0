        "content": "Great! Let's dive into a challenging nonlinear system of equations. Here's a set of three equations with three variables:\n\n1. \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 \\)\n2. \\( x^2 + y^2 = 0.5 \\)\n3. \\( x + y + z = 1 \\)\n\nYour task is to find all possible real solutions for \\( (x, y, z) \\) and explain your solution process in detail.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution Process\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze the Equations\n\nFirst, notice that the first two equations involve squares of the variables:\n\n- Equation 1: \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 \\)\n- Equation 2: \\( x^2 + y^2 = 0.5 \\)\n\nFrom Equation 2, we know:\n\n\\[ x^2 + y^2 = 0.5 \\]\n\nSubstitute this into Equation 1:\n\n\\[ 0.5 + z^2 = 1 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ z^2 = 0.5 \\]\n\nSo, \\( z = \\pm \\sqrt{0.5} \\).\n\n#### Step 2: Solve for \\( z \\)\n\nNow we have two possible values for \\( z \\):\n\n- \\( z = \\sqrt{0.5} \\)\n- \\( z = -\\sqrt{0.5} \\)\n\n#### Step 3: Substitute \\( z \\) into the Third Equation\n\nLet's substitute these into the third equation \\( x + y + z = 1 \\) and solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n**Case 1: \\( z = \\sqrt{0.5} \\)**\n\n\\[ x + y + \\sqrt{0.5} = 1 \\]\n\\[ x + y = 1 - \\sqrt{0.5} \\]\n\nFrom Equation 2 \\( x^2 + y^2 = 0.5 \\), let's express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ y = 1 - \\sqrt{0.5} - x \\]\n\nSubstitute into \\( x^2 + y^2 = 0.5 \\):\n\n\\[ x^2 + (1 - \\sqrt{0.5} - x)^2 = 0.5 \\]\n\nSolve this quadratic equation to find the values of \\( x \\) and consequently \\( y \\).\n\n**Case 2: \\( z = -\\sqrt{0.5} \\)**\n\n\\[ x + y - \\sqrt{0.5} = 1 \\]\n\\[ x + y = 1 + \\sqrt{0.5} \\]\n\nSimilarly, substitute \\( y = 1 + \\sqrt{0.5} - x \\) into \\( x^2 + y^2 = 0.5 \\) and solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n### Generalizing the Solution Method\n\nTo handle any nonlinear system of equations with an equal number of variables and equations, you can follow these general steps:\n\n1. **Identify Patterns:** Look for equations that can be combined or simplified, such as equations involving squares or sums.\n\n2. **Substitution:** Solve one equation for one variable in terms of others, and substitute into the other equations. This step can be repeated to reduce the number of variables.\n\n3. **Elimination:** Use elimination techniques to reduce the number of equations and variables.\n\n4. **Iterate and Solve:** Continue this process iteratively until you reduce the system to a solvable form, often a single variable equation.\n\n5. **Back-Substitute:** Once you have solutions for some variables, back-substitute to find the remaining variables.\n\n6. **Verify Solutions:** Always verify your solutions in the original equations to ensure they are correct.\n\nFeel free to attempt solving this system, and if you need any further assistance or confirmation, I'm here to help!"
