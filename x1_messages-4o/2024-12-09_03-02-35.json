        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to an attempt to directly modify the `auto_scroll_threshold` property using JavaScript in a Jupyter Notebook. Unfortunately, this approach won't work as expected because IPython/Jupyter doesn't expose this property in a way that allows direct modification via a simple JavaScript command within the notebook.\n\nHere's an alternative approach you can use to manage the output scrolling in Jupyter Notebooks:\n\n1. **Change the Default Scrolling Behavior**: You can change the default scrolling behavior for all cells in a notebook by modifying the Jupyter Notebook's CSS. The CSS file can be found in the `~/.jupyter` or similar directory on your system. Add the following CSS rule to disable scrolling:\n\n    ```css\n    .output_scroll {\n        overflow-y: visible;\n    }\n    ```\n\n   This change will apply to all notebooks, and you'll need to restart your Jupyter Notebook server for the changes to take effect.\n\n2. **Use IPython Display Functions**: If you want more control over specific cells, you can use IPython's display functions to manage output manually. For instance, you can use HTML and JavaScript to customize output presentation. Here's a basic example:\n\n    ```python\n    from IPython.core.display import display, HTML\n\n    def no_scroll_output():\n        display(HTML(\"<style>.output_scroll { overflow-y: visible; }</style>\"))\n\n    no_scroll_output()\n    ```\n\n    Call the `no_scroll_output()` function before running a cell with long output to disable scrolling for that cell.\n\n3. **Output Widgets**: Consider using IPython widgets to control and display output. Widgets can provide more interactive and customizable interfaces for displaying data.\n\nThese methods allow you to control output scrolling behavior in Jupyter Notebooks more effectively. Remember that modifying notebook CSS or using custom display functions can affect the appearance and behavior of all cells, so use them judiciously."
