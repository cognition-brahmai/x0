        "content": "Your implementation of the binary search algorithm in Java is correct and follows the standard approach. Here's a quick breakdown of how the code works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - `start` is initialized to the first index of the array (`0`).\n   - `end` is initialized to the last index of the array (`arr.length - 1`).\n\n2. **While Loop**: \n   - The loop continues as long as `start` is less than or equal to `end`.\n\n3. **Finding the Middle**:\n   - `mid` is calculated as the average of `start` and `end`. This index is used to check if the `key` is located at, to the left, or to the right of this position.\n\n4. **Comparison**:\n   - If `arr[mid]` equals the `key`, the function returns `mid`, indicating the index where the key is found.\n   - If `arr[mid]` is less than `key`, it means the `key` must be in the right half of the array, so `start` is updated to `mid + 1`.\n   - If `arr[mid]` is greater than `key`, it means the `key` must be in the left half of the array, so `end` is updated to `mid - 1`.\n\n5. **Return**: \n   - If the `key` is not found, the function returns `-1`.\n\nHere's the code you provided, formatted with explanations:\n\n```java\npublic class BinarySearch {\n   \n   // Method to perform binary search\n   public static int binarySearch(int[] arr, int key) {\n      int start = 0;\n      int end = arr.length - 1;\n      \n      while (start <= end) {\n         int mid = (start + end) / 2;\n         \n         // Check if the key is present at mid\n         if (arr[mid] == key) {\n            return mid;\n         } \n         // If key is greater, ignore left half\n         else if (arr[mid] < key) {\n            start = mid + 1;\n         } \n         // If key is smaller, ignore right half\n         else {\n            end = mid - 1;\n         }\n      }\n      // Key not found\n      return -1;\n   }\n   \n   // Main method to test the binary search\n   public static void main(String[] args) {\n      int[] arr = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}; // Sorted array\n      int key = 8; // Element to search\n      int index = binarySearch(arr, key);\n      \n      // Output the result\n      if (index != -1) {\n         System.out.println(\"Element found at index \" + index);\n      } else {\n         System.out.println(\"Element not found\");\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\n\nYou can modify the `arr` and `key` variables in the `main` method to test the binary search with different data. Just ensure that the array is sorted before applying binary search, as the algorithm requires a sorted array to function correctly."
