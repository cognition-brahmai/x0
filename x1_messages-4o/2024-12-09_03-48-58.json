This code was taken from a previous Stack Overflow Q&A, but I suspect it might be outdated. Can anyone help me understand and resolve this issue? Here is the code and the error traceback:\n\nCode:\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\ndef getLength(filename):\n  result = subprocess.Popen([\"ffprobe\", filename],\n    stdout = subprocess.PIPE, stderr = subprocess.STDOUT)\n  return [x for x in result.stdout.readlines() if \"Duration\" in x]\n\nprint(getLength('bell.mp4'))\n```\n\nTraceback:\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"B:\\Program Files\\ffmpeg\\bin\\test3.py\", line 7, in &lt;module&gt;\n    print(getLength('bell.mp4'))\n  File \"B:\\Program Files\\ffmpeg\\bin\\test3.py\", line 6, in getLength\n    return [x for x in result.stdout.readlines() if \"Duration\" in x]\n  File \"B:\\Program Files\\ffmpeg\\bin\\test3.py\", line 6, in &lt;listcomp&gt;\n    return [x for x in result.stdout.readlines() if \"Duration\" in x]\nTypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the `subprocess` module in Python returns output as bytes, whereas string operations such as checking for the substring `\"Duration\"` expect a string. To resolve this issue, you need to decode the byte output into a string before performing any string operations.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can modify your code to fix the `TypeError`:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\ndef getLength(filename):\n    result = subprocess.Popen(\n        [\"ffprobe\", filename],\n        stdout=subprocess.PIPE, \n        stderr=subprocess.STDOUT\n    )\n    \n    # Decode bytes to string\n    output = result.stdout.read().decode('utf-8')\n    \n    # Look for \"Duration\" in the decoded output\n    return [line for line in output.split('\\n') if \"Duration\" in line]\n\nprint(getLength('bell.mp4'))\n```\n\nIn this updated version of the code:\n\n1. **Decoding**: After capturing the `stdout` output from `ffprobe`, decode it using `.decode('utf-8')`. This will convert the bytes output into a string, which can be safely used for string operations.\n\n2. **Reading and Splitting**: Instead of using `readlines()`, which returns a list of lines, use `read()` followed by `split('\\n')` to split the entire output into lines based on newline characters.\n\nThis should resolve the `TypeError` and allow you to correctly search for the \"Duration\" string in the `ffprobe` output."
