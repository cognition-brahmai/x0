However, there's a more straightforward and idiomatic way to achieve the same result using NumPy's `reshape` method:\n\n```python\nk = k.reshape(*k.shape, 1)\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use `numpy.expand_dims`, which is specifically designed to add a new axis to an array:\n\n```python\nk = np.expand_dims(k, axis=-1)\n```\n\nBoth approaches will give you the desired shape `(s1, s2, ..., sn, 1)`. The choice between them can depend on personal preference or readability, but `expand_dims` is often clearer in intent when you're specifically adding an axis."
