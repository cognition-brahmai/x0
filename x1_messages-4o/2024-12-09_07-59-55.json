        "content": "To retrieve version information from the `setup.py` file for your package, you can follow several approaches. Here are a few common methods to achieve this:\n\n1. **Directly Parse `setup.py`:**\n\n   If your `setup.py` defines the version directly as a string, you can parse it using a regular expression. Here is a simple example:\n\n   ```python\n   import re\n\n   with open('setup.py', 'r') as f:\n       content = f.read()\n   \n   version_match = re.search(r\"version\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]([^'\\\"]+)['\\\"]\", content)\n   if version_match:\n       version = version_match.group(1)\n       print(version)\n   else:\n       print(\"Version not found\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Maintain a Separate `version.py`:**\n\n   A common practice is to keep the version information in a separate file like `version.py` within your package, and import it in `setup.py`. This way, you can also easily import the version information elsewhere in your package.\n\n   **version.py:**\n\n   ```python\n   __version__ = '0.1.0'\n   ```\n\n   **setup.py:**\n\n   ```python\n   from my_package.version import __version__\n\n   setup(\n       name='my_package',\n       version=__version__,\n       # other arguments\n   )\n   ```\n\n   To retrieve the version in your scripts, you can simply import it:\n\n   ```python\n   from my_package.version import __version__\n   print(__version__)\n   ```\n\n3. **Use `pkg_resources`:**\n\n   If your package is installed, you can use the `pkg_resources` module to retrieve the version:\n\n   ```python\n   import pkg_resources\n\n   version = pkg_resources.get_distribution('my_package').version\n   print(version)\n   ```\n\n4. **Use `importlib.metadata`:** (Python 3.8+)\n\n   If you are using Python 3.8 or newer, you can use `importlib.metadata` to get the version of your package:\n\n   ```python\n   from importlib.metadata import version\n\n   package_version = version('my_package')\n   print(package_version)\n   ```\n\nEach of these methods has its own use case depending on whether you need the version during development or after installation. Choose the one that best fits your workflow."
