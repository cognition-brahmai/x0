        "content": "The error you're encountering is likely due to compatibility issues between different versions of PyTorch and the `pytorch_pretrained_bert` library, which has since been replaced by the `transformers` library developed by Hugging Face.\n\nHere's how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Update to the Latest Libraries**: First, make sure you have the latest versions of PyTorch and the `transformers` library. You can do this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade torch transformers\n   ```\n\n2. **Update Your Code**: Since `pytorch_pretrained_bert` is deprecated, you should switch to using the `transformers` library. Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n   ```python\n   import torch\n   from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel\n\n   # Load pre-trained model tokenizer (vocabulary)\n   tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')\n\n   # Load pre-trained model (weights)\n   model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')\n   model.eval()\n   ```\n\n3. **Check Your Environment**: Ensure that your environment is not using cached older versions of libraries. You can create a fresh virtual environment and install the required libraries again.\n\n4. **Verify Installation**: After updating, verify the installation by checking the versions:\n\n   ```python\n   import torch\n   import transformers\n\n   print(torch.__version__)\n   print(transformers.__version__)\n   ```\n\n   Ensure that they are compatible with each other. You can refer to the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/) and [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/releases) documentation for version compatibility.\n\nBy following the above steps, you should be able to resolve the `AttributeError` and successfully load and use the BERT model with the `transformers` library."
