        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to Django's `APPEND_SLASH` setting, which is enabled by default. When `APPEND_SLASH` is `True`, Django will automatically append a slash to any URL without one if a URL pattern with a trailing slash exists. This behavior is useful for SEO and consistency in URL handling, but it can cause issues when dealing with POST requests, as the POST data cannot be redirected.\n\nIn your case, the URL you are hitting with your POST request (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/add`) does not match the pattern defined in your URL configuration, which has a trailing slash (`^add/$`). Since Django is trying to redirect the request to the correct URL pattern with the trailing slash, it fails because POST data cannot be redirected.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Correct URL Usage in `curl`:** Make sure that the URL you use in your `curl` request includes the trailing slash. Update your command as follows:\n\n    ```bash\n    curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/add/ -d b=2 >> output.html\n    ```\n\n2. **Disable `APPEND_SLASH` (if necessary):** If you prefer not to use trailing slashes in your URLs, you can disable the `APPEND_SLASH` setting in your Django project's settings file (`settings.py`). However, note that this approach might lead to inconsistencies with URL handling across your project:\n\n    ```python\n    APPEND_SLASH = False\n    ```\n\n3. **Consistent URL Configuration:** Ensure that all URLs in your project are consistently defined, either with or without trailing slashes, depending on your preference and the `APPEND_SLASH` setting.\n\nBy following the first suggestion, you should be able to resolve the issue without changing the `APPEND_SLASH` setting, which is the recommended approach for maintaining consistency and SEO benefits."
