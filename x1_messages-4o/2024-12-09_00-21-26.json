However, I am facing difficulty in linking these conda environments with the Jupyter notebook. I have two kernels, python2 and python3, and when I check sys.executable inside a notebook for the python3 kernel, I get /Users/***/miniconda3/envs/py35/bin/python. But for python2 kernel, I am getting /usr/local/opt/python/bin/python2.7. I want to know how I can set the sys.executable to miniconda env for python2, and how to bind a conda env with a notebook kernel. Also, I would like to know if the command 'source activate py35' has any link with 'jupyter notebook'. I have multiple jupyter bins and only one kernel at /usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/python2 but inside Jupyter, I have two kernels. I am not sure where to find the other kernel. I tried modifying kernel.json from /usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/python2 but it did not change anything."

        "content": "To set up your Jupyter Notebook to use specific conda environments, you need to create kernels for each environment. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n### Setting Up Conda Environments with Jupyter\n\n1. **Activate Your Conda Environment**:\n   First, activate the conda environment you want to link with Jupyter. For example, for `py27`:\n   ```bash\n   conda activate py27\n   ```\n\n2. **Install ipykernel**:\n   Make sure you have `ipykernel` installed in your environment. This package allows you to create a Jupyter kernel.\n   ```bash\n   conda install ipykernel\n   ```\n\n3. **Create a New Kernel**:\n   Run the following command to create a kernel for the activated environment:\n   ```bash\n   python -m ipykernel install --user --name py27 --display-name \"Python 2.7 (py27)\"\n   ```\n   This will create a new kernel named `py27` that you can select in Jupyter Notebook.\n\n4. **Repeat for Other Environments**:\n   Repeat the above steps for your `py35` environment:\n   ```bash\n   conda activate py35\n   conda install ipykernel\n   python -m ipykernel install --user --name py35 --display-name \"Python 3.5 (py35)\"\n   ```\n\n### Understanding Kernel Location\n\n- Jupyter stores kernels in a directory, typically located at:\n  - `~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/` for user-specific installations.\n  - `/usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/` for system-wide installations.\n\n- You can list all installed kernels using the command:\n  ```bash\n  jupyter kernelspec list\n  ```\n\n### Kernel Configuration\n\n- Each kernel has a `kernel.json` file located in its respective directory. This file specifies the path to the Python executable (`argv` field).\n\n- If you have modified `kernel.json` in one location and it didn\u2019t take effect, ensure you are modifying the correct `kernel.json` file for the active kernel.\n\n### Linking 'source activate' with Jupyter\n\n- The command `source activate py35` is used to activate a conda environment in the terminal. It doesn't directly affect Jupyter, but it changes the environment context for any Python processes launched afterward.\n\n- When you launch Jupyter Notebook from an activated environment, it will use the Python version and packages from that environment unless specified otherwise by the kernel you choose in the notebook.\n\n### Cleaning Up Extra Kernels\n\n- If you have duplicate or unwanted kernels, you can remove them by deleting their respective directories in the kernels folder.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to configure Jupyter to use specific conda environments effectively."
