However, when I run the command `$ sudo easy_install pyaudio` in the terminal, the process exits with the error message `command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1`. I tried to solve the problem by installing python-dev as suggested in some online resources, but it didn't work. After installing libportaudio-dev, I'm still facing errors. What could be the problem and how can I resolve it?"

        "content": "Installing PyAudio on an older system like Ubuntu 11.04 can be challenging due to outdated or missing dependencies. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Update System Packages:**\n   Make sure your package list is updated. Run:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Essential Build Tools:**\n   Ensure that you have all the necessary build tools installed:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install build-essential\n   ```\n\n3. **Reinstall Python Development Headers:**\n   You might need the development headers for Python 2.7.1:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install python2.7-dev\n   ```\n\n4. **Install PortAudio Development Libraries:**\n   It seems you've already done this, but ensure it's installed correctly:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install libportaudio0 libportaudio2 libportaudiocpp0\n   ```\n\n5. **Check GCC Installation:**\n   Make sure GCC is installed properly. You can check the version with:\n   ```bash\n   gcc --version\n   ```\n   If it's not installed, you can install it using:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install gcc\n   ```\n\n6. **Install PyAudio Using pip:**\n   Sometimes using `pip` instead of `easy_install` might resolve issues:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install python-pip\n   sudo pip install pyaudio\n   ```\n\n7. **Download and Build from Source:**\n   If the above steps fail, try downloading the PyAudio source code and building it manually:\n   ```bash\n   wget http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/packages/pyaudio-0.2.11.tar.gz\n   tar -xzf pyaudio-0.2.11.tar.gz\n   cd pyaudio-0.2.11\n   python setup.py build\n   sudo python setup.py install\n   ```\n\n8. **Check for Error Logs:**\n   If you encounter any error messages during these steps, examine them closely as they might provide more specific information about what's missing or going wrong.\n\n9. **Consider Upgrading Your System:**\n   Ubuntu 11.04 is quite old, and many packages may no longer be supported. If possible, consider upgrading to a more recent version of Ubuntu to benefit from better support and updated packages.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues, sharing the specific error message can help diagnose the problem further."
