I wrote the following code:\n\n```python\nmyString=\"I want to Remove all white \\t spaces, new lines \\n and tabs \\t\"\nmyString = myString.strip(' \\n\\t')\nprint myString\n```\n\nHowever, the output I am getting is:\n\n```python\nI want to Remove all white   spaces, new lines \nand tabs\n```\n\nIt seems like a simple task, but I am missing something. Should I be importing a module or library to accomplish this?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is due to the fact that `strip()` only removes whitespace characters from the beginning and the end of the string, not from the middle. To remove all whitespace, tabs, and newlines from the entire string, you can use `replace()` method or a regular expression.\n\nHere's how you can do it using `replace()` method:\n\n```python\nmyString = \"I want to Remove all white \\t spaces, new lines \\n and tabs \\t\"\nmyString = myString.replace(' ', '').replace('\\t', '').replace('\\n', '')\nprint myString\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `re` module to remove all whitespace characters:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nmyString = \"I want to Remove all white \\t spaces, new lines \\n and tabs \\t\"\nmyString = re.sub(r'\\s+', '', myString)\nprint myString\n```\n\nIn the second method, `\\s` is a regular expression pattern that matches any whitespace character, including spaces, tabs, and newlines. The `+` quantifier ensures that all contiguous whitespace is replaced with an empty string. This should give you the desired result."
