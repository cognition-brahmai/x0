Here's a step-by-step guide to accomplish this:\n\n### Step 1: Install Git\nIf you haven't already, install Git on your system. You can download it from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/).\n\n### Step 2: Initialize a Git Repository\nNavigate to your project directory and initialize a Git repository.\n\n```bash\ncd your_project_directory\ngit init\n```\n\n### Step 3: Add Files to the Repository\nAdd your project files to the Git repository.\n\n```bash\ngit add .\n```\n\n### Step 4: Commit the Initial Version\nCommit the current state of your code.\n\n```bash\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit\"\n```\n\n### Step 5: Identify Irrelevant Lines\nOpen your code in an editor and manually review the lines you consider irrelevant. Make a note of these lines or comment them out for easy identification.\n\n### Step 6: Remove Irrelevant Lines\nEdit the files to remove or modify the irrelevant lines. Save your changes.\n\n### Step 7: Stage the Changes\nStage the modified files for the next commit.\n\n```bash\ngit add .\n```\n\n### Step 8: Commit the Changes\nCommit your changes with a descriptive message.\n\n```bash\ngit commit -m \"Remove irrelevant lines from the code\"\n```\n\n### Step 9: Review Changes\nYou can review the changes between commits using the Git diff command.\n\n```bash\ngit diff HEAD^ HEAD\n```\n\n### Step 10: Create a Branch (Optional)\nIf you want to maintain the original code and the modified version separately, create a new branch for the changes.\n\n```bash\ngit checkout -b cleanup\n```\n\n### Step 11: Merge Changes (Optional)\nIf you created a branch, you can later merge the changes back to the main branch after verifying everything.\n\n```bash\ngit checkout main\ngit merge cleanup\n```\n\n### Step 12: Push Changes to Remote Repository (Optional)\nIf you're using a remote repository like GitHub, push your changes.\n\n```bash\ngit remote add origin [your_remote_repository_URL]\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\n### Tips:\n- Use descriptive commit messages to easily track changes.\n- Regularly commit changes to keep track of your progress.\n- Consider using Git tools like `git blame` to track the origin of specific lines of code, which may help identify irrelevant lines.\n\nBy following this process, you can effectively use Git to manage and clean up your codebase."
