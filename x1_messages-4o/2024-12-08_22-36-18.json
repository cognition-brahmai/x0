The condition that led her to check the tires to ensure they were properly inflated could have been her awareness of the importance of tire maintenance for a smooth and safe ride. Properly inflated tires ensure better control, efficiency, and reduce the risk of flats or accidents. Therefore, the missing step was likely her routine safety check, which might have included verifying tire pressure, checking for any visible damage, and ensuring her bike was in good working order."
