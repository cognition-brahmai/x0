However, I'm having difficulty finding any tools or plugins that can accomplish this. What solutions or options are available for this?"

        "content": "To enhance your experience with static type checking and improve IntelliSense in Visual Studio Code when working with Python, there are several tools and strategies you can employ. Here\u2019s a comprehensive list to get you started:\n\n1. **Pylance**: Pylance is a Visual Studio Code extension that provides fast, feature-rich language support for Python. It offers excellent IntelliSense capabilities, type checking, and type inference. You can install it directly from the Visual Studio Code extensions marketplace.\n\n2. **Mypy**: Mypy is a static type checker for Python. You can integrate it into your development workflow to check your code for type consistency. To use Mypy, install it via pip (`pip install mypy`) and then run it against your Python files. You can also configure VS Code to run Mypy automatically by adding it to your `tasks.json`.\n\n3. **Pyright**: Pyright is a static type checker and language server for Python, developed by Microsoft. It powers Pylance and can also be used as a standalone tool. Pyright provides fast type checking and supports type annotations effectively. You can install Pyright using npm (`npm install -g pyright`) and run it from the command line or set it up in VS Code.\n\n4. **Type Annotations**: Make sure you're using Python's built-in typing module effectively by annotating your functions and variables. This will help the tools mentioned above provide more precise type checking and IntelliSense.\n\n5. **Settings in VS Code**:\n   - Ensure that the Python extension is installed and configured correctly in VS Code.\n   - In your workspace settings or `settings.json`, you can specify which type checker to use. For example, for Mypy, you can add:\n     ```json\n     \"python.linting.mypyEnabled\": true,\n     \"python.linting.enabled\": true\n     ```\n   - You can also adjust settings specific to Pylance or Pyright to tailor the type checking and IntelliSense experience to your liking.\n\n6. **Continuous Integration**: Consider integrating MyPy or Pyright into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure type consistency across your codebase.\n\nUsing these tools and configurations, you can significantly improve the static type checking and IntelliSense capabilities in your Python projects, bringing your experience closer to that of TypeScript development."
