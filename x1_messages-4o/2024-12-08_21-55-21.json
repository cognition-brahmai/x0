        "content": "To develop an efficient sorting algorithm that can handle a large dataset, we should consider implementing a sorting algorithm with an average time complexity of O(n log n). One of the most commonly used efficient algorithms is Merge Sort or Quick Sort. Here, I'll implement Merge Sort, which is a stable sorting algorithm with a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n).\n\nHere is the Python program using Merge Sort:\n\n```python\ndef merge_sort(arr):\n    if len(arr) > 1:\n        # Finding the middle of the array\n        mid = len(arr) // 2\n\n        # Dividing the elements into 2 halves\n        left_half = arr[:mid]\n        right_half = arr[mid:]\n\n        # Recursively sorting the first half\n        merge_sort(left_half)\n\n        # Recursively sorting the second half\n        merge_sort(right_half)\n\n        i = j = k = 0\n\n        # Copy data to temporary arrays L[] and R[]\n        while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):\n            if left_half[i] < right_half[j]:\n                arr[k] = left_half[i]\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                arr[k] = right_half[j]\n                j += 1\n            k += 1\n\n        # Checking if any element was left\n        while i < len(left_half):\n            arr[k] = left_half[i]\n            i += 1\n            k += 1\n\n        while j < len(right_half):\n            arr[k] = right_half[j]\n            j += 1\n            k += 1\n\ndef main():\n    # The set of values to sort\n    values = [10, 11, 8, 12, 7]\n\n    print(\"Original array:\", values)\n    merge_sort(values)\n    print(\"Sorted array:\", values)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Time Complexity Analysis\n\n**Merge Sort Time Complexity:**\n- Best Case: O(n log n)\n- Average Case: O(n log n)\n- Worst Case: O(n log n)\n\n**Space Complexity:**\n- O(n) due to the additional space required for the left and right halves.\n\n**Why Merge Sort?**\n- Merge Sort is an efficient, stable, and divide-and-conquer algorithm.\n- It divides the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.\n- It is particularly suitable for large datasets due to its predictable O(n log n) time complexity in all cases.\n\nThis program should efficiently handle even large datasets, like a million integers, due to its O(n log n) time complexity."
