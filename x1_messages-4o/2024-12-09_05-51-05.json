For example, I tried the following code:\n\n<pre><code>rr, tt = [i*10, i*12 for i in xrange(4)]\n</code></pre>\n\nI want 'rr' and 'tt' to be separate lists containing results from 'i*10' and 'i*12' respectively. However, this doesn't seem to work. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "In Python, list comprehensions are designed to create a single list. However, you can achieve the effect of returning two separate lists by using a slightly different approach. You can use two separate list comprehensions or use a loop to populate two lists. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Using Two Separate List Comprehensions\n\nYou can create two separate lists by using two list comprehensions:\n\n```python\nrr = [i * 10 for i in range(4)]\ntt = [i * 12 for i in range(4)]\n\nprint(rr)  # Output: [0, 10, 20, 30]\nprint(tt)  # Output: [0, 12, 24, 36]\n```\n\n### Using a Single Loop\n\nAlternatively, you can use a single loop to populate both lists:\n\n```python\nrr, tt = [], []\nfor i in range(4):\n    rr.append(i * 10)\n    tt.append(i * 12)\n\nprint(rr)  # Output: [0, 10, 20, 30]\nprint(tt)  # Output: [0, 12, 24, 36]\n```\n\nBoth methods will give you two separate lists, `rr` and `tt`, containing the desired values. Note that the `range()` function is used instead of `xrange()` as `xrange()` is not available in Python 3. If you are using Python 2, you can replace `range()` with `xrange()`."
