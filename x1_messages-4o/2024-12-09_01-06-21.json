        "content": "To modify the default prompt behavior in `Virtualenvwrapper`, you'll need to customize the `postactivate` script of your virtual environment. By default, when you activate a virtual environment using `workon <_name_of_env_>`, it appends the environment name to the beginning of your prompt. Here's how you can change this behavior:\n\n1. **Locate the Virtual Environment**:\n   First, find where your virtual environments are stored. This is typically in the `WORKON_HOME` directory. You can check its location by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   echo $WORKON_HOME\n   ```\n\n   By default, this might be `~/.virtualenvs`.\n\n2. **Navigate to Your Specific Environment**:\n   Go to the directory of the environment you wish to modify:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd $WORKON_HOME/<_name_of_env_>\n   ```\n\n3. **Edit the `postactivate` Script**:\n   If the `postactivate` script does not exist, you can create it. This script is executed every time the virtual environment is activated.\n\n   ```bash\n   nano bin/postactivate\n   ```\n\n   Add the following line to customize the prompt as desired. For example, if you want to prepend the environment name with a specific string or remove it entirely, you could do:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PS1=\"(MyCustomPrompt) $PS1\"\n   ```\n\n   Or if you want to remove it completely and just use your default prompt:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PS1=\"\\u@\\h:\\w\\$ \"\n   ```\n\n   You can modify `PS1` to whatever prompt format you prefer.\n\n4. **Edit the `deactivate` Script** (Optional):\n   If you made changes to the `PS1` in `postactivate`, you might want to restore the original prompt when deactivating the environment. You can do this by editing the `deactivate` script:\n\n   ```bash\n   nano bin/deactivate\n   ```\n\n   Add a line to restore the original prompt:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PS1=\"$OLD_PS1\"\n   ```\n\n   Before you modify `PS1` in `postactivate`, you should save the original value:\n\n   ```bash\n   export OLD_PS1=\"$PS1\"\n   export PS1=\"(MyCustomPrompt) $PS1\"\n   ```\n\n5. **Test Your Changes**:\n   Reactivate your virtual environment to test the changes:\n\n   ```bash\n   workon <_name_of_env_>\n   ```\n\n   Your terminal prompt should now reflect the modifications you've made.\n\nBy customizing the `postactivate` and `deactivate` scripts, you can control how your terminal prompt displays when you're working within specific virtual environments."
