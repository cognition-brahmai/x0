I am interested to know if the dataclass is compatible with the property decorator for defining getter and setter functions for the data elements of the dataclass. Is there any documentation available for this or any examples that I can refer to?"

        "content": "Yes, Python's `dataclass` is compatible with the `property` decorator, allowing you to define getter and setter functions for its fields. This feature can be particularly useful if you need to add some logic when accessing or modifying the values of your data class's fields.\n\nHere's a simple example to demonstrate how you can use the `property` decorator with a `dataclass`:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\n\n@dataclass\nclass Product:\n    name: str\n    _price: float = field(repr=False)\n\n    @property\n    def price(self):\n        return self._price\n\n    @price.setter\n    def price(self, value):\n        if value < 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Price cannot be negative\")\n        self._price = value\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"Product(name={self.name}, price={self.price})\"\n\n# Usage\nproduct = Product(name=\"Laptop\", _price=1000)\nprint(product)  # Output: Product(name=Laptop, price=1000)\n\nproduct.price = 1200\nprint(product.price)  # Output: 1200\n\ntry:\n    product.price = -500  # This will raise a ValueError\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(e)  # Output: Price cannot be negative\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Product` class is a data class with a `name` and a `_price` field. The `_price` field is private (indicated by the underscore prefix) and is not included in the `repr` output by default due to `repr=False`. The `price` property is defined with a getter and a setter. The setter includes validation to ensure that the price is not negative.\n\nThis approach allows you to add additional logic to your data class fields while still benefiting from the simplicity and readability of data classes. As for documentation, you can refer to the official Python documentation on data classes and properties:\n\n- [Data Classes Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/dataclasses.html)\n- [Properties Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property)\n\nThese resources provide comprehensive information on how to utilize data classes and properties effectively."
