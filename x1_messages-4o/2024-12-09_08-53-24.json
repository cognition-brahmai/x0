        "content": "Yes, it's definitely possible to create an algorithm to find the first non-repeating character in a given string. Here's a simple approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Use a Hash Map (or Dictionary):** You can use a hash map to store the frequency of each character in the string.\n\n2. **Iterate Through the String:** First, iterate through the string and populate the hash map with the frequency of each character.\n\n3. **Find the First Non-Repeating Character:** Iterate through the string again, and for each character, check its frequency in the hash map. The first character with a frequency of 1 is your answer.\n\nHere's a sample Python implementation of the algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef first_non_repeating_character(s):\n    # Step 1: Create a frequency dictionary\n    char_frequency = {}\n    \n    # Step 2: Populate the frequency dictionary\n    for char in s:\n        if char in char_frequency:\n            char_frequency[char] += 1\n        else:\n            char_frequency[char] = 1\n    \n    # Step 3: Find the first non-repeating character\n    for char in s:\n        if char_frequency[char] == 1:\n            return char\n    \n    return None  # Return None if there's no non-repeating character\n\n# Example usage\nstring = \"swiss\"\nresult = first_non_repeating_character(string)\nif result:\n    print(f\"The first non-repeating character is: {result}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"There is no non-repeating character in the string.\")\n```\n\nThis algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the string, as it involves two passes through the string. The space complexity is O(1) if we consider the hash map to have a fixed size due to the limited number of unique characters (e.g., 26 for lowercase English letters)."
