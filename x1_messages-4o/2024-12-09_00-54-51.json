        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"Wrong continued indentation before block,\" indicates that the continuation line of your code is not indented according to PEP 8, which is the style guide for Python code. Pylint is flagging this as a bad continuation line because the indentation doesn\u2019t align with its expectations.\n\nIn Python, when breaking a line inside a parenthesis, bracket, or brace, you should align the continued line with the opening delimiter or use an extra level of indentation. Here's how you can fix the indentation issue in your code:\n\n```python\nif len(remaining_obj_list) > 0:\n    for i in a_list:\n        this_time = self.__get_time(i)\n        for remaining_obj in remaining_obj_list:\n            if (remaining_obj.get_time() +\n                    this_time <= self.max):  # Align with the opening parenthesis\n                i.append(remaining_obj)\n                remaining_obj.set_used(True)\n        if 0 == len(self.__get_unused_list):\n            break\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, the continuation line:\n\n```python\nthis_time <= self.max):\n```\n\nis aligned with the opening parenthesis of the `if` condition line. This aligns with PEP 8's recommendation to either align with the delimiter or use a hanging indent (an additional level of indentation) to make the code more readable and consistent."
