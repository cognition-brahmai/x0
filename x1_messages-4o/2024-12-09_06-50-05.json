Here's a simple example demonstrating how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\n\n# Get the full path of the currently running script\nfull_path = os.path.abspath(sys.argv[0])\n\n# Get the directory name and the script name\ndirectory = os.path.dirname(full_path)\nscript_name = os.path.basename(full_path)\n\nprint(f\"running from {directory}\")\nprint(f\"file is {script_name}\")\n```\n\nWhen you run this script from the command line, it will output the directory from which the script is being executed and the script's file name. This should produce the desired output similar to your example:\n\n```bash\n$ pwd\n/tmp\n$ python baz.py\nrunning from /tmp\nfile is baz.py\n```\n\nThis solution makes use of `os.path.abspath()` to get the absolute path of the script and `os.path.dirname()` and `os.path.basename()` to extract the directory and file name, respectively."
