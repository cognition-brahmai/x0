For instance, I have a simple list named 'all' which is always consecutively ordered like this: all = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]. I also have current = 4. I want to modify the 'all' list such that it removes the 'current' number and the one before it. The output should be: altered = [ 1, 2, 5, 6 ]. The 'current' can also be 1 and 0, and I want to ensure that it doesn't throw an error for these two values. For instance, when current = 0, the altered list should be: altered = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]. In this case, current = 0 simply removes the last number. I am looking for a solution, possibly using generators, and ideally in a single line of code. \nAs a side note, if the current = 0 is too much trouble, then it could also be current = -1 or current = 7. Additionally, it should also handle the case for current = 1, which should give the output: altered = [ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]."

        "content": "You can achieve this by using list slicing and a conditional approach to handle the different scenarios you've described. Here's a single line of code that removes the specified range from the list:\n\n```python\nall = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\ncurrent = 4  # You can change this to test other scenarios\n\naltered = all[:max(0, current-2)] + all[min(len(all), current):]\nprint(altered)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Slicing with Conditions:**\n   - `all[:max(0, current-2)]` handles the case where `current` is less than or equal to 1, ensuring that you don't attempt to access negative indices.\n   - `all[min(len(all), current):]` ensures that when `current` is beyond the last index, it doesn't try to access out-of-bound indices.\n\n2. **Handling Edge Cases:**\n   - When `current = 0`, the slice `all[:max(0, -2)]` results in an empty list, and `all[len(all):]` effectively removes the last element.\n   - When `current = 1`, the slice `all[:0]` is an empty list, so `all[1:]` returns all elements from index 1 onwards.\n\nThis solution should work for all the scenarios you've described, including `current` being 0, 1, or larger than the list length. Adjust the `current` variable to test different cases."
