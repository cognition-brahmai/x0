        "content": "To define a function that returns a list of directories containing files from specific sub-folders within a given source directory, you can use Python's `os` and `os.path` modules. Here's a step-by-step guide along with a sample implementation:\n\n1. **Import Necessary Modules**: Use `os` to navigate through directories and `os.path` to check if paths are directories or files.\n\n2. **Define the Function**: Create a function that accepts the source directory and an optional list of specific sub-folder names you want to include.\n\n3. **Iterate Through Directories**: Use `os.walk()` to traverse the directory tree.\n\n4. **Filter Sub-Folders**: If specific sub-folders are specified, filter to include only those.\n\n5. **Check for Files**: For each sub-folder, check if it contains any files.\n\n6. **Return the List**: Collect directories that meet the criteria and return them as a list.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef get_directories_with_files(source_directory, specific_subfolders=None):\n    directories_with_files = []\n\n    for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk(source_directory):\n        # If specific subfolders are provided, filter the directories\n        if specific_subfolders is not None:\n            dirnames[:] = [d for d in dirnames if d in specific_subfolders]\n\n        # If there are any files in the current directory\n        if filenames:\n            directories_with_files.append(dirpath)\n\n    return directories_with_files\n\n# Example usage:\nsource_dir = '/path/to/source/directory'\nspecific_subfolders = ['subfolder1', 'subfolder2']\ndirectories = get_directories_with_files(source_dir, specific_subfolders)\nprint(directories)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`os.walk()`**: This generates the file names in a directory tree, walking either top-down or bottom-up.\n  \n- **`dirpath, dirnames, filenames`**: These are the current directory path, directories in the current path, and files in the current path, respectively.\n\n- **`dirnames[:]`**: This modifies the list of directories in-place to filter the ones specified in `specific_subfolders`.\n\n- **`if filenames:`**: This checks if the current directory contains any files. If so, it adds the directory path to the list.\n\nThis function will provide you with a list of directories that contain files and, if specified, are within the provided sub-folders. Remember to replace `'/path/to/source/directory'` and `['subfolder1', 'subfolder2']` with your actual directory path and sub-folder names."
