Whenever I try to access attributes from the package or import them, I encounter issues. In the first instance, I tried to use `requests.get` but received an `AttributeError: module 'requests' has no attribute 'get'`. In the second instance, I tried to import `get` from `requests` but got an `ImportError: cannot import name 'get'`. Similarly, when I tried to import a module from inside the `requests` package, I got an `ImportError: No module named 'requests.auth'; 'requests' is not a package`. What is causing these issues and how can I resolve them?\n\nHere are the pieces of code I tried and the errors they produced:\n\n1. `AttributeError`:\n```python\nimport requests\n\nres = requests.get('http://www.google.ca')\nprint(res)\n\n\"\"\"\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Users/me/dev/rough/requests.py\", line 1, in <module>\n    import requests\n  File \"/Users/me/dev/rough/requests.py\", line 3, in <module>\n    requests.get('http://www.google.ca')\nAttributeError: module 'requests' has no attribute 'get'\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n2. `ImportError`:\n\n```python\nfrom requests import get\n\nres = get('http://www.google.ca')\nprint(res)\n\n\"\"\"\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"requests.py\", line 1, in <module>\n    from requests import get\n  File \"/Users/me/dev/rough/requests.py\", line 1, in <module>\n    from requests import get\nImportError: cannot import name 'get'\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n3.

        "content": "The issues you're encountering are due to naming your script `requests.py`. When you import the `requests` package in your script, Python is mistakenly trying to import your script file (`requests.py`) instead of the actual `requests` library.\n\nHere's how you can resolve these issues:\n\n1. **Rename Your Script**:\n   - Change the name of your script from `requests.py` to something else, such as `my_script.py` or `api_requests.py`. This will prevent the name conflict with the `requests` library.\n\n2. **Remove Compiled Files**:\n   - After renaming, make sure to delete any compiled Python files that may have been created with the old name, such as `requests.pyc` or the `__pycache__` directory that might still be present. These can cause Python to still reference the old filename.\n\n3. **Verify Installation**:\n   - Ensure that the `requests` library is installed in your Python environment. You can do this by running `pip show requests` in your terminal. If it\u2019s not installed, you can install it using `pip install requests`.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how your updated script might look:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\nres = requests.get('http://www.google.ca')\nprint(res.status_code)\n```\n\nBy renaming your script and ensuring there are no residual files with the name `requests`, Python will correctly import the `requests` library, and your code should work as expected."
