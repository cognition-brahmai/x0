I am currently trying to add additional functionality to the class by generating stubs only once for the entire set of tests. However, I am encountering a `TypeError: __init__() takes 1 argument (2 given)` when I run my test script using `python -m unittest -v test`. I am unable to use `setUpClass()` as I am working on Python 2.4. Here is the current code I have:\n\n```python\n#filename test.py\n\nclass TestingClass(unittest.TestCase):\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.gen_stubs()\n\n    def gen_stubs(self):\n        # Create a couple of tempfiles/dirs etc etc.\n        self.tempdir = tempfile.mkdtemp()\n        # more stuff here\n```\n\nWhat could be the issue and how can I resolve it?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that the `unittest.TestCase` class's `__init__()` method expects to receive a `methodName` argument, which specifies the test method to be executed. In your current implementation, you're overriding the `__init__()` method without calling the superclass's `__init__()` method, and you're not accepting the `methodName` parameter, which leads to the `TypeError`.\n\nTo resolve this, you should override the `__init__()` method properly by accepting the `methodName` parameter and passing it to the superclass's `__init__()` method. Also, since you're working with Python 2.4, you need to ensure compatibility with the older version. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\nimport tempfile\n\nclass TestingClass(unittest.TestCase):\n\n    def __init__(self, methodName='runTest'):\n        super(TestingClass, self).__init__(methodName)\n        self.gen_stubs()\n\n    def gen_stubs(self):\n        # Create a couple of tempfiles/dirs etc etc.\n        self.tempdir = tempfile.mkdtemp()\n        # more stuff here\n\n    # Example test method\n    def test_something(self):\n        # Use self.tempdir in your tests\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Method Signature**: Update the `__init__()` method to accept the `methodName` parameter with a default value of `'runTest'`.\n2. **Superclass Initialization**: Call `super(TestingClass, self).__init__(methodName)` to ensure proper initialization of the `unittest.TestCase`.\n3. **Python 2.4 Compatibility**: The `super()` function is used in a way that is compatible with Python 2.4.\n\nWith these changes, your custom initialization logic should work correctly, and the `TypeError` should be resolved. This allows you to generate stubs or perform other setup tasks once when the test case instance is initialized."
