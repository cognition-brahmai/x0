However, when I try to do this, I get a pair of sentences instead of words. For example, given the list of sentences `text = ['cant railway station','citadel hotel',' police stn']`, when I run the code:\n\n```python\ntext2 = [[word for word in line.split()] for line in text]\nbigrams = nltk.bigrams(text2)\nprint(bigrams)\n```\nI get the output: `[(['cant', 'railway', 'station'], ['citadel', 'hotel']), (['citadel', 'hotel'], ['police', 'stn'])]`. This is not what I want. I want the output to be: `[([cant],[railway]),([railway],[station]),([citadel,hotel]), and so on...]`. The last word of the first sentence should not merge with the first word of the second sentence. How can I modify my code to get the desired output?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired output of bigrams at the word level within each sentence, rather than generating bigrams across sentences, you need to generate bigrams for each individual sentence separately. Here is how you can modify your code to accomplish this:\n\n```python\nimport nltk\n\ntext = ['cant railway station', 'citadel hotel', 'police stn']\n\n# Tokenize each sentence into words\ntext2 = [line.split() for line in text]\n\n# Generate bigrams for each sentence\nbigrams_list = [list(nltk.bigrams(sentence)) for sentence in text2]\n\n# Flatten the list of bigrams for output\nflattened_bigrams = [bigram for sublist in bigrams_list for bigram in sublist]\n\nprint(flattened_bigrams)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Tokenization**: Each sentence is split into words using `split()`, creating a list of lists where each sublist contains the words of a sentence.\n- **Generating Bigrams**: Use `nltk.bigrams()` on each list of words (each sentence) to generate bigrams.\n- **Flattening**: The `bigrams_list` is a list of lists of bigrams. Use list comprehension to flatten this into a single list of bigrams for easier viewing or processing.\n\nWith this code, you'll get the bigrams for each sentence separately, avoiding any merging of words from different sentences. The output will look like this:\n\n```\n[('cant', 'railway'), ('railway', 'station'), ('citadel', 'hotel'), ('police', 'stn')]\n```\n\nThis matches the format you are aiming for, where bigrams are formed only within the boundaries of each sentence."
