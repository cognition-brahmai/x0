Let's denote the designers as follows:\n\n- Stella McCartney\n- Ralph Lauren\n- The designer who created the iconic \"little black dress\"\n- The designer who pioneered the \"wrap dress\"\n- Calvin Klein\n- Giorgio Armani\n\nLet's analyze the clues:\n\n1. Stella McCartney won her first major fashion award 2 years before the designer who created the iconic \"little black dress\". (This means that Stella McCartney's win comes before the \"little black dress\" designer.)\n\n2. Ralph Lauren won his first major fashion award 1 year before the designer who pioneered the \"wrap dress\". (Ralph Lauren's win comes before the \"wrap dress\" designer.)\n\n3. The designer who created the iconic \"little black dress\" won their first major fashion award 4 years before Calvin Klein. (This means that Calvin Klein's win comes 4 years after the \"little black dress\" designer.)\n\n4. The designer who pioneered the \"wrap dress\" won their first major fashion award 3 years after Giorgio Armani. (This means Giorgio Armani's win comes before the \"wrap dress\" designer.)\n\n5. Calvin Klein won his first major fashion award 5 years after the designer who created the iconic \"little black dress\". (This confirms the time difference between Calvin Klein and the \"little black dress\" designer.)\n\nFrom these clues, we can deduce the order:\n\n1. Giorgio Armani (since he is before the \"wrap dress\" designer and there is no indication he is later than anyone else)\n2. Ralph Lauren (since Ralph Lauren is before the \"wrap dress\" designer, but after Giorgio Armani)\n3. Stella McCartney (since she is 2 years before the \"little black dress\" designer; she must be before them)\n4. Designer who created the iconic \"little black dress\"\n5. Designer who pioneered the \"wrap dress\" (since they are 3 years after Giorgio Armani and after Ralph Lauren)\n6. Calvin Klein (since he is 4 years after the \"little black dress\" designer)\n\nTherefore, the correct order from earliest to latest is:\n1. Giorgio Armani\n2. Ralph Lauren\n3. Stella McCartney\n4. Designer who created the iconic \"little black dress\"\n5. Designer who pioneered the \"wrap dress\"\n6. Calvin Klein"
