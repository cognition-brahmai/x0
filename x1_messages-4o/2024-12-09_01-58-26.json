        "content": "The `SyntaxError` you're encountering with f-strings in your Python code is likely due to using a Python version that does not support f-strings. F-strings were introduced in Python 3.6, so if you're using an older version of Python, you'll encounter this syntax error.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you should:\n\n1. **Check Your Python Version**: Ensure you're using Python 3.6 or later. You can check your Python version by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   ```\n\n   or, if you have multiple versions, you might need to use:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 --version\n   ```\n\n2. **Upgrade Python**: If your Python version is older than 3.6, you'll need to upgrade it. You can download the latest version of Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it.\n\n3. **Configure Atom to Use the Correct Python Version**: If you have multiple Python versions installed, make sure Atom is configured to use the right one. You might need to adjust your Atom configuration or specify the full path to the correct Python interpreter in your script execution settings.\n\nOnce you've ensured that you're using Python 3.6 or later, your f-string syntax should work correctly without any syntax errors."
