I am trying to instantiate a class in my CUDA code where some of its members can be shared with other threads in the same block. The code I am trying to compile is as follows:\n\n```c++\nclass SharedSomething {\npublic:\n    __shared__ int i; // this is not allowed\n};\n\n__global__ void run() {\n    SharedSomething something;\n}\n```\n\nHowever, when I compile it, I receive the error: \"attribute \"shared\" does not apply here\" (nvcc version 4.2). What is the reason for this and is there a workaround to achieve the desired behavior of sharing members of a class across one block?"

        "content": "In CUDA, the `__shared__` memory qualifier is used to declare shared memory that is accessible by all threads in the same block. However, you cannot directly apply the `__shared__` qualifier to class member variables as you attempted in your class `SharedSomething`. The reason is that `__shared__` memory must be allocated in the scope of a kernel and not within a class or object instance.\n\nHere's a workable approach to achieve your goal:\n\n1. **Declare Shared Memory Separately**: Declare shared memory outside of any class, within the kernel itself. You can then pass this shared memory to the class or use it directly within the kernel.\n\n2. **Use a Kernel to Manage Shared Memory**: You can encapsulate your class operations in such a way that it utilizes the shared memory declared in the kernel.\n\nHere is how you can modify your code to work correctly:\n\n```c++\nclass SharedSomething {\npublic:\n    int* shared_i;\n\n    __device__ void setSharedI(int* sharedMem) {\n        shared_i = sharedMem;\n    }\n\n    __device__ void doSomething() {\n        // Example operation on shared memory\n        *shared_i = threadIdx.x;\n    }\n};\n\n__global__ void run() {\n    // Declare shared memory\n    __shared__ int shared_i;\n    \n    SharedSomething something;\n    something.setSharedI(&shared_i);\n\n    // Perform operations using shared memory\n    something.doSomething();\n\n    // Synchronize threads to ensure all operations on shared memory are complete\n    __syncthreads();\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Declare Shared Memory in Kernel**: Shared memory is declared using `__shared__` within the kernel, not inside a class or object.\n\n- **Pass Shared Memory to Class**: Pass a pointer to the shared memory to the class method(s) that need to use it.\n\n- **Synchronize Threads**: Use `__syncthreads()` to ensure all threads have completed their operations on shared memory before proceeding, as shared memory is shared across all threads in a block.\n\nBy following this pattern, you can effectively utilize shared memory with classes in CUDA, ensuring that the shared data is accessible and modifiable by all threads within a block."
