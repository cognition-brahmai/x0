Here are some options:\n\n1. **Keyboard Shortcut**:\n   - On Windows/Linux: Press `Ctrl + Alt + Left Arrow` to go back and `Ctrl + Alt + Right Arrow` to go forward.\n   - On macOS: Press `Command + Option + Left Arrow` to go back and `Command + Option + Right Arrow` to go forward.\n\n2. **Navigation Bar**:\n   - You can also use the navigation bar at the top of the editor to move between recently viewed files. Click on the filename to see a dropdown of the recent files and navigate back to any previous file.\n\n3. **Navigate Menu**:\n   - Go to `Navigate` > `Back` in the menu to return to the previous location. You can also find the \"Forward\" option here to move forward.\n\n4. **Recent Files**:\n   - Press `Ctrl + E` (Windows/Linux) or `Command + E` (macOS) to open the \"Recent Files\" popup, and navigate to the file you want to return to.\n\nThese methods should help you efficiently navigate through your code in PyCharm, mimicking the back and forward functionality found in Eclipse."
