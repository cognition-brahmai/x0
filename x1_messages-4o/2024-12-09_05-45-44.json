For organization, I've defined utility MySQL-related functions in a separate file. However, they all use a common variable, the cursor object from the MySQLdb module, which I originally defined inside the utilities module. I realized later that the cursor object, which is used to communicate with the db server, should be defined in the main module, so that both the main module and anything that is imported into it can access that object. \n\nHere is a simplified version of my main module and utility module:\n\nUtilities_module.py:\n```python\ndef utility_1(args):\n    code which references a variable named \"cur\"\ndef utility_n(args):\n    etcetera\n```\n\nProgram.py:\n```python\nimport MySQLdb, Tkinter\ndb=MySQLdb.connect(#blahblah) ; cur=db.cursor()  #cur is defined!\nfrom utilities_module import *\n```\n\nHowever, when I try to call any of the utilities functions, I get a \"global name not defined\" error. I tried to solve this by importing \"cur\" from the main program in the utilities module, but that led to a cyclic import and crashes. \n\nSo, how can I make the \"cur\" object, defined in the main module, visible to those auxiliary functions which are imported into it?"

        "content": "To make the `cur` object from your main module accessible to the utility functions without causing cyclic imports, you can pass the `cur` object as an argument to the utility functions. This approach avoids the need for global variables and keeps your code modular and easy to maintain.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n### Utilities_module.py\nModify the utility functions to accept a `cur` argument:\n\n```python\ndef utility_1(cur, args):\n    # Use the cur object here\n    # Example: cur.execute(\"SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE some_column=%s\", (args,))\n    pass\n\ndef utility_n(cur, args):\n    # Additional utilities using cur\n    pass\n```\n\n### Program.py\nPass the `cur` object when calling the utility functions:\n\n```python\nimport MySQLdb\nfrom utilities_module import utility_1, utility_n\n\n# Establish database connection and create a cursor\ndb = MySQLdb.connect(host='your_host', user='your_user', passwd='your_pass', db='your_db')\ncur = db.cursor()\n\n# Use the utility functions by passing the cursor\nutility_1(cur, 'some_argument')\nutility_n(cur, 'another_argument')\n\n# Don't forget to close the cursor and the connection when done\ncur.close()\ndb.close()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Pass the Cursor**: By passing the `cur` object as an argument to the utility functions, you avoid any need for cyclic imports or global variables.\n- **Modular Code**: This approach keeps your utility module functions flexible and reusable. They can work with any cursor object you provide.\n- **Avoiding Globals**: It eliminates potential side effects and makes the code easier to understand and test.\n\nThis way, you maintain clean separation between your main module and the utility module while ensuring that the utility functions have access to the necessary MySQL cursor object."
