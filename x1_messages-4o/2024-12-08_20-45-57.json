You need to add a new requirement to the existing task of extracting specific information from the table named Inventory, which contains important data such as the quantity and price of various products. Please write a SQL query to find the products that meet the criteria of having a quantity greater than 15, a price less than 250, and a product name that starts with the letter 'S'. You have to be more analytical in finding the data you need from the table. Best of luck to you!"

        "content": "Certainly! To accomplish this task, we need to construct a SQL query that filters the table named \"Inventory\" based on the specified criteria: quantity greater than 15, price less than 250, and a product name starting with the letter 'S'. Here's the SQL query to achieve that:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM Inventory\nWHERE quantity > 15\n  AND price < 250\n  AND product_name LIKE 'S%';\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`SELECT *`**: This selects all columns from the table, but you can modify it to select specific columns if needed.\n- **`FROM Inventory`**: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data.\n- **`WHERE`**: This clause is used to filter records based on specific conditions.\n  - **`quantity > 15`**: This condition ensures that only products with a quantity greater than 15 are selected.\n  - **`price < 250`**: This condition filters for products with a price less than 250.\n  - **`product_name LIKE 'S%'`**: This condition filters for products whose names start with the letter 'S'. The `%` is a wildcard character that matches any sequence of characters following 'S'.\n\nThis query will return all records from the \"Inventory\" table that meet all three criteria. You can adjust the selected columns or add additional conditions as necessary for your specific use case."
