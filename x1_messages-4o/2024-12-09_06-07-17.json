When I save the image after converting it to grayscale using the convert('L') method, the image appears as expected. However, when I try to convert the image to a monochrome, single-band image using convert('1') method, I get a noisy image. Is there a simple way to convert a color png image into a pure black and white image using PIL or Python?\nThe code I am using is as below:\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image \nimport ImageEnhance\nimport ImageFilter\nfrom scipy.misc import imsave\nimage_file = Image.open(\"convert_image.png\") # open colour image\nimage_file= image_file.convert('L') # convert image to monochrome - this works\nimage_file= image_file.convert('1') # convert image to black and white\nimsave('result_col.png', image_file)\n```\nThe original and converted images can be seen below:\n![Original Image](https://i.imgur.com/mB96s.png)\n![Converted Image](https://i.imgur.com/O5HoK.png)"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing arises from the way the `convert('1')` method works in PIL. When you convert an image to mode '1', it uses a fixed threshold to decide if a pixel should be black or white, and this can result in a noisy image if the threshold is not suitable for your specific image. To achieve better results, you can manually apply a threshold that fits your image's characteristics more appropriately. Follow the steps below to implement this:\n\n1. Convert the image to grayscale using `convert('L')`.\n2. Apply a custom threshold to decide the pixel values for the black and white image.\n\nHere's how you can do it with PIL:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\n\n# Open the color image\nimage_file = Image.open(\"convert_image.png\")\n\n# Convert the image to grayscale\ngray_image = image_file.convert('L')\n\n# Define a threshold value. This can be adjusted depending on your image.\nthreshold = 128\n\n# Apply the threshold to convert to black and white\nmonochrome_image = gray_image.point(lambda x: 255 if x > threshold else 0, '1')\n\n# Save the result\nmonochrome_image.save('result_col.png')\n```\n\nIn this code, the `point` method is used to apply a lambda function that converts each pixel to either 255 (white) or 0 (black) based on the threshold. You can adjust the `threshold` value to get the desired result depending on the specific characteristics of your image.\n\nNote: The `scipy.misc.imsave` function is deprecated, and it's better to use `save` method provided by PIL as shown above."
