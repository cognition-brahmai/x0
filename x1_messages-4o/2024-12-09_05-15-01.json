I've tried using the following codes:\n\n```markdown\nLink to [Notebook 2](files/notebook2.ipynb)\n```\nand\n\n```html\nLink to <a href=\"files/notebook2.ipynb\">Notebook 2</a>\n```\n\nBut when I click the link, a new tab opens displaying the raw, unformatted contents of the ipynb file. Is there a way to make IPython open the linked notebook in a new tab for use, rather than displaying its raw contents?"

        "content": "To create a hyperlink in a Markdown cell of an IPython (Jupyter) notebook that opens another notebook in a new tab for interactive use, you need to use a URL that Jupyter recognizes for navigating between notebooks. The issue you're encountering is because the links are pointing directly to the file rather than through Jupyter's interface.\n\nHere's how you can create such a link:\n\n1. **Using a Relative Path:**\n   If the notebook is in the same directory or a relative path from your current notebook, you can use a relative path like this:\n\n   ```markdown\n   [Link to Notebook 2](./notebook2.ipynb)\n   ```\n\n2. **Using Jupyter\u2019s Internal Links:**\n   Alternatively, you can use Jupyter\u2019s internal URL structure to ensure it opens properly. This assumes Jupyter's file structure and URLs are being properly set up by the server. For instance, if your notebook is located in the root directory of Jupyter, you can use:\n\n   ```markdown\n   [Link to Notebook 2](notebooks/notebook2.ipynb)\n   ```\n\n3. **Opening in a New Tab:**\n   If you want the link to open in a new tab, you cannot directly specify this in Markdown. Instead, you would need to use HTML with a target attribute:\n\n   ```html\n   <a href=\"notebooks/notebook2.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">Link to Notebook 2</a>\n   ```\n\nMake sure to adjust the path according to where your notebook is located relative to the current notebook. Also, note that these methods assume that your Jupyter notebook server is correctly serving the notebook files, and that they are accessible via the URLs you are creating. If the server setup is different or security settings restrict such operations, you might need to adjust accordingly."
