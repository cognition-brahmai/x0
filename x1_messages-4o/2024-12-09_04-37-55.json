        "content": "The issue you're facing is likely due to the fact that the directory added to your PATH is incorrect for accessing the `sphinx-build` executable. The `sphinx-build` command is typically installed in the `Scripts` directory of your Python installation, not in the `site-packages` directory.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Find the correct Scripts directory:**\n   Locate the directory where Python's executables are stored. When you install Python via Chocolatey, this is usually within the `Scripts` directory inside the Python installation folder. You can find it by following these steps:\n\n   - Open your command prompt and run the following command to determine the Python installation path:\n     ```bash\n     python -c \"import sys; print(sys.executable)\"\n     ```\n   - This command will output the path to the Python executable, something like `C:\\Program Files\\Python39\\python.exe`. The `Scripts` folder should be in the same directory as the Python executable, i.e., `C:\\Program Files\\Python39\\Scripts`.\n\n2. **Add the correct directory to your PATH:**\n   Add the `Scripts` directory to your system\u2019s PATH environment variable.\n\n   - Search for \"Environment Variables\" in your Windows search bar and select \"Edit the system environment variables.\"\n   - Click on the \"Environment Variables\" button.\n   - In the \"System variables\" section, find and select the \"Path\" variable, then click \"Edit.\"\n   - Click \"New\" and add the path to your Python `Scripts` directory (e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\Python39\\Scripts`).\n   - Click OK to close all dialog boxes.\n\n3. **Verify the PATH change:**\n   - Open a new command prompt (you need to open a new one to load the updated PATH) and run:\n     ```bash\n     sphinx-build --version\n     ```\n   - This should correctly display the version of Sphinx, indicating that the `sphinx-build` command is recognized.\n\nIf you follow these steps and ensure the correct directory is added to your PATH, you should be able to run `sphinx-build` successfully."
