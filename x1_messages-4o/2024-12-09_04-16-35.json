        "content": "To write a function in Python using Selenium to wait until a table with a specific class identifier is loaded, you can utilize Selenium's `WebDriverWait` along with `expected_conditions`. This allows you to wait for a certain condition to be true before proceeding with your code. In this case, you'll be waiting for the presence of a table with a specific class name.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide with a sample function to achieve this:\n\n1. **Install Selenium**: Make sure you have Selenium installed in your Python environment. You can install it via pip if you haven't already:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install selenium\n   ```\n\n2. **Import Necessary Modules**: You'll need to import `WebDriverWait` and `expected_conditions` along with other necessary modules from Selenium.\n\n3. **Write the Function**: Use `WebDriverWait` and `EC` (expected conditions) to wait for the table to be present in the DOM.\n\nHere's a sample code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.by import By\nfrom selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait\nfrom selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC\n\ndef wait_for_table_to_load(driver, class_name, timeout=10):\n    \"\"\"\n    Waits for a table with the given class_name to be present in the DOM.\n\n    :param driver: The WebDriver instance.\n    :param class_name: The class name of the table to wait for.\n    :param timeout: Maximum time to wait for the table in seconds.\n    :return: The WebElement of the table if found, None otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Wait for the table to be present in the DOM\n        table = WebDriverWait(driver, timeout).until(\n            EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, class_name))\n        )\n        return table\n    except TimeoutException:\n        print(f\"Table with class name '{class_name}' was not found within {timeout} seconds.\")\n        return None\n\n# Example usage:\n# driver = webdriver.Chrome()  # Initialize your WebDriver (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, etc.)\n# driver.get('URL_OF_YOUR_PAGE')  # Replace with the URL of the page you're testing\n# table = wait_for_table_to_load(driver, 'your-table-class', timeout=10)\n# if table:\n#     print(\"Table is loaded and ready for interaction.\")\n# else:\n#     print(\"Failed to load the table.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **WebDriverWait**: This is used to wait for a certain condition to be met within a specified timeout period.\n- **expected_conditions.presence_of_element_located**: This condition is satisfied when an element is present in the DOM of a page. It does not necessarily mean that the element is visible.\n- **By.CLASS_NAME**: This is used to specify the method of locating the element. In this case, it's by class name.\n\nMake sure you replace `'your-table-class'` with the actual class name of the table you are waiting for. Adjust the `timeout` value as needed based on how long you expect the table to take to load."
