        "content": "I am trying to set up Python logging to multiple handlers, each with different log levels. I have installed a package and I have the following requirements for logging: no print statements, everything goes through logging, log using a `timedRotatingFileHandler` always at DEBUG level, log using a `mailinglogger.SummarisingLogger` always at INFO level, and log to console with level set by default to INFO or overridden through a command-line option. However, I am facing a problem where I can change the log level through the command-line and the console log level changes accordingly, but the other handlers also change, which I don't want. Can anyone help me understand the precedence between the root logger's level, other loggers' level and handlers' level settings in a logging config file? Here is some sample code I am using."

        "content": "To achieve the desired logging setup where different handlers have distinct log levels, it's important to understand how Python's logging system works regarding logger and handler levels. Here's a breakdown of how to configure logging as per your requirements:\n\n1. **Logger Level vs Handler Level**:\n   - The logger's level acts as a global filter for all its handlers. If a log message does not meet the logger's level, it won't be passed to any of its handlers.\n   - Each handler can also have its own level, serving as a second filter. A log message must pass both the logger's level and the handler's level to be processed by that handler.\n\n2. **Configuration**:\n   - Set the root logger's level to the lowest level you need across all handlers (e.g., DEBUG if you want the `TimedRotatingFileHandler` to log DEBUG messages).\n   - Set individual handler levels to control what they actually log.\n\nHere's a sample configuration using Python's `logging` module to meet your requirements:\n\n```python\nimport logging\nimport logging.config\nfrom logging.handlers import TimedRotatingFileHandler\nfrom mailinglogger import SummarisingLogger\n\n# Function to set up logging\ndef setup_logging(console_level=logging.INFO):\n    # Create a root logger\n    logger = logging.getLogger()\n    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)  # Set to the lowest level needed\n\n    # TimedRotatingFileHandler at DEBUG level\n    file_handler = TimedRotatingFileHandler('debug.log', when='midnight', interval=1)\n    file_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n    file_formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n    file_handler.setFormatter(file_formatter)\n    logger.addHandler(file_handler)\n\n    # SummarisingLogger at INFO level\n    mail_handler = SummarisingLogger('youremail@example.com', subject='Log Summary', send_empty=False)\n    mail_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)\n    mail_formatter = logging.Formatter('%(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n    mail_handler.setFormatter(mail_formatter)\n    logger.addHandler(mail_handler)\n\n    # Console handler with level set via parameter\n    console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\n    console_handler.setLevel(console_level)\n    console_formatter = logging.Formatter('%(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n    console_handler.setFormatter(console_formatter)\n    logger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\n# Example command-line level override\nimport sys\nif '--debug' in sys.argv:\n    console_log_level = logging.DEBUG\nelse:\n    console_log_level = logging.INFO\n\n# Setup logging with the desired console log level\nsetup_logging(console_level=console_log_level)\n\n# Example log messages\nlogging.debug('This is a debug message')\nlogging.info('This is an info message')\nlogging.error('This is an error message')\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Root Logger Level**: Set to `DEBUG` to allow all messages through to handlers.\n- **Handler Levels**: Set explicitly to filter messages per handler.\n- **Console Level Override**: Adjusted via command-line argument, affecting only the console handler.\n\nThis setup ensures that each handler logs messages according to its specific level setting, while the console level can be dynamically adjusted without affecting other handlers."
