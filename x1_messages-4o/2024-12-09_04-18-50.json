Initially, it requested VC++ 14.0 but I had 14.1 (with VS2017), so I installed VC++2015 BuildTools which include 14.0. This seemed to work until the library creation part. At this point, I encountered a new error: `LINK : fatal error LNK1158: cannot run 'rc.exe' error: command 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\\VC\\BIN\\link.exe' failed with exit status 1158`. Can anyone tell me what might be missing in my installation or how to resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, `LINK : fatal error LNK1158: cannot run 'rc.exe'`, typically indicates that the Resource Compiler (`rc.exe`) is missing or not found in the system's PATH. This usually happens when the Windows SDK hasn't been installed correctly, or its installation path isn't included in your system's PATH environment variable.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify Windows SDK Installation**:\n   - Make sure that the Windows SDK is installed on your system. You can do this by checking if `rc.exe` exists in the SDK folders, typically located in `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\bin\\<version>\\x86` or `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\8.1\\bin\\x86`.\n\n2. **Add to PATH**:\n   - If you find `rc.exe`, ensure that the directory containing it is included in your system's PATH environment variable.\n   - To do this:\n     1. Right-click on \"This PC\" or \"My Computer\" and click on \"Properties\".\n     2. Click on \"Advanced system settings\".\n     3. Click on \"Environment Variables\".\n     4. Under \"System variables\", look for the \"Path\" variable, select it, and click \"Edit\".\n     5. Add the path to the directory containing `rc.exe`, such as `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\bin\\<version>\\x86`.\n\n3. **Reinstall/Repair Visual Studio Components**:\n   - Sometimes, a repair of the Visual Studio installation can resolve missing components. Open the Visual Studio Installer, find your installation, and use the \"Modify\" or \"Repair\" options to ensure that all necessary components, including the Windows SDK, are installed.\n\n4. **Install the Correct Version of the Windows SDK**:\n   - If you don't have the correct version, you can download and install the Windows 10 SDK separately from the [Microsoft website](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/).\n\n5. **Check for Conflicting PATH Entries**:\n   - Ensure there are no conflicting or duplicate entries in your PATH that might override the correct path to `rc.exe`.\n\nOnce you have ensured that `rc.exe` is properly accessible, try running the `pip install` command again. This should help resolve the issue and allow the installation to complete successfully."
