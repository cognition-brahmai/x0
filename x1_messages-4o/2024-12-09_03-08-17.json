I am not able to find any APIs or classes for doing this as most of the resources I found are for Windows. If a language-specific solution is required, I would prefer it to be in C/C++, but a solution in Python would be acceptable as well. Can someone guide me on this?"

        "content": "Creating a system tray application on Linux that displays a popup box when you hover over the tray icon can be achieved using various libraries, depending on your preferred programming language. Below, I'll outline two approaches: one using C/C++ with GTK, and another using Python with PyGTK or PyQt.\n\n### C/C++ with GTK\n\n1. **Install GTK:**\n   Ensure you have GTK installed on your system. You might need to install development packages like `libgtk-3-dev`.\n\n2. **Create a Simple GTK Application:**\n   Here's a basic outline of how you can set up a system tray icon with a tooltip using GTK in C.\n\n   ```c\n   #include <gtk/gtk.h>\n\n   static void activate(GtkApplication *app, gpointer user_data) {\n       GtkStatusIcon *tray_icon = gtk_status_icon_new_from_icon_name(\"your-icon-name\");\n       gtk_status_icon_set_tooltip_text(tray_icon, \"Your Tooltip Text\");\n   }\n\n   int main(int argc, char **argv) {\n       GtkApplication *app;\n       int status;\n\n       app = gtk_application_new(\"com.example.trayapp\", G_APPLICATION_FLAGS_NONE);\n       g_signal_connect(app, \"activate\", G_CALLBACK(activate), NULL);\n\n       status = g_application_run(G_APPLICATION(app), argc, argv);\n       g_object_unref(app);\n\n       return status;\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Compile and Run:**\n   Compile the program using `gcc`:\n\n   ```bash\n   gcc `pkg-config --cflags gtk+-3.0` -o trayapp trayapp.c `pkg-config --libs gtk+-3.0`\n   ./trayapp\n   ```\n\n### Python with PyGTK or PyQt\n\n#### Using PyGTK:\n\n1. **Install PyGTK:**\n   If PyGTK is not installed, you can typically install it using your package manager or via pip.\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install python-gtk2\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a Simple Tray Application:**\n\n   ```python\n   import gtk\n\n   def main():\n       tray = gtk.StatusIcon()\n       tray.set_from_icon_name(\"your-icon-name\")\n       tray.set_tooltip_text(\"Your Tooltip Text\")\n       gtk.main()\n\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       main()\n   ```\n\n#### Using PyQt:\n\n1. **Install PyQt:**\n   Install PyQt5 using pip if it's not already installed:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install PyQt5\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a Simple Tray Application:**\n\n   ```python\n   from PyQt5 import QtWidgets\n   import sys\n\n   def main():\n       app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)\n       tray_icon = QtWidgets.QSystemTrayIcon(QtWidgets.QApplication.style().standardIcon(QtWidgets.QStyle.SP_ComputerIcon))\n       tray_icon.setToolTip(\"Your Tooltip Text\")\n       tray_icon.show()\n       sys.exit(app.exec_())\n\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       main()\n   ```\n\n### Note:\n\n- Replace `\"your-icon-name\"` with the name of an icon available on your system or provide a path to a custom icon.\n- PyGTK is somewhat deprecated, so PyQt or PyGObject (GTK3) is recommended for newer developments.\n- Ensure the necessary libraries and dependencies are installed on your system for these examples to work.\n\nThese are basic examples to get you started. You can further expand on them to add more features like context menus or actions triggered by clicks on the tray icon."
