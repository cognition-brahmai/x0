However, I am struggling with representing it in a relative frequency format where I want the y-axis to show fractions or percentages. I tried using the normed=1 argument but the fractions it gives are too high and sometimes exceed 1. They also seem to depend on the bin size, as if they are not normalized by the bin size. However, when I set cumulative=1, it sums up to 1 correctly. What am I missing here? Here is my code:\n\n```python\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.add_subplot(111)\nn, bins, patches = ax.hist(mydata, bins=100, normed=1, cumulative=0)\nax.set_xlabel('Bins', size=20)\nax.set_ylabel('Frequency', size=20)\nax.legend\n\nplt.show()\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to the `normed` parameter in the `hist()` function, which has been deprecated in favor of the `density` parameter in recent versions of Matplotlib. This change addresses the problem of normalization that you are experiencing.\n\nWhen you use `density=True`, the area under the histogram will sum to 1, meaning the y-axis will represent a probability density function rather than a simple count. However, this still doesn't directly provide the relative frequency (as a fraction of the total count) that you might be looking for.\n\nTo get the y-axis to show relative frequencies (or percentages), you can manually calculate the frequencies by dividing the counts by the total number of data points. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Sample data\nmydata = [1.5, 2.3, 3.7, 4.1, 5.2, 6.8, 7.9, 8.4, 9.0]\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.add_subplot(111)\n\n# Calculate the histogram\ncounts, bins, patches = ax.hist(mydata, bins=100, density=False)\n\n# Convert counts to relative frequencies\nrelative_frequencies = counts / counts.sum()\n\n# Plot the histogram with relative frequencies\nax.clear()\nax.hist(bins[:-1], bins, weights=relative_frequencies)\n\n# Set labels and show plot\nax.set_xlabel('Bins', size=20)\nax.set_ylabel('Relative Frequency', size=20)\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis code calculates the counts for each bin and then normalizes these counts by dividing by the total number of data points to get the relative frequency. The histogram is then plotted using these relative frequencies as weights.\n\nIf you want to represent the relative frequencies as percentages, multiply `relative_frequencies` by 100 before plotting."
