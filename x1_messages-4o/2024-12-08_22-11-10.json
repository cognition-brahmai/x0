        "content": "A triangle is a three-sided polygon that can be classified based on its angles and sides. Here are the classifications:\n\n### Based on Angles:\n1. **Acute Triangle**: All three angles are less than 90 degrees.\n2. **Right Triangle**: One angle is exactly 90 degrees.\n3. **Obtuse Triangle**: One angle is greater than 90 degrees.\n\n### Based on Sides:\n1. **Equilateral Triangle**: All three sides are of equal length, and all angles are 60 degrees.\n2. **Isosceles Triangle**: Two sides are of equal length, and the angles opposite these sides are equal.\n3. **Scalene Triangle**: All sides and angles are of different lengths and degrees.\n\n### Formulas:\n\n1. **Perimeter of a Triangle**:\n   - For any triangle, the perimeter \\( P \\) is the sum of its sides:\n     \\[\n     P = a + b + c\n     \\]\n   - Where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.\n\n2. **Area of a Triangle**:\n   - For any triangle, the area \\( A \\) can be calculated using Heron's formula:\n     \\[\n     A = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}\n     \\]\n     - Where \\( s \\) is the semi-perimeter, calculated as \\( s = \\frac{a + b + c}{2} \\).\n\n   - Alternatively, if the base \\( b \\) and height \\( h \\) are known:\n     \\[\n     A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times b \\times h\n     \\]\n\nThese formulas and classifications allow for a comprehensive understanding of a triangle based on its sides and angles."
