From the documentation, my understanding is that using the `shutil.rmtree(path)` function will only delete the directory specified, not the entire path. For instance, if I use `shutil.rmtree('user/tester/noob')`, it would only delete the 'noob' directory, not the entire path. Could anyone tell me if my understanding is correct?"

        "content": "Yes, your understanding is correct. The `shutil.rmtree(path)` function in Python is used to delete an entire directory tree at the specified path. When you call `shutil.rmtree('user/tester/noob')`, it will delete the 'noob' directory and all of its contents, including any subdirectories and files within it. However, it will not affect the parent directories ('user' and 'tester' in your example). Those directories will remain intact. The function only removes the directory specified by the `path` and everything within it, not the entire path leading up to it."
