        "content": "To calculate the weighted average of the list `[12, 34, 56, 75]` with the weights determined by the inverse of the square root of each number's position, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the weights** based on the inverse of the square root of the position:\n   - Position 1: Weight = \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1}} = 1 \\)\n   - Position 2: Weight = \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 0.7071 \\)\n   - Position 3: Weight = \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 0.5774 \\)\n   - Position 4: Weight = \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4}} = 0.5 \\)\n\n2. **Normalize the weights** so that their sum equals 1. First, calculate the total sum of the weights:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Weight} = 1 + 0.7071 + 0.5774 + 0.5 \\approx 2.7845\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the normalized weights**:\n   - For position 1: Normalized Weight = \\( \\frac{1}{2.7845} \\approx 0.3591 \\)\n   - For position 2: Normalized Weight = \\( \\frac{0.7071}{2.7845} \\approx 0.2540 \\)\n   - For position 3: Normalized Weight = \\( \\frac{0.5774}{2.7845} \\approx 0.2074 \\)\n   - For position 4: Normalized Weight = \\( \\frac{0.5}{2.7845} \\approx 0.1795 \\)\n\n4. **Calculate the weighted average** using the normalized weights and the values in the list:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weighted Average} = (12 \\times 0.3591) + (34 \\times 0.2540) + (56 \\times 0.2074) + (75 \\times 0.1795)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 4.3092 + 8.6360 + 11.6144 + 13.4625\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\approx 38.0221\n   \\]\n\nSo, the weighted average of the list `[12, 34, 56, 75]` with the given weights is approximately \\( 38.0221 \\)."
