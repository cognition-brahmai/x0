        "content": "How can I efficiently filter rows in a Pandas dataframe so that a specific string column contains at least one of a list of provided substrings? The substrings may contain unusual or regex characters, but the comparison should not use regex and should be case insensitive. My current method uses a mask with the logical_or.reduce function, but my dataframe is large (~1 million rows) and the list of substrings has a length of 100. Here's what I'm currently doing:\n\n```python\nlst = ['kdSj;af-!?', 'aBC+dsfa?\\-', 'sdKaJg|dksaf-*']\nmask = np.logical_or.reduce([df[col].str.contains(i, regex=False, case=False) for i in lst])\ndf = df[mask]\n```\nIs there a more efficient way to do this, such that if the first item in the list is found, we should not have to test any subsequent strings for that row?"

        "content": "To improve the efficiency of filtering rows in a large Pandas DataFrame based on whether a specific string column contains at least one of a list of substrings (without using regex and with case insensitivity), you can use the `.apply` method with a custom function. This approach will short-circuit as soon as a match is found for each row, potentially speeding up the process significantly when compared to checking all substrings for every row.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample dataframe\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    'col': [\n        'This is a test kdSj;af-!?',\n        'Another row with aBC+dsfa?-',\n        'No match here',\n        'Yet another sdKaJg|dksaf-* row',\n        'Completely unrelated'\n    ]\n})\n\n# List of substrings to search for\nlst = ['kdSj;af-!?', 'aBC+dsfa?\\-', 'sdKaJg|dksaf-*']\n\n# Define a function to check if any of the substrings are in the given text\ndef contains_any(text, substrings):\n    text_lower = text.lower()\n    return any(substring.lower() in text_lower for substring in substrings)\n\n# Apply the function to filter the DataFrame\nmask = df['col'].apply(lambda x: contains_any(x, lst))\nfiltered_df = df[mask]\n\nprint(filtered_df)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Custom Function**: `contains_any` takes a text string and a list of substrings. It converts the text to lowercase and checks if any of the lowercase substrings are present, short-circuiting as soon as a match is found, which can save time.\n\n2. **Apply Method**: The `.apply()` method is used to apply this custom function to each row in the specified column. This approach will stop checking for further substrings once a match is found, which can reduce the number of checks needed, especially beneficial when the list of substrings is long.\n\n3. **Performance**: While this approach leverages Python looping and may not be as fast as native vectorized operations, the short-circuiting logic can be more efficient in practice for large lists of substrings, especially if matches are found early in the list.\n\nThis method should be more efficient than using `np.logical_or.reduce`, especially for large DataFrames and long lists of substrings."
