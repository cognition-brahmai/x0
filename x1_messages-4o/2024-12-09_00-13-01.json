For instance, how can I generate a 128-bit prime number that satisfies this condition?\nIn Latex code, the condition can be expressed as:\np > 3 + (11 * 13)\nAnd the prime number should have a length of 128 bits."

        "content": "To generate a random prime number of a given length in Swift, while ensuring it satisfies the condition \\( p > 3 + (11 \\times 13) \\), you can follow these steps. The condition simplifies to \\( p > 146 \\).\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to generate a 128-bit prime number:\n\n1. **Generate a Random Number**: Create a random 128-bit number. Ensure that it is greater than 146.\n\n2. **Check for Primality**: Verify if the generated number is prime. You can use the Miller-Rabin primality test or any other efficient primality test.\n\n3. **Repeat if Necessary**: If the generated number is not prime, repeat the process until you find a prime number.\n\nHere is a sample code in Swift:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\nimport CryptoKit\n\nfunc generateRandom128BitPrime() -> UInt128? {\n    let threshold: UInt128 = 146\n    \n    while true {\n        // Generate a random 128-bit number\n        let randomBytes = (0..<16).map { _ in UInt8.random(in: 0...255) }\n        var randomNumber = UInt128(bigEndian: randomBytes.withUnsafeBytes { $0.load(as: UInt128.self) })\n        \n        // Ensure the number is greater than the threshold\n        if randomNumber <= threshold {\n            continue\n        }\n        \n        // Check if the number is prime\n        if isPrime(randomNumber) {\n            return randomNumber\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to check if a number is prime\nfunc isPrime(_ n: UInt128) -> Bool {\n    if n <= 3 {\n        return n > 1\n    }\n    if n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0 {\n        return false\n    }\n    var i: UInt128 = 5\n    while i * i <= n {\n        if n % i == 0 || n % (i + 2) == 0 {\n            return false\n        }\n        i += 6\n    }\n    return true\n}\n\n// Usage\nif let primeNumber = generateRandom128BitPrime() {\n    print(\"Generated 128-bit prime number: \\(primeNumber)\")\n} else {\n    print(\"Failed to generate a prime number.\")\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n\n- **Random Number Generation**: We generate 128 random bits and convert them into a `UInt128` number.\n  \n- **Primality Test**: We use a basic trial division method for primality testing. For larger numbers, a more efficient method like the Miller-Rabin test is recommended for better performance.\n\n- **Loop Until Prime**: We repeat the process until a prime number is found.\n\nThis approach ensures that the generated number is a prime and satisfies the condition \\( p > 146 \\). For a real-world application, you might want to use optimized libraries or frameworks that handle big integers and provide faster primality tests."
