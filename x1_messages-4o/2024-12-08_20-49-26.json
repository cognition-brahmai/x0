Here\u2019s a high-level overview of how you could build such an app, along with an example of JavaScript code to get you started:\n\n### Step-by-step Guide\n\n1. **Data Collection:**\n   - Collect data on restaurants, including menu items, ambiance, noise levels, cost, reviews, and availability of private dining areas.\n   - You might use APIs from services like Yelp, Google Places, or Zomato to gather this data.\n\n2. **Backend Development:**\n   - Create a backend server using Node.js, Express, or another framework to handle requests and manage data.\n   - Implement a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) to store and query restaurant data.\n\n3. **Frontend Development:**\n   - Use a front-end framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js to build the user interface.\n   - Allow users to input their dietary requirements, party size, and other preferences.\n\n4. **Filtering Logic:**\n   - Implement filtering logic to process user inputs and query the database for matching restaurants.\n   - Consider using machine learning algorithms for better recommendations based on user preferences and past behavior.\n\n5. **Recommendation Algorithm:**\n   - Use a multi-criteria decision-making approach to weigh different factors (like cost, reviews, ambiance) based on user preferences.\n   - Rank the restaurants accordingly and present them to the user.\n\n6. **Private Dining Information:**\n   - Include a field in your database for private dining areas and ensure your filtering logic considers this.\n\n### Sample JavaScript Code\n\nBelow is a simplified example of how you might start implementing some of this functionality using Node.js and a mock database:\n\n```javascript\n// Mock Data\nconst restaurants = [\n    {\n        name: \"The Green Table\",\n        menu: [\"vegan\", \"vegetarian\", \"gluten-free\"],\n        ambiance: \"cozy\",\n        noiseLevel: \"low\",\n        cost: \"$$\",\n        reviews: 4.5,\n        privateDining: true,\n    },\n    {\n        name: \"Steak House\",\n        menu: [\"meat\", \"gluten\"],\n        ambiance: \"lively\",\n        noiseLevel: \"high\",\n        cost: \"$$$\",\n        reviews: 4.0,\n        privateDining: false,\n    },\n    // Add more restaurant data as needed\n];\n\n// Function to filter restaurants\nfunction recommendRestaurants(dietaryRequirements, partySize, preferences) {\n    return restaurants.filter(restaurant => {\n        const matchesDiet = dietaryRequirements.every(req =>\n            restaurant.menu.includes(req)\n        );\n        const matchesAmbiance = preferences.ambiance === restaurant.ambiance;\n        const matchesNoise = preferences.noiseLevel === restaurant.noiseLevel;\n        const isCostEffective = restaurant.cost <= preferences.maxCost;\n        const hasPrivateDining = !preferences.privateDining || restaurant.privateDining;\n\n        return matchesDiet && matchesAmbiance && matchesNoise && isCostEffective && hasPrivateDining;\n    });\n}\n\n// Sample Usage\nconst userPreferences = {\n    dietaryRequirements: [\"vegan\"],\n    partySize: 4,\n    preferences: {\n        ambiance: \"cozy\",\n        noiseLevel: \"low\",\n        maxCost: \"$$\",\n        privateDining: true,\n    },\n};\n\nconst recommendations = recommendRestaurants(userPreferences.dietaryRequirements, userPreferences.partySize, userPreferences.preferences);\nconsole.log(\"Recommended Restaurants:\", recommendations);\n```\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **API Integration:** Implement APIs for real-time data fetching and updates.\n- **User Interface:** Enhance the UI to allow users to input their preferences easily.\n- **Machine Learning:** Implement machine learning models to improve recommendation accuracy over time.\n- **Testing:** Thoroughly test the app to ensure it handles various inputs and edge cases effectively.\n\nThis example provides a basic starting point. Real-world implementation would need to handle more complexity, including asynchronous data fetching, user authentication, and more sophisticated filtering logic."
