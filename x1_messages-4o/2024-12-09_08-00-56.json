I attempted to do this using the list comprehension method `df = [str(i) for i in df]`, but it erased all my data except for the column names. When I tried `df = [str(i) for i in df.values]`, it turned the entire DataFrame into one large list, which is not what I want as I need to export the DataFrame to my Oracle table."

This function applies a given function to each element of the DataFrame. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming 'df' is your DataFrame\ndf = df.applymap(lambda x: str(x) if not isinstance(x, str) else x)\n```\n\nThis code checks each element in the DataFrame to see if it is not a string. If it is not, it converts it to a string using `str(x)`. If it is already a string, it leaves it unchanged.\n\nAfter applying this transformation, your DataFrame will have all its elements as strings, and you can proceed to export it to your Oracle table."
