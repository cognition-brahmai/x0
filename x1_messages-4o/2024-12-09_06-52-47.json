The Flask app runs fine on the Raspberry Pi and displays \"running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/\". However, when I try to access this address using Chrome on my laptop, I receive an \"ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED\" error. I can access 127.0.0.1:5000 on the Raspberry Pi's browser without any issues. How can I fix this issue and connect to the Flask web service from another computer?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that the Flask development server is binding to the local interface (`127.0.0.1`), which is accessible only from the Raspberry Pi itself. To access the Flask app from another device on the network, you need to make it accessible on the network interface.\n\nHere's how you can fix this:\n\n1. **Update your Flask application to run on the network interface:**\n\n   When you start your Flask app, you need to specify the host as `0.0.0.0`. This tells Flask to listen on all interfaces, making it accessible from other devices on the same network.\n\n   For example, update your `app.run()` method like this:\n\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       app.run(host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=5000)\n   ```\n\n2. **Find the Raspberry Pi's IP address:**\n\n   You need to find the local IP address of the Raspberry Pi on your network. You can do this by running the following command on your Raspberry Pi:\n\n   ```bash\n   hostname -I\n   ```\n\n   This will give you the IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.10`).\n\n3. **Access the Flask app from your laptop:**\n\n   Now that your Flask app is running on the network interface, you can access it from your laptop using the Raspberry Pi\u2019s IP address. Open a web browser on your laptop and go to:\n\n   ```\n   http://192.168.1.10:5000\n   ```\n\n   Replace `192.168.1.10` with the actual IP address of your Raspberry Pi.\n\n4. **Ensure network connectivity:**\n\n   Make sure that both your laptop and Raspberry Pi are connected to the same network. Check your firewall settings to ensure that your Raspberry Pi is not blocking incoming connections on port 5000.\n\n5. **Check firewall settings:**\n\n   If you have a firewall enabled on the Raspberry Pi, make sure it allows incoming connections on port 5000. You can adjust firewall settings using `ufw` or `iptables`, depending on what you're using.\n\nOnce you've done these steps, you should be able to access your Flask web service from your laptop without encountering the \"ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED\" error."
