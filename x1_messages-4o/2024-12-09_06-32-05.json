        "content": "To get the full path of the Python script you are currently running, you can use the `os.path` module along with the `__file__` attribute. This method works consistently across different operating systems. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Get the full path of the current script\nfull_path = os.path.abspath(__file__)\n\n# If you want the directory containing the script\ndirectory_path = os.path.dirname(full_path)\n\nprint(\"Full path of the script:\", full_path)\nprint(\"Directory path of the script:\", directory_path)\n```\n\n- `__file__`: This attribute gives you the path of the script being executed.\n- `os.path.abspath()`: Converts the given path to an absolute path.\n- `os.path.dirname()`: Extracts the directory part of the path, which can be useful if you want to work with files relative to the script's directory.\n\nUsing this approach ensures that you can open files relative to your script's location, regardless of where the script is executed from."
