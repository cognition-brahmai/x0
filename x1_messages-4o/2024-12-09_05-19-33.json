The code I am using currently doesn't provide the full traceback as I want it to. I am also interested in a case where I am using the `logging` module to log the exception and I need the traceback object to be passed to a third party module. Here is the code I am using:\n\nCase 1:\n```python\nimport traceback\n\ndef func():\n    try:\n        raise Exception('Dummy')\n    except:\n        traceback.print_exc()\n\ndef func2():\n    func()\n\nfunc2()\n```\n\nWhen I run this, I get:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"test.py\", line 5, in func\n    raise Exception('Dummy')\nException: Dummy\n```\n\nCase 2:\n```python\nimport logging\n\ndef func():\n    try:\n        raise Exception('Dummy')\n    except:\n        logging.exception(\"Something awful happened!\")\n\ndef func2():\n    func()\n\nfunc2()\n```\n\nIn this case I am getting:\n```\nERROR:root:Something awful happened!\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"test.py\", line 9, in func\n    raise Exception('Dummy')\nException: Dummy\n```"

        "content": "To get a full traceback in Python, including the calls from functions like `func2` and `func`, you need to ensure that you are capturing and logging the traceback at the point where the exception is caught. The reason you're not seeing the full traceback is that the exception handling is occurring within the `func` function, which does not include the call to `func2`.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to get the full traceback for both cases:\n\n### Case 1: Using `traceback` Module\n\nTo capture the full traceback, including the call to `func2`, you should allow the exception to propagate up to the point where you want to handle it:\n\n```python\nimport traceback\n\ndef func():\n    raise Exception('Dummy')\n\ndef func2():\n    func()\n\ntry:\n    func2()\nexcept Exception as e:\n    traceback.print_exc()\n```\n\n### Case 2: Using `logging` Module\n\nSimilarly, for logging, you want to handle the exception at the level where you want the full traceback:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\n# Configure logging to display messages to the console\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR)\n\ndef func():\n    raise Exception('Dummy')\n\ndef func2():\n    func()\n\ntry:\n    func2()\nexcept Exception as e:\n    logging.exception(\"Something awful happened!\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nIn both cases, by allowing the exception to propagate to the top-level `try`-`except` block, you ensure that the traceback includes all the function calls leading up to the exception. This captures the flow from `func2` to `func`, providing a complete picture of the call stack when the exception occurred.\n\n### Passing the Traceback to a Third-Party Module\n\nIf you need to pass the traceback to a third-party module, you can capture the exception information using `sys.exc_info()` and extract the traceback object:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport traceback\n\ntry:\n    func2()\nexcept Exception:\n    exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback = sys.exc_info()\n    # Use the exc_traceback with your third-party module\n    # For example, let's assume the module has a function `process_traceback`\n    # third_party_module.process_traceback(exc_traceback)\n    traceback.print_exception(exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback)\n```\n\nThis gives you the flexibility to use the traceback in any way required by the third-party module."
