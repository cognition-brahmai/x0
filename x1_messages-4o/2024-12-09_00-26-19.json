        "content": "How can I inject a variable into the scope with a decorator in Python? I'm trying to define a variable within a decorator where it's called and use it in another function without leaking it outside the decorator's scope. Here is the code I'm working with:\n\n```python\nc = 'Message'\n\ndef decorator_factory(value):\n    def msg_decorator(f):\n        def inner_dec(*args, **kwargs):\n            var = value\n            res = f(*args, **kwargs)\n            return res\n        return inner_dec\n    return msg_decorator\n\n@decorator_factory(c)\ndef msg_printer():\n    print var\n\nmsg_printer()\n```\nHowever, when I run it, I get a NameError saying 'global name 'var' is not defined'. The traceback even points to where 'var' is defined:\n\n```python\n<ipython-input-25-34b84bee70dc> in inner_dec(*args, **kwargs)\n  8         def inner_dec(*args, **kwargs):\n  9             var = value\n---> 10             res = f(*args, **kwargs)\n 11             return res\n 12         return inner_dec\n```\nIs there a way to solve this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the scope of the variable `var` within the decorator. In Python, each function has its own local scope, so the `var` defined inside the `inner_dec` function is not accessible in the `msg_printer` function.\n\nTo achieve what you want, you can pass the variable as an argument to the function being decorated. This way, the decorated function can access the variable. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nc = 'Message'\n\ndef decorator_factory(value):\n    def msg_decorator(f):\n        def inner_dec(*args, **kwargs):\n            # Pass the variable 'var' to the function f\n            return f(value, *args, **kwargs)\n        return inner_dec\n    return msg_decorator\n\n@decorator_factory(c)\ndef msg_printer(var):\n    print(var)\n\nmsg_printer()\n```\n\nIn this modified version, `inner_dec` calls `f` (which is `msg_printer`) with the `value` as the first argument. The `msg_printer` function now accepts a parameter `var`, which is then printed. This approach keeps the variable `var` within the scope of the `msg_printer` function and avoids leaking it outside the decorator's scope."
