I am trying to create a new column `variance` which is the sum of `budget` and `actual` columns. However, when I use the syntax `sum = data['variance'] = data.budget + data.actual`, it creates a series rather than adding a new column to my dataframe. How can I correctly create a `variance` column?"

        "content": "To create a new column named `variance` in your dataframe `data`, which represents the sum of the `budget` and `actual` columns, you should directly assign the result of the addition to the new column. Your current approach seems almost correct, but it looks like you're assigning it to a variable `sum`, which is unnecessary if you're just adding a column. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming you already have a DataFrame `data` with columns `budget` and `actual`\ndata['variance'] = data['budget'] + data['actual']\n```\n\nThis line of code will add a new column `variance` to your dataframe `data`, containing the sum of the values from the `budget` and `actual` columns for each row.\n\nIf you want to verify that the new column has been added correctly, you can print the first few rows of your dataframe:\n\n```python\nprint(data.head())\n```\n\nThis should now show the `variance` column with the desired values."
