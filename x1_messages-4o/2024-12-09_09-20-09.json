        "content": "Certainly! Below is a C++ program that prints all the prime numbers from 1 to a given number `n`. This program uses a simple method to check for prime numbers by verifying that they are not divisible by any number other than 1 and themselves.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\n// Function to check if a number is prime\nbool isPrime(int num) {\n    if (num <= 1) return false; // 0 and 1 are not prime numbers\n    if (num == 2) return true;  // 2 is the only even prime number\n    if (num % 2 == 0) return false; // All other even numbers are not prime\n\n    // Check for factors from 3 to sqrt(num)\n    for (int i = 3; i * i <= num; i += 2) {\n        if (num % i == 0) return false;\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    cout << \"Enter a number: \";\n    cin >> n;\n\n    cout << \"Prime numbers from 1 to \" << n << \" are: \";\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {\n        if (isPrime(i)) {\n            cout << i << \" \";\n        }\n    }\n    cout << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The program includes a function `isPrime(int num)` that checks if a number is prime.\n- The main function prompts the user to enter a number `n`.\n- It then iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n` and prints those that are prime, using the `isPrime` function to check each number.\n- The `isPrime` function first handles edge cases (numbers less than or equal to 1 and even numbers greater than 2). It then checks for divisibility using a loop up to the square root of the number, improving efficiency.\n\nYou can compile and run this program using any standard C++ compiler."
