        "content": "I am trying to implement a weighted binary cross-entropy with Keras, but I am having some issues. The training output seems to be a bit confusing as after a few epochs I just get an accuracy of approximately 0.15, which is much lower than I expected, even for a random guess. In my data, there are about 11% ones and 89% zeros, so I set the weights as w_zero=0.89 and w_one=0.11. However, the output is not as expected. Could someone help me identify what's wrong with my code?\n\nHere's the code I have written:\n\n```python\ndef create_weighted_binary_crossentropy(zero_weight, one_weight):\n\n    def weighted_binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred):\n\n        # Original binary crossentropy (see losses.py):\n        # K.mean(K.binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred), axis=-1)\n\n        # Calculate the binary crossentropy\n        b_ce = K.binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred)\n\n        # Apply the weights\n        weight_vector = y_true * one_weight + (1. - y_true) * zero_weight\n        weighted_b_ce = weight_vector * b_ce\n\n        # Return the mean error\n        return K.mean(weighted_b_ce)\n\n    return weighted_binary_crossentropy\n```"

        "content": "Your approach to creating a weighted binary cross-entropy loss function seems mostly correct, but there are a few things you may want to check and adjust to ensure that it's implemented correctly and works as expected with your model. Here are some suggestions and potential issues to consider:\n\n1. **Weight Calculation**: It seems you may have misunderstood how to set the weights. In weighted binary cross-entropy, the weights are usually set inversely proportional to the class frequencies to counteract the class imbalance. So, if you have 11% ones and 89% zeros, you might want to consider setting `w_one` to be higher than `w_zero`, not lower. For example:\n   - `w_one = 1.0` (or higher, depending on the importance of the minority class)\n   - `w_zero = 0.89 / 0.11 = 8.09` (or adjust accordingly)\n\n2. **Loss Function Usage**: Ensure that you are using this custom loss function correctly in your model compilation:\n   ```python\n   model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=create_weighted_binary_crossentropy(w_zero, w_one), metrics=['accuracy'])\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify Predictions**: Check your model predictions to ensure they are within a reasonable range before applying the loss function. If your network's output layer is not set up correctly with a sigmoid activation, the predictions might not be valid probabilities.\n\n4. **Learning Rate**: Consider adjusting the learning rate of your optimizer. Sometimes, a learning rate that's too high or too low can lead to poor model performance.\n\n5. **Model Architecture**: Ensure that your model architecture is appropriate for the task. If your model is too simple or not well-tuned, it might not learn effectively regardless of the loss function.\n\n6. **Data Preprocessing**: Double-check your data preprocessing steps. Ensure that your data is correctly normalized and that there are no errors in how the data is fed into the model.\n\n7. **Monitor Loss**: Besides accuracy, monitor the loss value during training. A decreasing loss indicates the model is learning, whereas a constant or increasing loss may point to issues with the learning process.\n\nAfter checking and adjusting these aspects, run a few training experiments. If issues persist, consider experimenting with different weight values or other techniques for handling class imbalance, such as data augmentation or using class weights directly in Keras's `fit` method."
