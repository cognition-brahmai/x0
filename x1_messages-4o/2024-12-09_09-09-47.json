        "content": "To find all pairs of numbers in an array that sum up to a specific value, you can use a simple algorithm that involves iterating through the array and using a hash map (or dictionary) to keep track of the numbers you've seen so far. This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. Here's a Python program to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef find_pairs_with_sum(arr, target_sum):\n    # Create a dictionary to store numbers and their counts\n    seen = {}\n    # List to store pairs\n    pairs = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the array\n    for number in arr:\n        # Calculate the complement\n        complement = target_sum - number\n        \n        # Check if the complement is already in the seen dictionary\n        if complement in seen:\n            # If it is, then we have found a pair\n            for _ in range(seen[complement]):\n                pairs.append((complement, number))\n        \n        # Add the current number to the seen dictionary, or increment its count\n        if number in seen:\n            seen[number] += 1\n        else:\n            seen[number] = 1\n    \n    return pairs\n\n# Example usage\narray = [1, 5, 7, -1, 5]\nspecific_sum = 6\npairs = find_pairs_with_sum(array, specific_sum)\nprint(\"Pairs with sum\", specific_sum, \"are:\", pairs)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Dictionary `seen`:** This dictionary is used to keep track of numbers we have encountered so far. If a number already exists in the dictionary, its count is incremented.\n\n2. **Iterate through the Array:** For each number in the array, calculate the complement required to reach the `target_sum`. \n\n3. **Check for Complement:** Check if this complement exists in the dictionary. If it does, it means that we have encountered a pair that adds up to the target sum.\n\n4. **Store Pairs:** If a complement is found, add the pair(s) to the list of pairs, considering how many times the complement has appeared before.\n\n5. **Result:** The function returns a list of all pairs that sum up to the `target_sum`.\n\nThis approach is efficient and works well for finding all pairs of numbers in the array that sum up to a given value."
