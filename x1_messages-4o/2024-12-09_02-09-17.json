I have a dictionary storing my Y-axis values and I'm creating corresponding X-axis values with the following code: \n\n```python\nfor i in range(len(ID)):\n    AxisY= PlotPoints[ID[i]]\n    if len(AxisY)> 5:\n        AxisX= [len(AxisY)]\n        for i in range(1,len(AxisY)):\n            AxisX.append(AxisX[i-1]-1)\n        plt.plot(AxisX,AxisY)\n        plt.xlabel('Lead Time (in days)')\n        plt.ylabel('Proportation of Events Scheduled')\n        ax = plt.gca()\n        ax.invert_xaxis()\n        ax.yaxis.tick_right()\n        ax.yaxis.set_label_position(\"right\")\n        plt.show()\n```\n\nHowever, instead of getting a single figure with multiple plots, I'm getting separate figures with a single plot each. Can anyone help me understand what's wrong with my code and why I can't produce a multiple-line plot?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the placement of the `plt.show()` function within your loop. The `plt.show()` function is responsible for displaying the plot, and because it is inside the loop, it generates a new figure for each iteration. To display all the lines on a single figure, you should move `plt.show()` outside the loop. Here's the corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Your dictionary PlotPoints and list ID should be defined here\n\nfor i in range(len(ID)):\n    AxisY = PlotPoints[ID[i]]\n    if len(AxisY) > 5:\n        AxisX = [len(AxisY)]\n        for j in range(1, len(AxisY)):\n            AxisX.append(AxisX[j-1] - 1)\n        plt.plot(AxisX, AxisY)\n\n# Set labels and axis properties after the loop\nplt.xlabel('Lead Time (in days)')\nplt.ylabel('Proportion of Events Scheduled')\nax = plt.gca()\nax.invert_xaxis()\nax.yaxis.tick_right()\nax.yaxis.set_label_position(\"right\")\n\n# Display the plot with all lines\nplt.show()\n```\n\nWith these changes, `plt.plot(AxisX, AxisY)` will be called multiple times within the loop to plot different lines, but `plt.show()` is called only once after the loop, displaying all lines on the same figure. \n\nAdditionally, I noticed a small issue with how you're creating `AxisX`. The list comprehension inside the loop should start with `0` to match the length of `AxisY`, so you might want to adjust the creation of `AxisX` like this:\n\n```python\nAxisX = list(range(len(AxisY), 0, -1))\n```\n\nThis will create a correctly formatted X-axis that starts from the length of `AxisY` and decrements to 1, matching the number of elements in `AxisY`."
