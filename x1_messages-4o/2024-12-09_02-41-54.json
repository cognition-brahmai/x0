The steps to follow are: compute the convex hull of the cloud of points, for each edge of the convex hull - compute the edge orientation, rotate the convex hull using this orientation in order to compute the bounding rectangle area with min/max of x/y of the rotated convex hull, store the orientation corresponding to the minimum area found, and finally return the rectangle corresponding to the minimum area found. After that, I need to calculate the angle Theta (which represents the orientation of the bounding rectangle relative to the y-axis of the image). The minimum and maximum of a and b over all boundary points are found using the equations a(xi,yi) = xi*cos Theta + yi sin Theta and b(xi,yi) = xi*sin Theta + yi cos Theta. The values (a_max - a_min) and (b_max - b_min) define the length and width, respectively, of the bounding rectangle for a direction Theta.

        "content": "To calculate the major and minor axis lengths of the minimum area rectangle for your given set of points, you can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Compute the Convex Hull\nFirst, compute the convex hull of the given set of points. The convex hull is the smallest polygon that encloses all the points. You can use libraries like SciPy or Shapely in Python to get the convex hull.\n\n### Step 2: Iterate Over each Edge of the Convex Hull\nFor each edge of the convex hull, you will:\n\n1. **Compute Edge Orientation**: Calculate the angle of the edge with respect to the horizontal axis. This can be done using the arctangent of the slope of the edge.\n\n2. **Rotate the Convex Hull**: Rotate the entire convex hull so that the edge is aligned with one of the coordinate axes. This simplifies the calculation of the bounding rectangle.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Bounding Rectangle\nFor the rotated convex hull, compute the bounding rectangle by finding the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates. Calculate the area of this rectangle.\n\n### Step 4: Find the Minimum Area\nTrack the orientation and dimensions of the bounding rectangle that gives the minimum area. This will be your minimum area enclosing rectangle.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Angle Theta\nThe angle \\(\\Theta\\) is the orientation of this minimum area rectangle with respect to the original coordinate system (y-axis).\n\n### Step 6: Calculate a and b\nFor each point on the boundary of the convex hull:\n\n- Calculate \\(a(x_i, y_i) = x_i \\cdot \\cos(\\Theta) + y_i \\cdot \\sin(\\Theta)\\)\n- Calculate \\(b(x_i, y_i) = x_i \\cdot \\sin(\\Theta) - y_i \\cdot \\cos(\\Theta)\\)\n\n### Step 7: Find \\(a_{\\text{max}}\\), \\(a_{\\text{min}}\\), \\(b_{\\text{max}}\\), \\(b_{\\text{min}}\\)\nThis involves iterating through all points to find the maximum and minimum values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n### Step 8: Calculate the Lengths of the Major and Minor Axes\nThe lengths of the major and minor axes of the rectangle are given by:\n\n- Major axis length = \\(a_{\\text{max}} - a_{\\text{min}}\\)\n- Minor axis length = \\(b_{\\text{max}} - b_{\\text{min}}\\)\n\n### Implementation\n\nHere is a Python implementation using the `scipy` and `numpy` libraries:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.spatial import ConvexHull\n\npoints = np.array([\n    (560023.44957588764, 6362057.3904932579),\n    (560023.44957588764, 6362060.3904932579),\n    (560024.44957588764, 6362063.3904932579),\n    (560026.94957588764, 6362068.3904932579),\n    (560028.44957588764, 6362069.8904932579),\n    (560034.94957588764, 6362071.8904932579),\n    (560036.44957588764, 6362071.8904932579),\n    (560037.44957588764, 6362070.3904932579),\n    (560037.44957588764, 6362064.8904932579),\n    (560036.44957588764, 6362063.3904932579),\n    (560034.94957588764, 6362061.3904932579),\n    (560026.94957588764, 6362057.8904932579),\n    (560025.44957588764, 6362057.3904932579),\n    (560023.44957588764, 6362057.3904932579)\n])\n\nhull = ConvexHull(points)\nhull_points = points[hull.vertices]\n\ndef min_area_rectangle(points):\n    min_area = float('inf')\n    best_rect = None\n    best_theta = 0\n\n    for i in range(len(points)):\n        p1 = points[i]\n        p2 = points[(i + 1) % len(points)]\n        edge = p2 - p1\n        theta = np.arctan2(edge[1], edge[0])\n        rotation_matrix = np.array([\n            [np.cos(theta), np.sin(theta)],\n            [-np.sin(theta), np.cos(theta)]\n        ])\n\n        rotated_points = np.dot(points, rotation_matrix)\n        min_x, min_y = np.min(rotated_points, axis=0)\n        max_x, max_y = np.max(rotated_points, axis=0)\n\n        area = (max_x - min_x) * (max_y - min_y)\n        if area < min_area:\n            min_area = area\n            best_rect = ((min_x, min_y), (max_x, max_y))\n            best_theta = theta\n\n    return best_rect, best_theta\n\nrectangle, theta = min_area_rectangle(hull_points)\nx_min, y_min = rectangle[0]\nx_max, y_max = rectangle[1]\nmajor_axis_length = x_max - x_min\nminor_axis_length = y_max - y_min\n\nprint(f\"Major axis length: {major_axis_length}\")\nprint(f\"Minor axis length: {minor_axis_length}\")\nprint(f\"Theta (orientation): {np.degrees(theta)} degrees\")\n```\n\nThis script will help you find the minimum area bounding rectangle for the given set of points and calculate the lengths of its major and minor axes along with the orientation angle \\(\\Theta\\)."
