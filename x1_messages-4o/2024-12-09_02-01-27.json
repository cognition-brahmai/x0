        "content": "To find local IP addresses in a platform-independent manner using Python's standard library, you can use the `socket` module. The `socket` module provides a way to interact with the network interfaces and can be used to find the local IP address of a machine. Here's an approach to achieve that:\n\n```python\nimport socket\n\ndef get_local_ip():\n    # Connect to an external host to determine the interface used\n    try:\n        # Use Google's DNS server as an external address\n        with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM) as s:\n            # Connect to an external host to determine the interface used\n            s.connect(('8.8.8.8', 80))\n            local_ip = s.getsockname()[0]\n    except Exception as e:\n        return f\"Error obtaining local IP: {e}\"\n\n    return local_ip\n\nlocal_ip = get_local_ip()\nprint(f\"Local IP Address: {local_ip}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Create a Socket**: The code uses `socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)` to create a socket. Here, `AF_INET` indicates that we are using IPv4, and `SOCK_DGRAM` indicates that we are using UDP.\n\n2. **Connect to an External Host**: The socket connects to an external host (in this case, Google's public DNS server at `8.8.8.8` on port `80`). This step doesn't actually send any data but is used to determine which network interface the operating system would use to reach the external host.\n\n3. **Get Local IP Address**: The `getsockname()` method is called on the socket object to retrieve the local endpoint's address used for the connection. The `[0]` index accesses the IP address portion of the endpoint.\n\n4. **Handle Exceptions**: The connection attempt might fail if there is no network available, so it's wrapped in a try-except block to catch and handle exceptions.\n\nThis approach is platform-independent and should work on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Keep in mind that this will give you the primary IP address used to reach external networks, typically the local IP on the main network interface used for internet access."
