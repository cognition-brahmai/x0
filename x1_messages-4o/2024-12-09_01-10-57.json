        "content": "The `NoReverseMatch` error you're encountering is typically due to a missing or misconfigured URL pattern in your Django application. In your case, it seems like the password reset URL for confirming the reset is not correctly set up. The `rest-auth` package depends on Django's built-in password reset views, so we need to ensure that those URLs are available.\n\nHere's how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Django's Auth URLs are included**: Make sure you're including Django's built-in authentication URLs, which include the URLs needed for password reset. You can do this by adding them to your `urls.py`.\n\n2. **Update `urls.py`**: Modify your `urls.py` to include Django's authentication URLs. Here's an example of how you can do that:\n\n    ```python\n    from django.conf.urls import include, url\n    from django.contrib import admin\n    from django.urls import path\n\n    urlpatterns = [\n        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),\n        path('rest-auth/', include('rest_auth.urls')),\n        path('rest-auth/registration/', include('rest_auth.registration.urls')),\n        path('account/', include('allauth.urls')),\n        path('auth/', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')),  # Add this line\n    ]\n    ```\n\n3. **Check your `settings.py`**: Make sure that you have the necessary settings for email configuration if you're using email-based password reset. This includes settings like `EMAIL_BACKEND`, `EMAIL_HOST`, etc.\n\n4. **Double-check URL patterns**: Ensure that the pattern you're trying to reverse is correctly registered. The error message indicates that it's looking for a pattern with `uidb64` and `token`. Verify that your URLs include the necessary patterns, and that `rest-auth` is correctly set up to handle password resets.\n\n5. **Verify Template and View Configuration**: Ensure that the password reset confirm view is correctly configured to use the `uidb64` and `token` as URL parameters. You may need to override some of the default templates or views provided by `django-allauth` or `rest-auth` to match your needs.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `NoReverseMatch` error. If the issue persists, double-check your URL patterns and the configurations related to password reset in your application."
