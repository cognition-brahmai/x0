        "content": "Certainly! To check if a specific character is present in a given input string, you can use a simple approach in most programming languages. Here are examples in a few popular languages:\n\n### Python\n```python\ndef contains_character(input_string, character):\n    return character in input_string\n\n# Example usage\ninput_string = \"Hello, World!\"\ncharacter = \"W\"\nif contains_character(input_string, character):\n    print(f\"The character '{character}' is present in the string.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"The character '{character}' is not present in the string.\")\n```\n\n### JavaScript\n```javascript\nfunction containsCharacter(inputString, character) {\n    return inputString.includes(character);\n}\n\n// Example usage\nconst inputString = \"Hello, World!\";\nconst character = \"W\";\nif (containsCharacter(inputString, character)) {\n    console.log(`The character '${character}' is present in the string.`);\n} else {\n    console.log(`The character '${character}' is not present in the string.`);\n}\n```\n\n### Java\n```java\npublic class CharacterCheck {\n    public static boolean containsCharacter(String inputString, char character) {\n        return inputString.indexOf(character) != -1;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String inputString = \"Hello, World!\";\n        char character = 'W';\n        if (containsCharacter(inputString, character)) {\n            System.out.println(\"The character '\" + character + \"' is present in the string.\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"The character '\" + character + \"' is not present in the string.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### C++\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n\nbool containsCharacter(const std::string& inputString, char character) {\n    return inputString.find(character) != std::string::npos;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::string inputString = \"Hello, World!\";\n    char character = 'W';\n    if (containsCharacter(inputString, character)) {\n        std::cout << \"The character '\" << character << \"' is present in the string.\" << std::endl;\n    } else {\n        std::cout << \"The character '\" << character << \"' is not present in the string.\" << std::endl;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThese snippets should help you check for the presence of a specific character in a string across different programming languages.
