        "content": "For inter-process communication (IPC) between a C++ process and a Python process, especially when aiming for a lightweight C++ implementation and read-only Python side, you have several cross-platform options to consider:\n\n1. **Sockets**: Using network sockets is a common method for IPC. You can use TCP or UDP sockets to send events from the C++ process to the Python process. This method is cross-platform and fairly lightweight. Python\u2019s `socket` library and C++'s `<sys/socket.h>` (or a similar library) can handle this communication.\n\n2. **Named Pipes (FIFOs)**: Named pipes are another cross-platform IPC method. They allow for unidirectional communication, which fits your use case. You can create a named pipe in C++ and read from it in Python using the `os` module.\n\n3. **Shared Memory**: This method involves mapping a memory segment that both processes can access. Libraries like Boost.Interprocess in C++ and `multiprocessing.shared_memory` in Python can be used. Shared memory is efficient but requires careful synchronization to avoid race conditions.\n\n4. **Message Queues**: Cross-platform message queue libraries like ZeroMQ provide a lightweight and efficient mechanism for message passing between processes. ZeroMQ has bindings for both C++ and Python, allowing you to easily implement the communication.\n\n5. **Files**: Although not the most efficient method, writing events to a file from the C++ process and reading them in the Python process is simple and cross-platform. You can use file locks to manage concurrency.\n\n6. **Third-party Libraries**: Libraries such as gRPC or Protocol Buffers can be used to define a communication protocol between the processes. They handle serialization and transport, but may add some overhead compared to simpler methods.\n\nFor lightweight and straightforward implementation, sockets or named pipes are often preferred due to their simplicity and ease of use across different platforms."
