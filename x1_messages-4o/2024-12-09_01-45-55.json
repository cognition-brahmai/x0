However, if I leave the except: block empty or with a comment such as #do nothing, I get a syntax error. Since my code isn't in a loop, I can't use the continue keyword. Is there a specific keyword or method I can use that instructs the program to just keep going?"

The `pass` statement acts as a placeholder and does nothing when executed, allowing the program to continue running.\n\nHere is how you can structure your `try...except` block:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Code that might raise an exception\n    risky_operation()\nexcept SomeSpecificException:\n    # Do nothing and continue\n    pass\n\n# Rest of your code\ncontinue_running()\n```\n\nThe `pass` statement is a valid Python statement that effectively does nothing, serving as a way to write empty blocks of code. This way, your program will catch the exception, do nothing, and proceed with executing the subsequent code."
