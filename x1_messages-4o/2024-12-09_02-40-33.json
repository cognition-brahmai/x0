When I add a certain piece of code before the multiprocessing step, it seems to cause a RuntimeError: Unable to handle autograd's threading in combination with fork-based multiprocessing. This error occurs during the multiprocessing step. The error does not occur if I comment out the two lines of code `m0 = Model(); train(m0)` which execute a non-parallel training run on a separate model instance. I'm using PyTorch 1.5.1 and Python 3.7.6 on a Linux machine and performing training on CPU only. Can anyone help me figure out how these lines could be causing a problem?\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\nfrom torch import nn\n\ndef train(model):\n    opt = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-5)\n    for _ in range(10000):\n        opt.zero_grad()\n        # We train the model to output the value 4 (arbitrarily)\n        loss = (model(0) - 4)**2\n        loss.backward()\n        opt.step()\n\n# Toy model with one parameter tensor of size 3.\n# Output is always the sum of the elements in the tensor,\n# independent of the input\nclass Model(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.x = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(3))\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        return torch.sum(self.x)\n\n############################################\n# Create a separate Model instance and run\n# a non-parallel training run.\n# For some reason, this code causes the \n# subsequent parallel run to fail.\nm0 = Model()\ntrain(m0)\nprint ('Done with preliminary run')\n############################################\n\nnum_processes = 2\nmodel = Model()\nmodel.share_memory()\nprocesses = []\nfor rank in range(num_processes):\n    p = mp.Process(target=train, args=(model,))\n    p.start()\n    processes.append(p)\nfor p in processes:\n    p.join()\n    \nprint(model.x)\n```"

        "content": "The issue you are encountering with the RuntimeError related to autograd's threading in combination with fork-based multiprocessing is likely related to how PyTorch handles multiprocessing and threading, especially when using the `fork` start method, which is the default on Unix systems.\n\nWhen you create a model and perform operations on it outside of a multiprocessing context, like in your preliminary non-parallel training run, it can cause issues when you later attempt to share this model across processes. This is because the autograd engine may spawn threads that are incompatible with the `fork` method of creating new processes.\n\nHere are a few potential solutions to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Use the 'spawn' or 'forkserver' Start Method**: The `spawn` or `forkserver` method is more robust as it initializes a fresh Python interpreter process. You can set this by changing the start method at the beginning of your script:\n\n    ```python\n    import torch.multiprocessing as mp\n\n    if __name__ == '__main__':\n        mp.set_start_method('spawn')\n    ```\n\n    Make sure to include the `if __name__ == '__main__':` guard to prevent issues on Windows and with certain Python configurations.\n\n2. **Avoid Executing Autograd Code Before Multiprocessing**:\n   Since the preliminary run seems to interfere with the multiprocessing run, consider structuring your code so that any training or autograd operations are only performed within the processes themselves.\n\n3. **Isolate the Preliminary Training**:\n   If you need to perform some preliminary training, you could handle it within a separate script or within a function guarded by `if __name__ == '__main__':`, so that the multiprocessing context is clean when it starts.\n\nHere's how you might structure your code with the `spawn` method:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\nfrom torch import nn\n\ndef train(model):\n    opt = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-5)\n    for _ in range(10000):\n        opt.zero_grad()\n        loss = (model(0) - 4)**2\n        loss.backward()\n        opt.step()\n\nclass Model(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.x = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(3))\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        return torch.sum(self.x)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    mp.set_start_method('spawn')\n    \n    # Preliminary training (optional, if necessary)\n    m0 = Model()\n    train(m0)\n    print('Done with preliminary run')\n\n    num_processes = 2\n    model = Model()\n    model.share_memory()\n\n    processes = []\n    for rank in range(num_processes):\n        p = mp.Process(target=train, args=(model,))\n        p.start()\n        processes.append(p)\n    for p in processes:\n        p.join()\n    \n    print(model.x)\n```\n\nThis setup should help avoid the threading issues you're running into with the fork start method."
