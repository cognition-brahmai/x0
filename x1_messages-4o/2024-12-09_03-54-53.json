I saw the official documentation which introduces different initializers like this:\n\n```python\nmodel.add(Dense(64, kernel_initializer='random_normal'))\n```\n\nHowever, I was not able to find information about the default weight initializer in Keras when the `kernel_initializer` argument is not specified. How can I find out what the default weight initializer is and is there a way to access it?"

        "content": "In Keras, if you do not specify a `kernel_initializer` when adding a layer, the default initializer is used. As of the latest update, the default initializer for the `Dense` layer in Keras is the \"Glorot Uniform\" initializer, also known as Xavier uniform initializer. This initializer is designed to keep the scale of the gradients roughly the same in all layers.\n\nTo check or verify the default initializer, you can always refer to the official Keras documentation or examine the source code of the specific version of Keras you are using. Additionally, you can programmatically access the default initializer by creating a layer without specifying an initializer and then inspecting the layer's configuration. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense\n\n# Create a model and add a Dense layer without specifying the initializer\nmodel = Sequential()\nlayer = Dense(64)  # No kernel_initializer specified\nmodel.add(layer)\n\n# Access and print the default kernel_initializer of the layer\nprint(layer.kernel_initializer)\n```\n\nThis code snippet will show you the default initializer used by the layer, which should be `glorot_uniform` if you are using a recent version of Keras."
