For instance, I want to generate dates every 4 days between 2011-10-10 and 2011-12-12 or every 8 hours between now and tomorrow 19 p.m. Is there a Python equivalent to the Dateperiod PHP class?"

        "content": "To generate a list of datetimes between two given datetimes with a specified interval, you can use Python's `datetime` module along with `timedelta` for interval handling. Here's how you can do it for both days and hours:\n\n1. **For intervals in days** (e.g., every 4 days):\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\ndef generate_dates_days(start_date, end_date, interval_days):\n    current_date = start_date\n    while current_date <= end_date:\n        yield current_date\n        current_date += timedelta(days=interval_days)\n\n# Example usage\nstart_date = datetime(2011, 10, 10)\nend_date = datetime(2011, 12, 12)\ninterval_days = 4\n\ndates = list(generate_dates_days(start_date, end_date, interval_days))\nfor date in dates:\n    print(date)\n```\n\n2. **For intervals in hours** (e.g., every 8 hours):\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\ndef generate_dates_hours(start_date, end_date, interval_hours):\n    current_date = start_date\n    while current_date <= end_date:\n        yield current_date\n        current_date += timedelta(hours=interval_hours)\n\n# Example usage\nstart_date = datetime.now()\nend_date = datetime.now().replace(hour=19, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0) + timedelta(days=1)\ninterval_hours = 8\n\ndates = list(generate_dates_hours(start_date, end_date, interval_hours))\nfor date in dates:\n    print(date)\n```\n\nIn these examples, the functions `generate_dates_days` and `generate_dates_hours` are generators that yield datetime objects in the specified intervals. You can adjust the `interval_days` and `interval_hours` variables as needed to change the frequency of the generated dates.\n\nThis method is flexible and can be adapted to other time intervals by modifying the `timedelta` parameters accordingly."
