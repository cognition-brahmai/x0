Additionally, please offer a detailed solution to calculate the total price of a restaurant order based on the given JSON data, which contains information on individual prices and variations in toppings and sizes. Remember to maintain the example JSON data, which includes two items with unique toppings, sizes, and quantities, and provide a solution that can easily handle such complexities."

        "content": "Certainly! To tackle this problem, we need to design an adaptable algorithm that can process the JSON data structure representing a restaurant order, taking into consideration the variations in toppings, sizes, and quantities. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n### Step 1: Define the JSON Structure\n\nLet's define a sample JSON structure for a restaurant order that includes items like pizza and soda, each with different size and topping options.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"order\": [\n    {\n      \"item\": \"Pizza\",\n      \"base_price\": 8.00,\n      \"size\": \"Medium\",\n      \"size_price_variation\": {\n        \"Small\": -2.00,\n        \"Medium\": 0.00,\n        \"Large\": 3.00\n      },\n      \"toppings\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"Pepperoni\",\n          \"price\": 1.50\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"Mushrooms\",\n          \"price\": 1.00\n        }\n      ],\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"item\": \"Soda\",\n      \"base_price\": 1.50,\n      \"size\": \"Large\",\n      \"size_price_variation\": {\n        \"Small\": -0.50,\n        \"Medium\": 0.00,\n        \"Large\": 0.50\n      },\n      \"toppings\": [],\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Algorithm to Calculate Total Price\n\nWe'll create a function to compute the total price of the order, considering size variations, toppings, and quantities.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_total_price(order_data):\n    total_price = 0.0\n\n    for item in order_data['order']:\n        # Base price for the item\n        base_price = item['base_price']\n        \n        # Calculate size price variation\n        size_price = item['size_price_variation'].get(item['size'], 0.00)\n        \n        # Calculate total toppings price\n        toppings_price = sum(topping['price'] for topping in item['toppings'])\n        \n        # Calculate item total price (base + size variation + toppings) multiplied by quantity\n        item_total_price = (base_price + size_price + toppings_price) * item['quantity']\n        \n        # Add to total order price\n        total_price += item_total_price\n\n    return total_price\n\n# Example usage\norder_data = {\n    \"order\": [\n        {\n            \"item\": \"Pizza\",\n            \"base_price\": 8.00,\n            \"size\": \"Medium\",\n            \"size_price_variation\": {\n                \"Small\": -2.00,\n                \"Medium\": 0.00,\n                \"Large\": 3.00\n            },\n            \"toppings\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"Pepperoni\",\n                    \"price\": 1.50\n                },\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"Mushrooms\",\n                    \"price\": 1.00\n                }\n            ],\n            \"quantity\": 2\n        },\n        {\n            \"item\": \"Soda\",\n            \"base_price\": 1.50,\n            \"size\": \"Large\",\n            \"size_price_variation\": {\n                \"Small\": -0.50,\n                \"Medium\": 0.00,\n                \"Large\": 0.50\n            },\n            \"toppings\": [],\n            \"quantity\": 3\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\ntotal = calculate_total_price(order_data)\nprint(\"Total Order Price: $\", total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Base Price**: Each item starts with a base price.\n2. **Size Variation**: Adjust the price based on the selected size using the `size_price_variation` dictionary.\n3. **Toppings**: Sum the prices of all selected toppings.\n4. **Quantity**: Multiply the calculated price by the quantity ordered.\n5. **Total Calculation**: Accumulate the total price for all items in the order.\n\nThis algorithm is highly adaptable, allowing for easy addition of new items, sizes, and toppings as needed. Just ensure the JSON data format remains consistent to leverage the full capabilities of this solution."
