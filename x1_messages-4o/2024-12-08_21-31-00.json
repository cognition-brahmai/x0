Can you provide an example using the file 'mytextfile.txt' and searching for the word 'city' in it?\nHere is an example of how to achieve this in C#:\nstring file = @\"C:\\path\\to\\mytextfile.txt\";\nstring searchTerm = \"city\";\nstring[] lines = File.ReadAllLines(file);\nfor (int i = 0; i < lines.Length; i++)\n{\n    if (lines[i].Contains(searchTerm))\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Line \" + (i + 1) + \": \" + lines[i]);\n    }\n}"

        "content": "Certainly! Below is a C# example that demonstrates how to implement functionality similar to the 'grep' command. This program reads a text file, searches for a specified word, and prints each line containing that word along with the line number.\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.IO;\n\nclass GrepExample\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        string file = @\"C:\\path\\to\\mytextfile.txt\"; // specify your file path here\n        string searchTerm = \"city\"; // the word you want to search for\n\n        try\n        {\n            string[] lines = File.ReadAllLines(file);\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < lines.Length; i++)\n            {\n                if (lines[i].IndexOf(searchTerm, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) >= 0)\n                {\n                    Console.WriteLine(\"Line \" + (i + 1) + \": \" + lines[i]);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        catch (Exception e)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"An error occurred: \" + e.Message);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **File.ReadAllLines(file):** This reads all lines from the specified file and stores them in a string array.\n- **IndexOf with StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase:** This allows for a case-insensitive search for the search term within each line. It returns the zero-based index of the first occurrence of the search term, or -1 if it is not found.\n- **Try-Catch Block:** This is used to handle potential exceptions, such as file not found or access denied errors, gracefully.\n\n### Steps to Run:\n1. Ensure that the file path in the `file` variable is correct and that the file `mytextfile.txt` exists at that location.\n2. Compile and run the C# program.\n3. It will output the line numbers and content of lines containing the word \"city\".\n\nFeel free to modify the `file` and `searchTerm` variables to suit your needs!"
