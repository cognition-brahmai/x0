For example, when I use `os.readlink('/etc/fonts/conf.d/70-yes-bitmaps.conf')`, it outputs '../conf.avail/70-yes-bitmaps.conf'. However, I need the absolute path, not the relative path, so my desired output would be '/etc/fonts/conf.avail/70-yes-bitmaps.conf'. How can I replace the '..' with the actual full path of the parent directory of the symbolic link or soft link file?"

        "content": "To resolve a relative path from a symbolic link to its absolute path in Python, you can use the `os.path` module to combine the relative path with the directory of the link itself. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef resolve_symlink_to_absolute_path(symlink_path):\n    # Read the target of the symlink\n    target_path = os.readlink(symlink_path)\n    \n    # If the target is already an absolute path, return it\n    if os.path.isabs(target_path):\n        return target_path\n\n    # Otherwise, compute the absolute path\n    # Get the directory of the symlink\n    symlink_dir = os.path.dirname(symlink_path)\n    \n    # Join the directory of the symlink with the relative target path\n    absolute_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(symlink_dir, target_path))\n    \n    return absolute_path\n\n# Example usage\nsymlink_path = '/etc/fonts/conf.d/70-yes-bitmaps.conf'\nabsolute_path = resolve_symlink_to_absolute_path(symlink_path)\nprint(absolute_path)\n```\n\nThis function works by first checking if the target path from the symbolic link is already absolute. If it is not, it calculates the absolute path by joining the directory of the symlink with the relative path of the target, and then resolving it to an absolute path using `os.path.abspath`. This should give you the desired absolute path."
