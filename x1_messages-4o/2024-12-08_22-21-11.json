Please include the necessary variables and formula in your step-by-step guide.\nTo calculate the area of a circle in Python, you first need to import the math module using the following code:\nimport math\nThen, you need to define the radius of the circle as a variable. For example:\nradius = 5\nNext, you can calculate the area of the circle using the following formula:\narea = math.pi * (radius**2)\nFinally, you can print the result using the following code:\nprint(\"The area of the circle is:\", area)\nMake sure to replace the value of the radius variable with the actual radius of your circle."

        "content": "Certainly! Let's go through the process of calculating the area of a circle in Python step-by-step, using the formula \\( \\text{Area} = \\pi \\times \\text{radius}^2 \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide:\n\n1. **Import the Math Module:**\n   - The `math` module provides access to the mathematical constant \\(\\pi\\).\n\n   ```python\n   import math\n   ```\n\n2. **Define the Radius:**\n   - Assign the value of the radius of the circle to a variable. You can change this value to calculate the area for different circles.\n\n   ```python\n   radius = 5  # Replace 5 with the actual radius\n   ```\n\n3. **Calculate the Area:**\n   - Use the formula to calculate the area, which involves squaring the radius and multiplying by \\(\\pi\\).\n\n   ```python\n   area = math.pi * (radius ** 2)\n   ```\n\n4. **Print the Result:**\n   - Display the calculated area using the `print` function.\n\n   ```python\n   print(\"The area of the circle is:\", area)\n   ```\n\n### Complete Code:\n\nPutting it all together, here's the complete code snippet:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the radius of the circle\nradius = 5  # Replace with the actual radius\n\n# Calculate the area using the formula\narea = math.pi * (radius ** 2)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"The area of the circle is:\", area)\n```\n\n### Example Output:\n\nIf you run the above code with a radius of 5, you should get an output similar to:\n\n```\nThe area of the circle is: 78.53981633974483\n```\n\nThis output represents the area of a circle with a radius of 5 units. You can modify the `radius` variable to compute the area for circles of different sizes."
