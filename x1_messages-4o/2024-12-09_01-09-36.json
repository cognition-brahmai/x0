When I perform queries on large subsets of this table, I experience excessive memory consumption even though I thought I was using a built-in generator to fetch chunks of the dataset intelligently. My current code looks like this:\n```python\nfor thing in session.query(Things):\n    analyze(thing)\n```\nTo mitigate memory usage, I had to construct my own iterator that deals with chunks of data. My code for this is as follows:\n```python\nlastThingID = None\nwhile True:\n    things = query.filter(Thing.id < lastThingID).limit(querySize).all()\n    if not rows or len(rows) == 0: \n        break\n    for thing in things:\n        lastThingID = row.id\n        analyze(thing)\n```\nIs this a standard practice or am I overlooking something about SqlAlchemy's built-in generators? I found a related question that indicates unexpected memory consumption."

        "content": "Your approach to handling large datasets with SQLAlchemy is a common solution to manage memory consumption by processing data in chunks. However, let's address a few points and suggest some optimizations:\n\n1. **Built-in Generators and Streaming**: The default behavior of SQLAlchemy's `session.query` method is to load all results into memory, which can lead to high memory usage for large datasets. SQLAlchemy itself doesn't provide built-in chunking or streaming directly, but you can use Python's generators to process results incrementally.\n\n2. **Using `yield_per`**: SQLAlchemy does offer a method called `yield_per` which can help reduce memory usage by fetching results in batches. You can use it like this:\n\n   ```python\n   for thing in session.query(Things).yield_per(1000):  # Adjust the batch size as needed\n       analyze(thing)\n   ```\n\n   This instructs SQLAlchemy to fetch results in chunks of the specified size, allowing you to process large datasets without loading everything into memory at once.\n\n3. **Optimization of Your Iterator**: In your custom iterator, ensure that you're updating `lastThingID` correctly and using it in your query to fetch the next chunk. Your logic seems generally correct, but make sure that `lastThingID` is initialized properly before your loop starts. Also, it should be `thing.id` instead of `row.id`.\n\n4. **Database Indexes**: Ensure that there is an index on `Thing.id` to improve the performance of your queries when fetching data in chunks.\n\n5. **Pagination**: Consider using pagination techniques if applicable, where you fetch data page by page based on an offset or a cursor.\n\n6. **Other Strategies**: Depending on your database and requirements, you might also explore using server-side cursors, or leveraging a tool like `SQLAlchemy-Utils` for more advanced bulk operations.\n\nBy using `yield_per` and ensuring your iterator logic is sound, you should be able to efficiently process large datasets with reduced memory usage."
