        "content": "Is it possible to save a partly trained Keras model and continue the training after loading the model again? I am asking this because I will have more training data in the future and I do not want to retrain the whole model again. The functions which I am using are:\n\n```\n#Partly train model\nmodel.fit(first_training, first_classes, batch_size=32, nb_epoch=20)\n\n#Save partly trained model\nmodel.save('partly_trained.h5')\n\n#Load partly trained model\nfrom keras.models import load_model\nmodel = load_model('partly_trained.h5')\n\n#Continue training\nmodel.fit(second_training, second_classes, batch_size=32, nb_epoch=20)\n```\n\nWith the first dataset after 10 epochs the loss of the last epoch will be 0.0748 and the accuracy 0.9863. After saving, deleting and reloading the model the loss and accuracy of the model trained on the second dataset will be 0.1711 and 0.9504 respectively. Is this caused by the new training data or by a completely re-trained model?"

        "content": "When you save and load a Keras model using `model.save()` and `load_model()`, you are indeed preserving the model's architecture, weights, and optimizer state. This means that you should be able to continue training the model without losing the progress made during the initial training phase. \n\nThe discrepancy in loss and accuracy after reloading the model and continuing training can be attributed to a few factors, which are not related to the model being retrained from scratch:\n\n1. **New Training Data**: When you introduce new training data (i.e., `second_training` and `second_classes`), the model might initially perform worse on this dataset if it is significantly different from the first dataset. The model needs to adjust its weights to accommodate the new data, which can cause fluctuations in loss and accuracy.\n\n2. **Learning Rate and Optimizer State**: Although the optimizer's state is saved along with the model, if there are changes to the learning rate or other hyperparameters between the two training phases, it could affect the model's performance.\n\n3. **Overfitting or Underfitting**: If the second dataset is small or not representative of the overall distribution, the model might overfit or underfit, affecting its performance metrics.\n\n4. **Batch Size and Epochs**: Differences in batch size or the number of epochs can also lead to variations in the training process and subsequent model performance.\n\nTo ensure a smooth continuation of training, you might want to:\n\n- Check that the new dataset is preprocessed in the same way as the initial dataset.\n- Ensure that any data augmentation or other transformations are applied consistently.\n- Monitor the learning rate and other training parameters to make sure they are consistent unless intentionally changed.\n\nBy addressing these factors, you can better understand the reasons behind changes in loss and accuracy after continuing the training process with new data."
