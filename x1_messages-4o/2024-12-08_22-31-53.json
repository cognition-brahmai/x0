        "content": "To add a constraint to your Python code that ensures the transition sentence is phrased as desired, you can make use of comments or docstrings to specify the requirements clearly. Here\u2019s an approach you can take:\n\n1. **Define the requirements**: Clearly state what you want the transition sentence to achieve.\n2. **Use comments or docstrings**: Document these constraints within your code to make sure anyone reading or modifying the code understands the requirement.\n3. **Implement logic if needed**: If your code generates text, you might need to include logic to enforce these constraints.\n\nHere is an example of how you might structure this in your code:\n\n```python\ndef generate_transition_sentence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a transition sentence emphasizing the significant role of evolution\n    in the advancement of human civilization, followed by a sentence that highlights\n    the immense benefits it has brought to society and our surroundings.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Constraint: The transition sentence must highlight the crucial role of evolution.\n    # Example: \"The evolution of human language has been pivotal in shaping the trajectory of human civilization.\"\n    transition_sentence = \"The evolution of human language has been pivotal in shaping the trajectory of human civilization.\"\n\n    # Follow-up sentence emphasizing benefits.\n    # Example: \"It has enriched our communication, fostered innovation, and strengthened societal bonds.\"\n    additional_sentence = \"It has enriched our communication, fostered innovation, and strengthened societal bonds.\"\n\n    return transition_sentence + \" \" + additional_sentence\n\n# Example usage\nprint(generate_transition_sentence())\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that the intent is clear and the sentences are constructed to meet the specified requirements. If your application involves dynamic text generation, you might need to integrate natural language processing techniques to enforce such constraints programmatically."
