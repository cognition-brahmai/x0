I have a Docker image with a Python script as the entry-point and I would like to pass arguments to this Python script when the Docker container is run. I've tried to retrieve the arguments using `sys.argv` and `sys.stdin` but neither of these methods have worked. Currently, I'm trying to run the Docker container using the following command:\n```bash\ndocker run image argument\n```"

        "content": "To pass arguments to a Python script when running a Docker container, you can use the `docker run` command followed by the image name and the arguments you want to pass. The key is to ensure that your Dockerfile is set up correctly to allow arguments to be passed to the Python script. Here is a general approach to accomplish this:\n\n1. **Ensure your Dockerfile is set up with CMD**: The Dockerfile should specify the Python script as the entry point using `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT`. For example:\n\n    ```Dockerfile\n    FROM python:3.8-slim\n\n    WORKDIR /app\n\n    COPY your_script.py .\n\n    # Use CMD to allow arguments to be passed\n    CMD [\"python\", \"your_script.py\"]\n    ```\n\n2. **Modify your Python script to handle arguments**: Make sure your Python script is set up to handle command-line arguments using the `sys.argv` list. Here's a simple example of how you can do this:\n\n    ```python\n    import sys\n\n    def main(args):\n        print(\"Arguments passed to the script:\", args)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main(sys.argv[1:])  # sys.argv[0] is the script name, so we skip it\n    ```\n\n3. **Run the Docker container with arguments**: You can run the Docker container and pass arguments like this:\n\n    ```bash\n    docker run <image> arg1 arg2 arg3\n    ```\n\n    Replace `<image>` with the name of your Docker image and `arg1 arg2 arg3` with the actual arguments you want to pass to your script.\n\n4. **Testing**: When you run the above command, the arguments `arg1`, `arg2`, and `arg3` should be passed to your Python script and processed as expected.\n\nBy setting up your Dockerfile with `CMD` (or `ENTRYPOINT`) and ensuring your Python script can handle command-line arguments, you should be able to pass arguments to the script when the Docker container is run. If you encounter any issues, make sure that your Docker image is rebuilt after making changes to the Dockerfile or the script."
