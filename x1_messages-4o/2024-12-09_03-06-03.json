        "content": "The error message you're encountering suggests that the MySQL server requires a secure authentication plugin such as `sha256_password` or `caching_sha2_password`, but the necessary cryptographic library is not installed or configured correctly in your Python environment.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to install the `cryptography` package, which provides the necessary support for these authentication methods. You can do this using `pip`, the Python package manager. Follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install the `cryptography` package:**\n   Open your command line interface and run the following command:\n   ```bash\n   pip install cryptography\n   ```\n\n2. **Ensure all dependencies are met:**\n   Make sure that your environment has all the necessary dependencies and that they are up to date. You can update `pip` and other packages as needed:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify the installation:**\n   After installing the `cryptography` package, verify that it has been installed correctly by trying to import it in a Python shell:\n   ```python\n   import cryptography\n   ```\n\n4. **Reconnect using your script:**\n   Once the package is installed, try running your script again to see if the error persists.\n\nIf you still face issues, ensure that your Python environment is activated (if you're using a virtual environment) and that there are no conflicting versions of packages.\n\nAdditionally, you might want to check if there are any specific configurations required for your MySQL server's authentication method, and ensure that your user credentials and connection settings are correct."
