For example, if I have a script like the one below, I would like to know what Python version each line or function needs to function properly:\n\n```python\n$ magic_tool <EOF\nwith something:\n    pass\nEOF\n1: 'with' statement requires Python 2.6 or greater\n\n$ magic_tool <EOF\nclass Something:\n    @classmethod\n    def blah(cls):\n        pass\nEOF\n2: classmethod requires Python 2.2 or greater\n$ magic_tool <EOF\nprint \"\"\"Test\n\"\"\"\nEOF\n1: Triple-quote requires Python 1.5 of later\n```\nWould it be possible to create such a tool? I'm considering having all Python versions on disc, running the script with each one and seeing what errors occur as a potential solution."

        "content": "Creating a tool that analyzes a Python script to determine the minimum Python version required for each line or function is an interesting challenge. While there isn't an existing tool that does exactly what you described, it's certainly possible to create one. Here are a few ideas on how you might approach building such a tool:\n\n1. **Syntax and Feature Analysis**: \n   - You could create a parser that examines the script for specific syntax and features introduced in various Python versions. This would involve building a mapping of Python features to the versions they were introduced in and then scanning the script to identify these features.\n\n2. **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) Analysis**:\n   - Python provides the `ast` module, which you can use to parse Python code into its abstract syntax tree. You can then analyze this tree to identify usage of specific features and match them with their corresponding minimum Python versions.\n\n3. **Static Code Analysis**:\n   - Similar to tools like Pylint, you could create a static analysis tool that checks the code against a database of features and their corresponding Python versions. This tool could report the earliest version needed based on the features it detects.\n\n4. **Trial and Error with Multiple Python Versions**:\n   - As you mentioned, you could run the script under different Python versions and capture any syntax errors or exceptions. This approach might be more cumbersome and slower, as it would require setting up multiple environments and executing the script in each one.\n\n5. **Existing Tools and Libraries**:\n   - While there isn't an exact tool for this, some existing tools might help in the process. For instance, `futurize` and `modernize` are tools that help update Python 2 code to Python 3, and they might provide some insights into version compatibility.\n   - Additionally, the `vermin` tool can help determine the minimum Python version required for the entire script, though it doesn't provide line-by-line analysis.\n\nCreating such a tool would involve a good understanding of the Python language's evolution and could be a valuable resource for developers maintaining code across multiple Python versions. If you pursue this, building a database of Python features and their introduction versions would be a crucial step."
