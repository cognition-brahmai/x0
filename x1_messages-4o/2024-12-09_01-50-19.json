        "content": "In Python, you don't have a direct equivalent to PHP's `foreach` loop with reference, primarily because Python handles variables and objects differently. However, there are more Pythonic ways to achieve the same result without using indices directly, which can make your code cleaner and more readable.\n\nOne such approach is using list comprehensions, which are concise and efficient:\n\n```python\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n# Increase value of all items by 1 using list comprehension\narray = [x + 1 for x in array]\n\nprint(array)  # Output: [2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\nIf you want to modify the list in place, you can use the `enumerate` function along with a loop:\n\n```python\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n# Increase value of all items by 1 using enumerate\nfor i, value in enumerate(array):\n    array[i] = value + 1\n\nprint(array)  # Output: [2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\nBoth of these methods avoid using the range and index manipulation directly, making your code more Pythonic and easier to read."
