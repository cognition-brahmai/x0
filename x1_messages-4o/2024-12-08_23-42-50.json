The function takes a list as input, sorts it in descending order, and then prints the last three elements.\n\n```python\ndef print_last_three_sorted(lst):\n    # Sort the list in descending order\n    sorted_lst = sorted(lst, reverse=True)\n    \n    # Get the last three elements\n    last_three = sorted_lst[-3:]\n    \n    # Print the last three elements\n    print(\"Last three elements in descending order:\", last_three)\n\n# Example usage\nexample_list = [5, 3, 8, 1, 9, 2, 4, 7]\nprint_last_three_sorted(example_list)\n```\n\nThis function first sorts the input list in descending order using `sorted(lst, reverse=True)`. It then extracts the last three elements using slicing `[-3:]` and prints them out."
