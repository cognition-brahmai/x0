If you are not getting the expected output, here are a few things you can check:\n\n1. **Input Data:** Ensure that the list you are passing to the function actually contains the numbers you expect.\n\n2. **Function Call:** Make sure you are calling the function correctly, like this:\n\n    ```python\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    squared_numbers = square_list(numbers)\n    print(squared_numbers)  # This should output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n    ```\n\n3. **Naming Conflicts:** Avoid using the name `list` as a variable, since it shadows the built-in `list` type in Python. Consider renaming it to something like `numbers` or `nums`.\n\nHere's the slightly revised version of your function to avoid shadowing the built-in `list`:\n\n```python\ndef square_list(nums):\n    square = []\n    for num in nums:\n        square.append(num * num)\n    return square\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nsquared_numbers = square_list(numbers)\nprint(squared_numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n```\n\nIf after these checks you are still facing issues, please provide more details about the error or unexpected behavior you are encountering."
