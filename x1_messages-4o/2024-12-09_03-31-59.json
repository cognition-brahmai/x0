I have set the last layer to 3 because that's the number of classes I'm working with. What could be causing this issue and how can I resolve it?"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering indicates a mismatch between the expected shape of the output layer and the shape of the target (label) data. Specifically, the model expects the target to have a shape of `(3,)`, but it is receiving target data with shape `(1,)`. This suggests that your target data is not properly one-hot encoded, which is necessary when working with a multi-class classification problem in Keras.\n\nHere are the steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Your Labels:**\n   Make sure that your labels are properly one-hot encoded. If your labels are currently integers representing class indices (e.g., `0`, `1`, `2`), you need to convert them into one-hot encoded vectors. For example, if you have 3 classes, the labels should be converted as follows:\n   - `0` -> `[1, 0, 0]`\n   - `1` -> `[0, 1, 0]`\n   - `2` -> `[0, 0, 1]`\n\n2. **Use Keras Utility for One-Hot Encoding:**\n   You can use Keras' `to_categorical` utility to convert your labels to one-hot encoding format:\n   ```python\n   from keras.utils import to_categorical\n\n   # Assuming y_train and y_test are your label arrays\n   y_train = to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=3)\n   y_test = to_categorical(y_test, num_classes=3)\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify Model Output Layer:**\n   Ensure that the output layer of your model is correctly set up for 3 classes with a softmax activation function:\n   ```python\n   from keras.layers import Dense\n   from keras.models import Sequential\n\n   model = Sequential()\n   # ... Add other layers here ...\n   model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax'))  # Output layer\n   ```\n\n4. **Check Model Compilation:**\n   When compiling your model, ensure that you are using an appropriate loss function. For multi-class classification, use `categorical_crossentropy`:\n   ```python\n   model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])\n   ```\n\nBy ensuring your labels are one-hot encoded and your model is set up correctly, you should be able to resolve the ValueError and successfully train your model."
