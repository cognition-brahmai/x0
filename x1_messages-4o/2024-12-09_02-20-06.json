This could be a search engine, a PR website, etc. I'm not interested in what page from our site they visited, I just want to know which marketing efforts are giving us the most signups. I know Google Analytics can do this, but I'd like to have something internal for reference as well."

        "content": "To capture the referring URL for a Flask request, you can use the `request` object provided by Flask. The `request` object contains all the information about the incoming HTTP request, including the headers. The `Referer` (yes, it's spelled that way due to an early misspelling in the HTTP specification) header contains the URL of the page that linked to the resource being requested.\n\nHere's a simple way to get the referring URL in a Flask application:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/signup', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef signup():\n    referrer = request.referrer  # Get the referring URL\n    if referrer:\n        # Log the referrer or save it in your database\n        print(f\"Referrer: {referrer}\")\n        # Here you can add logic to save the referrer to your database for analysis\n\n    # Your sign-up logic goes here\n\n    return \"Thank you for signing up!\"\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n### Important Considerations\n\n1. **Referrer Header**: The `Referer` header is not always reliable. Users can disable it in their browsers, and some privacy-focused browsers or extensions might strip it out. Moreover, when navigating from HTTPS to HTTP, the referrer might not be sent due to security restrictions.\n\n2. **Cross-Origin Requests**: If your signup page is loaded in an iframe or similar, the referrer might not be sent depending on the embedding website's policies.\n\n3. **Privacy and Compliance**: Make sure you comply with privacy laws and regulations, such as GDPR or CCPA, when collecting and storing user data.\n\n4. **Analytics and Tracking**: This method will give you basic referrer tracking, but for more detailed analytics, integrating a dedicated analytics service or tool might be beneficial.\n\nBy capturing this information internally, you can analyze which external sites or marketing efforts are driving the most traffic to your sign-up page."
