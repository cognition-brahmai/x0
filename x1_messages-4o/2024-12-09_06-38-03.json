I am creating a game that requires the player to guess a country's capital, and I need the questions to be presented randomly. The dictionary is structured like this: {'VENEZUELA':'CARACAS'}.

        "content": "To retrieve a random pair from a dictionary in Python, you can use the `random` module, which provides various functions to work with randomization. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. Import the `random` module.\n2. Convert the dictionary items into a list of tuples using the `items()` method.\n3. Use `random.choice()` to select a random item from this list of tuples.\n\nHere's a sample code snippet to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# Your dictionary of countries and capitals\ncountry_capital_dict = {\n    'VENEZUELA': 'CARACAS',\n    'FRANCE': 'PARIS',\n    'JAPAN': 'TOKYO',\n    # Add more country-capital pairs as needed\n}\n\n# Convert the dictionary items to a list of tuples\nitems = list(country_capital_dict.items())\n\n# Select a random pair (country, capital)\nrandom_pair = random.choice(items)\n\n# Unpack the random pair into separate variables\ncountry, capital = random_pair\n\n# You can then use these variables in your game\nprint(f\"Guess the capital of {country}!\")\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that each time you run this snippet, a random country-capital pair is selected from your dictionary, which can then be used to present a question to the player in your game."
