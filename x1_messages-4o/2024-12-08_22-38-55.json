        "content": "To solve these equations, let's first try to understand the pattern or operation that each symbol might represent by comparing the left and right sides of each equation:\n\n1. **Equation 1: 10#4 = 20#1**\n   - Let's assume the # operation is some transformation of the numbers.\n   - If we suppose # represents division, then 10 \u00f7 4 = 2.5 and 20 \u00f7 1 = 20, which doesn't match.\n   - Another hypothesis could be multiplication and subtraction: \\( (10 \\times 4) - (20 \\times 1) = 40 - 20 = 20 \\).\n   - Using this logic, the missing number is 20.\n\n2. **Equation 2: 8&4 = 4&16**\n   - If & represents an operation like multiplication, then 8 & 4 becomes 32 and 4 & 16 becomes 64.\n   - Alternatively, consider a pattern where 8 is divided by 4 to get 2, and 4 is divided by 16 to yield 0.25.\n   - Using subtraction and addition: \\( (8 \\times 4) - (4 \\times 16) = 32 - 64 = -32 \\).\n   - The missing number could be 0 based on a balancing operation.\n\n3. **Equation 3: 2@3 = 8@1**\n   - Suppose @ represents addition: 2 + 3 = 5 and 8 + 1 = 9, which doesn\u2019t match.\n   - Consider @ as exponentiation: \\( 2^3 = 8 \\) and \\( 8^1 = 8 \\).\n   - The missing number is 8.\n\n4. **Equation 4: 6$3 = 2$9**\n   - Assume $ is subtraction: 6 - 3 = 3 and 2 - 9 = -7, which doesn\u2019t match.\n   - Alternatively, try: \\( (6 \\div 3) \\) equals 2 and \\( (2 \\div 9) \\) equals approximately 0.22.\n   - If $ represents the modulus or remainder, then 6 mod 3 = 0 and 2 mod 9 = 2.\n   - The missing number is 2.\n\n5. **Equation 5: 7*3 = 3*21**\n   - If * is multiplication, then 7 x 3 = 21, and 3 x 21 = 63, which doesn\u2019t match.\n   - If we assume * could mean reversing the digits: \\( 3 \\) becomes 30, and 21 becomes 12.\n   - The missing number is 12.\n\nThe missing numbers from each equation are: 20, 0, 8, 2, and 12.
