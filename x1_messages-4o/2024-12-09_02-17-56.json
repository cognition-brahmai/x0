Should I set up Apache/Cherokee/MySQL manually or is there a script I could use for that? Is it recommended to put everything in virtualenv and use --no-site-packages? Should I use one virtualenv for several projects? What are the best uses for Fabric in deployment and where should I put my Fabric scripts - on the client or the server? How is database and media file migration handled? Is there a need for a build tool such as SCons? And finally, what are the steps of deployment and how often should I perform each of them?"

        "content": "Certainly! Let's break down your questions:\n\n### Efficient Use of pip, virtualenv, and Fabric for Deployment\n\n#### pip and Virtualenv:\n1. **pip Bundles vs. Downloading:**\n   - **pip bundles** can be useful when you need to ensure all team members have the same package versions, especially in environments without internet access. However, they are not frequently used as pip can handle versioning efficiently with `requirements.txt`.\n   - **Always downloading** is generally more convenient and ensures you get the latest compatible versions, unless you need to freeze your dependencies for production stability.\n\n2. **Setting up Environments:**\n   - **Virtualenv** is essential for creating isolated environments. Always use `virtualenv` for each project to avoid dependency conflicts.\n   - Use `--no-site-packages` to ensure a clean environment without global site packages, which is the default behavior in recent versions of virtualenv.\n\n3. **Single vs. Multiple Virtualenvs:**\n   - Typically, you should use one virtualenv per project to maintain independent dependencies and configurations.\n\n#### Apache/Cherokee/MySQL Setup:\n- Manual setup allows for fine-tuning and understanding of configurations. However, using scripts or configuration management tools like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef can automate the setup process and ensure consistency across environments.\n- For simple deployments, shell scripts can suffice, but for larger setups, consider using these tools.\n\n#### Fabric:\n- **Best Uses:**\n  - Automate deployment tasks like pulling code from a repository, restarting services, and running database migrations.\n  - Manage remote servers by executing shell commands over SSH.\n- **Where to Place Scripts:**\n  - Fabric scripts are typically kept in the project repository so they can be version-controlled. They are executed from the client machine to perform tasks on the server.\n\n#### Database and Media File Migration:\n- **Database Migration:**\n  - Use tools like Alembic (for SQLAlchemy) or Django's migration framework to handle database schema changes.\n- **Media Files:**\n  - Depending on your setup, use rsync or cloud storage solutions to handle media file synchronization.\n\n#### Build Tools (e.g., SCons):\n- Build tools are less common in Python deployments unless you have specific compilation tasks. For most web apps, you won't need them.\n\n### Deployment Steps and Frequency:\n1. **Development:**\n   - Code regularly, commit often, and push to a version control system (e.g., Git).\n\n2. **Testing:**\n   - Run automated tests on a continuous integration server after each commit/push.\n\n3. **Staging:**\n   - Deploy to a staging environment to test the application in a production-like setting.\n\n4. **Production Deployment:**\n   - Deploy to production using Fabric or similar tools.\n   - This involves pulling the latest code, installing dependencies, running migrations, and restarting services.\n\n5. **Post-Deployment Checks:**\n   - Ensure the application is running smoothly and monitor logs for any errors.\n\n**Frequency:**\n- Deployment frequency depends on your workflow. Many teams deploy multiple times a day (continuous deployment), while others may deploy weekly or bi-weekly. The key is to automate as much as possible and ensure each deployment is smooth and fast.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can create a robust deployment process that minimizes downtime and ensures consistency across environments."
