        "content": "To create a regular expression in PHP that matches email addresses ending with \".edu\" or \".com\" for the domain names of the top 10 universities in the United States, you need to list those specific domains in your regex pattern. In your example, you already have a good start, but you'll want to ensure that you include only the domains of the top universities and make sure the pattern is correct.\n\nBelow is an updated PHP code implementation with a regular expression that matches email addresses from the top 10 U.S. universities:\n\n```php\n<?php\n$email = \"example@domain.com\";\n\n// List of domains for top 10 universities\n$regex = '/^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@(?:harvard\\.edu|stanford\\.edu|mit\\.edu|princeton\\.edu|caltech\\.edu|upenn\\.edu|columbia\\.edu|duke\\.edu|yale\\.edu|uchicago\\.edu)\\.edu$/i';\n\nif (preg_match($regex, $email)) {\n    echo \"Match\";\n} else {\n    echo \"No match\";\n}\n?>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The regex pattern `^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@` ensures that the email starts with a typical username format followed by an `@` symbol.\n- `(?:harvard\\.edu|stanford\\.edu|mit\\.edu|princeton\\.edu|caltech\\.edu|upenn\\.edu|columbia\\.edu|duke\\.edu|yale\\.edu|uchicago\\.edu)` is a non-capturing group that matches any of the specified university domains.\n- `\\.edu$` ensures that the email ends with \".edu\".\n- The `i` flag at the end makes the regex case-insensitive, allowing for uppercase domains.\n\n### Note:\nThis pattern strictly checks for the \".edu\" domain for the specified universities, as \".edu\" is more common for educational institutions. If you want to include \".com\" domains for any specific university email addresses, you can modify the pattern accordingly, but typically \".edu\" is the intended TLD for universities."
