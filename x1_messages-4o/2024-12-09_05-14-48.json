        "content": "Reading only the first 'n' rows directly from a parquet file is not straightforward because the Parquet format is designed to be read in column chunks rather than row chunks, which optimizes for columnar storage and efficient compression. However, you can use a workaround using `pyarrow`, which is one of the underlying libraries used for handling parquet files.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Using PyArrow:**\n\n   You can leverage `pyarrow` to read a specific number of rows from a parquet file. Here's an example of how you might do this:\n\n   ```python\n   import pyarrow.parquet as pq\n   import pandas as pd\n   \n   # Open the parquet file\n   parquet_file = pq.ParquetFile('filepath')\n\n   # Read the first 'n' rows\n   n = 10\n   dataframe = parquet_file.read_row_group(0, columns=None).to_pandas().head(n)\n\n   print(dataframe)\n   ```\n\n   Note: This method reads an entire row group into memory and then slices it to get the first 'n' rows. If your file is large and contains multiple row groups, you might still end up reading more data into memory than desired.\n\n2. **Using Dask:**\n\n   `Dask` is another library that can handle large data sets efficiently and might be useful if `pyarrow` alone doesn't meet your needs. Here\u2019s how you can do it with `Dask`:\n\n   ```python\n   import dask.dataframe as dd\n\n   # Read the parquet file using Dask\n   ddf = dd.read_parquet('filepath')\n\n   # Get the first 'n' rows\n   df = ddf.head(n)\n\n   print(df)\n   ```\n\n   This approach allows you to work with larger-than-memory datasets efficiently and perform operations lazily.\n\nThese methods should allow you to efficiently read only the first 'n' rows by leveraging libraries designed for handling large data sets."
