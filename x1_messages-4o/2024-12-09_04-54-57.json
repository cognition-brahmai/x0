Here is how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef first2(input_string):\n    # Remove any leading or trailing whitespace\n    input_string = input_string.strip()\n    \n    # Extract and return the first two characters\n    return input_string[:2]\n\n# Example usage\nstr1 = \"TN 81 NZ 0025\"\nresult = first2(str1)\nprint(result)  # Output: TN\n```\n\nThis function works by using Python's slicing feature, `input_string[:2]`, which returns the first two characters from the string. The `strip()` method is used to ensure that any leading or trailing whitespace doesn't affect the slicing. You can call this function with any string to get its first two characters."
