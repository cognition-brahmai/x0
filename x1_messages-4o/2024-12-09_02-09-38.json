        "content": "Using the `cut` command alone to extract the last field from a line where the number of fields varies is not straightforward, as `cut` does not have built-in support for identifying the last field without knowing the number of fields in advance.\n\nHowever, you can achieve this by combining `cut` with other shell utilities, such as `rev` (reverse), which allows you to reverse the string so that the last field becomes the first. Here's a way to do that:\n\n```bash\necho \"your input line\" | rev | cut -d' ' -f1 | rev\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n1. `echo \"your input line\"`: This is your input line.\n2. `rev`: This command reverses the entire line.\n3. `cut -d' ' -f1`: This extracts the first field of the reversed line, which corresponds to the last field of the original line.\n4. `rev`: This reverses the extracted field back to its original form.\n\nReplace `\"your input line\"` with your actual data, and adjust the delimiter `-d' '` as needed if your fields are separated by a character other than a space."
