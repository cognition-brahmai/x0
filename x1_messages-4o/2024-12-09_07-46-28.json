For instance, if the string was: `123412345123456`, the output should be `123 - 3 times`, `234 - 3 times`, and `345 - 2 times`. The question was asked in an interview for a data/software engineer position at a hedge fund company in New York, and they expected the solution to be in Python. They also mentioned that the time complexity for the solution was constant of 1000, as all the possible outcomes are between 000 and 999. Is it possible to come up with a constant time algorithm for this problem?"

        "content": "Yes, it is possible to come up with a constant-time algorithm for this problem because the number of possible three-digit combinations is fixed and finite (ranging from `000` to `999`). Here's a step-by-step solution in Python:\n\n1. **Initialize a Count Array**: Create an array of size 1000 to store the count of each possible three-digit number. Each index in the array corresponds to a three-digit number (e.g., index `123` corresponds to the number `123`).\n\n2. **Iterate Through the String**: Iterate through the string, extract each three-digit substring, convert it to an integer, and increment the corresponding index in the count array.\n\n3. **Output the Results**: After processing the entire string, iterate through the count array to find indices with counts greater than 1 and output those as the repeating three-digit numbers.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef find_repeating_triplets(number_string):\n    # Initialize the count array\n    count = [0] * 1000\n    \n    # Iterate through the string to count all three-digit numbers\n    for i in range(len(number_string) - 2):\n        triplet = number_string[i:i+3]\n        index = int(triplet)\n        count[index] += 1\n    \n    # Output the triplets that repeat\n    for i in range(1000):\n        if count[i] > 1:\n            print(f\"{i:03} - {count[i]} times\")\n\n# Example usage\nnumber_string = \"123412345123456\"\nfind_repeating_triplets(number_string)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Constant Time Complexity**: The algorithm's time complexity is O(n) for iterating through the string, but since the output operation involves a fixed-size count array of 1000 elements, the overall complexity is effectively constant with respect to the number of possible three-digit numbers (i.e., 1000).\n- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) with respect to the input size since the size of the count array is constant.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the occurrences of each three-digit number, ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraints of constant time complexity with respect to the number of possible three-digit sequences."
