Despite multiple installations and re-installations, whenever I try to use tensorflow.placeholder() I get the following error: \"'module' object has no attribute 'placeholder'\". The code that's causing the issue is very basic, it's just creating a placeholder for features:\n\n```python\ntf_in = tf.placeholder(\"float\", [None, A]) # Features\n```\n\nAnd the traceback I get is:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/willim/PycharmProjects/tensorflow/tensorflow.py\", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;\n    import tensorflow as tf\n  File \"/home/willim/PycharmProjects/tensorflow/tensorflow.py\", line 53, in &lt;module&gt;\n    tf_in = tf.placeholder(\"float\", [None, A]) # Features\nAttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'placeholder'\n```\n\nCan anyone provide a solution to this issue?"

        "content": "The error you are encountering is commonly due to a naming conflict with your own Python file. It looks like your script is named `tensorflow.py`, which is the same name as the TensorFlow module. When you try to import TensorFlow using `import tensorflow as tf`, Python is trying to import your script instead of the actual TensorFlow library, leading to the `'module' object has no attribute 'placeholder'` error.\n\nHere's how you can resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Rename Your Script**: Change the name of your Python script from `tensorflow.py` to something else, like `my_tensorflow_script.py`. This will prevent the name conflict.\n\n2. **Remove Compiled Files**: After renaming the script, make sure to delete any compiled Python files (`tensorflow.pyc` or `__pycache__` folder) that may have been generated in the same directory. These files can also cause conflicts.\n\n3. **Check Import Path**: Ensure that there are no other files named `tensorflow.py` in your project's directory structure that could be causing similar conflicts.\n\nOnce you have completed these steps, try running your script again. It should now correctly import the TensorFlow library and allow you to use `tf.placeholder()` without issues.\n\nAdditionally, note that TensorFlow has evolved over time, and the use of `tf.placeholder()` is more common in TensorFlow 1.x. If you are using TensorFlow 2.x, you might want to use `tf.function` or `tf.keras.layers.Input` as TensorFlow 2.x promotes an eager execution model and the Keras API."
