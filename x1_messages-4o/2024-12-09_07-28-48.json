        "content": "I am currently developing an application using Python which will require extensive handling of BC dates such as storage, retrieval, and calculations in a database. Most of these dates will have varying degrees of uncertainty, for instance, \"around 2000BC\". I am aware that Python's datetime library only handles dates from 1 AD. I have discovered FlexiDate but are there any other options? The most effective strategy may be to store them as strings and have a custom datetime class which can make some numerical sense of it. The majority of dates will likely only consist of a year. I am also looking to solve problems like \"early 500BC\", \"between 1600BC and 1500BC\", \"before 1800BC\"."

        "content": "Handling BC dates with varying levels of precision and uncertainty can indeed be challenging, especially since many standard libraries like Python's `datetime` don't support BC dates. Here are some strategies and tools that you can consider for your application:\n\n1. **Custom Date Class**: As you mentioned, creating a custom date class could be a viable solution. You can design this class to handle BC dates as strings initially and provide methods to parse and manipulate these strings. This approach gives you the flexibility to define how to handle uncertainties like \"around\", \"early\", \"between\", etc.\n\n2. **ISO 8601 Extended**: You might consider using a format inspired by ISO 8601 for representing uncertain dates, extending it to handle BC dates. You can represent ranges and uncertainties using notations that make sense for your use case, such as `~2000BC` for \"around 2000BC\" or `1500BC-1600BC` for a range.\n\n3. **Store as Strings**: Use a consistent string format to store dates in your database, like `-2000` for 2000BC (negative sign to indicate BC). This makes it easier to sort and compare dates when needed.\n\n4. **Use of Libraries**:\n    - **FlexiDate**: As you mentioned, FlexiDate is one library that can help with uncertain dates. \n    - **Pendulum**: While Pendulum doesn't directly support BC dates, you might extend it or use it in combination with your custom solution for handling AD dates and then merging functionalities for BC dates.\n    - **Arrow**: Similar to Pendulum, Arrow focuses on ease of use and more intuitive handling of dates and times, but you would need to extend it for BC handling.\n\n5. **Database Strategies**:\n    - **Custom Storage**: Store dates as strings in your database and use the application layer to interpret these strings.\n    - **Separate Fields**: Use separate fields to store year, era (BC/AD), and additional metadata for uncertainty (such as `around`, `between`, etc.).\n    - **Range Storage**: For ranges, consider using two fields to store start and end years.\n\n6. **Handling Uncertainty**: \n    - Define a clear set of rules for interpreting terms like \"early\", \"mid\", \"late\", and \"around\". For example, \"early 500BC\" might be interpreted as a range from 525BC to 500BC.\n    - Store metadata about the certainty of each date in your database to allow nuanced query handling.\n\n7. **Query Logic**: Implement logic in your application to handle queries involving uncertain dates. This might involve converting user input into a standardized form that your custom date class can interpret.\n\nBy combining these strategies, you should be able to effectively handle BC dates with varying degrees of uncertainty in your application."
