For instance, when I calculate the inverse tan of 1.18 using the code `math.atan(1.18)`, I get 0.8677 as the output. However, the answer I am expecting is 49.720136931. Can someone help me understand how to correctly calculate the inverse tan in Python?"

        "content": "When you calculate the inverse tangent (arctan) in Python using the `math.atan()` function, the result is given in radians. This is because the default unit for angles in most mathematical functions in Python is radians.\n\nTo convert the result from radians to degrees (which is often the expected output for angles in degrees), you can use the `math.degrees()` function. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the arctan of 1.18\nradians_result = math.atan(1.18)\n\n# Convert the result from radians to degrees\ndegrees_result = math.degrees(radians_result)\n\nprint(degrees_result)\n```\n\nThis will give you the expected result in degrees, which should be approximately 49.720136931 degrees. Make sure to import the `math` module and use `math.degrees()` to convert radians to degrees."
