        "content": "Certainly! Let's create a complex mathematical equation with a solution of 13. We'll involve at least three different mathematical operations and include two variables. Here is a possible equation:\n\n\\[ 2x + 3y - 5 = 13 \\]\n\n### Step-by-step Explanation:\n\n1. **Choose the Variables and Operations**: \n   - We have two variables, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n   - The operations involved are multiplication, addition, and subtraction.\n\n2. **Set up the Equation**:\n   - Start with a simple linear equation: \\(2x + 3y - 5 = 13\\).\n\n3. **Solve the Equation**:\n   - To isolate the variables and solve, first add 5 to both sides of the equation:\n     \\[\n     2x + 3y - 5 + 5 = 13 + 5\n     \\]\n     Simplifying gives:\n     \\[\n     2x + 3y = 18\n     \\]\n\n4. **Choose a Value for One Variable**:\n   - To solve for specific values, choose a value for \\(x\\) or \\(y\\). Let's say \\(x = 3\\).\n\n5. **Substitute and Solve for the Other Variable**:\n   - Substitute \\(x = 3\\) into the equation:\n     \\[\n     2(3) + 3y = 18\n     \\]\n     Simplify:\n     \\[\n     6 + 3y = 18\n     \\]\n\n   - Subtract 6 from both sides to solve for \\(y\\):\n     \\[\n     3y = 18 - 6\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3y = 12\n     \\]\n\n   - Divide both sides by 3:\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{12}{3}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y = 4\n     \\]\n\n6. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\(x = 3\\) and \\(y = 4\\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:\n     \\[\n     2(3) + 3(4) - 5 = 13\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     6 + 12 - 5 = 13\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     18 - 5 = 13\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     13 = 13\n     \\]\n\nThe solution satisfies the equation, and thus, we have successfully created and solved a complex mathematical equation involving two variables and three operations with the solution of 13."
