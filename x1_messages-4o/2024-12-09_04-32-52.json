However, it only seems to execute as a result of calling `run_until_complete` method and stops executing once the `some_func` function is completed. How can I make the `while_loop` function to keep running even after `some_func` is completed? Here is my current code:\n\n```\nimport asyncio\n\nloop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n\nasync def while_loop():\n    n = 0\n    while True:\n        print(f\"{n}\")\n        await asyncio.sleep(2)\n        n = n+1\n\nasync def some_func():\n    await asyncio.sleep(5)\n    print(\"Some Func\")\n\nfuture = loop.create_task(while_loop())\nloop.run_until_complete(some_func())\n```\n\nThe output I am getting is:\n\n```\n0\n1\n2\nSome Func\n```\n\nBut I am expecting the numbers to keep printing like this:\n\n```\n0\n1\n2\nSome Func\n3\n4\n5\n6\n.\n.\n.\n```"

        "content": "To achieve the behavior you want, where the `while_loop` continues to run indefinitely even after `some_func` completes, you can use the `asyncio.gather()` function. This function allows you to run multiple coroutines concurrently.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired output:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def while_loop():\n    n = 0\n    while True:\n        print(f\"{n}\")\n        await asyncio.sleep(2)\n        n += 1\n\nasync def some_func():\n    await asyncio.sleep(5)\n    print(\"Some Func\")\n\nasync def main():\n    # Run both while_loop and some_func concurrently\n    await asyncio.gather(while_loop(), some_func())\n\n# Use the asyncio.run() function to run the main coroutine\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nIn this modified code:\n\n- I defined an `async def main()` function that uses `asyncio.gather()` to run both `while_loop()` and `some_func()` concurrently.\n- I use `asyncio.run(main())` to run the `main` coroutine that manages both tasks. This ensures that both `while_loop` and `some_func` run concurrently, and the `while_loop` continues even after `some_func` completes."
