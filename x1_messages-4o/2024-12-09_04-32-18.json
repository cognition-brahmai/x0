I want to avoid writing the names of the functions twice to prevent potential bugs. Here's an example of what I'm trying to do:\n\n```python\nmy_list = [x, y, z]  # x, y, z have been previously defined\n\nfor bla in my_list:\n    print \"handling object \", name(bla)  # <--- what would go instead of `name`?\n    # do something to bla\n```\n\nI have defined functions like this:\n\n```python\ndef fun1:\n    pass\ndef fun2:\n    pass\ndef fun3:\n    pass\n\nfun_dict = {'fun1': fun1,\n            'fun2': fun2,\n            'fun3': fun3}\n```\n\nI get the name of the function from the commandline and I want to call the relevant function:\n\n```python\nfunc_name = parse_commandline()\n\nfun_dict[func_name]()\n```\n\nWhat I want to do is:\n\n```python\nfun_list = [fun1, fun2, fun3]  # and I'll add more as the need arises\n\nfun_dict = {}\n[fun_dict[name(t) = t for t in fun_list]  # <-- this is where I need the name function\n```\n\nSo, how can I get the name of an object in Python?"

        "content": "In Python, you can't directly get the variable name that references an object because names are simply references to objects in memory. However, you can achieve what you're looking for in a slightly different way by using the function's `__name__` attribute. This attribute holds the name of the function as a string.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired functionality:\n\n```python\ndef fun1():\n    pass\n\ndef fun2():\n    pass\n\ndef fun3():\n    pass\n\n# Create a list of functions\nfun_list = [fun1, fun2, fun3]\n\n# Create a dictionary mapping function names to the functions themselves\nfun_dict = {func.__name__: func for func in fun_list}\n\n# Example: getting the function name from the command line (replace this with actual command line parsing)\nfunc_name = 'fun2'  # Example command line input\n\n# Call the function using the name\nif func_name in fun_dict:\n    fun_dict[func_name]()\nelse:\n    print(f\"Function '{func_name}' not found.\")\n```\n\nIn this setup, the list `fun_list` contains the function objects, and the dictionary comprehension `{func.__name__: func for func in fun_list}` creates a dictionary mapping function names (as strings) to their corresponding function objects. This way, you can easily call the functions based on their names obtained from the command line or any other source."
