When I try to use the 'fromisoformat' attribute on this object, I receive an error message stating \"AttributeError: type object 'datetime.datetime' has no attribute 'fromisoformat'\". The code I am running is as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\ndatetime.fromisoformat(duedate)\n```\n\nThis code works perfectly fine when I run it using Python 3.7 and 3.8 instances from Anaconda, but fails with Python 3.6. Even though the 'datetime.py' file contains the 'datetime' class and the 'fromisoformat' method, it seems to be unlinked. I have also tried to explicitly link the 'datetime.py' file with no success, using the following code:\n\n```python\nparent_dir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))\nvendor_dir = os.path.join(parent_dir, 'libs')\nsys.path.append(vendor_dir+os.path.sep+\"datetime.py\")\n```\n\nWhat could be causing this issue and how can I resolve it?"

        "content": "The issue you are encountering is due to the fact that the `fromisoformat` method was introduced in Python 3.7. Therefore, when you run your code on Python 3.6, it doesn't have this method available, leading to the `AttributeError`.\n\nHere's how you can handle this issue:\n\n1. **Check Python Version:** Ensure your code checks for the Python version before attempting to use `fromisoformat`. This will help you avoid invoking the method when running on an unsupported version.\n\n2. **Alternative Parsing Method:** For Python 3.6 or earlier, you can use the `dateutil` library to parse ISO format strings, which provides backward compatibility.\n\nHere is an example of how you can modify your code to handle different Python versions:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# If Python version is less than 3.7, use dateutil\nif sys.version_info < (3, 7):\n    from dateutil import parser\n\n    def fromisoformat(duedate):\n        return parser.isoparse(duedate)\nelse:\n    def fromisoformat(duedate):\n        return datetime.fromisoformat(duedate)\n\n# Use the fromisoformat function\nduedate = \"2023-04-01T12:30:00\"\ndate_obj = fromisoformat(duedate)\nprint(date_obj)\n```\n\n3. **Install `dateutil` Library:** If you choose to use `dateutil`, ensure it is installed in your environment:\n\n```bash\npip install python-dateutil\n```\n\nBy using this approach, your code will be compatible with both Python 3.6 and newer versions."
