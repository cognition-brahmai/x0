I have tried to escape the backslash with different combinations, such as '\\', '\"\\\"', '\\\\', and '\"\\\\\"', but none of these seem to work. I want the output after splitting to be ['1','2','3','4']. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "In Python, the backslash `\\` is used as an escape character in strings. To split a string by a backslash, you need to use a double backslash `\\\\` in your code to represent a literal backslash. Here\u2019s how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\n# Your original string\ns = \"1\\\\2\\\\3\\\\4\"\n\n# Splitting the string using double backslashes\nresult = s.split('\\\\')\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nIn the code above, `s.split('\\\\')` uses the double backslash to correctly interpret the backslash as the delimiter. This will give you the desired output:\n\n```\n['1', '2', '3', '4']\n```\n\nRemember that when you're writing the string in your code, you need to escape each backslash with another backslash, hence the double backslashes `\\\\` in the string `s = \"1\\\\2\\\\3\\\\4\"`."
