        "content": "Creating a chessboard pattern in F# involves generating a grid where each cell alternates between two colors, typically represented as 0 and 1 (or \"black\" and \"white\"). Here's a simple way to achieve this:\n\n```fsharp\nlet generateChessboard n =\n    // Generate the chessboard pattern\n    let chessboard = \n        [ for row in 0 .. n - 1 do\n            yield [ for col in 0 .. n - 1 do\n                      yield if (row + col) % 2 = 0 then \"Black\" else \"White\" ] ]\n    \n    // Print the chessboard\n    chessboard \n    |> List.iter (fun row -> \n        row \n        |> List.iter (fun cell -> printf \"%s \" cell)\n        printfn \"\")\n\ngenerateChessboard 8\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Loop through Rows and Columns:**\n   - We use list comprehensions to iterate over each row and column of the chessboard.\n\n2. **Determine Color:**\n   - For each cell `(row, col)`, we check if the sum `(row + col)` is even or odd. If it's even, we assign \"Black\", and if it's odd, we assign \"White\". This creates the checkerboard pattern.\n\n3. **Print the Chessboard:**\n   - We iterate over each row and print each cell, separated by spaces, to display the chessboard pattern.\n\nYou can call the `generateChessboard` function with any `n` to generate an `n x n` chessboard. For example, `generateChessboard 8` generates a standard 8x8 chessboard."
