If they are permutations of each other, the sorted versions of the strings will be identical. Here's a Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef are_permutations(str1, str2):\n    # If the lengths of the strings are not the same, they cannot be permutations\n    if len(str1) != len(str2):\n        return False\n    \n    # Sort both strings and compare\n    return sorted(str1) == sorted(str2)\n\n# Test the function\nstring1 = \"listen\"\nstring2 = \"silent\"\n\nif are_permutations(string1, string2):\n    print(f'\"{string1}\" and \"{string2}\" are permutations of each other.')\nelse:\n    print(f'\"{string1}\" and \"{string2}\" are not permutations of each other.')\n```\n\nIn this program, the function `are_permutations` first checks if the lengths of the two strings are the same. If not, they cannot be permutations. Then, it sorts both strings and compares them. If they are identical, the strings are permutations of each other."
