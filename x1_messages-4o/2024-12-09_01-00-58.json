Does this warning mean that I am effectively losing data due to the lost connection, or does it mean that the connection is dropped because the pool is full, but the same connection will be retried later on when the connection pool becomes available?"

        "content": "The warning message `'Connection pool is full, discarding connection'` from `urllib3.connectionpool` indicates that the connection pool has reached its maximum capacity, and as a result, one of the connections is being discarded. This does not necessarily mean that data is lost. Instead, it means that the connection in question is not being reused, which is the typical behavior of a connection pool for efficiency reasons.\n\nHere's what happens in this scenario:\n\n1. **Connection Pooling:** `urllib3` uses connection pooling to manage multiple HTTP connections efficiently. The pool allows reusing existing connections rather than creating new ones for each request, which can save time and resources.\n\n2. **Pool Full:** When the connection pool reaches its maximum size, and a new connection is requested, the pool cannot accommodate this new connection while maintaining the limit.\n\n3. **Discarding Connection:** The warning indicates that the pool is discarding one of the existing connections to make room for new ones. This means that the connection is closed rather than reused.\n\n4. **No Data Loss:** Typically, this action does not lead to data loss. The HTTP request that triggered the need for a new connection will either open a new connection or reuse an existing one once space is available again.\n\n5. **Potential Impact:** While there is no data loss, it may impact performance slightly, as opening and closing connections are more resource-intensive than reusing them.\n\nIf you frequently encounter this warning and it impacts your application's performance, consider increasing the size of the connection pool by adjusting the `maxsize` parameter when creating the connection pool. This can help accommodate more simultaneous connections without discarding them."
