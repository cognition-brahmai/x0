Everything was going well until I ran the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt` where the requirements.txt includes:\n\n```\ncffi==1.2.1\ncharacteristic==14.3.0\nConcurrentLogHandler>=0.9.1\ncryptography==0.9.1\n...\n```\n\nI want to install the packages without specifying the version, so I changed the command to: `cat requirements.txt | while read line; do pip install ${line%%[>=]*} --user;done`. However, when I tried to install cryptography, I encountered an error:\n\n```\nbuild/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/_openssl.c:12:24:fatal error:pyconfig.h:No such file or directory \n#include <pyconfig.h>\n```\n\nI have tried multiple solutions, but none have worked. I am using a CentOS 7 system and Python version 2.7.5 (default). How can I solve this issue? Additionally, are there any other Scrapy frameworks that can handle a large number of URLs?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to a missing header file that is typically included with the Python development package. On CentOS, you need to install the Python development package to ensure that you have all the necessary files for compiling Python modules.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Install Python Development Package**: \n   Run the following command to install the Python development tools:\n   ```bash\n   sudo yum install python-devel\n   ```\n\n2. **Install OpenSSL Development Package**: \n   Since you're dealing with cryptography, you may also need the OpenSSL development libraries:\n   ```bash\n   sudo yum install openssl-devel\n   ```\n\n3. **Reinstall the Package**: \n   After installing the necessary development packages, try reinstalling the `cryptography` package:\n   ```bash\n   pip install cryptography --user\n   ```\n\nAs for handling a large number of URLs with Scrapy, apart from setting up a cluster, here are a few suggestions and alternative frameworks that might help:\n\n1. **Scrapy Cluster**: Continue with Scrapy Cluster, which uses Kafka and Redis to distribute the workload across multiple nodes. It's designed for scaling out to handle a large number of URLs.\n\n2. **Scrapy + Frontera**: Frontera is a frontier manager for web crawlers, and it can be integrated with Scrapy to manage a distributed crawling setup efficiently.\n\n3. **Apache Nutch**: This is a well-known open-source web crawler that can be scaled and configured to handle large-scale crawling tasks.\n\n4. **Heritrix**: This is an internet archiving crawler that is also scalable and designed for large crawling jobs.\n\n5. **Custom Distributed System**: You could design a custom distributed system using a combination of tools like RabbitMQ or Kafka for task distribution, Celery for task management, and multiple Scrapy spiders for crawling.\n\nRemember to also optimize your Scrapy settings, such as increasing concurrent requests, configuring appropriate download delays, and using a robust request scheduling strategy to make the most out of your resources."
