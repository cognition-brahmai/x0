Save the image to a `BytesIO` object to simulate saving the file.\n3. Get the size of the `BytesIO` object, which will give you the file size in bytes.\n\nHere's a sample script demonstrating these steps:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport io\n\ndef get_image_size_in_bytes(image_path):\n    # Open the image using PIL\n    with Image.open(image_path) as img:\n        # Create a BytesIO object\n        byte_io = io.BytesIO()\n        \n        # Save the image to the BytesIO object in the original format\n        img.save(byte_io, format=img.format)\n        \n        # Get the size of the BytesIO object in bytes\n        file_size_in_bytes = byte_io.tell()\n        \n    return file_size_in_bytes\n\n# Example usage\nimage_path = 'example.jpg'  # Replace with your image file path\nfile_size = get_image_size_in_bytes(image_path)\nprint(f\"The size of the image is {file_size} bytes.\")\n```\n\nThis script opens the image file, writes it to a `BytesIO` object, and then checks the size of the object to determine the file size in bytes. You can then use this information to decide if the image is too large for uploading to your database."
