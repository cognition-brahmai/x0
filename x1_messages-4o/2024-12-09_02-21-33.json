        "content": "To calculate the runtime of a program in Python, you can use various methods. Here are a few common approaches:\n\n1. **Using the `time` module:**\n\n   The `time` module provides a simple way to measure the elapsed time for a given block of code.\n\n   ```python\n   import time\n\n   start_time = time.time()\n\n   # Your code block here\n   for i in range(1000000):\n       pass\n\n   end_time = time.time()\n   elapsed_time = end_time - start_time\n\n   print(f\"Elapsed time: {elapsed_time} seconds\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Using the `timeit` module:**\n\n   The `timeit` module is specifically designed for timing small code snippets with high accuracy.\n\n   ```python\n   import timeit\n\n   def your_function():\n       for i in range(1000000):\n           pass\n\n   elapsed_time = timeit.timeit(your_function, number=1)\n   print(f\"Elapsed time: {elapsed_time} seconds\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Using the `datetime` module:**\n\n   The `datetime` module can be used to timestamp the start and end times, and compute the difference.\n\n   ```python\n   from datetime import datetime\n\n   start_time = datetime.now()\n\n   # Your code block here\n   for i in range(1000000):\n       pass\n\n   end_time = datetime.now()\n   elapsed_time = end_time - start_time\n\n   print(f\"Elapsed time: {elapsed_time}\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Using context managers with `time` or `timeit`:**\n\n   You can also create a context manager to measure the runtime of a block of code, which can make your code cleaner.\n\n   ```python\n   import time\n\n   class Timer:\n       def __enter__(self):\n           self.start_time = time.time()\n           return self\n\n       def __exit__(self, *args):\n           self.end_time = time.time()\n           self.elapsed_time = self.end_time - self.start_time\n           print(f\"Elapsed time: {self.elapsed_time} seconds\")\n\n   with Timer():\n       # Your code block here\n       for i in range(1000000):\n           pass\n   ```\n\nEach of these methods has its own use case, so you can choose one based on the precision you need and the complexity of your code."
