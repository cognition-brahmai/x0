When I check the version of Python installed on my system using `python -V`, it shows Python 3.2.1. However, I also have Python 2.7.2-2 installed on my system. The Python script I'm working with starts with `#!/usr/bin/env python`. I am using Arch Linux. How can I temporarily set Python 2 as my default Python version to solve these compatibility issues?"

        "content": "To temporarily set Python 2 as your default Python version for a specific session or terminal, you can change the `PATH` environment variable to prioritize Python 2. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Open your terminal.**\n\n2. **Find the Python 2 binary path:** You can locate the Python 2 binary by using the `which` command:\n   ```bash\n   which python2\n   ```\n   This command will display the path to the Python 2 binary, typically something like `/usr/bin/python2`.\n\n3. **Modify the `PATH` environment variable:** Prepend the directory containing the Python 2 binary to your `PATH` environment variable in your terminal session. You can do this by executing:\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\n   ```\n   Replace `/usr/bin` with the actual directory you found in the previous step.\n\n4. **Verify the change:** Check the default Python version by running:\n   ```bash\n   python -V\n   ```\n   This should now show Python 2.7.2-2 as the default Python version for this terminal session.\n\n5. **Run your Python script:** Now, when you execute your script, it should use Python 2 by default.\n\nRemember, this change is temporary and will only persist for the current terminal session. If you open a new terminal, you'll need to repeat these steps. If you want to make this change permanent, you would need to modify your shell's configuration file (like `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`) accordingly. However, for temporary testing or debugging purposes, the above method should suffice."
