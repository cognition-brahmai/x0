        "content": "I am implementing a minimax algorithm in Python where I use the built-in `max()` and `min()` functions on lists. However, I need to know the index of the value returned by these functions, i.e., I need to know which move produced the max (at a first player's turn) or min (second player) value. Here is the code snippet for your reference:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(9):\n    new_board = current_board.new_board_with_move([i / 3, i % 3], player)\n\n    if new_board:\n        temp = min_max(new_board, depth + 1, not is_min_level)  \n        values.append(temp)\n\nif is_min_level:\n    return min(values)\nelse:\n    return max(values)\n```\nI am looking for a way to return the actual index of the min or max value, not just the value itself. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To achieve this, you can use the `enumerate` function to keep track of the indices while iterating through the list of values. Once you have the list of calculated values, you can use the `max` or `min` function with a key argument that helps you to determine the index of the maximum or minimum value. Here's how you can modify your code to return the index along with the value:\n\n```python\ndef min_max(current_board, depth, is_min_level):\n    values = []\n\n    for i in range(9):\n        new_board = current_board.new_board_with_move([i // 3, i % 3], player)\n\n        if new_board:\n            temp = min_max(new_board, depth + 1, not is_min_level)\n            values.append((temp, i))  # Store both the value and the index\n\n    if is_min_level:\n        # Find the minimum value and its index\n        min_value, min_index = min(values, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        return min_value, min_index\n    else:\n        # Find the maximum value and its index\n        max_value, max_index = max(values, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        return max_value, max_index\n\n# Example usage:\nvalue, index = min_max(current_board, 0, True)\nprint(f\"The best move is at index {index} with a value of {value}\")\n```\n\nIn this code, `values` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the value calculated by the `min_max` function and the corresponding index `i`. When you call `min` or `max`, you pass a lambda function as the key to compare only the first element of each tuple (i.e., the calculated value), allowing you to return both the value and the index."
