I am now trying to analyze code coverage with coverage.py. However, when I use the pytest-cov plugin, which has subprocess-handling built-in, it does not cover my script when it's called from a temporary testing directory created with py.test's tmpdir fixture. The script is covered when it's called in the directory it resides in. Both tests pass with Coverage 3.6, pytest-2.3.5, pytest-cov 1.6, all from PyPi. How can I get coverage to recognize my script even if it's executed in another directory? Is this a bug in coverage, or something which is just not possible to do?"

        "content": "When you're trying to measure code coverage for a Python script that's executed in a different directory using the `pytest-cov` plugin, there are a few key points to consider in order to ensure that coverage is correctly recognized:\n\n1. **Path Configuration**: Coverage tools often rely on file paths to track which lines of code have been executed. If your script is being executed from a different directory, it might not be correctly associating the executed code with the source files. Make sure you specify the correct paths in your `coverage` configuration. This can be done by setting the `source` parameter in your `.coveragerc` file to point to the directory containing your Python files.\n\n2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure that the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable is set correctly when running your tests. This variable should include the path to your script's directory, allowing Python to locate and import the necessary modules.\n\n3. **pytest-cov Options**: Use the `--cov` option to specify the directory or module for which you want to measure coverage. For example, `pytest --cov=your_module` can help ensure that coverage is collected for the intended module, regardless of the current working directory.\n\n4. **Subprocess Coverage**: Since you are using `subprocess.call`, you need to ensure that subprocess coverage is enabled. The `--cov` option might not automatically handle subprocesses unless specifically configured. You might need to use the `COVERAGE_PROCESS_START` environment variable to point to your `.coveragerc` file, and ensure that the `--parallel` option is used with `pytest-cov` to collect coverage data from subprocesses.\n\n5. **Check for Known Issues**: Sometimes, specific versions of tools have known issues. Check the issue trackers for `pytest`, `pytest-cov`, and `coverage.py` to see if there are any relevant bugs or workarounds.\n\nHere is an example of how you might set up your testing command:\n\n```bash\nCOVERAGE_PROCESS_START=.coveragerc pytest --cov=your_module --cov-report=html --cov-branch\n```\n\nAnd ensure your `.coveragerc` includes:\n\n```ini\n[run]\nbranch = True\nparallel = True\nsource = your_module\n```\n\nBy ensuring that all these configurations are correct, you should be able to get accurate coverage results even when executing your script from different directories."
