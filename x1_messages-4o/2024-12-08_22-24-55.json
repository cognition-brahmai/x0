        "content": "The Go code you've provided is a simple console application that allows the user to select an item from a predefined list: \"Football\", \"Basketball\", and \"Volleyball\". The program then outputs the selected item. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:\n\n1. **Package Declaration and Imports**: \n   - The program begins with the `package main` declaration, which is necessary for any standalone executable Go application.\n   - It imports the necessary packages: `bufio` for buffered I/O, `fmt` for formatted I/O, and `os` for accessing the operating system's functionality.\n\n2. **Main Function**:\n   - The `main` function is the entry point of the program.\n   - An array of strings, `items`, is defined containing the sports.\n\n3. **Displaying Options**:\n   - It prompts the user to \"Select an item:\" and then iterates over the `items` slice, printing each item with a corresponding number using a `for` loop.\n\n4. **Reading User Input**:\n   - It uses `bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)` to read input from the standard input (usually the keyboard).\n   - `scanner.Scan()` reads the user's input.\n\n5. **Selecting and Outputting the Item**:\n   - A `switch` statement is used to determine which item the user selected based on their input.\n   - Depending on the user's input (\"1\", \"2\", or \"3\"), it assigns the corresponding item to the `selected` variable.\n   - Finally, it prints the selected item using `fmt.Printf`.\n\nThis code effectively allows a user to select an item by entering a number corresponding to their choice, and then it outputs the selected item."
