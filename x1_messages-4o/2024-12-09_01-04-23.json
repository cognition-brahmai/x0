For instance, while executing a task 'site1_service_gw' on different servers, if Fabric encounters an error on 'site1fep1' server, it aborts. How can I make Fabric ignore the error and proceed with the task on the next server? Here is my current situation:\n\n```shell\n$ fab site1_service_gw\n[site1rpt1] Executing task 'site1_service_gw'\n\n[site1fep1] run: echo 'Nm123!@#' | sudo -S route\n[site1fep1] err:\n[site1fep1] err: We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System\n[site1fep1] err: Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:\n[site1fep1] err:\n[site1fep1] err:     #1) Respect the privacy of others.\n[site1fep1] err:     #2) Think before you type.\n[site1fep1] err:     #3) With great power comes great responsibility.\n[site1fep1] err: root's password:\n[site1fep1] err: sudo: route: command not found\n\nFatal error: run() encountered an error (return code 1) while executing 'echo 'Nm123!@#' | sudo -S route '\n\nAborting.\n```"

        "content": "To configure Fabric to continue running tasks on the next server after encountering an error on the current server, you can adjust the error handling behavior by using the `env` settings provided by Fabric. Specifically, you can set `env.warn_only` to `True`. This setting allows Fabric to treat errors as warnings rather than fatal errors, which means it will not abort the execution but will continue with the next server.\n\nHere's how you can modify your Fabric script:\n\n```python\nfrom fabric import task\nfrom fabric.connection import Connection\n\n# Set warn_only to True to continue on errors\n@task\ndef site1_service_gw(c):\n    # Enable warning-only mode for this task\n    c.config.run.warn = True\n\n    # Define your list of servers\n    servers = ['site1rpt1', 'site1fep1', 'site1fep2']\n\n    # Iterate over each server and execute the task\n    for host in servers:\n        conn = Connection(host)\n        try:\n            conn.run(\"echo 'Nm123!@#' | sudo -S route\")\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"Error on {host}: {e}. Continuing to next server.\")\n\n# To run the task, use:\n# fab -H <host> site1_service_gw\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **`warn_only` Setting**: By setting `c.config.run.warn = True`, Fabric will not abort on non-zero return codes. Instead, it will treat them as warnings and continue executing the task on the next host.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: You can wrap your task execution in a `try-except` block to handle any exceptions gracefully and log them or take any other necessary action.\n\n3. **Continued Execution**: Once an error is encountered, the next server in the list will be targeted for task execution.\n\n### Note:\n- Ensure that the command you are trying to execute (`sudo route`) is correct and available on your servers. The error \"sudo: route: command not found\" suggests that the `route` command might not be installed or available in the environment where Fabric is running.\n- Make sure that your Fabric version supports these configurations. The code provided assumes Fabric 2.x or later. If you are using Fabric 1.x, the syntax and usage might differ slightly."
