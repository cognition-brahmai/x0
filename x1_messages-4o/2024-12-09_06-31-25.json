        "content": "To calculate the mean average of a list in Python, you can use the built-in `sum()` function to get the total sum of the elements, and then divide that by the number of elements in the list using the `len()` function. Here's how you can do it with your example list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`:\n\n```python\n# Define the list\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n# Calculate the sum of the list\ntotal_sum = sum(numbers)\n\n# Calculate the number of elements in the list\ncount = len(numbers)\n\n# Calculate the mean average\nmean_average = total_sum / count\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"The mean average is:\", mean_average)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\nThe mean average is: 2.5\n```\n\nThis is because the sum of `[1, 2, 3, 4]` is `10`, and dividing that by the number of elements, which is `4`, gives you `2.5`."
