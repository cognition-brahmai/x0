Currently, my code is structured as follows:\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3 as lite\nimport sys\n\ndb = r'someDb.sqlite'\n\ndef opendb(db):\n    try:\n        conn = lite.connect(db)\n    except sqlite3.Error:\n        print \"Error open db.\\n\"\n        return False\n    cur = conn.cursor()\n    return [conn, cur]\n```\n\nFrom my testing, I've found that the `sqlite3` library either opens an existing database or creates a new one if the specified database doesn't exist. Is there a way to check if a SQLite3 database exists using `sqlite3` methods, or do I need to use file operations like `os.path.isfile(path)`?"

        "content": "You're correct in noting that the `sqlite3` library will create a new database file if the specified one does not exist when you attempt to connect to it. However, `sqlite3` itself does not provide a built-in method to check for the existence of a database file before opening it. Therefore, to check if a SQLite database exists, you should use file operations, like `os.path.isfile(path)`, before attempting to open the connection.\n\nHere's how you can modify your function to incorporate this check:\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3 as lite\nimport os\n\ndb = r'someDb.sqlite'\n\ndef opendb(db):\n    if not os.path.isfile(db):\n        print \"Database does not exist.\"\n        return False\n    \n    try:\n        conn = lite.connect(db)\n    except lite.Error as e:\n        print \"Error opening db: {}\".format(e)\n        return False\n    \n    cur = conn.cursor()\n    return [conn, cur]\n```\n\nIn this updated version, the function first checks if the file exists using `os.path.isfile(db)`. If the file does not exist, it prints a message and returns `False`, preventing the creation of a new database inadvertently. If the file exists, it proceeds to open the database and return the connection and cursor."
