Currently, I am using the following loop to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfor i in d:\n    d2[i] = f(d[i])\n```\n\nHowever, I am interested in understanding how I can rewrite this using a more concise Pythonic syntax."

Dictionary comprehensions provide a compact syntax for creating dictionaries from existing dictionaries (or other iterables) by applying a function to each element. Here\u2019s how you can rewrite your loop using a dictionary comprehension:\n\n```python\nd2 = {i: f(d[i]) for i in d}\n```\n\nIn this one-liner, `f(d[i])` is applied to each value in the dictionary `d`, and a new dictionary `d2` is created with the same keys as `d` and the transformed values. This approach is both concise and efficient."
