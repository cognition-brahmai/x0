        "content": "I am trying to override a static method in Python. I have a class Test with a static method called \"method_two\". I created another class T2 that inherits from Test and attempted to override \"method_two\". However, when I create an instance of T2 and call \"method_three\" (which calls the static method \"method_two\"), it doesn't print what I expected. I expected \"T2\", but it prints \"Called method_two\" instead. Is there a way to override a static method in Python?\n\nHere is the code I'm working with:\n```python\nclass Test:\n    def method_one(self):\n        print \"Called method_one\"\n    @staticmethod\n    def method_two():\n        print \"Called method_two\"\n    @staticmethod\n    def method_three():\n        Test.method_two()\nclass T2(Test):\n    @staticmethod\n    def method_two():\n        print \"T2\"\na_test = Test()\na_test.method_one()\na_test.method_two()\na_test.method_three()\nb_test = T2()\nb_test.method_three()\n```\nAnd here is the output I'm currently getting:\n```shell\nCalled method_one\nCalled method_two\nCalled method_two\nCalled method_two\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is because `method_three` in the `Test` class explicitly calls `Test.method_two()`, which means it's directly referencing the `method_two` of the `Test` class, rather than the overridden version in `T2`.\n\nTo achieve the desired behavior, where `method_three` calls the `method_two` of the class it belongs to, you can modify `method_three` to use the class reference `cls` instead of directly calling `Test.method_two()`. This can be accomplished by changing `method_three` to a class method. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nclass Test:\n    def method_one(self):\n        print(\"Called method_one\")\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def method_two():\n        print(\"Called method_two\")\n\n    @classmethod\n    def method_three(cls):\n        cls.method_two()\n\nclass T2(Test):\n    @staticmethod\n    def method_two():\n        print(\"T2\")\n\na_test = Test()\na_test.method_one()\na_test.method_two()\na_test.method_three()\n\nb_test = T2()\nb_test.method_three()\n```\n\nWith this modification, `method_three` is a class method, which means it receives the class (`cls`) as the first argument. By calling `cls.method_two()`, it will use the `method_two` of the specific class that `method_three` is called on. Therefore, when `b_test.method_three()` is called, it will print `T2` as expected."
