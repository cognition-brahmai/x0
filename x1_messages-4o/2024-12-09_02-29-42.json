        "content": "The error message you're encountering, \"A single constraint is not allowed,\" arises because of a misunderstanding in how `TypeVar` constraints work in Python's typing system. In your code, you're attempting to constrain a type variable `T` to a single constraint with `Callable`, which is not the intended use of constraints in `TypeVar`.\n\n### Understanding `TypeVar` Constraints\n\n1. **Single Constraint**: In `TypeVar`, constraints are used to specify a set of possible types that the type variable can take. However, constraints must include more than one option. If you only want a single constraint (like `Callable`), you should use a bound instead.\n\n2. **Bound**: If you want to ensure that a type variable implements or is a subclass of a certain type (such as an abstract base class), you should use the `bound` parameter of `TypeVar`.\n\n### Correcting the Code\n\nTo correct your code and specify that `T` must be a `Callable`, you should use the `bound` parameter as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import TypeVar, Callable, Generic\n\nT = TypeVar('T', bound=Callable)\n\nclass Foo(Generic[T]):\n    ...\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **`Callable`**: This is a special kind of type that represents callable objects, like functions or objects with a `__call__` method.\n- **`bound=Callable`**: This ensures that any type used in place of `T` must be a `Callable`. This is more restrictive than listing multiple constraints and is the appropriate way to enforce that `T` implements or is compatible with the interface of a `Callable`.\n\nBy making this change, your `TypeVar` will correctly enforce that `T` is bound to types that are callable, resolving the `TypeError` you were encountering."
