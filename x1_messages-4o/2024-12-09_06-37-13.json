        "content": "To obtain dictionaries from your SQLite query results in Python, you can use the `sqlite3.Row` class. This allows you to access columns by name, providing a dictionary-like interface. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\n# Connect to the SQLite database\ndb = sqlite3.connect(\"test.sqlite\")\n\n# Set the row factory to sqlite3.Row\ndb.row_factory = sqlite3.Row\n\n# Execute your query\nres = db.execute(\"SELECT * FROM table\")\n\n# Iterate over the results and print them as dictionaries\nfor row in res:\n    row_dict = dict(row)  # Convert the row to a dictionary\n    print(row_dict)\n```\n\nBy setting `db.row_factory = sqlite3.Row`, each row you retrieve from the database will be a `sqlite3.Row` object, which can be easily converted to a dictionary using the `dict()` function. This way, you can access the row data using column names."
