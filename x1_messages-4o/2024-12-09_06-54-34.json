        "content": "When working with Django REST Framework (DRF), `request.data` is typically expected to be a dictionary rather than a string. However, if you're seeing it as a string, it's likely due to the way the data is being sent to your API endpoint. Here are some steps to address the issues you're facing:\n\n### Issue 1: `request.data` as a String\n\n1. **Check Content-Type**: Ensure that the request to your API is being sent with the correct `Content-Type` header. For JSON data, it should be `application/json`. If the header is not set correctly, DRF may not parse the JSON body into a dictionary.\n\n2. **Manual Parsing** (if necessary): If the data is coming as a string (e.g., from a non-standard client or incorrect content type), you can manually parse it using Python's `json` module:\n\n   ```python\n   import json\n\n   if isinstance(request.data, str):\n       request_data = json.loads(request.data)\n   else:\n       request_data = request.data\n   ```\n\n### Issue 2: Modifying `request.data`\n\nOnce you have `request.data` as a dictionary, you can modify it directly:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\nclass YourView(APIView):\n    def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Ensure request.data is a dictionary\n        if isinstance(request.data, str):\n            request_data = json.loads(request.data)\n        else:\n            request_data = request.data\n\n        # Modify the data\n        request_data['age'] = '30'\n\n        # If necessary, update request.data back to a JSON string\n        request.data = json.dumps(request_data)\n\n        # Proceed with the updated data\n        response = super().post(request, *args, **kwargs)\n        return response\n```\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- **Middleware**: If the conversion from string to dictionary is a common issue, you might consider adding middleware to handle this conversion globally.\n\n- **Serializer Validation**: Ensure that your serializers are correctly defined to handle the modified data structure, especially if you're adding new fields dynamically.\n\nFollowing these steps should help you correctly handle and modify `request.data` in your Django REST Framework application."
