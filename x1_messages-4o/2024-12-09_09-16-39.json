One simple way to achieve this is by using a set to keep track of the characters you've encountered, and then reconstructing the string with only unique characters. Here's a sample function that does that:\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicate_characters(input_string):\n    seen = set()\n    result = []\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char not in seen:\n            seen.add(char)\n            result.append(char)\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_str = \"programming\"\noutput_str = remove_duplicate_characters(input_str)\nprint(output_str)  # Output will be \"progamin\"\n```\n\nThis function iterates through the input string, adds characters to a set if they haven't been seen before, and builds a result list with those unique characters. Finally, it joins the list into a string to produce the output without duplicates."
