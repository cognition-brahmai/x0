        "content": "I am confused about some aspects of blocking and cudaMemcpy in CUDA. From what I understand, Fermi hardware is capable of executing kernels and performing a cudaMemcpy simultaneously. However, I've read that the library function cudaMemcpy() is a blocking function. Does this mean that this function will stop further execution until the copy is fully completed? Or does it mean that the copy won't start until the previous kernels have finished executing? To illustrate my confusion, do the following two code snippets provide the same blocking operation?\n\nFirst code snippet:\n```\nSomeCudaCall<<<25,34>>>(someData);\ncudaThreadSynchronize();\n```\nSecond code snippet:\n```\nSomeCudaCall<<<25,34>>>(someParam);\ncudaMemcpy(toHere, fromHere, sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);\n```"

        "content": "Your question revolves around understanding the behavior of CUDA operations, specifically regarding kernel execution and memory transfers, and how they interact with synchronization.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n1. **CUDA Streams and Overlapping**: Modern CUDA-capable GPUs, starting from the Fermi architecture, support overlapping of kernel execution and memory transfers, but this requires the use of streams. By default, operations are placed in the default stream (stream 0), which is a blocking stream. Operations in the default stream are executed sequentially and they block until completion.\n\n2. **Blocking Behavior of `cudaMemcpy()`**: The `cudaMemcpy()` function is indeed blocking when used in the default stream. This means that when you call `cudaMemcpy()`, it will block the host thread until the copy operation is completed. Moreover, it implicitly synchronizes with any previous operations in the default stream.\n\n3. **Code Snippets Comparison**:\n   - **First Code Snippet**: \n     ```cpp\n     SomeCudaCall<<<25,34>>>(someData);\n     cudaThreadSynchronize();\n     ```\n     In this snippet, `cudaThreadSynchronize()` is explicitly called, which blocks the host until all preceding commands in all streams on the CUDA device have completed. This means `SomeCudaCall` finishes before the host moves on past the synchronization point.\n\n   - **Second Code Snippet**:\n     ```cpp\n     SomeCudaCall<<<25,34>>>(someParam);\n     cudaMemcpy(toHere, fromHere, sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);\n     ```\n     Here, `cudaMemcpy()` will block the host thread until the memory copy is completed. Additionally, since it is in the default stream, it will also wait for `SomeCudaCall` to complete before starting the `cudaMemcpy()`.\n\n4. **Do They Provide the Same Blocking Behavior?**: \n   - Yes, in a sense. In the first snippet, `cudaThreadSynchronize()` ensures that the kernel execution is complete before moving forward. In the second snippet, `cudaMemcpy()` enforces the same synchronization implicitly, since it blocks until the kernel execution completes and the memory transfer operation is finished.\n\n5. **Using Streams for Overlap**: If you want to achieve overlap between kernel execution and memory transfers, you need to use non-default streams. For example:\n   ```cpp\n   cudaStream_t stream;\n   cudaStreamCreate(&stream);\n   SomeCudaCall<<<25,34,0,stream>>>(someParam);\n   cudaMemcpyAsync(toHere, fromHere, sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream);\n   ```\n\n   In this scenario, `cudaMemcpyAsync()` in a specific stream allows for potential overlap between the kernel execution and memory transfer, provided there are no resource dependencies.\n\nUnderstanding the behavior of CUDA operations and streams is crucial for optimizing performance and achieving efficient concurrency in your applications."
