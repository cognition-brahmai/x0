        "content": "Why does assigning a new value to my global variable 'a' not work in Python? I'm having difficulty understanding Python's scoping rules. I have a script where I set a global variable 'a' to 7, define two functions - 'printA' which prints the value of 'a' and 'setA' which is supposed to change the value of 'a' to a new value. However, when I run the functions, the value of 'a' doesn't seem to change as I expected. Here is my script:\n\n```python\na = 7\n\ndef printA():\n    print \"Value of a is %d\" % (a)\n\ndef setA(value):\n    a = value\n    print \"Inside setA, a is now %d\" %(a)\n\nprint \"Before setA\"\nprintA()\nsetA(42)\nprint \"After setA\"\nprintA()\n```\nThe output I get is:\n\n```shell\nBefore setA\nValue of a is 7\nInside setA, a is now 42\nAfter setA\nValue of a is 7\n```\nI expected the value of 'a' to be 42 after running 'setA', but it still shows as 7. Can you explain what I'm missing about Python's scope rules for the scoping of global variables?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering relates to Python's handling of variable scope, particularly with respect to global variables. When you assign a value to a variable inside a function, Python treats it as a local variable unless explicitly declared otherwise. Here's a breakdown of what's happening in your script:\n\n1. **Global Declaration**: You have a global variable `a` initialized to 7.\n\n2. **Function `printA`**: This function correctly accesses the global variable `a` and prints its value.\n\n3. **Function `setA`**: When you assign a value to `a` inside this function, Python assumes `a` is a local variable because you didn't specify otherwise. Thus, it creates a new local variable `a` within the scope of the function, which shadows the global variable `a` for the duration of the function. As a result, the global `a` remains unchanged.\n\nTo modify the global variable `a` from within the `setA` function, you need to use the `global` keyword to declare that you intend to use the global variable rather than creating a local one. Here's how you can update your `setA` function:\n\n```python\ndef setA(value):\n    global a  # Declare that you're using the global variable 'a'\n    a = value\n    print \"Inside setA, a is now %d\" % (a)\n```\n\nWith this change, the `setA` function will correctly update the global variable `a`. When you run the script again, you should see the output reflecting the updated value of `a`:\n\n```shell\nBefore setA\nValue of a is 7\nInside setA, a is now 42\nAfter setA\nValue of a is 42\n```\n\nThis use of the `global` keyword informs Python that you want to work with the global variable `a` rather than creating a new local variable, thereby allowing the change to persist outside the function."
