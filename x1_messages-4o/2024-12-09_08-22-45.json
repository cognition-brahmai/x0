A 304 status code, \"Not Modified,\" is actually a type of redirection response that indicates the resource has not been modified since the last request. It doesn't fall under the 2xx success category, hence it is not considered \"ok\" in the sense of `requests.codes.ok`.\n\nIf you want to check if the response is either 200 or 304, you can modify your condition to:\n\n```python\nif response.status_code in [requests.codes.ok, 304]:\n    # Handle the response\n```\n\nThis way, your check will pass for both 200 and 304 status codes."
