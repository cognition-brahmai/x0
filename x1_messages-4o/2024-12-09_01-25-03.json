I'm running into issues when trying to compile it on Windows. I'm using Windows 10, Cmake 3.15, Visual Studio 2017, and CUDA Toolkit 10.1. I've updated my 'CMakeLists.txt' file based on the latest NVIDIA guide to use the new Cmake CUDA support, as the previous method is now deprecated. However, I'm getting an error at line 2 which says \"No CUDA toolset found\". Could you help me solve this problem?"

        "content": "Certainly! The error message \"No CUDA toolset found\" usually indicates that CMake is unable to locate the CUDA toolkit on your system. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify CUDA Installation:**\n   - Ensure that the CUDA Toolkit is installed properly on your system. You can check this by navigating to the directory where CUDA is installed, typically `C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v10.1`.\n\n2. **Environment Variables:**\n   - Make sure that the `CUDA_HOME` environment variable is set correctly. It should point to the root of your CUDA installation, such as `C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v10.1`.\n   - Add the `bin` directory of your CUDA installation to the `PATH` environment variable. This is usually `C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v10.1\\bin`.\n\n3. **CMake Configuration:**\n   - In your `CMakeLists.txt`, ensure that you have the correct version specified. You might include a line like `find_package(CUDA 10.1 REQUIRED)`.\n   - If you're using the `enable_language(CUDA)` command, make sure it\u2019s placed after the `project()` command in your `CMakeLists.txt`.\n\n4. **Visual Studio Integration:**\n   - Verify that the CUDA integration with Visual Studio is set up correctly. You might need to repair or reinstall the CUDA Toolkit to fix any integration issues with Visual Studio.\n\n5. **CMake Version:**\n   - Although you're using CMake 3.15, consider updating to a newer version if possible, as newer versions might have better support for CUDA.\n\n6. **CMake Cache:**\n   - Sometimes old cache files can cause problems. Try deleting the `CMakeCache.txt` file in your build directory and configure your project again.\n\n7. **Visual Studio Command Prompt:**\n   - Open a Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio and try configuring and building your project from there. This ensures that all necessary environment variables are set correctly.\n\n8. **Check CMake Output:**\n   - Run CMake with verbose output to get more detailed information about what it's trying to do. This can sometimes provide insight into what's going wrong: `cmake --verbose`.\n\n9. **Check for Updates:**\n   - Make sure both Visual Studio and the CUDA Toolkit are updated to their latest versions, as sometimes compatibility issues are resolved in newer releases.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"No CUDA toolset found\" error and successfully compile your CUDA program on Windows. If the issue persists, please share any additional error messages or logs for further assistance."
