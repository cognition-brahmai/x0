For instance, when I use `help(object.__eq__)` or `help(object.__init__)`, I see a \"/\" in the method signatures. I initially thought it might be related to keyword-only arguments, but when I create my own function with keyword-only arguments, positional and keyword-only arguments are separated by \"*\" (as expected), not by \"/\". So what does this \"/\" represent in the method signature?"

        "content": "In Python, the forward slash `/` in a function signature indicates that the parameters before the slash are positional-only parameters. This means that these parameters must be specified using positional arguments, and cannot be specified using keyword arguments.\n\nThe concept of positional-only parameters was introduced in Python 3.8, and the `/` is used to clearly distinguish parameters that can only be provided positionally, as opposed to those which can also be provided as keyword arguments.\n\nHere's an example to illustrate:\n\n```python\ndef example_func(a, b, /, c, d, *, e, f):\n    pass\n```\n\nIn this function:\n- `a` and `b` are positional-only parameters (must be passed positionally, before the `/`).\n- `c` and `d` can be passed either positionally or as keyword arguments.\n- `e` and `f` are keyword-only parameters (must be passed as keyword arguments, after the `*`).\n\nThis distinction is particularly useful in functions where the parameters should not be confused or overridden by keyword arguments, often for backward compatibility or to maintain clarity in function usage. In the context of built-in functions and methods, like those you mentioned (`object.__eq__`, `object.__init__`), this notation is used to indicate which parameters must be provided positionally."
