        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to `pygraphviz` requiring the Graphviz development libraries, which include `libcgraph`. This issue is common when these libraries are not installed or not found in the expected location. Here's how you can resolve it:\n\n1. **Install Graphviz Development Libraries:**\n\n   - **On macOS:** If you are using macOS, you can install Graphviz and its dependencies using Homebrew. First, make sure Homebrew is installed, then run:\n     ```bash\n     brew install graphviz\n     ```\n\n   - **On Ubuntu/Debian-based Systems:** Use the following command to install Graphviz and its development libraries:\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt-get update\n     sudo apt-get install graphviz graphviz-dev\n     ```\n\n   - **On Fedora:**\n     ```bash\n     sudo dnf install graphviz graphviz-devel\n     ```\n\n   - **On Windows:** You can download Graphviz from the official website and ensure it's added to your system's PATH.\n\n2. **Set the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` Environment Variable:**\n\n   Sometimes, even after installing the necessary packages, the installation script might not find the libraries. You can help it locate them by setting the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`:\n\n   - Find where `libcgraph.pc` is located. It is typically found in `/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/` or a similar directory.\n\n   - Set the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable to include this directory. For example:\n     ```bash\n     export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH\n     ```\n\n3. **Install `pygraphviz` Again:**\n\n   After ensuring that the Graphviz development libraries are installed and the path is set, try installing `pygraphviz` again:\n   ```bash\n   sudo pip install pygraphviz\n   ```\n\n4. **Use Sudo with `-H` Flag:**\n\n   If you see permission issues, try using sudo with the `-H` flag, which sets the home environment variable:\n   ```bash\n   sudo -H pip install pygraphviz\n   ```\n\nIf you continue to have issues, please check if the `pkg-config` tool is installed, as it helps locate the installed libraries. You can install it using:\n- **On Ubuntu/Debian:**\n  ```bash\n  sudo apt-get install pkg-config\n  ```\n\n- **On macOS (via Homebrew):**\n  ```bash\n  brew install pkg-config\n  ```\n\nAfter following these steps, the installation of `pygraphviz` should complete successfully."
