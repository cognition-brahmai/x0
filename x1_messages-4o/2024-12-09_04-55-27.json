For instance, calling 'add(1)' should return 1, and 'add(1)(2)' should return 3. However, I am not familiar with the concept of function chaining in Python where a function f(x) can be called as f(x)(y)(z) and so on. Can someone help me understand the concept and how to implement it in Python?"

        "content": "Certainly! The concept you're referring to is known as \"function chaining\" or \"currying\" in Python. This involves writing a function that returns another function, allowing you to chain calls together. In your case, you want a function `add` that can be called successively to accumulate a sum.\n\nHere's a simple way to implement such a function in Python:\n\n```python\nclass Add:\n    def __init__(self, value=0):\n        self.value = value\n\n    def __call__(self, num=0):\n        return Add(self.value + num)\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return str(self.value)\n\ndef add(num=0):\n    return Add(num)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Class `Add`:**\n   - We create a class `Add` that holds a `value` which represents the accumulated sum.\n   - The constructor `__init__` initializes this value.\n\n2. **Method `__call__`:**\n   - This special method is used to make an instance of the class callable like a function.\n   - It takes an additional number `num`, adds it to the current `value`, and returns a new `Add` instance with the updated sum.\n   - This allows chaining calls like `add(1)(2)`.\n\n3. **Method `__repr__`:**\n   - This is used to define the string representation of the object, so when you print the result, it shows the accumulated sum.\n\n4. **Function `add`:**\n   - This function creates an instance of the `Add` class with the initial number and starts the chain.\n\n### Usage:\n\n- When you call `add(1)`, it returns an `Add` instance with `value = 1`.\n- When you then call `(2)` on it, `__call__` is invoked, creating a new `Add` instance with `value = 3`.\n- You can continue chaining like this: `add(1)(2)(3)` to get `6`.\n\nThis design leverages Python's object-oriented features to achieve a functional-style chaining effect."
