        "content": "The issue you're encountering is because you're trying to directly read the content of a webpage that is not a direct link to the CSV file. When you access a file on GitHub through the URL you provided, you're actually getting the HTML content of the page, not the raw CSV file.\n\nTo fix this, you need to use the raw file URL from GitHub. Here's how you can modify your code to work correctly:\n\n1. Go to the GitHub page where the CSV file is located.\n2. Click on the \"Raw\" button to get the direct link to the CSV file.\n3. Use this direct link in your code.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport requests\nfrom io import StringIO\n\n# Use the raw URL of the CSV file\nurl = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cs109/2014_data/master/countries.csv\"\ns = requests.get(url).content\n\n# Use StringIO to convert bytes to a file-like object\nc = pd.read_csv(StringIO(s.decode('utf-8')))\n\n# Print the dataframe to verify\nprint(c)\n```\n\nIn this updated code:\n\n- We use the `StringIO` module to convert the bytes data into a file-like object that `pandas` can read.\n- The `s.decode('utf-8')` part is used to decode the byte content into a string.\n\nThis should resolve the error and allow you to successfully read the CSV file."
