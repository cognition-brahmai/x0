        "content": "To send a GET request to a specific URL and receive data in JSON format, you can use Python's built-in `requests` library. Once you have the JSON response, you can easily parse it into a Python dictionary using the `json()` method provided by the `requests` library. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n1. First, ensure you have the `requests` library installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\n2. Then, you can use the following Python code to send a GET request, receive a JSON response, and parse it into a dictionary:\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n\n   # Define the URL you want to send the GET request to\n   url = 'https://api.example.com/data'\n\n   # Send a GET request to the URL\n   response = requests.get(url)\n\n   # Check if the request was successful (status code 200)\n   if response.status_code == 200:\n       # Parse the JSON data into a Python dictionary\n       data = response.json()\n       # Print the dictionary\n       print(data)\n   else:\n       print(f\"Failed to retrieve data: {response.status_code}\")\n   ```\n\nIn this code:\n- We use `requests.get(url)` to send a GET request to the specified URL.\n- We check if the response status code is 200, indicating that the request was successful.\n- We use `response.json()` to parse the JSON response content into a Python dictionary.\n- Finally, we print the dictionary to view the data.\n\nMake sure to replace `'https://api.example.com/data'` with the actual URL you want to send the GET request to."
