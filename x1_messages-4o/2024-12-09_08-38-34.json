Here's a step-by-step guide using Python:\n\n```python\n# Open the file in read mode\nwith open(\"Stud.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    # Read the content of the file\n    content = file.read()\n\n# Replace all occurrences of \"A\" with \"Orange\"\ncontent = content.replace(\"A\", \"Orange\")\n\n# Open the file in write mode to save the changes\nwith open(\"Stud.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n    # Write the modified content back to the file\n    file.write(content)\n\nprint(\"All occurrences of 'A' have been replaced with 'Orange'.\")\n```\n\nHere's what the code does:\n\n1. **Open the File for Reading**: It opens \"Stud.txt\" in read mode and reads the entire content into a variable.\n2. **Replace the String**: It replaces all occurrences of \"A\" with \"Orange\" in the content.\n3. **Open the File for Writing**: It opens \"Stud.txt\" again, this time in write mode, and writes the modified content back to the file.\n4. **Confirmation**: Finally, it prints a confirmation message.\n\nMake sure that \"Stud.txt\" is in the same directory as your Python script, or provide the full path to the file. Also, ensure you have write permissions for the file."
