However, when I try \"pip -V\" or \"python3 -m pip\", it says that pip is not installed and there is no module named pip. When I try \"python -m ensurepip\" or \"python3 -m ensurepip\", it says there is no module named ensurepip. Is there something wrong with my Python 3.4 installation? I have read in multiple places that Python 3.4 should come with pip. Ultimately, I want to run Django 1.8 using Python 3.4.3."

        "content": "It seems like there's a bit of a setup issue with your Python 3.4 installation. While Python 3.4 was indeed the first version to include `ensurepip` for bootstrapping `pip`, sometimes the installation might not include it due to various reasons, such as the way Python was installed or specific configurations of your operating system.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can resolve this and get `pip` installed on your Lubuntu 14.04 system:\n\n### Option 1: Install `pip` using a package manager\n\n1. **Update your package index:**\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   ```\n\n2. **Install `python3-pip`:**\n\n   This package should install `pip` for Python 3.\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install python3-pip\n   ```\n\n### Option 2: Manual installation of `pip`\n\nIf the above method doesn't work, you can manually install `pip` using the following steps:\n\n1. **Download `get-pip.py`:**\n\n   You can download the `get-pip.py` script, which is a Python script to install `pip`.\n\n   ```bash\n   curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Run the script with Python 3.4:**\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 get-pip.py\n   ```\n\nThis should install `pip` for your Python 3.4 environment.\n\n### Verify the Installation\n\nOnce `pip` is installed, verify the installation by checking the version:\n\n```bash\npip3 -V\n```\n\n### Installing Django 1.8\n\nAfter ensuring that `pip` is installed, you can install Django 1.8 using the following command:\n\n```bash\npip3 install Django==1.8\n```\n\nThis should set up Django 1.8 for your Python 3.4 environment. Make sure to use `pip3` to ensure you're installing it for Python 3.x.\n\n### Additional Note\n\nIf you encounter any issues with SSL during the installation of packages, you may need to ensure that your system's SSL libraries are up-to-date, as older systems like Lubuntu 14.04 may have outdated SSL configurations.\n\nLet me know if you need further assistance!"
