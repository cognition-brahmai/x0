        "content": "To modify the existing MATLAB code to calculate and display the average duration of activities for each person on Jennifer's camping trip, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Total and Average Duration:**\n\n   You need to loop through each person and their activities, calculate the total duration for each person, and then compute the average duration by dividing the total duration by the number of activities.\n\n2. **Add Constraint for Difficulty Level and Duration:**\n\n   To find the activity with the highest difficulty level and a duration of at least 2 hours, you can iterate through the activities and apply the constraint before checking for the highest difficulty.\n\nHere is a sample MATLAB code that demonstrates these modifications:\n\n```matlab\n% Sample data structure\nparticipants = {\n    'Alice', {'Hiking', 3, 5; 'Swimming', 1.5, 3; 'Fishing', 2.5, 4};\n    'Bob', {'Hiking', 4, 4; 'Swimming', 2, 5; 'Fishing', 3, 3};\n    'Charlie', {'Hiking', 2, 2; 'Swimming', 1, 4; 'Fishing', 2, 5};\n};\n\n% Loop through each participant\nfor i = 1:size(participants, 1)\n    person = participants{i, 1};\n    activities = participants{i, 2};\n    \n    totalDuration = 0;\n    activityCount = size(activities, 1);\n    \n    % Calculate total duration\n    for j = 1:activityCount\n        totalDuration = totalDuration + activities{j, 2};\n    end\n    \n    % Calculate average duration\n    averageDuration = totalDuration / activityCount;\n    \n    % Display results\n    fprintf('Participant: %s\\n', person);\n    fprintf('Total Duration: %.2f hours\\n', totalDuration);\n    fprintf('Average Duration: %.2f hours\\n', averageDuration);\n    fprintf('\\n');\nend\n\n% Find the activity with the highest difficulty level and duration >= 2 hours\nhighestDifficulty = 0;\nselectedActivity = '';\nselectedDuration = 0;\n\nfor i = 1:size(participants, 1)\n    activities = participants{i, 2};\n    \n    for j = 1:size(activities, 1)\n        activityName = activities{j, 1};\n        duration = activities{j, 2};\n        difficulty = activities{j, 3};\n        \n        if duration >= 2 && difficulty > highestDifficulty\n            highestDifficulty = difficulty;\n            selectedActivity = activityName;\n            selectedDuration = duration;\n        end\n    end\nend\n\n% Display the activity with the highest difficulty level and duration >= 2 hours\nfprintf('Activity with the highest difficulty level and duration >= 2 hours:\\n');\nfprintf('Activity: %s\\n', selectedActivity);\nfprintf('Duration: %.2f hours\\n', selectedDuration);\nfprintf('Difficulty Level: %d\\n', highestDifficulty);\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Total and Average Duration:** The code calculates the total duration of activities for each participant and divides it by the number of activities to get the average duration.\n- **Constraint on Duration:** The code checks if the duration is at least 2 hours before considering the difficulty level to find the activity with the highest difficulty.\n\nThis solution assumes the data is structured as a cell array where each row represents a participant and their respective activities, along with the duration and difficulty level. Adjust the data structure as needed to fit your exact requirements."
