I have the following python code snippets:\n\nFirst code snippet:\n```python\nx = 1\nclass Foo:\n    x = 2\n    def foo():\n        x = 3\n        class Foo:\n            print(x) # prints 3\nFoo.foo()\n```\nSecond code snippet:\n```python\nx = 1\nclass Foo:\n    x = 2\n    def foo():\n        x = 3\n        class Foo:\n            x += 10\n            print(x) # prints 11\nFoo.foo()\n```\nThird code snippet:\n```python\nx = 1\nclass Foo:\n    x = 2\n    def foo():\n        x = 3\n        class Foo:\n            print(x) # prints 1\n            x += 10\nFoo.foo()\n```\nI would like to understand why the results are different for each code snippet. From the LEGB (Local, Enclosed, Global, Built-in) scoping rule, I would expect that all the snippets print 3, 13, and 3, since there is an 'x' defined in the enclosing function 'foo()'. Could you explain how scoping in Python works with classes?"

        "content": "In Python, the scoping rules follow the LEGB (Local, Enclosed, Global, Built-in) order, but when it comes to classes, there are some nuances to be aware of. Let's go through each code snippet to understand the behavior.\n\n### First Code Snippet\n```python\nx = 1\nclass Foo:\n    x = 2\n    def foo():\n        x = 3\n        class Foo:\n            print(x) # prints 3\nFoo.foo()\n```\nIn this snippet, the `print(x)` inside the inner class `Foo` looks for `x` following the LEGB rules. Here, `x = 3` is defined in the local scope of the function `foo()`, which is an enclosing scope for the inner class `Foo`. Hence, it prints `3`.\n\n### Second Code Snippet\n```python\nx = 1\nclass Foo:\n    x = 2\n    def foo():\n        x = 3\n        class Foo:\n            x += 10\n            print(x) # prints 11\nFoo.foo()\n```\nThis snippet attempts to modify `x` using the augmented assignment `x += 10`. However, the statement `x += 10` implies that `x` is being modified, which requires it to be classified as a local variable. Since `x` is not defined within the local scope of the inner class `Foo`, Python looks for `x` in the enclosing function `foo()`. The `x` in `foo()` is `3`, so `3 + 10` results in `11`. Here, the Python interpreter allows this modification due to an implicit search and modification in the enclosing scope, which is typically not the case unless explicitly declared as `nonlocal`.\n\n### Third Code Snippet\n```python\nx = 1\nclass Foo:\n    x = 2\n    def foo():\n        x = 3\n        class Foo:\n            print(x) # prints 1\n            x += 10\nFoo.foo()\n```\nIn this snippet, when `print(x)` is executed, Python initially attempts to resolve `x` according to the LEGB rule. However, since `x += 10` is present, Python treats `x` as a local variable for the inner class `Foo`, shadowing any `x` from the enclosing scope. But since `x` is not initialized within the inner class `Foo`, Python resorts to the global scope where `x = 1`. This is why `1` is printed before attempting the `x += 10` operation, which would normally result in an UnboundLocalError if executed because `x` is considered local but not yet initialized within the inner class scope.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhen dealing with classes in Python, especially nested ones, it's important to understand how variable scope resolution works together with assignments:\n- Assignments and augmented assignments (`+=`, `-=`, etc.) in a block automatically treat the variable as local unless declared otherwise using `nonlocal` or `global`.\n- If the variable is not found in the local scope, Python looks in the enclosing, then global, and finally built-in scopes, following the LEGB rule.\n- In the presence of a class definition, its scope can introduce additional complexity since it doesn't behave like a typical function scope.\n\nUnderstanding these rules helps avoid confusion when working with nested structures and scoping in Python."
