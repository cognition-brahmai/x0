        "content": "In Python, the most widely accepted way to add comments to functions is by using docstrings. Docstrings provide a convenient way of associating documentation with functions, classes, methods, or modules. They are placed as the first statement within the function body and are typically written in triple quotes (`\"\"\"` or `'''`). Here\u2019s how you can use a docstring to document a function:\n\n```python\ndef add(self):\n    \"\"\"\n    Create a new user.\n\n    This function is responsible for adding a new user to the system.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Function implementation goes here\n```\n\nUsing docstrings is beneficial because they:\n\n1. Are accessible via the `__doc__` attribute of the function.\n2. Can be used by tools like Sphinx to automatically generate documentation.\n3. Are considered part of the official Python style guide, PEP 8.\n\nYour current method of using multiple `#` symbols to create a block comment is not incorrect, but it is not the standard practice for documenting functions in Python. Comments like those are typically used for inline comments or to briefly explain non-obvious parts of the code within the function body. For function-level documentation, it's best to use docstrings."
