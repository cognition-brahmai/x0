        "content": "Creating a fully-fledged grammar correction program in Java is quite complex, as it typically involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques. However, I can guide you through a simple example using a basic approach that might correct some common grammatical errors. Note that for advanced grammar checking, you would typically integrate with a third-party library or service, such as LanguageTool.\n\nHere's a basic Java program that uses simple string replacement logic to correct specific grammatical errors:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class GrammarCorrector {\n\n    public static String correctGrammar(String sentence) {\n        // Basic corrections using string replacement\n        sentence = sentence.replaceAll(\"\\\\bI am go\\\\b\", \"I am going\");\n        sentence = sentence.replaceAll(\"\\\\bI am watch\\\\b\", \"I am watching\");\n        sentence = sentence.replaceAll(\"\\\\bI am eat\\\\b\", \"I am eating\");\n        // Add more patterns as needed\n\n        return sentence;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        System.out.println(\"Enter a sentence to correct:\");\n        String inputSentence = scanner.nextLine();\n\n        String correctedSentence = correctGrammar(inputSentence);\n        System.out.println(\"Corrected Sentence: \" + correctedSentence);\n\n        // Example correction\n        String exampleSentence = \"I am go to watch a movie\";\n        String correctedExample = correctGrammar(exampleSentence);\n        System.out.println(\"Example Correction: \" + correctedExample);\n\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **String Replacement**: The program uses simple regular expressions with `replaceAll()` to match and replace specific patterns with corrected grammar.\n\n2. **Input and Output**: It takes a sentence as input from the user and outputs the corrected sentence.\n\n3. **Example**: The program also includes an example correction for the sentence \"I am go to watch a movie\".\n\nThis approach is rudimentary and won't cover all grammar rules, but it can serve as a starting point. For more comprehensive correction, consider using NLP libraries like Apache OpenNLP, Stanford NLP, or integrating with external services like LanguageTool."
