        "content": "In the context of language modeling using PyTorch, I came across a piece of code where the hidden weights are being initialized before every new epoch of training. I am a bit confused as to why we need to initialize the hidden weights each time. Shouldn't the model inherit the hidden parameters from the last epoch and continue training on them? Here is the code in question:\n\nFor the training part:\n```python\nprint(\"Training and generating...\")\nfor epoch in range(1, config.num_epochs + 1): \n    total_loss = 0.0\n    model.train()  \n    hidden = model.init_hidden(config.batch_size)  \n\n    for ibatch, i in enumerate(range(0, train_len - 1, seq_len)):\n        data, targets = get_batch(train_data, i, seq_len)          \n        hidden = repackage_hidden(hidden)\n        model.zero_grad()\n\n        output, hidden = model(data, hidden)\n        loss = criterion(output.view(-1, config.vocab_size), targets)\n        loss.backward()  \n```\nAnd for the `init_hidden` function:\n```python\ndef init_hidden(self, bsz):\n    weight = next(self.parameters()).data\n    if self.rnn_type == 'LSTM':  # lstm\uff1a(h0, c0)\n        return (Variable(weight.new(self.n_layers, bsz, self.hi_dim).zero_()),\n                Variable(weight.new(self.n_layers, bsz, self.hi_dim).zero_()))\n    else:  # gru & rnn\uff1ah0\n        return Variable(weight.new(self.n_layers, bsz, self.hi_dim).zero_())\n```\nIn the training code, hidden weights are being initialized on line 5. Why is this necessary?"

        "content": "In the context of training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) like LSTMs or GRUs, the hidden states are typically reset at the beginning of each epoch or each sequence. This practice is crucial for a few reasons:\n\n1. **Sequence Independence**: Each training sequence is often treated as independent in many training setups. By resetting the hidden states at the start of each sequence, you ensure that the learning of one sequence does not inadvertently interfere with another. This is especially important if your sequences are not related or if they're shuffled during training.\n\n2. **Gradient Flow**: RNNs suffer from issues like vanishing and exploding gradients, especially over long sequences. By resetting the hidden states, you essentially limit the backpropagation through time to the length of your sequence, which helps mitigate these issues.\n\n3. **Batch Processing**: When processing batches of sequences, each sequence in a batch may have different starting points in the data. Resetting the hidden states ensures that each sequence is processed independently, which is often desirable depending on your dataset and task.\n\n4. **Overfitting Prevention**: Carrying state from one sequence to another can sometimes lead to overfitting, especially if the sequences are not related. Resetting helps in regularizing the model.\n\n5. **Alignment with Data**: If your data is not continuous (e.g., shuffled batches of sentences), resetting the hidden state aligns the model's assumptions with the nature of your data.\n\nIn your code, the `init_hidden` function is used to initialize the hidden states to zeroes at the start of each epoch. This ensures that each pass through the data starts with a clean slate, in terms of hidden state, allowing the model to learn from each sequence independently.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that if your sequences are indeed parts of a continuous stream of data (like time series), you might want to carry over the hidden states between batches within an epoch, but this is a specific use case and should be aligned with your data and modeling goals. The `repackage_hidden` function mentioned in your code snippet seems to help with detaching hidden states from their history across batches, which further supports this style of training."
