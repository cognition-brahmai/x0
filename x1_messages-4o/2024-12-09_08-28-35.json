I have a class 'clippy_runner' and in the `__enter__` method, I'm initializing an ExcelConnection with a filename and a SQLConnection with a param_dict. Here is my existing code:\n\n```python\nclass clippy_runner:\n    def __enter__(self):\n        self.engine = ExcelConnection(filename = \"clippytest\\Test.xlsx\")\n        self.db = SQLConnection(param_dict = DATASOURCES[STAGE_RELATIONAL])\n\n        self.engine.connect()\n        self.db.connect()\n\n        return self\n```\n\nI'd like to pass 'filename' and 'param_dict' as parameters to `__enter__`. Is it possible to do that?"

        "content": "In Python, the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods of a context manager (which is what the `with` statement uses) don't directly accept arguments. However, you can achieve the desired functionality by modifying the class constructor to accept parameters and then use those parameters in the `__enter__` method. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nclass clippy_runner:\n    def __init__(self, filename, param_dict):\n        self.filename = filename\n        self.param_dict = param_dict\n\n    def __enter__(self):\n        self.engine = ExcelConnection(filename=self.filename)\n        self.db = SQLConnection(param_dict=self.param_dict)\n\n        self.engine.connect()\n        self.db.connect()\n\n        return self\n\n    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):\n        self.engine.disconnect()\n        self.db.disconnect()\n\n# Usage\nwith clippy_runner(filename=\"clippytest\\Test.xlsx\", param_dict=DATASOURCES[STAGE_RELATIONAL]) as runner:\n    # Your code that uses runner.engine and runner.db\n```\n\nIn this setup:\n- The `__init__` method is used to initialize the `clippy_runner` instance with the necessary parameters (`filename` and `param_dict`).\n- These parameters are stored as instance variables and then used in the `__enter__` method to initialize `ExcelConnection` and `SQLConnection`.\n- The `with` statement then uses this context manager to ensure proper setup and teardown of resources."
