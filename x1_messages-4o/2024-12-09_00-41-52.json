I am already familiar with Python's special methods like `__div__`, `__truediv__`, `__floordiv__`, and use them to divide instances of classes by numbers or instances of other classes, but I'm struggling to find a way to divide a number by an instance of my class. Is this achievable in Python?"

        "content": "Yes, it is indeed achievable to divide a number by an instance of your class in Python, and you can accomplish this by implementing the `__rtruediv__` special method in your class. The `__rtruediv__` method is the right-hand version of the division operation. It is called when the left operand does not support the division operation with the right operand, or the left operand's division method returns `NotImplemented`.\n\nHere's how you could implement it:\n\n```python\nclass Time:\n    def __init__(self, seconds):\n        self.seconds = seconds\n\n    def __rtruediv__(self, other):\n        # Assuming 'other' is a number (either int or float)\n        if isinstance(other, (int, float)):\n            # Create an instance of Frequency\n            return Frequency(other / self.seconds)\n        return NotImplemented\n\nclass Frequency:\n    def __init__(self, hertz):\n        self.hertz = hertz\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"Frequency({self.hertz} Hz)\"\n\n# Example usage:\ntime_instance = Time(5)\nfrequency_instance = 10 / time_instance\nprint(frequency_instance)  # Output: Frequency(2.0 Hz)\n```\n\nIn this example, when you attempt to divide a number by an instance of `Time`, the `__rtruediv__` method is called, allowing you to define the behavior of the division operation in this specific context. The method checks if the left operand is a number and then performs the division, returning an instance of the `Frequency` class."
