Calculate the discount amount:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discount Amount} = \\text{Original Price} \\times \\frac{\\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} = 100 \\times \\frac{25}{100} = 25\n   \\]\n\n2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the final price:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final Price} = \\text{Original Price} - \\text{Discount Amount} = 100 - 25 = 75\n   \\]\n\nSo, the final price after applying a 25% discount is $75."
