        "content": "In MATLAB, to multiply two arrays element-wise, you use the `.*` operator. However, since both arrays you mentioned contain only one element, it's a straightforward multiplication. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```matlab\narray1 = [3];\narray2 = [6];\nresult = array1 .* array2;\n```\n\nThis code will multiply the single element in `array1` by the single element in `array2`, resulting in `result` being `[18]`. If you want to multiply arrays with more elements, ensure they are of the same size for element-wise multiplication."
