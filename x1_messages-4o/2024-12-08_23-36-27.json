This function replaces occurrences of a specified substring within a string with another substring. Here's how you can do it:\n\nAssuming your sentence \"It is raining cats and dogs.\" is in column A, starting from cell A1, you can use the following formula in cell B1 (or any other column where you want the corrected sentence to appear):\n\n```excel\n=SUBSTITUTE(A1, \"cats and dogs\", \"cats, and dogs\")\n```\n\nThis formula will replace \"cats and dogs\" with \"cats, and dogs\" in the text from cell A1. You can then drag the formula down to apply it to other cells in column A."
