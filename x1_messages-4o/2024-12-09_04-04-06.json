This border seems to share properties with the lines that create the hatching, making it impossible for me to set the edge color to \"none\" or set the linestyle as \"--\" without affecting the hatching. Below is my current code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot([0,1],[0,1],ls=\"--\",c=\"b\")\nplt.fill_between([0,1],[0,1],color=\"none\",hatch=\"X\",edgecolor=\"b\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThe resulting plot image is:\n\n![Plot Image](https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Kr0q.png)\n\nIn this plot, I want the diagonal line from 0,0 to 1,1 to be dashed. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired effect of having a hatched region without a border, while maintaining a dashed line over the region, you can use a combination of the `fill_between` function for the hatching and the `plot` function for the dashed line. Here\u2019s how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Plot the dashed line\nplt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], ls=\"--\", c=\"b\")\n\n# Fill the area with hatching, and set edgecolor to 'none' to avoid the border\nplt.fill_between([0, 1], [0, 1], color=\"none\", hatch=\"X\", edgecolor=\"none\")\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Dashed Line**: The `plot` function is used to draw the dashed line with `ls=\"--\"` and color `c=\"b\"`.\n- **Hatched Region**: The `fill_between` function is used to create the hatched region. By setting `edgecolor=\"none\"`, you avoid drawing a border around the hatched region.\n- **No Border on Hatched Region**: Since you want no border around the hatched area, using `edgecolor=\"none\"` ensures that only the hatching lines appear without any additional border lines.\n\nThis way, you maintain the dashed line from (0,0) to (1,1) while having a clean hatched fill underneath without interfering borders."
