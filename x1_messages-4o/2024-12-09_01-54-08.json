For instance, in the following code where I have created 'ticker' methods for the 'UselessExample' class, it is relatively simple to maintain both. However, with the addition of exception handling and more complex functionalities, maintaining both methods could potentially become a challenge. If there is no significant difference that justifies having both fully implemented, what is the most efficient and Pythonic way to manage a class like this and avoid unnecessary duplication?\n\n```python\nfrom time import sleep\nimport asyncio\n\nclass UselessExample:\n    def __init__(self, delay):\n        self.delay = delay\n\n    async def a_ticker(self, to):\n        for i in range(to):\n            yield i\n            await asyncio.sleep(self.delay)\n\n    def ticker(self, to):\n        for i in range(to):\n            yield i\n            sleep(self.delay)\n\ndef func(ue):\n    for value in ue.ticker(5):\n        print(value)\n\nasync def a_func(ue):\n    async for value in ue.a_ticker(5):\n        print(value)\n\ndef main():\n    ue = UselessExample(1)\n    func(ue)\n    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n    loop.run_until_complete(a_func(ue))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```"

        "content": "To manage a class like this and avoid unnecessary duplication between synchronous and asynchronous methods, you can use a strategy to abstract common functionalities and separate the synchronization concerns. One approach is to create a common generator method that handles the core logic and then wrap it with either synchronous or asynchronous behavior as needed. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom time import sleep\nimport asyncio\n\nclass UselessExample:\n    def __init__(self, delay):\n        self.delay = delay\n\n    def _base_ticker(self, to):\n        \"\"\"Core generator logic that yields values.\"\"\"\n        for i in range(to):\n            yield i\n\n    async def a_ticker(self, to):\n        \"\"\"Asynchronous wrapper for the base ticker.\"\"\"\n        for i in self._base_ticker(to):\n            yield i\n            await asyncio.sleep(self.delay)\n\n    def ticker(self, to):\n        \"\"\"Synchronous wrapper for the base ticker.\"\"\"\n        for i in self._base_ticker(to):\n            yield i\n            sleep(self.delay)\n\ndef func(ue):\n    for value in ue.ticker(5):\n        print(value)\n\nasync def a_func(ue):\n    async for value in ue.a_ticker(5):\n        print(value)\n\ndef main():\n    ue = UselessExample(1)\n    func(ue)\n    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n    loop.run_until_complete(a_func(ue))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Common Logic**: The `_base_ticker` method encapsulates the core logic of generating values. This method doesn't deal with any `sleep` functionality, making it reusable in both synchronous and asynchronous contexts.\n\n2. **Synchronous Wrapper**: The `ticker` method wraps the `_base_ticker` method and adds synchronous delay using `sleep`.\n\n3. **Asynchronous Wrapper**: The `a_ticker` method wraps the `_base_ticker` method and adds asynchronous delay using `await asyncio.sleep`.\n\nBy organizing your code this way, you minimize duplication and maintain a clear separation of concerns between the core logic and the synchronization aspect. This approach is both efficient and Pythonic, making it easier to maintain and extend."
