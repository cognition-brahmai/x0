        "content": "The maximum speed limit for residential areas can vary significantly depending on local laws and regulations. Generally, in many parts of the world, the speed limit for residential areas is set around 25 to 30 km/h (15 to 20 mph) to enhance safety, especially in areas with older populations and a history of pedestrian accidents. However, you should check with local traffic authorities for precise information specific to your city.\n\nHere's a hypothetical table comparing speed limits in residential areas of five cities with similar demographics:\n\n| City            | Population | Average Age | Reported Incidents | Speed Limit (km/h) | Pedestrian Traffic Level |\n|-----------------|------------|-------------|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|\n| City A          | 1.2 million| 62          | 4                  | 30                | Low                      |\n| City B          | 1.5 million| 65          | 5                  | 25                | High                     |\n| City C          | 1.1 million| 63          | 3                  | 30                | Medium                   |\n| City D          | 1.3 million| 60          | 6                  | 20                | High                     |\n| City E          | 1.6 million| 61          | 7                  | 25                | Medium                   |\n\nThis table is illustrative and should not be used as official data.\n\nFor the SQL query, assuming you have a database with tables for vehicle speeds and locations, here's an example query that could help you retrieve the average speed of vehicles in residential areas within a 5-mile radius of the city center during rush hour:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(speed) AS average_speed\nFROM vehicle_data\nWHERE area_type = 'residential'\n  AND ST_Distance(location, ST_MakePoint(city_center_longitude, city_center_latitude)) <= 5\n  AND time_of_day BETWEEN '07:00:00' AND '09:00:00'\n  OR time_of_day BETWEEN '17:00:00' AND '19:00:00';\n```\n\nIn this query:\n- `vehicle_data` is the table containing vehicle speed information.\n- `area_type` is a column indicating whether the area is residential.\n- `location` is a spatial data column storing the geographic location of the vehicle.\n- `ST_Distance` is a spatial function to calculate distance from the city center.\n- `ST_MakePoint` is used to specify the city center's coordinates.\n- `time_of_day` filters records for rush hour times. Adjust this as needed for your specific data schema and database system."
