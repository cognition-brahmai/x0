This works perfectly when I print an empty line in between function calls. However, when I add an empty print line at the end of my `happyBirthday()` function, I encounter an indentation error. All works fine though when I do not include the additional print line. Can you suggest why this might be happening? Here is the code I am working with:\n\n```python\ndef happyBirthday(person):\n    print(\"Happy Birthday to you!\")\n    print(\"Happy Birthday to you!\")\n    print(\"Happy Birthday, dear \" + person + \".\")\n    print(\"Happy Birthday to you!\")\n    print(\"\\n\") #error line\n\nhappyBirthday('Emily')\nhappyBirthday('Andre')\nhappyBirthday('Maria')\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely due to an indentation error in your code. In Python, proper indentation is critical as it defines the blocks of code. The error might be caused by inconsistent use of spaces or tabs for indentation. Here's how you can resolve this:\n\n1. Ensure that the indentation is consistent throughout your script. In Python, it's common to use 4 spaces for indentation. Avoid mixing spaces and tabs.\n\n2. Make sure that the `print(\"\\n\")` line is indented correctly, just like the other `print` statements within the `happyBirthday()` function.\n\nHere's a corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\ndef happyBirthday(person):\n    print(\"Happy Birthday to you!\")\n    print(\"Happy Birthday to you!\")\n    print(\"Happy Birthday, dear \" + person + \".\")\n    print(\"Happy Birthday to you!\")\n    print()  # This line should be properly indented like the others\n\nhappyBirthday('Emily')\nhappyBirthday('Andre')\nhappyBirthday('Maria')\n```\n\nIn this code, I've replaced `print(\"\\n\")` with `print()`, which achieves the same result by printing a blank line. Ensure all lines within the function have the same indentation. If you're using an IDE or text editor, you can often configure it to automatically use spaces for indentation, which can help prevent these types of errors."
