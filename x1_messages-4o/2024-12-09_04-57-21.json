After running my model for 100 epochs, I observed that the cost decreases after each epoch, which indicates that the network is functioning correctly. However, the accuracy is consistently 1.0 every time, which is confusing me as I just started learning about neural networks. Also, when I checked the predictions matrix after each epoch, I found that it contained only zeros. Can someone help me understand why this is happening?"

        "content": "It sounds like you've encountered a situation where your model is achieving perfect accuracy, but the predictions are not what you expect. Here are a few things to consider and check:\n\n1. **Imbalanced Dataset**: Your dataset might be imbalanced, meaning one class is significantly more frequent than the other. If the model always predicts the majority class, it might achieve high accuracy without actually learning meaningful patterns. To diagnose this, check the distribution of your labels. If it's imbalanced, consider using techniques like resampling, generating synthetic samples (e.g., using SMOTE), or using class weights during training.\n\n2. **Loss Function and Output Activation**: Ensure that the loss function and output layer activation are appropriate for binary classification. Typically, for binary classification, you would use a sigmoid activation function in the output layer and binary cross-entropy as the loss function.\n\n3. **Learning Rate**: If the learning rate is too high, the model might converge too quickly to a poor solution. Try reducing the learning rate and observe if there's any change.\n\n4. **Model Complexity**: If your model is too simple (e.g., lacks sufficient layers/neurons), it might not learn the patterns in the data. Conversely, if it's too complex, it might overfit. Experiment with different architectures to see if it affects the results.\n\n5. **Data Preprocessing**: Ensure that your input features are properly normalized or standardized. This can significantly impact the performance of neural networks.\n\n6. **Initialization**: Check the initialization of your model's weights. Poor initialization can sometimes lead to suboptimal solutions.\n\n7. **Debugging Steps**: \n   - Print the first few predictions and their corresponding labels to see if there's any pattern.\n   - Use a smaller subset of the data to manually verify predictions.\n   - Visualize the loss and accuracy over epochs to ensure they are behaving as expected.\n\n8. **Threshold for Binary Classification**: By default, predictions are converted to class labels using a threshold (usually 0.5). Check if adjusting this threshold changes the outcome.\n\n9. **Check Data Flow**: Ensure that the data flow through your network is correct, i.e., inputs are properly fed, and outputs are correctly interpreted.\n\nIf you've gone through these checks and the issue persists, try simplifying the problem or model and gradually increase complexity, observing how each change impacts the results."
