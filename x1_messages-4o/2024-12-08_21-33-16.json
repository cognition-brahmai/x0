Here's how you can do it for the value \"3.14\":\n\n1. Suppose your value \"3.14\" is in cell A1.\n2. In another cell, enter the formula: `=VALUE(A1)`\n\nThis formula will convert the text string \"3.14\" into the numerical value 3.14 as a floating-point number.\n\nIf you have a whole column of values that you need to convert, you can apply the `VALUE` function to each cell in the column. For example, if your values are in column A, starting from A1, you can enter the formula `=VALUE(A1)` in the first cell of the adjacent column (e.g., B1) and then drag the fill handle down to apply it to the rest of the cells in the column. This will convert all text values in column A to numbers in column B."
