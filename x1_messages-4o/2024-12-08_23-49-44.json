The data shows:\n\n- January: $45\n- February: $50\n- March: $55\n\nFrom January to February, the price increased by $5. Similarly, from February to March, the price increased by $5. This suggests a linear trend where the price increases by $5 each month.\n\nBased on this pattern, we can predict that the price for April will be:\n\nMarch price + $5 = $55 + $5 = $60\n\nTherefore, the predicted price for April is $60."
