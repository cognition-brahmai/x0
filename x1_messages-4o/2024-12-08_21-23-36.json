This will ensure that the flavors are evenly distributed throughout the omelette.\n\n2. **Cook the Green Peppers:**\n   - Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the diced green pepper to the skillet and saut\u00e9 for about 2-3 minutes, or until they become slightly softened. This will add a nice crunch and a subtle flavor contrast to your omelette.\n\n3. **Cook the Omelette:**\n   - Pour the egg mixture into the skillet over the softened green peppers. Allow the mixture to cook for about 1-2 minutes, or until the bottom starts to set. You want the bottom to be firm enough to fold, but the top should still be slightly runny.\n\n4. **Fold the Omelette:**\n   - Using a spatula, gently fold the omelette in half. This helps to create the classic fluffy texture. Continue to cook for another 1-2 minutes, or until the eggs are fully cooked and the omelette is heated through.\n\n5. **Serve:**\n   - Serve the omelette hot. You can add additional soy sauce or garnish with toppings like chopped scallions, sesame seeds, or a drizzle of ketchup for added flavor.\n\n**Note:**\n- If you're looking for substitutions, replace mirin with a mixture of sugar and rice vinegar for sweetness, and use chicken or vegetable broth if dashi powder is unavailable. These alternatives will still provide a delightful taste profile.\n\nEnjoy your fluffy, slightly sweet, and savory Japanese-style omelette!"
