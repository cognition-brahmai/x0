        "content": "The error you're encountering is likely due to a few potential issues related to the environment and package versions. Here are some steps you can take to resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Update your Python Environment:**\n   - Make sure you're using a compatible version of Python. It's recommended to use Python 3.x, as Python 2.7 is outdated and no longer supported.\n\n2. **Install or Update Scikit-learn and Scipy:**\n   - Ensure that both `scikit-learn` and `scipy` are installed and up-to-date. You can update them using `pip`:\n     ```bash\n     pip install --upgrade scikit-learn scipy\n     ```\n\n3. **Check Your Scikit-learn Import Statements:**\n   - The module `cross_validation` has been deprecated in recent versions of scikit-learn. You should use `model_selection` instead:\n     ```python\n     from sklearn import preprocessing, svm\n     from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n     from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n     ```\n\n4. **Reinstall Scikit-learn and Scipy:**\n   - If updating doesn't work, try uninstalling and reinstalling `scikit-learn` and `scipy`:\n     ```bash\n     pip uninstall scikit-learn scipy\n     pip install scikit-learn scipy\n     ```\n\n5. **Check for Environment Issues:**\n   - Ensure you are using a consistent environment. If you are using Anaconda, consider creating a new environment:\n     ```bash\n     conda create --name myenv python=3.8\n     conda activate myenv\n     conda install scikit-learn scipy\n     ```\n\n6. **Verify DLL Dependencies:**\n   - The specific error `DLL load failed` suggests a missing DLL dependency. Ensure that your system's PATH includes directories for your Python installation and its scripts, as sometimes missing DLLs are due to PATH issues.\n\n7. **Check for Conflicting Packages:**\n   - Conflicting packages might cause issues. Use `pip list` to check for installed packages and their versions, and ensure there are no conflicts.\n\n8. **Check for System Updates:**\n   - Ensure your operating system and Python environment are updated, as missing system libraries can sometimes cause such issues.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the DLL load failure and proceed with your project. If issues persist, consider providing more specific information about your environment for further troubleshooting."
