I am trying to organize some modules and I want to define some classes in `lib/__init__.py` to be used when I import lib. However, I am not able to figure out how this can be done without separating the classes into different files and then importing them into `__init__.py`. Is it possible to define the class in `__init__.py` directly? If yes, how can I access the Helper class from `settings.py`?"

        "content": "Yes, you can define classes directly in the `__init__.py` file and then import them when you import the package. The `__init__.py` file is essentially used to initialize a Python package and can include code to define classes, functions, or import statements for submodules. \n\nHere's how you can achieve this:\n\nSuppose you have the following directory structure:\n\n```\nlib/\n    __init__.py\nsettings.py\n```\n\n1. **Define the Class in `__init__.py`:**\n\nIn your `lib/__init__.py` file, you can define a class, for example, `Helper`:\n\n```python\n# lib/__init__.py\n\nclass Helper:\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.value = value\n\n    def display(self):\n        print(f'The value is: {self.value}')\n```\n\n2. **Access the Class from `settings.py`:**\n\nIn your `settings.py` file, you can import the `Helper` class from the `lib` package like this:\n\n```python\n# settings.py\n\nfrom lib import Helper\n\nhelper_instance = Helper(42)\nhelper_instance.display()  # Outputs: The value is: 42\n```\n\nBy doing this, when you import the `lib` package, Python will execute the code in `lib/__init__.py`, making the `Helper` class available to code that imports the package. This setup allows you to organize your code within the `lib` package, and keep the `Helper` class directly in the `__init__.py` file if you prefer not to separate it into a different module."
