Here's how you can do it with your given DataFrame:\n\nFirst, you'll need to create your DataFrame. Then, you can add the new column 'Name' with the desired constant value 'abc'.\n\nHere's how you can accomplish this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Creating the initial DataFrame\ndata = {'Date': ['01-01-2015'],\n        'Open': [565],\n        'High': [600],\n        'Low': [400],\n        'Close': [450]}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Adding a new column 'Name' with a constant value 'abc'\ndf['Name'] = 'abc'\n\n# Reorder the columns to have 'Name' as the first column\ndf = df[['Name', 'Date', 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close']]\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThis will give you the DataFrame with the new column 'Name' added, and it will have 'abc' as the value for all rows. The columns are also rearranged to have 'Name' as the first column."
