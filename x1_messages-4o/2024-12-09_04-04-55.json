For instance, I want to open the site \"http://chess-problems.prg\" with this specific cookie. Below is the code that I am currently working with:\n\n```python\nimport urllib2\n# need to add cookie to the request somehow\nurllib2.urlopen(\"http://chess-problems.prg\")\n```"

        "content": "To send a specific cookie using `urllib2` in Python, you'll need to make use of the `HTTPCookieProcessor` and `CookieJar` to manage cookies. Here's how you can modify your code to include a specific cookie in your request:\n\n```python\nimport urllib2\nimport cookielib\n\n# Create a CookieJar object to hold the cookies\ncookie_jar = cookielib.CookieJar()\n\n# Create an opener with support for cookies\nopener = urllib2.build_opener(urllib2.HTTPCookieProcessor(cookie_jar))\n\n# Create a request object\nurl = \"http://chess-problems.prg\"\nrequest = urllib2.Request(url)\n\n# Add the specific cookie to the request\ncookie = \"search=1\"\nrequest.add_header(\"Cookie\", cookie)\n\n# Open the URL with the opener\nresponse = opener.open(request)\n\n# Read the response\ncontent = response.read()\n\n# Print the content\nprint(content)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **CookieJar**: This is a container to hold the cookies for your session.\n2. **HTTPCookieProcessor**: This processor automatically handles cookies for HTTP requests.\n3. **Opener**: You build an opener with the cookie processor to handle cookies during requests.\n4. **Request**: You create a request object where you can manually add headers, like the cookie header.\n5. **Adding Cookie**: The `add_header` method is used to add the \"Cookie\" header to the request.\n\nThis setup will send the specified cookie \"search=1\" along with your request to \"http://chess-problems.prg\"."
