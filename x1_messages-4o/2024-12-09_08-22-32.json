PEP 257 gives an example of using docstrings to describe the parameters, but I'm looking for a more formal structure. Would it be more conventional to use the \"@param\" syntax or the \"Keyword arguments\" syntax?\n\nExample with the \"Keyword argument\" syntax:\n```python\ndef complex(real=0.0, imag=0.0):\n    \"\"\"Form a complex number.\n\n    Keyword arguments:\n    real -- the real part (default 0.0)\n    imag -- the imaginary part (default 0.0)\n\n    \"\"\"\n    if imag == 0.0 and real == 0.0: return complex_zero\n    ...\n```\n\nExample with \"@param\" syntax:\n```python\ndef complex(real=0.0, imag=0.0):\n    \"\"\"Form a complex number.\n\n    @param: real The real part (default 0.0)\n    @param: imag The imaginary part (default 0.0)\n\n    \"\"\"\n    if imag == 0.0 and real == 0.0: return complex_zero\n    ...\n```"

        "content": "When it comes to documenting methods with parameters in Python, especially in an older version like Python 2.7.1, the choice between using a \"Keyword arguments\" style or \"@param\" style comes down to personal preference and the conventions used in your project or organization.\n\n1. **Keyword Arguments Style**: This is more aligned with the traditional Python community style as suggested in PEP 257. It's clear and straightforward, and it directly ties the explanation to the parameters within the context of Python's syntax.\n\n    ```python\n    def complex(real=0.0, imag=0.0):\n        \"\"\"Form a complex number.\n\n        Keyword arguments:\n        real -- the real part (default 0.0)\n        imag -- the imaginary part (default 0.0)\n\n        \"\"\"\n        if imag == 0.0 and real == 0.0: return complex_zero\n        ...\n    ```\n\n2. **@param Syntax**: This style is inspired by Javadoc and is used in some Python projects. It can be beneficial if you're transitioning from a Java environment or using tools that parse docstrings in this format. However, it\u2019s less common in pure Python projects.\n\n    ```python\n    def complex(real=0.0, imag=0.0):\n        \"\"\"Form a complex number.\n\n        @param real: The real part (default 0.0)\n        @param imag: The imaginary part (default 0.0)\n\n        \"\"\"\n        if imag == 0.0 and real == 0.0: return complex_zero\n        ...\n    ```\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Consistency**: Whatever style you choose, be consistent throughout your project. This helps with readability and maintainability.\n  \n- **Tooling**: Consider the tools you use for documentation generation. Some tools like Sphinx can support both styles, but you may need to configure them accordingly.\n\n- **Audience**: Think about the end-users of your documentation. If your team is already accustomed to a specific style, it may make sense to continue using that.\n\nIn practice, the \"Keyword arguments\" style is more idiomatic to Python and aligns well with the community's conventions. However, if you have specific tooling or legacy reasons to use the `@param` syntax, it's perfectly acceptable to do so."
