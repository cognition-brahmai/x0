        "content": "The error you're encountering, `ValueError: dict contains fields not in fieldnames`, is typically due to the discrepancy between the keys in the dictionaries returned by your query and the fieldnames you've specified in the `DictWriter`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure the Query Returns a Dictionary:** The `db.session.execute(selectAttendance)` returns a result set, not a dictionary. You need to iterate over the result set and convert each row to a dictionary that matches your fieldnames.\n\n2. **Adapt the Code to Use Proper Iteration:** You'll need to iterate over each row in the result set and convert it into a dictionary with the appropriate keys. \n\nHere's an updated version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport csv\nimport os\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\n\n# Assume db is your database session/engine object\n# engine = create_engine('your_database_url')  # Example, replace with your actual database URI\n\nselectAttendance = \"\"\"SELECT * FROM table\"\"\"\nresult = db.session.execute(selectAttendance)\n\n# Define the fieldnames that match the columns you expect to retrieve\nfieldnames = [\"Bio_Id\", \"Last_Name\", \"First_Name\", \"late\", \"undertime\", \"total_minutes\", \"total_ot\", \"total_nsd\", \"total_absences\"]\n\nwith open(os.path.join(current_app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], 'csv.csv'), 'w', newline='') as csvfile:\n    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames, delimiter=';')\n    writer.writeheader()\n\n    # Iterate over each row in the result set\n    for row in result:\n        # Convert the row to a dictionary with fieldnames as keys\n        row_dict = dict(zip(fieldnames, row))\n        writer.writerow(row_dict)\n\ndb.session.commit()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Fieldnames Matching:** Ensure that the `fieldnames` list corresponds exactly to the column names you expect in your result set.\n\n- **Convert Rows to Dictionary:** Use `zip(fieldnames, row)` to create a dictionary from the row, mapping each fieldname to the corresponding value.\n\n- **Use `newline=''`:** When opening the file, use `newline=''` to prevent extra newlines in the CSV on Windows systems.\n\n- **Database Session:** Ensure that `db.session.execute(selectAttendance)` is correctly set up to connect to your database and execute queries. If you're using a different method to connect to your database, adjust accordingly.\n\nBy making these changes, your CSV file should be generated correctly without encountering the `ValueError`."
