I have a list of values that I want to pass into `foo`. Is there any particular syntax that allows me to expand this list into the arguments of a function call?\n\nExample code:\n\n```python\n# Trivial example function, not meant to do anything useful.\ndef foo(x,y,z):\n   return \"%d, %d, %d\" %(x,y,z)\n\n# List of values that I want to pass into foo.\nvalues = [1,2,3]\n\n# I want to do something like this, and get the result \"1, 2, 3\":\nfoo( values.howDoYouExpandMe() )\n```"

        "content": "In Python, you can use the unpacking operator `*` to expand a list (or any iterable) into positional arguments in a function call. This allows you to pass the elements of a list as separate arguments to a function. Here's how you can do it with your example:\n\n```python\n# Trivial example function, not meant to do anything useful.\ndef foo(x, y, z):\n    return \"%d, %d, %d\" % (x, y, z)\n\n# List of values that I want to pass into foo.\nvalues = [1, 2, 3]\n\n# Use the unpacking operator * to expand the list into arguments.\nresult = foo(*values)\n\nprint(result)  # Output: \"1, 2, 3\"\n```\n\nIn this example, `*values` unpacks the list `[1, 2, 3]` so that it becomes equivalent to calling `foo(1, 2, 3)`. This is a convenient way to pass a list of arguments to a function when the number of arguments matches the number of elements in the list."
