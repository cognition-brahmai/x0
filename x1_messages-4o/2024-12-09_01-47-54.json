However, when I run `python update_url.py`, I encounter a NameError: global name 'SqliteDBzz' is not defined. How can I resolve this error? Below are the files I'm working with:\n\nThe first file is named sqlitedbx.py and the code is as follows:\n```python\nclass SqliteDBzz:\n    connection = ''\n    curser = ''\n\n    def connect(self):\n        print \"foo\"\n\n    def find_or_create(self, table, column, value):\n        print \"baar\"\n```\n\nThe second file is named update_url.py and the code is as follows:\n```python\nimport sqlitedbx\n\ndef main():\n    db = SqliteDBzz()\n    db.connect\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nWhen I run `python update_url.py`, I get the following error:\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"update_urls.py\", line 7, in <module>\n    main()\n  File \"update_urls.py\", line 4, in main\n    db = SqliteDBzz()\nNameError: global name 'SqliteDBzz' is not defined\n```\nI've tried renaming the files and classes differently, but the error persists. Any suggestions on how to solve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that you are trying to use the `SqliteDBzz` class in `update_url.py` without properly referencing it from the `sqlitedbx` module. When you import a module, you need to access its classes and functions using the module name as a prefix.\n\nHere's how you can resolve the issue:\n\nIn your `update_url.py` file, change the reference to the `SqliteDBzz` class by prefixing it with the module name `sqlitedbx`. Here's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nimport sqlitedbx\n\ndef main():\n    db = sqlitedbx.SqliteDBzz()  # Add the module prefix here\n    db.connect()  # Make sure to call the method with parentheses\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nAdditionally, make sure you call the `connect` method with parentheses to actually invoke it, rather than just referencing it.\n\nThis change should resolve the `NameError` since you're now correctly referencing the `SqliteDBzz` class from the `sqlitedbx` module."
