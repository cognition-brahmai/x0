        "content": "Implementing a graph data structure from scratch in C# involves creating classes to represent vertices (nodes) and edges, and then constructing a graph using these classes. There are different ways to represent a graph, including adjacency lists, adjacency matrices, and edge lists. Here, I'll show you how to implement a graph using an adjacency list, which is efficient for most purposes.\n\n### Components:\n1. **Vertex**: A node in the graph.\n2. **Edge**: A connection between two vertices.\n3. **Graph**: A collection of vertices and edges.\n\n### Implementation Steps:\n\n1. **Define a Vertex Class**: This will represent each node in the graph.\n2. **Define an Edge Class**: This will represent a connection between two nodes. This class might not be needed if you're using an adjacency list, as the connections are implicitly defined by the list.\n3. **Define a Graph Class**: This will manage the vertices and edges.\n\n### Code Example:\n\nHere's a simple implementation using adjacency lists:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\n\npublic class Vertex\n{\n    public int Id { get; private set; }\n    \n    public Vertex(int id)\n    {\n        Id = id;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Graph\n{\n    private Dictionary<Vertex, List<Vertex>> adjacencyList;\n\n    public Graph()\n    {\n        adjacencyList = new Dictionary<Vertex, List<Vertex>>();\n    }\n\n    public void AddVertex(Vertex vertex)\n    {\n        if (!adjacencyList.ContainsKey(vertex))\n        {\n            adjacencyList[vertex] = new List<Vertex>();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void AddEdge(Vertex from, Vertex to)\n    {\n        if (adjacencyList.ContainsKey(from) && adjacencyList.ContainsKey(to))\n        {\n            adjacencyList[from].Add(to);\n            // Uncomment the following line for an undirected graph\n            // adjacencyList[to].Add(from);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void PrintGraph()\n    {\n        foreach (var vertex in adjacencyList)\n        {\n            Console.Write($\"Vertex {vertex.Key.Id}: \");\n            foreach (var edge in vertex.Value)\n            {\n                Console.Write($\"{edge.Id} \");\n            }\n            Console.WriteLine();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Program\n{\n    public static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        Graph graph = new Graph();\n\n        Vertex v1 = new Vertex(1);\n        Vertex v2 = new Vertex(2);\n        Vertex v3 = new Vertex(3);\n        Vertex v4 = new Vertex(4);\n\n        graph.AddVertex(v1);\n        graph.AddVertex(v2);\n        graph.AddVertex(v3);\n        graph.AddVertex(v4);\n\n        graph.AddEdge(v1, v2);\n        graph.AddEdge(v1, v3);\n        graph.AddEdge(v2, v4);\n        graph.AddEdge(v3, v4);\n\n        graph.PrintGraph();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Vertex Class**: Each vertex is identified by a unique ID.\n- **Graph Class**: \n  - Uses a dictionary to store each vertex and its corresponding adjacency list.\n  - `AddVertex` method adds a new vertex to the graph.\n  - `AddEdge` method adds a directed edge from one vertex to another.\n  - `PrintGraph` method prints out the adjacency list representation of the graph.\n  \nThis implementation is a basic example. You can enhance it by adding methods for removing vertices and edges, checking if a path exists between two vertices, implementing depth-first or breadth-first search, etc."
