Can you provide an example of a sample input list, such as [\"word\", \"tiny\", \"lengthyword\", \"medium\", \"longword\"], and the corresponding sorted output list using the custom sorting algorithm in Ruby code?"

        "content": "Certainly! To create a custom sorting algorithm in Ruby that sorts a list of strings based on their character length, you can use the `sort_by` method. This method allows you to specify a criterion for sorting. In this case, we'll use the length of each string as the criterion.\n\nHere's a Ruby code example that demonstrates how to achieve this:\n\n```ruby\n# Sample input list\nwords = [\"word\", \"tiny\", \"lengthyword\", \"medium\", \"longword\"]\n\n# Custom sorting algorithm using sort_by\nsorted_words = words.sort_by { |word| word.length }\n\n# Output the sorted list\nputs sorted_words\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- We have a list of strings called `words`.\n- We use the `sort_by` method, passing a block that returns the length of each string (`word.length`).\n- `sort_by` sorts the strings in ascending order based on the value returned by the block, which in this case is the length of each string.\n- Finally, we print the sorted list.\n\n### Expected Output:\n\nWhen you run the above code, it will output the sorted list of strings based on their character length:\n\n```\ntiny\nword\nmedium\nlongword\nlengthyword\n```\n\nThis output shows the words sorted in ascending order by their length."
