        "content": "To test a single file using `pytest` from the command line, you can simply specify the path to the file you want to test. This allows you to run tests only in that specific file without affecting your IDE settings or needing to modify configuration files. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Open your command line or terminal.\n\n2. Navigate to the directory containing your test files, or provide the full path to the test file.\n\n3. Run the following command, replacing `test_file.py` with the name of the file you want to test:\n\n   ```bash\n   pytest path/to/test_file.py\n   ```\n\nThis command will execute only the tests present in `test_file.py`. If your file is located in a subdirectory, make sure to include the relative or absolute path to the file.\n\nAdditionally, if you want to run a specific test function within that file, you can do so by appending `::test_function_name` to the file path. For example:\n\n```bash\npytest path/to/test_file.py::test_function_name\n```\n\nThis command will run only the specified test function within `test_file.py`. This approach provides a flexible way to test individual files or even specific test cases without altering your overall test configuration."
