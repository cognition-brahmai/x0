        "content": "In Python, you can manually raise an exception using the `raise` statement. This allows you to create an exception at a specific point in your code which can later be caught using an `except` block. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Raising an Exception\n\nTo raise an exception, you can use the `raise` keyword followed by an instance of an exception class. Python has many built-in exceptions, such as `ValueError`, `TypeError`, `KeyError`, etc., but you can also create your own custom exceptions by defining a new class that inherits from the base `Exception` class.\n\nHere's an example of raising a built-in exception:\n\n```python\n# Raising a built-in exception\ndef divide(a, b):\n    if b == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"The denominator cannot be zero.\")\n    return a / b\n\ntry:\n    result = divide(10, 0)\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(f\"Caught an exception: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Raising a Custom Exception\n\nYou can define your own exception class and raise it:\n\n```python\n# Defining a custom exception\nclass MyCustomError(Exception):\n    pass\n\ndef do_something(value):\n    if value < 0:\n        raise MyCustomError(\"Negative value is not allowed.\")\n\ntry:\n    do_something(-1)\nexcept MyCustomError as e:\n    print(f\"Caught a custom exception: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n1. **Raise Statement**: Use `raise` followed by an exception instance to raise an exception.\n2. **Custom Exceptions**: Inherit from the `Exception` class to create custom exceptions.\n3. **Handling Exceptions**: Use `try` and `except` blocks to catch and handle exceptions.\n\nRaising exceptions is a powerful way to handle error conditions gracefully and can be an important part of robust program design."
