I want to test my Scrapy spiders with it, but I am not sure how to do this. I have tried running the spider as a script and also added my Scrapy project to PyCharm as a model by going to File -> Setting -> Project structure -> Add content root. What should I do next?"

        "content": "To debug Scrapy projects using PyCharm, you'll need to set up your environment and configure PyCharm correctly to work with Scrapy. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you debug your Scrapy spiders with PyCharm:\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Your Scrapy Project in PyCharm\n\n1. **Create a PyCharm Project**: Open PyCharm and create a new project or open your existing Scrapy project. Make sure that the Python interpreter is set to Python 2.7 since you are using Scrapy 0.20.\n\n2. **Configure the Project Structure**: Ensure the Scrapy project directory is added as a content root and the \"scrapy.cfg\" file is recognized. Go to `File -> Project Structure -> Add Content Root` and select your Scrapy project directory.\n\n### Step 2: Configure the Scrapy Settings\n\n1. **Environment Variables**: Scrapy uses environment variables for configuration. You need to set the `PYTHONPATH` to the path of your Scrapy project. You can do this in PyCharm by going to `Run -> Edit Configurations -> Environment Variables`.\n\n2. **Configure Scrapy Settings**: You might want to set some Scrapy settings directly in your `settings.py` file for your project or set them as environment variables.\n\n### Step 3: Create a Run/Debug Configuration\n\n1. **Create a New Configuration**: In PyCharm, go to `Run -> Edit Configurations` and click on the `+` button to add a new Python configuration.\n\n2. **Script Path**: Set the script path to the Scrapy command-line tool, which is usually located in the `Scripts` directory of your Python installation (e.g., `C:\\Python27\\Scripts\\scrapy` on Windows or `/usr/local/bin/scrapy` on macOS/Linux).\n\n3. **Parameters**: In the parameters field, specify the command to run your spider. For example, to run a spider named `my_spider`, you would enter `crawl my_spider`.\n\n4. **Working Directory**: Set the working directory to your Scrapy project directory.\n\n5. **Environment Variables**: Ensure that the `PYTHONPATH` is set to include your Scrapy project directory if not already done.\n\n### Step 4: Debugging\n\n1. **Set Breakpoints**: Open the spider file you wish to debug and set breakpoints at the locations where you want to pause execution and inspect variables.\n\n2. **Run in Debug Mode**: Click the debug icon next to your configuration in the top-right corner of PyCharm or press `Shift + F9`. This will start the Scrapy spider in debug mode, allowing you to step through your code and inspect variables.\n\n3. **Inspect Variables and Execution Flow**: Use the PyCharm debugger tools to inspect variables, evaluate expressions, and step through the code.\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- **Logging**: Enable logging in your `settings.py` or directly in your spider to have better insights into the execution process.\n\n- **Scrapy Shell**: Use the Scrapy shell (`scrapy shell <url>`) for quick testing and debugging of selectors.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to effectively debug your Scrapy spiders using PyCharm."
