Even though I have imported the file, Python seems to not recognize the class. Here are my class definition in testmodule.py and my main Python file:\n\nClass definition in testmodule.py:\n```\nclass Greeter:\n    def __init__(self, arg1=None):\n        self.text = arg1\n\n    def say_hi(self):\n        return self.text\n```\n\nmain.py:\n```\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport testmodule\n\nsayinghi = Greeter(\"hello world!\")\nprint(sayinghi.say_hi())\n```\nI suspect that the import isn't functioning as intended. Can anyone advise how to correctly import and use the class from the imported file?"

        "content": "It looks like you're facing an issue with how you're referencing the class from the imported module. When you import a module in Python, you need to access its classes or functions using the module name unless you explicitly import them. Here's how you can fix it:\n\nIn your `main.py`, you should refer to the `Greeter` class via the `testmodule` namespace. Here's the corrected version of your `main.py`:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport testmodule\n\nsayinghi = testmodule.Greeter(\"hello world!\")\nprint(sayinghi.say_hi())\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you want to import the `Greeter` class directly so you don't have to prefix it with `testmodule`, you can change the import statement in `main.py` like this:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/python\nfrom testmodule import Greeter\n\nsayinghi = Greeter(\"hello world!\")\nprint(sayinghi.say_hi())\n```\n\nMake sure that both `main.py` and `testmodule.py` are in the same directory or adjust the import path accordingly if they are located in different directories. Ensure there are no file name conflicts with `testmodule`, such as a file named `testmodule.py` in a different directory that could be getting imported instead."
