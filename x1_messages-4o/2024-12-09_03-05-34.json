        "content": "How can I properly mock a global variable in a module for unit testing? I have a module named `alphabet.py` which includes a global variable `letters` that gets its value from a database. I want to mock the response from this database with some values of my choice for testing purposes. I've tried using `patch` from `unittest.mock` to mock the global variable, but it doesn't seem to work. I've seen many examples where 'patch' is used for methods and classes, but not for variables. I prefer not to patch the method `database.get` because I may use it again with different parameters later on. Here is the code I've used:\n\n```python\n# alphabet.py\nimport database\n\ndef length_letters():\n    return len(letters)\n\ndef contains_letter(letter):\n    return True if letter in letters else False\n\nletters = database.get('letters')   # returns a list of letters\n```\n\nAnd the test I've written:\n\n```python\n# test file\nimport unittests  \nimport alphabet   \nfrom unittest.mock import patch \n\nclass TestAlphabet(unittest.TestCase): \n    @patch('alphabet.letters')\n    def setUp(self, mock_letters):\n        mock_letters.return_value = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n\n    def test_length_letters(self):\n        self.assertEqual(3, alphabet.length_letters())\n\n    def test_contains_letter(self):   \n        self.assertTrue(alphabet.contains_letter('a'))\n```\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is with the way you're attempting to mock the global variable `letters` in the `alphabet` module. Using `patch` on variables requires some care, especially when you're dealing directly with module-level variables. Let's go through the correct approach to mock your global variable `letters`.\n\nHere's how you can properly mock the global variable using `patch`:\n\n1. **Import the Module Correctly**: Ensure that you're importing the module correctly in your test file. You're doing it right by importing `alphabet`.\n\n2. **Patch the Module's Global Variable**: Use the `patch` function to target the global variable directly. You should patch `alphabet.letters` directly in the scope of your tests.\n\n3. **Assign a Value to the Mocked Variable**: Instead of setting a return value like you would for a function, you should directly assign a value to the mock object.\n\nHere's how you can modify your test to correctly mock the `letters` variable:\n\n```python\n# test_alphabet.py\nimport unittest\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\nimport alphabet\n\nclass TestAlphabet(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Patch the 'letters' variable in the 'alphabet' module\n        patcher = patch('alphabet.letters', new=['a', 'b', 'c'])\n        self.addCleanup(patcher.stop)\n        self.mock_letters = patcher.start()\n\n    def test_length_letters(self):\n        self.assertEqual(alphabet.length_letters(), 3)\n\n    def test_contains_letter(self):\n        self.assertTrue(alphabet.contains_letter('a'))\n        self.assertFalse(alphabet.contains_letter('d'))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Patching the Correct Target**: Use `'alphabet.letters'` as the target for the patch. This directly targets the `letters` variable in the `alphabet` module.\n\n- **Using `new=` Parameter**: When patching a variable, use the `new=` parameter to set the value you want the variable to have during your tests.\n\n- **Cleanup**: Use `self.addCleanup(patcher.stop)` to ensure that the patch is removed after the test, preventing side effects on other tests.\n\nThis approach should allow your tests to properly mock the global variable and give you the expected results."
