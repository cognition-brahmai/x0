You can modify this code to suit your specific recipe and ingredient list."

        "content": "Certainly! The Ruby code you provided is a good starting point for calculating ingredient quantities per person. Below is an expanded version of the code that includes some additional features. This code calculates ingredients for a given number of people and prints a list of ingredients with the required quantities for the entire group as well as per person.\n\n```ruby\n# Number of people to serve\nnum_people = 4\n\n# Ingredients list for a spaghetti dish\nspaghetti = {\n  \"pasta\": {\n    \"type\": \"spaghetti\",\n    \"quantity\": 12,\n    \"unit\": \"ounces\"\n  },\n  \"tomato_sauce\": {\n    \"quantity\": 2,\n    \"unit\": \"cups\"\n  },\n  \"garlic\": {\n    \"quantity\": 4,\n    \"unit\": \"cloves\"\n  },\n  \"olive_oil\": {\n    \"quantity\": 2,\n    \"unit\": \"tablespoons\"\n  },\n  \"parmesan_cheese\": {\n    \"quantity\": 1,\n    \"unit\": \"cup\"\n  }\n}\n\n# Function to print ingredient quantities\ndef print_ingredients(ingredients, num_people)\n  ingredients.each do |ingredient, details|\n    if details[:quantity] != nil\n      total_quantity = details[:quantity]\n      quantity_per_person = total_quantity.to_f / num_people\n      puts \"#{total_quantity} #{details[:unit]} of #{ingredient} for #{num_people} people\"\n      puts \"#{quantity_per_person.round(2)} #{details[:unit]} of #{ingredient} per person\"\n    else\n      puts \"#{details[:unit]} of #{ingredient}\"\n    end\n    puts \"-\" * 50\n  end\nend\n\n# Print the ingredients with quantities\nprint_ingredients(spaghetti, num_people)\n```\n\n### Key Features\n1. **Total and Per Person Quantities**: The code calculates and prints both the total quantity needed for the group and the quantity per person.\n2. **Flexibility**: You can easily modify the `spaghetti` hash to include more ingredients or adjust quantities to suit different recipes.\n3. **Precision**: The `quantity_per_person` is rounded to two decimal places for clarity.\n\nYou can adapt this code to include more dishes or modify the ingredient list as needed for different recipes or serving sizes. This approach provides a clear and organized way to handle ingredient calculations in Ruby."
