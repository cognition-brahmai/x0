        "content": "To construct a query in SQLAlchemy/Flask that selects all `Item` rows with a specific version and orders them by `Group` and then by `Member`, you need to ensure that the joins and filters are correctly setup. Based on your table setup, you need to join the tables properly and apply the necessary filters and orderings. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import aliased\n\n# Aliasing the Group and Member tables for clarity\nGroupAlias = aliased(Group)\nMemberAlias = aliased(Member)\n\n# Constructing the query\nitems = (\n    session.query(Item)\n    .join(Member, Item.member == Member.id)  # Joining Item with Member\n    .join(Group, Member.groupid == Group.id)  # Joining Member with Group\n    .join(Version, Item.version == Version.id)  # Joining Item with Version\n    .filter(Version.id == 1)  # Filtering by version\n    .order_by(Group.number, Member.number)  # Ordering by Group and then Member\n    .all()\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Joins**: You need to join `Item` with `Member`, `Member` with `Group`, and `Item` with `Version`. This ensures you can filter and sort based on related tables.\n   \n2. **Filtering**: The `.filter(Version.id == 1)` ensures that only items with the specified version are selected.\n\n3. **Ordering**: The `.order_by(Group.number, Member.number)` orders the results first by the group number and then by the member number.\n\n### Important Note:\n- Ensure your relationships are correctly set up with backrefs so you can easily navigate between tables.\n- The `aliased` function is used when necessary to differentiate between multiple joins of the same table or for clarity in complex queries, but it may not be needed in this specific case since there's a single join path.\n- Make sure that `session` refers to your SQLAlchemy session object, which is used to perform database operations.\n\nThis query should give you a list of `Item` objects ordered by their `Group` and `Member`. Adjust the filtering condition as needed to match your specific requirements if the version ID needs to change."
