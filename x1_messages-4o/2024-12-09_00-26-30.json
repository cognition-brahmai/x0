        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to trying to concatenate a string with an integer directly. In Python, you need to explicitly convert the integer to a string before concatenating it with other strings. There are several ways to achieve this in both Python 2.x and 3.x:\n\n### Method 1: Using `str()` function\n\nYou can convert the integer to a string using the `str()` function and then concatenate:\n\n```python\nthings = 5\nprint(\"You have \" + str(things) + \" things.\")\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using string formatting with `%`\n\nThis method works in both Python 2.x and 3.x:\n\n```python\nthings = 5\nprint(\"You have %d things.\" % things)\n```\n\n### Method 3: Using `format()` method\n\nThis method is available in both Python 2.7 and 3.x:\n\n```python\nthings = 5\nprint(\"You have {} things.\".format(things))\n```\n\n### Method 4: Using f-strings (Python 3.6+)\n\nF-strings provide a convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces `{}`:\n\n```python\nthings = 5\nprint(f\"You have {things} things.\")\n```\n\nChoose any of the methods above based on your Python version and preference. All of these methods will correctly concatenate the string and integer without causing a `TypeError`."
