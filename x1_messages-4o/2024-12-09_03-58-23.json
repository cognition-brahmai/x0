I'm looking for a solution that will do the following when a shortcut key is pressed: If the current file extension is 'c', it should run 'gcc this_filename.c -o this_filename_without_extension' in the shell and if the return code equals 0, it should then run './this_filename_without_extension'. If the current file extension is 'cpp', it should run 'g++ this_filename.cpp -o this_filename_without_extension' and if the return code equals 0, it should then run './this_filename_without_extension'. If the current file extension is 'py', it should run 'python this_filename.py'."

        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this by setting up a custom command in your Vim configuration file (`.vimrc`). The idea is to create a function that checks the file extension and then executes the appropriate compile and run command based on the extension. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Open your `.vimrc` file in Vim:\n\n   ```bash\n   vim ~/.vimrc\n   ```\n\n2. Add the following function and key mapping to your `.vimrc`:\n\n   ```vim\n   function! CompileAndRun()\n     \" Get the current file's name and extension\n     let l:filename = expand('%:t')\n     let l:fileext = expand('%:e')\n     let l:filebasename = expand('%:t:r')\n\n     \" Check the file extension and execute the appropriate command\n     if l:fileext == 'c'\n       \" Compile C file and run\n       let l:command = 'gcc ' . l:filename . ' -o ' . l:filebasename . ' && ./' . l:filebasename\n     elseif l:fileext == 'cpp'\n       \" Compile C++ file and run\n       let l:command = 'g++ ' . l:filename . ' -o ' . l:filebasename . ' && ./' . l:filebasename\n     elseif l:fileext == 'py'\n       \" Run Python file\n       let l:command = 'python ' . l:filename\n     else\n       echo \"Unsupported file type\"\n       return\n     endif\n\n     \" Execute the command in a terminal\n     execute '!' . l:command\n   endfunction\n\n   \" Map the function to a shortcut (e.g., <F5>)\n   nnoremap <F5> :call CompileAndRun()<CR>\n   ```\n\n3. Save and close the `.vimrc` file.\n\nNow, whenever you're editing a C, C++, or Python file in Vim, you can press `<F5>` to compile and run the program. If the file is a C or C++ file, it will compile and run the executable if the compilation is successful. If it is a Python file, it will simply run the script.\n\nFeel free to change `<F5>` to any other key combination you prefer. Simply replace `<F5>` in the `nnoremap` line with your desired keybinding."
