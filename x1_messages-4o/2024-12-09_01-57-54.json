Additionally, I am utilizing python lists as part of the query as shown in the code below: \n```\ndb.session.query(Item).filter(Item.symbol.in_(add_symbols))\n```\nwhere `Item` is my model class and `add_symbols` is a list). This is equivalent to SQL `SELECT ... from ... WHERE ... IN`. Is there a solution for this?"

        "content": "Yes, you can convert a SQLAlchemy Query object to a pandas DataFrame without using raw SQL. SQLAlchemy allows you to work with ORM models, and you can use the results from these queries to create a DataFrame. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Execute the Query**: First, you need to execute your query to get the results.\n\n2. **Convert Results to a List of Dictionaries**: You can convert the results to a list of dictionaries, which is a format easily ingestible by pandas.\n\n3. **Create a Pandas DataFrame**: Finally, create a DataFrame from the list of dictionaries.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming you have already defined your SQLAlchemy engine and session\n# engine = create_engine('your_database_url')\nSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\nsession = Session()\n\n# Your query\nquery = session.query(Item).filter(Item.symbol.in_(add_symbols))\n\n# Executing the query and retrieving results as a list of dictionaries\nresults = query.all()\n\n# Convert to a list of dictionaries\ndata = [result.__dict__ for result in results]\n\n# Optionally, remove the SQLAlchemy internal state\nfor item in data:\n    item.pop('_sa_instance_state', None)\n\n# Create DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Optionally, close the session\nsession.close()\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- The `query.all()` method retrieves all the results of the query.\n- `__dict__` is used to convert each ORM object to a dictionary.\n- The `_sa_instance_state` attribute is an internal SQLAlchemy attribute, so you might want to remove it before converting it to a DataFrame.\n- Use `session.close()` to close the session when you\u2019re done with the database operations.\n\nThis approach effectively bridges SQLAlchemy with pandas, allowing you to work with your data in a familiar DataFrame format while still using the ORM."
