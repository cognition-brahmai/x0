First, solve the multiplication inside the parentheses:\n\n   \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\)\n\n2. Substitute back into the expression:\n\n   \\(8 - 10 + 4\\)\n\n3. Then, perform the subtraction and addition from left to right:\n\n   \\(8 - 10 = -2\\)\n\n4. Finally, add 4:\n\n   \\(-2 + 4 = 2\\)\n\nSo, the result of the expression is \\(2\\)."
