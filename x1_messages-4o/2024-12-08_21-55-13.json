The program should be able to handle strings of any length, and should also be able to handle non-English strings, such as those written in Chinese, Arabic, or Russian. As an example, apply this program to the following list of strings: [\"Hello World!\", \"Bonjour le Monde!\", \"\u4f60\u597d\uff0c\u4e16\u754c\uff01\", \"\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442, \u043c\u0438\u0440!\"]"

        "content": "To accomplish this task, we will write a Python program that reads a list of strings, removes vowels from each string, and then prints the resulting strings in a table format. The program should handle non-English strings gracefully by focusing on removing vowels only from the Latin alphabet. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef remove_vowels(text):\n    vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n    return ''.join(char for char in text if char not in vowels)\n\ndef print_table(strings):\n    # Process each string to remove vowels\n    processed_strings = [remove_vowels(s) for s in strings]\n\n    # Find the length of the longest string for formatting\n    max_length = max(len(s) for s in processed_strings)\n\n    # Print the table with each processed string\n    print(\"Vowel-less Strings Table:\")\n    print(\"-\" * (max_length + 4))\n    for s in processed_strings:\n        print(f\"| {s.ljust(max_length)} |\")\n    print(\"-\" * (max_length + 4))\n\n# Example list of strings\nstrings_list = [\"Hello World!\", \"Bonjour le Monde!\", \"\u4f60\u597d\uff0c\u4e16\u754c\uff01\", \"\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442, \u043c\u0438\u0440!\"]\n\n# Output the table\nprint_table(strings_list)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **remove_vowels Function**:\n   - This function takes a string as input and returns a new string with all Latin vowels removed.\n   - It uses a generator expression to iterate over each character, only including those that are not vowels.\n\n2. **print_table Function**:\n   - This function takes a list of strings, processes each string to remove vowels, and prints them in a formatted table.\n   - It calculates the maximum string length among the processed strings to ensure uniform table formatting.\n   - It prints each processed string in a separate row, using the `ljust` method to align the text.\n\n3. **Handling Non-English Strings**:\n   - Non-English characters (e.g., Chinese, Arabic, Cyrillic) are preserved because the vowel removal is focused solely on the Latin alphabet.\n\n4. **Example Usage**:\n   - The example list contains strings in English, French, Chinese, and Russian. The program will remove vowels from the English and French strings, while leaving the Chinese and Russian strings unchanged.\n\nBy running this program, you will get a table where each row corresponds to a vowel-less version of the input strings."
