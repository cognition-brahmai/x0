        "content": "In Django, I have numerous loggers with hard-coded names throughout my project. For module-level logging (i.e., in a module of view functions), I am considering using `log = logging.getLogger(__name__)`. For class-level logging (i.e., in a class `__init__` method), I am thinking of using `self.log = logging.getLogger(\"%s.%s\" % (self.__module__, self.__class__.__name__))`. I want a second opinion before I replace several dozens of occurrences of `getLogger(\"hard.coded.name\")`. Will this approach work? Does anyone else name their loggers in the same way? Should I write a class decorator for this log definition?"

        "content": "Your proposed approach for logging in Django using `logging.getLogger(__name__)` for module-level logging and `self.log = logging.getLogger(\"%s.%s\" % (self.__module__, self.__class__.__name__))` for class-level logging is a common and recommended practice. This approach offers several benefits:\n\n1. **Automatic Naming**: It automatically generates logger names based on the module and class name, making it easy to identify where logs are coming from without hard-coding names.\n\n2. **Consistency**: By using `__name__` and `self.__module__`, `self.__class__.__name__`, you maintain a consistent naming convention across your project, which simplifies configuration and log filtering.\n\n3. **Scalability**: If your project grows or changes structure, using dynamic names ensures that your logging remains accurate without requiring manual updates.\n\n4. **Namespace Alignment**: This approach aligns the logger's namespace with your Python module/package structure, making it intuitive and organized.\n\nIn terms of whether others use this approach, many developers prefer this method for its simplicity and alignment with Python's dynamic nature. It's widely adopted in various Python projects, particularly where modularity and clarity are important.\n\nRegarding writing a class decorator for this log definition, it could be useful if you have a large number of classes and want to ensure consistency without repeating boilerplate code. A decorator can automatically assign a logger to each class, streamlining the process. Here\u2019s a simple example of how such a decorator might look:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\ndef attach_logger(cls):\n    cls.log = logging.getLogger(f\"{cls.__module__}.{cls.__name__}\")\n    return cls\n\n@attach_logger\nclass MyClass:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.log.info(\"Logger attached\")\n\n# Usage\nmy_instance = MyClass()\nmy_instance.log.info(\"This is a log message from MyClass\")\n```\n\nThis decorator ensures that every class has a logger attached without duplicating code, enhancing maintainability. Overall, your proposed changes are solid, and implementing a decorator could further streamline your logging setup."
