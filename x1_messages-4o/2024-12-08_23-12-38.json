Here's a detailed guide to help you:\n\n### Ingredients and Equipment:\n- **Loose Leaf Earl Grey Tea:** High-quality Earl Grey tea leaves.\n- **Glass Teapot:** Preferably with an infuser or strainer.\n- **Filtered Water**\n- **Optional Accompaniments:** Honey, lemon, or milk.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Measure the Tea:**\n   - Use about 1 teaspoon of loose leaf Earl Grey tea per 8-ounce cup of water. Adjust the quantity based on the size of your glass teapot.\n\n2. **Heat the Water:**\n   - Heat the water to about 200\u00b0F (93\u00b0C). This is just below boiling and ideal for black tea to release its full flavor without becoming bitter.\n\n3. **Pre-warm the Teapot:**\n   - Pour a little hot water into the glass teapot and swirl it around to warm the glass. This helps maintain the water temperature during steeping. Discard the water afterward.\n\n4. **Add Tea Leaves:**\n   - Place the measured tea leaves into the infuser or directly into the teapot if you plan to strain them later.\n\n5. **Pour the Water:**\n   - Pour the hot water over the tea leaves, allowing them to steep. Ensure the leaves are fully submerged.\n\n6. **Steep the Tea:**\n   - Let the tea steep for about 3 to 5 minutes. Earl Grey can become bitter if steeped too long, so taste it at 3 minutes and adjust according to your preference.\n\n7. **Strain and Serve:**\n   - If you have an infuser, simply remove it. If not, pour the tea through a strainer into cups to catch the leaves.\n\n8. **Accompaniments:**\n   - **Honey:** Add a teaspoon of honey for natural sweetness.\n   - **Lemon:** A slice of lemon can enhance the bergamot flavor in Earl Grey.\n   - **Milk:** Some enjoy a splash of milk, but avoid lemon if you add milk to prevent curdling.\n\n9. **Enjoy:**\n   - Sip and enjoy your perfectly brewed cup of Earl Grey tea!\n\n### Tips:\n- Store your loose leaf tea in an airtight container away from light, heat, and moisture to preserve its flavor.\n- Experiment with steeping times and accompaniments to find your perfect cup. \n\nFollowing these steps will help you brew a delicious cup of Earl Grey tea that highlights its distinctive bergamot flavor."
