I have a boolean mask array `a` of length `n`:\n\n```python\na = np.array([True, True, True, False, False])\n```\n\nand a 2D array with `n` columns:\n\n```python\nb = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5], [1,2,3,4,5]])\n```\n\nI would like to create a new array which contains only the \"True\"-values from the boolean mask array. Ideally, the result should be:\n\n```python\nc = ([[1,2,3], [1,2,3]])\n```\n\nI have tried using `c = a * b`, but it also includes \"0\" for the false columns which I don't want. I also tried `c = np.delete(b, a, 1)`, but it didn't work. Any suggestions for how to do this?"

        "content": "To select elements of a NumPy array using a boolean mask, you can use boolean indexing. In your case, since you have a boolean mask `a` and a 2D array `b`, you can directly apply the mask to select the desired columns. Here is how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Your boolean mask and 2D array\na = np.array([True, True, True, False, False])\nb = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]])\n\n# Use the boolean mask to index the columns of `b`\nc = b[:, a]\n\n# Display the result\nprint(c)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n[[1 2 3]\n [1 2 3]]\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `b[:, a]` uses the boolean mask `a` to select columns from each row in the 2D array `b`. The `:` operator means \"select all rows\", and `a` specifies which columns to keep based on the `True` values in the mask. This way, only the columns corresponding to `True` in `a` will be retained, giving you the desired result without any unwanted zeroes."
