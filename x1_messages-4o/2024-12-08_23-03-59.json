        "content": "To solve the equation \\(3X^3 - 8X^2 + 5X - 2 = 0\\) for the smallest positive integer value of \\(X\\), we can first try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. This theorem states that any rational solution, expressed as a fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), must have \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term (-2) and \\(q\\) as a factor of the leading coefficient (3).\n\nThe factors of -2 are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\), and the factors of 3 are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 3\\). Thus, the possible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm \\frac{1}{3}, \\pm \\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\nLet's test these possible roots by substituting them into the equation:\n\n1. \\(X = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   3(1)^3 - 8(1)^2 + 5(1) - 2 = 3 - 8 + 5 - 2 = -2 \\neq 0\n   \\]\n\n2. \\(X = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   3(2)^3 - 8(2)^2 + 5(2) - 2 = 24 - 32 + 10 - 2 = 0\n   \\]\n\nSince \\(X = 2\\) makes the equation equal to zero, \\(X = 2\\) is a root of the equation.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer value of \\(X\\) that satisfies the equation is \\(X = 2\\)."
