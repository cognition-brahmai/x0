They seem to have different backward passes which is confusing because `.clamp` is used equivalently to `relu` in PyTorch tutorials. I have a simple fully connected network with one hidden layer and a relu activation (linear in the output layer). I believe the output of the following code should be just zeros, but it's not. Can someone help me understand this issue?\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```python\nimport torch\ndtype = torch.float\n\nx = torch.tensor([[3,2,1],\n                  [1,0,2],\n                  [4,1,2],\n                  [0,0,1]], dtype=dtype)\n\ny = torch.ones(4,4)\n\nw1_a = torch.tensor([[1,2],\n                     [0,1],\n                     [4,0]], dtype=dtype, requires_grad=True)\nw1_b = w1_a.clone().detach()\nw1_b.requires_grad = True\n\nw2_a = torch.tensor([[-1, 1],\n                     [-2, 3]], dtype=dtype, requires_grad=True)\nw2_b = w2_a.clone().detach()\nw2_b.requires_grad = True\n\ny_hat_a = torch.nn.functional.relu(x.mm(w1_a)).mm(w2_a)\ny_a = torch.ones_like(y_hat_a)\ny_hat_b = x.mm(w1_b).clamp(min=0).mm(w2_b)\ny_b = torch.ones_like(y_hat_b)\n\nloss_a = (y_hat_a - y_a).pow(2).sum()\nloss_b = (y_hat_b - y_b).pow(2).sum()\n\nloss_a.backward()\nloss_b.backward()\n\nprint(w1_a.grad - w1_b.grad)\nprint(w2_a.grad - w2_b.grad)\n\n# OUT:\n# tensor([[  0.,   0.],\n#         [  0.,   0.],\n#         [  0., -38.]])\n# tensor([[0., 0.],\n#         [0., 0.]])\n```"

        "content": "In the provided code, you are observing different gradients for `w1_a` and `w1_b`, which might seem confusing because `.clamp(min=0)` and `nn.functional.relu()` are supposed to behave similarly, at least in terms of their forward operations. However, there might be subtle differences in their backward passes due to how PyTorch handles them internally.\n\n1. **Understanding `relu` and `clamp`:**\n\n   - `relu(x)` is equivalent to `torch.max(x, torch.tensor(0.0))`.\n   - `clamp(x, min=0)` is equivalent to setting all negative values in `x` to zero.\n\n   Both operations should, in theory, result in the same zeroing of negative values in their outputs. However, the implementation details of their backward passes can sometimes lead to differences, especially in edge cases or due to optimizations in the underlying library.\n\n2. **Gradient Discrepancy:**\n\n   The primary source of discrepancy in gradients might come from how each operation handles zero and near-zero values during the backward pass. Specifically, consider:\n\n   - `relu` might have a slightly different behavior when computing gradients at zero due to its reliance on comparisons.\n   - `clamp`, on the other hand, is a more straightforward thresholding operation, but still might have differences in gradient computation due to its implementation.\n\n3. **Debugging Steps:**\n\n   To further investigate, you can try the following:\n\n   - **Check Intermediate Gradients:** Print the gradients before the final backward pass to see where they start to diverge.\n   - **Validate Forward Outputs:** Ensure that the outputs of the activation layers (`relu` vs `clamp`) are identical before the final matrix multiplication.\n   - **Precision Issues:** Sometimes, numerical stability or precision issues might lead to very small differences that accumulate.\n\n4. **Code Adjustments:**\n\n   If you want to ensure that both operations behave identically, you can explicitly define the operations using `torch.max()` or another consistent method to see if that resolves the discrepancy:\n\n   ```python\n   y_hat_b = torch.max(x.mm(w1_b), torch.tensor(0.0, dtype=dtype)).mm(w2_b)\n   ```\n\n5. **Explore PyTorch's Source:**\n\n   If you're comfortable, you can look into PyTorch's source code for both `relu` and `clamp` to understand any differences in their backward implementations.\n\nIn summary, while theoretically equivalent, implementation details can cause small discrepancies in computed gradients, and understanding these differences requires a deep dive into the library's internal workings."
