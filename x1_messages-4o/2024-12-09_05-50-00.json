The tilde operator is used to negate a condition in Pandas. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n```python\ndf2 = df[~df['A'].str.contains(\"Hello|World\")]\n```\n\nBy adding the `~` operator before `df['A'].str.contains(\"Hello|World\")`, it will select all rows where the 'A' column does **not** contain \"Hello\" or \"World\"."
