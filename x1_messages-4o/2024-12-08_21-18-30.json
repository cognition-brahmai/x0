        "content": "To solve the problem, we will first address the equation involving \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\ny^2 - 10y + 25 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis equation can be recognized as a perfect square trinomial. It can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\n(y - 5)^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving this equation gives:\n\n\\[\ny - 5 = 0 \\implies y = 5\n\\]\n\nThe sum of all possible values of \\( y \\) is simply 5, since \\( y = 5 \\) is the only solution.\n\nNext, we utilize this result to consider the original equation involving \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx^3 - 5x^2 + 8x - 4 = 0\n\\]\n\nTo find the sum of all possible values of \\( x \\) that satisfy this equation, we use Vieta's formulas, which relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots. According to Vieta\u2019s formulas, for a cubic equation \\( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 \\), the sum of the roots \\( x_1, x_2, x_3 \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nx_1 + x_2 + x_3 = -\\frac{b}{a}\n\\]\n\nFor the equation \\( x^3 - 5x^2 + 8x - 4 = 0 \\), the coefficients are \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -5 \\), \\( c = 8 \\), and \\( d = -4 \\). Thus, the sum of the roots is:\n\n\\[\nx_1 + x_2 + x_3 = -\\frac{-5}{1} = 5\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of all possible values of \\( x \\) that satisfy the original equation is \\(\\boxed{5}\\)."
