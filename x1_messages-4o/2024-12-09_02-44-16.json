Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming your file is named 'data.csv'\nfile_path = 'data.csv'\n\n# Read the CSV file without headers, and select only the 4th and 7th columns\n# Remember that column indices start at 0, so the 4th column is index 3 and the 7th is index 6\ndf = pd.read_csv(file_path, header=None, usecols=[3, 6])\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nIn this code snippet:\n- `header=None` tells pandas that the file does not have a header row, so it will treat the first row as data.\n- `usecols=[3, 6]` specifies that you want to select only the 4th and 7th columns (considering zero-based indexing, these are columns with indices 3 and 6).\n\nThis should correctly read your `.csv` file and extract only the specified columns."
