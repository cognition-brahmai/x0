If you subtract me from the sum of 4, 6, and 8, the result will be the same as if you multiplied me by 3 and then added 2. What number am I?\nHint: The answer to this riddle shares a characteristic with the primary benefit of using machine learning in developing a predictive model for customer churn in a subscription-based business."

        "content": "Let's solve the riddle step by step:\n\n1. **Sum of 4, 6, and 8**:  \n   \\(4 + 6 + 8 = 18\\)\n\n2. **Subtract the number (let's call it \\(x\\)) from 18**:  \n   \\(18 - x\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the number by 3 and add 2**:  \n   \\(3x + 2\\)\n\nAccording to the riddle, these two expressions are equal:\n\n\\[18 - x = 3x + 2\\]\n\nLet's solve for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[18 - x = 3x + 2\\]\n\nAdd \\(x\\) to both sides:\n\n\\[18 = 4x + 2\\]\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\n\\[16 = 4x\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n\\[x = 4\\]\n\nTherefore, the number is 4.\n\nNow, let's relate this to the primary advantage of incorporating machine learning into the development of a predictive model for customer churn in a subscription-based business. The characteristic shared by both the number 4 and the benefit of machine learning is **\"efficiency.\"**\n\nMachine learning models can efficiently analyze large volumes of data to identify patterns and predict outcomes, such as customer churn. Just as the number 4 efficiently satisfies the conditions of the riddle, machine learning provides an efficient approach to developing robust predictive models."
