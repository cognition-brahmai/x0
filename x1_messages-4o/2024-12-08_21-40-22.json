He is well-known for his work on films like \"Inception,\" \"The Dark Knight,\" and \"Interstellar,\" which fall under genres such as science fiction, thriller, action, crime, drama, adventure, and sci-fi. However, Christopher Nolan has not directed a film that won the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or award.\n\nThe code you provided has a logical flaw as it's trying to match Christopher Nolan with the Palme d'Or winners, but none of his films have won that particular award.\n\nRegarding the director of \"Pulp Fiction,\" it is Quentin Tarantino. \"Pulp Fiction\" won the Palme d'Or in 1994 and falls under the crime and drama genres."
