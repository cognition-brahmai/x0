The error is an AssertionError stating that the database connection isn't set to UTC. I can create a superuser without any issues, but when I try to log in to my site, I get the error. My PostgreSQL database is set to UTC and all parameters are aligned with the Django documentation. What could be causing this error and how can I fix it?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that Django expects the database connection's timezone to be set to UTC, but it isn't detecting it as such. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Django Settings:**\n   - Ensure that your `settings.py` file has the following settings:\n     ```python\n     USE_TZ = True\n     TIME_ZONE = 'UTC'\n     ```\n\n2. **Verify PostgreSQL Time Zone Configuration:**\n   - Connect to your PostgreSQL database and check the timezone settings. You can do this by running the following SQL command:\n     ```sql\n     SHOW timezone;\n     ```\n   - If it doesn't return `UTC`, you can set it by running:\n     ```sql\n     SET TIMEZONE='UTC';\n     ```\n   - To make this change permanent, you can update the `postgresql.conf` file. Look for the `timezone` setting and set it to `UTC`.\n\n3. **Check Connection Time Zone:**\n   - If you're using a database connection pool or some middleware that might be altering the connection settings, ensure that it isn't changing the timezone.\n\n4. **Database Adapter:**\n   - Ensure you are using a compatible database adapter (e.g., `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL) and that it is up to date. Sometimes, compatibility issues between Django and the database adapter can lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n5. **Environment Variables:**\n   - Check if there are any environment variables that might be affecting the timezone setting. In some environments, `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` or other environment variables might override the expected configuration.\n\n6. **Django Version Compatibility:**\n   - Although you are using Django 1.9.2, which is quite old, compatibility issues might arise. If possible, consider upgrading to a newer version of Django, as older versions may have unresolved bugs or compatibility issues.\n\n7. **Check Middleware and Third-Party Apps:**\n   - Review any middleware or third-party apps you are using. Some might interact with the database connection settings and override the timezone configuration.\n\nOnce you have verified and adjusted these settings, restart your server and test if the issue persists. If the problem continues, consider enabling more verbose logging for your database connection to gain further insights into what might be altering the expected configuration."
