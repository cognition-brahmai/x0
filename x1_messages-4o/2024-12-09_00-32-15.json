I need to calculate the ratio 'a / b' but the division operation keeps rounding down to 0 due to integer division, resulting in a remainder of 'a'. How can I manipulate this operation to yield a floating point number instead? Here's what I have so far:\n```python\nc = a / b\n```"

        "content": "In Python 2, when you divide two integers using the `/` operator, it performs integer division and rounds down to the nearest integer. To get a floating-point result, you can convert either `a` or `b` (or both) to a float before performing the division. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nc = float(a) / b\n```\nor\n\n```python\nc = a / float(b)\n```\n\nBoth of these will result in `c` being a floating-point number, allowing you to get the precise ratio of `a` to `b`. Alternatively, you can convert both `a` and `b` to floats, but converting just one of them is sufficient to get a floating-point result."
