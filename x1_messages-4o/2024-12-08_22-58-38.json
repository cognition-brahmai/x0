You must navigate through a maze while avoiding traps and solving puzzles to reach the treasure. Here are the clues to follow:\n1. Identify the specific location of the artifact based on the clues given.\n2. Assess the potential dangers of the traps and design a path that avoids them.\n3. Solve the puzzles along the way to unlock doors and gain access to new areas.\n4. Thoroughly examine each room and search for hidden clues.\n5. Incorporate feedback from your team members and adjust your approach as needed.\n6. Retrieve the artifact and safely make your way out of the maze.\nAs an example, consider a puzzle where you must rearrange letters to form a word. You can use logic and deduction to determine the correct order, while leaving the other letters untouched. By doing so, you can ensure that the puzzle is solved without disrupting the integrity of the original word."

        "content": "Let's tackle this riddle step by step, as a treasure hunt exercise:\n\n1. **Identify the Specific Location of the Artifact:**\n   - Start by gathering all available clues about the maze. These could be maps, symbols, or instructions found at the entrance or provided by your team.\n   - Look for patterns in the clues that might indicate the location of the artifact. For example, if there's a sequence of numbers or a set of coordinates, use them to pinpoint a specific spot within the maze.\n\n2. **Assess the Potential Dangers of the Traps:**\n   - Before entering the maze, gather information about known traps. These might include pressure plates, false doors, or hidden pits.\n   - Design a path that minimizes risk. This could involve avoiding certain areas or preparing tools to disable traps.\n\n3. **Solve the Puzzles Along the Way:**\n   - As you encounter puzzles, carefully analyze them to understand the rules and objectives. These could be word puzzles, logic puzzles, or mechanical puzzles.\n   - Use logic, deduction, and sometimes intuition to solve them. For example, with letter rearrangement puzzles, identify key letters that must remain in place, then rearrange the others systematically.\n\n4. **Thoroughly Examine Each Room:**\n   - In each room of the maze, conduct a meticulous search for hidden clues. Look for anything out of place, such as loose tiles, unusual markings, or hidden compartments.\n\n5. **Incorporate Feedback from Your Team:**\n   - Communicate with team members regularly to share findings and insights. They might notice details you missed or suggest alternative strategies.\n   - Be flexible and willing to adjust your approach based on new information or suggestions.\n\n6. **Retrieve the Artifact and Safely Exit:**\n   - Once you locate the artifact, ensure it's safe to retrieve by checking for traps or alarms.\n   - Plan a quick and secure exit route, avoiding areas you know to be dangerous.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively navigate the maze, solve its challenges, and secure the treasure while keeping you and your team safe."
