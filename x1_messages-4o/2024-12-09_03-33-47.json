I've been following an exercise from this link: http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jvns/pandas-cookbook/blob/v0.1/cookbook/Chapter%201%20-%20Reading%20from%20a%20CSV.ipynb. However, I'm encountering an issue where the plot at 1.3 doesn't appear when I run the code in Jupyter. Instead, I'm only getting the output: \"matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x8ad24a8\". Interestingly, it does appear when I run the same code in Spyder. Here is the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\nfixed_df = pd.read_csv('bikes.csv', sep=';', encoding='latin1', parse_dates=['Date'], dayfirst=True, index_col='Date')\nfixed_df['Berri1'].plot()\n```\n\nWhy is this error occurring and how can I solve it?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is likely related to how Jupyter Notebook handles inline plotting with Matplotlib. By default, Jupyter Notebook should display plots inline, but sometimes this needs to be explicitly enabled. Here's how you can solve the issue:\n\n1. **Enable Inline Plotting**: Ensure that Jupyter Notebook is set to display plots inline by adding the following magic command at the beginning of your notebook:\n\n   ```python\n   %matplotlib inline\n   ```\n\n   Place this line right after your imports, like so:\n\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n   import os\n   %matplotlib inline\n\n   fixed_df = pd.read_csv('bikes.csv', sep=';', encoding='latin1', parse_dates=['Date'], dayfirst=True, index_col='Date')\n   fixed_df['Berri1'].plot()\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Matplotlib Version**: Sometimes, version conflicts between libraries can cause unexpected behavior. Make sure you have a compatible version of Matplotlib installed. You can check the version by running:\n\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib\n   print(matplotlib.__version__)\n   ```\n\n   If needed, you can update Matplotlib using:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade matplotlib\n   ```\n\n3. **Restart Jupyter Kernel**: If the above steps do not resolve the issue, try restarting the Jupyter Notebook kernel and running all the cells again.\n\nThese steps should help in making the plot appear in your Jupyter Notebook. If the problem persists, ensure that there are no errors in earlier cells that might prevent the notebook from running correctly."
