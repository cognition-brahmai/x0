For instance, if I have the following models:\n\n```python\nclass Foo(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField()\n\nclass FooTwo(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField()\n    foo = models.ForeignKey(Foo)\n```\n\nI want to change 'Foo' to 'Bar' while ignoring the 'foo' member in 'FooTwo' for now. I've considered doing a data migration or writing a custom migration, such as `db.rename_table('city_citystate', 'geo_citystate')`, but I'm unsure how to fix the foreign key in these cases. Is there an easier method?"

        "content": "Renaming a model in Django using South involves a few steps. South, which is now obsolete and replaced by Django's built-in migration framework, was used for database schema migrations in older versions of Django. However, if you're still using South, here's a step-by-step guide on how to rename a model and handle foreign keys:\n\n### Step 1: Rename the Model\n\nFirst, you need to rename the model in your `models.py` file.\n\n```python\nclass Bar(models.Model):  # Renamed from Foo to Bar\n    name = models.CharField()\n\nclass FooTwo(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField()\n    foo = models.ForeignKey('Bar')  # Update the reference to the new model name\n```\n\n### Step 2: Create a New Migration\n\nRun the following command to create a new migration file:\n\n```bash\npython manage.py schemamigration yourappname --auto\n```\n\n### Step 3: Edit the Migration File\n\nSouth won't automatically detect table renames, so you'll need to manually edit the migration file it generates. Open the new migration file in `migrations` folder and modify it as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom south.db import db\nfrom south.v2 import SchemaMigration\n\n\nclass Migration(SchemaMigration):\n\n    def forwards(self, orm):\n        # Rename table for the model 'Foo' to 'Bar'\n        db.rename_table('yourappname_foo', 'yourappname_bar')\n\n        # If there are any ForeignKey references, rename those columns as well\n        db.rename_column('yourappname_footwo', 'foo_id', 'bar_id')\n\n    def backwards(self, orm):\n        # Revert the table name change\n        db.rename_table('yourappname_bar', 'yourappname_foo')\n\n        # Revert the ForeignKey reference changes\n        db.rename_column('yourappname_footwo', 'bar_id', 'foo_id')\n\n    models = {\n        'yourappname.bar': {\n            'Meta': {'object_name': 'Bar'},\n            'id': ('django.db.models.fields.AutoField', [], {'primary_key': 'True'}),\n            'name': ('django.db.models.fields.CharField', [], {'max_length': '100'}),\n        },\n        'yourappname.footwo': {\n            'Meta': {'object_name': 'FooTwo'},\n            'foo': ('django.db.models.fields.related.ForeignKey', [], {'to': \"orm['yourappname.Bar']\"}),\n            'id': ('django.db.models.fields.AutoField', [], {'primary_key': 'True'}),\n            'name': ('django.db.models.fields.CharField', [], {'max_length': '100'}),\n        },\n    }\n\n    complete_apps = ['yourappname']\n```\n\n### Step 4: Apply the Migration\n\nNow, apply the migration with the following command:\n\n```bash\npython manage.py migrate yourappname\n```\n\n### Notes:\n\n- Always back up your database before running migrations.\n- If you have other references to the old model name in your code, make sure to update those references as well.\n- Consider upgrading to a newer version of Django that includes the built-in migration framework, as it simplifies these kinds of operations significantly.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to rename your model and handle the foreign key references accordingly."
