I have a function defined as follows: \n\n```python\ndef f(*args):\n    print \"Success!\"\n    print args\n```\n\nI tried calling this function in different ways:\n\n1) Passing a mix of positional arguments and an unpacked list, which worked as expected.\n```python\nf(1, *[2])\n# Output:\n# Success!\n# (1, 2)\n```\n\n2) Passing an unpacked list first and then a positional argument, which failed as expected.\n```python\nf(*[2], 1)\n# Output:\n# SyntaxError: only named arguments may follow *expression\n```\n\n3) Passing a generator and then an unpacked list, which also worked as expected.\n```python\nf(1 for x in [1], *[2])\n# Output:\n# Success! \n# (generator object <genexpr> at 0x7effe06bdcd0>, 2)\n```\n\n4) But when I passed an unpacked list first and then a generator, it still worked. I don't understand why this didn't fail like the second case.\n```python\nf(*[2], 1 for x in [1])\n# Output:\n# Success!\n# (generator object <genexpr> at 0x7effe06bdcd0>, 2)\n```\n\nWhy did the last case not fail like the second case?"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is due to differences in how Python handles unpacking and generator expressions in the context of function arguments.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening:\n\n1. **Unpacking with a list**:\n   - When you do `f(1, *[2])`, Python unpacks the list `[2]` and places its elements into the argument list, resulting in `f(1, 2)`.\n   - However, when you try `f(*[2], 1)`, it results in a syntax error because Python expects named arguments (keyword arguments) after an unpacking operation (`*expression`). This is why you get a `SyntaxError`.\n\n2. **Generators**:\n   - When you use a generator expression like `f(1 for x in [1], *[2])`, Python treats `1 for x in [1]` as a single generator object. The generator is passed as a single argument, followed by unpacking the list `[2]`.\n   - In the case `f(*[2], 1 for x in [1])`, Python sees the unpacking of `[2]` and then the generator expression `1 for x in [1]`. The generator expression is treated as a single argument, and since it's not separated by a comma from the unpacked list, it doesn't trigger the syntax rule that applies to subsequent named arguments.\n\nThe key difference is that a generator expression, when used directly as an argument, is treated as a single object as opposed to individual elements being unpacked. This distinction allows the code in the last case to work without raising a syntax error, as Python doesn't enforce the same restriction on generator expressions as it does with unpacked sequences."
