Here's how you can do it using only built-in Python functions:\n\n```python\ndef second_smallest(numbers):\n    if len(numbers) < 2:\n        return None  # Return None if there are fewer than 2 elements\n    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)\n    return sorted_numbers[1]\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [8, 2, 11, 4, 6, 3, 9]\nresult = second_smallest(numbers)\nprint(\"The second smallest element is:\", result)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `second_smallest` that takes a list of numbers as input, sorts the list using the built-in `sorted()` function, and returns the second element from the sorted list (index 1). It also handles the case where the list has fewer than two elements by returning `None`."
