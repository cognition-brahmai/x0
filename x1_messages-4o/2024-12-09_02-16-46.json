Can anyone help me understand why this is happening and how to fix it? Here's the code I'm currently using:\n\n```python\nfor line, row in enumerate(df.itertuples(), 1):\n    if row.Qty:\n        if row.Qty == 1 and row.Price == 10:\n            row.Buy = 1\n```\n\nThe error I get is AttributeError: can't set attribute."

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the way you're trying to update values in a pandas DataFrame while using `itertuples()`. The `itertuples()` method returns namedtuples, which are immutable, meaning you can't directly modify their attributes.\n\nTo update values in a DataFrame, you can use the `loc` method to access and modify the DataFrame directly. Here's how you can adjust your code to update the values:\n\n```python\nfor line, row in enumerate(df.itertuples(), 1):\n    if row.Qty:\n        if row.Qty == 1 and row.Price == 10:\n            df.loc[line - 1, 'Buy'] = 1  # Use `loc` to update the DataFrame directly\n```\n\nIn this code, `line - 1` is used because `itertuples()` returns an index starting from 0, but `enumerate` starts from 1 when you specify the starting point, so you need to adjust for that when using `loc`.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a more pandas-idiomatic approach by using boolean indexing. This is often more efficient and concise:\n\n```python\ndf.loc[(df['Qty'] == 1) & (df['Price'] == 10), 'Buy'] = 1\n```\n\nThis line will update the 'Buy' column for all rows where 'Qty' is 1 and 'Price' is 10, without the need for explicit iteration."
