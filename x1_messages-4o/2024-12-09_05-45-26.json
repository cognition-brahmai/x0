Otherwise, add t to queue\n```\n\nHowever, when I execute the program, the Activity Monitor in OS X shows that only 1 out of the 4 logical cores is at 100% utilization and the others are nearly at 0%. I can't understand why the OS isn't distributing the load among all cores. Am I missing or misunderstanding something about multithreaded execution in Python?"

        "content": "You're encountering a common issue with Python's threading due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). The GIL is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple native threads from executing Python bytecode simultaneously. This can lead to suboptimal CPU core usage when using threads for CPU-bound operations in Python.\n\nHere are a few approaches to improve CPU utilization across multiple cores:\n\n1. **Use the multiprocessing module**: Instead of using threads, switch to using the `multiprocessing` module, which creates separate processes instead of threads. Each process has its own Python interpreter and memory space, so they can run truly concurrently on multiple cores.\n\n   Here's an example using `multiprocessing.Pool`:\n\n   ```python\n   from multiprocessing import Pool\n\n   def process(object):\n       # Your expensive operation here\n       pass\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       with Pool(processes=4) as pool:  # Create a pool with 4 processes\n           pool.map(process, list)\n   ```\n\n2. **Use concurrent.futures with ProcessPoolExecutor**: This is a higher-level interface, which is part of the standard library in Python 3.2 and above. It provides a simple way to perform parallel execution using processes.\n\n   Here's an example using `concurrent.futures`:\n\n   ```python\n   from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor\n\n   def process(object):\n       # Your expensive operation here\n       pass\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:\n           executor.map(process, list)\n   ```\n\n3. **Optimize your code**: Ensure that the expensive operations within your `process()` function are as optimized as possible. Sometimes, the bottleneck might not be the threading model but the efficiency of the code itself.\n\nBy using separate processes, you bypass the GIL and can fully utilize multiple cores for CPU-bound tasks. However, keep in mind that using processes involves some overhead due to inter-process communication and separate memory spaces, but for CPU-bound tasks, this is usually outweighed by the benefit of running on multiple cores."
