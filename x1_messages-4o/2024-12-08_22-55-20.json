For example, using emphasis or blockquotes is common in Markdown. Here's how you can modify the code:\n\n```ruby\nquote = \"The best way to predict the future is to create it\"\nlast_sentence = \"And if you can't create it, at least try to shape it positively.\"\n\n# Combine the quotes and format it in Markdown as a blockquote\nnew_quote = \"> #{quote} #{last_sentence}\"\n\nputs new_quote\n```\n\nThis code wraps the entire quote, including the additional sentence, in a Markdown blockquote by adding a `>` at the beginning. You can also choose to use emphasis or other Markdown features as needed."
