Is this due to older versions of PEP8 using a 120 character limit and PyCharm not updating its PEP8 checker? I'm starting a new Python project and I'm unsure which character limit to use."

        "content": "The difference in the default line length between PyCharm and PEP 8 is primarily a matter of practical convenience versus strict adherence to the standard. PEP 8, the official style guide for Python code, indeed recommends a maximum line length of 79 characters. This guideline is intended to enhance code readability, especially on devices with smaller screens or when viewing multiple files side-by-side.\n\nHowever, many modern development environments and teams have moved towards using a line length of 100 to 120 characters to accommodate wider monitors and to reduce the need for excessive line wrapping, which can sometimes hinder readability and code editing.\n\nPyCharm, as an integrated development environment (IDE), defaults to a 120-character limit as a compromise between strict adherence to PEP 8 and the practicalities of modern software development. This decision reflects a more flexible approach that many developers and teams have adopted, allowing for greater freedom while still maintaining readability.\n\nWhen starting a new Python project, the choice of line length limit depends on several factors:\n\n1. **Team Standards**: If you are working with a team, it's important to align with the team's coding standards. Consistency is key.\n\n2. **Project Requirements**: Some projects might have specific requirements or guidelines that dictate line length.\n\n3. **Personal Preference**: If coding alone, choose a limit that maximizes your efficiency while maintaining code readability.\n\nUltimately, while PEP 8 provides a guideline, the most important aspect is to maintain consistency within your codebase. If you decide to deviate from the standard, it's good practice to document your choice in your project's style guide."
