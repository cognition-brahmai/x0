Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you set this up:\n\n### 1. **Create a Password Change Form**\n\nDjango provides a built-in form to handle password changes, `PasswordChangeForm`. You can use this form in your view.\n\n### 2. **Create a View for Password Change**\n\nYou'll need to create a view that handles the password change logic. This view should check that the user is authenticated and then process the form.\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required\nfrom django.shortcuts import render, redirect\nfrom django.contrib.auth import update_session_auth_hash\nfrom django.contrib.auth.forms import PasswordChangeForm\nfrom django.contrib import messages\n\n@login_required\ndef change_password(request):\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        form = PasswordChangeForm(request.user, request.POST)\n        if form.is_valid():\n            user = form.save()\n            update_session_auth_hash(request, user)  # Important!\n            messages.success(request, 'Your password was successfully updated!')\n            return redirect('change_password')\n        else:\n            messages.error(request, 'Please correct the error below.')\n    else:\n        form = PasswordChangeForm(request.user)\n    return render(request, 'change_password.html', {'form': form})\n```\n\n### 3. **Create a Template for Password Change**\n\nCreate a template named `change_password.html` to render the form. Here's a basic example:\n\n```html\n{% extends \"base_generic.html\" %}\n\n{% block content %}\n  <h2>Change password</h2>\n  <form method=\"post\">\n    {% csrf_token %}\n    {{ form.as_p }}\n    <button type=\"submit\">Change password</button>\n  </form>\n{% endblock %}\n```\n\n### 4. **Update URLs**\n\nAdd a URL pattern to your `urls.py` file to map to your password change view.\n\n```python\nfrom django.urls import path\nfrom . import views\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    path('change-password/', views.change_password, name='change_password'),\n]\n```\n\n### 5. **Ensure User is Authenticated**\n\nMake sure that only authenticated users can access the password change view. This is handled by the `@login_required` decorator.\n\n### 6. **Test the Feature**\n\nRun your Django application and navigate to the password change page to ensure everything is working as expected.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Security**: Always use `update_session_auth_hash` after changing the password to prevent the user from being logged out.\n- **Feedback**: Provide feedback to users after a successful password change or if there are errors in the form submission.\n- **Customizing Form**: If you need to customize the password change form, you can subclass `PasswordChangeForm` and override its methods or fields.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to implement a secure and user-friendly password change feature in your Django application."
