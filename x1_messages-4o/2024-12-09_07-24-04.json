        "content": "In Python, there isn't a direct equivalent to Perl's `use strict;` and `use warnings;`, but there are best practices and tools you can use to achieve similar results.\n\n1. **Error Handling and Code Quality:**\n   - **Exceptions:** Python encourages the use of exceptions for error handling. Always use try-except blocks where appropriate to handle potential errors gracefully.\n   - **Code Quality Tools:**\n     - **Pylint:** A tool that checks for errors in Python code, enforces a coding standard, and looks for code smells.\n     - **Flake8:** A tool for enforcing style guide compliance in Python code. It combines three tools: PyFlakes, pycodestyle (formerly known as PEP 8), and Ned Batchelder\u2019s McCabe script.\n\n2. **Code Style:**\n   - **PEP 8:** Follow the PEP 8 style guide to ensure your code is readable and maintainable. It covers topics like indentation, line length, and naming conventions.\n   \n3. **Type Checking:**\n   - **Type Hints:** Use type hints to specify the expected data types of function arguments and return values. This can help with readability and debugging.\n   - **mypy:** A static type checker for Python that can help you find type-related errors in your code.\n\n4. **Linting and Testing:**\n   - **Black:** A code formatter that enforces a consistent style in your codebase.\n   - **pytest/unittest:** Use testing frameworks to write and run tests for your code to catch errors early.\n\nBy combining these tools and practices, you can achieve a level of code safety and quality in Python akin to what `use strict;` and `use warnings;` provide in Perl."
