To convert this match object into a more readable form, you can use the `group()` method, which returns the part of the string where there was a match. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Sample text and pattern\ntext = \"Hello, my name is SensAi.\"\npattern = r\"SensAi\"\n\n# Perform the search\nmatch = re.search(pattern, text)\n\n# Check if a match was found\nif match:\n    # Get the matched string\n    matched_string = match.group()\n    print(\"Matched string:\", matched_string)\nelse:\n    print(\"No match found.\")\n```\n\nIn this example, `match.group()` will return the matched substring \"SensAi\". If you have capturing groups in your pattern, you can also pass a group number to `group()`, like `match.group(1)`, to get the specific group match."
