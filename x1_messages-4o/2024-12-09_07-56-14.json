Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Get the full path of the current file\nfull_path = os.path.abspath(__file__)\n\n# Extract the directory path\ndirectory_path = os.path.dirname(full_path)\n\nprint(directory_path)\n```\n\nThis code will give you the directory path without the filename. The `os.path.dirname` function extracts the directory portion of the given path, so when you pass it the full path of the current file, it returns only the directory path."
