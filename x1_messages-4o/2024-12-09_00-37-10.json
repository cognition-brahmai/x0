However, this requires me to manually input each column name. I also know that I can rename all columns using `df = df.columns['name1','name2','etc']`. But what if I want to rename specific columns, say columns 1 and 3, without mentioning their names and just stating their location? Is there a function or a method to achieve this?"

        "content": "Yes, you can rename specific columns by their index positions without explicitly mentioning their names. You can achieve this by using the `iloc` method to target specific columns by index and then renaming them. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    'A': [1, 2, 3],\n    'B': [4, 5, 6],\n    'C': [7, 8, 9],\n    'D': [10, 11, 12]\n})\n\n# Specify the index positions of the columns you want to rename\ncolumns_to_rename = [1, 3]  # for columns B and D\n\n# New names for the specified columns\nnew_names = ['NewName1', 'NewName3']\n\n# Create a dictionary with current names and new names\nrename_dict = {df.columns[i]: new_names[j] for j, i in enumerate(columns_to_rename)}\n\n# Rename the specified columns\ndf = df.rename(columns=rename_dict)\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nIn this example, columns at index positions 1 and 3 (which correspond to 'B' and 'D') are renamed to 'NewName1' and 'NewName3' respectively. You can adjust the `columns_to_rename` list and `new_names` list to suit your specific needs. This approach allows you to rename columns based on their index positions without needing to know their current names."
