        "content": "To solve this puzzle, let's consider the given information: the surface area and one dimension of a 3D shape. We'll use a cylinder as an example, where we know the surface area and the height of the cylinder, and we want to determine its volume.\n\n### Given:\n- The surface area (SA) of the cylinder.\n- The height (h) of the cylinder.\n\n### Cylinder Surface Area Formula:\nThe surface area \\( SA \\) of a cylinder is given by:\n\\[ SA = 2\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi rh \\]\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the base, and \\( h \\) is the height.\n\n### Volume of a Cylinder:\nThe volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is given by:\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n1. **Express \\( r \\) in terms of \\( SA \\) and \\( h \\):**\n   - From the surface area equation:\n     \\[ SA = 2\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi rh \\]\n   - Rearrange to solve for \\( r \\):\n     \\[ 2\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi rh = SA \\]\n     \\[ 2\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi rh - SA = 0 \\]\n\n   This is a quadratic equation in \\( r \\). We can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n   \\[ ar^2 + br + c = 0 \\]\n   where \\( a = 2\\pi \\), \\( b = 2\\pi h \\), and \\( c = -SA \\).\n\n2. **Apply the Quadratic Formula:**\n   \\[ r = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[ r = \\frac{-2\\pi h \\pm \\sqrt{(2\\pi h)^2 - 4(2\\pi)(-SA)}}{2(2\\pi)} \\]\n   \\[ r = \\frac{-2\\pi h \\pm \\sqrt{4\\pi^2 h^2 + 8\\pi SA}}{4\\pi} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate \\( r \\):**\n   Choose the positive root since the radius cannot be negative:\n   \\[ r = \\frac{-2\\pi h + \\sqrt{4\\pi^2 h^2 + 8\\pi SA}}{4\\pi} \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Volume \\( V \\):**\n   Once \\( r \\) is found, substitute it into the volume formula:\n   \\[ V = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nThis method allows you to calculate the volume of the cylinder using only the given surface area and height."
