For example, when I input the integer `65`, I want the output to be the hexadecimal string representation `'\\x41'`, or when I input `255`, I want the output to be `'\\xff'`. I have attempted to solve this problem using `struct.pack('c', 65)`, however, this method fails when the input is above `9` as it requires a single character string as input."

Here's how you can achieve your goal:\n\n```python\ndef int_to_hex_string(n):\n    if 0 <= n <= 255:\n        return f'\\\\x{n:02x}'\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be an integer between 0 and 255.\")\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(int_to_hex_string(65))   # Output: '\\x41'\nprint(int_to_hex_string(255))  # Output: '\\xff'\n```\n\nIn this function:\n\n- `n:02x` formats the integer `n` as a two-digit hexadecimal number.\n- `\\\\x` is used to represent the escape sequence for a hexadecimal value in a string.\n\nThis ensures that the output is always in the form `'\\xhh'`, where `hh` is the two-digit hexadecimal representation of the integer."
