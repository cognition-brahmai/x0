I've looked up the error and found that it can be caused by a path containing spaces, but that doesn't seem to be the issue here. Am I loading the DLL incorrectly? Or could there be an issue with the DLL itself?"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering, `[Error 193] %1 is not a valid Win32 application`, typically indicates that there's an architecture mismatch between the Python interpreter and the DLL you're trying to load. Here are some steps and considerations to help you troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Architecture Compatibility:**\n   - Ensure that both your Python interpreter and the DLL have the same architecture. If your Python interpreter is 32-bit, the DLL must also be 32-bit. Similarly, if your Python interpreter is 64-bit, the DLL must be 64-bit.\n   - You can check your Python architecture by running the following command in your Python environment:\n     ```python\n     import platform\n     print(platform.architecture())\n     ```\n\n2. **Verify the DLL:**\n   - Make sure the DLL file is not corrupted or incomplete. Try replacing it with a fresh copy if possible.\n\n3. **Correct File Path:**\n   - Ensure the file path to the DLL is correct. Consider using raw strings or escaping backslashes in the path:\n     ```python\n     dsusb = ctypes.WinDLL(r'c:\\python27\\dsusb.dll')\n     ```\n     or\n     ```python\n     dsusb = ctypes.WinDLL('c:\\\\python27\\\\dsusb.dll')\n     ```\n\n4. **Dependencies:**\n   - Check if the DLL has any dependencies that need to be present in the same directory or in your system's PATH. Missing dependencies can also cause loading failures.\n\n5. **Use Dependency Walker:**\n   - You can use a tool like Dependency Walker to inspect the DLL and identify any missing dependencies or architecture mismatches.\n\n6. **Try Another Loading Method:**\n   - If `WinDLL` doesn't work, you might want to try using `ctypes.CDLL` as well, though it's typically used for C-style calling conventions:\n     ```python\n     dsusb = ctypes.CDLL('c:\\\\python27\\\\dsusb.dll')\n     ```\n\n7. **Testing on a Different System:**\n   - If possible, try loading the DLL on a different system with a similar setup to see if the issue persists.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify the root cause of the issue and hopefully resolve the loading error. If none of these steps work, you might need to consult the documentation or source of the DLL for specific loading instructions or constraints."
