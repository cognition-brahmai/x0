I have Python 2.7.11 installed through `brew`, which includes `pip`, `wheel` and `setuptools` by default. However, I'm encountering some issues when I install `virtualenv` according to the official documentation or any other resources. The `virtualenv` executable is not placed in `/usr/local/bin` after `pip` completes its job, so I have to manually create a symbolic link. When I run `virtualenv venv`, it creates a new environment and uses Python 2.7.11 from the `brew` installation, but there's no `pip` inside the `bin` folder. If I run `which pip` with `venv` activated, it returns the global position of `pip` \u2014 `/usr/local/bin/pip`, not `/path/to/venv/bin/pip`. As a result, installing packages inside `venv` uses the global `pip` and installs them to the global `sites-packages`, which contradicts the purpose of a virtual environment. I suspect the issue might be due to having other versions of Python installed on my computer, which I have recently deleted. What could be causing these issues and how do I resolve them?"

        "content": "It sounds like you're experiencing a few issues with your virtual environment setup on Mac OS X El Capitan. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you resolve them:\n\n1. **Ensure Clean Installation**: Since you mentioned having other Python versions installed previously, there might be residual files causing conflicts. Make sure to remove any remnants of old Python installations. You can do this by checking and cleaning up `~/Library/Python`, `/Library/Python`, and `/usr/local/lib/python*` directories.\n\n2. **Reinstall Python via Homebrew**:\n   - Make sure your Homebrew installation is up-to-date:  \n     ```bash\n     brew update\n     ```\n   - Reinstall Python 2.7 to ensure a clean setup:  \n     ```bash\n     brew reinstall python@2\n     ```\n\n3. **Install Virtualenv**:\n   - First, ensure you are using the correct pip associated with the Homebrew Python installation:\n     ```bash\n     /usr/local/opt/python@2/bin/pip install virtualenv\n     ```\n\n4. **Create a Virtual Environment**:\n   - Navigate to the directory where you want your virtual environment and create it:\n     ```bash\n     /usr/local/opt/python@2/bin/virtualenv venv\n     ```\n\n5. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:\n   - Once the virtual environment is created, activate it:\n     ```bash\n     source venv/bin/activate\n     ```\n\n6. **Check Python and Pip**:\n   - After activation, verify that you are using the correct Python and pip:\n     ```bash\n     which python\n     # Should return: /path/to/venv/bin/python\n\n     which pip\n     # Should return: /path/to/venv/bin/pip\n     ```\n\n7. **Install Packages Locally**:\n   - Now, when you install packages, they should be installed in the virtual environment:\n     ```bash\n     pip install <package_name>\n     ```\n\n8. **Resolve Any Remaining Issues**:\n   - If you're still encountering problems, consider checking the `PATH` environment variable to ensure there are no conflicts or incorrect paths being prioritized. You can print the current `PATH` using:\n     ```bash\n     echo $PATH\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to set up a virtual environment correctly with a local `pip` installation that works independently of the global Python environment."
