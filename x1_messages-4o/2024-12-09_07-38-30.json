The code I am working with is as follows:\n\n```\nif [dx, dy] == [1,0]:\n    dx, dy = 0, 1\nif [dx, dy] == 0, 1:\n    dx, dy = -1, 0\nif [dx, dy] == [-1, 0]\n    dx, dy = 0, -1\nif [dx, dy] == [0, -1]:\n    dx, dy = 1, 0\n```\n\nThe code changes between four possible states in a loop: `1,0 -> 0,1 -> -1,0 -> 0,-1` and then back to the first state. Is there a better or more elegant way to write this?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can simplify this series of `if` statements by using a list of tuples to represent the directions and then cycling through them using an index. Here's how you might implement this:\n\n```python\ndirections = [(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)]\ncurrent_direction_index = 0\n\n# Assuming dx and dy are initially set to the first direction\ndx, dy = directions[current_direction_index]\n\n# Function to update the direction\ndef update_direction(dx, dy):\n    global current_direction_index\n    # Find the current index of the direction\n    current_direction_index = directions.index((dx, dy))\n    # Calculate the next index, cycling back to 0 if necessary\n    next_direction_index = (current_direction_index + 1) % len(directions)\n    # Get the new direction\n    return directions[next_direction_index]\n\n# Example usage\ndx, dy = update_direction(dx, dy)  # Move to next direction\n```\n\nThis approach uses a single list to store the possible directions and calculates the next direction by incrementing the index and using the modulo operator to wrap around to the beginning of the list. This makes the code more concise and easier to maintain."
