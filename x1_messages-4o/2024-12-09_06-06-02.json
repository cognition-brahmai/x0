In JavaScript, I can achieve this by using multiple sentences and joining them with a '+' operator. However, when I tried something similar in Python, it didn't work. I have used '\\' to split the long string, but I am not sure if this is the best or the only Pythonic way to do it. Here is my code:\n\n```\nquery = 'SELECT action.descr as \"action\", '\\\n    'role.id as role_id,'\\\n    'role.descr as role'\\\n    'FROM '\\\n    'public.role_action_def,'\\\n    'public.role,'\\\n    'public.record_def, '\\\n    'public.action'\\\n    'WHERE role.id = role_action_def.role_id AND'\\\n    'record_def.id = role_action_def.def_id AND'\\\n    'action.id = role_action_def.action_id AND'\\\n    'role_action_def.account_id = ' + account_id + ' AND'\\\n    'record_def.account_id=' + account_id + ' AND'\\\n    'def_id=' + def_id\n```\nIs there a better way to do this?"

        "content": "Yes, there are several ways to split a long string across multiple lines in Python. The use of backslashes (`\\`) is one way, but it's often considered less clean and can lead to errors if not used carefully. Here are some more Pythonic ways to handle long strings:\n\n### 1. Triple Quotes\nYou can use triple quotes to define a multi-line string. This is very readable, but it will include any whitespace and newlines as part of the string.\n\n```python\nquery = '''SELECT action.descr as \"action\", \n    role.id as role_id,\n    role.descr as role\n    FROM \n    public.role_action_def,\n    public.role,\n    public.record_def, \n    public.action\n    WHERE role.id = role_action_def.role_id AND\n    record_def.id = role_action_def.def_id AND\n    action.id = role_action_def.action_id AND\n    role_action_def.account_id = ''' + account_id + ''' AND\n    record_def.account_id=''' + account_id + ''' AND\n    def_id=''' + def_id\n```\n\n### 2. Implicit String Concatenation\nYou can use implicit string concatenation by placing the string literals inside parentheses.\n\n```python\nquery = (\n    'SELECT action.descr as \"action\", '\n    'role.id as role_id, '\n    'role.descr as role '\n    'FROM '\n    'public.role_action_def, '\n    'public.role, '\n    'public.record_def, '\n    'public.action '\n    'WHERE role.id = role_action_def.role_id AND '\n    'record_def.id = role_action_def.def_id AND '\n    'action.id = role_action_def.action_id AND '\n    'role_action_def.account_id = ' + account_id + ' AND '\n    'record_def.account_id=' + account_id + ' AND '\n    'def_id=' + def_id\n)\n```\n\n### 3. Using `join()` with a List\nThis method is very readable and keeps the SQL formatting clean.\n\n```python\nquery = ' '.join([\n    'SELECT action.descr as \"action\",',\n    'role.id as role_id,',\n    'role.descr as role',\n    'FROM',\n    'public.role_action_def,',\n    'public.role,',\n    'public.record_def,',\n    'public.action',\n    'WHERE role.id = role_action_def.role_id AND',\n    'record_def.id = role_action_def.def_id AND',\n    'action.id = role_action_def.action_id AND',\n    'role_action_def.account_id = ' + account_id + ' AND',\n    'record_def.account_id=' + account_id + ' AND',\n    'def_id=' + def_id\n])\n```\n\nEach of these methods has its own use cases, and you can choose based on your preference for readability and maintainability. The second and third options are generally more Pythonic and avoid issues with trailing spaces or newlines."
