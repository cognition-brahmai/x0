In this instance, I have a class named 'Circle' with no attributes defined as shown below:\n\n```python\nclass Circle():\n    pass\n```\nDespite no attributes, I was able to add an attribute 'radius' to its instance as below:\n\n```python\nmy_circle = Circle()\nmy_circle.radius = 12\n```\nPython didn't raise any 'undefined name error' which I was expecting. Even though Python allows dynamic typing and binding of variables to objects, shouldn't an attribute 'radius' already exist in the 'Circle' class for me to add it to its instance? Why is adding attributes to an already instantiated object allowed?"

        "content": "In Python, the behavior you're observing is due to its dynamic nature and its flexibility in handling objects and their attributes. Here's why adding attributes to an already instantiated object is allowed:\n\n1. **Dynamic Nature of Python**: Python is a dynamically typed language, which means it allows for the dynamic creation of attributes and methods. You can add attributes to instances of a class on the fly without needing to define them within the class beforehand.\n\n2. **Class vs. Instance Attributes**: In Python, a class serves as a blueprint for creating objects (instances). However, attributes don't need to be defined in the class itself. When you create an instance of a class, you're free to add attributes to that instance as needed. These are known as instance attributes.\n\n3. **`pass` Statement**: The `pass` statement in your `Circle` class is a placeholder indicating that the class currently has no methods or attributes defined. Despite this, instances of the class can still be created, and attributes can be directly assigned to these instances.\n\n4. **Flexible Object Model**: Python's object model is highly flexible. You can add, modify, or delete attributes from objects at runtime. This allows for a lot of flexibility but also requires careful handling to ensure that the code remains manageable and understandable.\n\nIn your example, when you do `my_circle.radius = 12`, you're creating a new attribute `radius` specific to the `my_circle` instance. This does not affect other instances of `Circle` unless you explicitly set `radius` for them as well.\n\nThis feature can be very powerful, but it also means that you should be cautious when using it, as dynamically adding attributes can lead to less predictable and harder-to-maintain code if not handled properly. It's often better practice to define expected attributes within the class definition to maintain clarity and consistency."
