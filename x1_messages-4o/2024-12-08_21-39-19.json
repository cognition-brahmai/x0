You want to apply a unique style to all the list items within the nested lists that meet certain criteria. Specifically, you want to style any list item that has an even index within a nested list that is at least three levels deep.\nTo achieve this, you will need to use CSS selectors to target the appropriate list items. Can you come up with the CSS code that will apply the desired styling? Remember, you want to make sure that the styling only applies to list items that meet all the specified criteria. Good luck!"

        "content": "To target list items with even indices within nested unordered lists that are at least three levels deep, you can use a combination of CSS child selectors and the `:nth-child` pseudo-class. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```css\nul ul ul li:nth-child(even) {\n    /* Your custom styling goes here */\n    color: blue; /* Example styling: change text color to blue */\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `ul ul ul` targets any list (`ul`) that is at least three levels deep. Each `ul` represents a level of nesting, so `ul ul ul` targets the third level or deeper.\n- `li:nth-child(even)` targets list items (`li`) that have an even index within the targeted `ul`. The `:nth-child(even)` pseudo-class selects elements with an even index (2, 4, 6, etc.), considering that CSS indices start from 1.\n\n### Example Usage:\nHere's a simple HTML structure that the above CSS would apply to:\n\n```html\n<ul>\n    <li>Item 1\n        <ul>\n            <li>Item 1.1\n                <ul>\n                    <li>Item 1.1.1</li>\n                    <li>Item 1.1.2</li> <!-- This will be styled -->\n                    <li>Item 1.1.3</li>\n                    <li>Item 1.1.4</li> <!-- This will be styled -->\n                </ul>\n            </li>\n            <li>Item 1.2</li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>Item 2</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nIn this example, only the list items \"Item 1.1.2\" and \"Item 1.1.4\" within the third-level `ul` will be styled according to the CSS rule provided. Feel free to adjust the styling as needed!"
