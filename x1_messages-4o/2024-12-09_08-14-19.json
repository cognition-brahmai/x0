When I run the container via the normal CLI using `docker run -v /host_dirpath:/cont_dirpath my_image`, I get the expected output of foo.py printed to stdout. However, when I use the docker-py module in Python, the output is not being captured by the `logs` method. Is there a way to include this output in the Docker container logs so I can read it within Python, or capture this output in some other way from outside the container?"

        "content": "To capture the output of a Python script running inside a Docker container using the `docker-py` module, you can follow these steps to ensure that the output is captured and can be accessed within your Python script:\n\n1. **Set Up the Docker Client:**\n   First, you need to set up the Docker client in your Python script to interact with Docker.\n\n   ```python\n   import docker\n\n   client = docker.from_env()\n   ```\n\n2. **Run the Container:**\n   Use the Docker client to run your container. You can specify the necessary parameters such as the image name, volumes, and command to execute your script inside the container.\n\n   ```python\n   container = client.containers.run(\n       \"my_image\",  # Replace with your image name\n       command=\"python /cont_dirpath/foo.py\",  # Command to run your script\n       volumes={\"/host_dirpath\": {\"bind\": \"/cont_dirpath\", \"mode\": \"rw\"}},\n       detach=True,  # Run in detached mode\n       stdout=True,  # Capture stdout\n       stderr=True   # Capture stderr\n   )\n   ```\n\n3. **Capture the Logs:**\n   After running the container, you can capture the output using the `logs` method. Make sure the container is finished running or read the logs in real-time.\n\n   ```python\n   # Wait for the container to finish\n   container.wait()\n\n   # Fetch the logs\n   logs = container.logs()\n   print(logs.decode('utf-8'))\n   ```\n\n4. **Handle Streamed Logs (Optional):**\n   If you want to capture logs in real-time, you can stream them as the container runs.\n\n   ```python\n   for line in container.logs(stream=True):\n       print(line.decode('utf-8').strip())\n   ```\n\n5. **Clean Up:**\n   Optionally, you can remove the container after you're done to free up resources.\n\n   ```python\n   container.remove()\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to capture the output of your script running inside a Docker container using the `docker-py` module. If you still face issues, ensure that the script is being executed correctly inside the container and that it outputs to stdout."
