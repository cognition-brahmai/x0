I need this to be done in a Linux environment, specifically Debian Jessie, with files located on an SSD with a maximum speed of 240 MB/s. My CPU has 4 cores so multi-threading and multiple processes can be used. I'm working on a Google Cloud n1-standard-4 instance with 15 GB of available memory. The total size of the files is 200 MB. Here are the headers for the first two files and the expected output:\n\nFile 1.csv:\n<pre><code>a,b\n1,2\n</code></pre>\n\nFile 2.csv:\n<pre><code>a,b\n3,4\n</code></pre>\n\nExpected Final out.csv:\n<pre><code>a,b\n1,2\n3,4\n</code></pre>\n\nI have benchmarked several methods including pure python, sed, awk, R data.table, Spark 2, and python pandas. The fastest method according to my benchmarks is pure python. Is there any faster method?"

Here\u2019s an approach using GNU Parallel and `awk`, which can take advantage of your multi-core CPU setup:\n\n1. **Install GNU Parallel** if it\u2019s not already installed:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install parallel\n   ```\n\n2. **Combine the CSV files** efficiently using `awk` and `parallel`. We'll utilize `awk` to handle the headers and `parallel` to speed up the processing:\n\n   ```bash\n   # First, extract the header from the first file\n   head -n 1 File1.csv > Final_out.csv\n\n   # Then, process each file in parallel, skipping the header for all files except the first one\n   ls *.csv | parallel 'tail -n +2 {}' >> Final_out.csv\n   ```\n\nThis approach works by:\n- Extracting the header from the first file and writing it to the output file.\n- Using `parallel` to process each file concurrently, appending their contents to the final output file while skipping the header line for all files except the first one.\n\n**Why this method can be faster:**\n- **Parallelization**: Utilizes all available CPU cores to speed up the processing.\n- **Minimal overhead**: `awk` and `parallel` are lightweight and efficient for this type of task compared to other more heavyweight frameworks like Spark.\n\nThis method should further optimize the speed of combining your CSV files, taking full advantage of your available hardware resources."
