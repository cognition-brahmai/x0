I have attempted to use constructors instead of initializers, but I'm encountering errors when trying to set attributes and read attributes. How do I correctly create a subclass with multiple constructors or initializers? Here is the code I have so far:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nclass C(namedtuple(\"C\", \"x, y\")) :\n    __slots__ = ()\n    def __init__(self, obj) : # Initialize a C instance by copying values from obj\n        self.x = obj.a\n        self.y = obj.b\n    def __init__(self, x, y) : # Initialize a C instance from the parameters\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n\nc = C(1, 2) # raises AttributeError: can't set attribute\n\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nclass C(namedtuple(\"C\", \"x, y\")) :\n    __slots__ = ()\n    def __new__(cls, obj) :\n      self = super(C, cls).__new__(cls, obj.a, obj.b)\n    def __new__(cls, x, y) :\n      self = super(C, cls).__new__(cls, x, y)\n\nc = C(1,2) # constructs an object\nc.x, c.y # raises AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'x'\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is related to how `namedtuple` and class constructors work in Python. A `namedtuple` is an immutable data structure, so you cannot set attributes in the `__init__` method because they are already set by the time `__init__` is called. Instead, you need to override the `__new__` method to customize object creation.\n\nAnother problem is that you cannot have multiple `__new__` or `__init__` methods in the same class with different parameters. Instead, you can use class methods to create alternative constructors.\n\nHere's how you can achieve your goal:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import namedtuple\n\nclass C(namedtuple(\"C\", \"x y\")):\n    __slots__ = ()\n\n    def __new__(cls, x, y):\n        return super(C, cls).__new__(cls, x, y)\n    \n    @classmethod\n    def from_obj(cls, obj):\n        return cls(obj.a, obj.b)\n\n# Create an instance using the main constructor\nc1 = C(1, 2)\nprint(c1.x, c1.y)  # Output: 1 2\n\n# Example object with attributes a and b\nclass Obj:\n    def __init__(self, a, b):\n        self.a = a\n        self.b = b\n\nobj = Obj(3, 4)\n\n# Create an instance using an alternative constructor\nc2 = C.from_obj(obj)\nprint(c2.x, c2.y)  # Output: 3 4\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **`__new__` method**: Use this method to initialize a `namedtuple` instance, since `namedtuple` is immutable and attributes should be set during creation.\n- **Alternative Constructors**: Use `@classmethod` to define alternative constructors, allowing you to create instances from different sources or formats.\n- **Immutable Nature**: Remember that `namedtuple` objects are immutable, so any changes need to be handled through new object creation rather than attribute modification."
