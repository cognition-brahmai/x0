My current code is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport csv\nimport sys\nreader = csv.reader(open(sys.argv[0], \"rb\"))\nfor row in reader:\n    print row\n```\n\nBut when I run it, it outputs the following:\n\n```python\n['import csv']\n['import sys']\n['reader = csv.reader(open(sys.argv[0]', ' \"rb\"))']\n['for row in reader:']\n['    print row']\n```\n\nThis seems to be reading the script file itself. I want to replace `sys.argv[0]` so that it asks for a filename instead of using the script's name. How do I modify this code to prompt me for a filename?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is because `sys.argv[0]` refers to the name of the script itself, which is why it's reading the script file. To prompt the user to enter a filename, you can use the `input()` function to get the filename from the user. Here's the modified code:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\n# Prompt the user to enter the filename\nfilename = input(\"Enter the filename to read from: \")\n\n# Open the file using the provided filename\ntry:\n    with open(filename, \"r\") as file:\n        reader = csv.reader(file)\n        for row in reader:\n            print(row)\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(f\"The file {filename} does not exist. Please check the filename and try again.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **`input()` Function**: This prompts the user to input the filename. The input is stored in the variable `filename`.\n\n2. **`with open()` Statement**: This is used for opening the file. Using `with` ensures that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: A `try-except` block is used to handle cases where the file might not exist (`FileNotFoundError`) or other exceptions that might occur during file operations."
