Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Given string\nstring = \"client:user:username:type:1234567\"\n\n# Use rpartition to split the string at the last occurrence of ':'\nbefore, separator, last_segment = string.rpartition(':')\n\n# last_segment will contain the value after the last ':'\nprint(last_segment)\n```\n\nIn this example, `last_segment` will contain the value `1234567`, which is the segment after the last colon in the string. The `rpartition()` method is particularly useful for this purpose because it efficiently finds the last occurrence of the specified separator."
