But when I try to run my code, I encounter an error saying \"missing 1 required positional argument\". My code is as follows:\n\n```python\nclass DHT:\n    def __init__(self, data):\n        self.data['one'] = '1'\n        self.data['two'] = '2'\n        self.data['three'] = '3'\n    def showData(self):\n        print(self.data)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__': DHT().showData()\n```\nCan someone help me understand why this error is occurring and how to resolve it?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the way you are calling the `DHT` class constructor. In your `__init__` method, you have defined a parameter `data`, but you are not providing it when you create an instance of the `DHT` class in your main block.\n\nHere's how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. You need to pass a dictionary (or any other suitable data structure) when you create an instance of the `DHT` class.\n\n2. You should also ensure that `self.data` is initialized properly within the constructor.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nclass DHT:\n    def __init__(self, data):\n        # Ensure 'data' is initialized as a dictionary\n        self.data = data\n        self.data['one'] = '1'\n        self.data['two'] = '2'\n        self.data['three'] = '3'\n    \n    def showData(self):\n        print(self.data)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Pass an empty dictionary or existing one to the constructor\n    dht_instance = DHT({})\n    dht_instance.showData()\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, an empty dictionary `{}` is passed to the `DHT` constructor. As a result, the `data` variable is properly initialized, and the `showData` method will print the expected output without any errors."
