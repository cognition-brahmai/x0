I want each of these projects to operate independently of each other while sitting in the same namespace. I have two modules and I would like to be able to import them as follows:\n\n```\nfrom org.client.client1 import mod1\nfrom org.common import config\n```\n\nThe modules are separated in the following repositories:\n\nRepository 1:\n\n```\norg_client_client1_mod1/\n  setup.py\n  mod1/\n    __init__.py\n    somefile.py\n```\n\nRepository 2:\n\n```\norg_common_config/\n  setup.py\n  config/\n    __init__.py\n    someotherfile.py\n```\n\nMy Git repositories are already set up as `org_client_client1_mod1` and `org_common_config`. I believe I just need to perform the setup on the packaging and `__init__.py` files. I have the following questions:\n\n1. Which of these should I use in the `__init__.py` file, if any?\n\n```\nfrom pkgutil import extend_path\n__path__ = extend_path(__path__, __name__)\n```\nOr:\n\n```\nimport pkg_resources\npkg_resources.declare_namespace(__name__)\n```\n\n2. In the `setup.py` file, do I still need to add the `namespace_modules` parameter, and if so, would I use `namespace_modules=['org.common']`, or `namespace_modules=['org', 'common']`?\n\n3. Can I forgo all the above by implementing this differently? Is there a simpler or more \"pythonic\" way?"

        "content": "When dealing with namespace packages in Python, especially when you want modules from separate repositories to coexist within the same namespace, there are several approaches you can consider. Let's address your questions one by one:\n\n1. **Namespace Package Declaration (`__init__.py`):**\n\n   For Python 3.5, both `pkgutil` and `pkg_resources` can be used for creating namespace packages, but they have some differences:\n\n   - **`pkgutil`:** This is a straightforward and Pythonic way to declare namespace packages. It's part of the standard library, so it doesn't require additional dependencies. You should use this in your `__init__.py`:\n\n     ```python\n     from pkgutil import extend_path\n     __path__ = extend_path(__path__, __name__)\n     ```\n\n   - **`pkg_resources`:** This is part of `setuptools` and is more common in legacy systems. It requires `setuptools` to be installed. You can use it like this:\n\n     ```python\n     import pkg_resources\n     pkg_resources.declare_namespace(__name__)\n     ```\n\n   For new projects and when using Python 3.5 or later, `pkgutil` is generally recommended due to its simplicity and lack of external dependencies.\n\n2. **`setup.py` Configuration:**\n\n   In your `setup.py`, you'll need to specify the namespace package. For `setuptools`, you should use the `namespace_packages` parameter (not `namespace_modules`, which appears to be a typographical error):\n\n   ```python\n   from setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\n   setup(\n       name='org_client_client1_mod1',\n       version='0.1',\n       packages=find_packages(),\n       namespace_packages=['org'],\n   )\n   ```\n\n   And similarly for the other repository:\n\n   ```python\n   from setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\n   setup(\n       name='org_common_config',\n       version='0.1',\n       packages=find_packages(),\n       namespace_packages=['org'],\n   )\n   ```\n\n   Note that you only need to specify the top-level namespace `'org'` in `namespace_packages`.\n\n3. **Alternative and Simpler Approach:**\n\n   Since Python 3.3, PEP 420 introduced implicit namespace packages, which means you can have namespace packages without needing an `__init__.py` file at all. This requires no special setup in your `setup.py` either. However, not having an `__init__.py` might lead to issues with some tooling or older versions of Python.\n\n   If you don't need compatibility with older tools or Python versions, and you're okay without the `__init__.py`, you could structure your repositories like this:\n\n   - Remove the `__init__.py` files from the namespace directories.\n   - Ensure your `setup.py` does not declare `namespace_packages` at all.\n\n   This approach is cleaner and leverages Python's built-in capabilities for namespace packages, reducing the need for boilerplate code.\n\nIn summary, for Python 3.5 and later, using `pkgutil` is a good choice if you want explicit control with an `__init__.py`. However, if simplicity and leveraging modern Python features are a priority, consider using PEP 420 implicit namespaces by simply omitting the `__init__.py` files."
