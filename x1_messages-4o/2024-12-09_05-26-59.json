        "content": "The \"LinAlgError: Singular matrix\" error is typically encountered in linear algebra computations when a matrix that is expected to be invertible is, in fact, singular or non-invertible. This happens because the determinant of a singular matrix is zero, making it impossible to find its inverse.\n\nIn the context of running the `grangercausalitytests` function, this error can occur due to multicollinearity or perfect collinearity between the variables in your dataset. Here are a few reasons why this might be happening in your code:\n\n1. **Perfect Collinearity**: The two time series you are using, `df1` and `df2`, are perfectly collinear. This is because `df2` is simply a scaled and shifted version of `df1`. As a result, there is perfect multicollinearity, which makes the matrix of the variables (used in the regression calculations within the Granger causality test) singular.\n\n2. **Data Transformations**: Any transformation that leads to identical or linearly dependent columns in your dataset will result in a singular matrix.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the two time series are not perfectly collinear. Here are a few strategies you might try:\n\n- **Add Noise**: Introduce some random noise to one or both of the time series to break the perfect collinearity. For example:\n  ```python\n  noise = np.random.normal(0, 0.1, n)\n  df2 = pd.DataFrame(2 * np.sin(1 + ls) + noise)\n  ```\n\n- **Use Different Functions**: Instead of using similar mathematical functions for both time series, use distinct functions to generate the data.\n\n- **Check for Stationarity**: Ensure that both time series are stationary, as non-stationarity can also lead to computational issues in time series analysis.\n\nHere's what a modified version of your code might look like:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom statsmodels.tsa.stattools import grangercausalitytests\n\nn = 1000\nls = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, n)\n\n# Original time series\ndf1 = pd.DataFrame(np.sin(ls))\n\n# Add noise to the second time series to avoid perfect collinearity\nnoise = np.random.normal(0, 0.1, n)\ndf2 = pd.DataFrame(2 * np.sin(1 + ls) + noise)\n\ndf = pd.concat([df1, df2], axis=1)\n\ndf.plot()\n\n# Run Granger causality tests\ngrangercausalitytests(df, maxlag=20)\n```\n\nBy adding a small amount of noise, you can help prevent the matrix from being singular and thus avoid the \"LinAlgError: Singular matrix\" error."
