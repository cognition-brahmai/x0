The script I have is:\n\n```\ndbb = MySQLdb.connect(host=\"localhost\", \n       user=\"user\", \n       passwd=\"pass\", \n       db=\"database\") \ntry:\n   curb = dbb.cursor()\n   curb.execute (\"UPDATE RadioGroups SET CurrentState=1 WHERE RadioID=11\")\n   print \"Row(s) were updated :\" +  str(curb.rowcount)\n   curb.close()\nexcept MySQLdb.Error, e:\n   print \"query failed&lt;br/&gt;\"\n   print e  \n```\n\nThe script outputs the message \"Row(s) were updated :\" with the correct number of rows which have a `RadioID` of 11. If I change the `RadioID` to another number not present in the table, it says \"Row(s) were updated :0\". However, the database doesn't actually update. The `CurrentState` field just stays the same. If I copy and past the SQL statement into PHPMyAdmin, it works fine. Why is my script not updating the database?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is likely related to the fact that changes made to a MySQL database using a script need to be committed to the database. When you run a SQL statement like `UPDATE` in a script, it's executed within a transaction. If the transaction is not committed, the changes will not be saved to the database.\n\nTo resolve this, you need to add a `commit` statement after executing the `UPDATE` command. Here's how you can modify your script:\n\n```python\nimport MySQLdb\n\ndbb = MySQLdb.connect(host=\"localhost\", \n                      user=\"user\", \n                      passwd=\"pass\", \n                      db=\"database\")\n\ntry:\n    curb = dbb.cursor()\n    curb.execute(\"UPDATE RadioGroups SET CurrentState=1 WHERE RadioID=11\")\n    dbb.commit()  # Commit the transaction to save the changes\n    print(\"Row(s) were updated: \" + str(curb.rowcount))\n    curb.close()\nexcept MySQLdb.Error as e:\n    print(\"Query failed\")\n    print(e)\n    dbb.rollback()  # Rollback in case of error to avoid partial updates\nfinally:\n    dbb.close()  # Ensure the connection is closed\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **`dbb.commit()`**: This command is critical as it finalizes the transaction, ensuring that your changes are saved to the database.\n2. **`dbb.rollback()`**: This ensures that if an error occurs, any partial changes are undone, which helps maintain database integrity.\n3. **Exception Handling**: Using `as e` for exception handling is the correct syntax in Python 2.x and 3.x.\n\nThese changes should ensure that your updates are properly committed to the MySQL database."
