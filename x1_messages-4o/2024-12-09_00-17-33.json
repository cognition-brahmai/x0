I have tried using a for loop to iterate through the keys and print the values of the dictionary at index 0 in my list as follows:\n\n```python\nindex = 0\nfor key in dataList[index]:\n    print(dataList[index][key])\n```\nHowever, I am unsure how to adjust this to work for an unknown number of dictionaries in the list `dataList`."

The outer loop will iterate over each dictionary in the list, and the inner loop will iterate over the keys in each dictionary. Here's how you can adjust your code to handle this:\n\n```python\nfor dictionary in dataList:\n    for key in dictionary:\n        print(dictionary[key])\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- The outer loop `for dictionary in dataList:` iterates over each dictionary in the `dataList`.\n- The inner loop `for key in dictionary:` iterates over each key in the current dictionary.\n- `print(dictionary[key])` prints the value associated with each key in the current dictionary.\n\nThis will work regardless of the number of dictionaries in `dataList`."
