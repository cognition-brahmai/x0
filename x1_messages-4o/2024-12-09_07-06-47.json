        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `pathlib.Path` is designed to be subclassed differently. The `Path` class uses a metaclass and relies on specific internal attributes and methods that are set up during its instantiation process. One of these is the `_flavour` attribute, which is used internally to handle different path conventions (like Windows vs. POSIX).\n\nTo subclass `Path`, you should subclass from one of its concrete classes, such as `PosixPath` or `WindowsPath`, based on the platform.\n\nHere's how you can properly subclass it:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path, PosixPath, WindowsPath\n\n# Choose the correct base class depending on the OS\nif sys.platform == \"win32\":\n    BasePath = WindowsPath\nelse:\n    BasePath = PosixPath\n\nclass PPath(BasePath):\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n\n# Usage\ntest = PPath(\"dir\", \"test.txt\")\nprint(test)\n```\n\nThis approach checks the platform and uses the appropriate subclass of `Path`. This should resolve the errors you're experiencing and allow you to use your `PPath` class as intended."
