The connection to the database is successful only about every third time. Hence, a psycopg2.connect() can take up to 5 minutes before I get a timeout exception. I am currently using the following code for connection to the DB:\n\n```python\n# Connection to the DB\ntry:\n    db = psycopg2.connect(host=dhost, database=ddatabase,\n                          user=duser, password=dpassword)\n    cursor = db.cursor(cursor_factory=psycopg2.extras.DictCursor)\n\nexcept psycopg2.DatabaseError, err:\n    print(str(err))\n    logging.error(str(err))\n    logging.info('program terminated')\n    sys.exit(1)\n```\nHowever, even after adding some timeout for the query, the connection doesn't get established at all. The error I receive is as follows:\n\n```\n2014-12-23 15:03:12,461 - ERROR - could not connect to server: Connection timed out\n    Is the server running on host \"172.20.19.1\" and accepting\n```\n\nIs there a way I can stop the program immediately when the connection couldn't be established?"

        "content": "To handle connection timeouts more effectively and ensure that your program stops immediately when a connection cannot be established, you can set a timeout for the database connection attempt. The `psycopg2` library supports setting a timeout using the `connect_timeout` parameter. This parameter specifies the maximum time, in seconds, to wait for a connection to the database before timing out.\n\nHere's how you can modify your connection code to include a `connect_timeout` parameter:\n\n```python\nimport psycopg2\nimport psycopg2.extras\nimport sys\nimport logging\n\n# Configure logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n\n# Connection parameters\ndhost = \"your_host\"\nddatabase = \"your_database\"\nduser = \"your_user\"\ndpassword = \"your_password\"\n\n# Connection to the DB\ntry:\n    # Set the connect_timeout parameter (e.g., 10 seconds)\n    db = psycopg2.connect(\n        host=dhost,\n        database=ddatabase,\n        user=duser,\n        password=dpassword,\n        connect_timeout=10  # Timeout in seconds\n    )\n    cursor = db.cursor(cursor_factory=psycopg2.extras.DictCursor)\n\nexcept psycopg2.OperationalError as err:\n    print(str(err))\n    logging.error(str(err))\n    logging.info('Program terminated')\n    sys.exit(1)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n1. **`connect_timeout` Parameter**: By adding `connect_timeout=10` (or any other number of seconds you prefer), you limit the time the program waits to establish a connection. If the connection cannot be established within the specified time, it raises an `OperationalError`.\n\n2. **Exception Handling**: Make sure to catch `psycopg2.OperationalError` specifically, which is raised for operational errors like connection timeouts.\n\nThis approach should help your program respond more quickly to connection issues and terminate promptly when the connection cannot be established within the desired timeframe. Adjust the `connect_timeout` value based on your network conditions and requirements."
