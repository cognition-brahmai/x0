        "content": "To obtain the current notebook name in an IPython notebook, you can use a JavaScript approach since IPython doesn't provide a direct built-in method for this. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using JavaScript and Python Integration**: You can execute JavaScript code within a Jupyter notebook to get the notebook name and then pass it back to Python.\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport os\nfrom IPython.display import display, Javascript\n\ndef get_notebook_name():\n    display(Javascript('''IPython.notebook.kernel.execute('notebook_name = \"' + IPython.notebook.notebook_name + '\"')'''))\n\nget_notebook_name()\n\n# Now you can use the variable `notebook_name` in Python\nprint(notebook_name)\n```\n\nThis code snippet will execute JavaScript to retrieve the notebook name and assign it to a Python variable called `notebook_name`.\n\n2. **Using the Notebook Path**: If you're interested in the full path or other metadata, you can access the server API, but it requires more setup and potentially adjusting the server configuration for security reasons.\n\nFor most basic needs, the JavaScript approach should suffice. Note that this approach requires that the notebook interface is available and that the JavaScript can execute, so it might not work in some environments like when running a notebook purely in batch mode or on certain platforms where JavaScript execution is restricted."
