        "content": "To write a dictionary within a dictionary to a YAML file using Python, you can use the `PyYAML` library, which is a popular library for parsing and writing YAML files. First, you need to install the PyYAML library if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install pyyaml\n```\n\nOnce you have PyYAML installed, you can proceed with writing your dictionary to a YAML file using the following code:\n\n```python\nimport yaml\n\n# Your dictionary data\ndata = {\n    'A': 'a',\n    'B': {\n        'C': 'c',\n        'D': 'd',\n        'E': 'e'\n    }\n}\n\n# Writing the data to a YAML file\nwith open('output.yaml', 'w') as file:\n    yaml.dump(data, file, default_flow_style=False, sort_keys=False)\n\nprint(\"Data has been written to output.yaml\")\n```\n\nThis code will create a file named `output.yaml` with the following content:\n\n```yaml\nA: a\nB:\n  C: c\n  D: d\n  E: e\n```\n\nMake sure to specify `default_flow_style=False` to ensure that the output is in block format, which is more human-readable. Also, `sort_keys=False` maintains the order of the dictionary keys as defined."
