I want to extract just the numbers from each cell, where they exist. The DataFrame looks like this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'A':['1a',np.nan,'10a','100b','0b'],\n                   })\ndf\n    A\n0   1a\n1   NaN\n2   10a\n3   100b\n4   0b\n```\n\nThe desired result is:\n\n```python\n    A\n0   1\n1   NaN\n2   10\n3   100\n4   0\n```\n\nI am aware that this can be done using the `str.extract` method in pandas but I'm unsure of how to use it. Could you guide me on how to extract the numbers?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can use the `str.extract` method with a regular expression to extract the numbers from each string in the DataFrame column. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create the DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'A': ['1a', np.nan, '10a', '100b', '0b']})\n\n# Use str.extract with a regular expression to extract numbers\ndf['A'] = df['A'].astype(str).str.extract('(\\d+)')\n\n# Convert the extracted numbers back to numeric, preserving NaN values\ndf['A'] = pd.to_numeric(df['A'])\n\n# Display the updated DataFrame\nprint(df)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **astype(str)**: Converts the column to string type to handle NaN values properly, as NaN is a float.\n2. **str.extract('(\\d+)')**: Uses a regular expression `(\\d+)` to extract one or more digits from each string. The parentheses `()` are used to capture the group of digits.\n3. **pd.to_numeric**: Converts the extracted string numbers back to numeric form, which will convert non-numeric entries (like NaN) automatically.\n\nThe resulting DataFrame will have the numbers extracted from each string in column 'A', with NaN values preserved."
