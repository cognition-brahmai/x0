Currently, I am using the following steps to achieve this:\n\n```python\nTempDF= DF.groupby(by=['ShopName'])['TotalCost'].sum()\nTempDF= TempDF.reset_index() \nNewDF=pd.merge(DF , TempDF, how='inner', on='ShopName')\n```\nHowever, I am sure there is a more native approach within pandas. Can someone suggest a more direct or efficient method?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this more directly within pandas by using the `transform` function, which allows you to perform operations on a group and return an aligned result. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nDF['Earnings'] = DF.groupby('ShopName')['TotalCost'].transform('sum')\n```\n\nThis single line of code will add a new column `Earnings` to your original DataFrame `DF`, where each entry contains the sum of `TotalCost` for the corresponding `ShopName`. This approach is more efficient and concise, as it avoids the need to create temporary DataFrames and perform a merge operation."
