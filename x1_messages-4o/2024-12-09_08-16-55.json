        "content": "The `DistributionNotFound` error you're encountering suggests that there's a mismatch between the version of `pip` that your system expects and the version that's currently installed. This issue can arise when there are dependencies or scripts that explicitly require a specific version of `pip`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Upgrade pip**: First, try upgrading `pip` to a more recent version. Since you're on a very old version, you'll benefit from numerous improvements and bug fixes.\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n   ```\n\n   If `pip` is not recognized, use:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo easy_install -U pip\n   ```\n\n2. **Check pip version**: Verify the installed version of `pip` to ensure the upgrade was successful.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip --version\n   ```\n\n3. **Use Virtual Environments**: It's a good practice to use virtual environments to manage dependencies for different projects. This way, you can isolate dependencies and work with different Python and `pip` versions without affecting the global system.\n\n   Install `virtualenv` if you haven't already:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo pip install virtualenv\n   ```\n\n   Create a new virtual environment and activate it:\n\n   ```bash\n   virtualenv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n   Then, within the virtual environment, install the packages you need:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install gevent-websocket\n   ```\n\n4. **Repair Python Environment**: If upgrading pip doesn't work, consider repairing your Python environment. You can reinstall `setuptools` and `distribute`, which might resolve the `pkg_resources` issue.\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install --reinstall python-setuptools\n   ```\n\n5. **Manual Intervention**: If you still face issues, manually check your `/usr/local/bin/pip` or equivalent script to ensure it points to the correct version of `pip`. You might also need to adjust the `pkg_resources` requirement in that file.\n\n6. **Fallback Installation**: As a last resort, you can download the desired package manually, and install it using:\n\n   ```bash\n   wget <package_url>\n   tar -xzf <package>.tar.gz\n   cd <package>\n   python setup.py install\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `DistributionNotFound` error and successfully install your desired packages."
