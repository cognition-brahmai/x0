I am setting up an interactive console session and I want to make it easier for users to instantiate the class, so I would like to alias the class name to something shorter, like 'C'. Is there a way to do this without using inheritance? The class looks something like this:\n\n```python\nclass MyReallyBigClassNameWhichIHateToType:\n    def __init__(self):\n         &lt;blah&gt;\n    [...]\n```"

        "content": "Yes, you can create an alias for a class in Python by simply assigning the class to a new variable name. This does not involve inheritance, and it's a straightforward way to create a shorter name for easier usage in your interactive console session. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nclass MyReallyBigClassNameWhichIHateToType:\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass  # Replace this with your actual initialization code\n\n# Create an alias\nC = MyReallyBigClassNameWhichIHateToType\n\n# Now you can use 'C' as an alias for 'MyReallyBigClassNameWhichIHateToType'\ninstance = C()\n```\n\nBy doing this, `C` will be an alias for `MyReallyBigClassNameWhichIHateToType`, and you can instantiate your class using `C()` instead of typing out the full class name. This is particularly useful in interactive sessions or scripts where brevity is desired."
