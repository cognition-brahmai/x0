        "content": "To determine if a user is part of a custom group in Django, you can use the `user.groups` attribute, which is a ManyToMany relationship to the `Group` model. You can check if a user belongs to a specific group by using the `filter` or `exists` methods. Here is how you can do it:\n\nFirst, ensure you have imported the necessary models:\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import Group\n```\n\nThen, you can check if a user is part of a specific group like this:\n\n```python\ndef is_user_in_group(user, group_name):\n    return user.groups.filter(name=group_name).exists()\n```\n\nYou can use this function in your views or any other part of your code. Here's an example of how you might use it:\n\n```python\n# Assuming 'request.user' is the user you want to check.\ngroup_name = 'YourCustomGroupName'\nif is_user_in_group(request.user, group_name):\n    # User is in the group\n    print(f\"The user is in the {group_name} group.\")\nelse:\n    # User is not in the group\n    print(f\"The user is not in the {group_name} group.\")\n```\n\nThis approach efficiently checks if the user is a member of the specified group using a query that checks for the existence of the group in the user's group set."
