I'm not able to understand why this is occurring as I am not explicitly deallocating anything. I'm using a 192GB machine and my process reaches around 131GB and stays there for some time before giving the error. I have even set \"ulimit -s unlimited\" before running, but this has not resolved the issue. Can anyone provide insight into why this is happening and how to resolve it?"

        "content": "The error message you're seeing, \"*** glibc detected *** python: double free or corruption (out): 0x00002af5a00cc010 ***\", is indicative of a memory corruption issue. This error can occur for several reasons, but here are some common causes and potential solutions:\n\n1. **Underlying C/C++ Extensions**: If your Python script uses C/C++ extensions or libraries (e.g., via `ctypes` or Cython), the error might be in the C/C++ code rather than the Python code. If you\u2019re using any third-party libraries, ensure they are up-to-date, and check their issue trackers for similar problems.\n\n2. **Python Memory Management**: Python manages memory automatically, but if you are interfacing with C/C++ code, manual memory management issues could arise. Ensure that any memory allocated in C/C++ is correctly managed.\n\n3. **Data Structures**: Examine your data structures to ensure they are being used correctly. Sometimes, improper usage or modification of data structures can lead to memory corruption.\n\n4. **Python Object Lifetimes**: Be cautious with objects that may have complex lifetimes, especially if they interact with external resources. Use context managers (the `with` statement) to handle resources like files and network connections.\n\n5. **Garbage Collection**: Try forcing garbage collection more frequently using the `gc` module to see if it alleviates the problem. This can sometimes help if there are issues with object finalization.\n\n6. **Memory Limits**: Even though you've set `ulimit -s unlimited`, check other limits like `ulimit -m` (max memory) and `ulimit -v` (max virtual memory) to ensure they are not constraining your process.\n\n7. **Profiling and Debugging Tools**:\n    - Use tools like `valgrind` to detect memory management problems.\n    - Use Python's built-in `pdb` or other debugging tools to step through your code and monitor memory usage.\n    - Tools like `memory_profiler` or `tracemalloc` can help identify memory bottlenecks in your Python code.\n\n8. **Simplify the Problem**: Try to isolate the part of the code that causes the error. Start with a smaller subset of your data and gradually increase the size, or use a smaller, synthetic dataset to reproduce the error.\n\n9. **Code Review**: Sometimes a fresh set of eyes can spot issues that you might have missed. Consider having someone else review your code.\n\n10. **Alternative Implementations**: If possible, try using different libraries or algorithms for your task. Sometimes specific implementations have known issues with large datasets.\n\nIf none of these approaches resolve the issue, you might consider reaching out to support channels for any specific libraries you're using or providing more details about your code to get more targeted assistance."
