        "content": "Certainly! The `:=` operator in Python is known as the \"walrus operator.\" It was introduced in Python 3.8 and is used for assignment expressions. This operator allows you to assign a value to a variable as part of an expression. It is particularly useful in situations where you want to both assign and use a value within a larger expression, such as in a loop or a conditional statement.\n\nIn the context of the code snippet you provided, the walrus operator is being used to assign values to variables as part of a sequence of statements. Let's break down each line:\n\n1. `node := root, cost = 0`: \n   - This line uses `:=` to assign `root` to the variable `node`. \n   - The `cost = 0` part is a regular assignment operation, likely intended to initialize the `cost` variable to 0.\n\n2. `frontier := priority queue containing node only`: \n   - Here, the walrus operator assigns a priority queue (which contains only `node`) to the variable `frontier`.\n\n3. `explored := empty set`: \n   - This line uses the walrus operator to assign an empty set to the variable `explored`. \n\nThe walrus operator can make code more concise by reducing the number of lines needed for both assignment and use of a value, but it should be used judiciously to maintain code readability."
