I'm currently using a 'setup.py' install file, where the public dependencies are hosted on PyPI and the private ones are hosted on a server running simplepypi. I've added my dependencies to 'setup.py' and build the package tarball using 'python setup.py sdist'. However, when I install it in an activated virtualenv using 'pip install --verbose path/to/tarball.tar.gz', my private PyPI server isn't mentioned and https://pypi.python.org/simple/ seems to have been queried twice. What am I missing?"

        "content": "To install both public and private dependencies in a private project using `setup.py`, you'll need to ensure that `pip` is directed to both PyPI and your private PyPI server. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n1. **Specify Dependencies in `setup.py`:** List all your dependencies in the `install_requires` parameter within `setup.py`. This includes both public and private packages.\n\n   ```python\n   from setuptools import setup\n\n   setup(\n       name='your_project',\n       version='0.1',\n       packages=['your_package'],\n       install_requires=[\n           'public-package1',\n           'public-package2',\n           'private-package',\n       ],\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. **Configure `pip` to Use Both Repositories:**\n\n   To ensure `pip` looks for packages in both the public and private repositories, you can create a `pip.conf` (Linux/Mac) or `pip.ini` (Windows) file with the necessary configuration.\n\n   - **Linux/Mac:** Create or edit the `~/.pip/pip.conf` file.\n   - **Windows:** Create or edit the `%APPDATA%\\pip\\pip.ini` file.\n\n   Add the following configuration:\n\n   ```ini\n   [global]\n   index-url = https://pypi.org/simple\n   extra-index-url = http://your-private-pypi-server/simple\n   ```\n\n   Replace `http://your-private-pypi-server/simple` with the URL of your private PyPI server.\n\n3. **Authenticate if Necessary:**\n\n   If your private PyPI server requires authentication, you'll need to supply credentials. You can either include them in the URL in `pip.conf` (not recommended for security reasons) or configure them using environment variables or a `.netrc` file. For example, using environment variables:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PIP_INDEX_URL=https://username:password@your-private-pypi-server/simple\n   ```\n\n4. **Install the Package:**\n\n   When you run the `pip install` command, `pip` will now check both the public PyPI and your private PyPI server for dependencies.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --verbose path/to/tarball.tar.gz\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify Installation:**\n\n   After installation, verify that all dependencies, both public and private, were installed correctly.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to configure your setup to install dependencies from both PyPI and your private server seamlessly. If you encounter any issues, ensure that your private server is accessible and that there are no typos or misconfigurations in your URLs."
