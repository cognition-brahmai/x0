I'm not trying to set the value, I just want to use it as a getter. Also, `self.test.location` and `report.test.location` work, as well as `reports.locationx`. The error occurs when I call `len(MyReport.objects.all())`. However, If I name the property as `locationx`, there is no error. Are there any special property definition rules in Django and how can I debug this issue? Here is my model and the stack trace:\n\n```python\nclass MyReport(models.Model):\n    group_id    = models.PositiveIntegerField(blank=False, null=False)\n    test        = models.ForeignKey(Test, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n    owner       = models.ForeignKey(User, editable=False, default=get_current_user, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n\n    user_objects = UserFilterManager()\n\n    @property\n    def location(self):\n        return self.test.location\n```\n\nAnd the error:\n\n```python\nFile \"C:\\Python27\\Lib\\site-packages\\django\\db\\models\\query.py\", line 240, in __len__\n    self._fetch_all()\nFile \"C:\\Python27\\Lib\\site-packages\\django\\db\\models\\query.py\", line 1074, in _fetch_all\n    self._result_cache = list(self.iterator())\nFile \"C:\\Python27\\Lib\\site-packages\\django\\db\\models\\query.py\", line 75, in __iter__\n    setattr(obj, attr_name, row[col_pos])\nAttributeError: can't set attribute\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to Django's ORM trying to set an attribute on your model instance that conflicts with the name of a property method. Here's a breakdown of the issue and how you can resolve it:\n\n### Issue:\n1. **Django's ORM Behavior:**\n   - When Django's ORM fetches objects from the database, it constructs instances of the model class and sets attributes based on the fields defined in the model.\n   - If there is a name conflict between a model field and a property method, Django will try to set the attribute, leading to the \"can't set attribute\" error.\n\n2. **Name Conflict:**\n   - In your case, the error occurs because the name `location` is used for a property method, and Django might be expecting `location` to be a field that can be set when fetching data.\n\n### Why `locationx` Works:\n- By renaming your property to `locationx`, you avoid the conflict because there is no field or underlying database column with the same name.\n\n### Solution:\nTo resolve this issue, you have a few options:\n\n1. **Rename the Property:**\n   - As you've already discovered, renaming the property to something unique like `locationx` avoids the conflict.\n\n2. **Ensure No Name Conflict:**\n   - Double-check that there is no field in your model or related models with the name `location`. If there is, you should use a different name for your property.\n\n3. **Use a Different Name for Property:**\n   - If renaming `location` is not acceptable, consider using a more descriptive name for the property, like `test_location`.\n\n4. **Custom QuerySet Handling:**\n   - If you need to keep the name `location`, you could potentially override the queryset handling to prevent it from trying to set the `location` attribute, though this is usually more complex and not recommended unless necessary.\n\n### Debugging Steps:\n- Check the `Test` model (or any related models) to ensure there's no field named `location`.\n- Review any custom managers or querysets that might be interacting with the `location` attribute.\n- Verify that there are no database columns or annotated fields with the name `location`.\n\nBy addressing the naming conflict as described, you should be able to resolve the error and use the `location` property as intended."
