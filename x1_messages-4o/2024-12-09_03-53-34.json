The structure of my project is as follows:\n```\napp/\n    __init__.py\n    views.py\n    forms.py\n    myFile.py\nrun.py\nconfig.py\n```\nIn views.py, forms.py I am able to use `from config import basedir`. However, I am not able to use the same in myFile.py. I have tried to add `import Flask` and when I make modifications, the Flask web server restarts, but it doesn't indicate that the changes in app/myFile.py have been found, it just restarts. I want to understand what needs to be done to use `from config import basedir` in my python file. I don't find any special configuration in `__init__.py` for forms.py. This is my `__init__.py` file:\n```\nfrom flask import Flask\nfrom config import basedir\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config.from_object('config')\nfrom app import views\n```"

        "content": "In your Flask project, the issue you're encountering is likely related to how Python modules and packages are being imported and how the Flask application is set up to detect changes. Let's walk through resolving the issue of importing `basedir` from `config.py` in `myFile.py`.\n\n### Understanding the Issue\n\n1. **Module Import Path**: When you import modules in Python, the interpreter looks for them in the directories listed in the `sys.path`. By default, the current directory and directories from which the script is run are included. If your `myFile.py` is not being correctly recognized, it might be due to how the import paths are set up.\n\n2. **Flask's Auto-reloader**: Flask's development server automatically reloads itself when code changes are detected. However, it monitors specific files that are directly part of the app structure (such as those imported in `run.py` or `__init__.py`). If `myFile.py` is not directly imported or not part of the app's structure, changes might not be detected.\n\n### Steps to Resolve\n\n1. **Ensure Proper Import Path**: Make sure `myFile.py` is part of the `app` package by confirming its placement. It should be placed within the `app` directory as shown in your structure.\n\n2. **Import `myFile.py` in `__init__.py` or Another File**: To ensure `myFile.py` is recognized as part of the application, import it in your `__init__.py` like you do with `views.py`. This will ensure it's part of the module's namespace and any changes will be detected by Flask's auto-reloader.\n\n   Update `__init__.py` like this:\n\n   ```python\n   from flask import Flask\n   from config import basedir\n\n   app = Flask(__name__)\n   app.config.from_object('config')\n\n   from app import views, myFile  # Ensure myFile is imported\n   ```\n\n3. **Check `sys.path` Configuration**: If you still encounter import issues, you might want to check and modify the `sys.path` in your `myFile.py` to include the root directory of your project:\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   import os\n\n   sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..')))\n   from config import basedir\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify `basedir` Usage**: Ensure that `basedir` is correctly defined in your `config.py` and accessible. This would usually be something like:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   basedir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))\n   ```\n\n5. **Run Flask with Debug Mode**: Ensure you are running Flask with debug mode on so it automatically reloads the server on changes:\n\n   ```bash\n   export FLASK_APP=run.py\n   export FLASK_ENV=development\n   flask run\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to import `basedir` from `config.py` into `myFile.py` effectively, and Flask should recognize changes in `myFile.py`."
