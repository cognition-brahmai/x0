        "content": "Certainly! Being aware of lesser-known fire hazards can significantly enhance home safety. Here are five such hazards and ways to prevent them:\n\n1. **Dust Buildup in Electrical Outlets and Appliances:**\n   - **Hazard:** Dust accumulation in and around electrical outlets, power strips, and appliances can ignite due to heat buildup or sparks.\n   - **Prevention:** Regularly clean electrical outlets, power strips, and the areas behind appliances. Use a vacuum or a soft brush to remove dust and ensure there is no clutter around these areas that could ignite.\n\n2. **Overloaded Power Strips and Extension Cords:**\n   - **Hazard:** Plugging too many devices into a single power strip or extension cord can cause overheating and lead to fires.\n   - **Prevention:** Avoid overloading power strips by adhering to their wattage limits. Use surge protectors and ensure that high-wattage appliances, like space heaters, are plugged directly into wall outlets.\n\n3. **Unattended Charging Devices:**\n   - **Hazard:** Devices such as phones, tablets, and laptops can overheat and potentially catch fire if left charging unattended, especially on flammable surfaces.\n   - **Prevention:** Charge devices on non-flammable surfaces like countertops and avoid charging them overnight or when you\u2019re not home. Use chargers that are certified by the device manufacturer.\n\n4. **Clogged Dryer Vents:**\n   - **Hazard:** Lint buildup in dryer vents can restrict airflow, causing the dryer to overheat and potentially ignite a fire.\n   - **Prevention:** Clean the lint filter after every load and inspect the dryer vent system regularly. Ideally, clean the entire vent system at least once a year or hire a professional to do so.\n\n5. **Flammable Items Near Heat Sources:**\n   - **Hazard:** Items such as curtains, furniture, and papers placed too close to heaters, stoves, or fireplaces can catch fire.\n   - **Prevention:** Keep flammable materials at least three feet away from heat sources. Use fire-resistant materials for curtains and furniture near these areas, and always supervise active fireplaces or stoves.\n\nRegular maintenance and vigilance are key to preventing these hazards. It's also beneficial to have functional smoke detectors and a fire extinguisher readily accessible in your home."
