Although I can get the response codes with async.map(rs), I am struggling to retrieve the content of each requested page. When I try out = async.map(rs) followed by print out[0].content, it doesn't work. How can I solve this issue?"

        "content": "The `requests` library in Python is synchronous by default and does not support asynchronous requests directly. However, you can achieve asynchronous requests using the `requests` library along with `concurrent.futures` or by using an external library like `aiohttp` for true asynchronous HTTP requests.\n\nIf you want to stick with `requests` and achieve something similar to asynchronous behavior, you can use `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` to make concurrent requests. Here's an example of how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor\n\n# Function to fetch content from a URL\ndef fetch_content(url):\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        return response.content\n    except Exception as e:\n        return f\"Error: {e}\"\n\n# List of URLs to fetch\nurls = [\n    'https://example.com',\n    'https://example.org',\n    # Add more URLs as needed\n]\n\n# Using ThreadPoolExecutor to fetch content concurrently\nwith ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n    results = list(executor.map(fetch_content, urls))\n\n# Print the content of each page\nfor i, content in enumerate(results):\n    print(f\"Content of URL {i+1}:\")\n    print(content)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*50 + \"\\n\")\n```\n\nThis approach uses a thread pool to make multiple requests at the same time and retrieves the content of each requested page.\n\nAlternatively, for true asynchronous requests, you can use the `aiohttp` library, which is designed for asynchronous HTTP requests. Here's how you can do it with `aiohttp`:\n\n```python\nimport aiohttp\nimport asyncio\n\n# Function to fetch content from a URL asynchronously\nasync def fetch_content(session, url):\n    try:\n        async with session.get(url) as response:\n            return await response.text()\n    except Exception as e:\n        return f\"Error: {e}\"\n\n# Main asynchronous function to handle the requests\nasync def main(urls):\n    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n        tasks = [fetch_content(session, url) for url in urls]\n        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\n        return results\n\n# List of URLs to fetch\nurls = [\n    'https://example.com',\n    'https://example.org',\n    # Add more URLs as needed\n]\n\n# Run the main function and get results\nresults = asyncio.run(main(urls))\n\n# Print the content of each page\nfor i, content in enumerate(results):\n    print(f\"Content of URL {i+1}:\")\n    print(content)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*50 + \"\\n\")\n```\n\nBy using `aiohttp`, you get the benefits of asynchronous programming, which can be more efficient when dealing with a large number of requests."
