        "content": "To sort an array of numbers in Java, you can use several approaches, but one of the most efficient and straightforward methods is to use the built-in `Arrays.sort()` method, which uses a Dual-Pivot Quicksort algorithm for primitive types. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n\npublic class SortArrayExample {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Example array of numbers\n        int[] numbers = {5, 3, 8, 1, 2, 7};\n\n        // Using Arrays.sort() to sort the array\n        Arrays.sort(numbers);\n\n        // Printing the sorted array\n        System.out.println(\"Sorted array: \" + Arrays.toString(numbers));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Import `Arrays` Class**: The `Arrays` class contains a static method `sort()` that efficiently sorts the specified array of numbers.\n  \n- **Arrays.sort() Method**: This method sorts the array in ascending order. For primitive types like `int`, it uses a Dual-Pivot Quicksort algorithm which is very efficient in terms of average time complexity, O(n log n).\n\n- **Print the Array**: Use `Arrays.toString()` to print the sorted array.\n\n### Alternative Methods:\n\n1. **Custom Sorting Algorithms**: If you want to implement sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, or Quick Sort manually, you can do so, but they are generally used for educational purposes rather than practical applications because `Arrays.sort()` is highly optimized.\n\n2. **Streams API**: For more modern Java applications, you can also use Java Streams to sort arrays:\n\n   ```java\n   int[] numbers = {5, 3, 8, 1, 2, 7};\n   numbers = Arrays.stream(numbers).sorted().toArray();\n   System.out.println(\"Sorted array: \" + Arrays.toString(numbers));\n   ```\n\nThis uses the `sorted()` method of the Stream API, which also sorts the elements in ascending order.\n\nUsing the built-in `Arrays.sort()` is typically the best practice, as it is optimized and easy to use."
