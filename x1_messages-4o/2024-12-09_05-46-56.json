        "content": "The error you're encountering indicates that TensorFlow is unable to find the 'cusolver64_10.dll' file, which is part of NVIDIA's CUDA Toolkit. This typically means that either the CUDA Toolkit is not installed properly, or the version installed is not compatible with the version of TensorFlow you're using. Here\u2019s how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check TensorFlow Version Compatibility:**\n   - Ensure that the version of CUDA and cuDNN installed on your system is compatible with the version of TensorFlow you are using. You can refer to the official TensorFlow documentation to check compatibility.\n\n2. **Install or Update CUDA Toolkit:**\n   - Download and install the appropriate version of the CUDA Toolkit from NVIDIA's official website. Make sure to select the version that matches your TensorFlow version's requirements.\n\n3. **Install cuDNN:**\n   - Similarly, download and install the appropriate version of cuDNN from NVIDIA's developer website. You will need to register for an account if you don't already have one.\n\n4. **Set Environment Variables:**\n   - Ensure that the environment variables are set correctly. You should have `CUDA_HOME` and `CUDA_PATH` pointing to the CUDA installation directory. Also, ensure that the `PATH` environment variable includes the directories where CUDA and cuDNN DLLs are located.\n\n5. **Verify Installation:**\n   - After installation, verify that CUDA is installed correctly by running the `nvcc --version` command in your command prompt or terminal. This should display the version of CUDA installed.\n\n6. **Check DLL Files:**\n   - Ensure that the specific 'cusolver64_10.dll' file is present in the CUDA installation directory under `bin`. If not, reinstall CUDA.\n\n7. **Reinstall TensorFlow:**\n   - Sometimes, reinstalling TensorFlow can help resolve such issues, especially if there was a problem during the initial installation.\n\n8. **Use Conda Environment (Optional):**\n   - If you're not using it already, consider using a conda environment, which can simplify the management of dependencies and versions. You can create a new environment with specific versions of TensorFlow, CUDA, and cuDNN.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and get TensorFlow to recognize your GPU properly."
