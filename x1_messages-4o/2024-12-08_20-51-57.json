I wandered lonely as a cloud\nThat floats on high o'er vales and hills,\nWhen all at once I saw a crowd,\nA host, of golden daffodils\n\nII. Flinging ecstatic mirth\nIn the hollows of my mind,\nMy heart will bless the happy earth\nFor the beautiful sweet dream I find\n\nIII. In the village church yard\nShe stands; in her rue-brown guize,\nWith the clay-cold turf of the buri'd dead\nUnder neath her feet so wise\n\nIV. Stay, stay at home, my heart, and rest;\n Home-keeping hearts are happiest,\n For those that wander they know not\n Where they shall find a more blest"
