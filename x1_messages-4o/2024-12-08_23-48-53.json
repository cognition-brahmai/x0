        "content": "In Ruby, you can generate a unique random number between 0 and 1 using the `rand` method. The `rand` method, when called without any arguments or with a single argument `1`, will return a floating-point number greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0. Here\u2019s a simple example:\n\n```ruby\nrandom_number = rand\nputs random_number\n```\n\nThis will output a random floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0. If you need this number to be unique in a broader context (like across multiple runs or instances), you'll need to manage that uniqueness in your application logic, ensuring that it hasn't been generated or used before. However, for most purposes, using `rand` as shown above will suffice for generating a random number in the specified range each time it is called."
