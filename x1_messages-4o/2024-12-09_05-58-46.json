The commands I am using are 'setenv FOO foo' in csh/tcsh and 'export FOO=foo' in sh/bash. However, these only seem to set the variables during the script's execution. If I use 'source myscript', it will run the commands of the script rather than launching a new shell, which can set the caller's environment. However, I want this script to be usable from either bash or csh. I don't want to write and maintain two versions of the script for different shells. Is there a way to achieve this?"

        "content": "To modify the environment variables of the calling shell from a script, you indeed need to have the script run in the context of the calling shell. This is typically achieved by sourcing the script, as you've already mentioned. Sourcing ensures that the script's commands are executed in the current shell rather than a subshell, allowing changes to environment variables to persist after the script finishes.\n\nSince you want to use the same script with both `bash` and `csh`/`tcsh`, you can design your script to detect the shell it's being sourced in and then use the appropriate commands to set environment variables. Here's a way to achieve this:\n\n1. **Script Setup:** Create a script that can determine the shell being used and then execute the appropriate export or setenv command.\n\n2. **Unified Script Example:**\n\n   ```shell\n   #!/bin/bash\n\n   # Check for the shell type\n   if [ -n \"$BASH_VERSION\" ]; then\n       # This is bash\n       export FOO=\"foo\"\n   elif [ -n \"$ZSH_VERSION\" ]; then\n       # This is zsh\n       export FOO=\"foo\"\n   elif [ -n \"$CSH_VERSION\" ] || [ -n \"$TCSH_VERSION\" ]; then\n       # This is csh or tcsh\n       setenv FOO foo\n   else\n       echo \"Unsupported shell\"\n   fi\n   ```\n\n3. **Usage:**\n   - For `bash` or `zsh`, source the script using: `. myscript` or `source myscript`\n   - For `csh` or `tcsh`, source the script using: `source myscript`\n\nBy using conditionals within the script to check the shell type, you can maintain a single script for both shell environments. Just remember that the script must be sourced, not executed, to modify the environment of the calling shell."
