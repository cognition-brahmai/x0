        "content": "Calculating the variance of a list in Python is fairly straightforward. The variance is indeed the average of the squared differences from the mean. Here's a step-by-step guide to calculate the variance of your list using Python:\n\n1. **Calculate the mean** of the list.\n2. **Compute the squared differences** from the mean for each element in the list.\n3. **Calculate the average** of these squared differences.\n\nHere's how you can do it in Python:\n\n```python\n# Your list of results\nresults = [-14.82381293, -0.29423447, -13.56067979, -1.6288903, -0.31632439,\n           0.53459687, -1.34069996, -1.61042692, -4.03220519, -0.24332097]\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the mean\nmean_result = sum(results) / len(results)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the squared differences from the mean\nsquared_diffs = [(x - mean_result) ** 2 for x in results]\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the variance (average of squared differences)\nvariance = sum(squared_diffs) / len(squared_diffs)\n\nprint(\"Variance:\", variance)\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `statistics` module in Python, which has a built-in function to calculate variance:\n\n```python\nimport statistics\n\n# Calculate variance using the statistics module\nvariance = statistics.variance(results)\n\nprint(\"Variance:\", variance)\n```\n\nNote that the `statistics.variance()` function calculates the sample variance by default. If you need the population variance, you should use `statistics.pvariance()` instead.\n\nThis should give you the variance of your list of numbers."
