        "content": "When you use the `import` statement in Python, the interpreter follows a specific search path to locate the module you're trying to import. Here's how Python locates a module file:\n\n1. **Built-in Modules**: First, Python checks if the module is a built-in module, such as `sys`. These are modules that are compiled into the Python interpreter itself and are always available.\n\n2. **Current Directory**: If the module is not built-in, Python checks the current working directory from where the script is being executed. If there's a file with the module name and a `.py` extension, it will be imported.\n\n3. **PYTHONPATH Environment Variable**: Python then checks the directories listed in the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable. This is similar to the system's `PATH` variable but is specific for Python modules. It contains a list of directory paths separated by colons (on Unix-like systems) or semicolons (on Windows).\n\n4. **Standard Library Directories**: After that, Python searches through the directories in the standard library. These directories contain Python's standard modules and are typically located in the `lib` directory within your Python installation.\n\n5. **Site-packages Directories**: Lastly, Python looks in the `site-packages` directories. These directories hold third-party packages and modules installed via package management tools like `pip`.\n\nThe search path described above is stored in the `sys.path` variable. You can print `sys.path` to see the exact order of directories Python will check for modules during an import.\n\nIf Python cannot find the module in any of these locations, it raises an `ImportError`. You can manage or modify the module search path by altering the `sys.path` list within your script, although this is generally not recommended unless necessary for your specific use case."
