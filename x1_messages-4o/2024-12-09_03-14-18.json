I want to calculate the proportion of women onboard who survived, however, when I divide `sum` by the size of `women_onboard` using `np.size` and print the result, it keeps on outputting 0. How can I convert the integer to a float to get a decimal output? Here is my code:\n\n```python\nsum = 144\nwomen_onboard = 314\nproportion_womenclass3_survived = sum / np.size(women_onboard)\nprint 'Proportion of women in class3 who survived is %s' % proportion_womenclass3_survived\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to integer division in Python 2, which results in an integer output when both operands are integers. To obtain a float result, you need to ensure at least one of the operands is a float. You can do this by converting one of the integers to a float before performing the division. Additionally, ensure you're using the correct syntax for Python 2, such as parentheses for the `print` function.\n\nHere is the modified version of your code:\n\n```python\nsum = 144\nwomen_onboard = 314\n# Convert 'sum' to a float to ensure float division\nproportion_womenclass3_survived = float(sum) / np.size(women_onboard)\nprint('Proportion of women in class3 who survived is %s' % proportion_womenclass3_survived)\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you're using Python 3, integer division would default to float division, so you wouldn't need to explicitly convert to a float. However, since you're using the Python 2 print syntax, it seems like you're working in a Python 2 environment."
