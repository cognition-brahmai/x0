X is located at (2, 5), Y is located at (7, 5), and Z is located at (5, 10). \nYour task is to determine whether the triangle formed by these three points is a right triangle or not. However, you can only use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this puzzle.\nCan you figure out whether this triangle is a right triangle or not? Hint: remember that the Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides."

        "content": "To determine if the triangle formed by the points X(2, 5), Y(7, 5), and Z(5, 10) is a right triangle, we will use the Pythagorean theorem. First, we need to calculate the lengths of each side of the triangle using the distance formula, which is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\]\n\n1. **Distance between X and Y:**\n   \\[\n   XY = \\sqrt{(7 - 2)^2 + (5 - 5)^2} = \\sqrt{5^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{25} = 5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Distance between Y and Z:**\n   \\[\n   YZ = \\sqrt{(5 - 7)^2 + (10 - 5)^2} = \\sqrt{(-2)^2 + 5^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 25} = \\sqrt{29}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Distance between Z and X:**\n   \\[\n   ZX = \\sqrt{(5 - 2)^2 + (10 - 5)^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + 5^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 25} = \\sqrt{34}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we need to check if any of these combinations satisfy the Pythagorean theorem \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\), where \\(c\\) is the longest side (hypotenuse).\n\n- Check if \\(XY^2 + YZ^2 = ZX^2\\):\n  \\[\n  5^2 + \\sqrt{29}^2 = \\sqrt{34}^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 25 + 29 = 34 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 54 \\neq 34\n  \\]\n\n- Check if \\(YZ^2 + ZX^2 = XY^2\\):\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{29}^2 + \\sqrt{34}^2 = 5^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 29 + 34 = 25 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 63 \\neq 25\n  \\]\n\n- Check if \\(ZX^2 + XY^2 = YZ^2\\):\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{34}^2 + 5^2 = \\sqrt{29}^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 34 + 25 = 29 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 59 \\neq 29\n  \\]\n\nSince none of these combinations satisfy the Pythagorean theorem, the triangle formed by points X, Y, and Z is not a right triangle."
