Currently, I am using the following code block:\n\n```python\nimport time\nstart_time = time.time()\n\n# my code here\n\nprint \"time elapsed: {:.2f}s\".format(time.time() - start_time)\n```\n\nIs there a way to achieve this either by modifying the run configuration or by using a plugin?"

        "content": "In PyCharm, you can measure the execution time of a script without modifying the script itself by using the built-in profiler or by utilizing external tools or plugins. Here are a few ways to achieve this:\n\n1. **Use PyCharm's Profiler**:\n   - PyCharm Professional Edition includes a built-in profiler that you can use to measure the execution time and performance of your script.\n   - To use the profiler, right-click on the script you want to profile in the Project view or open it in the editor. Then, select \"Profile\" from the context menu. This will run the script and provide a detailed report on execution times, including function call times and more.\n\n2. **Use Command-Line Time Measurement**:\n   - If you are comfortable using the command line, you can measure the execution time by running your script from the terminal with the `time` command:\n     ```bash\n     time python your_script.py\n     ```\n   - This will give you the real, user, and sys time taken by the script.\n\n3. **Use External Plugins**:\n   - PyCharm supports various plugins that can help with measuring execution time. One such plugin is the \"Code Time\" plugin, which tracks how much time you spend in your IDE and can be used to measure execution time indirectly.\n   - To install a plugin, go to `File > Settings > Plugins` (or `PyCharm > Preferences > Plugins` on macOS), search for the plugin you want, and install it.\n\n4. **Custom Run Configuration**:\n   - You can create a custom run configuration that automatically measures execution time by wrapping your script execution in timing code.\n   - Go to `Run > Edit Configurations`, create a new configuration, and set the script to be executed with a wrapper that includes your timing code.\n\nBy using these methods, you can measure the execution time of your scripts in PyCharm without modifying the script itself."
