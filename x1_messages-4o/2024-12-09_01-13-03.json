Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ntup = tuple((element.foo, element.bar) for element in alist)\n```\n\nIn this list comprehension:\n\n- `element` iterates over each item in `alist`.\n- `(element.foo, element.bar)` creates a 2-tuple for each `element`.\n- `tuple(...)` converts the generator expression into a tuple.\n\nThis one-liner is equivalent to the loop you provided and results in the same tuple of 2-tuples."
