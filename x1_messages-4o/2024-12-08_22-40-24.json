        "content": "To evaluate models not only on their performance but also considering their computational complexity, you can use a composite metric that combines traditional performance metrics with a measure of computational efficiency. One such metric is the **Performance-Efficiency Metric (PEM)**, which can be formulated as follows:\n\n1. **Select a Performance Metric**: Choose a performance metric appropriate for your problem domain. For example:\n   - Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, Recall for classification tasks.\n   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression tasks.\n\n2. **Measure Computational Complexity**: This can include factors such as:\n   - **Inference Time**: The time taken by the model to make predictions on a given dataset.\n   - **Memory Usage**: The amount of memory required by the model during inference.\n   - **Number of Parameters**: Total number of parameters in the model which can be a proxy for complexity.\n\n3. **Combine the Metrics**: Create a composite score that balances performance and complexity. For example:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{PEM} = \\frac{\\text{Performance Metric}}{\\text{Complexity Metric}}\n   \\]\n\n   Where the Complexity Metric could be a weighted sum of normalized inference time, memory usage, and number of parameters. The weights can be adjusted based on the relative importance of each component in your context.\n\n4. **Normalization**: Ensure that both performance and complexity metrics are normalized to comparable scales to avoid skewed results.\n\nBy using PEM, you can make informed decisions about which model not only performs well on your dataset but also meets your computational constraints. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where resource efficiency is as critical as model accuracy, such as deploying models on edge devices or in real-time systems."
