I am currently doing this with two separate list comprehension statements: \n\n```python\nlistOfA=[idx for idx,x in enumerate(s) if x=='A']\nlistOfB=[idx for idx,x in enumerate(s) if x=='B']\n```\nIs it possible to achieve the same result in a single statement or iteration using list comprehensions only? I am trying to find a solution that would look something like `listOfA,listOfB=[--code goes here--]`."

        "content": "Yes, it is possible to achieve this using a single iteration with list comprehensions by utilizing a tuple. You can iterate over the list `s` once and append the indices to the appropriate lists based on the value. Here's how you can achieve it:\n\n```python\nlistOfA, listOfB = zip(*[((idx, None) if x == 'A' else (None, idx)) for idx, x in enumerate(s)])\nlistOfA = [i for i in listOfA if i is not None]\nlistOfB = [i for i in listOfB if i is not None]\n```\n\nThis code snippet creates a list of tuples where each tuple contains either `(index, None)` if the element is 'A' or `(None, index)` if the element is 'B'. The `zip(*...)` is used to separate these into two tuples of indices. Then, list comprehensions filter out `None` values to create `listOfA` and `listOfB`."
