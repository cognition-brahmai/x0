When I try to push my code using `git push heroku master`, I encounter an error stating `Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement pkg-resources==0.0.0`. This error originates from the 14th line in my `requirements.txt` file. However, the application works perfectly fine on my local server. Why is it not working on Heroku?\n\nHere is the error I get when I try to push:\n```\nCollecting pkg-resources==0.0.0 (from -r requirements.txt (line 14))\nremote:          Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement pkg-resources==0.0.0 (from -r requirements.txt (line 14)) (from versions: )\nremote:        No matching distribution found for pkg-resources==0.0.0 (from -r requirements.txt (line 14))\nremote:  !     Push rejected, failed to compile Python app.\n```\n\nHere is my `requirements.txt` file:\n\n```\namqp==2.1.1\nbilliard==3.5.0.2\nboto==2.42.0\ncelery==4.0.0\ndj-database-url==0.4.1\nDjango==1.10.2\ndjango-appconf==1.0.2\ndjango-model-utils==2.6\ndjango-storages==1.5.1\ndjangorestframework==3.4.7\ngunicorn==19.6.0\nJinja2==2.8\nkombu==4.0.0\nMarkupSafe==0.23\noptional-django==0.1.0\npep8==1.7.0\npkg-resources==0.0.0\npsycopg2==2.6.2\npyflakes==1.3.0\npytz==2016.7\nrcssmin==1.0.6\nrequests==2.12.1\nrjsmin==1.0.12\nvine==1.1.3\nwhitenoise==3.2.2\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the presence of `pkg-resources==0.0.0` in your `requirements.txt` file. This entry is not a real package and doesn't exist on PyPI, which is why Heroku is unable to find it and install it.\n\nThis entry can sometimes appear in the `requirements.txt` file due to an issue with certain versions of `pip` or when using certain tools to generate the `requirements.txt` file.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Edit the `requirements.txt`:** Open your `requirements.txt` file and remove the line that contains `pkg-resources==0.0.0`.\n\n2. **Re-generate the `requirements.txt` (Optional):** If you want to ensure that your `requirements.txt` is clean and up-to-date, you can re-generate it using the following commands:\n\n   ```bash\n   # First, remove the existing requirements.txt\n   rm requirements.txt\n\n   # Then, create a new requirements.txt with the correct packages\n   pip freeze > requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n3. **Commit the Changes:** After removing the unnecessary line, commit the changes to your repository.\n\n   ```bash\n   git add requirements.txt\n   git commit -m \"Remove pkg-resources from requirements.txt\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Push to Heroku:** Now, try pushing your code to Heroku again.\n\n   ```bash\n   git push heroku master\n   ```\n\nThis should resolve the issue, and your deployment on Heroku should work without any problems. If you encounter any other issues, feel free to ask for further assistance!"
