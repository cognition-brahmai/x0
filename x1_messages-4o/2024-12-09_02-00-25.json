The `printf` command is more versatile than `echo` and can be used to achieve the same result. Here\u2019s how you can use it:\n\n```bash\nprintf \"foo\\n\" >&2\n```\n\nThis command sends the string \"foo\" followed by a newline character to the standard error (stderr). The `printf` command is preferred in scripting for its consistency across different environments and for its ability to handle complex formatting."
