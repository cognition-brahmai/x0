        "content": "To parse a tweet and extract hashtags into an array using Python, you can utilize regular expressions. Here's a simple way to achieve that:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_hashtags(tweet):\n    # Use regular expression to find hashtags in the tweet\n    hashtags = re.findall(r'#\\w+', tweet)\n    return hashtags\n\n# Example usage\ntweet = \"I love #stackoverflow because #people are very #helpful!\"\nhashtags = extract_hashtags(tweet)\nprint(hashtags)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- `re.findall(r'#\\w+', tweet)`: This line uses a regular expression to find all occurrences of words starting with the `#` symbol, which represent hashtags. The pattern `#\\w+` matches a `#` followed by one or more word characters (letters, digits, or underscores).\n\n- The `extract_hashtags` function takes a tweet as input and returns a list of hashtags found within the tweet.\n\nWhen you run the code with the provided example tweet, it will output:\n\n```\n['#stackoverflow', '#people', '#helpful']\n```\n\nThis simple approach should work for most tweets with straightforward hashtag usage. If you need to handle more complex cases (e.g., hashtags with non-word characters or special requirements), you might need to adjust the regular expression accordingly."
