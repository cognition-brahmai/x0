After training the model, I am trying to get the raw feature vector of a particular word, say \"view\", using the following code: `myModel[\"view\"]`. However, I am receiving a KeyError, which I presume is because the word \"view\" does not exist as a key in the list of keys indexed by word2vec. How can I verify if a key exists in the index before trying to retrieve the raw feature vector?"

        "content": "To verify if a key (in this case, a word) exists in your trained Word2Vec model before attempting to retrieve its vector, you can use the `in` keyword to check for the word's presence in the model's vocabulary. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Assuming 'myModel' is your trained Word2Vec model\nword = \"view\"\n\n# Check if the word exists in the model's vocabulary\nif word in myModel.wv:\n    # Get the raw feature vector for the word\n    vector = myModel.wv[word]\n    print(f\"The vector for '{word}' is:\\n{vector}\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"The word '{word}' does not exist in the model's vocabulary.\")\n```\n\nThis method ensures that you only attempt to access the vector for words that are present in the model, thereby avoiding `KeyError`. Note that `myModel.wv` is the part of the model that contains the vocabulary and their corresponding vectors."
