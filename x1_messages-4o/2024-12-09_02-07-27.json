        "content": "I am trying to copy a dictionary in Python. I used the assignment operator to create a copy of the original dictionary, like this: `dict2 = dict1`. However, when I try to modify the copied dictionary `dict2`, the original dictionary `dict1` also gets modified. Here's an example of what I'm doing:\n\n```python\ndict1 = {\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2\"}\ndict2 = dict1\ndict2[\"key2\"] = \"WHY?!\"\nprint(dict1)\n```\n\nThe output is `{'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'WHY?!'}`. Could you explain why this is happening and how I can copy a dictionary so that changes to the copy do not affect the original?"

        "content": "The behavior you're experiencing is due to how Python handles variable assignment. When you use the assignment operator (`=`) to assign `dict2 = dict1`, you are not creating a new copy of the dictionary. Instead, you are creating a new reference to the same dictionary object in memory. This means that any changes made to `dict2` will also reflect in `dict1` because they both point to the same object.\n\nTo create an actual copy of the dictionary that is independent of the original, you can use one of the following methods:\n\n1. **Using the `copy()` method:**\n\n   The `copy()` method creates a shallow copy of the dictionary.\n\n   ```python\n   dict1 = {\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2\"}\n   dict2 = dict1.copy()\n   dict2[\"key2\"] = \"WHY?!\"\n   print(dict1)  # Output: {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}\n   print(dict2)  # Output: {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'WHY?!'}\n   ```\n\n2. **Using the `dict()` constructor:**\n\n   You can also use the `dict()` constructor to create a shallow copy.\n\n   ```python\n   dict1 = {\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2\"}\n   dict2 = dict(dict1)\n   dict2[\"key2\"] = \"WHY?!\"\n   print(dict1)  # Output: {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}\n   print(dict2)  # Output: {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'WHY?!'}\n   ```\n\n3. **Using `copy` module for a deep copy:**\n\n   If your dictionary contains nested dictionaries or other mutable objects, you might need a deep copy. For this, you can use the `copy` module's `deepcopy()` function.\n\n   ```python\n   import copy\n\n   dict1 = {\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": {\"nestedKey\": \"nestedValue\"}}\n   dict2 = copy.deepcopy(dict1)\n   dict2[\"key2\"][\"nestedKey\"] = \"WHY?!\"\n   print(dict1)  # Output: {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': {'nestedKey': 'nestedValue'}}\n   print(dict2)  # Output: {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': {'nestedKey': 'WHY?!'}}\n   ```\n\nChoose the method that best suits your needs based on whether you need a shallow or deep copy."
