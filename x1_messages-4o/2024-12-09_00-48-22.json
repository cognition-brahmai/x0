I want to create a CSV file named Clients100914.csv with headers using the excel dialect. When I execute the SQL command `select *`, it only gives me the table data, but I want the complete table including headers. The table headers should be fetched directly from SQL and not written in Python. I am currently using the following code:\n\n```python\nw = csv.writer(open(Fn,'wb'),dialect='excel')\n#w.writelines(\"header_row\")\n#Fetch into sqld\nw.writerows(sqld)\n```\n\nThis leaves me with the file open and without headers. Additionally, I am unable to figure out how to use the file as a log. How can I modify my code to achieve this?"

        "content": "To achieve your goal of exporting data from a SQLite3 or MySQL database to a CSV file with headers using Python 2.6, you can modify your code to fetch the column names directly from the database cursor. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to do this:\n\n1. **Fetch the column names** from the database cursor.\n2. **Write the column names as headers** to your CSV file.\n3. **Write the data rows** to your CSV file.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can modify your code to include these steps:\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\nimport csv\n\n# Replace 'your_database.db' with your database file name\nconn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')\ncursor = conn.cursor()\n\n# Execute your query\ncursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM clients\")\n\n# Fetch all data\nsqld = cursor.fetchall()\n\n# Get the column names from the cursor description\ncolumn_names = [description[0] for description in cursor.description]\n\n# File name for the CSV\nFn = 'Clients100914.csv'\n\n# Open the file for writing in binary mode (Python 2.6)\nwith open(Fn, 'wb') as csvfile:\n    # Create a CSV writer object\n    w = csv.writer(csvfile, dialect='excel')\n    \n    # Write the headers\n    w.writerow(column_names)\n    \n    # Write the data rows\n    w.writerows(sqld)\n\n# Close the cursor and connection\ncursor.close()\nconn.close()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Fetching Column Names**: The `cursor.description` provides metadata about the columns in the result set, where each entry is a sequence with the column name as the first element.\n  \n- **Writing Headers**: The `writerow()` function is used to write a single row (in this case, the header) to the CSV file.\n\n- **Writing Data Rows**: The `writerows()` function is used to write multiple rows (i.e., the fetched data) to the CSV file.\n\nThis code opens the CSV file in binary mode (`'wb'`) as it is required in Python 2.6 to avoid newline issues on Windows. Make sure to replace `'your_database.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database file.\n\nIf you are using MySQL, you need to adjust the database connection part using a MySQL connector like `MySQLdb` or `pymysql`. The rest of the code remains largely the same."
