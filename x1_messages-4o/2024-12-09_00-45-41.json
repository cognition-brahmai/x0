        "content": "To execute a command line program in a different directory using Python, you can indeed change the working directory temporarily and then run your command. However, using `os.system(command)` alone does not allow you to specify a different directory directly. Instead, you can achieve this by using `os.chdir()` to change the directory before executing the command, or alternatively, you can use the `subprocess` module, which provides more flexibility and control.\n\nHere's how you can do it using `os.system()` with `os.chdir()`:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Save the current directory\noriginal_directory = os.getcwd()\n\ntry:\n    # Change to the desired directory\n    os.chdir('/path/to/target/directory')\n\n    # Execute the command\n    os.system('your_command_here')\nfinally:\n    # Restore the original directory\n    os.chdir(original_directory)\n```\n\nAlternatively, using the `subprocess` module is a more modern and preferred approach, as it allows you to specify the working directory directly:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\n# Execute the command in the specified directory\nsubprocess.run('your_command_here', shell=True, cwd='/path/to/target/directory')\n```\n\nUsing `subprocess.run()` with the `cwd` parameter is generally safer and more flexible than manipulating the current working directory with `os.chdir()`, especially in multi-threaded applications where changing the working directory could cause issues."
