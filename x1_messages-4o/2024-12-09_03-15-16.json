I was able to resolve this by changing the folder name from 'crypto' to 'Crypto'. Now, I am encountering a new error that states `No module named 'winrandom'`. When I try to install it through PIP, I receive an error that says `Cannot export PyInit_winrandom: symbol not defined`. Is there a way to resolve this issue and make it work?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing with `winrandom` is quite common when dealing with `pyCrypto` on Windows. Here are some steps you can take to try and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Compatibility**: First, ensure that all components you're using are compatible with each other. Since you're on Windows 7 x86 with Python 3.4.1, make sure you're using versions of libraries that are compatible with this setup.\n\n2. **Use PyCryptodome Instead**: `pyCrypto` is an outdated library and has not been maintained for a while. It is recommended to use `pyCryptodome` as a drop-in replacement. `pyCryptodome` is actively maintained and can be installed easily with pip. You can install it using the following command:\n   ```bash\n   pip install pycryptodome\n   ```\n\n3. **Modify Imports**: If you switch to `pyCryptodome`, you'll need to adjust your imports in your Python scripts. For example:\n   ```python\n   from Crypto.Cipher import AES\n   ```\n   Ensure you replace any instances of `Crypto` with `Cryptodome` if needed, although `pyCryptodome` aims to be a drop-in replacement.\n\n4. **Reinstall Paramiko**: Sometimes, reinstalling Paramiko after switching to `pyCryptodome` can resolve dependency issues. You can reinstall it using:\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall paramiko\n   pip install paramiko\n   ```\n\n5. **Check for Other Dependencies**: Ensure that all other dependencies required by Paramiko and `pyCryptodome` are installed correctly.\n\n6. **Use Precompiled Binaries**: If you're still facing issues, consider using precompiled binaries for Windows, which are available for many packages. This can help avoid compilation issues on Windows.\n\n7. **Upgrade Python**: If possible, consider upgrading your Python version to a more recent one. Python 3.4.1 is quite old, and upgrading can resolve many compatibility issues.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and get Paramiko working on your system."
