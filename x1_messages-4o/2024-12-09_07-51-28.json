        "content": "When you encounter dates in Excel being read as integers in Python, it's because Excel stores dates as the number of days since a base date, which is typically January 1, 1900. The integer you see is the count of days from this base date.\n\nTo convert these integers back into date format using Python, you can use the `datetime` module. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Example integer from Excel\nexcel_date = 42139\n\n# Define the base date\nbase_date = datetime(1899, 12, 30)  # Excel's base date for Windows systems\n\n# Convert the Excel date integer to a date\nconverted_date = base_date + timedelta(days=excel_date)\n\nprint(converted_date)  # Output will be in datetime format\n```\n\nIf you're working with a `pandas` DataFrame, you can apply this conversion to an entire column using the `apply` method:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {'date_integer': [42139, 42005, 42200]}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Function to convert Excel date to datetime\ndef excel_date_to_datetime(excel_date):\n    base_date = datetime(1899, 12, 30)  # Excel's base date\n    return base_date + timedelta(days=excel_date)\n\n# Apply the conversion to the DataFrame column\ndf['converted_date'] = df['date_integer'].apply(excel_date_to_datetime)\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThis approach should help you convert the integer representation of dates back to a more readable date format in Python."
