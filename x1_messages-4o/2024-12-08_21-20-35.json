The puzzle should involve identifying nocturnal mammals that live in underground burrows in the African savannah. The information should be organized in a nested dictionary format. The outer dictionary should include 'burrow depth', 'burrow width', and 'burrow length' as keys. The inner dictionary should include 'name', 'species', 'diet', 'nocturnal habits', and 'burrow temperature' as keys. The 'name' key should contain the mammal's name, 'species' key should contain the species of the mammal, 'diet' key should contain the type of food the mammal eats, 'nocturnal habits' key should contain information about the mammal's sleep patterns, and 'burrow temperature' key should contain information about the temperature of the burrow. Can you provide at least two examples of such nocturnal mammals in the nested dictionary format? Solve the puzzle by providing the correct mammals with their respective information."
