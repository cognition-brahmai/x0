        "content": "Can you create a custom guitar chord progression generator that creates unique progressions based on user input? The generator should consider the preferred chord type and key, and also incorporate commonly used chord progressions for the selected key to ensure a smooth flow. However, the catch is that the generated progressions should not be predictable and should not follow commonly used patterns in popular music. Can you come up with a puzzle-like algorithm that satisfies these requirements and produces pleasing-sounding progressions? Let's test your creativity and logic skills!"

        "content": "Sure! Creating a unique and unpredictable guitar chord progression generator involves a blend of music theory, creativity, and randomness. Here\u2019s a conceptual algorithm that could achieve this:\n\n### Step 1: Define Inputs\n\n1. **Key**: The user selects a key (e.g., C Major, A Minor).\n2. **Preferred Chord Types**: User inputs preferred chord types (e.g., major, minor, 7th, sus4).\n3. **Progression Length**: Number of chords in the progression.\n\n### Step 2: Establish a Chord Pool\n\n1. **Diatonic Chords**: List all diatonic chords in the selected key.\n   - For C Major: C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim.\n2. **Extended Chords and Variations**: Expand the chord options with variations and extensions.\n   - E.g., Cmaj7, Dm7, Fmaj9, Gsus4.\n\n### Step 3: Incorporate Common Progressions\n\n1. **Common Progressions**: Identify common progressions within the chosen key that serve as a backbone.\n   - E.g., I-IV-V-I, ii-V-I.\n2. **Break the Pattern**: Use these as a base but introduce variations and substitutions.\n\n### Step 4: Randomization with Constraints\n\n1. **Random Selection**: Randomly select chords from the pool while considering user preferences.\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - Ensure smooth voice leading (minimal movement between chords).\n   - Avoid overused intervals (e.g., avoid always going from I to IV directly).\n\n### Step 5: Add Unpredictability\n\n1. **Non-linear Progression**: Occasionally jump to less related chords to add surprise (e.g., tritone substitution, modal interchange).\n2. **Chord Extensions and Alterations**: Randomly add extensions or alterations to chords to create unique sounds.\n   - E.g., turn a G into a G7#11.\n\n### Step 6: Smooth Flow and Resolution\n\n1. **Voice Leading**: Ensure smooth transitions between chords by focusing on common tones.\n2. **Resolution**: Aim for a resolution at the end of the progression to give a sense of completeness.\n\n### Example Algorithm\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef generate_progression(key, chord_types, length):\n    # Define chords in key and variations\n    chords = {\n        'C Major': ['C', 'Dm', 'Em', 'F', 'G', 'Am', 'Bdim'],\n        'A Minor': ['Am', 'Bdim', 'C', 'Dm', 'Em', 'F', 'G'],\n    }\n    \n    # Chord extensions and alterations\n    extensions = ['maj7', 'm7', 'sus4', '7', '9', 'add9', '#11']\n    \n    # Get chords in the selected key\n    selected_chords = chords.get(key, [])\n    \n    progression = []\n    \n    for _ in range(length):\n        chord = random.choice(selected_chords)\n        \n        # Randomly decide to add an extension\n        if random.choice([True, False]):\n            chord += random.choice(extensions)\n        \n        # Ensure preferred chord types are included\n        if any(chord_type in chord for chord_type in chord_types):\n            progression.append(chord)\n        else:\n            progression.append(random.choice(selected_chords))\n    \n    # Ensure the progression is interesting and resolves\n    progression[-1] = selected_chords[0]  # Resolve to tonic\n    \n    return progression\n\n# Example usage\nkey = 'C Major'\nchord_types = ['maj', 'm7']\nlength = 8\nprogression = generate_progression(key, chord_types, length)\nprint(progression)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Chord Pool**: The script creates a pool of diatonic chords and their variations for a given key.\n- **Random Selection and Variation**: Chords are selected randomly, with occasional extensions to maintain unpredictability.\n- **Constraint Check**: Ensures the inclusion of user-preferred chord types and resolves the progression to the tonic for a smooth finish.\n\nThis setup allows for flexibility and creativity while maintaining musical coherence. Adjusting randomness, constraints, and variations can further tailor the output to suit different musical tastes and styles."
