Here is the code I am working with:\n\n```python\nimport concurrent.futures\n\ndef f(x):\n    return f**2\n\nmy_iter = range(1000000)\n\ndef run(f,my_iter):\n    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n        function = list(executor.map(f, my_iter))\n    return results\n\nrun(f, my_iter) # wrap tqdr around this function?\n```\n\nHow can I easily display a status bar using `ThreadPoolExecutor`?"

        "content": "To integrate a progress bar with `tqdm` while using `ThreadPoolExecutor`, you can wrap your iterable with `tqdm` to track its progress. However, due to the nature of multithreading, you need to ensure that `tqdm` updates are synchronized. You can achieve this by using `tqdm`'s `tqdm` class with a manual update method. Here's how you can modify your code to include a status bar:\n\n```python\nimport concurrent.futures\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**2\n\nmy_iter = range(1000000)\n\ndef run(f, my_iter):\n    results = []\n    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n        # Initialize tqdm\n        with tqdm(total=len(my_iter)) as pbar:\n            # Define a wrapper to update the tqdm progress bar\n            def wrapper(x):\n                result = f(x)\n                pbar.update(1)  # Update the progress bar by one step\n                return result\n\n            # Map with the wrapper function\n            results = list(executor.map(wrapper, my_iter))\n    return results\n\nrun(f, my_iter)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Progress Bar Initialization:** We create a `tqdm` progress bar by wrapping it around the length of the iterable (`my_iter`). This sets up the total number of steps in the progress bar.\n\n2. **Wrapper Function:** We define a `wrapper` function that calls the original function `f` and updates the progress bar by one step (`pbar.update(1)`) each time it completes a task.\n\n3. **Mapping:** Instead of mapping directly to `f`, we map the `wrapper` function, which combines the original functionality with progress updates.\n\nThis method ensures that `tqdm` updates correctly while maintaining the concurrent execution of tasks."
