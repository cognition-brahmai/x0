        "content": "I am working on a project that involves a combination of Python code and XML code. I have several classes in my Python code that I wish to rename. However, some of these classes have short names that are reused in other class names, and I do not wish to change these names. For example, I want to rename 'AdminAction' to 'AdminActionPlug' and 'AdminActionLogger' to 'AdminActionLoggerPlug', but using a simple search and replace function would inadvertently change the second class name when changing the first. Does anyone have experience with Python refactoring tools that can handle this task? It would be even better if the tool could also handle changing class names in XML documents."

        "content": "Refactoring code, especially when it involves renaming classes or variables that may overlap with other names, can indeed be tricky. Fortunately, there are several tools and strategies you can use to achieve this while minimizing errors.\n\n### Python Refactoring Tools:\n\n1. **PyCharm**:\n   - PyCharm is an IDE with advanced refactoring capabilities. It can accurately rename classes and methods, understanding the context in which they are used. \n   - Steps:\n     1. Right-click on the class name you want to rename.\n     2. Select `Refactor` -> `Rename`.\n     3. PyCharm will show you all the occurrences of the class name and allow you to selectively rename them.\n\n2. **Rope**:\n   - Rope is a Python refactoring library that can be integrated into editors like VSCode or used standalone.\n   - Rope is command-line based and can be scripted to automate renaming across multiple files.\n\n3. **Jedi**:\n   - Jedi is another library that is great for static analysis and refactoring of Python code.\n   - It can be used programmatically to navigate and refactor code.\n\n### Handling XML:\n\nFor handling XML files, you may need to write a custom script or use a tool that supports XML parsing and manipulation:\n\n1. **XPath and ElementTree**:\n   - Python\u2019s `xml.etree.ElementTree` module, combined with XPath, can be used to locate and rename class names in XML files selectively.\n\n2. **lxml**:\n   - The `lxml` library is more powerful than `ElementTree` and supports complex XML manipulations. You can use it to find and replace specific class names in your XML documents.\n\n3. **Custom Scripts**:\n   - If the XML structure is straightforward, writing a custom Python script using regular expressions and string manipulation might suffice. However, this approach might be less robust.\n\n### Strategy:\n\n1. **Plan and Backup**:\n   - Always create a backup of your codebase before performing large-scale refactoring.\n   - Plan the changes carefully, especially when the class names overlap.\n\n2. **Refactor in Steps**:\n   - Start by refactoring Python code using an IDE or a library like Rope.\n   - Once the Python code is refactored, write a script to handle the XML files.\n\n3. **Testing**:\n   - After refactoring, run all your tests to ensure everything is still working as expected.\n   - Consider adding new tests if needed, especially ones that could catch issues related to the changes.\n\n4. **Manual Review**:\n   - After automated refactoring, manually review the critical parts of your code and XML to ensure everything is correct.\n\nBy using these tools and strategies, you should be able to effectively rename your classes without affecting other parts of your codebase inadvertently."
