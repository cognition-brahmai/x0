        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The `ImportError` you're encountering is likely due to the fact that the `set_random_seed` function is not directly available in the top-level `tensorflow` module. Instead, it is part of the `tensorflow.random` module. To resolve this, you can modify your import statement to properly access the function from the correct module. Here's how you can do it:\n\nReplace:\n```python\nfrom tensorflow import set_random_seed\n```\n\nWith:\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.random import set_seed\n```\n\nThen, you can use `set_seed` function in your code like this:\n\n```python\n# Set the seed for TensorFlow's random number generator\nset_seed(42)\n```\n\nUsing `set_seed` helps ensure reproducibility by setting the random seed for TensorFlow's operations. This change should fix the `ImportError` you are encountering.\n\nAdditionally, make sure you have the correct version of TensorFlow installed, as the APIs can vary between different versions. If you're using TensorFlow 2.x, the above solution should work. If you're using an older version, consider upgrading to a more recent version of TensorFlow. You can upgrade TensorFlow using:\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade tensorflow\n```\n\nOnce you've updated your TensorFlow installation and adjusted the import statement, the error should be resolved."
