Here's a simple C code snippet to determine if a given number is even or odd:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int number;\n    \n    // Ask the user to enter a number\n    printf(\"Enter an integer: \");\n    scanf(\"%d\", &number);\n    \n    // Determine if the number is even or odd\n    if (number % 2 == 0) {\n        printf(\"%d is even.\\n\", number);\n    } else {\n        printf(\"%d is odd.\\n\", number);\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis program prompts the user to enter an integer, then it checks if the number is divisible by 2 using the modulus operator `%`. If the remainder is 0, the number is even; otherwise, it's odd."
