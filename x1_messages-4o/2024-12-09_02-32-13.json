My file structure is as follows:\n\n```\n/app\n    - app_runner.py\n    /services\n        - app.py \n    /templates\n        - mainpage.html\n    /styles\n        - mainpage.css\n```\n\nIn my mainpage.html, I have linked the stylesheet like this:\n\n```\n<html>\n    <head>\n        <link rel= \"stylesheet\" type= \"text/css\" href= \"../styles/mainpage.css\">\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <!-- content --> \n```\n\nI'm rendering the template in my Python code as follows:\n\n```\nreturn render_template(\"mainpage.html\", variables..)\n```\n\nI know this much is working because I'm still able to render the template. However, when I tried to move my styling code from a \"style\" block within the html's \"head\" tag to an external file, all the styling disappeared, leaving a bare HTML page. Is there a problem with my file structure or the way I'm linking the stylesheet?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is likely related to how Flask handles static files. By default, Flask expects static files like stylesheets, JavaScript files, and images to be located in a folder named `static`. You should modify your file structure and update your HTML to properly reference the stylesheet.\n\nHere's how you can fix it:\n\n1. Change your file structure to include a `static` directory:\n\n```\n/app\n    - app_runner.py\n    /services\n        - app.py \n    /templates\n        - mainpage.html\n    /static\n        /styles\n            - mainpage.css\n```\n\n2. Update your `mainpage.html` to use Flask's `url_for` function to correctly link the stylesheet:\n\n```html\n<html>\n    <head>\n        <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='styles/mainpage.css') }}\">\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <!-- content --> \n```\n\nIn this setup, Flask will serve files from the `static` directory, and `url_for('static', filename='styles/mainpage.css')` will generate the correct URL to access your stylesheet.\n\n3. Ensure your Flask app is serving static files correctly. Flask does this by default, so you shouldn't need to change any configurations unless you've altered the default behavior.\n\nBy following these steps, your external stylesheet should be linked correctly, and your styles should be applied to the HTML template."
