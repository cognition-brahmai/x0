        "content": "To skip the first line or row (which is typically a header) while looping through a CSV file in Python, you can use the `csv` module, which is part of Python's standard library. There are a few ways to achieve this. Here are some common methods:\n\n### Method 1: Using `csv.reader`\nYou can use the `csv.reader` object and simply skip the first row by using `next()` to advance the iterator.\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\nwith open('yourfile.csv', mode='r', newline='') as file:\n    csv_reader = csv.reader(file)\n    next(csv_reader)  # Skip the header row\n    for row in csv_reader:\n        print(row)  # Process each row\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using `csv.DictReader`\nIf you prefer working with dictionaries, `csv.DictReader` automatically uses the first row as the header to create dictionary keys. You can still skip the header by using `next()`.\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\nwith open('yourfile.csv', mode='r', newline='') as file:\n    csv_reader = csv.DictReader(file)\n    next(csv_reader)  # Skip the header row\n    for row in csv_reader:\n        print(row)  # Process each row as a dictionary\n```\n\n### Method 3: Manually skipping the first line\nIf you want to handle it manually without using CSV-specific functions, you can read the file line by line and skip the first one.\n\n```python\nwith open('yourfile.csv', mode='r', newline='') as file:\n    next(file)  # Skip the header line\n    for line in file:\n        print(line.strip().split(','))  # Process each line\n```\n\nChoose the method that best fits your needs based on whether you prefer working with lists or dictionaries."
