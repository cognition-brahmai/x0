Is there a more concise way to achieve this without passing the list in the parameters? Here is the code I have tried so far:\n\n```python\nt = (1,2,3)\nt2 = (4,5)\n\nl.addAll(t)\nl.addAll(t2)\nprint l # [1,2,3,4,5]\n\ndef t_add(t,stuff):\n    for x in t:\n        stuff.append(x)\n```"

        "content": "To achieve this task in a more concise manner without passing the list in the parameters, you can use the `extend()` method of lists in Python, which appends elements from an iterable to the end of the list. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nt = (1, 2, 3)\nt2 = (4, 5)\n\nl = []  # Initialize an empty list\n\nl.extend(t)   # Add all elements from tuple t\nl.extend(t2)  # Add all elements from tuple t2\n\nprint(l)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can also use list unpacking with the `*` operator to achieve the same result in a more concise way:\n\n```python\nt = (1, 2, 3)\nt2 = (4, 5)\n\nl = [*t, *t2]  # Unpack elements from both tuples into the list\n\nprint(l)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\nBoth approaches achieve the same result and are more concise than manually iterating through each tuple and appending the elements to the list."
