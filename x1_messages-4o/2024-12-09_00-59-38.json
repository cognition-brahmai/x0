    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to a missing migration dependency in your Django project. Specifically, the migration `testBolt.0001_initial` is trying to reference a migration `0004_auto_20150221_2011` from the `delivery_boy` app that doesn't exist. Here are steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify Migration Files**:\n   - Check the `migrations` folder of the `delivery_boy` app to ensure that the migration file `0004_auto_20150221_2011.py` actually exists. If it doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing this error.\n\n2. **Check for Missing Migrations**:\n   - If the migration file is missing, you should verify if it was accidentally deleted or moved. If you have version control (like Git), check the history to see if it was removed recently.\n\n3. **Re-create the Missing Migration**:\n   - If the migration file is missing, you might need to recreate it. You can try running `python manage.py makemigrations delivery_boy` to re-generate any missing migrations.\n\n4. **Update Dependencies**:\n   - If the migration was intentionally removed and should no longer be a dependency, you need to update the migration file `testBolt.0001_initial.py` to remove the dependency on the missing migration. Open the migration file and look for the `dependencies` list. Remove or update the tuple `(u'delivery_boy', u'0004_auto_20150221_2011')`.\n\n5. **Fake Migrations (if necessary)**:\n   - If you know that the state of the database is correct and you just want to bypass this error, you can use `python manage.py migrate --fake` to fake the migrations. Be cautious with this, as it can lead to inconsistencies if not handled properly.\n\n6. **Reset Migrations**:\n   - As a last resort, if your project allows it, you can reset the migrations for the affected apps. This involves:\n     - Deleting all migration files in the `migrations` folders of the affected apps (except for `__init__.py`).\n     - Running `python manage.py makemigrations` to create initial migrations again.\n     - Running `python manage.py migrate`.\n\n7. **Check for Circular Dependencies**:\n   - Ensure there are no circular dependencies between your migrations that could be causing the issue.\n\nAfter following these steps, try running `python manage.py migrate` again to see if the issue is resolved. Always ensure you have backups and version control in place before making significant changes to your migrations."
