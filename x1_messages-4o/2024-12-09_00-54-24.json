        "content": "In Python 3.2, `assertDictContainsSubset` has indeed been deprecated. To check if one dictionary (`dic2`) is a subset of another dictionary (`dic`), you can iterate over the key-value pairs of `dic2` and check if each pair exists in `dic`. Here's an efficient way using `unittest` assertions:\n\n```python\ndef assertDictContainsSubset(subset, dictionary):\n    for key, value in subset.items():\n        if key not in dictionary or dictionary[key] != value:\n            raise AssertionError(f\"Dictionary does not contain the subset: {key}: {value}\")\n\n# Example usage:\ndic = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\ndic2 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n\nassertDictContainsSubset(dic2, dic)  # No AssertionError means test passed\n```\n\nThis function iterates through each key-value pair in `dic2` (the subset) and checks if the key exists in `dic` and if the corresponding value matches. If any key-value pair does not match, an `AssertionError` is raised, indicating that `dic` does not contain `dic2` as a subset."
