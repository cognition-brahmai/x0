However, I am having trouble implementing the recursion needed for the algorithm to handle multiple numbers. Could someone help explain how to do this? Here is the code I've written so far:\n\n```python\ndef GCD(numbers):\n\n    if numbers[-1] == 0:\n        return numbers[0]\n\n    # i'm stuck here, this is wrong\n    for i in range(len(numbers)-1):\n        print GCD([numbers[i+1], numbers[i] % numbers[i+1]])\n\nprint GCD(30, 40, 36)\n```\n\nI've also tried to modify the function as follows, but it's still not working:\n\n```python\ndef GCD(numbers):\n\n    if numbers[-1] == 0:\n        return numbers[0]\n\n    gcd = 0\n\n    for i in range(len(numbers)):\n        gcd = GCD([numbers[i+1], numbers[i] % numbers[i+1]])\n        gcdtemp = GCD([gcd, numbers[i+2]])\n        gcd = gcdtemp\n\n    return gcd\n```"

        "content": "To calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of multiple numbers using the Euclidean algorithm, you can start by defining a helper function that calculates the GCD of two numbers. Then, use this helper function recursively to find the GCD of larger lists.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to implementing this in Python:\n\n1. Define a helper function, `gcd_pair`, that calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n2. Use the helper function in a main function, `GCD`, that applies this logic iteratively or recursively over the list of numbers.\n\nHere's the corrected implementation:\n\n```python\ndef gcd_pair(a, b):\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\ndef GCD(numbers):\n    # Start with the first number\n    current_gcd = numbers[0]\n    # Iterate over the rest of the numbers\n    for num in numbers[1:]:\n        current_gcd = gcd_pair(current_gcd, num)\n    return current_gcd\n\n# Call the GCD function with a list of numbers\nprint(GCD([30, 40, 36]))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`gcd_pair(a, b)`**: This function calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. It repeatedly replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with `a % b` until `b` becomes zero. When `b` is zero, `a` is the GCD.\n  \n- **`GCD(numbers)`**: Start with the first number as the initial GCD. Then, for each subsequent number in the list, update the current GCD using the `gcd_pair` function.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles any number of integers by iteratively applying the Euclidean algorithm."
