I have been using this link in all my templates: `<link type=\"text/css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/stylesheets/style.css\"/>`. But it seems like I'm missing something. Is there anything special that I have to do with Flask to make the CSS work? Do I have to include any special Python code to correctly apply CSS in Flask?"

        "content": "In Flask, serving static files like CSS requires a specific folder structure and some configuration. It sounds like you might be missing a step in setting up your static files. Here's a checklist to help you ensure that your CSS is being served correctly:\n\n1. **Folder Structure**: Make sure your CSS file is in the correct directory. By default, Flask looks for static files in a folder named `static`. Your project structure should look something like this:\n\n   ```\n   your_project/\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 app.py\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 templates/\n   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 your_template.html\n   \u2514\u2500\u2500 static/\n       \u2514\u2500\u2500 stylesheets/\n           \u2514\u2500\u2500 style.css\n   ```\n\n2. **Linking to Static Files**: In your HTML templates, use Flask's `url_for` function to link to static files. This ensures that the correct URL is generated for the static files:\n\n   ```html\n   <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='stylesheets/style.css') }}\">\n   ```\n\n3. **Running the Flask Server**: Make sure you are running the Flask development server. Static files are served automatically in development mode. Use the following command to run your app:\n\n   ```bash\n   flask run\n   ```\n\n4. **Check Console for Errors**: Open the browser's developer console and check for any errors related to loading the CSS file. This can often provide clues if the file path is incorrect or if there are permission issues.\n\n5. **Clear Cache**: Sometimes, browsers cache static files. Clear your browser cache or do a hard refresh (Ctrl + F5 on Windows/Linux or Cmd + Shift + R on macOS) to ensure you're loading the latest version of your CSS.\n\n6. **Production Considerations**: If you're deploying your app to a production environment, you might need a different setup for serving static files, such as configuring your web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache) to serve static content.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to get your CSS working with your Flask web app. If the problem persists, double-check the file paths and ensure that your Flask app is running without errors."
