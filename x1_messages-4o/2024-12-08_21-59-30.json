Here's a challenge for you: given the data in columns A, B, and C, with headers \"Item\", \"Quantity\", and \"Unit Price\" respectively, create a formula in column D to calculate the total cost for each item. But wait, there's a twist! The formula cannot use multiplication or the \"*\" symbol. Once you have solved this, copy the formula down to the rest of the cells in column D and add a total row at the bottom of the table to sum up the total cost of the purchase order. Can you figure out the formula for the total row without using the \"SUM\" function or the \"+\" symbol? Good luck!"

        "content": "Certainly! This is an interesting challenge. Let's tackle it step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Calculating Total Cost for Each Item Without Multiplication\n\nTo calculate the total cost for each item without using multiplication or the \"*\" symbol, you can use the `SUMPRODUCT` function, which is typically used to multiply corresponding components in arrays and then sum those products. However, since we're applying it on a row basis, it effectively acts as a multiplication for the two values.\n\nAssuming the first data row is in row 2, the formula in column D would be:\n\n```excel\n=SUMPRODUCT(B2, C2)\n```\n\nCopy this formula down the column to apply it to all items.\n\n### Step 2: Calculating Total Cost of the Purchase Order Without \"SUM\" or \"+\"\n\nTo find the total cost without using \"SUM\" or \"+\", we can creatively use the `SUBTOTAL` function, which can perform a variety of aggregations. Here's how you can apply it for a total sum:\n\n1. Place the following formula in the cell at the bottom of column D where you want the total cost to appear:\n\n```excel\n=SUBTOTAL(9, D2:D1000)\n```\n\nThis assumes your data extends to row 1000. Adjust the range as necessary. The number `9` indicates the sum operation within the `SUBTOTAL` function.\n\nAnd there you go! You've calculated the total cost for each item and the total purchase order without using the prohibited operations."
