How can I define a forward function that can process these 2 inputs separately and then combine them in the middle layer?"

        "content": "To construct a neural network in PyTorch with two different types of inputs\u2014image data and non-image data\u2014you can define a custom neural network class that processes each input separately before combining them in a fully connected layer. Below is an example implementation of how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\nclass DualInputNN(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, num_image_features, num_non_image_features, num_classes):\n        super(DualInputNN, self).__init__()\n        \n        # Define CNN layers for image data\n        self.cnn_layers = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=16, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1),\n            nn.ReLU(),\n            nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2),\n            nn.Conv2d(in_channels=16, out_channels=32, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1),\n            nn.ReLU(),\n            nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)\n        )\n        \n        # Calculate the flattened size of CNN output\n        # This needs to match the input size to the first fully connected layer\n        self.flattened_size = 32 * (num_image_features // 4) * (num_image_features // 4)\n\n        # Define fully connected layer for non-image data\n        self.fc_non_image = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Linear(num_non_image_features, 64),\n            nn.ReLU(),\n            nn.Linear(64, 32),\n            nn.ReLU()\n        )\n        \n        # Define fully connected layers for combined data\n        self.fc_combined = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Linear(self.flattened_size + 32, 128),\n            nn.ReLU(),\n            nn.Linear(128, num_classes)\n        )\n\n    def forward(self, image_input, non_image_input):\n        # Process image data through CNN layers\n        x1 = self.cnn_layers(image_input)\n        x1 = x1.view(x1.size(0), -1)  # Flatten the output\n        \n        # Process non-image data through fully connected layers\n        x2 = self.fc_non_image(non_image_input)\n        \n        # Concatenate both processed inputs\n        x = torch.cat((x1, x2), dim=1)\n        \n        # Pass the concatenated output through combined fully connected layers\n        x = self.fc_combined(x)\n        \n        return x\n\n# Example usage:\n# num_image_features is the size of the input image (assuming square images)\n# num_non_image_features is the size of the non-image data input\n# num_classes is the number of output classes\nmodel = DualInputNN(num_image_features=64, num_non_image_features=10, num_classes=5)\n\n# Example inputs\nimage_input = torch.randn(8, 3, 64, 64)  # Batch of 8 images\nnon_image_input = torch.randn(8, 10)  # Batch of 8 sets of non-image features\n\n# Forward pass\noutput = model(image_input, non_image_input)\nprint(output.shape)  # Should be [8, num_classes]\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **CNN Layers:** We define a series of convolutional and pooling layers to process image data. Ensure that the output of these layers is flattened appropriately to be used in the fully connected layers.\n\n2. **Fully Connected Layers for Non-Image Data:** These layers process non-image data inputs separately before combining with the CNN output.\n\n3. **Concatenation:** The image and non-image data outputs are concatenated along the feature dimension (dim=1).\n\n4. **Combined Fully Connected Layers:** These layers take the combined data and output the final prediction.\n\nThis architecture allows you to handle two different types of inputs simultaneously and can be extended or modified based on your specific requirements."
