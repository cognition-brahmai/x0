The code worked perfectly in Python 2 and also when I tested it separately in a different file, but it's throwing a `TypeError` when put in another file. The error says \"translate() takes exactly one argument (2 given)\". Why is this happening and how do I make it work? Here's the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nimport nltk, os, json, csv, string, cPickle\nfrom scipy.stats import scoreatpercentile\n\nlmtzr = nltk.stem.wordnet.WordNetLemmatizer()\n\ndef sanitize(wordList): \n    answer = [word.translate(None, string.punctuation) for word in wordList] \n    answer = [lmtzr.lemmatize(word.lower()) for word in answer]\n    return answer\n\nwords = []\nfor filename in json_list:\n    words.extend([sanitize(nltk.word_tokenize(' '.join([tweet['text'] \n               for tweet in json.load(open(filename,READ))])))])\n```\n\nAnd here is the error I'm getting:\n\n```python\nFile \"foo.py\", line 8, in <module>\n  for tweet in json.load(open(filename, READ))])))])\nFile \"foo.py\", line 2, in sanitize\n  answer = [word.translate(None, string.punctuation) for word in wordList]\nTypeError: translate() takes exactly one argument (2 given)\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is a result of the differences between Python 2 and Python 3. In Python 2, the `str.translate` method could take two arguments: a translation table and a string of characters to delete. However, in Python 3, the `str.translate` method has been changed to only take one argument, which is a translation table created by `str.maketrans`.\n\nTo remove punctuation in Python 3, you need to use `str.maketrans` to create a translation table and then pass it to `str.translate`. Here's how you can modify your `sanitize` function to work in Python 3:\n\n```python\nimport nltk, os, json, csv, string\n\nlmtzr = nltk.stem.wordnet.WordNetLemmatizer()\n\ndef sanitize(wordList): \n    # Create a translation table that maps each punctuation character to None\n    translator = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)\n    # Apply the translation table to each word\n    answer = [word.translate(translator) for word in wordList]\n    # Lemmatize and convert to lowercase\n    answer = [lmtzr.lemmatize(word.lower()) for word in answer]\n    return answer\n\nwords = []\nfor filename in json_list:\n    with open(filename, 'r') as file:\n        tweets = json.load(file)\n        for tweet in tweets:\n            words.extend(sanitize(nltk.word_tokenize(tweet['text'])))\n```\n\nKey changes:\n\n1. Used `str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)` to create a translation table that maps each punctuation character to `None`.\n2. Applied this translation table to `word.translate()`.\n\nThis should resolve the `TypeError` and allow your code to work correctly in Python 3. Additionally, make sure to handle file operations properly by using a context manager (`with open(...) as file:`) to ensure files are closed after use."
