        "content": "The potential bug in the Swift code arises when the `scores` array is empty. If `scores.count` is zero, the expression `sum / scores.count` will attempt to divide by zero, which will result in a runtime error.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can add a check to handle the case when the `scores` array is empty. Here is a modified version of the function:\n\n```swift\nfunc calculateAverage(scores: [Double]) -> Double {\n    guard !scores.isEmpty else {\n        return 0.0 // or any other default value you prefer\n    }\n    \n    var sum = 0.0\n    for score in scores {\n        sum += score\n    }\n    let average = sum / Double(scores.count)\n    return average\n}\n```\n\nWith this modification, the function now checks if the `scores` array is empty before attempting to calculate the average, thus preventing the division by zero error."
