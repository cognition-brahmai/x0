        "content": "I am writing a wrapper for a command line tool in Python. The tool is usually used in this manner: `$ path_to_tool -option1 -option2 > file_out` and the user gets the output written to file_out, while also being able to see various status messages of the tool as it is running. I am trying to replicate this behavior by also logging stderr (the status messages) to a file. I am using the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom subprocess import call\ncall(['path_to_tool','-option1','option2'], stdout = file_out, stderr = log_file)\n```\n\nThis works fine except that stderr is not written to the screen. If I add code to print the contents of the log_file to the screen then the user will see it after everything is done rather than while it is happening. I need to use call(), or subprocess(), direct stdout to a file and direct stderr to a file, while also writing stderr to the screen in real time as if the tool had been called directly from the command line. This only needs to work on Linux. How can I accomplish this?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired behavior of displaying the `stderr` output in real-time while also logging it to a file, you can use the `subprocess.Popen` method. This method allows you to interact with the subprocess\u2019 input/output streams, making it possible to write to a file and simultaneously display the output to the screen. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\ndef run_tool_with_logging():\n    # Open the output files\n    with open('file_out', 'w') as file_out, open('log_file', 'w') as log_file:\n        # Start the subprocess\n        process = subprocess.Popen(\n            ['path_to_tool', '-option1', '-option2'],\n            stdout=file_out,\n            stderr=subprocess.PIPE,  # Capture stderr\n            text=True  # Ensure the output is in string format\n        )\n\n        # Read and process the stderr output in real time\n        for line in process.stderr:\n            # Write stderr to both log_file and the screen\n            log_file.write(line)\n            print(line, end='')\n\n        # Wait for the subprocess to finish\n        process.wait()\n\n# Run the function\nrun_tool_with_logging()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`subprocess.Popen`**: This is used to spawn the process and allows interaction with its `stdout` and `stderr` streams.\n- **`stdout=file_out`**: Redirects standard output to `file_out`.\n- **`stderr=subprocess.PIPE`**: Captures the standard error and allows you to read it line by line.\n- **`text=True`**: Ensures the output is treated as text (string), making it easier to process line by line.\n- **Loop through `process.stderr`**: This reads the `stderr` output in real-time.\n- **Write to `log_file` and `print` to screen**: Each line of `stderr` is written to `log_file` and also printed to the screen, achieving real-time display and logging.\n\nThis approach ensures that the user sees the status messages as they would if the tool were run directly, while also maintaining a log file of those messages."
