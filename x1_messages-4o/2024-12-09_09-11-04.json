        "content": "Creating a program to extract every word from a given string and return them as a list can be done easily in Python. Here's a simple example of how you could achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef extract_words(input_string):\n    # Split the string into words based on whitespace\n    words = input_string.split()\n    return words\n\n# Example usage\ninput_string = \"Hello, this is a sample string!\"\nwords_list = extract_words(input_string)\nprint(words_list)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`split()` Method**: \n   - The `split()` method is used to divide the string into a list where each word is a list item. By default, it splits by any whitespace (spaces, tabs, or newlines).\n\n2. **Handling Punctuation**: \n   - If you want to remove punctuation and only extract words, you can use the `re` module to use regular expressions.\n\nHere's an enhanced version that removes punctuation:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_words(input_string):\n    # Use regular expression to find words\n    words = re.findall(r'\\b\\w+\\b', input_string)\n    return words\n\n# Example usage\ninput_string = \"Hello, this is a sample string!\"\nwords_list = extract_words(input_string)\nprint(words_list)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`re.findall()`**: \n  - This function returns a list of all occurrences that match the regular expression pattern.\n  - The pattern `\\b\\w+\\b` matches sequences of word characters (alphanumeric and underscore) that are surrounded by word boundaries, effectively extracting words without punctuation.\n\nThis program will give you a list of words extracted from the input string, with punctuation removed."
