        "content": "I'm trying to use Python parameter annotations in my code. However, I'm encountering an \"unresolved reference\" error when I try to use my `WeekDay` class as a type in the function signature of `get_week_days()`. Why is it saying that it can't find my `WeekDay` class? Why would I need to create another class with the same name to stop this error?\n\nHere's the code I'm working with:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Dict\n\nclass WeekDay:\n    def __init__(self, day_number, day_name):\n        self.day_name = day_name\n        self.day_number = day_number\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def get_week_days() -> Dict[str, WeekDay]:  # WeekDay unresolved reference error\n        weekdays = {\n            \"monday\": WeekDay(1, \"Monday\"),\n            \"tuesday\": WeekDay(2, \"Tuesday\"),\n            \"wednesday\": WeekDay(3, \"Wednesday\"),\n            \"thursday\": WeekDay(4, \"Thursday\"),\n            \"friday\": WeekDay(5, \"Friday\"),\n            \"saturday\": WeekDay(6, \"Saturday\"),\n            \"sunday\": WeekDay(7, \"Sunday\")\n        }\n        return weekdays\n```"
    },

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to the fact that the `WeekDay` class is being used in its own method's return type annotation before Python has fully defined the class. This can lead to an \"unresolved reference\" error because, at the time of the annotation, the `WeekDay` class isn't considered fully defined yet.\n\nOne common solution to this problem is to use a forward reference in the type annotation. In Python, you can achieve this by using a string to represent the class name in the type hint. This way, the Python interpreter understands that you're referring to the class by name, even though it hasn't been fully defined at the point of the annotation.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to resolve the error:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Dict\n\nclass WeekDay:\n    def __init__(self, day_number, day_name):\n        self.day_name = day_name\n        self.day_number = day_number\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def get_week_days() -> Dict[str, 'WeekDay']:  # Use a forward reference with 'WeekDay'\n        weekdays = {\n            \"monday\": WeekDay(1, \"Monday\"),\n            \"tuesday\": WeekDay(2, \"Tuesday\"),\n            \"wednesday\": WeekDay(3, \"Wednesday\"),\n            \"thursday\": WeekDay(4, \"Thursday\"),\n            \"friday\": WeekDay(5, \"Friday\"),\n            \"saturday\": WeekDay(6, \"Saturday\"),\n            \"sunday\": WeekDay(7, \"Sunday\")\n        }\n        return weekdays\n```\n\nBy enclosing `WeekDay` in quotes in the type annotation, you effectively defer the resolution of the type, allowing the class to be fully defined by the time it\u2019s actually needed. This should resolve the \"unresolved reference\" error you're encountering."
