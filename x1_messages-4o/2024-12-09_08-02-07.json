For security reasons, I don't want to store the password in the notebook or in a separate file. Currently, I am using `input` to read the password from a user prompt, however, this makes the password visible on the screen. Is there a secure way to obtain the password without it being displayed?"

        "content": "Yes, you can securely obtain the password in an IPython notebook without displaying it on the screen by using the `getpass` module from the Python standard library. The `getpass` module provides a way to prompt the user for a password without echoing what they type, which is useful for sensitive input like passwords.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use `getpass.getpass()` in your IPython notebook:\n\n```python\nimport getpass\n\n# Prompt the user for a password without displaying it\npassword = getpass.getpass(\"Enter your SSH key password: \")\n\n# Use the password for your SSH connection logic here\n```\n\nThis will prompt the user to enter their password, and it will not be displayed on the screen, ensuring that the password remains secure during input."
