        "content": "Welcome to the Web Scraping Puzzle Challenge! Here's a scenario for you: \nYou are a detective and you need to extract important clues from multiple crime scenes on different web pages. The clues are hidden in HTML code and you need to use your puzzle-solving skills to extract them. You have decided to use MATLAB to implement your web scraper in the [MATLAB code] data format. However, to make it more challenging, you need to solve the following puzzles to successfully extract the clues:\n1) HTTP Requests: To access the crime scenes, you need to first send HTTP requests to the web pages using MATLAB. You can only access the crime scenes if you correctly answer the following puzzle: \"What is the missing number in this sequence: 1, 3, 5, _, 9, 11?\" \n2) HTML Parser: The clues are hidden in the HTML content of the crime scenes. To extract them, you need to use the HTML Parser toolbox. But to gain access to the toolbox, you need to answer this puzzle: \"What has a head, a tail, is brown, and has no legs?\" \n3) Regular Expressions: The clues are mixed with irrelevant data in the HTML code. To filter and extract only the relevant data, you need to use regular expressions in MATLAB. But to use regular expressions, you need to solve this puzzle: \"What starts with an E, ends with an E, but only contains one letter?\" \n4) Anti-Scraping Mechanisms: The crime scenes are protected by anti-scraping mechanisms to prevent bots from accessing them. To avoid detection and access the crime scenes, you need to answer this puzzle: \"What is the odd one out: Apple, Banana, Grape, Cherry?\" \nIf you successfully solve all the puzzles, you can implement a MATLAB script to scrape multiple crime scenes and extract the relevant clues. Can you solve the puzzles and catch the culprit?"

        "content": "Let's tackle these puzzles one by one so you can proceed with your MATLAB web scraping mission:\n\n1) **HTTP Requests Puzzle**: \"What is the missing number in this sequence: 1, 3, 5, _, 9, 11?\" \n   - The sequence is an arithmetic sequence where each number increases by 2. Therefore, the missing number is 7.\n\n2) **HTML Parser Puzzle**: \"What has a head, a tail, is brown, and has no legs?\" \n   - The answer to this riddle is a \"penny\" (or a coin in general).\n\n3) **Regular Expressions Puzzle**: \"What starts with an E, ends with an E, but only contains one letter?\" \n   - The answer is \"envelope.\" It starts and ends with 'E' and contains one letter inside.\n\n4) **Anti-Scraping Mechanisms Puzzle**: \"What is the odd one out: Apple, Banana, Grape, Cherry?\" \n   - The odd one out is \"Banana.\" Unlike the others, bananas do not grow on trees\u2014technically, they grow on large herbaceous plants.\n\nWith these puzzles solved, you can now proceed to implement your MATLAB script to scrape the web pages:\n\n```matlab\n% Initialize HTTP request\nurl = 'http://example.com'; % Replace with the actual URL of the crime scene\noptions = weboptions('Timeout', 15);\nhtml_content = webread(url, options);\n\n% Parse HTML content\nhtmlTree = htmlTree(html_content);\n\n% Define regular expression to extract relevant clues\npattern = 'your-regex-pattern'; % Replace with the appropriate regular expression\n\n% Extract clues using regular expressions\nclues = regexp(html_content, pattern, 'match');\n\n% Display extracted clues\ndisp('Extracted Clues:');\ndisp(clues);\n```\n\nMake sure to replace the placeholders with the actual URL and regular expression pattern specific to the clues you are looking for. Good luck with your investigation!"
