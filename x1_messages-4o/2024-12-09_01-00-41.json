However, I've noticed that there's no `reload()` equivalent in Python3. The only option I've found is:\n\n```python\nimport parse\nparse.reload() #works\n```\n\nBut I really need this to work:\n\n```python\nparse = __import__('parse')\nparse.reload()\n```\n\nor\n\n```python\nreload(parse)\n```\n\nIs there a way to make this work in Python3?"

        "content": "In Python 3, the `reload()` function is no longer a built-in function as it was in Python 2. Instead, it has been moved to the `importlib` module. To achieve the equivalent of `reload()` in Python 3, you can use the `importlib.reload()` function. Here's how you can modify your code to work in Python 3:\n\n```python\nimport importlib\n\n# Import the module\nparse = __import__('parse')\n\n# Reload the module\nimportlib.reload(parse)\n```\n\nThis should give you the equivalent functionality of reloading a module in Python 3. Remember that reloading a module is generally not recommended unless you have a specific reason for doing so, as it can lead to unexpected behavior especially if there are references to objects from the module elsewhere in your code."
