        "content": "When you use the assignment operator (`new_list = my_list`), you are not actually creating a new list. Instead, you are creating a reference to the original list. This means that both `new_list` and `my_list` point to the same list object in memory. Therefore, any modifications to `new_list` will also affect `my_list`, and vice versa.\n\nTo properly clone or copy the list so that changes to one list do not affect the other, you can use one of the following methods:\n\n1. **Using the `list()` constructor:**\n   ```python\n   new_list = list(my_list)\n   ```\n   This creates a new list object with the same elements as `my_list`.\n\n2. **Using slicing:**\n   ```python\n   new_list = my_list[:]\n   ```\n   This creates a shallow copy of the list by taking a slice of the entire list.\n\n3. **Using the `copy()` method:**\n   ```python\n   new_list = my_list.copy()\n   ```\n   This is a built-in method in Python that creates a shallow copy of the list.\n\n4. **Using the `copy` module for a deep copy:**\n   If your list contains nested lists and you want to copy those as well, you need to perform a deep copy:\n   ```python\n   import copy\n   new_list = copy.deepcopy(my_list)\n   ```\n   This will recursively copy all nested objects, ensuring that changes to nested elements in `new_list` do not affect those in `my_list`.\n\nChoose the method that best suits your needs. For a simple list without nested structures, any of the first three methods will work fine. For lists with nested structures, use the `deepcopy` method."
