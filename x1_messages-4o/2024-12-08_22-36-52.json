From 2 to 5, the difference is 3 (which is the first prime number after 2).\n2. From 5 to 10, the difference is 5 (which is the next prime number).\n3. From 10 to 17, the difference is 7 (which is the next prime number after 5).\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next difference should be the next prime number after 7, which is 11.\n\nTherefore, the next term should be:\n17 + 11 = 28\n\nSo, the complete sequence is: 2, 5, 10, 17, 28, 37."
