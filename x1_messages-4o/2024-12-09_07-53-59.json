        "content": "How can I make `json.dumps` in Python ignore a non-serializable field? I am trying to serialize the output of parsing some binary data with the Construct2.9 library. I want to serialize the result to JSON. The object `packet` is an instance of a Construct class `Container`. It seems to contain a hidden `_io` of type `BytesIO` which is causing a `TypeError` when I try to use `json.dumps(packet)`. I tried using `json.dumps(packet, skipkeys=True)` expecting it to skip the `_io` field, but it still results in the same error. How do I resolve this? I managed to get the code to work by overriding `JSONEncoder` and returning `None` for fields of `BytesIO` type, but that means my serialized string contains lots of `\"_io\": null` elements, which I would prefer not to have at all."

        "content": "To serialize your `packet` object while ignoring non-serializable fields like `_io`, you'll need to create a custom JSON encoder. The goal is to exclude specific fields rather than including them with a `null` value. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. Override the `default` method in a custom `JSONEncoder` to handle non-serializable fields.\n2. Use a function to filter out unwanted fields before serialization.\n\nHere's a step-by-step solution:\n\n```python\nimport json\nfrom io import BytesIO\nfrom construct import Container\n\nclass CustomEncoder(json.JSONEncoder):\n    def default(self, obj):\n        # If the object is of a type that JSON can't serialize, return None\n        if isinstance(obj, BytesIO):\n            return None\n        # Let the base class default method raise the TypeError\n        return super().default(obj)\n\ndef serialize_container(container):\n    def remove_non_serializable(obj):\n        if isinstance(obj, dict):\n            return {k: remove_non_serializable(v) for k, v in obj.items() if not k.startswith('_') and not isinstance(v, BytesIO)}\n        elif isinstance(obj, list):\n            return [remove_non_serializable(v) for v in obj]\n        else:\n            return obj\n\n    # Remove non-serializable fields\n    clean_container = remove_non_serializable(container)\n    return json.dumps(clean_container, cls=CustomEncoder)\n\n# Assuming `packet` is your Construct Container\npacket = Container(_io=BytesIO(), field1=\"value1\", field2=\"value2\")\n\n# Serialize with the custom function\njson_output = serialize_container(packet)\nprint(json_output)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **CustomEncoder:** This class extends `json.JSONEncoder` and overrides the `default` method. It specifically handles `BytesIO` objects by returning `None`. However, since we're filtering them out, this part is more of a safety measure.\n\n2. **remove_non_serializable function:** This recursive function traverses the structure of your `Container` object, removing entries that start with an underscore (`_`) or are of type `BytesIO`.\n\n3. **serialize_container function:** It applies the `remove_non_serializable` function to clean up the `Container` object before passing it to `json.dumps`.\n\nThis approach will ensure that your JSON output doesn't contain the unwanted `_io` fields, providing you with a cleaner serialization of your `packet` object."
