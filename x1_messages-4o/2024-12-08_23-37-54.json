        "content": "To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.\n\n1. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Rectangle:**\n\n   The perimeter of the rectangle is given to be equal to the sum of the lengths of all sides of a regular hexagon with each side measuring 3 cm.\n\n   The perimeter of the hexagon can be calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of hexagon} = 6 \\times \\text{side length} = 6 \\times 3 \\, \\text{cm} = 18 \\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangle is 18 cm.\n\n2. **Verify the Rectangle's Dimensions with Perimeter:**\n\n   The formula for the perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is:\n   \\[\n   P = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\n   \\]\n\n   Plugging in the values given for length and width:\n   \\[\n   18 = 2 \\times (5 + 2)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   18 = 2 \\times 7\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   18 = 14\n   \\]\n\n   It seems there is a discrepancy here with the given dimensions and calculated perimeter. However, since the problem states these dimensions, let's proceed with calculating the area.\n\n3. **Calculate the Area of the Rectangle:**\n\n   The area \\( A \\) of a rectangle is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   A = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   A = 5 \\, \\text{cm} \\times 2 \\, \\text{cm} = 10 \\, \\text{cm}^2\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the rectangle is \\( 10 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\)."
