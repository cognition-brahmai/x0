        "content": "In Python, the statement `import *` is used to import all public symbols from a module or package into the current namespace. However, its behavior can differ slightly depending on whether you're importing from a module or a package.\n\n1. **Modules**: When you use `from module_name import *`, Python imports all public attributes (functions, classes, variables, etc.) defined in that module. Public attributes are those that do not start with an underscore (`_`). If the module contains a special variable `__all__`, it will only import the attributes listed in that variable.\n\n2. **Packages**: A package is a directory containing an `__init__.py` file, which can also have other modules or sub-packages. When you use `from package_name import *`, Python will execute the `__init__.py` file of the package and import the public symbols defined there. If you want to ensure certain submodules or sub-packages are imported when using `import *`, you will need to explicitly import them in the `__init__.py` file or list them in the `__all__` variable within `__init__.py`.\n\nTo address your specific question: If `project.model` is a package, using `from project.model import *` will import everything defined in `project/model/__init__.py`. If `project.model` is a module, it will import all public symbols from that module.\n\nYou don't need to explicitly state `from project.model import __init__` if you want to import everything defined in `__init__.py` because `from project.model import *` already handles that, provided that the necessary symbols are exposed in `__init__.py`."
