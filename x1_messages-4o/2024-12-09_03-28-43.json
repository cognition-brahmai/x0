My understanding of the perceptron is that it has two inputs and uses a linear function, therefore it can solve linearly separable problems like AND and OR. I visualize it as substituting the two parts within the function separated by the + sign and by applying the step function, I get one of the clusters in respect to the input. However, since the function of an MLP is still linear, I am unsure how it can solve the XOR problem. Is it due to the interpolation of a polynomial?"

        "content": "The XOR problem is a classic example that illustrates the limitations of a single-layer perceptron and the power of a multilayer perceptron (MLP). Here's a mathematically correct explanation of why an MLP can solve the XOR problem:\n\n### XOR Problem Overview:\nThe XOR (exclusive OR) function is defined as follows for two binary inputs:\n- \\( XOR(0, 0) = 0 \\)\n- \\( XOR(0, 1) = 1 \\)\n- \\( XOR(1, 0) = 1 \\)\n- \\( XOR(1, 1) = 0 \\)\n\nThe challenge with XOR is that it is not linearly separable, meaning there is no straight line that can separate the classes (0 and 1) in a two-dimensional input space. A single-layer perceptron, which can only create linear decision boundaries, cannot solve this problem.\n\n### Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Solution:\nAn MLP consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The key feature of an MLP is the hidden layer, which allows the network to learn complex, non-linear decision boundaries.\n\n#### How MLP Solves XOR:\n1. **Hidden Layer Activation**: \n   - Introduce a hidden layer with, for example, two neurons. Each neuron in this hidden layer can learn a different linear combination of the inputs, effectively transforming the input space.\n   \n2. **Non-linear Transformation**:\n   - Apply a non-linear activation function (like a sigmoid or ReLU) at the hidden layer. This non-linearity allows the network to learn complex patterns.\n   \n3. **Creating Linearly Separable Space**:\n   - The hidden layer neurons can be thought of as creating new features that make the problem linearly separable. For instance, one neuron might learn to activate when the input is \\( (0,1) \\) or \\( (1,0) \\), while the other might learn a different combination.\n   \n   - For example, let's denote the outputs of the hidden neurons as \\( h_1 \\) and \\( h_2 \\):\n     - \\( h_1 = \\sigma(w_{11}x_1 + w_{12}x_2 + b_1) \\)\n     - \\( h_2 = \\sigma(w_{21}x_1 + w_{22}x_2 + b_2) \\)\n   - Here, \\( \\sigma \\) is the activation function, \\( w_{ij} \\) are weights, \\( x_i \\) are inputs, and \\( b_i \\) are biases.\n\n4. **Output Layer**:\n   - The output neuron takes inputs \\( h_1 \\) and \\( h_2 \\) and computes a weighted sum:\n     - \\( y = \\sigma(w_{o1}h_1 + w_{o2}h_2 + b_o) \\)\n   - With appropriate weights and bias, this setup can learn the XOR function.\n\n### Intuition:\n- The hidden layer effectively maps the non-linearly separable XOR problem into a higher-dimensional space where it becomes linearly separable. The non-linear activation functions in the hidden layer are crucial for this transformation.\n\n- By combining these transformed features in the output layer, the MLP can construct the decision boundary needed to solve the XOR problem.\n\nIn summary, the MLP uses its hidden layers and non-linear activation functions to transform the input space into a feature space where the XOR problem becomes linearly separable, allowing the network to solve it effectively. This ability to learn and model non-linear relationships is what makes MLPs powerful tools in machine learning."
