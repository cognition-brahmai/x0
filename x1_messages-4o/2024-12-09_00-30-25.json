When I try to use the 'long' function for variables 'b' and 'm' in my code, I am presented with a NameError: 'global name 'long' is not defined'. How can I resolve this issue? The problematic part of my code is as follows:\n\n```python\npower = long(b) % long(m)\n```"

        "content": "In Python 3, the `long` type was removed because Python 3's `int` type can handle arbitrarily large numbers, essentially incorporating the functionality of the old `long` type from Python 2. This means you don't need to convert your numbers to `long` in Python 3.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you should simply use the `int` type instead of `long`. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\npower = int(b) % int(m)\n```\n\nThis will work correctly in Python 3. If `b` and `m` are already integers, you might not even need to convert them explicitly, so you could just write:\n\n```python\npower = b % m\n```\n\nThis should fix the NameError you are encountering. If `b` and `m` are not integers, make sure they are converted to integers using `int()` before performing the modulo operation."
