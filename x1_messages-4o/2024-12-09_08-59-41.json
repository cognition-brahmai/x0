Here's a simple Go program that takes a sequence of characters as input and prints them in reverse order:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"bufio\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"os\"\n)\n\nfunc reverseString(s string) string {\n\trunes := []rune(s)\n\tn := len(runes)\n\tfor i := 0; i < n/2; i++ {\n\t\trunes[i], runes[n-1-i] = runes[n-1-i], runes[i]\n\t}\n\treturn string(runes)\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\treader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)\n\tfmt.Println(\"Enter a sequence of characters:\")\n\tinput, _ := reader.ReadString('\\n')\n\n\t// Remove the newline character from the input\n\tinput = input[:len(input)-1]\n\n\treversed := reverseString(input)\n\tfmt.Println(\"Reversed sequence:\", reversed)\n}\n```\n\n### How it Works:\n\n1. **Reading Input**: The program uses a buffered reader to read a sequence of characters from standard input.\n\n2. **Reversing the String**: The `reverseString` function converts the input string into a slice of runes, which allows it to handle multi-byte characters properly. It then swaps the elements from the start and end of the slice towards the center, effectively reversing the string.\n\n3. **Output**: Finally, the reversed string is printed to the console.\n\nYou can run this program in your Go environment. When you provide a sequence of characters, it will output them in reverse order."
