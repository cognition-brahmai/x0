        "content": "To print a string and a variable together in Python, you can use several methods. Here are three common approaches:\n\n1. **Using the `+` operator:**\n   You can concatenate strings with the `+` operator. However, you need to convert the variable to a string if it is not already one.\n\n   ```python\n   print(\"I have \" + str(card.price))\n   ```\n\n2. **Using f-strings (formatted string literals):**\n   This is available in Python 3.6 and later. It's a convenient and readable way to format strings.\n\n   ```python\n   print(f\"I have {card.price}\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Using the `format()` method:**\n   This method is compatible with older versions of Python (from 2.7 and 3.0 onwards).\n\n   ```python\n   print(\"I have {}\".format(card.price))\n   ```\n\n4. **Using the `%` operator:**\n   This is an older method of string formatting.\n\n   ```python\n   print(\"I have %s\" % card.price)\n   ```\n\nChoose the method that best suits your needs or the version of Python you are using. The f-string method is generally preferred for its readability and simplicity."
