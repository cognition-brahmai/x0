        "content": "Yes, you can find the union of two sets in a single line of code using a set comprehension, similar to your example for the intersection. Although the `|` operator is a straightforward way to find the union, you can achieve the same result by combining both sets in a set comprehension. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nS_union_T = {i for i in S} | {i for i in T}\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the `union` method:\n\n```python\nS_union_T = S.union(T)\n```\n\nIn your case, to stick closely to the style of using comprehensions, you could also do:\n\n```python\nS_union_T = {i for i in S} | {j for j in T}\n```\n\nThis uses set comprehensions to iterate over each set, although it's essentially combining the sets using `|`, but it demonstrates that you can iterate over both sets and combine their elements distinctly."
