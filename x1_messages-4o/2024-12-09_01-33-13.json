Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\ndef my_handle(self):\n    sentence = ' hello  apple  '\n    sentence = sentence.replace(' ', '')\n    return sentence\n```\n\nThis will remove all spaces from the string `sentence`, including those between the words. If you also need to remove other types of whitespace (like tabs or newlines), you can use a regular expression with the `re` module:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef my_handle(self):\n    sentence = ' hello  apple  \\n'\n    sentence = re.sub(r'\\s+', '', sentence)\n    return sentence\n```\n\nThe `re.sub(r'\\s+', '', sentence)` function will replace all whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.) with an empty string, effectively removing them from the sentence."
