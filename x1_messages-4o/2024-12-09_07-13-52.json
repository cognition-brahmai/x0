        "content": "The KeyError: 'TCL_Library' error typically occurs when cx_Freeze cannot find the necessary Tcl/Tk libraries, which are often required by Python's Tkinter module or by other libraries that depend on it.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Tcl/Tk is Installed**: Verify that Tcl/Tk is correctly installed on your system. On Windows, this is typically included with your Python installation. On macOS or Linux, you might need to install it separately.\n\n2. **Locate Tcl/Tk Libraries**: Find where Tcl and Tk libraries are located on your system. For Python installed via the official installer on Windows, they should be in a directory like this:  \n   - `C:\\Users\\<YourUsername>\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python<version>\\tcl\\tcl<version>`\n   - `C:\\Users\\<YourUsername>\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python<version>\\tcl\\tk<version>`\n\n3. **Update Setup Script**: Modify your `setup.py` script to include the paths to the Tcl/Tk libraries. You can add them to the `include_files` option:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   import sys\n   from cx_Freeze import setup, Executable\n\n   # Add paths for TCL and TK libraries\n   PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.__file__))\n   TCL_LIBRARY = os.path.join(PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR, 'tcl', 'tcl8.6')\n   TK_LIBRARY = os.path.join(PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR, 'tcl', 'tk8.6')\n   os.environ['TCL_LIBRARY'] = TCL_LIBRARY\n   os.environ['TK_LIBRARY'] = TK_LIBRARY\n\n   setup(\n       name=\"Snakes and Ladders\",\n       version=\"0.9\",\n       author=\"Adam\",\n       author_email=\"Omitted\",\n       options={\n           \"build_exe\": {\n               \"packages\": [\"pygame\"],\n               \"include_files\": [\n                   \"main.py\", \"squares.py\",\n                   \"pictures/Base Dice.png\", \"pictures/Dice 1.png\",\n                   \"pictures/Dice 2.png\", \"pictures/Dice 3.png\",\n                   \"pictures/Dice 4.png\", \"pictures/Dice 5.png\",\n                   \"pictures/Dice 6.png\",\n                   os.path.join(TCL_LIBRARY, \"tcl86t.dll\"),\n                   os.path.join(TK_LIBRARY, \"tk86t.dll\"),\n               ]\n           }\n       },\n       executables=[Executable(\"run.py\")],\n   )\n   ```\n\n4. **Rebuild Your Application**: After making the changes, rebuild your application using cx_Freeze.\n\n5. **Check Python Version**: Make sure the Python version you are using matches the Tcl/Tk versions. Sometimes version mismatches can cause this issue.\n\n6. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure that the `TCL_LIBRARY` and `TK_LIBRARY` environment variables are correctly set in your system. You can set them temporarily in your script as shown above or permanently in your system settings.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the KeyError and successfully build your application using cx_Freeze."
