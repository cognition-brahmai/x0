Additionally, implement a conditional statement within the loop that checks if the result is even or odd. If the result is even, append the string \"EVEN\" to the list. If the result is odd, append the string \"ODD\" to the list. Finally, print the list of results and their corresponding \"EVEN\" or \"ODD\" designation in a tabular format."
