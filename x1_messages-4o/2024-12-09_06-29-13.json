The underscore can be replaced with the dot (`.`) in regular expressions, which matches any single character. Here's how you can implement such a search:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Your list\nmy_list = ['this', 'is', 'just', 'a', 'test']\n\n# Function to perform wildcard search\ndef wildcard_search(search_term, lst):\n    # Replace the underscore with dot to match any single character\n    regex_pattern = '^' + search_term.replace('_', '.') + '$'\n    \n    # Compile the regex pattern\n    pattern = re.compile(regex_pattern)\n    \n    # Filter the list using the compiled pattern\n    matched_items = [item for item in lst if pattern.match(item)]\n    \n    return matched_items\n\n# Example usage\nsearch_term = 'th_s'\nresults = wildcard_search(search_term, my_list)\nprint(\"Matched items:\", results)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- The `wildcard_search` function takes a search term and a list as arguments.\n- The underscore in the search term is replaced with a dot (`.`) to create a regular expression pattern that matches any single character.\n- The `re.compile` function compiles the regex pattern.\n- A list comprehension is used to filter and return items from the list that match the pattern.\n\nIf you run this with the example search term `'th_s'`, it will return `['this']`."
