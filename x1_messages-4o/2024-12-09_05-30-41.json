        "content": "Certainly! Let's break down the one-liner `rotated = zip(*original[::-1])` to understand how it rotates a two-dimensional array (or list of lists) in Python.\n\n1. **`original[::-1]`**:\n   - This part of the code is using Python's slicing feature. The slice `[::-1]` creates a reversed version of the `original` list. If `original` is a list of lists (a 2D array), this operation reverses the order of the rows. For example, if `original` is:\n\n     ```\n     [\n       [1, 2, 3],\n       [4, 5, 6],\n       [7, 8, 9]\n     ]\n     ```\n\n     Then `original[::-1]` would be:\n\n     ```\n     [\n       [7, 8, 9],\n       [4, 5, 6],\n       [1, 2, 3]\n     ]\n     ```\n\n2. **`*` (unpacking operator)**:\n   - The `*` operator is used to unpack the elements of the list. When used in a function call, it unpacks the list so that each row is passed as a separate argument to the function. Essentially, it is equivalent to passing each row of the reversed array as separate arguments to `zip`.\n\n3. **`zip()`**:\n   - The `zip` function takes multiple iterables (in this case, the rows of the reversed array) and aggregates them into tuples, where each tuple contains the i-th element from each of the argument sequences.\n   - When used with the unpacked reversed array, `zip` effectively transposes the array. That is, it switches rows with columns.\n\n   Continuing with our example, `zip(*original[::-1])` would work as follows:\n\n   - The reversed array is:\n     ```\n     [\n       [7, 8, 9],\n       [4, 5, 6],\n       [1, 2, 3]\n     ]\n     ```\n\n   - `zip` will take:\n     - The first elements from each row: `(7, 4, 1)`\n     - The second elements from each row: `(8, 5, 2)`\n     - The third elements from each row: `(9, 6, 3)`\n\n   The result of `zip` is a series of tuples that represent the rotated array. If you convert these tuples back to lists, you get the rotated array:\n\n   ```\n   [\n     [7, 4, 1],\n     [8, 5, 2],\n     [9, 6, 3]\n   ]\n   ```\n\nThis is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the original array. If you want the result as a list of lists instead of a list of tuples, you can wrap the `zip` call with `list()` and a nested comprehension, like so:\n\n```python\nrotated = [list(row) for row in zip(*original[::-1])]\n```\n\nThis will convert each tuple produced by `zip` back into a list."
