However, I can provide a sample JSON format with a few entries to illustrate how the data could be structured:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"Albert Einstein\",\n        \"Year\": 1921,\n        \"Country\": \"Germany\",\n        \"Contribution\": \"For his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"Marie Curie\",\n        \"Year\": 1903,\n        \"Country\": \"France\",\n        \"Contribution\": \"In recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the radiation phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"Richard Feynman\",\n        \"Year\": 1965,\n        \"Country\": \"United States\",\n        \"Contribution\": \"For their fundamental work in quantum electrodynamics, with deep-ploughing consequences for the physics of elementary particles.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"Peter Higgs\",\n        \"Year\": 2013,\n        \"Country\": \"United Kingdom\",\n        \"Contribution\": \"For the theoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic particles, and which recently was confirmed through the discovery of the predicted fundamental particle, by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN's Large Hadron Collider.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"Donna Strickland\",\n        \"Year\": 2018,\n        \"Country\": \"Canada\",\n        \"Contribution\": \"For their method of generating high-intensity, ultra-short optical pulses.\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\nThis is a simplified example. For a complete list, you would need to compile data from a reliable source, such as the official Nobel Prize website or a dedicated database, and format it similarly."
