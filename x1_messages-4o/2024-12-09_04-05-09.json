I'd prefer it to be expanded into columns. \n\nAdditionally, I would like to keep the \"number\", \"date\", \"name\", and \"locations\" column. However, I need to join the locations. Here's what I have tried:\n\n```\nallLocations = \"\"\nisFirst = True\nfor location in result.locations:\n    if isFirst:\n        isFirst = False\n        allLocations = location['name']\n    else:\n        allLocations += \"; \" + location['name']\nallLocations\n```\n\nBut this approach does not seem to be efficient or in pandas style."

        "content": "To efficiently handle nested JSON structures and expand them into a more usable tabular form with pandas, you'll want to flatten the JSON structure. For the specific requirement of expanding the \"locations\" array into a single column with concatenated values, you can use pandas' `json_normalize` function along with some additional data manipulation techniques. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Read the JSON File**: Use `pd.read_json` to read your JSON file into a pandas DataFrame.\n\n2. **Normalize the JSON**: Use `json_normalize` to flatten the \"locations\" field.\n\n3. **Concatenate Locations**: Concatenate the location names into a single string for each record.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport json\n\n# Load the JSON data\nwith open('/myJson.json') as f:\n    data = json.load(f)\n\n# Use json_normalize to flatten the JSON\ndf = pd.json_normalize(data, record_path=['locations'], meta=['number', 'date', 'name'], errors='ignore')\n\n# Group by 'number', 'date', and 'name' and concatenate 'name' from locations\ndf_concatenated = df.groupby(['number', 'date', 'name'])['name'].apply(lambda x: '; '.join(x)).reset_index()\n\n# Rename the concatenated column to 'locations'\ndf_concatenated.rename(columns={'name': 'locations'}, inplace=True)\n\nprint(df_concatenated)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`json_normalize`**: This function helps to flatten the nested structure in JSON. The `record_path` parameter specifies the path to the nested array you want to expand, and `meta` allows you to keep other fields alongside.\n\n- **Grouping and Concatenation**: After flattening, the DataFrame is grouped by the unique identifiers ('number', 'date', 'name'), and the names within \"locations\" are concatenated into a single string using `'; '.join(x)`.\n\nThis `pandas`-oriented method is efficient and leverages vectorized operations, which are generally faster and more idiomatic than Python loops and manual string concatenation."
