Using the list of numbers [2, 8, 1, 7, 4, 5, 6, 3], create a new list by multiplying each number by its corresponding index position (starting at 1). Then, calculate the sum of all the numbers in the new list. Finally, divide the sum by the difference between the maximum and minimum numbers in the original list. What is the final result rounded to the nearest hundredth?"
