        "content": "How can I read a Python tuple using PyYAML? I have a YAML file named \"input.yaml\" which contains some data. When I load this data using PyYAML and print the result, each city and highway is represented as a list. However, I want them to be represented as a tuple. I can manually convert them into tuples using comprehensions, but this seems like a workaround. Is there a way to instruct PyYAML to directly read them as tuples instead of lists? \n\nThe current code I am using to load the data from the YAML file is:\n\n```python\nimport yaml\n\nf = open(\"input.yaml\", \"r\")\ndata = yaml.load(f)\nf.close()\n\nprint(data)\n```\n\nAnd the code I am using to convert the lists into tuples is:\n\n```python\nimport yaml\n\nf = open(\"input.yaml\", \"r\")\ndata = yaml.load(f)\nf.close()\n\ndata[\"cities\"] = {k: tuple(v) for k, v in data[\"cities\"].items()}\ndata[\"highways\"] = [tuple(v) for v in data[\"highways\"]]\n\nprint(data)\n```"

        "content": "To handle this directly while loading the YAML data, you can customize the way PyYAML parses lists by overriding the default constructor for sequences. This allows you to transform the sequences into tuples as they are being loaded. Here's a way to achieve that:\n\n```python\nimport yaml\n\n# Define a custom constructor for YAML sequences to be loaded as tuples\ndef tuple_constructor(loader, node):\n    return tuple(loader.construct_sequence(node))\n\n# Register the constructor for YAML sequences (represented by 'tag:yaml.org,2002:seq')\nyaml.add_constructor('tag:yaml.org,2002:seq', tuple_constructor)\n\n# Load the YAML file with the custom constructor\nwith open(\"input.yaml\", \"r\") as f:\n    data = yaml.load(f, Loader=yaml.Loader)\n\nprint(data)\n```\n\nThis solution modifies the PyYAML behavior, such that whenever it encounters a sequence (which is typically loaded as a list), it will instead construct a tuple. This way, you don't need to manually convert lists to tuples after loading the data. Just ensure that this change aligns with your overall data processing needs, as it will apply globally to all sequences in the loaded YAML data."
