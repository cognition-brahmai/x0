I have also used an AMD cpu with numpy 1.6.1 compiled with `gcc` without `mkl` to verify the timings. The results show that `np.einsum` is at least twice as fast for all these operations. The only exception is `np.dot` as it calls DGEMM from a BLAS library. Why is `np.einsum` faster than other numpy functions that are equivalent?"

        "content": "The performance difference you're observing with `np.einsum` compared to other NumPy functions can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. **Flexibility and Optimization**: `np.einsum` provides a highly flexible interface that allows for specifying operations in a concise Einstein summation notation. This flexibility enables `einsum` to optimize the computation more effectively than some other functions. It can eliminate unnecessary intermediate steps and reduce the overhead associated with temporary array creation.\n\n2. **Memory Efficiency**: `einsum` often reduces the need for creating intermediate arrays, which can be a significant factor in performance, especially for large data sets. By minimizing memory usage, it reduces the data movement overhead and cache misses, leading to faster execution.\n\n3. **Vectorization and Parallelization**: `einsum` can take advantage of vectorized operations and parallelization more effectively. When linked with optimized libraries like MKL, it can leverage SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions and parallel processing capabilities of modern CPUs to improve performance.\n\n4. **BLAS and Specialized Algorithms**: Although `np.dot` is typically optimized due to its reliance on BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms), `einsum` can sometimes outperform other operations by using specialized algorithms that are better suited for the specific contraction patterns, especially if the operation doesn't map directly to a simple matrix multiplication.\n\n5. **Advanced Compiler Optimizations**: When compiled with advanced compilers and linked to highly optimized libraries like Intel's MKL, `einsum` can benefit from aggressive compiler optimizations, further enhancing performance.\n\nIn summary, `np.einsum` can outperform other NumPy functions due to its ability to optimize operations by reducing memory overhead, leveraging advanced hardware instructions, and making use of highly optimized computational libraries. This makes it an excellent choice for performing complex tensor contractions and operations efficiently."
