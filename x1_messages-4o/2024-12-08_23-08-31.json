After running for 30 minutes, you have burnt 300 calories. After cycling for 45 minutes, you have burnt 400 calories. What percentage of your total goal have you achieved, and how much more do you need to burn through swimming to reach your target? If you plan to burn 25% more calories through swimming than running, how long should you swim to reach your goal?"

        "content": "To determine the percentage of your total goal achieved and how much more you need to burn through swimming, we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Total Calories Burned So Far**:\n   - Calories burned from running: 300 calories\n   - Calories burned from cycling: 400 calories\n   - Total calories burned: 300 + 400 = 700 calories\n\n2. **Percentage of Goal Achieved**:\n   - Your goal is to burn 1000 calories.\n   - Percentage achieved = (Total calories burned / Goal) \u00d7 100\n   - Percentage achieved = (700 / 1000) \u00d7 100 = 70%\n\n3. **Calories Remaining to Burn**:\n   - Total goal: 1000 calories\n   - Calories burned so far: 700 calories\n   - Calories remaining = 1000 - 700 = 300 calories\n\n4. **Calories to Burn through Swimming**:\n   - You plan to burn 25% more calories through swimming than running.\n   - Calories burned through running: 300 calories\n   - Additional 25%: 300 \u00d7 0.25 = 75 calories\n   - Total calories to burn through swimming: 300 + 75 = 375 calories\n\n5. **How Long to Swim**:\n   - To determine how long you should swim, you need to know the rate at which you burn calories while swimming. This rate depends on factors like your weight, swimming intensity, and style. However, a general estimate is around 500 calories per hour for moderate-intensity swimming.\n   - If you burn approximately 500 calories per hour, then:\n     - Calories to burn: 375 calories\n     - Time required = (Calories to burn / Calories burned per hour)\n     - Time required = 375 / 500 = 0.75 hours = 45 minutes\n\nTherefore, you have achieved 70% of your goal, and you need to burn an additional 375 calories through swimming. To reach your target, you should swim for approximately 45 minutes, assuming you burn about 500 calories per hour while swimming."
