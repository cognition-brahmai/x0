However, it sometimes runs into an infinite loop or executes for too long, such as with `PyRun_SimpleString(\"while 1: pass\")`. To prevent the main program from blocking, I am considering running the interpreter in a thread. How can I stop executing the Python script in the embedded interpreter running in a thread without killing the whole process? Is it possible to pass an exception to the interpreter? Should I wrap the script under some other script which would listen for signals? I could run the Python in a separate process, but I'd prefer not to unless it's a last resort."

        "content": "To safely interrupt an embedded Python interpreter running in a separate thread without terminating the entire process, you can take the following approach:\n\n1. **Use a separate thread for the Python interpreter**: Run your Python script in a dedicated thread so that your main application remains responsive.\n\n2. **Thread management**: Use Python's built-in threading mechanisms to control execution. You can start the interpreter in a new thread with something like:\n\n   ```c\n   #include <Python.h>\n   #include <pthread.h>\n   #include <signal.h>\n\n   volatile int stop_script = 0;\n\n   void* run_python_script(void* arg) {\n       PyGILState_STATE gstate;\n       gstate = PyGILState_Ensure();\n\n       PyRun_SimpleString((const char*)arg);\n\n       PyGILState_Release(gstate);\n       return NULL;\n   }\n\n   void signal_handler(int signum) {\n       stop_script = 1;\n   }\n\n   int main() {\n       Py_Initialize();\n       signal(SIGINT, signal_handler);\n\n       pthread_t thread;\n       const char* script = \"while True: pass\";\n\n       pthread_create(&thread, NULL, run_python_script, (void*)script);\n\n       // Monitor the script or other conditions to decide when to stop\n       while (1) {\n           if (stop_script) {\n               // Issue an interrupt to the thread running the Python interpreter\n               PyGILState_STATE gstate;\n               gstate = PyGILState_Ensure();\n               PyErr_SetInterrupt();\n               PyGILState_Release(gstate);\n               break;\n           }\n       }\n\n       pthread_join(thread, NULL);\n       Py_Finalize();\n       return 0;\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Signal interruption**: Use `PyErr_SetInterrupt()` to simulate a keyboard interrupt (like pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal). This raises a `KeyboardInterrupt` in the Python interpreter.\n\n4. **Handling exceptions in Python**: Ensure your Python code can handle exceptions properly. If the script is expected to handle an interruption, it should catch `KeyboardInterrupt`:\n\n   ```python\n   try:\n       while True:\n           pass\n   except KeyboardInterrupt:\n       print(\"Script interrupted!\")\n   ```\n\n5. **Graceful shutdown**: Make sure your C code can gracefully handle the shutdown of the Python interpreter, especially when it's interrupted, to avoid resource leaks or undefined behavior.\n\nThis approach allows you to stop the execution of the Python code running in a separate thread without terminating the main application. However, it requires careful management of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) to safely interact with Python objects from multiple threads."
