My directory structure looks like this:\n\n```\nsrc\n |\n --ShutterDeck\n    |\n    --Helper\n       |\n       --User.py -> class User\n    --Controller\n       |\n       --User.py -> class User\n```\n\nThe `src` directory is in `PYTHONPATH`. In a different file, say `main.py`, I want to access both `User` classes. How can I do this? When I try to call the User classes as controllers and helpers, I receive an `AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'User'`. Why is this error occurring given that the directories `ShutterDeck`, `Helper` and `Controller` all have `__init__.py` in them?"

        "content": "When you encounter an `AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'User'`, it typically means there's an issue with how the module or class is being imported or accessed. Given your directory structure and the fact that you've ensured the presence of `__init__.py` files, let's go over a few steps to correctly import and access both `User` classes.\n\n### Directory Structure Recap:\n\n```\nsrc/\n \u2514\u2500\u2500 ShutterDeck/\n     \u251c\u2500\u2500 Controller/\n     \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 User.py  -> class User\n     \u2514\u2500\u2500 Helper/\n         \u2514\u2500\u2500 User.py  -> class User\n```\n\n### Correct Import Statements\n\nTo import both `User` classes, you need to specify the full package path to avoid any conflicts. Here\u2019s how you can do it in your `main.py`:\n\n```python\n# Import User class from ShutterDeck.Helper.User\nfrom ShutterDeck.Helper.User import User as HelperUser\n\n# Import User class from ShutterDeck.Controller.User\nfrom ShutterDeck.Controller.User import User as ControllerUser\n\n# Now you can use HelperUser and ControllerUser to refer to the respective classes\nhelper_user_instance = HelperUser()\ncontroller_user_instance = ControllerUser()\n```\n\n### Why the Error Occurred\n\n1. **Import Path Issues**: If you were using a relative import or an incorrect path, Python might not have been able to locate the module or class properly.\n\n2. **Name Conflicts**: Simply using `from ShutterDeck.User import User` without specifying the sub-packages (`Helper` or `Controller`) would have led to ambiguity and conflicts.\n\n3. **Module vs. Class Name**: When you import using `import ShutterDeck.Helper.User`, you need to reference the class within using `ShutterDeck.Helper.User.User`, which can be cumbersome and error-prone if not done correctly.\n\n### Ensuring Proper Imports\n\n- **Ensure PYTHONPATH**: Make sure your `src` directory is properly included in the `PYTHONPATH`. This can be done by setting the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable or by running your script from the `src` directory.\n\n- **Check `__init__.py`**: Make sure the `__init__.py` files are present and correctly set up to indicate that directories are packages.\n\nWith these steps, you should be able to import and use the classes without any issues."
