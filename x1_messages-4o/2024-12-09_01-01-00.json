        "content": "To assert that two lists contain the same elements regardless of their order, converting them to sets is indeed a straightforward approach, as sets inherently disregard order and duplicate elements. However, if you want to ensure that both the frequency of elements and the elements themselves are the same in both lists, you should use the `collections.Counter` class, which counts the frequency of each element in the lists. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef assert_lists_equal(list1, list2):\n    assert Counter(list1) == Counter(list2), \"The lists do not contain the same elements.\"\n\n# Example usage:\nlist1 = [1, 2, 2, 3]\nlist2 = [3, 2, 1, 2]\n\nassert_lists_equal(list1, list2)  # This will pass\n\nlist3 = [1, 2, 3]\nassert_lists_equal(list1, list3)  # This will raise an AssertionError\n```\n\nThis method not only checks that the lists contain the same elements, but also ensures that each element appears the same number of times in both lists. This is particularly useful in test cases where both order and frequency need to be considered."
