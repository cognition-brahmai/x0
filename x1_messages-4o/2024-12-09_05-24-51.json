        "content": "To tokenize a string containing a mathematical expression in Python, you can use regular expressions to split the string into components like numbers and operators. Here's a simple way to do it using the `re` module:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef tokenize(expression):\n    # Define a regular expression pattern to match numbers and operators\n    pattern = r'(\\d+|\\+|\\-|\\*|\\/)'\n\n    # Use re.findall to find all matches in the expression\n    tokens = re.findall(pattern, expression)\n\n    return tokens\n\n# Example usage\nexpression = \"2+24*48/32\"\ntokens = tokenize(expression)\nprint(tokens)  # Output: ['2', '+', '24', '*', '48', '/', '32']\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n- `\\d+`: Matches one or more digits, capturing numbers.\n- `|\\+|\\-|\\*|\\/`: Matches any of the operators (+, -, *, /).\n- `re.findall(pattern, expression)`: Finds all occurrences of the pattern in the expression and returns them as a list.\n\nThis approach assumes that the expression contains only numbers and the basic arithmetic operators. If you need to handle more complex expressions with parentheses or other operators, you may need to extend the regular expression pattern accordingly."
