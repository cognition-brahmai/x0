        "content": "To create an algorithm that filters out dates coinciding with meteor showers or eclipses and only displays dates falling on a full moon or new moon during those events, we can follow a structured approach. Here are the steps to develop this algorithm:\n\n1. **Data Collection:**\n   - Gather a list of meteor showers and eclipse dates.\n   - Gather moon phase data, specifically noting the dates of full moons and new moons.\n\n2. **Data Structure:**\n   - Use a dictionary or a database to store the dates of meteor showers, eclipses, full moons, and new moons with their respective information.\n\n3. **Algorithm Steps:**\n\n   a. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n      - Create lists or dictionaries to hold meteor shower dates, eclipse dates, full moon dates, and new moon dates.\n\n   b. **Filter Relevant Events:**\n      - Loop through each date in the meteor shower and eclipse lists.\n      - For each date, check if it coincides with a full moon or new moon date.\n      - If it coincides, add it to a new list or dictionary that holds relevant events.\n\n   c. **Sort the Dates:**\n      - Once filtered, sort the dates based on the moon phase.\n      - You can prioritize full moons over new moons or vice versa, depending on the requirement.\n\n4. **Implementation:**\n\n```python\n# Sample Data (Replace with actual data)\nmeteor_showers = {\n    '2023-11-17': 'Leonids',\n    '2023-12-14': 'Geminids',\n    # Add more meteor showers\n}\n\neclipses = {\n    '2023-11-08': 'Lunar Eclipse',\n    '2023-12-04': 'Solar Eclipse',\n    # Add more eclipses\n}\n\nmoon_phases = {\n    '2023-11-08': 'Full Moon',\n    '2023-12-04': 'New Moon',\n    # Add more moon phases\n}\n\n# Filtered Events\nfiltered_events = []\n\n# Filter Dates\nfor date, event in {**meteor_showers, **eclipses}.items():\n    if date in moon_phases:\n        moon_phase = moon_phases[date]\n        filtered_events.append((date, event, moon_phase))\n\n# Sort Events by Moon Phase (Full Moon first)\nsorted_filtered_events = sorted(filtered_events, key=lambda x: (x[2] == 'New Moon', x[0]))\n\n# Display Results\nfor date, event, moon_phase in sorted_filtered_events:\n    print(f\"Date: {date}, Event: {event}, Moon Phase: {moon_phase}\")\n```\n\n5. **Considerations:**\n   - Ensure the date format is consistent throughout the data.\n   - This algorithm assumes that the data is accurate and up-to-date.\n   - You may need to adjust the sorting logic based on specific requirements, such as prioritizing certain events or moon phases.\n\nThis approach will help you filter and display only the relevant dates that coincide with meteor showers or eclipses and fall on a full moon or new moon, sorted by the moon phase."
