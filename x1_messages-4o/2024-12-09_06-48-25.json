When I try to use np.concatenate([array1, array2]), I get a ValueError stating \"all the input arrays must have same number of dimensions\". The arrays I'm using are as follows:\n\nFirst np.array with a shape (5,4):\n```python\n[[  6487    400 489580      0]\n [  6488    401 492994      0]\n [  6491    408 489247      0]\n [  6491    408 489247      0]\n [  6492    402 499013      0]]\n```\nSecond np.array with a shape (5,):\n```python\n[  16.   15.   12.  12.  17. ]\n```\nThe final result should be:\n```python\n[[  6487    400    489580    0   16]\n [  6488    401    492994    0   15]\n [  6491    408    489247    0   12]\n [  6491    408    489247    0   12]\n [  6492    402    499013    0   17]]\n```\nWhat am I doing wrong?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is due to the mismatch in dimensions between the two arrays. The first array has a shape of `(5, 4)` and the second array has a shape of `(5,)`. To concatenate them, you need to ensure that both arrays have the same number of dimensions.\n\nYou can solve this by reshaping the second array to have a shape of `(5, 1)`, which makes it compatible for horizontal concatenation with the first array. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the arrays\narray1 = np.array([\n    [6487, 400, 489580, 0],\n    [6488, 401, 492994, 0],\n    [6491, 408, 489247, 0],\n    [6491, 408, 489247, 0],\n    [6492, 402, 499013, 0]\n])\n\narray2 = np.array([16, 15, 12, 12, 17])\n\n# Reshape the second array to (5, 1)\narray2_reshaped = array2.reshape(5, 1)\n\n# Concatenate the arrays along the second axis (horizontally)\nresult = np.concatenate([array1, array2_reshaped], axis=1)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will give you the desired output:\n\n```python\n[[  6487    400 489580      0     16]\n [  6488    401 492994      0     15]\n [  6491    408 489247      0     12]\n [  6491    408 489247      0     12]\n [  6492    402 499013      0     17]]\n```\n\nBy reshaping `array2` to `(5, 1)`, you're effectively adding a second dimension, which allows it to be concatenated horizontally with `array1`."
