I attempted to resolve this by using `variable = int(stringToInt) or None` but it results in an error if the string is empty. How can I set my variable to `None` if the string is empty without running into an error?"

Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nstringToInt = \"your_string_here\"  # Replace this with your actual string\n\nvariable = int(stringToInt) if stringToInt else None\n```\n\nThis code checks if `stringToInt` is not empty. If it's not empty, it converts it to an integer using `int(stringToInt)`. If it is empty, it sets `variable` to `None`. This approach prevents the error you were encountering when trying to convert an empty string to an integer."
