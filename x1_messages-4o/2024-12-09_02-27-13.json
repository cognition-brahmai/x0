As this file is growing, I want to split each class into multiple files for better organization. My initial idea was to create a `model` directory with `__init__.py`, `foo.py`, and `bar.py` files. However, this would require me to refer to the classes as `model.foo.Foo()`. Is there a way to split the classes into multiple files but still refer to them as `model.Foo()`? Furthermore, I should be able to extend or use `Foo` inside `Bar`."

        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this by restructuring your code into a package and using the `__init__.py` file to make the classes accessible at the module level. Here's how you can organize your files:\n\n1. Create a `model` directory.\n2. Inside the `model` directory, create three files: `__init__.py`, `foo.py`, and `bar.py`.\n\nHere's how the structure would look:\n\n```\nmodel/\n    __init__.py\n    foo.py\n    bar.py\n```\n\n### foo.py\n\nIn `foo.py`, define your `Foo` class:\n\n```python\nclass Foo:\n    def __init__(self):\n        print(\"Foo initialized\")\n\n    def do_something(self):\n        print(\"Doing something in Foo\")\n```\n\n### bar.py\n\nIn `bar.py`, define your `Bar` class and import `Foo` if needed:\n\n```python\nfrom .foo import Foo  # Relative import\n\nclass Bar:\n    def __init__(self):\n        print(\"Bar initialized\")\n\n    def do_something(self):\n        print(\"Doing something in Bar\")\n        foo_instance = Foo()\n        foo_instance.do_something()\n```\n\n### __init__.py\n\nIn `__init__.py`, import the classes from `foo.py` and `bar.py` so they can be accessed directly from the `model` package:\n\n```python\nfrom .foo import Foo\nfrom .bar import Bar\n\n__all__ = [\"Foo\", \"Bar\"]  # Optional: This defines what is exported when using 'from model import *'\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nNow, when you import the `model` package, you can access the classes as `model.Foo` and `model.Bar`:\n\n```python\nimport model\n\nfoo_instance = model.Foo()\nfoo_instance.do_something()\n\nbar_instance = model.Bar()\nbar_instance.do_something()\n```\n\nWith this setup, you can keep your classes organized in separate files while maintaining the simplicity of accessing them through `model.Foo()` and `model.Bar()`. This also allows `Bar` to extend or use `Foo` without any issues."
