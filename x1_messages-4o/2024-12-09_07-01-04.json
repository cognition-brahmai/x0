For instance, consider the following example:\n```python\ndef add(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\nadd_5 = magic_function(add, 5)\nassert add_5(3) == 8\n```\nIn this case, what would be the `magic_function` required to achieve this? This often happens with frameworks and libraries where people mistakenly call a function immediately when trying to give arguments to a callback, for example `on_event(action(foo))`. The solution is to bind `foo` as an argument to `action` using one of the techniques that could be suggested. Explicitly binding arguments is also a way to avoid problems caused by late binding when using closures."

        "content": "To achieve the behavior you're describing, you can use a concept known as \"partial function application.\" Python provides a convenient tool for this in the `functools` module called `partial`. The `partial` function allows you to fix a certain number of arguments of your function and generate a new function. This is a form of currying.\n\nHere's how you can implement your `magic_function` using `functools.partial`:\n\n```python\nfrom functools import partial\n\ndef add(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\n# This is equivalent to your desired `magic_function`.\ndef magic_function(func, *args, **kwargs):\n    return partial(func, *args, **kwargs)\n\n# Bind 5 as the first argument to the `add` function.\nadd_5 = magic_function(add, 5)\n\n# Now you can call `add_5` with one argument, and it will add 5 to it.\nassert add_5(3) == 8\n```\n\nIn this example, `magic_function` uses `functools.partial` to create a new function where some of the arguments are pre-filled. You can use it to bind any number of arguments and/or keyword arguments. When you call the new function, it only requires the remaining arguments that were not pre-filled.\n\nThis technique is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to pass functions as callbacks with certain pre-set arguments, as you mentioned. It helps in avoiding issues related to late binding with closures by explicitly setting the arguments when creating the partial function."
