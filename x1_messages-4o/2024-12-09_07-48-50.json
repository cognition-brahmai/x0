Specifically, I have a model where one character field is listed in `unique_together` and requires an index for quick lookups. I understand that it would not cause any issues to add a duplicate `db_index=True` in the field definition, but I am curious if `unique_together` inherently implies `db_index=True`."

        "content": "In Django, the `unique_together` option is used to enforce a unique constraint on a combination of fields. When you specify `unique_together` for a set of fields, Django ensures that the combination of values in these fields is unique across the entire table.\n\nRegarding indexing, `unique_together` does imply an index, but it is a composite index that covers all the fields specified in the `unique_together` constraint. This composite index is used to enforce the uniqueness constraint and can also improve query performance when filtering by all the fields in the `unique_together` constraint.\n\nHowever, if you need an index on just one of the fields included in the `unique_together` constraint (for example, for quick lookups on that single field), you will need to add a separate index for that field using `db_index=True` in the field definition.\n\nIn summary, `unique_together` creates a composite index for the specified fields, but it does not automatically create individual indexes for each field. If you need an index on an individual field for performance reasons, you should explicitly add `db_index=True` to that field's definition."
