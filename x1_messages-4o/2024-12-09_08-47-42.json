        "content": "To develop a Java class that calculates the sum of the elements of an array, you can follow these steps. Here's a simple example of how you might implement such a class:\n\n```java\npublic class ArraySumCalculator {\n\n    // Method to calculate the sum of elements in an array\n    public static int calculateSum(int[] array) {\n        int sum = 0;\n        for (int element : array) {\n            sum += element; // Add each element to the sum\n        }\n        return sum;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Example usage\n        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n        int sum = calculateSum(numbers);\n        System.out.println(\"The sum of the array elements is: \" + sum);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Class Definition**: We define a class named `ArraySumCalculator`.\n\n2. **calculateSum Method**: This static method takes an array of integers as a parameter and calculates the sum:\n   - It initializes a variable `sum` to zero.\n   - It iterates over each element in the array using an enhanced for-loop.\n   - It adds each element to the `sum`.\n\n3. **main Method**: This is the entry point of the program:\n   - An example array `numbers` is defined.\n   - The `calculateSum` method is called with `numbers` as an argument.\n   - The result is printed to the console.\n\nThis example demonstrates how you can encapsulate the functionality of summing an array within a class method, making it reusable and easy to test. You can modify the `calculateSum` method to handle different types of arrays or to include additional features, such as handling null arrays or logging each step of the calculation."
