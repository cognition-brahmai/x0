For instance, if I have a command like `ls $DIRNAME`, I would like the script to not only run the command but also display `ls /full/path/to/some/dir`. Is there a way to generate a log of all shell commands called and their arguments?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this using the `set` built-in command in your shell script. By using `set -x`, the shell will display each command before executing it, and it will also expand any variables. Here's how you can modify your shell script to enable this feature:\n\n1. Add `set -x` at the beginning of your script. This will turn on debugging mode and display each command with expanded variables as it is executed.\n2. If you want to disable this feature at any point in the script, you can use `set +x`.\n\nHere is an example of how your script might look:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Enable debugging mode\nset -x\n\n# Your shell commands\nDIRNAME=\"/full/path/to/some/dir\"\nls $DIRNAME\n\n# Disable debugging mode if needed\n#set +x\n```\n\nThis will output each command with all variables expanded as they are executed. The `set -x` command is especially useful for debugging scripts to see what commands are being run and with what arguments.\n\nIf you want to log these commands to a file, you can redirect the output of the script to a file when you run it. For example:\n\n```bash\n./yourscript.sh > script.log 2>&1\n```\n\nThis command will redirect both standard output and standard error to `script.log`, allowing you to review the execution log later."
