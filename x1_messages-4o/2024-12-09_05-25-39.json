        "content": "The difference between `sorted(list)` and `list.sort()` primarily lies in their behavior and usage:\n\n1. **`sorted(list)`**:\n   - **Returns a New List**: It returns a new list that is sorted, leaving the original list unchanged.\n   - **Can be Used with Any Iterable**: It can be used with any iterable, not just lists (e.g., tuples, strings, etc.).\n   - **Syntax Flexibility**: Since it returns a new list, it can be used in expressions or directly within other functions.\n   - **Preferred When**: You want to keep the original list intact or when you need to sort iterables other than lists.\n\n2. **`list.sort()`**:\n   - **In-Place Sorting**: It sorts the list in place and returns `None`, modifying the original list.\n   - **Only for Lists**: This method is specifically for list objects.\n   - **Efficiency**: Because it sorts in place, it is generally more memory-efficient since it doesn't create a new list.\n   - **Preferred When**: You want to sort a list and do not need to retain the original order.\n\n**Efficiency**:\n- In terms of time complexity, both `sorted()` and `list.sort()` have the same average and worst-case time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of elements. However, `list.sort()` may be slightly more efficient in terms of memory usage since it doesn't create a new list.\n\n**Reverting to Original State**:\n- Once `list.sort()` is performed, the original order of the list is lost unless you have previously saved a copy of the original list. To revert to the unsorted state, you would need to have stored the original list in a variable before sorting and then use that stored copy to restore the list to its original order.\n\nIn summary, use `sorted(list)` when you need a sorted version of the list but also want to keep the original list unchanged. Use `list.sort()` when you are okay with modifying the original list and want to save memory."
