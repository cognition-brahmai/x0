I have two example sets as follows:\n\n```python\nexample1 = {1, 2, 7, False}\nexample2 = {7, 2, 4, 1, True}\n```\nWhen I print these sets, the output is:\n```python\nprint(example1) # Outputs: {False, 1, 2, 7}\nprint(example2) # Outputs: {1, 2, 4, 7}\n```\nYou can see that False is included in the first set, but True is not included in the second set. Can you explain why this is happening?"

        "content": "This behavior you're observing is due to how Python handles boolean values and integers in sets. In Python, the boolean values `True` and `False` are actually special cases of the integers 1 and 0, respectively. This means that `True` is equivalent to 1 and `False` is equivalent to 0.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. In your first set `example1 = {1, 2, 7, False}`, `False` is equivalent to 0. Since 0 is not present in the set, it is added successfully. That's why when you print `example1`, you see `{False, 1, 2, 7}`.\n\n2. In your second set `example2 = {7, 2, 4, 1, True}`, `True` is equivalent to 1. Since 1 is already present in the set, adding `True` does not change the set. Sets automatically handle duplicates, so when you try to add `True` (which is 1), it doesn't add a new element because 1 is already present.\n\nThis is why `True` seems to be missing from `example2` when printed. Essentially, the integer 1 is already present in the set, and thus, `True` (which is also 1) doesn't appear as a separate element.\n\nTo see this in action:\n- If you try adding both `0` and `False` to a set, you will only see one `False` (or 0) in the set.\n- Similarly, adding both `1` and `True` results in only one `1` (or True) in the set.\n\nIf you want to ensure you explicitly see the boolean values, you might need to handle them separately from integers in your logic."
