Could I be overlooking some basic syntax?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to the version of Python you're using. The f-string syntax for string interpolation was introduced in Python 3.6. Since you're using Python 3.5.2, this feature is not available in your current Python version, which is why you're seeing the `SyntaxError`.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you have a couple of options:\n\n1. **Upgrade Python**: Upgrade your Python to version 3.6 or higher. This will allow you to use f-strings for string interpolation. You can do this by using a package manager like `pyenv` or by downloading the latest version from the official Python website.\n\n2. **Use Alternative Formatting Methods**: Since you're currently on Python 3.5.2, you can use either the `str.format()` method or the `%` formatting method for string interpolation.\n\n   Using `str.format()`:\n   ```python\n   my_message = \"I live in {}\".format(state)\n   ```\n\n   Using `%` formatting:\n   ```python\n   my_message = \"I live in %s\" % state\n   ```\n\nBoth of these methods are supported in Python 3.5 and will work without any issues. If upgrading is not an option right now, these alternatives will allow you to achieve similar results."
