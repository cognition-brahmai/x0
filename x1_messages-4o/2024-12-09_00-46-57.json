When I call the built-in function `dir()` in Python's shell, it shows all object names in the current scope. For instance, when I declare a variable such as `x = 10`, it is added to the list of objects. How can I remove these new objects without erasing the initial six objects that were available at the beginning? I am aware of \"memory cleaning\" or \"cleaning of the console\" which erases all text from the command prompt window, but this does not clean out all used objects. Is there a way to achieve this?"

        "content": "In Python, you can use the `del` statement to delete variables, functions, and other objects from the current namespace. However, you should be cautious with this, especially when you want to revert to an initial state with only the default objects available at the start of a Python shell session.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Objects:**\n   When you start a new Python shell session, execute `dir()` to see the list of objects that are present by default. These typically include special names like `'__builtins__'`, `'__doc__'`, `'__name__'`, etc.\n\n2. **Remove Additional Objects:**\n   After you've created additional objects, you can compare the current list of objects with the initial list and delete the additional ones. Here's how you can automate this process:\n\n```python\n# Start by recording the initial state\ninitial_objects = set(dir())\n\n# Create your variables, functions, etc.\nx = 10\ny = 20\ndef my_function():\n    pass\n\n# List current state\ncurrent_objects = set(dir())\n\n# Identify new objects\nnew_objects = current_objects - initial_objects\n\n# Delete the new objects\nfor obj in new_objects:\n    del globals()[obj]\n\n# Verify that only initial objects remain\nprint(dir())\n```\n\nThis script first records the initial state of your namespace, then identifies and removes any additional objects created afterward.\n\n**Note:**\n- The `del` statement only removes the name binding in the current namespace; it does not necessarily free the memory immediately. Python's garbage collector will reclaim the memory when there are no more references to an object.\n- Be careful with deleting objects, especially if they are still in use elsewhere, as this can lead to errors.\n- This method works well in a simple interactive session. However, in more complex scripts or applications, managing state and object lifetimes can require more sophisticated approaches, such as using classes or modules to encapsulate state."
