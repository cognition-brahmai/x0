I want to ensure that when I save, all functions A, B, and C are performed. I've read the super docs and the post about \"Calling the setter of a super class in a mixin\", but I still don't understand how to solve my problem. Here is my existing code:\n\n```python\nclass Parent(models.Model):\n    def save(self):\n        # Do Stuff A\n\nclass Mixin(object):\n    def save(self):\n        # Do Stuff B\n\nclass A(Parent, Mixin):\n    def save(self):\n        super(A, self).save()\n        # Do stuff C\n```\n\nWhat should I write in the mixin to ensure it executes function B and doesn't prevent function A from being executed?"

        "content": "To ensure that both the mixin and parent class methods are executed when overriding a method in a class that inherits from both, you need to properly structure the method calls using Python's `super()` function. This allows you to call the method from the next class in the method resolution order (MRO).\n\nIn your case, you want to make sure that both the `save()` method from the `Mixin` and the `save()` method from the `Parent` class are executed when `A.save()` is called. Here\u2019s how you can modify your code:\n\n1. Use `super()` in the `Mixin` class to ensure it doesn't block other `save()` method calls.\n2. Make sure the `Mixin` class is inherited before the `Parent` class in the class definition of `A`.\n\nHere\u2019s the modified code:\n\n```python\nclass Parent(models.Model):\n    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Do Stuff A\n        print(\"Stuff A\")\n        super(Parent, self).save(*args, **kwargs)  # Call the original save method\n\nclass Mixin(object):\n    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Do Stuff B\n        print(\"Stuff B\")\n        super(Mixin, self).save(*args, **kwargs)  # Ensure it doesn't block further calls\n\nclass A(Mixin, Parent):\n    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super(A, self).save(*args, **kwargs)  # This will call Mixin.save()\n        # Do Stuff C\n        print(\"Stuff C\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Order of Inheritance:** In the class `A`, you should inherit from `Mixin` first and then `Parent`. This ensures that `Mixin.save()` is called before `Parent.save()` due to Python's method resolution order (MRO).\n  \n- **super() Usage in Mixin:** In the `Mixin.save()` method, `super(Mixin, self).save(*args, **kwargs)` is used to ensure that the next `save()` method in the MRO is called, allowing `Parent.save()` to be executed when `A.save()` is invoked.\n\n- **super() Usage in Parent:** In the `Parent.save()` method, `super(Parent, self).save(*args, **kwargs)` is used to call the original `save()` method from `models.Model`, ensuring that any default save behavior is preserved.\n\n- **super() in A:** In the `A` class, `super(A, self).save(*args, **kwargs)` is used to start the chain of `save()` calls as defined by the MRO.\n\nWith this setup, when `A.save()` is called, it will execute `Mixin.save()`, then `Parent.save()`, and finally, any additional logic in `A.save()`."
