However, when I try to use the `update_one()` function as suggested by the Pymongo documentation, it gives me a ValueError stating 'update only works with $ operators'. I'm not sure why this error is occurring as the code works fine when I use the `update()` function. Here is my code:\n\n```python\ndb.collection.update_one({\"_id\":\"key1\"},{\"_id\":\"key1\"},True)\n```\n\nThe error message I get is:\n\n```python\nraise ValueError('update only works with $ operators')\nValueError: update only works with $ operators\n```\n\nWhy is `update_one` not working as expected and why do I need to use a `$` operator?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you are encountering is because the `update_one()` function in PyMongo requires the update document to use MongoDB update operators (such as `$set`, `$inc`, etc.) to specify how the document should be modified. The `update_one()` function expects the second argument to be an update document, which uses these operators to define the changes to be applied.\n\nIn your code, you are providing a replacement document instead of using an update operator, which is why you are seeing the error message about requiring `$` operators.\n\nHere's how you can correct your code:\n\n```python\ndb.collection.update_one(\n    {\"_id\": \"key1\"},  # The filter to find the document\n    {\"$set\": {\"_id\": \"key1\"}},  # The update operation using the $set operator\n    upsert=True  # The upsert option\n)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `{\"$set\": {\"_id\": \"key1\"}}` part is specifying that the `_id` field of the found document (or the new document if upsert is performed) should be set to `\"key1\"`. You can replace the `{\"_id\": \"key1\"}` part in the update document with the actual fields you want to update.\n\nRemember, the `upsert=True` option means that if no document matches the filter, a new document will be inserted using the update document provided with the `$` operators."
