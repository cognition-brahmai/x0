Here's a lightweight function that does that:\n\n```python\ndef flatten_list(two_d_list):\n    return [item for sublist in two_d_list for item in sublist]\n\n# Example usage:\ntwo_d_list = [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], [1, 4, 5, 6, 7]]\nflattened_list = flatten_list(two_d_list)\nprint(flattened_list)\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n\n```\n[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n```\n\nThe list comprehension works by iterating over each sublist in the `two_d_list` and then iterating over each item in those sublists, effectively creating a flat list of all the items."
