I am currently translating a Django application, and I want to include the translation of the homepage of the Django admin site as well. The page lists the application names and the model class names. I am unable to find a way to provide a user-friendly name for a model class. Can anyone guide me on how to achieve this?"

        "content": "To change the model name in the Django admin site and make it more user-friendly or translatable, you can make use of Django's `verbose_name` and `verbose_name_plural` attributes in your model's `Meta` class. These attributes allow you to specify a human-readable name for your model, which will be displayed in the Django admin interface.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Define `verbose_name` and `verbose_name_plural` in the Model's Meta Class:**\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n    # Define your model fields here\n\n    class Meta:\n        verbose_name = \"Friendly Model Name\"\n        verbose_name_plural = \"Friendly Model Names\"\n```\n\n2. **Use Django's Translation Capabilities:**\n\nIf you want these names to be translatable, you can use Django's translation functions. First, ensure that you have `gettext_lazy` imported:\n\n```python\nfrom django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _\n\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n    # Define your model fields here\n\n    class Meta:\n        verbose_name = _(\"Friendly Model Name\")\n        verbose_name_plural = _(\"Friendly Model Names\")\n```\n\n3. **Update Your Translation Files:**\n\nRun the `makemessages` command to extract the strings into your `.po` files:\n\n```bash\npython manage.py makemessages -l <language_code>\n```\n\n4. **Translate the Strings:**\n\nOpen the generated `.po` file for the desired language and add the translations for your verbose names.\n\n5. **Compile the Messages:**\n\nAfter translating the strings in the `.po` file, compile the messages:\n\n```bash\npython manage.py compilemessages\n```\n\n6. **Restart Your Server:**\n\nRestart your Django development server to see the changes reflected in the admin interface.\n\nThis approach will allow you to provide a user-friendly and translatable name for your model classes in the Django admin site."
