        "content": "Based on the customer's intent to find a winter jacket suitable for skiing and snowboarding, a suitable variant of the padded jacket would be one that offers the following features:\n\n1. **Waterproof and Windproof Material**: Look for a padded jacket made with a waterproof and windproof outer layer to keep the customer dry and protected against harsh winter conditions.\n\n2. **Insulation**: The jacket should have excellent insulation, such as down or synthetic fill, to provide warmth without adding excessive bulk.\n\n3. **Breathability**: A breathable fabric will help regulate body temperature and keep the customer comfortable during high-intensity activities like skiing and snowboarding.\n\n4. **Adjustable Features**: Consider a jacket with adjustable cuffs, hems, and a hood to ensure a snug fit and prevent snow from entering.\n\n5. **Snow Skirt**: A built-in snow skirt can help keep snow out during falls or when skiing in deep powder.\n\n6. **Pockets**: Multiple pockets, including an inner pocket for essentials and a ski pass pocket, can be very handy.\n\n7. **Reinforced Areas**: Reinforced areas on high-wear zones like shoulders and elbows can enhance durability.\n\n8. **Ventilation Zippers**: Underarm ventilation zippers can help manage heat buildup during intense activity.\n\nA specific recommendation could be a padded jacket like the \"Columbia Whirlibird IV Interchange Jacket\" or the \"North Face Thermoball Eco Snow Triclimate Jacket,\" which typically offer these features and are designed for winter sports enthusiasts."
