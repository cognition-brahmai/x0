However, I am getting a `NameError: global name 'foobar' is not defined`. Here is the class I have written:\n\n```python\nclass myClass(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    def foo(self, arg1, arg2):\n        pp = foobar(self, arg1, arg2)\n        if pp:\n            return 42\n        else:\n            return -666\n\n\n    def foobar(self, arg1, arg2):\n        if arg1 == arg2:\n            return 42\n        else:\n            return None\n```\n\nI initially thought the `NameError` was due to `foo()` calling `foobar()` before it was defined, but changing the order of function definitions did not help. What could be causing this error and how can I fix it?"

        "content": "The `NameError` you're encountering is due to the fact that when you're trying to call the `foobar` method within the `foo` method, you haven't specified that `foobar` is an instance method of the class. In Python, when you want to call another method within the same class, you need to reference it using `self`.\n\nHere's how you can fix it:\n\n```python\nclass myClass(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    def foo(self, arg1, arg2):\n        pp = self.foobar(arg1, arg2)  # Use self to call the instance method\n        if pp:\n            return 42\n        else:\n            return -666\n\n    def foobar(self, arg1, arg2):\n        if arg1 == arg2:\n            return 42\n        else:\n            return None\n```\n\nIn the corrected code, I've replaced `pp = foobar(self, arg1, arg2)` with `pp = self.foobar(arg1, arg2)`. This way, you're calling `foobar` as an instance method, which is the correct approach. This should resolve the `NameError` you're experiencing."
