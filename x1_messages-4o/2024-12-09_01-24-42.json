I have constructed the following code:\n\n```python\nclass DestinationThread(threading.Thread):\n    def run(self, name, config):\n        print 'In thread'\n\nthread = DestinationThread(args = (destination_name, destination_config))\nthread.start()\n```\n\nBut when I execute it, I receive the following error:\n\n```python\nException in thread Thread-1:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/threading.py\", line 522, in __bootstrap_inner\n    self.run()\nTypeError: run() takes exactly 3 arguments (1 given)\n```\n\nIt appears I am missing something obvious, but I'm not sure what. I'm simply trying to pass a string and a dictionary into the thread. If the Constructor is not the right way to do this, I'm open to creating a new function to set the values before starting the thread. What am I doing wrong, and what suggestions do you have to resolve this issue?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that the `run()` method in a subclass of `threading.Thread` should not take any arguments other than `self`. The `run()` method is expected to have a signature of `run(self)`. When you override the `run()` method and add parameters like `name` and `config`, it causes a mismatch with the `run()` method called internally by the threading module, which expects no arguments.\n\nTo resolve this, you can pass the arguments in a different way, such as using the `__init__` method to accept and store arguments as instance variables. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport threading\n\nclass DestinationThread(threading.Thread):\n    def __init__(self, name, config):\n        super(DestinationThread, self).__init__()\n        self.name = name\n        self.config = config\n\n    def run(self):\n        print(f'In thread with name: {self.name} and config: {self.config}')\n\n# Usage\ndestination_name = \"ExampleName\"\ndestination_config = {\"key\": \"value\"}\n\nthread = DestinationThread(destination_name, destination_config)\nthread.start()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Constructor (`__init__`)**: We override the `__init__` method to accept the additional parameters `name` and `config`. We call the parent class's `__init__` method using `super()` to ensure proper initialization of the thread.\n\n2. **Instance Variables**: We store the arguments (`name` and `config`) as instance variables (`self.name` and `self.config`) within the class.\n\n3. **Run Method**: The `run()` method is overridden without any additional parameters. It uses the instance variables to perform its task.\n\nBy following this pattern, you ensure that your thread is correctly initialized and can safely access the data you pass to it."
