Why does this occur? For example, when I make the following changes:\n\n<pre><code>v = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nvec = v\nvec[5] = 5\nprint(vec)\nprint(v)\n</code></pre>\n\nBoth vec and v display as [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], even though I only explicitly changed vec. Why does v change as well?"

        "content": "When you assign `vec = v`, you're not creating a new list; instead, you're creating a new reference to the same list. Both `vec` and `v` point to the same memory location that holds the list `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`. Therefore, any changes you make to `vec` are also reflected in `v`, and vice versa, because there is only one underlying list.\n\nIf you want to create a new list with the same values as `v`, you should create a copy of `v`. You can do this in several ways:\n\n1. **Using the `list()` function:**\n\n   ```python\n   v = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n   vec = list(v)\n   vec[5] = 5\n   print(vec)  # Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n   print(v)    # Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n   ```\n\n2. **Using slicing:**\n\n   ```python\n   v = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n   vec = v[:]\n   vec[5] = 5\n   print(vec)  # Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n   print(v)    # Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n   ```\n\n3. **Using the `copy` method (available in Python 3.3 and later):**\n\n   ```python\n   v = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n   vec = v.copy()\n   vec[5] = 5\n   print(vec)  # Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n   print(v)    # Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n   ```\n\nBy using any of these methods, you'll create a separate copy of the list, and changes to `vec` will not affect `v`."
