        "content": "To find the most popular product in an online store using SQL, you'll typically need access to a database that tracks sales or order information. Assuming you have a table named `orders` which records each sale, and each row represents an individual order with a column for `product_id` and a column for `quantity` or just a simple count of products sold, you can use a query like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT product_id, COUNT(*) AS total_sales\nFROM orders\nGROUP BY product_id\nORDER BY total_sales DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **SELECT**: We select the `product_id` and use the `COUNT(*)` function to count how many times each product has been sold.\n  \n- **FROM orders**: This specifies the table from which we're retrieving the data.\n\n- **GROUP BY product_id**: This groups the results by `product_id`, so each unique product is considered.\n\n- **ORDER BY total_sales DESC**: This orders the results by the number of sales in descending order, so the most sold product comes first.\n\n- **LIMIT 1**: This limits the results to just one row, effectively giving you the most popular product.\n\nIf you also have a `products` table that stores product names or other detailed information, you can join these tables to get more detailed results:\n\n```sql\nSELECT p.product_name, COUNT(o.product_id) AS total_sales\nFROM orders o\nJOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id\nGROUP BY o.product_id, p.product_name\nORDER BY total_sales DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis query will return the name of the most popular product along with the total number of sales. Make sure to adjust table and column names as they exist in your database."
