        "content": "To create a program that efficiently counts from a smaller number to a larger number, taking into account potential performance issues and handling various data types (like floating-point numbers or negative integers), we can implement a solution in Python. Python's flexibility with data types makes it suitable for handling floating-point numbers and negative integers seamlessly.\n\nHere's a Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef count_numbers(num1, num2):\n    try:\n        # Convert inputs to floats to handle floating-point values\n        start = float(num1)\n        end = float(num2)\n\n        # Swap if numbers are in the wrong order\n        if start > end:\n            start, end = end, start\n\n        # Check for non-integer values\n        if not (start.is_integer() and end.is_integer()):\n            return \"Error: Both numbers must be integers.\"\n\n        # Convert to integers for counting\n        start = int(start)\n        end = int(end)\n\n        # Loop through and print numbers\n        for num in range(start, end + 1):\n            print(num)\n\n    except ValueError:\n        return \"Error: Invalid input. Please enter valid numbers.\"\n\n# Example usage\ncount_numbers(3, 7)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Error Handling:** The program uses a `try-except` block to handle any `ValueError` that may arise from converting the inputs to floats, ensuring that the user is informed of invalid inputs.\n\n2. **Input Conversion:** Both numbers are converted to floats initially to handle cases where the input might be floating-point numbers.\n\n3. **Swap Logic:** The program ensures that counting is done from the smaller number to the larger number by swapping the values if necessary.\n\n4. **Integer Check:** It checks if both numbers are integers using the `is_integer()` method. If either number is not an integer, it returns an error message.\n\n5. **Counting Loop:** If both numbers are valid integers, it uses a `for` loop to count from the smaller to the larger number, inclusive.\n\nThis program should handle a variety of input scenarios gracefully and efficiently."
