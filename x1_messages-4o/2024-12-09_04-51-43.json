The codes could be like 53232, 21032, 40021 etc. I have managed to handle the simpler case of any string of 5 digits using the regular expression [0-9]{5}, but I have encountered a problem where it also matches 6, 7, 8... n digit numbers. How can I modify this regular expression to match only 5 digit numbers?"

        "content": "To ensure that your regular expression matches only 5-digit numbers and not longer sequences of digits, you can use word boundary anchors (`\\b`) in your regular expression. This will help in ensuring that the expression matches exactly 5-digit numbers that are standalone and not part of a longer sequence.\n\nHere's how you can modify your regular expression:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Example HTML content\nhtml_content = \"Some text with numbers like 53232, 21032, 40021, and 123456.\"\n\n# Regular expression to match exactly 5-digit numbers\npattern = r'\\b\\d{5}\\b'\n\n# Find all matches in the HTML content\nmatches = re.findall(pattern, html_content)\n\nprint(matches)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `\\b` is a word boundary anchor. It ensures that the pattern matches only if it's at the start or end of a word boundary. This is useful for ensuring that the 5-digit number is not part of a larger sequence of digits.\n- `\\d{5}` matches exactly 5 digits.\n\nWith this pattern, only standalone 5-digit numbers will be matched, resolving the issue of matching longer numbers."
