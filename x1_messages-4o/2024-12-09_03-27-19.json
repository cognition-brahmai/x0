However, both of these tools only provide function-call level profiling, which is not sufficient for my needs. I need to see how much time each line of code is taking to execute. In other words, I want to see the total time given to each line, rather than the total time for an entire function. Is there a way to achieve this?"

        "content": "To profile Python code at a line-by-line level, you can use the `line_profiler` package, which is specifically designed for this purpose. It provides detailed insights into the execution time of individual lines within a function, helping you identify bottlenecks with greater granularity. Here\u2019s how you can use it:\n\n### Installation\n\nFirst, you need to install the `line_profiler` package. You can do this using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install line_profiler\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n1. **Annotate Your Code:**\n\n   You need to decorate the function you want to profile with `@profile`. This decorator is added by the line profiler when you run your script with the profiler enabled.\n\n   ```python\n   @profile\n   def my_function():\n       # Your code here\n   ```\n\n2. **Run with the Line Profiler:**\n\n   You need to run your script with `kernprof`, a script that comes with `line_profiler`. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n   ```bash\n   kernprof -l -v your_script.py\n   ```\n\n   - `-l` enables line-by-line profiling.\n   - `-v` prints the results to the console.\n\n3. **Analyze the Results:**\n\n   After running your script with `kernprof`, you'll get an output showing the time taken by each line in the annotated function(s). The output will include columns for time per hit, total time, and percentage of time relative to other lines in the function.\n\n### Example\n\nHere is a simple example to illustrate:\n\n```python\n@profile\ndef example_function():\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1000):\n        total += i\n    return total\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    example_function()\n```\n\nYou would run this script using the command:\n\n```bash\nkernprof -l -v example_script.py\n```\n\nThis approach gives you a detailed breakdown of execution time line-by-line, allowing you to optimize specific parts of your code more effectively. It\u2019s important to note that `line_profiler` may introduce some overhead due to the profiling itself, so be mindful of this when interpreting the results."
