The error occurs when I call the fit() function or when I try to scale the data using StandardScaler's fit_transform. It works fine if I reduce the size of the training set. The code I am using is from a book and the details can be found on this [link](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/03_classification.ipynb) at line 60 and 63. My system has ryzen 2400g CPU and 8GB of RAM, with 3.1GB free when using jupyter notebook. My question is, does this error have anything to do with my RAM? And what does \"Unable to allocate 359\" mean? Is it the memory size?"

        "content": "Yes, the MemoryError you are encountering is directly related to your system's RAM capacity. When you see \"Unable to allocate 359. MiB,\" it means the operation you are trying to perform requires an additional 359 megabytes of RAM to store an array with the specified shape and data type, but your system is unable to provide this memory, likely because it's already in use or there isn't enough available.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the situation:\n\n1. **Data Size and Memory Requirements**: The shape (60000, 784) corresponds to a dataset of 60,000 samples, each with 784 features. Using `float64` data type, each entry in the array takes 8 bytes, leading to a memory requirement of approximately 359 MiB for this array alone.\n\n2. **System RAM**: Your system has 8GB of RAM, but not all of it is available for Python as the operating system and other applications consume part of it. With only 3.1GB free, adding a 359 MiB array might exceed the available free memory, leading to the MemoryError.\n\n3. **Solutions**:\n   - **Reduce Dataset Size**: As you've noticed, reducing the training set size helps. Consider working with a smaller subset or using techniques like stratified sampling to maintain class distribution.\n   - **Use a Smaller Data Type**: Convert your data to `float32` instead of `float64`. This will halve the memory requirement per element.\n     ```python\n     X_train = X_train.astype('float32')\n     ```\n   - **Batch Processing**: Implement batch processing for model fitting if the library supports it, which allows you to fit the model using smaller chunks of data sequentially.\n   - **Increase Swap Space**: If feasible, increase your system's swap space to allow more virtual memory usage, though this may slow down processing.\n   - **Optimize Other Applications**: Close other applications or processes to free up more RAM for your task.\n\nBy applying one or more of these strategies, you should be able to mitigate the memory issues and proceed with your model training."
