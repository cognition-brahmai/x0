        "content": "To determine the total number of smaller identical cubes required to construct a larger cube with the same volume as the initial cube, we can break the problem down into a few clear steps. This involves understanding the relationship between the volume of a cube and the number of smaller cubes it contains.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Determine the Volume of the Larger Cube**:\n   - The volume of a cube is calculated using the formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Volume} = \\text{side length}^3\n     \\]\n   - For the larger cube with a side length of 6 cm:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Volume} = 6^3 = 216 \\text{ cm}^3\n     \\]\n\n2. **Understanding the Volume of Smaller Cubes**:\n   - The problem states that the larger cube consists of 216 smaller cubes. Since the volume of the larger cube is 216 cm\u00b3 and it consists of 216 smaller cubes, each smaller cube must have a volume of:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Volume of each smaller cube} = \\frac{216 \\text{ cm}^3}{216} = 1 \\text{ cm}^3\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, each smaller cube measures 1 cm on each side.\n\n3. **Validate the Calculation**:\n   - If each smaller cube has a side length of 1 cm, then the side length of the larger cube (6 cm) can be understood as being made up of 6 smaller cubes in each dimension (length, width, height).\n   - \\((6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216)\\), confirming that 216 smaller cubes make up the larger cube.\n\n### Application in JavaScript:\n\nBelow is a simple JavaScript code snippet that can be used to verify the calculation:\n\n```javascript\nfunction calculateSmallerCubes(largerCubeSide, numberOfSmallerCubes) {\n    // Calculate the volume of the larger cube\n    const largerCubeVolume = Math.pow(largerCubeSide, 3);\n    \n    // Calculate the volume of each smaller cube\n    const smallerCubeVolume = largerCubeVolume / numberOfSmallerCubes;\n    \n    // Calculate the side length of each smaller cube\n    const smallerCubeSide = Math.cbrt(smallerCubeVolume);\n    \n    return {\n        largerCubeVolume: largerCubeVolume,\n        smallerCubeVolume: smallerCubeVolume,\n        smallerCubeSide: smallerCubeSide,\n        totalNumberOfSmallerCubes: numberOfSmallerCubes\n    };\n}\n\nconst result = calculateSmallerCubes(6, 216);\nconsole.log(`Larger Cube Volume: ${result.largerCubeVolume} cm\u00b3`);\nconsole.log(`Smaller Cube Volume: ${result.smallerCubeVolume} cm\u00b3`);\nconsole.log(`Side of Smaller Cube: ${result.smallerCubeSide} cm`);\nconsole.log(`Total Number of Smaller Cubes: ${result.totalNumberOfSmallerCubes}`);\n```\n\n### Explanation of Code:\n\n- **Function Definition**: The function `calculateSmallerCubes` takes two arguments: the side length of the larger cube and the number of smaller cubes.\n- **Volume Calculations**: It calculates the volume of the larger cube and the volume of each smaller cube.\n- **Side Length Calculation**: It calculates the side length of each smaller cube using the cube root of its volume.\n- **Return Values**: The function returns an object with details about the volume of the larger cube, the volume and side length of each smaller cube, and the total number of smaller cubes.\n\n### Final Outcome:\n\nBy performing these calculations, we confirm that the larger cube of side 6 cm is composed of exactly 216 smaller cubes, each with a side length of 1 cm. Thus, the practical application of the JavaScript code verifies this configuration."
