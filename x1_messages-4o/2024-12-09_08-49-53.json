        "content": "Creating a Java program to check if a number is negative or positive is straightforward. You can use an `if-else` statement to compare the number with zero. Here's a simple example:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class NumberCheck {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Create a Scanner object to read input from the user\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        // Prompt the user to enter a number\n        System.out.print(\"Enter a number: \");\n        double number = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        // Check if the number is positive, negative, or zero\n        if (number > 0) {\n            System.out.println(\"The number is positive.\");\n        } else if (number < 0) {\n            System.out.println(\"The number is negative.\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"The number is zero.\");\n        }\n\n        // Close the scanner\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Scanner Class:** We use the `Scanner` class to get user input. It reads the number entered by the user from the console.\n2. **Conditional Statements:** \n   - `if (number > 0)`: Checks if the number is greater than zero, meaning it's positive.\n   - `else if (number < 0)`: Checks if the number is less than zero, meaning it's negative.\n   - `else`: If the number is neither greater nor less than zero, it's zero.\n3. **Output:** The program prints whether the number is positive, negative, or zero based on the condition evaluated.\n\nYou can run this program in any Java IDE or command line to test it with different numbers."
