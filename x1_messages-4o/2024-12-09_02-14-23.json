        "content": "Yes, there is a more elegant and idiomatic way to read lines from a file without including the newline character at the end. You can use the `str.rstrip()` method to remove trailing whitespace characters (including the newline character) from each line. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nwith open(\"myFile.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n    for line in f:\n        line = line.rstrip('\\n')\n        # do something with line\n```\n\nUsing `with open(...)` is also a more Pythonic way to handle file operations as it ensures that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised. The `rstrip('\\n')` method will remove the newline character from the end of the line if it exists, without affecting any other content in the line."
