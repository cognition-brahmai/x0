        "content": "To determine the exact quantity of non-overlapping rectangular prisms needed to construct a house from its architectural design, you can follow a systematic approach. This involves breaking down the design into smaller, manageable parts that can be represented by rectangular prisms. Here's a step-by-step guide, along with a Ruby function to compute the overall volume of the house:\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach\n\n1. **Analyze the Design**: Break down the architectural design of the house into simpler components that can be represented as rectangular prisms. This could include walls, floors, ceilings, roofs, and other structural elements.\n\n2. **Determine Dimensions**: For each component, determine the dimensions (length, width, height) of the rectangular prisms that are required to construct that component.\n\n3. **Optimize Arrangement**: Ensure that the prisms are arranged in a way to minimize overlap and material wastage. This may involve adjusting dimensions slightly or rearranging components.\n\n4. **Calculate Volume**: Calculate the volume of each prism and sum them up to get the total volume of the house.\n\n### Ruby Function for Volume Calculation\n\nHere's a Ruby function that takes an array of rectangular prisms, where each prism is represented by its length, width, and height, and computes the total volume of the house:\n\n```ruby\n# Represents a rectangular prism\nclass RectangularPrism\n  attr_accessor :length, :width, :height\n\n  def initialize(length, width, height)\n    @length = length\n    @width = width\n    @height = height\n  end\n\n  def volume\n    @length * @width * @height\n  end\nend\n\n# Calculates the total volume of the house\ndef total_house_volume(prisms)\n  total_volume = 0\n  prisms.each do |prism|\n    total_volume += prism.volume\n  end\n  total_volume\nend\n\n# Example usage\nprisms = [\n  RectangularPrism.new(10, 20, 30),  # Dimensions of prism 1\n  RectangularPrism.new(15, 25, 10),  # Dimensions of prism 2\n  # Add more prisms as required\n]\n\nputs \"Total volume of the house: #{total_house_volume(prisms)} cubic units\"\n```\n\n### Specific Dimensions\n\nProviding specific dimensions for each prism requires detailed architectural analysis of your house design. Typically, this involves:\n\n- **Walls**: Calculate based on height, thickness, and length.\n- **Floors/Ceilings**: Use house width, length, and a nominal thickness.\n- **Roof**: Defined by slope, width, and length.\n- **Rooms/Sections**: Break down into smaller sections if complex.\n\nEach component's dimensions depend heavily on the specific architectural blueprint of the house. You would typically use architectural software or a detailed plan to extract these dimensions accurately.\n\nBy following this approach, you can efficiently compute the number and dimensions of rectangular prisms needed, and calculate the total volume of the house using the provided Ruby function."
