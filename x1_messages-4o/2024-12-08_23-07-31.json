The depth of this inquiry can be increased by considering the rate of decrease in the difference between each number in the sequence. Additionally, try to express the pattern using only three words. To aid in your solution, consider the concept of exponential growth."

To create a numerical sequence where each number is greater than the previous one and the difference between each number is reduced by a constant factor, you can consider the concept of exponential growth. In this context, the sequence can be expressed as an exponentially increasing sequence.\n\nFor example, consider the sequence generated by the formula:\n\n\\[ a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{n-1} \\]\n\nwhere \\( a_1 \\) is the first term and \\( r \\) is a constant factor greater than 1. The difference between consecutive terms decreases as the sequence progresses.\n\nAn example sequence could be: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...\n\nIn this sequence, the difference between each term and the next is reduced by a constant factor, which stems from the exponential growth pattern.\n\nExpressed in three words: \"Exponential Growth Sequence.\""
