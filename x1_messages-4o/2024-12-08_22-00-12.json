You want to determine if there is a significant difference in the average retirement benefits of employees based on their years of service and job titles. \nWhat type of analysis can you use to achieve this? \nFor example, you want to determine if there is a significant difference in the average retirement benefits between employees who have worked for the company for 10-15 years and those who have worked for 15-20 years with a managerial job title. You can use the following statistical analysis:\n__________________ | Sum of Squares | Degrees of Freedom | Mean Square | F Value | P Value\nYears of Service | XX | 1 | XX | XX | XX\nJob Title | XX | 1 | XX | XX | XX\nInteraction | XX | 1 | XX | XX | XX\nError | XX | XX | XX | XX | XX\nFill in the blank with the appropriate statistical analysis that can help you in determining the significant difference between different years of service and job titles based on their retirement benefits."

        "content": "To determine if there is a significant difference in the average retirement benefits based on years of service and job titles, you can use a Two-Way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance). This statistical method allows you to examine the effect of two independent variables (in this case, years of service and job titles) on a dependent variable (retirement benefits) and also to explore if there is any interaction effect between the two independent variables.\n\nHere's how you can set up the analysis:\n\n__________________ | Sum of Squares | Degrees of Freedom | Mean Square | F Value | P Value\nYears of Service | XX | 1 | XX | XX | XX\nJob Title | XX | 1 | XX | XX | XX\nInteraction | XX | 1 | XX | XX | XX\nError | XX | XX | XX | XX | XX\n\nIn this table:\n- \"Sum of Squares\" represents the variance attributed to the respective source.\n- \"Degrees of Freedom\" (df) is the number of values in the final calculation of a statistic that are free to vary.\n- \"Mean Square\" is the sum of squares divided by its degrees of freedom.\n- \"F Value\" is the test statistic used to determine if the observed variance between groups is greater than within groups.\n- \"P Value\" indicates the probability that the observed results are due to chance. A smaller p-value (typically \u2264 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, suggesting a significant difference.\n\nBy conducting a Two-Way ANOVA, you can test the main effects of each independent variable and their interaction effect on retirement benefits."
