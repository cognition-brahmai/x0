I've tried using the Thrust library, but it is too slow and crashes after being compiled with nvcc debug flags (-g -G). I then tried the cuDPP library, which used to be a part of the CUDA toolkit. Its performance is good, however it is not up-to-date with the latest CUDA 5.5 and there are some global memory violation issues in cudppMultiScan() function while debugging with a memory checker. I'm using CUDA 5.5, nsight 3.1, visual studio 2010, and gtx 260 cc 1.3. Can anyone recommend an alternative to these two libraries that would suit my needs?"

        "content": "Given the constraints and requirements you've mentioned, here are a few suggestions and alternatives you might consider for implementing a high-performance multi-scan or prefix-sum function in CUDA:\n\n1. **Modern CuDPP**: While you've faced issues with cuDPP, it's worth checking if there have been updates or forks of the library that address the compatibility and performance issues with newer CUDA versions. Check the official repository or community forks for any updates.\n\n2. **CUB Library**: NVIDIA's CUB (CUDA UnBound) library is a highly optimized library for CUDA primitives, including prefix-sum operations. It's designed to be fast and efficient, supporting a wide range of CUDA versions. CUB might provide the performance you need and is actively maintained.\n\n3. **Custom Implementation**: If existing libraries do not meet your performance requirements or compatibility needs, consider implementing a custom prefix-sum algorithm. There are several approaches, such as using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses or employing warp-level primitives for better performance. You can optimize specifically for your hardware (GTX 260, compute capability 1.3).\n\n4. **NVIDIA Nsight Compute**: Utilize NVIDIA Nsight Compute to profile and optimize your custom implementation. It can help identify bottlenecks and memory access patterns that need optimization.\n\n5. **Explore Alternative Algorithms**: Depending on your specific use case, exploring other parallel scan algorithms might help. Research papers and community forums might provide insights into cutting-edge techniques that are not yet part of mainstream libraries.\n\n6. **Update Your Toolkit**: If possible, consider updating your CUDA toolkit, Nsight, and Visual Studio to more recent versions. This could provide better support and optimizations for newer libraries.\n\nRemember to test and profile each solution thoroughly to ensure it meets your performance and compatibility expectations."
