The formula for the slope \\(m\\) between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is:\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the coordinates \\((x_1, y_1) = (4, 7)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2) = (6, 11)\\):\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{11 - 7}{6 - 4} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n\\]\n\nNow that we have the slope \\(m = 2\\), we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, which is:\n\n\\[\ny - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\n\\]\n\nUsing the point \\((4, 7)\\) and the slope \\(m = 2\\):\n\n\\[\ny - 7 = 2(x - 4)\n\\]\n\nExpanding this equation:\n\n\\[\ny - 7 = 2x - 8\n\\]\n\nAdding 7 to both sides to solve for \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\ny = 2x - 8 + 7\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = 2x - 1\n\\]\n\nThus, the equation of the line that passes through the points \\((4, 7)\\) and \\((6, 11)\\) is \\(y = 2x - 1\\)."
