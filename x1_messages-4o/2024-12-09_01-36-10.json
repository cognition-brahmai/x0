I have a view where I'm aggregating the 'amount' field from my Payment objects, and I want to display the total paid on my page using a Mako template. However, instead of getting just the total value, I'm getting a dictionary with the key 'amount__sum' and the value being the total amount. How can I modify my code to display just the total amount (like 480.0) instead of the dictionary {'amount__sum': 480.0}?\n\nHere is the code I have in my view:\n```python\nfrom django.db.models import Sum\ntotal_paid = Payment.objects.all.aggregate(Sum('amount'))\n```\nAnd this is the code in my Mako template:\n```html\n<p><strong>Total Paid:</strong> ${total_paid}</p>\n```"

In your view, you should access the value associated with the `'amount__sum'` key and pass it to your template context. Here\u2019s how you can modify your code:\n\n### In your Django view:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db.models import Sum\nfrom django.shortcuts import render\n\ndef your_view(request):\n    total_paid_data = Payment.objects.all().aggregate(Sum('amount'))\n    total_paid = total_paid_data['amount__sum'] or 0  # Handle None case if there are no payments\n    return render(request, 'your_template.mako', {'total_paid': total_paid})\n```\n\n### In your Mako template:\n\n```html\n<p><strong>Total Paid:</strong> $${total_paid}</p>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- In the view, `total_paid_data` is a dictionary with the key `'amount__sum'`. By accessing `total_paid_data['amount__sum']`, you get the value directly.\n- The `or 0` part is a safeguard to handle cases where there might be no payments, which would result in `None` being returned by the aggregation function.\n- Pass `total_paid` to your template context, and then use `${total_paid}` in your Mako template to display the value.\n\nThis way, you'll display only the total amount directly on your page."
