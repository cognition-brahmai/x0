I tried using an if condition but it does not seem to work. Here's my attempt:\n\n```python\nif number >= 10000 and number >= 30000:\n    print (\"you have to pay 5% taxes\")\n```"

        "content": "The issue with your code is that the second condition in your `if` statement is incorrect. You have used `number >= 30000`, which checks if the number is greater than or equal to 30000, rather than less than or equal to 30000. You should instead use `number <= 30000` to check if the number falls within the specified range. Here's the corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nif number >= 10000 and number <= 30000:\n    print(\"you have to pay 5% taxes\")\n```\n\nThis will correctly print \"you have to pay 5% taxes\" if the `number` is between 10000 and 30000, inclusive."
