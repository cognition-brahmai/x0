I am currently able to create a `check` decorator outside of the class, but I want to know how to define it within the class.\n\nFor example, here is how my class looks:\n\n```python\nclass myclass:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.start = False\n        \n    def check(self):\n        return not self.start\n    \n    def doA(self):\n        if self.check():\n            return\n        print('A')\n        \n    def doB(self):\n        if self.check():\n            return\n        print('B')\n```\n\nAnd here is how I have been able to create the `check` decorator outside of the class:\n\n```python\ndef check(func):\n    def checked(self):\n        if not self.start:\n            return\n        func(self)\n    return checked\n\nclass myclass:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.start = False\n        \n    @check\n    def doA(self):\n        print('A')\n        \n    @check\n    def doB(self):\n        print('B')\n        \n\na = myclass()\n\na.doA()\na.doB()\n\na.start = True\n\na.doA()\na.doB()\n```\n\nIs there a way to define the `check` decorator within the class?"

        "content": "Yes, you can define a decorator method within a class in Python. To achieve this, you need to define the decorator as a static method or a class method, so it can be used to decorate instance methods. Here's how you can define the `check` decorator within the `myclass`:\n\n```python\nclass myclass:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.start = False\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def check(func):\n        def checked(self):\n            if not self.start:\n                return\n            func(self)\n        return checked\n\n    @check\n    def doA(self):\n        print('A')\n\n    @check\n    def doB(self):\n        print('B')\n\n\n# Example usage\na = myclass()\n\na.doA()  # Will not print anything because start is False\na.doB()  # Will not print anything because start is False\n\na.start = True\n\na.doA()  # Will print 'A'\na.doB()  # Will print 'B'\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Static Method Decorator**: The `check` decorator is defined as a `staticmethod` using the `@staticmethod` decorator. This allows it to be called on the class itself without requiring an instance. This is suitable for decorators because they are typically independent of instance state.\n\n2. **Decorator Logic**: The `check` method wraps the given function `func` and performs the `self.start` check before executing `func`.\n\n3. **Usage**: The `@check` decorator is applied to the `doA` and `doB` methods to ensure the check logic is executed before the actual method logic.\n\nThis setup allows you to encapsulate the decorator within the class and apply it to the class's methods."
