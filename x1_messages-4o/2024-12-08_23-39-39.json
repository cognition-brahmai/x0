When I want to celebrate, I pop open a bottle of Champagne and pour myself a glass.\n3. My favorite way to relax is by brewing a cup of tea and sipping it slowly.\nCan you identify the word that is spelled differently but pronounced the same in all three scenarios?"

The word that is spelled differently but pronounced the same in all three scenarios is \"bowl\" (sounds like \"boul\"), \"bottle\" (sounds like \"boul\"), and \"brewing\" (sounds like \"boul\"). However, upon closer inspection to match the exact criteria, the word \"glass\" from the first and second scenarios and \"cup\" from the third scenario can be considered phonetically similar in pronunciation."
