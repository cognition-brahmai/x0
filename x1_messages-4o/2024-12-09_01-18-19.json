When I try to install it with \"sudo python setup.py install\", I receive the error message \"'cc' failed with exit status 1\". I have tried the solution \"ARCHFLAGS=-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future sudo python setup.py install\" suggested elsewhere, but without success. Is there a workaround for this issue which appears to have come up with xcode 5.1?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is often related to issues with the C compiler, which is invoked when building Python extensions that require C or C++ code. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Update Xcode and Command Line Tools**:\n   - Make sure that you have the latest version of Xcode and the command line tools installed. You can update Xcode through the App Store.\n   - Install or update the command line tools with the following command:\n     ```bash\n     xcode-select --install\n     ```\n\n2. **Set the Correct Compiler**:\n   - Sometimes, explicitly setting the compiler can help. Try setting the `CC` variable to specify a different compiler:\n     ```bash\n     export CC=gcc\n     sudo python setup.py install\n     ```\n\n3. **Install Required Build Tools**:\n   - Ensure you have all the necessary build tools installed. For macOS, you might need additional packages that can be installed via Homebrew:\n     ```bash\n     brew install gcc\n     brew install make\n     ```\n\n4. **Use Python Virtual Environments**:\n   - Working within a virtual environment can sometimes bypass system issues. Create a virtual environment and try installing the library:\n     ```bash\n     python -m venv myenv\n     source myenv/bin/activate\n     python setup.py install\n     ```\n\n5. **Check for Missing Dependencies**:\n   - Sometimes, the issue occurs due to missing dependencies. Check the `README` or `INSTALL` file of the library for any prerequisites that need to be installed.\n\n6. **Use a Package Manager**:\n   - If the library is available on PyPI, try installing it using `pip`, which can handle dependencies more gracefully:\n     ```bash\n     pip install library-name\n     ```\n\n7. **Examine the Error Logs**:\n   - Look at the detailed error message to identify which specific file or command is causing the issue. This can give you more insight into what might be missing or misconfigured.\n\nIf none of these solutions work, consider checking the library's issue tracker or forums for similar problems, as other users may have encountered and resolved the issue."
