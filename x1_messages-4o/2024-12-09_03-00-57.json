        "content": "The code you've provided seems correct for reading input from the keyboard in Python. However, there might be a few things to consider if it's not behaving as expected:\n\n1. **Press Enter:** After typing the number, make sure to press the Enter key. The `input()` function waits for the Enter key to be pressed to complete the input operation.\n\n2. **Output Buffering:** Sometimes, especially in certain IDEs or environments, output may appear to be delayed due to buffering. Ensure that your environment is properly configured to display output immediately. In the terminal, this usually isn't an issue, but in some IDEs, it might be.\n\n3. **Environment/IDE Issues:** If you're using Eclipse or another IDE, there might be specific settings or configurations that affect how input and output are handled. Try running the script directly in your system's terminal or command prompt to see if it behaves differently.\n\n4. **Python Version:** Ensure that you're running the script with Python 3.x, as `input()` in Python 2.x behaves differently (`input()` in Python 2.x evaluates the input as code, whereas `raw_input()` in Python 2.x behaves like `input()` in Python 3.x).\n\n5. **Check for Errors:** If there are any error messages, they might provide clues about what's going wrong. Double-check your console or terminal for any such messages.\n\nIf the issue persists, try running this minimal example directly in your terminal:\n\n```python\nnb = input('Choose a number: ')\nprint('Number: %s' % nb)\n```\n\nAnd ensure it runs as expected. If it does, the issue might be specific to your IDE environment."
