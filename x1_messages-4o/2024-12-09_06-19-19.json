        "content": "Handling multi-line log records in syslog can be challenging due to the nature of syslog itself, which is designed primarily for single-line log entries. However, you can adopt a few strategies to improve the readability of multi-line logs, especially for exceptions. Here's an approach you can take:\n\n### 1. Adjust Formatter to Include Newlines\n\nYou can adjust the formatter to replace the `#012` newline placeholders with actual newlines, which will make the logs more readable when you view them in a log file that supports multi-line entries:\n\n```python\nimport logging\nfrom logging.handlers import SysLogHandler\nimport traceback\n\nclass MultiLineFormatter(logging.Formatter):\n    def formatException(self, exc_info):\n        # Get the exception and format it with actual newlines\n        result = super().formatException(exc_info)\n        return result.replace('\\n', '\\n\\t')\n\n    def format(self, record):\n        # Use the custom formatException method\n        record.exc_text = self.formatException(record.exc_info) if record.exc_info else None\n        return super().format(record)\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger()\nlogger.setLevel(logging.INFO)\nsyslog = SysLogHandler(address='/dev/log', facility='local0')\n\n# Use the custom formatter\nformatter = MultiLineFormatter('%(name)s: %(levelname)s %(message)s')\nsyslog.setFormatter(formatter)\nlogger.addHandler(syslog)\n\ndef foo():\n    bar()\n\ndef bar():\n    bla()\n\ndef bla():\n    raise Exception(\"EXCEPTION!\")\n\ntry:\n    foo()\nexcept Exception as e:\n    logger.exception(\"EXCEPTION\")\n```\n\n### 2. Use Indentation for Multi-line Messages\n\nBy adding indentation to new lines, you improve readability by visually grouping related lines together. This approach doesn't change the underlying syslog behavior but makes it easier for humans to parse the resulting logs.\n\n### 3. Consider Using a Centralized Logging System\n\nFor more advanced logging needs, consider using a centralized logging system like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or a hosted solution like Loggly or Sumo Logic. These systems can parse and visualize multi-line logs more effectively.\n\n### 4. Log to a File and Send Files to Syslog\n\nYou may also consider logging to a file with full exception stack traces and then using a log shipping tool (like `rsyslog` with `imfile` module) to send logs to a central syslog server.\n\nThese strategies should help you get better multi-line log handling with syslog on your Python application."
