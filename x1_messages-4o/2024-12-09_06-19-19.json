I am also unable to send a bigger vector as it generates a `numba.cuda.cudadrv.driver.CudaAPIError: Call to cuLaunchKernel results in CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE` exception. My GPU is Nvidia Quadro 2000D with 192 CUDA cores and 1Gb RAM. The CPU details are provided as well. The code and results are provided below. Can anyone suggest why this might be happening and how to solve the issue?\n\nHere is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom timeit import default_timer as timer\nfrom numba import vectorize\nimport sys\n\nif len(sys.argv) != 3:\n    exit(\"Usage: \" + sys.argv[0] + \" [cuda|cpu] N(100000-11500000)\")\n\n\n@vectorize([\"float32(float32, float32)\"], target=sys.argv[1])\ndef VectorAdd(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\ndef main():\n    N = int(sys.argv[2])\n    A = np.ones(N, dtype=np.float32)\n    B = np.ones(N, dtype=np.float32)\n\n    start = timer()\n    C = VectorAdd(A, B)\n    elapsed_time = timer() - start\n    print(\"Time: {}\".format(elapsed_time))\n\nmain()\n```\n\nAnd here are the results:\n\n```shell\n$ python speed.py cpu 100000\nTime: 0.0001056949986377731\n$ python speed.py cuda 100000\nTime: 0.11871792199963238\n\n$ python speed.py cpu 11500000\nTime: 0.013704434997634962\n$ python speed.py cuda 11500000\nTime: 0.47120747699955245\n```\n\nAnd here is a more complex operation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom timeit import default_timer as timer\nfrom numba import vectorize\nimport sys\n\nif len(sys.argv) != 3:\n    exit(\"Usage: \" + sys.argv[0] + \" [cuda|cpu] N()\")\n\n\n@vectorize([\"float32(float32, float32)\"], target=sys.argv[1])\ndef VectorAdd(a, b):\n    return a * b\n\ndef main():\n    N = int(sys.argv[2])\n    A = np.zeros((N, N), dtype='f')\n    B = np.zeros((N, N), dtype='f')\n    A[:] = np.random.randn(*A.shape)\n    B[:] = np.random.randn(*B.shape)\n\n    start = timer()\n    C = VectorAdd(A, B)\n    elapsed_time = timer() - start\n    print(\"Time: {}\".format(elapsed_time))\n\nmain()\n```\n\nAnd the results:\n\n```shell\n$ python complex.py cpu 3000\nTime: 0.010573603001830634\n$ python complex.py cuda 3000\nTime: 0.3956961739968392\n$ python complex.py cpu 30\nTime: 9.693001629784703e-06\n$ python complex.py cuda 30\nTime: 0.10848476299725007\n```"

        "content": "There are a few reasons why you might be experiencing slower performance with CUDA compared to the CPU, and why the CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE exception might be occurring. Let's break it down:\n\n### Reasons for Slow Performance with CUDA:\n\n1. **Data Transfer Overhead**: Transferring data between the CPU and GPU can be time-consuming, especially for small datasets. The time taken for data transfer can outweigh the computation time on the GPU for smaller arrays.\n\n2. **GPU Architecture**: The Nvidia Quadro 2000D is an older GPU with only 192 CUDA cores and 1GB of RAM. It might not be well-suited for tasks that require high computational power or large memory usage.\n\n3. **Kernel Launch Overhead**: The overhead of launching a kernel on the GPU can be significant for small operations. This overhead may not be justified for simple operations on small datasets.\n\n4. **Vectorization and Parallelism**: The operations you are performing are element-wise, which are highly parallelizable. However, if the data size is small, the GPU might not be fully utilized.\n\n5. **Warm-up Time**: The first call to a CUDA kernel can be slower due to initialization. Consider running the operation multiple times and taking the average time.\n\n### CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE Exception:\n\n1. **Array Size Limitations**: Your GPU has limited memory (1GB), and trying to allocate large arrays might exceed this memory limit, leading to an invalid value error.\n\n2. **Incorrect Kernel Configuration**: Ensure that the number of threads per block and the number of blocks are configured correctly to handle the array size.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n1. **Profile and Optimize**: Use NVIDIA's profiling tools like `nvprof` or `Nsight` to understand where the bottlenecks are occurring.\n\n2. **Batch Processing**: For larger operations, consider breaking down the data into smaller batches that fit into the GPU memory.\n\n3. **Data Transfer Optimization**: Minimize the frequency of data transfer between CPU and GPU. Use pinned memory if possible.\n\n4. **Kernel Launch Configurations**: Experiment with different configurations for the number of threads per block and the number of blocks.\n\n5. **Operating on Larger Datasets**: GPUs generally outperform CPUs when the data size is large enough to hide the transfer and launch overheads. \n\n6. **Warm-up Runs**: Run a few iterations before timing to allow for any initialization overhead to be handled.\n\n7. **Consider Upgrading Hardware**: If feasible, consider upgrading to a more recent GPU with better computational capabilities and more memory.\n\nBy addressing these factors, you should be able to improve the performance of your CUDA computations and avoid exceptions related to invalid values."
