Investigating external factors or specific events during that period could provide insights into this deviation.\n\n### Market Comparison:\n- **Calculated Average Return:** 4.5%\n- **Market Average Return:** 5%\n\nThe investment's average return of 4.5% is slightly below the market average of 5%. This suggests that while the investment is generally performing well, it may be underperforming compared to similar investments in the market. Investors might consider exploring reasons for this underperformance and potential strategies to align returns closer to or above the market average."
