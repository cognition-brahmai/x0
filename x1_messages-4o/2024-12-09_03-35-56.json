I'm working with a flower classification project using a dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition). Here is the code I've tried so far to load the data (https://pastebin.com/fNLVW1UW) but I'm struggling with it. Specifically, I need help with fixing my code to load the dataset in an 80/10/10 split for training/test/validation and creating the required labels/classes for these images which are already divided by folders in /images."

        "content": "To load custom image-based datasets into PyTorch and prepare them for use in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), you can use PyTorch's `torchvision` module, which provides utilities for loading and transforming images. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you load your flower classification dataset with an 80/10/10 train/val/test split and properly label the images:\n\n### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport torch\nfrom torchvision import datasets, transforms\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader, random_split\n```\n\n### Step 2: Define Transformations\n\nDefine the transformations you want to apply to your images. Typically, you might want to resize them, convert them to tensors, and normalize them:\n\n```python\ntransform = transforms.Compose([\n    transforms.Resize((128, 128)),  # Resize images to 128x128\n    transforms.ToTensor(),  # Convert images to PyTorch tensors\n    transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))  # Normalize with mean and std\n])\n```\n\n### Step 3: Load the Dataset\n\nUse `ImageFolder` from `torchvision.datasets` to load images from directories. The dataset should be structured such that each class has its own directory:\n\n```python\ndata_dir = '/path/to/flowers/images'  # Update with your dataset path\n\ndataset = datasets.ImageFolder(root=data_dir, transform=transform)\n```\n\n### Step 4: Split the Dataset\n\nSplit the dataset into training, validation, and test sets with an 80/10/10 split:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the lengths of each dataset split\ntrain_size = int(0.8 * len(dataset))\nval_size = int(0.1 * len(dataset))\ntest_size = len(dataset) - train_size - val_size\n\n# Perform the split\ntrain_dataset, val_dataset, test_dataset = random_split(dataset, [train_size, val_size, test_size])\n```\n\n### Step 5: Create Data Loaders\n\nCreate data loaders for each split to enable easy iteration during training:\n\n```python\nbatch_size = 32\n\ntrain_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)\nval_loader = DataLoader(val_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=False)\ntest_loader = DataLoader(test_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=False)\n```\n\n### Step 6: Verify Your Data\n\nIt's good practice to verify that the data is being loaded correctly. You can iterate over the data loaders and check the shapes of the images and labels:\n\n```python\n# Example to check a batch from the training loader\ndata_iter = iter(train_loader)\nimages, labels = data_iter.next()\n\nprint(f'Image batch dimensions: {images.size()}')\nprint(f'Label batch dimensions: {labels.size()}')\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n- Ensure that your directory structure is correct with each class having its own folder under `/images`.\n- Verify the path to the dataset is correct.\n- Check the transformations if there are issues with image size or format.\n\nThis setup should help you load and prepare your dataset for training a CNN using PyTorch.
