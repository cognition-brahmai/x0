Here's the code I tried:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nnp.dot(a, b)\n```\n\nand\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nnp.inner(a, b)\n```\n\nEven though the numpy documentation states that the behavior of inner() is different in higher dimensions, I couldn't produce any different output. I've seen that Wikipedia has the same article for both! So, which one should I use?"

        "content": "The confusion between `numpy.dot()` and `numpy.inner()` often arises because they produce the same results for 1-D arrays (vectors), which might be the case in the examples you've tested. However, their behavior differs when dealing with multi-dimensional arrays. Here's a detailed explanation of the differences:\n\n### `numpy.dot()`\n\n- **1-D Arrays (Vectors):** Computes the dot product as expected, which is the sum of the products of the corresponding elements of the vectors.\n- **2-D Arrays (Matrices):** Performs matrix multiplication.\n- **N-D Arrays:** If both inputs are N-dimensional arrays, it performs a sum product over the last axis of the first array and the second-to-last axis of the second array.\n\n### `numpy.inner()`\n\n- **1-D Arrays (Vectors):** Computes the same dot product as `numpy.dot()`.\n- **N-D Arrays:** Computes the sum product over the last axes of the two arrays, unlike `numpy.dot()`, which involves the last axis of the first array and the second-to-last of the second array.\n\n### Key Differences in Higher Dimensions\n\n- **Axes of Operations:**\n  - `dot`: Last axis of `a` with second-to-last axis of `b`.\n  - `inner`: Last axis of `a` with last axis of `b`.\n\nHere is an example to illustrate the difference:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# 2D arrays example\na = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\nb = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\n\n# Using dot\ndot_result = np.dot(a, b)\n# Output: array([[19, 22],\n#                [43, 50]])\n\n# Using inner\ninner_result = np.inner(a, b)\n# Output: array([[17, 23],\n#                [39, 53]])\n```\n\nIn the example above, `np.dot()` performs regular matrix multiplication, while `np.inner()` calculates the inner product along the last dimension of both arrays.\n\n### Which One to Use?\n\n- Use `numpy.dot()` when you want to perform matrix multiplication or when working with 1-D arrays and expecting a dot product.\n- Use `numpy.inner()` when you specifically need the sum product over the last dimension of both arrays, particularly in higher dimensions.\n\nUnderstanding the difference is crucial when working with multi-dimensional arrays, as the choice can significantly affect the result."
