        "content": "For parsing crontab-like schedule definitions in Python and determining the last run time, you can use the `croniter` library. It's a powerful and efficient library specifically designed for handling cron expressions. Here's how you can use it to determine the last run time:\n\n1. **Install the `croniter` library** if you haven't already. You can do this using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install croniter\n   ```\n\n2. **Use `croniter` to parse the cron expression and calculate the last run time**. Here's a sample code snippet:\n\n   ```python\n   from croniter import croniter\n   from datetime import datetime\n\n   # Define your cron expression and the current time\n   cron_expression = '00 3 * * *'\n   current_time = datetime.now()\n\n   # Create a croniter object\n   cron = croniter(cron_expression, current_time)\n\n   # Get the last run time\n   last_run_time = cron.get_prev(datetime)\n\n   print(\"The last run time was:\", last_run_time)\n   ```\n\nIn this example, `croniter` will parse the cron expression `'00 3 * * *'`, which means every day at 3:00 AM, and calculate the last time this would have run based on the current time.\n\nThis approach is compact and efficient, making it suitable for projects where you need to handle cron-like schedules frequently. Adjust the `current_time` to a specific date if you need to calculate the last run time relative to a different point in time."
