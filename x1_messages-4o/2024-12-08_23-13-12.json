        "content": "Extracting the source of a metaphor from a string in Swift involves text processing and natural language understanding, which can be quite complex. However, you can achieve a basic version of this by looking for key phrases that indicate a metaphor. Here's a simple approach using regular expressions to extract the metaphor's source:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nfunc extractMetaphorSource(from text: String) -> String? {\n    // Define a regular expression pattern to match metaphors like \"All the world's a stage\"\n    let pattern = \"All the world'?s a ([\\\\w]+)\"\n    \n    do {\n        let regex = try NSRegularExpression(pattern: pattern, options: .caseInsensitive)\n        let matches = regex.matches(in: text, options: [], range: NSRange(location: 0, length: text.utf16.count))\n        \n        if let match = matches.first, let range = Range(match.range(at: 1), in: text) {\n            return String(text[range])\n        }\n    } catch {\n        print(\"Invalid regex pattern\")\n    }\n    \n    return nil\n}\n\nlet text = \"All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players\"\nif let source = extractMetaphorSource(from: text) {\n    print(\"The source of the metaphor is: \\(source)\")\n} else {\n    print(\"No metaphor found\")\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Pattern**: The regular expression pattern `\"All the world'?s a ([\\\\w]+)\"` is designed to match the phrase \"All the world's a\" followed by a word, capturing that word as the source of the metaphor.\n- **NSRegularExpression**: This class is used to search for the pattern in the given text.\n- **Range**: If a match is found, the code extracts the word captured by the regex group and returns it as the metaphor's source.\n\nThis code will print `The source of the metaphor is: stage` for the provided text. Note that this solution is quite specific and might not work for different metaphor structures without adjustment. For a more general solution, natural language processing (NLP) techniques and libraries would be required."
