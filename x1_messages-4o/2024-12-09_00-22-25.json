        "content": "To convert a `timedelta` to days, hours, and minutes in Python, you can use the attributes of the `timedelta` object. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Example timedelta\nduration = timedelta(days=2, hours=5, minutes=30)\n\n# Extract days, hours, and minutes\ndays = duration.days\ntotal_seconds = duration.seconds\nhours = total_seconds // 3600\nminutes = (total_seconds % 3600) // 60\n\nprint(f\"Days: {days}, Hours: {hours}, Minutes: {minutes}\")\n```\n\nFor your specific use case, where you want to find the time left for a \"listing\", you can calculate it as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Example times\nwhen_added = datetime(2023, 10, 10, 12, 0, 0)\nduration = timedelta(days=3, hours=4, minutes=30)\nnow = datetime.now()\n\n# Calculate time left\ntime_left = when_added + duration - now\n\n# Extract days, hours, and minutes from time_left\ndays_left = time_left.days\ntotal_seconds_left = time_left.seconds\nhours_left = total_seconds_left // 3600\nminutes_left = (total_seconds_left % 3600) // 60\n\nprint(f\"Time left: {days_left} days, {hours_left} hours, {minutes_left} minutes\")\n```\n\nRegarding Daylight Saving Time (DST), the `datetime` module in Python does not automatically adjust for DST when performing arithmetic operations. If your `when_added` and `now` times are timezone-aware and you are using a timezone library like `pytz` or `dateutil`, DST transitions will be handled correctly. Here's an example using `pytz`:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nimport pytz\n\n# Define timezone\ntz = pytz.timezone('America/New_York')\n\n# Example times with timezone\nwhen_added = tz.localize(datetime(2023, 10, 10, 12, 0, 0))\nduration = timedelta(days=3, hours=4, minutes=30)\nnow = datetime.now(tz)\n\n# Calculate time left\ntime_left = when_added + duration - now\n\n# Extract days, hours, and minutes from time_left\ndays_left = time_left.days\ntotal_seconds_left = time_left.seconds\nhours_left = total_seconds_left // 3600\nminutes_left = (total_seconds_left % 3600) // 60\n\nprint(f\"Time left: {days_left} days, {hours_left} hours, {minutes_left} minutes\")\n```\n\nIf you need to manually add or subtract an hour, you can simply adjust your `timedelta` like this:\n\n```python\n# Add an hour\ntime_left += timedelta(hours=1)\n\n# Subtract an hour\ntime_left -= timedelta(hours=1)\n```\n\nThis should help you accurately calculate durations and account for DST if your times are timezone-aware."
