Here's a sample code that demonstrates this process:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Example log entries in JSON format\nlog_entries_json = '''\n[\n    {\n        \"timestamp\": \"2022-01-01 12:00:00\",\n        \"request_type\": \"POST\",\n        \"request_path\": \"/api/example\",\n        \"response_code\": 400,\n        \"response_message\": \"Invalid Request\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"timestamp\": \"2022-01-01 12:10:00\",\n        \"request_type\": \"GET\",\n        \"request_path\": \"/api/another_example\",\n        \"response_code\": 200,\n        \"response_message\": \"OK\"\n    }\n]\n'''\n\n# Load log entries from JSON\nlog_entries = json.loads(log_entries_json)\n\n# Function to classify log entries\ndef classify_log_entries(entries):\n    classifications = []\n    for entry in entries:\n        if 200 <= entry[\"response_code\"] <= 299:\n            classification = \"Success\"\n        else:\n            classification = \"Failure\"\n        classifications.append({\n            \"timestamp\": entry[\"timestamp\"],\n            \"classification\": classification\n        })\n    return classifications\n\n# Classify the log entries\nclassified_entries = classify_log_entries(log_entries)\n\n# Print the classified log entries\nfor entry in classified_entries:\n    print(f\"Timestamp: {entry['timestamp']}, Classification: {entry['classification']}\")\n```\n\nThis script will iterate over each log entry, check if the `response_code` is between 200 and 299, and classify it as \"Success\" if it is, otherwise as \"Failure\". The classification result is then stored in a list, which is printed out at the end. You can modify the `log_entries_json` variable to include more log entries and test the classification logic accordingly."
