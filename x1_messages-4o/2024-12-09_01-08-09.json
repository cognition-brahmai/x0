Here's how my project is structured:\n\n```\nproject\n    /data\n        test.csv\n    /package\n        __init__.py\n        module.py\n    main.py\n```\n\nIn `__init__.py`, I have:\n\n```python\nfrom .module import test\n```\n\nIn `module.py`, I have:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\nwith open(\"..data/test.csv\") as f:\n    test = [line for line in csv.reader(f)]\n```\n\nIn `main.py`, I have:\n\n```python\nimport package\n\nprint(package.test)\n```\n\nWhen I run `main.py`, I get the following error:\n\n```python\nC:\\Users\\Patrick\\Desktop\\project&gt;python main.py\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"main.py\", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\n    import package\n  File \"C:\\Users\\Patrick\\Desktop\\project\\package\\__init__.py\", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\n    from .module import test\n  File \"C:\\Users\\Patrick\\Desktop\\project\\package\\module.py\", line 3, in &lt;module&gt;\n    with open(\"../data/test.csv\") as f:\nFileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '../data/test.csv'\n```\n\nHowever, if I run `module.py` from the `package` directory, I get no errors. So it seems that the relative path used in `open(...)` is only relative to where the originating file is being run from (i.e `__name__ == \"__main__\"`)? I don't want to use absolute paths. What are some ways to deal with this?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is indeed due to the relative path being resolved from the current working directory from where you execute the script, which in your case is from the `project` directory when you run `main.py`. Therefore, the relative path `../data/test.csv` is incorrect because it's looking for a `data` directory one level up from `project`, which doesn't exist.\n\nTo handle this issue without resorting to absolute paths, you can construct the path dynamically using Python's `os` module to ensure it's always relative to the script's location. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Update `module.py` to dynamically construct the correct path:\n\n```python\nimport csv\nimport os\n\n# Get the directory of the current file\nmodule_dir = os.path.dirname(__file__)\n\n# Construct the path to the file relative to the module's directory\nfile_path = os.path.join(module_dir, '../data/test.csv')\n\nwith open(file_path) as f:\n    test = [line for line in csv.reader(f)]\n```\n\nThis approach uses `os.path.dirname(__file__)` to get the directory where `module.py` is located, and then constructs the path to `test.csv` relative to this directory. This way, it doesn't matter from where you execute your script; it will always correctly locate `test.csv`.\n\n2. Ensure that your project directory is your working directory when you run your scripts, which is usually the case when you run `python main.py` from the `project` directory. This ensures that the relative paths you've set up in your scripts are valid.\n\nBy doing this, `test.csv` should be found correctly regardless of the current working directory from which the script is executed."
