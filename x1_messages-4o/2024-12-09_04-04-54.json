Some of the values are missing and are represented by NaN. I am trying to fill these missing values with the mode of the column. I have used the fillna() function with the mode() function as follows: \n\n```python\ndata['Native Country'].fillna(data['Native Country'].mode(), inplace=True)\n```\n\nHowever, when I check for missing values using the following code, \n\n```python\nfor col_name in data.columns: \n    print (\"column:\",col_name,\".Missing:\",sum(data[col_name].isnull()))\n```\n\nIt still shows the same number of NaN values for the 'Native Country' column. I am not sure why the NaN values are not being replaced. How can I correctly use the fillna() function to replace NaN values with the mode of the column?"

        "content": "The issue you are encountering is likely due to the fact that `data['Native Country'].mode()` returns a Series object, and you need to extract the actual mode value from this Series to use it for filling in the missing values. The mode of a column is the most frequently occurring value, and `mode()` returns a Series because there might be more than one mode.\n\nHere's how you can correctly use the `fillna()` function to replace NaN values with the mode of the column:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the mode of the 'Native Country' column\nmode_value = data['Native Country'].mode()[0]\n\n# Use fillna() with the extracted mode value\ndata['Native Country'].fillna(mode_value, inplace=True)\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, `data['Native Country'].mode()[0]` extracts the first mode from the returned Series, which is typically what you want if there's only one mode. If your dataset could have more than one mode and you want to handle it differently, you might need to incorporate additional logic to decide which mode to use.\n\nAfter this change, checking for missing values should show zero NaN values in the 'Native Country' column."
