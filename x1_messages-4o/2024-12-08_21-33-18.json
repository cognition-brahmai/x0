Below is a concise C# code snippet that generates a poem containing at least one metaphor and one simile:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass PoemGenerator\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        string[] lines = new string[]\n        {\n            \"The moon is a lantern in the night,\", // Metaphor\n            \"Guiding lost souls with its gentle light.\",\n            \"As silent as a whisper in the breeze,\", // Simile\n            \"It paints silver dreams on the midnight seas.\"\n        };\n\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Generated Poem:\\n\");\n        foreach (var line in lines)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(line);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code defines a simple poem with four lines, ensuring it includes both a metaphor (\"The moon is a lantern in the night\") and a simile (\"As silent as a whisper in the breeze\"). The poem is printed line by line to the console."
