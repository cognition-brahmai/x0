I'm trying to remove some unnecessary lines from the legend and also disable the hover information on the data points. I have tried using the \"hoverinfo\" parameter but I'm getting an error \"plotly.exceptions.PlotlyDictKeyError: Invalid key, 'hoverinfo', for class, 'Scatter'\". Is there an alternative way to disable hover information for a Scatter plot in plotly?

        "content": "In Plotly, the error you're encountering suggests that the key `hoverinfo` might not be applicable directly in the context you're using, or it might be a version-specific issue. However, there are several approaches you can take to hide the hover information and remove lines from the legend in Plotly:\n\n### Disabling Hover Information\n\nTo disable hover information for a trace in Plotly, you can use the `hoverinfo` attribute set to `'skip'` or `'none'`. However, the error you're getting suggests that the way `hoverinfo` is being applied might be incorrect for your version of Plotly. Try the following:\n\n1. **Ensure you're using `plotly.graph_objs`**:\n   Make sure you are using the correct module for creating a `Scatter` object. The updated syntax for Plotly might look like this:\n\n   ```python\n   from plotly.graph_objs import Scatter, Line, Stream\n\n   badNTULevel = Scatter(\n       x=[],\n       y=[100],\n       mode='lines',\n       line=dict(\n           opacity=0.5,\n           color='rgb(253,172,79)',\n           width=1,\n       ),\n       stream=dict(\n           token=stream_ids[3],\n           maxpoints=80\n       ),\n       hoverinfo='skip',  # Use 'skip' or 'none' to disable hover\n       fill='tonexty',\n       name=\"Water Treatment Plants Can't Process over 100\",\n       showlegend=False  # This will remove it from the legend\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Plotly Version**:\n   Ensure you are using a version of Plotly that supports the `hoverinfo` parameter for Scatter. You can check your Plotly version with:\n\n   ```python\n   import plotly\n   print(plotly.__version__)\n   ```\n\n   If necessary, update Plotly using:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install plotly --upgrade\n   ```\n\n### Removing Traces from the Legend\n\nTo remove traces from appearing in the legend, you can set the `showlegend` attribute to `False`. This attribute controls whether or not a trace appears in the legend:\n\n```python\nbadNTULevel = Scatter(\n    x=[],\n    y=[100],\n    mode='lines',\n    line=dict(\n        opacity=0.5,\n        color='rgb(253,172,79)',\n        width=1,\n    ),\n    stream=dict(\n        token=stream_ids[3],\n        maxpoints=80\n    ),\n    hoverinfo='skip',  # or 'none'\n    fill='tonexty',\n    name=\"Water Treatment Plants Can't Process over 100\",\n    showlegend=False  # This will remove it from the legend\n)\n```\n\nMake sure to use the dictionary syntax (`dict`) instead of the class syntax (`Line`, `Stream`) if you are using a newer version of Plotly. This might also help resolve the `PlotlyDictKeyError` you're facing."
