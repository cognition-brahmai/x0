        "content": "To revert the standard output (stdout) back to its original state in your Python program, you can save the original `sys.stdout` before redirecting it and then restore it when needed. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Save the original `sys.stdout` before redirecting:\n   ```python\n   import sys\n\n   # Save the original stdout\n   original_stdout = sys.stdout\n\n   # Redirect stdout to a file\n   sys.stdout = open('stdout_file', 'w')\n   ```\n\n2. Restore the original `sys.stdout` when needed:\n   ```python\n   # Your code that writes to the file goes here\n\n   # Restore the original stdout\n   sys.stdout.close()  # Close the file to ensure all data is flushed\n   sys.stdout = original_stdout\n   ```\n\nBy saving `sys.stdout` to `original_stdout` before redirecting, you can easily switch back to the default standard output using `sys.stdout = original_stdout`. Don't forget to close the file after you're done with it to ensure all data is written properly."
