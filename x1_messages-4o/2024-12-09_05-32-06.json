Also, I want to handle the situation where I am unable to connect to it. Currently, my code only connects to the server when I use a set() or get() with my Redis instance. However, if the Redis Server is not running, it still prints a Redis object. If other services use my class and the Redis Server is not running, they receive a ConnectionError exception. How can I handle this situation and return a more appropriate message or error code to the user? \n\nHere is a snippet of my code:\n\n```python\nimport redis\nrs = redis.Redis(\"localhost\")\nprint rs\n```\n\nThis is the output even if my Redis Server is not running:\n\n```python\n<redis.client.Redis object at 0x120ba50>\n```\n\nAnd this is the exception that is thrown:\n\n```python\nredis.exceptions.ConnectionError: Error 111 connecting localhost:6379. Connection refused.\n```"

        "content": "To handle the situation where the Redis server might not be running, you can implement a connection check in your service class. This will allow you to catch the `ConnectionError` and return a more user-friendly message or handle it appropriately. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport redis\n\nclass RedisService:\n    def __init__(self, host='localhost', port=6379):\n        self.host = host\n        self.port = port\n        self.client = redis.Redis(host=self.host, port=self.port)\n\n    def check_connection(self):\n        try:\n            # The ping command will test the connection\n            self.client.ping()\n            print(\"Redis server is running.\")\n            return True\n        except redis.exceptions.ConnectionError:\n            print(\"Cannot connect to Redis server. Please ensure it is running.\")\n            return False\n\n    def get(self, key):\n        if self.check_connection():\n            try:\n                return self.client.get(key)\n            except redis.exceptions.RedisError as e:\n                print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Unable to get the value. Redis server is not available.\")\n            return None\n\n    def set(self, key, value):\n        if self.check_connection():\n            try:\n                self.client.set(key, value)\n                print(f\"Key '{key}' set successfully.\")\n            except redis.exceptions.RedisError as e:\n                print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Unable to set the value. Redis server is not available.\")\n\n# Example usage\nredis_service = RedisService()\nredis_service.set('key', 'value')\nvalue = redis_service.get('key')\nprint(f\"Retrieved value: {value}\")\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **`check_connection` Method**: This method attempts to ping the Redis server. If the server is running, it returns `True`. If not, it catches the `ConnectionError` and returns `False`, along with a user-friendly message.\n\n2. **`get` and `set` Methods**: Before attempting to get or set a value, these methods call `check_connection` to ensure that the server is running. They handle any Redis-related errors and provide feedback to the user.\n\nThis approach makes your class more robust by ensuring that connection issues are handled gracefully and that users receive clear messages about the status of the Redis server."
