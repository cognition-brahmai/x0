Here is what I've tried:\n```python\nlast_row = len(DF)\nDF = DF.drop(DF.index[last_row])  # <-- fail!\n```\nI also attempted to use negative indices, but that led to errors. I believe I'm missing something fundamental here."

Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using `drop` method with the correct index:**\n\n```python\nDF = DF.drop(DF.index[-1])\n```\n\nThis uses negative indexing to select the last row. The `-1` index fetches the last element, and `drop` removes it from the DataFrame.\n\n2. **Using slicing:**\n\n```python\nDF = DF.iloc[:-1]\n```\n\nThis will select all rows except the last one. The `iloc` method is used for integer-location based indexing.\n\nBoth methods should effectively remove the last row from your DataFrame. Make sure that `DF` is a valid DataFrame and that it is not empty when you try to remove the last row."
