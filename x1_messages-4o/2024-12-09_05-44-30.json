I am utilizing the following code to accomplish this:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport subprocess\nimport scipy.io\nimport os\n\n#Save data file:\nscipy.io.savemat(data_path + Filename_str, dict(A=board))\n\n#Create / Save figure by using imshow (Heatmap)\np = plt.imshow(mean_map.T, cmap = plt.cm.gist_yarg_r, origin = 'lower',  extent = [0, phi, 0, Z], aspect='auto')\nplt.savefig(figure_path + Filename_str + '-Homophily.pdf')\n\n# Connect to my local host (arabian-knights) using ssh, and follow command.\nret = subprocess.call(['ssh', 'arabian-knights', 'mv Data/* /scratch/Data/'])\nret = subprocess.call(['ssh', 'arabian-knights', 'mv Figure/* /scratch/Figure/'])\n```\nThe simulation runs in the background of the server computer, and even when the connection to the server computer is turned off, the simulation continues to run and the data files are moved to my local computer correctly. However, the figure files (produced by matplotlib.pyplot.imshow) are not saved. Instead, I receive the following error message: \n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"./ThrHomoHeatmap-thrstep.py\", line 179, in &lt;module&gt;\n    p = plt.imshow(board.T, cmap = plt.cm.gist_yarg_r, vmin=0, vmax=n, origin = 'lower',  extent = [0, phi, 0, Z], aspect='auto')\n  File \"/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/matplotlib/pyplot.py\", line 2370, in imshow\n    ax = gca()\n  File \"/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/matplotlib/pyplot.py\", line 701, in gca\n    ax =  gcf().gca(**kwargs)\n  File \"/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/matplotlib/pyplot.py\", line 369, in gcf\n    return figure()\n  File \"/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/matplotlib/pyplot.py\", line 343, in figure\n    **kwargs)\n  File \"/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/matplotlib/backends/backend_tkagg.py\", line 80, in new_figure_manager\n    window = Tk.Tk()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-tk/Tkinter.py\", line 1688, in __init__\n    self.tk = _tkinter.create(screenName, baseName, className, interactive, wantobjects, useTk, sync, use)\n_tkinter.TclError: couldn't connect to display \"localhost:18.0\"\n```\nCould someone help me resolve this issue to allow the Matplotlib figure files to be moved from the server to the local computer as well?"

        "content": "This error occurs because the Matplotlib backend is trying to open a window to display the figure, but it cannot connect to a display server since the script is running on a server without a graphical display environment. You can resolve this issue by switching to a non-interactive backend that does not require a display server to save figures.\n\nHere's how you can modify your script to use a non-interactive backend like `Agg`, which is suitable for scripts running on servers:\n\n1. Set the backend to `Agg` at the beginning of your script, before importing `matplotlib.pyplot`:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib\nmatplotlib.use('Agg')  # Use 'Agg' backend for non-interactive plots\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport subprocess\nimport scipy.io\nimport os\n\n# Define paths\ndata_path = '/path/to/data/'\nfigure_path = '/path/to/figures/'\nFilename_str = 'my_figure_name'\n\n# Save data file\nscipy.io.savemat(data_path + Filename_str, dict(A=board))\n\n# Create / Save figure using imshow (Heatmap)\np = plt.imshow(mean_map.T, cmap=plt.cm.gist_yarg_r, origin='lower', extent=[0, phi, 0, Z], aspect='auto')\nplt.savefig(figure_path + Filename_str + '-Homophily.pdf')\n\n# Connect to my local host (arabian-knights) using ssh, and follow command.\nret = subprocess.call(['ssh', 'arabian-knights', 'mv', data_path + '*', '/scratch/Data/'])\nret = subprocess.call(['ssh', 'arabian-knights', 'mv', figure_path + '*', '/scratch/Figure/'])\n```\n\n2. Ensure that your paths (`data_path` and `figure_path`) are correctly set up to point to where you want to save and transfer your files.\n\nBy using the `Agg` backend, you avoid the need for a display server, as `Agg` is designed for rendering to files without requiring an interactive display. This should resolve the issue with saving your figure files on the server."
