I want the plot created by `plt.subplot(122)` to be half as wide as the plot created by `plt.subplot(121)`. Is there a straightforward way to set the height and width parameters for a subplot in Matplotlib?\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.subplot(121)\nplt.subplot(122)\n```"

        "content": "To adjust the width of the subplots such that the second subplot is half as wide as the first subplot, you'll need to manually adjust the `gridspec` layout. Here's how you can do it using `GridSpec` from Matplotlib:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.gridspec as gridspec\n\n# Create a figure\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\n\n# Create a GridSpec with 1 row and 3 columns\ngs = gridspec.GridSpec(1, 3, width_ratios=[2, 1])\n\n# The first subplot will take up the first two columns\nax1 = plt.subplot(gs[0, 0:2])\nax1.set_title('Wide Plot')\n\n# The second subplot will take up the last column\nax2 = plt.subplot(gs[0, 2])\nax2.set_title('Narrow Plot')\n\n# Display the plots\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this example, `GridSpec` is used to define a grid layout with one row and three columns. The `width_ratios` parameter is set to `[2, 1]`, which means the first subplot will be twice as wide as the second subplot. The first subplot (`ax1`) occupies the first two columns, and the second subplot (`ax2`) occupies the third column. Adjust the `figsize` to better fit your needs."
