        "content": "The Swift code snippet demonstrates resilience in error handling through the following mechanisms:\n\n1. **Error Checking and Logging**: The code checks for an error immediately after attempting to fetch the image. If an error is present, it logs the error message using `print(\"Error fetching image: \\(error.localizedDescription)\")`. This helps in diagnosing issues by providing a clear description of what went wrong.\n\n2. **Conditional Response Handling**: The code verifies that the response is an HTTP response and checks the status code to ensure it's within the success range (200-299). If the status code is not in this range, it logs an error message. This ensures that only valid and successful HTTP responses are processed.\n\n3. **Data Validation**: It checks if the `data` received is non-nil before attempting to process it into an image. If no data is available, it logs an appropriate error message.\n\n4. **Retry Mechanism**: In each error handling scenario, the code calls `self.retryFetch()`, which is presumably a function designed to attempt fetching the image again. This indicates resilience by not giving up immediately upon encountering an error and attempting to recover from transient issues.\n\n5. **Graceful Degradation**: By checking for various potential issues and handling them immediately, the code ensures that the application doesn't crash or hang due to unexpected errors. Instead, it tries to gracefully handle errors and recover from them.\n\nThis combination of error checking, logging, and retrying ensures that the application is robust and can handle network-related issues effectively, thus demonstrating resilience in error handling."
