        "content": "To make comments on the parameters of a function in a way that is recognized by the Pydoc library, you need to use a specific docstring format. Pydoc recognizes and parses standard Python docstrings, which are typically written using triple quotes (`\"\"\"` or `'''`). While Pydoc itself is not as strict about the format as some other documentation tools, following a consistent style like the reStructuredText (reST) or Google style is common practice. Here's an example using the reST style:\n\n```python\ndef my_function(param1, param2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Brief description of the function.\n\n    :param param1: Description of the first parameter.\n    :type param1: Expected data type of param1\n    :param param2: Description of the second parameter.\n    :type param2: Expected data type of param2\n    :return: Description of the return value.\n    :rtype: Expected return type\n    \"\"\"\n    # Function implementation\n    pass\n```\n\nAnd here's an example using the Google style:\n\n```python\ndef my_function(param1, param2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Brief description of the function.\n\n    Args:\n        param1 (type): Description of the first parameter.\n        param2 (type): Description of the second parameter.\n\n    Returns:\n        type: Description of the return value.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Function implementation\n    pass\n```\n\nBoth styles are widely used and understood by Pydoc, and they help in generating clear and informative documentation. Make sure to replace the placeholders with actual descriptions and types relevant to your function."
