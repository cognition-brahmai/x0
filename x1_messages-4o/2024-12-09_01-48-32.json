How can I include the .so file into the Python package? I am considering using Wheel packages as they seem to provide a platform-specific package with all files ready, thus eliminating the need to build anything on the target environments. This package will only be used internally and won't be published to PyPI. Is there a standard way to accomplish this?"

        "content": "To include a shared library (.so file) in your Python package using the `cffi` module and distribute it as a wheel package, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Organize Your Project Structure**:\n   Ensure your project directory is well-organized. Here is a suggested structure:\n   ```\n   your_package/\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 your_module/\n   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 your_module.py\n   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 _your_shared_lib.so  # Place your .so file here\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 setup.py\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n   \u2514\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n2. **Modify `setup.py`**:\n   Your `setup.py` file is crucial for building the package. Here\u2019s an example setup script that includes the shared library in the package:\n\n   ```python\n   from setuptools import setup, find_packages\n   from setuptools.command.build_ext import build_ext as _build_ext\n   import os\n\n   class build_ext(_build_ext):\n       def run(self):\n           # Ensure that the shared library is available\n           if not os.path.exists('your_module/_your_shared_lib.so'):\n               raise RuntimeError(\"Shared library not found.\")\n           super().run()\n\n   setup(\n       name='your_package',\n       version='0.1',\n       packages=find_packages(),\n       package_data={\n           'your_module': ['_your_shared_lib.so'],\n       },\n       cmdclass={'build_ext': build_ext},\n       include_package_data=True,\n       install_requires=[\n           'cffi',\n       ],\n       zip_safe=False,\n   )\n   ```\n\n3. **Use CFFI to Bind the Shared Library**:\n   In your Python module, use the `cffi` package to load the shared library. Here\u2019s an example of how you might do this in `your_module.py`:\n\n   ```python\n   import cffi\n   import os\n\n   ffi = cffi.FFI()\n\n   # Define the interface of your shared library\n   ffi.cdef(\"\"\"\n   int your_function(int);\n   \"\"\")\n\n   # Load the shared library\n   lib_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '_your_shared_lib.so')\n   C = ffi.dlopen(lib_path)\n\n   # Now you can use the function from the shared library\n   def wrapped_function(arg):\n       return C.your_function(arg)\n   ```\n\n4. **Build the Wheel**:\n   Use `setuptools` to build the wheel. From your project root, run:\n   ```bash\n   python setup.py bdist_wheel\n   ```\n   This will create a `.whl` file in the `dist/` directory that includes your shared library.\n\n5. **Install and Test**:\n   Install the wheel in your environment to test it:\n   ```bash\n   pip install dist/your_package-0.1-py3-none-any.whl\n   ```\n   Test the installed package to ensure it works as expected.\n\nBy following these steps, you can create a Python package that includes and utilizes an external .so file using `cffi`. This package can be distributed internally as a wheel, ensuring that all necessary components are included."
