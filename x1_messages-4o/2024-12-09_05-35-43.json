My current solution either prints one character per line, or delays the printing of the entire string at once. Here's the code I have so far:\n\n```python\nimport time\nstring = 'hello world'\nfor char in string:\n    print char\n    time.sleep(.25)\n```"

        "content": "To print each character of the string \"hello world\" on a single line with a delay between each character, you can modify your code to use `sys.stdout.write()` instead of `print`. The `print` function automatically adds a newline character after each call, which is why each character appears on a new line in your current solution. Here's the updated code:\n\n```python\nimport time\nimport sys\n\nstring = 'hello world'\nfor char in string:\n    sys.stdout.write(char)\n    sys.stdout.flush()  # Ensure the character is printed immediately\n    time.sleep(0.25)\n\n# Optionally, add a newline at the end if desired\nsys.stdout.write('\\n')\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- **`sys.stdout.write(char)`**: Writes the character to the standard output without adding a newline.\n- **`sys.stdout.flush()`**: Forces the buffer to flush, ensuring the character is printed immediately.\n- **`time.sleep(0.25)`**: Introduces a delay of 0.25 seconds between each character. Adjust the time as needed for a faster or slower effect.\n\nThis approach will give you the effect of printing each character with a delay on the same line."
