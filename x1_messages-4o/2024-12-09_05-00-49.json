Currently, I have a ModelForm for Topping that lets me choose the pizzas the toppings go on. How can I define a ModelForm for Pizza that also leverages the Many-to-Many relationship and lets me select the toppings for the Pizza?\n\nHere are the models and form I currently have:\n\n```python\nclass Pizza(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n\nclass Topping(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n    ison = models.ManyToManyField(Pizza, blank=True)\n\nclass ToppingForm(forms.ModelForm):\n    class Meta:\n        model = Topping\n```"

        "content": "To create a `ModelForm` for the `Pizza` model that allows you to select toppings, you can use Django's built-in handling for many-to-many fields in forms. In this case, you will want to create a `PizzaForm` that includes a `ModelMultipleChoiceField` for selecting toppings. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom django import forms\nfrom .models import Pizza, Topping\n\nclass PizzaForm(forms.ModelForm):\n    toppings = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(\n        queryset=Topping.objects.all(),\n        widget=forms.CheckboxSelectMultiple,\n        required=False\n    )\n\n    class Meta:\n        model = Pizza\n        fields = ['name', 'toppings']\n\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super(PizzaForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n        if self.instance.pk:\n            self.fields['toppings'].initial = self.instance.topping_set.all()\n\n    def save(self, commit=True):\n        pizza = super(PizzaForm, self).save(commit=False)\n        if commit:\n            pizza.save()\n            self.save_m2m()\n        return pizza\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **ModelMultipleChoiceField**: This field is used to allow multiple selections from a queryset, which in this case is all available toppings. You can customize the widget to be a checkbox list or another type of widget if desired.\n\n2. **Meta Class**: The `fields` attribute specifies that the form will include fields for the `name` and `toppings`.\n\n3. **__init__ Method**: This method is overridden to set the initial selected toppings for an existing `Pizza` instance. This is done by querying the `topping_set` related manager provided by the many-to-many relationship.\n\n4. **save Method**: The `save` method is overridden to ensure that the many-to-many relationship is saved. The `save_m2m` method is called to handle saving the selections made in the form.\n\nWith this setup, when you create or update a `Pizza` using the `PizzaForm`, you'll be able to select which `Topping` instances are associated with it. You can customize the form further based on your specific requirements, such as adding validation, styling, or additional fields."
