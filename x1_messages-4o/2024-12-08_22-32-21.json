If you have \\$10,000 and you invest it in a stock that drops by 50%, how much money do you have left? $\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_$\n2. You have a credit card balance of \\$5,000 with an interest rate of 25% per year.

You invest \\$10,000 in a stock that increases by 20%. If you sell the stock and reinvest the money in a stock that decreases by 20%, how much money do you have left? $\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_$\n6.

        "content": "Here are the solutions to the financial brain teasers:\n\n1. **If you have $10,000 and you invest it in a stock that drops by 50%, how much money do you have left?**\n   - After a 50% drop, you have $5,000 left.\n\n2. **You have a credit card balance of $5,000 with an interest rate of 25% per year. If you make a payment of $100 per month, how long will it take you to pay off the balance?**\n   - This requires solving a complex amortization problem. It would take around 94 months assuming only the interest is compounded monthly, but this is an approximation.\n\n3. **If you have a savings account with an interest rate of 4% per year and you deposit $1,000 each month, how much money will you have after 5 years?**\n   - Using the future value of an annuity formula, you'd have approximately $66,051.50 after 5 years.\n\n4. **You have a car loan with a balance of $15,000 and an interest rate of 10% per year. If you make monthly payments of $300, how long will it take you to pay off the loan?**\n   - It would take approximately 67 months to pay off the loan.\n\n5. **You invest $10,000 in a stock that increases by 20%. If you sell the stock and reinvest the money in a stock that decreases by 20%, how much money do you have left?**\n   - After the first increase, you have $12,000. After the 20% decrease, you have $9,600.\n\n6. **You have a budget of $500 per month for entertainment and you spend $100 per week. How much money do you have left at the end of the month?**\n   - Assuming 4 weeks in a month, you spend $400, leaving you with $100.\n\n7. **You have a credit card with a balance of $2,000 and an interest rate of 15% per year. If you make a payment of $50 per month, how long will it take you to pay off the balance?**\n   - This requires solving an amortization problem. It would take around 56 months to pay off the balance.\n\n8. **If you have a mortgage with a balance of $300,000 and an interest rate of 3% per year, how much will you pay in interest over 30 years?**\n   - Using a mortgage calculator, the total interest paid would be approximately $155,332.\n\n9. **You invest $5,000 in a stock that increases by 10%. If you sell the stock and reinvest the money in a stock that increases by another 10%, how much money do you have now?**\n   - After the first increase, you have $5,500. After the second increase, you have $6,050.\n\n10. **You have a credit card with a balance of $10,000 and an interest rate of 20% per year. If you make a payment of only the minimum amount due each month, how long will it take you to pay off the balance?**\n    - The time it takes depends on the minimum payment policy, but it can take many years, potentially over 20 years, due to the high interest rate and low minimum payments."
