        "content": "The error message you're encountering is due to differences in how strings and bytes are handled between Python 2 and Python 3. In Python 3, you need to explicitly encode strings to bytes before you can work with them in contexts that require byte-like objects.\n\nIn your code, the issue arises from attempting to concatenate strings and then encode them using Base64. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. Ensure that the concatenated string is converted to bytes before encoding it with Base64.\n2. Decode the Base64 encoded bytes back to a string so that it can be used in the headers.\n\nHere's the corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport os\nimport base64\n\n# Concatenate the username and password, and then encode to bytes\nauth_str = f\"{os.environ['INTRINIO_USER']}:{os.environ['INTRINIO_PASSWORD']}\"\nauth_bytes = auth_str.encode('utf-8')  # Convert to bytes\n\n# Encode the byte string with Base64\nauth_b64_bytes = base64.b64encode(auth_bytes)\n\n# Decode the Base64 bytes back to a string\nauth_b64_str = auth_b64_bytes.decode('utf-8')\n\n# Use the Base64 encoded string in the Authorization header\nr = requests.get(auth_url, headers={\"Authorization\": f\"Basic {auth_b64_str}\"})\n```\n\nThis adjustment ensures that the string is properly converted to bytes, encoded using Base64, and then the encoded bytes are decoded back to a string. This should resolve the `TypeError` you're encountering."
