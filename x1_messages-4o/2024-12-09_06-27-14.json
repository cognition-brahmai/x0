        "content": "In Python, tuple comparison is done lexicographically, which means it compares element by element from left to right, just like comparing words in a dictionary. The comparison stops as soon as a difference is found between the corresponding elements.\n\nLet's take a look at the example you provided:\n\n```python\n(4, 5) < (3, 5)\n```\n\nHere's how Python performs this comparison:\n\n1. **First Element Comparison:** Python starts by comparing the first elements of each tuple. In this case, it compares `4` (from the first tuple) with `3` (from the second tuple).\n   \n   - Since `4` is greater than `3`, Python determines that the first tuple `(4, 5)` is not less than the second tuple `(3, 5)`.\n   \n2. **Stop Comparison:** Because the first elements are already sufficient to determine the outcome, Python does not need to compare the second elements (`5` and `5` in this case).\n\nTherefore, the expression `(4, 5) < (3, 5)` evaluates to `False` because `4` is not less than `3`.\n\nIf the first elements were equal, Python would then compare the second elements, and if those were equal as well, it would continue to the next elements, and so on. If all compared elements are equal and one tuple is longer than the other, the shorter tuple is considered smaller."
