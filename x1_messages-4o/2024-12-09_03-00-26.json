        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to the input data types being passed to the model's `fit` function. In TensorFlow 2.x, Keras expects the inputs to be in a specific format, and it seems like it's having trouble with the data types you're providing.\n\nHere's how you can troubleshoot and potentially solve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Input Types:**\n   - Ensure that both your input features (`x`) and labels (`y`) are in the form of numpy arrays. The error suggests there's a mix of numpy arrays and lists. You can convert them using `np.array()`.\n\n2. **Data Preprocessing:**\n   - Convert both your input features and labels to numpy arrays:\n     ```python\n     import numpy as np\n     \n     x = np.array(x)\n     y = np.array(y)\n     ```\n\n3. **Consistent Data Types:**\n   - Make sure all elements within your data are of consistent types. For instance, if your labels are floats, ensure all elements are float types.\n\n4. **Shape Compatibility:**\n   - Check that the shapes of your input data and labels match the expected input shape of your model. Often, RNNs expect input data to be 3-dimensional, typically in the form `(batch_size, timesteps, features)`.\n\n5. **Debugging Shapes:**\n   - Print the shapes of your inputs and labels to verify they are correct:\n     ```python\n     print(\"Input shape:\", x.shape)\n     print(\"Label shape:\", y.shape)\n     ```\n\n6. **Version Compatibility:**\n   - Ensure that your TensorFlow and Keras versions are compatible with the code you are using. Since you are using TensorFlow 2.0.0, make sure the syntax and functions align with this version.\n\n7. **Update TensorFlow:**\n   - If possible, consider updating TensorFlow to a more recent version, as there might be bug fixes or improvements that resolve this issue. You can update TensorFlow using:\n     ```bash\n     pip install --upgrade tensorflow\n     ```\n\nIf the issue persists after checking and applying the above suggestions, you could share more details about how you're preparing your data and model, so I can provide more specific guidance."
