However, when I run `cntlm.exe -c cntlm.ini -I -M http://google.com`, I receive the error `Connection to proxy failed, bailing out`. I also tried using `pip install -\u2013proxy=user:pass@localhost:3128` (the default CNTLM port), but it raises `Cannot fetch index base URL http://pypi.python.org/simple/`. I understand that one can set the `http_proxy` environment variable, but I'm unsure about what credentials to use. Are the ones from `cntlm.ini` correct? How can I check more definitively whether CNTLM is set up correctly, or if there's an alternative way to solve this issue?"

        "content": "When configuring CNTLM and using pip behind a work proxy, there are several steps you need to ensure are correctly set up:\n\n1. **Verify CNTLM Configuration:**\n   - Ensure that the `cntlm.ini` file is correctly configured with the necessary information such as your domain, username, password (or hashed password), and the proxy server details.\n   - Make sure the `Proxy` line in `cntlm.ini` correctly points to your work's proxy server and port.\n\n2. **Testing CNTLM:**\n   - Run CNTLM in verbose mode to check for any errors:\n     ```bash\n     cntlm.exe -c cntlm.ini -v\n     ```\n   - Check the logs for any specific errors that might indicate what's wrong with the connection.\n\n3. **Run CNTLM as a Service:**\n   - Ensure that CNTLM is running as a service and listening on the default port (3128). Sometimes it helps to restart the service.\n\n4. **Configure Environment Variables:**\n   - Set the HTTP and HTTPS proxy environment variables in your system to point to CNTLM:\n     ```bash\n     set http_proxy=http://localhost:3128\n     set https_proxy=http://localhost:3128\n     ```\n   - If CNTLM is correctly configured, you should be able to access the internet through this proxy without including credentials in the `pip` command.\n\n5. **Test the Setup:**\n   - You can use `curl` or `wget` to check if the proxy is working:\n     ```bash\n     curl -x http://localhost:3128 http://google.com\n     ```\n   - If this works, your CNTLM setup is likely correct.\n\n6. **Pip Configuration:**\n   - You can also configure pip to always use the proxy by adding a `pip.ini` file (on Windows) or `.pip/pip.conf` (on Linux/macOS) with the following content:\n     ```ini\n     [global]\n     proxy = http://localhost:3128\n     ```\n\n7. **Alternative Solutions:**\n   - If CNTLM continues to be problematic, consider using another tool like `Proxifier` or checking if your organization provides a different proxy solution.\n   - Directly ask your network administrator if there are specific requirements or restrictions on the proxy that you might not be aware of.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and hopefully resolve the issue you're encountering with CNTLM and pip."
