        "content": "Yes, in Python, it is possible to pass a method as a parameter to another method. However, there are a couple of issues in your code that need to be addressed.\n\n1. **Method Call Syntax**: When calling the method passed as a parameter, you should use parentheses (`()`) instead of `.call()`.\n\n2. **Order of Definitions**: Ensure that the methods are defined within the class before they are used.\n\nHere's a corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n    def method1(self):\n        return 'hello world'\n\n    def method2(self, methodToRun):\n        result = methodToRun()  # Call the method using parentheses\n        return result\n\n    def run(self):\n        print(self.method2(self.method1))  # Passing 'method1' to 'method2'\n\n# Example usage:\nobj = MyClass()\nobj.run()\n```\n\nIn this updated code:\n- The `method1` is passed to `method2` without calling it (i.e., without parentheses).\n- Inside `method2`, `methodToRun()` is used to call the method.\n- The `run` method is added to demonstrate how to use these methods together in an object of the class."
