The algorithm is supposed to decrease the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) with each iteration, but instead, the RSS is increasing and eventually becomes infinite. I am using a CSV file for the data. Can anyone help me figure out what is wrong with my Python code?\n\nHere is the code I have been using:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef gradient_decend(X,Y,W):\n    intercept=W[0][0]\n    slope=W[1][0]\n    gd=[sum(y-(intercept+slope*x) for x,y in zip(X,Y)),\n        sum(((y-(intercept+slope*x))*x) for x,y in zip(X,Y))]\n    return np.array(gd).reshape(2,1)\n\ndef RSS(X,Y,W):\n    return sum((y-(W[0][0]+W[1][0]*x))**2 for x,y in zip(X,Y))\n\ntraining_data=pd.read_csv(\"kc_house_train_data.csv\")\n\nn=0.0001\niteration=1500\nw0=0\nw1=0\n\nW=np.array([w0,w1]).reshape(2,1)\n\nfor i in range(iteration):\n     W=W+((2*n)*(gradient_decend(training_data[\"sqft_living\"],training_data[\"price\"],W)))\n     print RSS(training_data[\"sqft_living\"],training_data[\"price\"],W)\n```\n\nThe CSV file can be found [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.dato.com/files/coursera/course-2/kc_house_train_data.csv.zip)."

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with the increasing Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) likely stems from the implementation of the gradient descent algorithm, particularly the update rule and learning rate. Here are a few things to consider and adjust in your code:\n\n1. **Learning Rate (`n`)**: The learning rate is critical in gradient descent. If it's too large, it can cause the algorithm to overshoot the minimum and diverge, which may be why the RSS is increasing. Try reducing the learning rate significantly (e.g., `1e-7` or `1e-8`) and observe if the RSS decreases.\n\n2. **Gradient Calculation**: There seems to be an issue with how you're calculating the gradient. The summation for the gradient should be divided by the number of data points to get the average gradient. This is because you want to update your weights based on the average gradient across all data points.\n\n3. **Gradient Descent Update Rule**: Ensure the weights update properly. The formula should subtract the gradient (scaled by the learning rate) from the current weights, not add to it.\n\nHere's a revised version of your code with these considerations:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef gradient_descent(X, Y, W):\n    intercept = W[0][0]\n    slope = W[1][0]\n    n = len(X)\n    gd = [\n        -2/n * sum(y - (intercept + slope * x) for x, y in zip(X, Y)),\n        -2/n * sum((y - (intercept + slope * x)) * x for x, y in zip(X, Y))\n    ]\n    return np.array(gd).reshape(2, 1)\n\ndef RSS(X, Y, W):\n    return sum((y - (W[0][0] + W[1][0] * x))**2 for x, y in zip(X, Y))\n\ntraining_data = pd.read_csv(\"kc_house_train_data.csv\")\n\nn = 1e-7  # Adjusted learning rate\niteration = 1500\nw0 = 0\nw1 = 0\n\nW = np.array([w0, w1]).reshape(2, 1)\n\nfor i in range(iteration):\n    W = W - (n * gradient_descent(training_data[\"sqft_living\"], training_data[\"price\"], W))\n    print(RSS(training_data[\"sqft_living\"], training_data[\"price\"], W))\n```\n\n**Additional Tips**:\n- Always start with a small learning rate and gradually increase if necessary.\n- Consider normalizing or standardizing your input features to improve convergence.\n- Monitor the RSS over iterations; it should decrease if the algorithm is working correctly.\n\nThese adjustments should help in getting your gradient descent to converge and the RSS to decrease."
