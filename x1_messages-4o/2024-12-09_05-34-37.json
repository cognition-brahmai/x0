In the class `ServerAdapter`, I encountered a line of code that reads `# pragma: no cover` within the `run` method. I am not able to find any information about the `pragma` syntax in Python documentation. Could you explain what `# pragma: no cover` signifies?"

        "content": "Certainly! The line `# pragma: no cover` is not a Python language feature but rather a directive used by coverage tools, such as the `coverage.py` module. These tools are used to measure code coverage in your tests\u2014essentially checking which parts of your code are executed when running your test suite.\n\nHere's what `# pragma: no cover` does:\n\n- **Purpose**: It tells the coverage tool to ignore the line or block of code that follows this comment when calculating code coverage metrics.\n- **Usage**: It's often used in situations where certain code paths are not meant to be tested or are difficult to test. For example, platform-specific code, code that handles specific exceptions, or code that will never run in a test environment.\n\nIn the context of the `ServerAdapter` class in Bottle, the `run` method might contain platform-specific server starting code or other environment-specific logic that isn't easily testable or necessary to test, hence the use of `# pragma: no cover`.\n\nThis allows developers to maintain high coverage percentages while acknowledging that some parts of the code are intentionally excluded from testing metrics."
