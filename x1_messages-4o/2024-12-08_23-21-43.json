Hint: Think about the benefits of giving your mind a rest."

If it takes you 45 minutes to complete a task without any breaks, introducing a 15-minute break halfway through can have a positive impact on your productivity and focus. By taking a break, you allow your mind to rest and recharge, potentially making the second half of your task more efficient.\n\nHowever, in terms of pure time calculation, completing the task with a break would take the original 45 minutes plus the 15-minute break, totaling 60 minutes. The potential benefit is an increase in the quality of work or a reduction in mental fatigue, which might not change the overall time but could improve performance and efficiency."
