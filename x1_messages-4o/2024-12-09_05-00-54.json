The script works fine on my other laptop, but on this one, it fails and I receive only one error code: \"Process finished with exit code -1073741515 (0xC0000135)\". No other results or output is generated, not even from \"print\" commands at the start of the file. I've tried reinstalling Python (2.7.9), pygame (1.9.1), and PyCharm (both versions 4.5 and 5.0), but to no avail. Can anyone help me understand what this error code means as I couldn't find any information on it?"

        "content": "The error code `-1073741515 (0xC0000135)` usually indicates a missing DLL dependency on Windows systems. This error often occurs when a required dynamic-link library (DLL) is not found or cannot be accessed by the program. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check for Missing DLLs**: \n   - Use a tool like Dependency Walker to check which DLLs your Python script might be missing. This tool can help identify any missing or problematic DLLs that the script depends on.\n\n2. **Environment Variables**:\n   - Ensure that your PATH environment variable includes the path to your Python installation and any other necessary libraries. Sometimes, the system cannot locate the required DLLs because the paths are not properly set.\n\n3. **Visual C++ Redistributable**:\n   - Make sure that you have the correct version of the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable installed, as Python extensions and certain libraries can depend on it. The version you need corresponds to the version of Python you're using. For Python 2.7, you may need the Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable.\n\n4. **Reinstall Libraries**:\n   - Double-check that you have installed all necessary libraries and extensions for your script. Reinstall them if needed, ensuring that they are compatible with your Python version.\n\n5. **Check Python Installation**:\n   - Verify that your Python installation is complete and not corrupted. You can try reinstalling Python and ensuring that all components are correctly installed.\n\n6. **Compare Environments**:\n   - Compare the environment of your working laptop with the one where it fails. Look for differences in installed software, environment variables, and system configurations.\n\n7. **Run with Administrator Privileges**:\n   - Try running your script with administrator privileges to rule out permission issues.\n\nIf you continue to encounter difficulties, providing more details about your script and system configuration can also help in diagnosing the issue further."
