        "content": "To determine if the given user query \"Whenever I go to the park\" is an independent or dependent clause, and to check for subordinating conjunctions, we can analyze its structure:\n\n1. **Clause Type**:\n   - **Dependent Clause**: This is a dependent clause because it does not express a complete thought. It leaves the reader wondering what happens when you go to the park.\n\n2. **Subordinating Conjunction**:\n   - The word \"Whenever\" is a subordinating conjunction. It introduces the dependent clause and shows the relationship between the dependent clause and the independent clause it might be connected to.\n\nNow, let's provide a code snippet to identify subordinate clauses. We'll use Python with a library like `nltk` (Natural Language Toolkit) to perform this task:\n\n```python\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\n\n# Ensure you have the necessary resources\nnltk.download('punkt')\nnltk.download('stopwords')\n\n# List of common subordinating conjunctions\nsubordinating_conjunctions = [\n    'after', 'although', 'as', 'because', 'before', 'even if', 'even though',\n    'if', 'in order that', 'once', 'provided that', 'rather than', 'since',\n    'so that', 'than', 'that', 'though', 'unless', 'until', 'when', 'whenever',\n    'where', 'whereas', 'wherever', 'whether', 'while', 'why'\n]\n\ndef identify_subordinate_clause(sentence):\n    words = word_tokenize(sentence.lower())\n    for word in words:\n        if word in subordinating_conjunctions:\n            return True, word\n    return False, None\n\n# Example usage\nsentence = \"Whenever I go to the park\"\nis_subordinate, conjunction = identify_subordinate_clause(sentence)\nif is_subordinate:\n    print(f\"The sentence is a subordinate clause with the conjunction '{conjunction}'.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The sentence is not a subordinate clause.\")\n\n```\n\nThis code snippet checks if a given sentence is a subordinate clause by searching for subordinating conjunctions within it. If it finds any, it classifies the sentence as a subordinate clause."
