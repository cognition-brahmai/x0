Using the formula Population Density = Population divided by Land Area, what is the population density of the city in terms of persons per square kilometer? You can find the relevant information in the following code snippet:\n```\ncity_data = {\n  \"population\": 75000,\n  \"land_area\": 150\n}\n```\nHint: Remember to divide the population by the land area to get the population density in units of persons per square kilometer."
