        "content": "To print the sentence \"Hello World!\" in a fancy manner using Ruby, you can utilize string interpolation and escape sequences for basic formatting. For more advanced text styling, such as changing the font style, color, and background, you can use Ruby libraries like `colorize` and `rainbow`. Below, I'll provide a demonstration of both basic and advanced text formatting techniques in Ruby.\n\n### Basic Formatting with Interpolation and Escape Characters\n\n```ruby\n# Using interpolation and escape characters\nname = \"World\"\nputs \"Hello, #{name}!\\nWelcome to the Ruby world!\"\n```\n\n### Advanced Formatting Using Libraries\n\n#### Using the `colorize` Gem\n\nTo use the `colorize` gem, you first need to install it. You can do this by running:\n\n```bash\ngem install colorize\n```\n\nHere's how you can use the `colorize` gem to style your text:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'colorize'\n\n# Change text color, background color, and add text effects\nputs \"Hello World!\".colorize(:color => :light_blue, :background => :black, :mode => :bold)\n```\n\n#### Using the `rainbow` Gem\n\nThe `rainbow` gem is another option for coloring text. Install it using:\n\n```bash\ngem install rainbow\n```\n\nHere's an example using the `rainbow` gem:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'rainbow'\n\n# Style the text with color\nputs Rainbow(\"Hello World!\").red.bg(:yellow).underline.bright\n```\n\n### Combining Techniques\n\nYou can combine these techniques to create more complex outputs. For example:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'colorize'\nrequire 'rainbow'\n\nmessage = \"Hello World!\"\n\n# Using colorize\nfancy_message = message.colorize(:color => :cyan, :background => :black, :mode => :bold)\n\n# Using rainbow\nfancy_message_rainbow = Rainbow(fancy_message).underline.bright\n\nputs fancy_message_rainbow\n```\n\n### Summary\n\n- **String Interpolation and Escape Characters**: Useful for basic formatting like inserting variables and breaking lines.\n- **Colorize Gem**: Offers a simple way to apply colors and styles to text.\n- **Rainbow Gem**: Provides additional styling options like underlining and brightness.\n\nThese libraries offer a variety of options to customize your text output in Ruby, allowing you to create visually appealing console applications."
