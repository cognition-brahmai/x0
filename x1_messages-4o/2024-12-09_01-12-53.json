I have created a TimeSeries as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndates = [datetime(2011, 1, 2), datetime(2011, 1, 5), datetime(2011, 1, 7),\ndatetime(2011, 1, 8), datetime(2011, 1, 10), datetime(2011, 1, 12)]\n\nts = Series(np.random.randn(6), index=dates)\n```\n\nWhen I print `ts`, it displays:\n\n```python\n2011-01-02 0.690002\n2011-01-05 1.001543\n2011-01-07 -0.503087\n2011-01-08 -0.622274\n2011-01-10 -0.921169\n2011-01-12 -0.726213\n```\n\nHowever, when I check the index type of `ts`, it returns `dtype('datetime64[ns]')`. But when I do the same operation in the console, it returns `dtype('<M8[ns]')`. What is causing the difference?"

        "content": "The difference you're observing between `datetime64[ns]` and `<M8[ns]` in pandas is essentially a matter of representation rather than a fundamental difference in the data type itself.\n\n1. **`datetime64[ns]`**:\n   - This is a more human-readable string representation used by pandas to indicate the `datetime64` data type with nanosecond precision. Pandas uses this representation for clarity and to make it easier for users to understand what type of data is being dealt with.\n\n2. **`<M8[ns]`**:\n   - This is the NumPy internal representation for the same data type. `<M8` stands for \"time\" (or datetime), and `[ns]` indicates that the precision is in nanoseconds. The angle brackets are part of NumPy's dtype machinery, indicating the byte order and type kind.\n\nThe discrepancy you're seeing between the two outputs is likely due to the context in which the data type is being printed:\n\n- When you check the index type in the pandas Series, pandas uses its own more descriptive type string (`datetime64[ns]`).\n- When you're interacting directly with NumPy or possibly some lower-level operations, you might see the NumPy dtype representation (`<M8[ns]`).\n\nBoth essentially refer to the same data type: a datetime with nanosecond precision. It's just that pandas provides a more user-friendly string for displaying the dtype."
