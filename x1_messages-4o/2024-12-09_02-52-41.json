Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Set the Default Interpreter**: Make sure your project is configured to use the desired Python interpreter. Go to `File > Settings` (or `PyCharm > Preferences` on macOS) and navigate to `Project: [Your Project Name] > Python Interpreter`. Select the interpreter you want to use.\n\n2. **Use the Default Run/Debug Configuration**: PyCharm has a feature that allows you to run the current script without explicitly setting up a run configuration. This uses the project\u2019s default Python interpreter.\n\n3. **Run the Current File**: You can run the currently opened file using the default interpreter by using a hotkey. The default hotkey for running a script in PyCharm is `Shift + F10`. This will execute the script that is currently in focus in the editor.\n\n4. **Modify Hotkeys if Necessary**: If `Shift + F10` does not suit your needs or if you have changed your keymap, you can customize the hotkey by going to `File > Settings` (or `PyCharm > Preferences` on macOS), then `Keymap`. In the search bar, type \"Run\" to find and modify the shortcut for \"Run\".\n\nBy following these steps, you can efficiently execute the currently opened Python file using the default interpreter without needing to create a separate run configuration each time."
