However, there is a twist - the chest is guarded by a series of booby traps that can only be disarmed by solving a series of puzzles.\nOne of the puzzles requires you to use the treasure to pay off a group of 5 guards who are blocking your path. Each guard has a different fee for allowing you to pass, and you must pay them in a particular order. The fees are as follows:\n- Guard 1: 10 gold coins\n- Guard 2: 5 gold coins\n- Guard 3: 15 gold coins\n- Guard 4: 2 gold coins\n- Guard 5: 20 gold coins\nHowever, there is a catch - you only have a limited amount of gold coins in your treasure chest, and you must use the minimum amount possible to pay off all the guards. Additionally, you can only pay one guard at a time, and you cannot leave any guards unpaid as they will sound the alarm and alert the other guards.\nWhat is the minimum amount of gold coins you must pay in order to successfully pass all 5 guards and continue on your journey to claim the rest of the treasure?"

The minimum amount of gold coins required to pay off all the guards is the sum of all their fees:\n\n- Guard 1: 10 gold coins\n- Guard 2: 5 gold coins\n- Guard 3: 15 gold coins\n- Guard 4: 2 gold coins\n- Guard 5: 20 gold coins\n\nTotal = 10 + 5 + 15 + 2 + 20 = 52 gold coins\n\nTherefore, the minimum amount of gold coins you must pay to successfully pass all 5 guards is 52 gold coins."
