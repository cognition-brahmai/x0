        "content": "To determine the current Git branch in a Unix-like environment, you can use several methods. Here are a few ways to achieve this programmatically within a script:\n\n1. **Using Git Commands:**\n   You can use `git rev-parse` or `git symbolic-ref` to get the current branch name.\n\n   ```bash\n   # Using git symbolic-ref\n   current_branch=$(git symbolic-ref --short HEAD)\n   echo $current_branch\n\n   # Alternatively, using git rev-parse\n   current_branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)\n   echo $current_branch\n   ```\n\n   Both of these commands will give you the name of the currently checked-out branch.\n\n2. **Reading from the `.git` Directory:**\n   You can directly read the HEAD file in the `.git` directory, although this is less portable and not recommended for scripts intended to be robust across different Git versions.\n\n   ```bash\n   # Directly reading the HEAD file\n   current_branch=$(cat .git/HEAD | sed 's|ref: refs/heads/||')\n   echo $current_branch\n   ```\n\n   This approach works because the `HEAD` file contains the line `ref: refs/heads/branch_name` when you are on a branch.\n\n3. **Using `git branch`:**\n   You can parse the output of `git branch` to find the currently checked-out branch.\n\n   ```bash\n   # Using git branch and grep\n   current_branch=$(git branch --show-current)\n   echo $current_branch\n   ```\n\n   This command will directly show the current branch without the need for additional parsing.\n\nThese methods will help you programmatically determine the current branch in a Git repository from within a script, allowing you to automate tasks like labeling a release. Make sure that the script is executed within a Git repository to avoid errors."
