        "content": "Designing a role-playing scenario for a job interview that simulates a cross-functional team working on a project with strict deadlines can be an engaging way to assess a candidate's problem-solving, communication, and leadership skills. Here's how you might structure such a scenario:\n\n### Scenario Design:\n\n**Objective:**  \nTo assess the candidate's ability to manage a cross-functional team and adapt to unexpected challenges while meeting project deadlines.\n\n**Setup:**\n1. **Team Composition:** Simulate a team consisting of members from different departments (e.g., Development, Design, Marketing, QA).\n2. **Project:** Develop a new feature for a mobile application with a strict deadline of two weeks.\n3. **Roles:** Assign the candidate the role of Project Manager.\n\n**Surprise Twist:**\n- Midway through the project, the lead developer unexpectedly quits. The candidate must reallocate resources and adjust the project plan to meet the original deadline.\n\n### Implementation in Ruby:\n\nHere's a Ruby code snippet that simulates this scenario:\n\n```ruby\nclass TeamMember\n  attr_accessor :name, :role, :available\n\n  def initialize(name, role)\n    @name = name\n    @role = role\n    @available = true\n  end\n\n  def quit\n    @available = false\n    puts \"#{name} has unexpectedly quit the project!\"\n  end\nend\n\nclass Project\n  attr_accessor :deadline, :team, :tasks\n\n  def initialize(deadline)\n    @deadline = deadline\n    @team = []\n    @tasks = {}\n  end\n\n  def add_team_member(member)\n    @team << member\n  end\n\n  def assign_task(task, role)\n    @tasks[task] = role\n  end\n\n  def simulate_twist\n    quitting_member = @team.find { |member| member.role == 'Developer' }\n    quitting_member.quit if quitting_member\n  end\n\n  def reallocate_resources\n    puts \"Reallocating resources to meet the deadline...\"\n    available_members = @team.select(&:available)\n    available_members.each do |member|\n      puts \"Assigning tasks to #{member.name} (#{member.role})\"\n    end\n  end\n\n  def manage_project\n    puts \"Managing project with deadline: #{@deadline}\"\n    simulate_twist\n    reallocate_resources\n    puts \"Project plan adjusted successfully to meet the deadline.\"\n  end\nend\n\n# Create a project with a strict deadline\nproject = Project.new(\"2 weeks\")\n\n# Add team members\nproject.add_team_member(TeamMember.new(\"Alice\", \"Developer\"))\nproject.add_team_member(TeamMember.new(\"Bob\", \"Designer\"))\nproject.add_team_member(TeamMember.new(\"Charlie\", \"Marketing\"))\nproject.add_team_member(TeamMember.new(\"Dana\", \"QA\"))\n\n# Assign tasks based on roles\nproject.assign_task(\"Develop new feature\", \"Developer\")\nproject.assign_task(\"Design UI\", \"Designer\")\nproject.assign_task(\"Create marketing plan\", \"Marketing\")\nproject.assign_task(\"Test new feature\", \"QA\")\n\n# Simulate the project management scenario\nproject.manage_project\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **TeamMember Class:** Represents each team member, with attributes for name, role, and availability.\n- **Project Class:** Manages the project, including team members, tasks, and the project deadline.\n- **simulate_twist Method:** Simulates the unexpected departure of a key team member.\n- **reallocate_resources Method:** Redistributes tasks among remaining team members to ensure the project stays on track.\n- **manage_project Method:** Coordinates the entire scenario, handling the unexpected twist and ensuring the project meets its deadline.\n\nThis simulation provides a framework for a role-playing interview scenario, allowing the candidate to demonstrate their ability to adapt and manage a team effectively."
