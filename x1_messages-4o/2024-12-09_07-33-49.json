        "content": "In Python, is it possible to customize the Black formatter? I appreciate the majority of its features, but one aspect I'd like to change is its formatting for functions with multiple arguments. Currently, it formats them as follows:\n\n```python\ndef example_function(arg_1: str, arg_2: bool, arg_3: int = 0, arg_4: int = 1, arg_5: float = 0.0):\n    pass\n```\n\nHowever, I would prefer the arguments to be displayed each on a new line for better readability, as follows:\n\n```python\ndef example_function(\n    arg_1: str, \n    arg_2: bool, \n    arg_3: int = 0, \n    arg_4: int = 1, \n    arg_5: float = 0.0\n):\n```\n\nIs this achievable with Black or another formatter? This issue occurs frequently and is making me consider not using Black at all. Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated."

        "content": "Black is designed to enforce a consistent code style, and by default, it doesn't offer much in terms of customization. This is intentional, as its primary goal is to provide an opinionated formatter that reduces time spent on formatting debates. However, there are a few strategies you could try to achieve your desired formatting:\n\n1. **Force Line Breaks:**\n   While Black doesn't allow direct customization for how function arguments are formatted, you can force Black to format the arguments on separate lines by exceeding the line length limit. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   def example_function(\n       arg_1: str,\n       arg_2: bool,\n       arg_3: int = 0,\n       arg_4: int = 1,\n       arg_5: float = 0.0\n   ):\n       pass\n   ```\n\n   By placing the opening parenthesis on a new line, Black will keep each argument on a separate line.\n\n2. **Use Configuration Options:**\n   Although Black is not highly configurable, you can adjust the line length by using the `--line-length` option if that helps you control where the line breaks occur. For example, running Black with `black --line-length 80 your_script.py` might sometimes help achieve your desired layout if the default line length (88 characters) is too long.\n\n3. **Alternative Formatters:**\n   If the lack of configurability in Black is a deal-breaker for you, consider using a different formatter that offers more flexibility, such as:\n   - **YAPF**: It offers greater configurability. You can create a `.style.yapf` configuration file to adjust its behavior to suit your needs.\n   - **autopep8**: While not as configurable as YAPF, it offers some options for customizing the formatting.\n\n4. **Post-Processing Script:**\n   You could write a small script to post-process the Black-formatted code to adjust the function argument layout to match your preference. This would involve parsing the code and adjusting the formatting, which can be complex but is doable with Python's `ast` module or other parsing libraries.\n\nUltimately, if the specific function formatting style is a crucial requirement, using a formatter that allows for more granular configuration might be the best approach."
