Here are five interview questions you might consider asking a team leader to gain insights into their leadership style, experience, and approach:\n\n1. **Can you describe a challenging project you've led and how you managed your team to overcome obstacles and achieve success?**\n\n2. **How do you handle conflicts or disagreements within your team, and can you provide an example of a conflict you've resolved?**\n\n3. **What strategies do you use to motivate and inspire your team to achieve their goals and maintain high performance levels?**\n\n4. **How do you balance the needs of your team with the expectations of upper management, and how do you communicate effectively between the two?**\n\n5. **Can you share an example of a time when you had to adapt your leadership style to suit the needs of different team members or a specific situation?**\n\nThese questions aim to explore the candidate's problem-solving abilities, communication skills, adaptability, and overall leadership approach."
