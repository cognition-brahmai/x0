I am following a book called \"Learning Django Web Development\" by Sanjeev Jaiswal and Ratan Kumar, which is based on an earlier version of Django. The book instructs to use the 'syncdb' command to populate the database with tables, like this: \n\n```python\n$ python manage.py syncdb\n```\n\nThe book mentions that the terminal will prompt you to create a superuser account after running the above command. However, in Django 1.9.6, the 'syncdb' command is no longer in use. I found that the 'migrate' command can populate the database with tables, but it doesn't prompt the creation of a superuser account. How can I create a superuser account in this version of Django?"

        "content": "In Django 1.9.6, the `syncdb` command was indeed removed and replaced by the `migrate` command, which handles both creating tables and applying migrations. To create a superuser account in Django 1.9.6, you can use the `createsuperuser` management command. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Run Migrations**: First, ensure that you have migrated your database to create the necessary tables.\n\n   ```bash\n   $ python manage.py migrate\n   ```\n\n2. **Create Superuser**: Use the `createsuperuser` command to create a superuser account.\n\n   ```bash\n   $ python manage.py createsuperuser\n   ```\n\n3. **Follow the Prompts**: You will be prompted to enter a username, email address, and password for your superuser account. Fill in the details as required.\n\nHere is a step-by-step example:\n\n```bash\n$ python manage.py migrate\n$ python manage.py createsuperuser\n```\n\nYou will see prompts similar to the following:\n\n```\nUsername (leave blank to use 'your-username'): admin\nEmail address: admin@example.com\nPassword: \nPassword (again): \nSuperuser created successfully.\n```\n\nOnce you've completed those steps, you should have a superuser account created, and you can log into the Django admin interface using the credentials you\u2019ve specified."
