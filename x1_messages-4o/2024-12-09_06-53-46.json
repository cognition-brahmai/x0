What I need to do is to start from a specific position in my array and then subsample every nth data point from that position until the end of my array. For instance, if I have an array like this:\n\n```\na = [1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4....]\n```\n\nI want to subsample this array starting at `a[1]` and then sample every fourth point from there, to produce an output like this:\n\n```\nb = [2,2,2.....]\n```\n\nHow can I accomplish this with numpy?"

Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Your original array\na = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4])\n\n# Define the starting position and the step size\nstart_position = 1  # This is a[1], which corresponds to the second element\nstep_size = 4\n\n# Subsample the array\nb = a[start_position::step_size]\n\nprint(b)\n```\n\nThis code will give you the desired output:\n\n```\n[2 2 2]\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `start_position` is set to 1 because you want to start sampling from `a[1]`.\n- `step_size` is set to 4, as you want to take every fourth element starting from the position `a[1]`.\n- The slicing `a[start_position::step_size]` starts from `a[1]` and takes every fourth element until the end of the array."
