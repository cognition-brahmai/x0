In my code, I have a lambda function sum and another lambda function incr that calls sum with the argument 1 and another variable y. I understand that when I call incr with an argument, that argument is passed as y to sum. However, I am confused about a similar function incr2 that uses functools.partial. The partial function seems to take the function sum2 and the argument 1, but when I call incr2 with the argument 4, it seems like 4 is passed as x in sum2. How does this work? Why doesn't 4 replace sum2 instead?\n\n```python\nsum = lambda x, y : x + y\nsum(1, 2)  # returns 3\nincr = lambda y : sum(1, y)\nincr(2)  # returns 3\ndef sum2(x, y):\n    return x + y\nincr2 = functools.partial(sum2, 1)\nincr2(4)  # returns 5\n```"

        "content": "The confusion seems to be stemming from the way `functools.partial` works in Python. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Lambda Function `incr`:**  \n   The lambda function `incr` is defined as `lambda y : sum(1, y)`. When you call `incr(2)`, it effectively calls `sum(1, 2)`. Here, the argument `2` is passed as the second argument `y` to the lambda function `sum`.\n\n2. **Function `incr2` with `functools.partial`:**  \n   The `functools.partial` function is used to fix a certain number of arguments of a function and generate a new function. In your code, `incr2 = functools.partial(sum2, 1)` creates a new function where the first argument of `sum2` is fixed to `1`. This means `incr2` is a function that takes whatever arguments are passed to it and calls `sum2` with `1` as the first argument, followed by the arguments you provide.\n\n   When you call `incr2(4)`, it is equivalent to calling `sum2(1, 4)`. The number `1` is the fixed argument from `functools.partial`, and `4` is the argument you provided to `incr2`, which gets passed as the second argument to `sum2`.\n\nThe key point is that `functools.partial` effectively pre-fills some of the arguments of the function it wraps. In your example:\n\n- `sum2(x, y)` becomes `sum2(1, y)` when wrapped with `functools.partial(sum2, 1)`.\n- When you call `incr2(4)`, `4` is passed as `y` and `x` is already set to `1`, resulting in `1 + 4 = 5`. \n\nOverall, `functools.partial` is great for creating functions with some preset arguments, leading to more concise and flexible code."
