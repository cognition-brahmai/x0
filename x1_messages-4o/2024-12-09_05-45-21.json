        "content": "To verify if PyTorch is utilizing the GPU directly within a Python script, you can use the PyTorch library itself to check the device allocation of your tensors and models. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:\n\n1. **Check if CUDA is available:**\n   First, you can verify that CUDA is available on your system, which indicates that PyTorch can use the GPU.\n\n   ```python\n   import torch\n\n   if torch.cuda.is_available():\n       print(\"CUDA is available. PyTorch can use the GPU.\")\n   else:\n       print(\"CUDA is not available. PyTorch will use the CPU.\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Check the current device:**\n   You can check the current CUDA device and the device properties.\n\n   ```python\n   print(\"Current CUDA device:\", torch.cuda.current_device())\n   print(\"Device name:\", torch.cuda.get_device_name(torch.cuda.current_device()))\n   ```\n\n3. **Move a tensor to GPU and check its device:**\n   To confirm that operations are being carried out on the GPU, you can create a tensor and move it to the GPU. Then, check the device of the tensor.\n\n   ```python\n   # Create a tensor\n   tensor = torch.rand(3, 3)\n\n   # Move the tensor to GPU\n   tensor = tensor.to('cuda')\n\n   # Check the device\n   print(\"Tensor is on device:\", tensor.device)\n   ```\n\n4. **Ensure your model is on the GPU:**\n   If you are working with a model, make sure to move it to the GPU as well.\n\n   ```python\n   # Example: Define a simple model\n   model = torch.nn.Linear(3, 3)\n\n   # Move the model to GPU\n   model = model.to('cuda')\n\n   # Check if the model's parameters are on the GPU\n   for param in model.parameters():\n       print(param.device)\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you can confirm within your Python script that PyTorch is utilizing the GPU for computations. If the tensors and model parameters are on the CUDA device, it means PyTorch is indeed using the GPU."
