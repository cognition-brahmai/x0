        "content": "The error message you're encountering suggests that the `bdist_wheel` command is not recognized, which typically indicates that the `wheel` package is not properly installed or recognized in the execution environment. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue on the Travis CI Trusty Beta VM:\n\n1. **Ensure Wheel is Installed in the Correct Environment:**\n   Make sure that the `wheel` package is installed in the same Python environment where `setup.py` is executed. You might want to specifically install `wheel` in your virtual environment if you're using one.\n\n   ```shell\n   pip install wheel\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Python Environment:**\n   Verify that the `setup.py` command is being run with the same Python interpreter where `wheel` is installed. You can ensure this by invoking the Python interpreter directly:\n\n   ```shell\n   python -m pip install wheel\n   python setup.py bdist_wheel\n   ```\n\n3. **Upgrade setuptools and pip:**\n   Sometimes, older versions of setuptools or pip can cause issues. Ensure they are up to date:\n\n   ```shell\n   python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools\n   ```\n\n4. **Use Virtual Environments:**\n   It's a good practice to use virtual environments to isolate dependencies. You can create a virtual environment and install the necessary packages within it:\n\n   ```shell\n   virtualenv venv\n   source venv/bin/activate\n   pip install wheel setuptools\n   python setup.py bdist_wheel\n   ```\n\n5. **Check Travis Configuration:**\n   Ensure your `.travis.yml` file is correctly set up to use the desired Python version and dependencies. For example:\n\n   ```yaml\n   language: python\n   python:\n     - \"2.7\"\n   install:\n     - pip install -U pip setuptools wheel\n   script:\n     - python setup.py bdist_wheel\n   ```\n\n6. **Check for Errors in Setup Scripts:**\n   If none of the above solutions work, double-check your `setup.py` script for any potential issues that might be interfering with package installation or command recognition.\n\n7. **Review Travis Logs:**\n   Look at the Travis CI build logs to see if there are any specific error messages or warnings that provide more insight into what might be going wrong.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with the `bdist_wheel` command on Travis CI. If problems persist, consider reaching out to the Travis CI community or forums for additional support."
