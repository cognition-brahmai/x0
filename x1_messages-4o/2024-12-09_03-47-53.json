        "content": "The error you're encountering, `tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.NotFoundError`, indicates that TensorFlow is unable to find the file at the specified path `\"/tf_files/retrained_labels.txt\"`. This could be due to a few reasons:\n\n1. **Incorrect File Path**: The file path you're using might be incorrect or it might not exist. Make sure that the file `retrained_labels.txt` is indeed present in the directory `/tf_files/`. \n\n2. **Absolute vs Relative Path**: The path `\"/tf_files/retrained_labels.txt\"` is an absolute path. Ensure that this is the correct path to where your file is located. If you're working in a different directory, you might need to use a relative path or adjust the absolute path accordingly.\n\n3. **File Permissions**: Check the file permissions to ensure that the file is readable by your user or the process running the TensorFlow script.\n\n4. **Current Working Directory**: Make sure that your script's working directory is set correctly. If you're running the script from a different directory, it might not be able to find the file. You can check the current working directory using Python with:\n   ```python\n   import os\n   print(os.getcwd())\n   ```\n\n5. **Environment Configuration**: If you're working within an environment, such as a Docker container or a virtual environment, ensure that the environment has access to the file path.\n\nTo resolve the issue:\n\n- Verify that the file `retrained_labels.txt` exists at the specified path.\n- If the file is located somewhere else, update the path in your script to point to the correct location.\n- Consider using a relative path if your script and the file are in the same or nearby directories.\n- Check your script's current working directory to ensure it's set correctly.\n\nHere is an example of how you might adjust the code to use a relative path:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Assuming 'retrained_labels.txt' is in the same directory as your script\nfile_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \"tf_files\", \"retrained_labels.txt\")\n\nwith tf.gfile.GFile(file_path) as f:\n    labels = [line.strip() for line in f.readlines()]\n```\n\nMake sure to adjust the path according to your actual directory structure."
