I have a function, for example:\n\n```python\ndef x():\n    print(20)\n```\n\nI want to assign this function to a variable named 'y', so that when I use 'y', it executes function 'x'. However, when I try to assign it using the syntax 'y = x()', it returns 'None'. How can I correctly assign a function to a variable?"

        "content": "In Python, when you assign a function to a variable, you should not include parentheses after the function name. Using parentheses would actually call the function and assign its return value (which is `None` in your case) to the variable. Instead, you should assign the function itself without calling it.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef x():\n    print(20)\n\n# Assign the function to a variable without calling it\ny = x\n\n# Now, you can use 'y' to call the function\ny()  # This will print 20\n```\n\nIn this example, `y` becomes a reference to the function `x`. When you call `y()`, it executes the code within the function `x`."
