I am encountering an issue while trying to install modules that rely on `clang` for compilation. The error message I am getting is `clang: error: invalid version number in 'MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0'`. This issue seems to be common and arises when I try to install multiple modules with `clang` dependencies, for instance, when I run `pip install multidict`. I have also tried installing older versions of Command Line Tools, for instance, 11.5, but it did not solve the problem. Can you provide a solution for this issue?"

        "content": "This is a known issue that arises due to the way the `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` environment variable is being set when using certain versions of `clang` on macOS Big Sur, particularly with beta versions. The error occurs because the `clang` compiler is expecting a version number that it recognizes, and the default setup with `pyenv` and certain versions of `clang` might not handle macOS Big Sur's version number correctly.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to help you resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Upgrade macOS and Command Line Tools**: First, ensure that you have the latest stable version of macOS and the corresponding Command Line Tools installed. This can help as newer versions might have fixes for compatibility issues.\n\n2. **Update `pyenv` and Python**: Make sure you have the latest version of `pyenv` installed. If you haven't updated recently, you can do so with:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew update\n   brew upgrade pyenv\n   ```\n\n   Then, try installing a newer version of Python, if available, using `pyenv`. This can sometimes have better compatibility with macOS Big Sur.\n\n3. **Set the `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` Environment Variable Manually**: You can override the environment variable manually to ensure it uses a compatible version number. Try setting it to `10.15`, for example:\n\n   ```bash\n   export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.15\n   ```\n\n   You can add this line to your shell profile (e.g., `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, etc.) to make the change persistent across sessions.\n\n4. **Use a Compatible Version of `clang`**: You can specify a different version of `clang` if you have multiple versions installed. Sometimes using `gcc` instead of `clang` can also solve the problem. You can switch compilers by specifying the `CC` environment variable:\n\n   ```bash\n   export CC=gcc\n   ```\n\n5. **Install Modules with a Wheel or Precompiled Binaries**: If the module you're trying to install offers a precompiled binary or wheel file, use that instead. This avoids the need for compilation entirely. You can search for wheel files with:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip search <module-name> --only-binary :all:\n   ```\n\n6. **Consider Using Virtual Environments**: If not already using them, virtual environments can help manage dependencies and configurations more cleanly, reducing the risk of conflicts.\n\n7. **Check for Known Issues and Patches**: Sometimes, specific modules might have patches or workarounds posted by the community. Check the module's GitHub issues page or forums for any workarounds or updates related to macOS Big Sur.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with `clang` and successfully install the necessary Python modules."
