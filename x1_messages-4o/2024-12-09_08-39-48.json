For instance, I have the following code:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\n...\n\ndef exec_adb_command(adb_command):\n    return subprocess.call(adb_command)\n```\n\nThe function `exec_adb_command` returns 0 if the command executed properly which is OK. However, some adb commands not only return \"0\" or \"1\" but also generate some output, like `adb devices`, that I would like to capture as well. For example:\n\n```bash\nD:\\git\\adb-lib\\test&gt;adb devices\nList of devices attached\n07eeb4bb        device\n```\n\nI've tried `subprocess.check_output()` to capture the output, but it does not return the return code. Ideally, I would want a tuple where t[0] is return code and t[1] is actual output. Is there something I am missing in the subprocess module which allows me to get these kinds of results?"

        "content": "To capture both the output and the return code from an adb command executed using the `subprocess` module in Python, you can use the `subprocess.run()` function, which provides a more flexible way to execute commands and capture their outputs. Here's how you can modify your `exec_adb_command` function to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\ndef exec_adb_command(adb_command):\n    # Run the command and capture both stdout and stderr\n    result = subprocess.run(adb_command, shell=True, text=True, capture_output=True)\n    \n    # Return a tuple containing the return code and the output\n    return result.returncode, result.stdout.strip()\n\n# Example usage\nadb_command = \"adb devices\"\nreturn_code, output = exec_adb_command(adb_command)\nprint(f\"Return code: {return_code}\")\nprint(\"Output:\", output)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`subprocess.run()`**: This function is recommended for running shell commands in Python as it provides more options and a cleaner interface compared to `subprocess.call()` or `subprocess.check_output()`.\n  \n- **`shell=True`**: This parameter allows you to run the command through the shell. Be cautious with this option, especially if you're executing commands constructed from external input, as it can introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n- **`text=True`**: This ensures that the output is returned as a string (text mode) rather than bytes.\n\n- **`capture_output=True`**: This captures both stdout and stderr. You can access the output via `result.stdout` and any error messages via `result.stderr`.\n\n- **`result.returncode`**: This gives you the return code of the executed command.\n\n- **`result.stdout.strip()`**: This retrieves the command output while removing any leading or trailing whitespace, including newlines.\n\nBy using this approach, you can easily retrieve both the output and the return code of any adb command executed through your Python wrapper."
