        "content": "To sort a slice of structs in Go by multiple fields in descending order, you can use the `sort.Slice` function, which allows you to define a custom comparison function. In your case, you want to sort the `myData` struct first by `Age` and then by `Salary`, both in descending order. You've already provided the correct Go code to achieve this.\n\nHere's the code with explanations for clarity:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"sort\"\n)\n\ntype myData struct {\n    Name   string\n    Age    int\n    Salary float64\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    data := []myData{\n        {Name: \"John\", Age: 25, Salary: 50000},\n        {Name: \"Mary\", Age: 30, Salary: 60000},\n        {Name: \"Bob\", Age: 25, Salary: 55000},\n    }\n\n    // Sort the data slice by Age and Salary in descending order\n    sort.Slice(data, func(i, j int) bool {\n        // First compare by Age\n        if data[i].Age == data[j].Age {\n            // If Age is the same, compare by Salary\n            return data[i].Salary > data[j].Salary\n        }\n        // Otherwise, compare by Age\n        return data[i].Age > data[j].Age\n    })\n\n    fmt.Println(data)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Sort by Age**: The code checks if the `Age` field is the same for two elements `i` and `j`. If so, it proceeds to compare by `Salary`.\n- **Sort by Salary**: If `Age` is the same, it compares the `Salary` fields, sorting them in descending order.\n- **Descending Order**: The use of `>` ensures that the sorting is done in descending order for both `Age` and `Salary`.\n\nWhen you run this program, it will print the `data` slice sorted first by `Age` and then by `Salary`, both in descending order."
