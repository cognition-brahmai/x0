Specifically, I want to group my data by the 'State' column, then from each group, select the two counties with the largest populations. Finally, I would like to sum up the populations of these two counties for each state. I have managed to use `groupby` and `nlargest`, but I am struggling to get the sum of the `nlargest(2)`. The line of code I currently have is: `df.groupby('State')['Population'].nlargest(2)`. How can I modify it to achieve my goal?\n\nConsider the following example dataframe:\n```\nState    County    Population\nAlabama  a         100\nAlabama  b         50\nAlabama  c         40\nAlabama  d         5\nAlabama  e         1\n...\nWyoming  a.51      180\nWyoming  b.51      150\nWyoming  c.51      56\nWyoming  d.51      5\n```"

        "content": "To achieve your goal of grouping the data by 'State', selecting the two counties with the largest populations from each group, and then summing up the populations of these two counties for each state, you can proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. Use `groupby` to group the DataFrame by 'State'.\n2. Use `apply` in combination with `nlargest` to select the top two counties by population within each state.\n3. Sum up the populations of these two counties for each state.\n\nHere's how you can do this in code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'State': ['Alabama', 'Alabama', 'Alabama', 'Alabama', 'Alabama',\n              'Wyoming', 'Wyoming', 'Wyoming', 'Wyoming'],\n    'County': ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'a.51', 'b.51', 'c.51', 'd.51'],\n    'Population': [100, 50, 40, 5, 1, 180, 150, 56, 5]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Group by 'State', apply `nlargest` to get top 2 populations, and then sum them\nresult = df.groupby('State').apply(lambda x: x.nlargest(2, 'Population')['Population'].sum())\n\n# Reset the index to have a clean DataFrame\nresult = result.reset_index(name='Sum of Top 2 Populations')\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`groupby('State')`**: This groups the data by the 'State' column.\n- **`apply(lambda x: x.nlargest(2, 'Population'))`**: For each group, it applies a lambda function that uses `nlargest(2, 'Population')` to select the top two rows with the largest populations.\n- **`['Population'].sum()`**: Sums up the 'Population' values of these selected rows.\n- **`reset_index(name='Sum of Top 2 Populations')`**: Resets the index to transform the Series back into a DataFrame and renames the summed column appropriately.\n\nThis will give you a DataFrame where each row corresponds to a state, and the column provides the sum of the populations of the two largest counties in that state."
