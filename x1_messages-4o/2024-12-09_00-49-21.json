I am trying to calculate the sum of the \"price\" for all items in a queryset. I have attempted to use the following query: \"items = ItemPrice.objects.all().annotate(Sum('price'))\". However, this doesn't seem to be working as expected. Is there something wrong with this query or is there another way to calculate the sum of the \"price\" column? I am looking for a solution that doesn't involve using a for loop on the queryset.\n\n<pre><code>class ItemPrice( models.Model ):\n     price = models.DecimalField ( max_digits = 8, decimal_places=2 )\n     ....\n</code></pre>\n\n<pre><code>items = ItemPrice.objects.all().annotate(Sum('price'))\n</code></pre>"

        "content": "It looks like there is a small misunderstanding in how to use the `Sum` aggregation function in Django. When you want to calculate the total sum of a field for a queryset, you should use the `aggregate` method instead of `annotate`. The `annotate` method is used for adding an aggregate value for each item in a queryset, while `aggregate` calculates a single aggregate value for the entire queryset.\n\nHere's how you can calculate the sum of the `price` field for all `ItemPrice` objects:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db.models import Sum\n\ntotal_price = ItemPrice.objects.aggregate(total=Sum('price'))['total']\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `ItemPrice.objects.aggregate(total=Sum('price'))` returns a dictionary with the key `'total'` and the value as the sum of all `price` values in the queryset.\n- `['total']` is used to extract the actual sum value from the dictionary.\n\nThis will give you the total sum of the `price` field across all items in the `ItemPrice` model."
