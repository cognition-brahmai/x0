I've tried using the ' and _ characters, which act as digit separators in some other programming languages, but they don't seem to work with Python. Could there possibly be an operator which concatenates its left hand side with its right hand side to serve this purpose?"

        "content": "Yes, Python supports the use of underscores as digit separators in numeric literals for increased readability. This feature was introduced in Python 3.6. You can use underscores to group digits in integer literals, floating-point literals, and even complex numbers.\n\nHere's how you can use underscores as digit separators in Python:\n\n```python\n# Integer literals\nlarge_number = 1_000_000\nprint(large_number)  # Output: 1000000\n\n# Floating-point literals\npi = 3.141_592_653_589_793\nprint(pi)  # Output: 3.141592653589793\n\n# Hexadecimal literals\nhex_number = 0x_FF_FF_FF\nprint(hex_number)  # Output: 16777215\n\n# Binary literals\nbinary_number = 0b_1010_1010\nprint(binary_number)  # Output: 170\n\n# Octal literals\noctal_number = 0o_755\nprint(octal_number)  # Output: 493\n```\n\nThe underscores are ignored by the Python interpreter, so they do not affect the value of the literal; they simply make the code more readable.\n\nAs for concatenating numbers using operators, there isn't a direct operator for concatenating numbers like strings, but you can achieve similar functionality using string manipulation if needed. However, for readability purposes in literals, using underscores is the recommended approach."
