Instead of writing the exact amount like `some_time: 86400`, I want to use arithmetic like `some_time: 1 * 24 * 60 * 60`. However, when I use such an arithmetic line, it treats the configuration line as a string. Is there any way to perform arithmetic directly in YAML without having to evaluate the string later with `eval(config['some_time'])`?"

        "content": "YAML, by design, is a data serialization language and does not support direct arithmetic operations. It is intended to be a straightforward format for data storage and doesn't include capabilities for computation or logic execution like arithmetic operations.\n\nHowever, there are a few approaches you can take to handle arithmetic-like expressions in YAML:\n\n1. **Use a Scripting Layer:** Since YAML itself can't perform arithmetic, you should use a scripting or programming language to evaluate these expressions after loading the YAML file. For example, in Python, you can use `eval()` or a safer alternative like `sympy` or `asteval` to compute the expressions.\n\n   ```yaml\n   some_time: !!str 1 * 24 * 60 * 60\n   ```\n\n   ```python\n   import yaml\n\n   with open('config.yaml', 'r') as file:\n       config = yaml.safe_load(file)\n\n   some_time = eval(config['some_time'])\n   print(some_time)  # Outputs: 86400\n   ```\n\n2. **Use Anchors and Aliases:** If you have repetitive patterns, you can use YAML anchors and aliases to avoid repetition, but this won't handle arithmetic.\n\n   ```yaml\n   day_in_seconds: &day_in_seconds 86400\n   some_time: *day_in_seconds\n   ```\n\n3. **Preprocessing:** Before loading YAML, preprocess the file with a script that performs the arithmetic operations and writes the computed values back to YAML.\n\n4. **Custom YAML Tags:** You could implement custom YAML tags to handle specific operations if your parser supports it. This would require extending the parser to evaluate specific tags as arithmetic operations.\n\nFor most practical purposes, it's best to handle any necessary computations in the code that reads and processes the YAML data. This ensures that the YAML remains simple and focused on data representation, while the logic is handled in a more appropriate environment."
