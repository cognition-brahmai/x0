For instance, when creating a virtual environment, we use: `python3 -m venv my_env`. What does \"-m\" stand for and what is the difference when we run the command without the \"-m\" option? Also, is this a characteristic specific to Python 3?"

        "content": "The `-m` option in Python is used to run a library module as a script. When you use `-m`, you're telling Python to locate the module specified and execute its content as if it were a script. This is particularly useful for running modules that come with Python or are installed in your environment.\n\nHere's what happens with `python3 -m venv my_env`:\n\n1. **`-m` option**: This tells Python to run the `venv` module as a script. The `venv` module is part of the Python standard library and is used for creating virtual environments.\n\n2. **Without `-m`**: If you run a command without the `-m` option, Python will look for a script file with that name in the current directory or on the system path. So, running something like `python3 venv my_env` would cause Python to search for a script named `venv` in your current directory or in your system path, which likely doesn't exist unless you've specifically created it.\n\n3. **Characteristics specific to Python 3**: The `-m` option is not specific to Python 3; it is available in Python 2 as well. However, Python 3 introduced the `venv` module, which is used to create virtual environments. In Python 2, virtual environments were typically created using the third-party `virtualenv` package, which is not included in the standard library.\n\nIn summary, using `-m` allows you to run modules that are part of Python's standard library or installed packages as if they were standalone scripts. This provides a convenient way to execute certain functionalities without needing to write separate script files for them."
