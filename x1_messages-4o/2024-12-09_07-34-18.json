The program I'm testing is computationally expensive, so I would not like to terminate it prematurely, but would rather have the script attempt to complete its execution. I tried using the 'continue' command, but it doesn't seem to work as expected. How can I exit the pdb debugger and allow my program to continue running until it completes?"

        "content": "When you're using the Python debugger (`pdb`), the `continue` command is typically used to resume execution until the next breakpoint is encountered. If you find that using `continue` is not working as expected and you want to exit the debugger completely and let the program continue to run until completion without any further interruption, you can use the `quit` command to exit `pdb`. However, `quit` will terminate the script execution entirely, which is not what you want in this case.\n\nInstead, if you're looking to exit the debugger and let the script run uninterrupted to completion, you should:\n\n1. Remove or disable any breakpoints that might cause the debugger to pause execution again. You can do this with the `clear` command followed by the line number or `clear` without arguments to remove all breakpoints.\n\n2. Make sure you're not using any commands or configurations that might cause the debugger to stop again.\n\n3. Once all breakpoints are cleared, you can use the `continue` command, and it should run the program to completion without stopping.\n\nIf for some reason `continue` isn't letting the program run to completion as expected, double-check for any remaining breakpoints or conditions that might be causing the interruption. Also, ensure that you're executing the script without any additional debugging flags or configurations that might re-enter the debugger."
