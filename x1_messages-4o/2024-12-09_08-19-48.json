However, when my code, which goes through a list of sites and grabs JSON data from each, runs, I keep seeing the error \"Attempt to decode JSON with unexpected mimetype: txt/html; charset=utf-8\" in my console. Can this error be fixed or hidden? Here is a simplified version of my code:\n\n```python\nPoolName = \"http://website.com\"\nendpoint = \"/api/stats\"\nheaders = \"headers = {'content-type': 'text/html'}\" #Ive tried \"application/json\" and no headers\nasync with aiohttp.get(url=PoolName+endpoint, headers=headers) as hashrate:\n                hashrate = await hashrate.json()\nendVariable = hashrate['GLRC']['HASH']\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that the server is returning a response with a `Content-Type` of `text/html`, which is not what you expect when you're trying to parse it as JSON. This usually means that the server is either returning an error page or the endpoint does not provide JSON data.\n\nHere's how you might address this issue:\n\n1. **Check the Correct Endpoint and Method**: Ensure that the endpoint you're hitting is correct and that it returns JSON data. Also, ensure that you are using the correct HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, etc.).\n\n2. **Modify Headers**: It seems you have a typo in your headers definition. It should be a dictionary, not a string. You might not need to set the `Content-Type` header for GET requests, as it's usually used in POST requests to specify the type of data being sent. However, if the server requires a specific header, ensure it's set properly.\n\n3. **Handle Non-JSON Responses**: Before attempting to parse the response as JSON, you can check the content type and handle cases where it isn't JSON.\n\nHere's an updated version of your code with these considerations:\n\n```python\nimport aiohttp\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def fetch_data():\n    PoolName = \"http://website.com\"\n    endpoint = \"/api/stats\"\n    \n    # Correctly define headers as a dictionary\n    headers = {'Accept': 'application/json'}  # 'Accept' is typically used for GET requests\n\n    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n        async with session.get(url=PoolName + endpoint, headers=headers) as response:\n            # Check the content type\n            if response.headers['Content-Type'].startswith('application/json'):\n                try:\n                    hashrate = await response.json()\n                    endVariable = hashrate['GLRC']['HASH']\n                    print(endVariable)\n                except aiohttp.ContentTypeError:\n                    print(\"Response is not JSON\")\n            else:\n                # Handle non-JSON response\n                text = await response.text()\n                print(f\"Unexpected content type: {response.headers['Content-Type']}\")\n                print(f\"Response text: {text}\")\n\n# Run the async function\nasyncio.run(fetch_data())\n```\n\n**Key Points**:\n- Ensure the headers are correctly defined.\n- Check the `Content-Type` of the response before attempting to decode it as JSON.\n- Handle cases where the response is not JSON by printing the response text or taking other appropriate actions.\n\nThis should help you understand what's going wrong with your requests and how to handle unexpected responses."
