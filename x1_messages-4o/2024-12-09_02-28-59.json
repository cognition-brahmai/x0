When I run `pylint --version`, the output shows I am using Python 2.6.6, but my virtualenv actually has Python 2.7 installed. How can I resolve this discrepancy?\n\n```\n$ pylint --version\npylint 0.21.1,\nastng 0.20.1, common 0.50.3\nPython 2.6.6 (r266:84292, Jul 10 2013, 22:48:45)\n[GCC 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-3)]\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is likely due to `pylint` being installed outside of your virtual environment, which is why it is using a different Python version than the one in your virtualenv. To resolve this, you need to ensure that `pylint` is installed within your virtualenv and that your shell environment is correctly pointing to it.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to help you resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Activate Your Virtual Environment:**\n   Ensure your virtual environment is activated. From your shell, navigate to your virtualenv directory and activate it:\n\n   ```bash\n   source /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify Python Version in Virtualenv:**\n   Check the Python version within your virtual environment to confirm it's the desired version (Python 2.7 in your case):\n\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Pylint in Your Virtualenv:**\n   Make sure `pylint` is installed in your activated virtual environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pylint\n   ```\n\n4. **Check Pylint Version and Python Interpreter:**\n   Once installed, check the `pylint` version and ensure it's using the correct Python interpreter:\n\n   ```bash\n   pylint --version\n   ```\n\n   This should now reflect the Python version from your virtual environment.\n\n5. **Ensure Shell Environment is Correct:**\n   Make sure your shell is using the virtual environment's `pylint` by checking the path:\n\n   ```bash\n   which pylint\n   ```\n\n   This should point to the `pylint` inside your virtualenv, something like `/path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/pylint`.\n\n6. **Deactivate and Reactivate (if necessary):**\n   If you still encounter issues, try deactivating and reactivating your virtual environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   deactivate\n   source /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\nThese steps should help align `pylint` with the Python interpreter in your virtual environment. If the problem persists, consider checking for any lingering global configurations or paths that might be interfering."
