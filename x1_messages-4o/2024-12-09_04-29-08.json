However, I noticed that unlike other languages, there is no decorator like `@override` provided for when the subclass overrides the superclass method. This makes it a bit difficult for someone reading the code to quickly determine which methods override or implement abstract methods versus methods that only exist in the subclass. Could anyone explain the reasoning behind this?"

        "content": "In Python, the decision not to include an `@override` decorator, like those found in some other languages (such as Java), is primarily due to Python's dynamic and flexible nature. Here are a few reasons why Python doesn't have an `@override` decorator by default:\n\n1. **Dynamic Typing and Duck Typing**: Python is a dynamically typed language that embraces the concept of \"duck typing.\" This means that behavior is more important than the actual type of an object. As long as an object implements the required methods, its type doesn't matter. This philosophy doesn't strongly emphasize type constraints, which reduces the perceived need for an `@override` decorator.\n\n2. **Explicit is Better than Implicit**: Python's design philosophy, as outlined in the Zen of Python (PEP 20), includes the principle \"Explicit is better than implicit.\" While decorators like `@abstractmethod` make it clear that a method must be implemented, the language encourages reading the code to understand which methods are overridden. Adding an `@override` decorator is seen as potentially unnecessary additional syntax that doesn't align with Python's principles.\n\n3. **Readability and Simplicity**: Python emphasizes code readability and simplicity. There is a belief in the community that adding an `@override` decorator might clutter the code without providing significant benefits, as most Python developers are expected to read through the code to understand its structure and behavior.\n\n4. **Community and Flexibility**: Python's community often creates custom solutions to address specific needs. If you feel that having an `@override` decorator would enhance your code's readability, you can easily implement your own custom decorator to signal overridden methods. This flexibility allows developers to tailor their code to their preferences without altering the language's core principles.\n\nIn summary, the lack of an `@override` decorator in Python is aligned with the language's dynamic nature, simplicity, and emphasis on readability. While it might require more manual inspection of the code to determine overridden methods, this design choice reflects Python's philosophy of keeping the language clean and flexible."
