        "content": "You have been tasked with calculating the average weight of all animals in a zoo for the month of August. However, there are several issues that you need to address in your approach. \nFirstly, the calculation process can be time-consuming and complex. To handle this, you need to use a divide-and-conquer approach and break down the calculation into smaller, more manageable components. \nSecondly, there is a potential for errors in the data. To address this, you need to implement proper data validation measures, such as removing any negative values or outliers. \nThirdly, there may be privacy concerns when handling animal data. To address this, you need to implement proper access control measures, such as only allowing authorized personnel to access the data or using encryption for sensitive information. \nTo start, you are given a list of dictionaries representing the animals in the zoo for the month of August. Each dictionary contains the following keys:\n- name: the name of the animal (string)\n- weight_august: the weight of the animal for the month of August (float)\n- species: the species of the animal (string)\nYour task is to write a Python function that calculates the average weight of all animals in the zoo for the month of August. Your function should implement data validation measures and access control measures to ensure the privacy of animal data. Your function should return the average weight as a float, rounded to two decimal places."

        "content": "To address the problem, we'll implement a Python function that calculates the average weight of animals in the zoo for the month of August. We'll use a divide-and-conquer approach to break down the task, implement data validation to ensure the accuracy of the data, and consider access control for privacy concerns. \n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Dict\n\ndef calculate_average_weight(animals: List[Dict[str, any]]) -> float:\n    def validate_data(animal: Dict[str, any]) -> bool:\n        \"\"\" Validate the data for each animal entry. \"\"\"\n        try:\n            weight = animal['weight_august']\n            # Check if weight is a float and is positive\n            if not isinstance(weight, (int, float)) or weight < 0:\n                return False\n        except (KeyError, TypeError):\n            return False\n        \n        return True\n    \n    def calculate_average(weights: List[float]) -> float:\n        \"\"\" Calculate the average weight. \"\"\"\n        if not weights:\n            return 0.0\n        return round(sum(weights) / len(weights), 2)\n    \n    def encrypt_data(data: str) -> str:\n        \"\"\" Mock encryption function to illustrate privacy handling. \"\"\"\n        # In a real-world scenario, use a proper encryption library\n        return ''.join(chr(ord(char) + 2) for char in data)\n    \n    def is_authorized(user: str) -> bool:\n        \"\"\" Check if the user is authorized to access the data. \"\"\"\n        # Mock user authorization check\n        authorized_users = {\"zookeeper\", \"admin\"}\n        return user in authorized_users\n    \n    # Simulating a user check\n    current_user = \"zookeeper\"  # Example: this would be dynamically checked in a real system\n    if not is_authorized(current_user):\n        raise PermissionError(\"Access denied: unauthorized user.\")\n    \n    # Divide and conquer approach: Process each animal entry\n    valid_weights = []\n    for animal in animals:\n        if validate_data(animal):\n            valid_weights.append(animal['weight_august'])\n        else:\n            print(f\"Invalid data found for: {encrypt_data(animal['name'])}\")\n    \n    # Calculate and return the average weight\n    return calculate_average(valid_weights)\n\n# Example usage:\nanimals = [\n    {\"name\": \"Lion\", \"weight_august\": 190.5, \"species\": \"Panthera leo\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Elephant\", \"weight_august\": 5400.0, \"species\": \"Loxodonta\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Giraffe\", \"weight_august\": 800.2, \"species\": \"Giraffa camelopardalis\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Zebra\", \"weight_august\": -150.0, \"species\": \"Equus quagga\"},  # Invalid weight\n]\n\naverage_weight = calculate_average_weight(animals)\nprint(f\"The average weight of animals in August is: {average_weight} kg\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Data Validation:** \n   - We check if the weight is a positive number.\n   - We catch any potential errors during data extraction.\n\n2. **Divide and Conquer:** \n   - We break down the task by iterating over each animal and validating its data before processing.\n\n3. **Access Control and Privacy:** \n   - We include a mock function `is_authorized` to simulate user authorization.\n   - We demonstrate a simple encryption function `encrypt_data` to protect sensitive information like animal names in logs. In a real scenario, use proper encryption techniques.\n\n4. **Average Calculation:** \n   - We gather all valid weights and calculate the average, rounding it to two decimal places for precision.\n\nThis approach ensures that data is processed efficiently, errors are minimized, and privacy concerns are addressed."
