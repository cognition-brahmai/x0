I used to be able to create a module like this in Python 2:\n\n```\nparent\n->module\n  ->__init__.py (init calls 'from file import ClassName')\n    file.py\n    ->class ClassName(obj)\n```\nThis worked in Python 2 and it works in Python 3 when I do it from the command interpreter. However, if I create an `__init__.py` file and do the same like this:\n\n`__init__.py` file:\n```\nfrom file import ClassName\n```\n`file.py` file:\n```\nclass ClassName(object): ...etc etc\n```\nI get an ImportError saying `cannot import name 'ClassName'`. It seems that it doesn't see 'file' at all. The error happens as soon as I import the module even though I can import everything by referencing it directly, which I don't want to do as it's inconsistent with the rest of our codebase. What could be the issue?"

        "content": "In Python 3, the import system has become more strict, especially concerning relative imports, and this can sometimes cause issues when transitioning from Python 2 to Python 3. The problem you're experiencing could be related to how imports are being resolved. Let's go through some steps to troubleshoot and fix the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Directory Structure**: Double-check that your directory structure is correct and that you have an `__init__.py` file in your `module` directory. This file can be empty, but its presence indicates to Python that the directory should be treated as a package.\n\n2. **Use Explicit Relative Imports**: In Python 3, it's often better to use explicit relative imports when you're working within a package. Modify your `__init__.py` file like this:\n   ```python\n   from .file import ClassName\n   ```\n\n3. **Check the Module Path**: Make sure that the directory containing your `parent` directory is in the Python path. If you're running a script from outside the package, you might need to adjust the `PYTHONPATH` or use a script that resides inside the `parent` directory.\n\n4. **Use Absolute Imports**: If you prefer absolute imports, you can do so by specifying the full package path. For example, if your directory structure is like this:\n   ```\n   parent/\n       __init__.py\n       module/\n           __init__.py\n           file.py\n   ```\n   You can use an absolute import:\n   ```python\n   from module.file import ClassName\n   ```\n\n5. **Running as a Script**: If you are running a script directly that is inside the `module` directory, this can sometimes interfere with imports due to the way Python sets up the module path. Consider running your script with the `-m` flag to treat it as a module:\n   ```bash\n   python -m parent.module.your_script\n   ```\n\n6. **Check for Name Conflicts**: Ensure there are no conflicting names that might cause import issues. For example, ensure there is no other module named `file` that might be shadowing your intended module.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the import error and correctly import `ClassName` from `file.py`."
