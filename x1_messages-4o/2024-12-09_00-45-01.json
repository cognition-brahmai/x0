I would also like to ignore any unexpected arguments. For example, I need to find out if \"debug\" was passed among parameters as shown below:\n\n```python\nif 'debug' in argv[1:]:\n  print 'Will be running in debug mode.'\n```\n\nHow do I find out if 009 or 575 was passed? The expected calls are as follows:\n\n```python\npython script.py\npython script.py 011\npython script.py 256 debug\npython script.py 391 xls\npython script.py 999 debug pdf\n```\n\nI don't care about calls like these:\n\n```python\npython script.py 001 002 245 568\npython script.py some unexpected argument\npython script.py 0001\npython script.py 02\n```\nThe first call isn't needed because of more than one \"numeric\" argument; the second due to an unexpected argument; and the third and fourth because of non-three-digit arguments."

        "content": "To process command-line arguments in Python while handling the specific conditions you mentioned, you can use the `sys` module. Here's a script that demonstrates how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef is_valid_number(arg):\n    # Check if the argument is a three-digit number in the range 001 to 999\n    return arg.isdigit() and len(arg) == 3 and 1 <= int(arg) <= 999\n\ndef main():\n    # Get the command-line arguments, excluding the script name\n    args = sys.argv[1:]\n\n    # Initialize variables to track the three-digit number and debug mode\n    number = None\n    debug_mode = False\n\n    for arg in args:\n        if is_valid_number(arg):\n            # If we've already found a valid number, ignore further numbers\n            if number is not None:\n                print(\"Ignoring call due to more than one numeric argument.\")\n                return\n            number = arg\n        elif arg == 'debug':\n            debug_mode = True\n        else:\n            # If an unexpected argument is found, ignore this call\n            print(\"Ignoring call due to unexpected argument:\", arg)\n            return\n\n    if debug_mode:\n        print(\"Will be running in debug mode.\")\n\n    if number is not None:\n        print(\"Found valid number:\", number)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Function `is_valid_number(arg)`**: This checks if the argument is a valid three-digit number between 001 and 999.\n\n2. **Loop Through `args`**: We loop through the command-line arguments to process them according to your requirements:\n   - Check if the argument is a valid three-digit number.\n   - If a number is already found and another number appears, print a message and return.\n   - If \"debug\" is found, set `debug_mode` to `True`.\n   - If an unexpected argument is found, print a message and return.\n\n3. **Output**:\n   - Print messages regarding \"debug mode\" and the valid number found.\n\nThis script will handle the requirements as described, including ignoring calls with unexpected arguments or multiple numeric arguments."
