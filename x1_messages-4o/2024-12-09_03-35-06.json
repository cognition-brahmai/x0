        "content": "Python's standard library does not include a module specifically for implementing balanced binary trees like AVL trees or red-black trees. However, you can use third-party libraries that provide these data structures. Some popular libraries that offer balanced binary trees include:\n\n1. **`bintrees`**: This library provides AVL and red-black trees. You can install it via pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install bintrees\n   ```\n\n2. **`sortedcontainers`**: While not specifically AVL or red-black trees, this library offers sorted list, dict, and set types that provide similar functionality:\n   ```bash\n   pip install sortedcontainers\n   ```\n\n3. **`blist`**: Provides a list-like type with optimized operations for certain use cases, including efficient insertion and deletion:\n   ```bash\n   pip install blist\n   ```\n\nThese libraries are not part of the standard library, but they are well-maintained and widely used for implementing balanced tree structures in Python."
