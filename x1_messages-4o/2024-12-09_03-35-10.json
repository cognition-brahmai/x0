        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to how the `__new__` method is implemented in your `TestFailed` class. In Python, the `__new__` method is responsible for creating and returning a new instance of the class. If it doesn't return an instance of the class (or a subclass), it can lead to unexpected behavior like the error you're seeing.\n\nIn your code, the `__new__` method doesn't return anything, so it implicitly returns `None`, which is causing the `TypeError` you're seeing. To fix this, you need to properly implement the `__new__` method and also define an `__init__` method to initialize the instance attributes. Here's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nclass TestFailed(BaseException):\n    def __new__(cls, m):\n        instance = super(TestFailed, cls).__new__(cls)\n        return instance\n    \n    def __init__(self, m):\n        self.message = m\n    \n    def __str__(self):\n        return self.message\n\ntry:\n    raise TestFailed('Oops')\nexcept TestFailed as x:\n    print(x)\n```\n\nIn this corrected version:\n\n- The `__new__` method is correctly using `super()` to call the parent class's `__new__` method and returning the instance.\n- The `__init__` method is added to initialize the `message` attribute.\n- The `print` statement is updated to use parentheses, which is compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3.\n\nThis should resolve the error, and the code should work as expected."
