        "content": "Certainly! An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase. To determine if two strings are anagrams, you can follow this algorithm:\n\n1. **Check Lengths**: First, check if the two strings have the same length. If not, they cannot be anagrams.\n\n2. **Sort and Compare**: \n   - Convert both strings to the same case to handle case insensitivity (e.g., convert both to lowercase).\n   - Sort the characters of both strings.\n   - Compare the sorted versions of the strings. If they are identical, the strings are anagrams.\n\nHere's a Python implementation of this algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef are_anagrams(str1, str2):\n    # Convert both strings to lowercase\n    str1 = str1.lower()\n    str2 = str2.lower()\n    \n    # If the lengths are different, they're not anagrams\n    if len(str1) != len(str2):\n        return False\n    \n    # Sort and compare\n    return sorted(str1) == sorted(str2)\n\n# Example usage:\nstr1 = \"listen\"\nstr2 = \"silent\"\nprint(are_anagrams(str1, str2))  # Output: True\n```\n\nThis method is simple and effective for determining if two strings are anagrams. It has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the length of the strings."
