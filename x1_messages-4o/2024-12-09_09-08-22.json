        "content": "Certainly! Here's a simple Python program that calculates the factorial of a positive integer using a function:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n < 0:\n        return \"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\"\n    elif n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        result = 1\n        for i in range(2, n + 1):\n            result *= i\n        return result\n\n# Example usage\nnumber = int(input(\"Enter a positive integer: \"))\nprint(f\"The factorial of {number} is {factorial(number)}.\")\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a given positive integer `n`. It checks for invalid input (negative numbers) and handles the special cases of `0` and `1`, returning the correct factorial value. The user is prompted to enter a positive integer, and the program then calculates and prints the factorial of that number."
