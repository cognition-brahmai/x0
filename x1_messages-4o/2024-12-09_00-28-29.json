        "content": "The error you're seeing, \"invalid command 'bdist_wheel'\", typically occurs when the `wheel` package is not installed. To resolve this issue, you'll need to install the `wheel` package using pip. Additionally, it's recommended to upgrade your `pip` and `setuptools` to more recent versions as yours are quite outdated. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Upgrade pip and setuptools**:\n   Open your terminal and run the following commands to upgrade `pip` and `setuptools`:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n   python -m pip install --upgrade setuptools\n   ```\n\n2. **Install the wheel package**:\n   After upgrading, install the `wheel` package:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m pip install wheel\n   ```\n\n3. **Re-run the bdist_wheel command**:\n   Now, try running the `bdist_wheel` command again:\n\n   ```bash\n   python setup.py bdist_wheel\n   ```\n\nThese steps should resolve the \"invalid command 'bdist_wheel'\" error, allowing you to successfully create a wheel distribution. If you continue to encounter issues, ensure your virtual environment (if using one) is activated and that you're using the correct Python interpreter."
