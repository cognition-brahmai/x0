However, when I run my code, I encounter an error that says \"ERROR: YouTube said: Unable to extract video data\". I researched this issue and found out that it might be because the program can't find any video info. How can I resolve this problem? Here is my code:\n\n```python\nimport youtube_dl \n\nydl_opt = {\"outtmpl\" : \"/videos/%(title)s.%(ext)s\", \"format\": \"bestaudio/best\"} \n\ndef operation(link):\n    \"\"\"\n    Start the download operation\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        with youtube_dl.YoutubeDL(ydl_opt) as yd: \n            video = yd.download([link]) \n        result.set(\"Your video has been downloaded !\")\n    except Exception:\n        result.set(\"Sorry, we got an error.\")\n\noperation(\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=...\")\n```"

        "content": "The error \"ERROR: YouTube said: Unable to extract video data\" typically occurs when the `youtube_dl` library is unable to access the necessary video information from YouTube. This can happen due to several reasons, such as changes in YouTube's website structure or restrictions on certain videos. Here's how you can try to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Update `youtube_dl`**: Ensure that you have the latest version of `youtube_dl`, as YouTube frequently changes its site structure, and the library needs to be updated to adapt to these changes. You can update it using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade youtube_dl\n   ```\n\n2. **Use `yt-dlp` as an alternative**: `yt-dlp` is a fork of `youtube_dl` that is more actively maintained and often incorporates fixes faster. You can try using `yt-dlp` instead. First, install it:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install yt-dlp\n   ```\n\n   Then, modify your code to use `yt-dlp`:\n\n   ```python\n   import yt_dlp as youtube_dl\n\n   ydl_opt = {\"outtmpl\": \"/videos/%(title)s.%(ext)s\", \"format\": \"bestaudio/best\"}\n\n   def operation(link):\n       \"\"\"\n       Start the download operation\n       \"\"\"\n       try:\n           with youtube_dl.YoutubeDL(ydl_opt) as yd:\n               video = yd.download([link])\n           result.set(\"Your video has been downloaded!\")\n       except Exception as e:\n           result.set(f\"Sorry, we got an error: {e}\")\n\n   operation(\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=...\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Check for URL issues**: Double-check the video URL to ensure it is correct and accessible from your network.\n\n4. **Use a VPN or Proxy**: Sometimes, videos may not be accessible from certain regions. Using a VPN or configuring a proxy in `youtube_dl` options might help.\n\n5. **Error Logging**: Modify the exception handling to print or log the actual error message to understand better what might be going wrong:\n\n   ```python\n   except Exception as e:\n       result.set(f\"Sorry, we got an error: {e}\")\n       print(e)\n   ```\n\nBy trying these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue or at least get more information about what's causing it."
