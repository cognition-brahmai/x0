I have a code snippet where I initialize a variable 'x' inside an 'if' statement, and then print it outside of the 'if' statement, like this:\n\n```python\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    x = 1\n\nprint x\n```\nIn other languages I've worked with, this would throw an exception because the variable 'x' is local to the 'if' statement and should not exist outside of it. But in Python, this code executes and prints '1'. Can anyone explain this behavior? Are all variables created in a Python module global and available to the entire module?"

        "content": "In Python, variables defined within a block like an `if` statement are not limited to the scope of that block. Instead, their scope extends to the entire function or module in which they are defined. This is different from some other programming languages where variables are limited to the block scope.\n\nIn your example:\n\n```python\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    x = 1\n\nprint(x)\n```\n\nThe variable `x` is defined inside the `if` block, but because Python doesn't have block-level scope for variables, `x` is accessible outside the `if` block as long as it's within the same function or module. This is why the code executes and prints `1` without any exceptions.\n\nIn Python, the main scopes to be aware of are:\n\n1. **Local Scope:** Variables defined within a function. They are accessible only within that function.\n2. **Global Scope:** Variables defined at the top level of a module or script. They are accessible anywhere within that module.\n3. **Enclosed Scope (Closure):** Variables in the local scope of enclosing functions.\n4. **Built-in Scope:** Contains names that are predefined in Python.\n\nIn your case, since `x` is defined at the module level, it is considered to have a global scope within that module. Thus, it is accessible throughout the module, both inside and outside the `if` block.\n\nIf you want to restrict the scope of a variable to a specific block or logic, consider encapsulating the block inside a function."
