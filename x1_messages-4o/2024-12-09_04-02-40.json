I have tried the following code but it's not giving me the desired output.\n\nCode:\n\n```python\nimport sys\ntry:\n    try:\n        print x\n    except Exception, ex:\n        raise NameError\nexcept Exception, er:\n    print \"0\", sys.exc_info()[0]\n    print \"1\", sys.exc_info()[1]\n    print \"2\", sys.exc_info()[2]\n```\n\nThe output I'm getting is:\n\n```python\n0 <type 'exceptions.NameError'>\n1 \n2 <traceback object at 0xbd5fc8>\n```\n\nHowever, I want the output to look like this:\n\n```python\n0 NameError\n1\n2 Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"exception.py\", line 6, in <module>\n    raise NameError\n```\n\nI'm aware that the traceback module can do this easily, but I want to specifically understand the usage of the sys.exc_info()[2] object here."

        "content": "To achieve the desired output using `sys.exc_info()`, you need to extract and format the information from the exception and its traceback manually. The `sys.exc_info()` function returns a tuple containing three values: the exception type, the exception value, and the traceback object. You can use the `traceback` module to format the traceback object into a human-readable string.\n\nBelow is your modified code that captures the exception type, exception value, and formats the traceback to meet your requirements:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport traceback\n\ntry:\n    try:\n        print(x)  # Intentional error: 'x' is not defined\n    except Exception as ex:\n        raise NameError  # Raising a new exception\nexcept Exception as er:\n    ex_type, ex_value, ex_traceback = sys.exc_info()\n\n    # Extract and format the exception type\n    exception_type_name = ex_type.__name__\n    print(\"0\", exception_type_name)\n\n    # Extract the exception value (if needed)\n    print(\"1\", ex_value)\n\n    # Format the traceback\n    formatted_traceback = ''.join(traceback.format_tb(ex_traceback))\n    print(\"2\", \"Traceback (most recent call last):\\n\" + formatted_traceback)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Exception Type Name**: `ex_type.__name__` extracts the name of the exception type (in this case, `NameError`).\n\n2. **Exception Value**: Directly using `ex_value` gives you the message associated with the exception, which is empty in this scenario because `NameError` was raised without a message.\n\n3. **Formatted Traceback**: `traceback.format_tb(ex_traceback)` returns a list of strings representing the traceback. Joining them with `''.join(...)` creates a single formatted string.\n\nThis will give you an output similar to the desired format you provided."
