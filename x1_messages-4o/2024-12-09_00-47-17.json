However, when I attempt to call a kernel function inside another kernel function, I encounter an error.

        "content": "Dynamic parallelism in CUDA allows for the launching of new kernels from within a running kernel, which is a feature supported on devices with a compute capability of 3.5 or higher. Since the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780 does indeed have a compute capability of 3.5, you should be able to use this feature.\n\nHere are some possible reasons and solutions for the error you are encountering:\n\n1. **Compilation Target Architecture**: Ensure that your CUDA code is being compiled for the correct architecture. You need to specify the compute capability of your device when compiling the code. You can do this by adding the compilation flags `-arch=compute_35 -code=sm_35` to the `nvcc` compiler command. This ensures that the code is generated for the architecture that supports dynamic parallelism.\n\n2. **CUDA Toolkit Version**: Double-check that you are using CUDA 5.5 or later, as dynamic parallelism was introduced in this version. If you have multiple versions of CUDA installed, ensure that your build environment is set up to use the correct version.\n\n3. **Driver Version**: Ensure that your NVIDIA driver version supports the CUDA version you are using. Sometimes, older drivers may not fully support newer features of CUDA.\n\n4. **Code Review**: Make sure that your code syntactically supports dynamic parallelism. The kernel you are calling from another kernel should be defined with the `__global__` qualifier, and you should be using the correct syntax for launching kernels from within a kernel.\n\n5. **Project Settings**: If you are using an integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio with the NVIDIA Nsight plugin, make sure the project settings are configured to target the correct GPU architecture.\n\nBy verifying these aspects, you should be able to resolve the issue with dynamic parallelism on your GTX 780. If the problem persists, consider sharing more details about your build setup and code snippets for further assistance."
