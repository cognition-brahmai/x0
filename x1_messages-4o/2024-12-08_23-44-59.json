        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to consider a 5-digit number where each digit can be 1, 2, or 3, none of the digits repeat, and their sum is 12. We want to find the largest possible number John could be thinking of.\n\nFirst, let's identify the possible combinations of 5 different digits (1, 2, or 3) that add up to 12:\n\n1. Since the digits cannot be repeated and can only be 1, 2, or 3, we need to maximize the use of the digit '3' to get the largest possible number.\n\n2. Start with as many '3's as possible:\n   - Four '3's would sum to 12, but we can't use four '3's because the digits must be unique.\n   - Three '3's would sum to 9, which leaves 3 to reach 12. We can use one '2' and one '1' (3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 12).\n\nNow, arrange these digits to form the largest possible number:\n- The largest possible number will have the digits in descending order: 33210.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible number John could be thinking of is 33210."
