        "content": "To develop a script that calls a function named `add`, you first need to define what the function does. Let's assume the `add` function takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum. Here's a simple script in Python to demonstrate this:\n\n```python\n# Define the add function\ndef add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\n# Main script\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Example usage of the add function\n    number1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    number2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\n    result = add(number1, number2)\n    print(f\"The sum of {number1} and {number2} is {result}\")\n```\n\nIn this script:\n\n1. We define the `add` function that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.\n2. We then use a `main` block to prompt the user for two numbers.\n3. The script calls the `add` function with these numbers and prints the result.\n\nYou can run this script in any Python environment to see how it works. If you have a different context or programming language in mind, feel free to specify, and I can provide a tailored solution."
