Can you determine the correct order of information for a person based on the clues given below? \nYou will be given the following clues: \n- The person's favorite color is blue \n- They have a pet dog named Max \n- Their birthday is in August \n- They work as a software engineer \nUsing these clues, you must figure out the correct order of information for this person. Remember, the order should be based on the importance of each piece of information. \nHint: The first piece of information should be their occupation, followed by their birthday, then their pet's name, and finally their favorite color. Good luck! \nAs an experienced puzzle expert, I believe that modifying the clues in the puzzle is a great way to make it more challenging. For example, if we had clues such as their favorite book, their preferred mode of transportation, and their favorite food, we could create a puzzle that is even harder to solve. The key is to choose clues that are not immediately obvious and require some thinking to figure out the correct order."
