For context, I do have a folder named 'flask' in my project directory. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The `ImportError: No module named flask` typically indicates that Python is unable to find the Flask module. This can happen for a few reasons, and I\u2019ll guide you through some potential solutions:\n\n1. **Check Flask Installation:**\n   - First, ensure that Flask is installed in your environment. You can check this by running:\n     ```bash\n     pip show flask\n     ```\n   - If Flask is not installed, you can install it using:\n     ```bash\n     pip install flask\n     ```\n\n2. **Virtual Environment:**\n   - It's a good practice to use a virtual environment for your projects to manage dependencies. Make sure you have activated your virtual environment before running your application.\n   - If you haven't set up a virtual environment, you can do so with:\n     ```bash\n     python3 -m venv venv\n     source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux\n     venv\\Scripts\\activate     # On Windows\n     ```\n   - Then, install Flask within this virtual environment:\n     ```bash\n     pip install flask\n     ```\n\n3. **Python Path:**\n   - Ensure you are using the correct Python interpreter where Flask is installed. If you have multiple Python versions, you might be using the wrong one.\n   - Run the following to see the current Python path:\n     ```bash\n     which python  # On macOS/Linux\n     where python  # On Windows\n     ```\n\n4. **Check for Naming Conflicts:**\n   - Ensure that you don't have a folder named `flask` in your project directory, as it might conflict with the Flask module import. Since you mentioned having a folder named `flask`, it could be causing the issue. Try renaming that folder to something else.\n\n5. **Check PYTHONPATH:**\n   - Make sure your `PYTHONPATH` is set correctly. Sometimes, the issue arises if Python is not looking in the right directory for installed packages. You can print the PYTHONPATH by:\n     ```python\n     import sys\n     print(sys.path)\n     ```\n\n6. **Restart Your Environment:**\n   - After making changes or installing packages, restart your terminal or IDE to ensure changes take effect.\n\nOnce you've gone through these steps, try running your application again. If the issue persists, feel free to provide more details, and I\u2019ll be happy to help further!"
