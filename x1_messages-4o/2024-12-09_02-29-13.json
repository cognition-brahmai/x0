But when I run my code, I receive an error that says `'ImageDataGenerator' object has no attribute 'flow_from_dataframe'`. The code that I'm using is shown below. \n\n```python\ntrain_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255,\n                                   validation_split=0.15\n)\n\ntest_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)\n\ntrain_path = MAIN_DIR + '/CancerTrain'\nvalid_path = MAIN_DIR + '/CancerTrain'\n\ntrain_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_dataframe(\n                dataframe = train_labels,\n                directory=train_path,\n                x_col = 'id',\n                y_col = 'label',\n                has_ext=False,\n                subset='training',\n                target_size=(96, 96),\n                batch_size=64,\n                class_mode='binary'\n                )\n\nvalidation_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_dataframe(\n                dataframe=df,\n                directory=valid_path,\n                x_col = 'id',\n                y_col = 'label',\n                has_ext=False,\n                subset='validation',\n                target_size=(96, 96),\n                batch_size=64,\n                shuffle=False,\n                class_mode='binary'\n                )\n```\nHere is the error message:\n\n```python\nAttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)\n&lt;ipython-input-22-eb9c70d0ad1c&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()\n     15                                                    )\n     16 \n---&gt; 17 train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_dataframe(\n     18                 dataframe = train_labels,\n     19                 directory=train_path,\n\nAttributeError: 'ImageDataGenerator' object has no attribute 'flow_from_dataframe'\n```\n\nI can't seem to find a solution. Is the method `flow_from_dataframe` called differently now?"

        "content": "The `flow_from_dataframe` method is part of the `tf.keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator` class in TensorFlow, but it might not be available in older versions or different environments. Here are a few things you can check or do to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Proper Import**: Make sure you have imported the correct `ImageDataGenerator` class from TensorFlow Keras. It should look like this:\n\n   ```python\n   from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator\n   ```\n\n2. **TensorFlow Version**: The `flow_from_dataframe` method was introduced in later versions of TensorFlow. Make sure you are using TensorFlow 2.x. You can check your TensorFlow version by running:\n\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n   print(tf.__version__)\n   ```\n\n   If your version is below 2.x, consider upgrading TensorFlow:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade tensorflow\n   ```\n\n3. **Use Correct Method**: If you are using an older version of TensorFlow and cannot upgrade, you might want to use `flow_from_directory` instead if your images are organized in a directory structure. Otherwise, upgrading TensorFlow is the best solution to access `flow_from_dataframe`.\n\n4. **Alternative Libraries**: If upgrading is not an option, consider using other libraries such as `torchvision` from PyTorch, which provides similar functionality for data loading and augmentation.\n\n5. **Check DataFrame**: Ensure that your DataFrame (`train_labels` and `df`) is correctly formatted and contains the necessary columns specified in `x_col` and `y_col`.\n\nBy ensuring you have the right version and imports, and your data is correctly structured, you should be able to resolve the error."
