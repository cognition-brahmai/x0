        "content": "In Python 2, the `>>` syntax in the `print` statement is used to redirect the output of the `print` function to a different stream than the default, which is `sys.stdout`. In the code snippet you provided:\n\n```python\nprint >> sys.stderr, \"Error in atexit._run_exitfuncs:\"\n```\n\nThe `>>` operator is directing the output of the `print` statement to `sys.stderr` instead of the usual `sys.stdout`. This is useful for printing error messages or logging information to `stderr`, which is typically used for error messages and diagnostics, while `stdout` is used for regular program output.\n\nIn Python 3, this syntax has been replaced with the `file` parameter in the `print` function, and you would write it like this:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Error in atexit._run_exitfuncs:\", file=sys.stderr)\n```\n\nThis approach is more explicit and clear, aligning with Python 3's emphasis on clarity and readability."
