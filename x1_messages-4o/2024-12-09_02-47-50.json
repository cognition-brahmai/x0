        "content": "Certainly! In NumPy, you can determine if an array is multidimensional by checking the number of dimensions it has using the `.ndim` attribute. An array is considered multidimensional if it has more than one dimension.\n\nHere's how you can check if your array `V` is multidimensional:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nV = np.array([\n    [-7.94627203e+01, -1.81562235e+02, -3.05418070e+02, -2.38451033e+02],\n    [9.43740653e+01, 1.69312771e+02, 1.68545575e+01, -1.44450299e+02],\n    [5.61599000e+00, 8.76135909e+01, 1.18959245e+02, -1.44049237e+02]\n])\n\n# Check the number of dimensions\nif V.ndim > 1:\n    print(\"The array is multidimensional.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The array is not multidimensional.\")\n```\n\nFor your array `V`, it should output \"The array is multidimensional\" since `V` has 2 dimensions (it's a 3x4 array)."
