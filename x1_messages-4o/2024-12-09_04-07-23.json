        "content": "Certainly! In Flask, you can easily access HTTP headers from a request using the `request` object provided by Flask. To access the authorization header, you can use the `request.headers` attribute. Here is a simple example to demonstrate how you can retrieve and print the `Authorization` header from incoming requests:\n\nFirst, make sure you have Flask installed. If not, you can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install flask\n```\n\nThen, you can create a simple Flask application as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/your-endpoint', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef your_endpoint():\n    # Retrieve the Authorization header\n    auth_header = request.headers.get('Authorization')\n    \n    # Check if the Authorization header is present\n    if auth_header:\n        return f\"Authorization Header: {auth_header}\", 200\n    else:\n        return \"Authorization Header not found\", 400\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Import Flask and Request**: First, you import the necessary modules from Flask.\n- **Create a Flask App**: Instantiate the Flask app with `Flask(__name__)`.\n- **Define a Route**: Use the `@app.route` decorator to define an endpoint (e.g., `/your-endpoint`) and specify the methods it will handle (GET, POST, etc.).\n- **Access Headers**: Within the view function (`your_endpoint`), use `request.headers.get('Authorization')` to retrieve the value of the `Authorization` header.\n- **Return Response**: You can then return the header or an appropriate response based on whether the header is found.\n\n### Running the Application:\n- Save the code in a file, say `app.py`.\n- Run the application using the command `python app.py`.\n- The server will start, and you can test it by sending requests to `http://localhost:5000/your-endpoint` with an `Authorization` header using a tool like Postman or `curl`.\n\nThis should help you monitor the `Authorization` header in your Flask application!"
