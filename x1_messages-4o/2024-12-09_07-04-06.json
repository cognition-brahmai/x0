        "content": "To add a `timedelta` of one hour to the current time in Python, you need to ensure you're working with the correct objects. The `time()` function returns the current time as a floating-point number representing seconds since the epoch, while `timedelta` works with `datetime` objects. Here's how you can do it using the `datetime` module:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Get the current date and time\ncurrent_time = datetime.now()\n\n# Add a timedelta of one hour\nnew_time = current_time + timedelta(hours=1)\n\nprint(\"Current Time:\", current_time)\nprint(\"New Time after adding one hour:\", new_time)\n```\n\nIn this code, `datetime.now()` gives you the current date and time as a `datetime` object. You can then add a `timedelta` to it directly to get the new time."
