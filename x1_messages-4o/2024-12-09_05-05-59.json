However, it seems that Google Colab GPU's doesn't come pre-installed with CUDA Toolkit. While trying to install mxnet in Google Colab, I encountered an error. The error message suggested to uninstall mxnet and install mxnet-cu90 version 1.1.0, adjusting 'cu90' depending on your CUDA version. It also mentioned an option to disable GPU usage altogether by invoking turicreate.config.set_num_gpus(0). The error message is as follows:\n\n```python\nInstalling collected packages: mxnet\nSuccessfully installed mxnet-1.2.0\n\nERROR: Incomplete installation for leveraging GPUs for computations. Please make sure you have CUDA installed and run the following line in your terminal and try again:\n\npip uninstall -y mxnet && pip install mxnet-cu90==1.1.0\n\nAdjust 'cu90' depending on your CUDA version ('cu75' and 'cu80' are also available). You can also disable GPU usage altogether by invoking turicreate.config.set_num_gpus(0). An exception has occurred, use %tb to see the full traceback.\n\nSystemExit: 1\n```\nHow can I resolve this issue and successfully install CUDA in Google Colab GPU's?"

        "content": "To resolve the issue and successfully install CUDA in Google Colab GPUs, you need to ensure that the appropriate version of CUDA is installed and that the correct version of `mxnet` for that CUDA version is used. Google Colab typically comes with CUDA pre-installed alongside its compatible drivers, but sometimes specific libraries require a particular version.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to help you resolve this:\n\n1. **Check the Current CUDA Version:**\n   First, verify which version of CUDA is currently available in your Google Colab environment.\n\n   ```python\n   !nvcc --version\n   ```\n\n2. **Install the Correct Version of mxnet:**\n   Once you have determined the CUDA version (e.g., CUDA 10.1, CUDA 11.0, etc.), you can select the correct `mxnet` version. For example, if the CUDA version is 10.1, you might need `mxnet-cu101`.\n\n   ```python\n   # Uninstall any existing mxnet version\n   !pip uninstall -y mxnet\n\n   # Install the correct version of mxnet for your CUDA version\n   !pip install mxnet-cu101==1.1.0  # Replace 'cu101' with your CUDA version\n   ```\n\n3. **Restart the Runtime:**\n   After installing the correct version of `mxnet`, restart the runtime to ensure all changes are applied. You can do this by clicking on `Runtime` > `Restart runtime` in the Colab menu.\n\n4. **Verify Installation:**\n   After restarting the runtime, you can verify if `mxnet` is correctly installed and utilizing the GPU:\n\n   ```python\n   import mxnet as mx\n   print(mx.context.num_gpus())  # This should return the number of GPUs available\n   ```\n\n5. **Disable GPU Usage (Optional):**\n   If you decide not to use the GPU or encounter further issues, you can disable GPU usage.\n\n   ```python\n   import turicreate\n   turicreate.config.set_num_gpus(0)\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the CUDA and `mxnet` installation issues in Google Colab and make use of GPU acceleration for your computations."
