Here's my current attempt:\n\n```python\nproduct_obj = products.all()[0] #here products is service name\nproduct_obj.product_uid = 'something' #here product_uid is the pk of product model\nproducts.save(product_obj)\n```\nHowever, this just updates the old object instead of creating a new one. My `products.save` function is defined as follows:\n\n```python\nclass Service(object):\n    __model__ = None\n    def save(self, model):\n        self._isinstance(model)\n        db.session.add(model)\n        db.session.commit()\n        return model\n```"

        "content": "To clone an object in SQLAlchemy and save it with a new primary key, you need to create a new instance of the model with the same attributes as the original object, except for the primary key. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n1. **Create a new instance of the model** by copying the attributes from the original object.\n2. **Assign a new primary key** to this new instance.\n3. **Save the new instance** using your `save` method.\n\nHere's an updated version of your code that demonstrates this process:\n\n```python\nfrom copy import deepcopy\n\n# Assuming `Product` is your model class\nproduct_obj = products.all()[0]\n\n# Create a deep copy of the product object\nnew_product_obj = deepcopy(product_obj)\n\n# Assign a new primary key value\nnew_product_obj.product_uid = 'new_unique_value'  # or some unique value generator\n\n# Remove the old primary key to ensure a new instance is created\ndelattr(new_product_obj, 'id')  # Assuming 'id' is the primary key attribute name\n\n# Save the new object\nproducts.save(new_product_obj)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Deep Copy**: Use `deepcopy` to create a new instance of the object with the same attribute values. This ensures that no references to the original object are maintained.\n- **Primary Key Assignment**: Make sure to assign a new, unique primary key value. If your database is set to auto-generate primary keys (like an auto-increment integer), you might not need to explicitly set it, but you should ensure it's not set to the old primary key.\n- **Remove Existing Primary Key**: If your primary key is auto-incremented, remove it from the new instance by using `delattr`. This allows the database to assign a new value upon insertion.\n\nThis approach ensures that the new object is treated as a separate entity and is inserted as a new row in the database rather than updating the existing one."
