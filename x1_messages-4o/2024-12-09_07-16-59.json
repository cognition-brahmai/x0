However, when I use the command `pip install MySQL_python==1.2.2`, it still shows `MySQL_python-1.2.3-py2.6.egg-info` in the site packages. Is there a specific issue with the `MySQL_python` package that is causing this or am I doing something wrong?"

        "content": "It seems like you're encountering an issue where the specific version of the `MySQL_python` package you want isn't being installed as expected. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and ensure that the correct version is installed:\n\n1. **Verify Virtual Environment**: Make sure you have activated the correct virtual environment before installing the package. You can activate it using:\n   - On Windows: `.\\env\\Scripts\\activate`\n   - On macOS/Linux: `source env/bin/activate`\n\n2. **Check Existing Installations**: Ensure that there are no existing installations of `MySQL_python` in your virtual environment that might conflict with the version you're trying to install. You can list installed packages with:\n   ```bash\n   pip list\n   ```\n\n3. **Clear Cache**: Sometimes, cached versions might cause issues. Clear the cache using:\n   ```bash\n   pip cache purge\n   ```\n\n4. **Specify the Python Version**: Make sure that your virtual environment is using the correct Python version that is compatible with `MySQL_python==1.2.2`. This package is quite old and may not be compatible with newer Python versions.\n\n5. **Use a Specific Index URL**: If the package version is not available on the default PyPI index, you might need to specify a different index or repository where the package version is available.\n\n6. **Direct Download and Install**: If the version is still not being installed, try downloading the specific version directly and installing it from the local file:\n   ```bash\n   pip install /path/to/MySQL_python-1.2.2.tar.gz\n   ```\n\n7. **Check for Errors**: Look at the output of the `pip install` command for any errors or warnings that might indicate why the version isn't being installed.\n\nIf you follow these steps and still encounter issues, there might be a problem with the availability of version `1.2.2` on the package index or compatibility issues with your environment setup. In such cases, consider exploring alternative MySQL connectors like `mysqlclient`, which is a fork of `MySQL_python` and might offer better compatibility with modern environments."
