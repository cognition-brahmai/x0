Here is a simple example in Python:\n\n```python\n# Prompt the user to enter the first number\na = float(input(\"Enter the first number (a): \"))\n\n# Prompt the user to enter the second number\nb = float(input(\"Enter the second number (b): \"))\n\n# Calculate the sum of the two numbers\nsum_of_two = a + b\n\n# Print the sum\nprint(\"The sum of\", a, \"and\", b, \"is:\", sum_of_two)\n```\n\nThis code will take two numbers as input from the user, calculate their sum, and print the result. The `float()` function is used to convert the input from a string to a floating-point number, allowing for decimal inputs. If you want to restrict the inputs to integers, you can use `int()` instead of `float()`."
