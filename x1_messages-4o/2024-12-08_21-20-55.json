        "content": "Certainly! Here are three plants that thrive in full sun and can be grown in pots:\n\n1. **Geraniums (Pelargonium)**: Geraniums are popular for their vibrant blooms and come in a variety of colors. They thrive in full sun and require well-drained soil. Regular deadheading will encourage continuous flowering.\n\n2. **Lavender (Lavandula)**: Known for its fragrant flowers and foliage, lavender is an excellent choice for sunny spots. It prefers well-draining soil and minimal watering once established. Lavender is not only beautiful but also attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies.\n\n3. **Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis)**: This aromatic herb is perfect for sunny locations and can be used both for culinary purposes and ornamental value. Rosemary requires well-drained soil and minimal watering. It also makes a great addition to any sunny patio or balcony garden.\n\nThese plants are not only beautiful but also relatively easy to care for, making them ideal for container gardening in sunny locations."
