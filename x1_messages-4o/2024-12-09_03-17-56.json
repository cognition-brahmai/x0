The method I am currently using involves finding everything marked as a person, and then generating a list of all the proper nouns (NNP) associated with that person.

        "content": "Extracting human names from text can be challenging, especially when dealing with edge cases like company names or other non-person entities. Your approach is on the right track, but you can enhance it by incorporating some additional logic and tools. Here are some suggestions to improve your current method:\n\n1. **Entity Recognition with SpaCy**: Consider using SpaCy, a powerful NLP library that provides more robust named entity recognition (NER) capabilities. SpaCy can differentiate between various types of named entities, such as organizations, locations, and people, which can help filter out false positives like \"Virgin Galactic.\"\n\n2. **Contextual Filtering**: Implement a context-based filtering mechanism. For example, you can build a list of common organization or company names and cross-reference extracted names against this list. This can help in identifying and excluding non-person entities.\n\n3. **Leverage Pre-trained Models**: Use pre-trained models with better NER accuracy. Models trained on large corpora are more likely to correctly identify and classify names.\n\n4. **Post-processing with Heuristics**: Introduce heuristics for post-processing NER results. For instance, if a detected \"PERSON\" entity is followed by words like \"Inc.\", \"Ltd.\", \"Corp.\", etc., it may not be a person.\n\n5. **Enhance with Additional Data**: Integrate a database of known human names to cross-verify detected entities. This can help confirm whether a detected entity is more likely to be a person.\n\nHere's a sample of how you might use SpaCy to improve your process:\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom nameparser.parser import HumanName\n\ndef get_human_names_spacy(text):\n    nlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n    doc = nlp(text)\n    person_list = []\n\n    for ent in doc.ents:\n        if ent.label_ == \"PERSON\":\n            name = ent.text\n            if name not in person_list:\n                person_list.append(name)\n    \n    return person_list\n\ntext = \"\"\"\nSome economists have responded positively to Bitcoin, including \nFrancois R.
