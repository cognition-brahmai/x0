        "content": "CUDA Fortran is a proprietary extension of the Fortran programming language for CUDA-enabled GPUs, primarily supported by NVIDIA's PGI (now part of NVIDIA's HPC SDK). As of my last update, there isn't a completely free, non-trial version of a CUDA Fortran compiler available. This is primarily because CUDA Fortran is a specialized tool that requires significant resources to develop and maintain.\n\nHowever, here are some suggestions you might consider:\n\n1. **Educational Licenses:** If you are affiliated with an educational institution, you might be able to obtain a free or discounted license through your school or university.\n\n2. **Open Source Alternatives:** While not CUDA Fortran, you might explore open-source alternatives for parallel computing with Fortran, such as OpenMP or MPI, which can be used with free compilers like GNU Fortran (gfortran). These do not provide CUDA capabilities but can be used for parallel computing on CPUs.\n\n3. **NVIDIA HPC SDK:** NVIDIA provides the HPC SDK, which includes a range of compilers and libraries for Fortran, C, and C++ targeted at CUDA and other HPC applications. While it includes trial versions, checking for any free offerings or community editions may be worthwhile.\n\n4. **Community and Forums:** Engaging with developer forums or communities might provide leads on academic partnerships, community-maintained versions, or other resources that could be useful.\n\nIf CUDA Fortran is a strict requirement, you might need to consider budget allocations for the PGI compiler, or explore whether your organization can provide access through shared licenses."
