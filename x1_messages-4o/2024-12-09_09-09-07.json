Below is a step-by-step guide to creating this web service.\n\n1. **Set Up Your Go Environment:**\n   Make sure you have Go installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).\n\n2. **Create a New Go File:**\n   Create a new directory for your project and a Go file within it, for example, `concat_service.go`.\n\n3. **Write the Code:**\n   Here's a sample code for your web service:\n\n   ```go\n   package main\n\n   import (\n       \"fmt\"\n       \"net/http\"\n   )\n\n   // handler function to process incoming requests\n   func concatHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n       // Parse query parameters\n       query := r.URL.Query()\n       str1 := query.Get(\"str1\")\n       str2 := query.Get(\"str2\")\n\n       // Concatenate the strings\n       result := str1 + str2\n\n       // Respond with the result\n       fmt.Fprintf(w, \"Concatenated Result: %s\", result)\n   }\n\n   func main() {\n       // Register the handler function for the /concat endpoint\n       http.HandleFunc(\"/concat\", concatHandler)\n\n       // Start the server on port 8080\n       fmt.Println(\"Server is listening on port 8080...\")\n       if err := http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", nil); err != nil {\n           fmt.Println(\"Failed to start server:\", err)\n           return\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Run the Web Service:**\n   Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing your `concat_service.go` file, and run the following command:\n\n   ```sh\n   go run concat_service.go\n   ```\n\n   This will start the web server on `localhost` at port `8080`.\n\n5. **Test the Web Service:**\n   You can test the web service by opening a web browser or using a tool like `curl` or Postman. For example, you can use the following URL in your browser:\n\n   ```\n   http://localhost:8080/concat?str1=Hello&str2=World\n   ```\n\n   This should return:\n\n   ```\n   Concatenated Result: HelloWorld\n   ```\n\nAnd that's it! You've created a simple web service in Go that concatenates two strings provided as query parameters."
