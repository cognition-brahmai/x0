        "content": "To optimize the Python code for calculating the total price of a purchase using the given JSON data, we can focus on clarity and efficiency, ensuring that the code is concise and easy to read. Here\u2019s an optimized version of the code:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Assuming the JSON data is stored as a string\ndata = '''\n{\n  \"fruits\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"banana\",\n      \"price\": 1.00,\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"kiwi\",\n      \"price\": 2.00,\n      \"quantity\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"mango\",\n      \"price\": 3.50,\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n'''\n\n# Parse the JSON data\nfruits_data = json.loads(data)\n\n# Calculate the total price using a generator expression\ntotal_price = sum(fruit['price'] * fruit['quantity'] for fruit in fruits_data['fruits'])\n\nprint(f\"Total price of purchase: ${total_price:.2f}\")\n```\n\n### Key Points of Optimization:\n\n1. **Use of `json.loads`:** This function is used to parse the JSON string into a Python dictionary, making it easy to access the data.\n\n2. **Generator Expression:** The use of a generator expression within `sum()` is both memory-efficient and concise, as it calculates the total price in a single line.\n\n3. **String Formatting:** The `print` statement uses formatted string literals for clarity and ensures that the total price is displayed with two decimal places.\n\nThis code is efficient for small to moderately sized JSON data and is easy to understand and maintain."
