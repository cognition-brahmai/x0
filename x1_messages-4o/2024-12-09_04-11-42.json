When I try to install PIL using \"pip install pil\", I get a message saying \"Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement pil (from versions: ) No matching distribution found for pil\". When I try to install Pillow using \"pip install Pillow\", I get an error during installation and it aborts. The error message says \"zlib is required unless explicitly disabled using --disable-zlib, aborting\". I tried to use the argument \"--disable-zlib\" with pip install, but \"pip install Pillow --disable-zlib\" wasn't correct. I also tried to find a version that matches my system on the Pillow page on PyPI, but couldn't find one."

        "content": "To install Pillow on Python 3.6 on a 64-bit Windows 10 system, you can follow these steps. It seems like the main issue you're encountering is related to the zlib dependency. This can typically be resolved by ensuring that all necessary build tools and libraries are available for Pillow to compile properly.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to help you:\n\n1. **Update pip**: First, ensure that your pip is updated to the latest version. Open a command prompt and run:\n   ```bash\n   python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n   ```\n\n2. **Install prerequisites**: Pillow requires some external libraries to be installed before it can work correctly. On Windows, the easiest way to get these libraries is through a package called `pillow-wheels` which includes precompiled binaries.\n\n3. **Use pillow-wheels**:\n   - Go to the [Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pillow) page.\n   - Find the version of Pillow that matches your Python version and system architecture (e.g., `Pillow\u20118.0.1\u2011cp36\u2011cp36m\u2011win_amd64.whl` for 64-bit Python 3.6).\n   - Download the appropriate `.whl` file to your computer.\n\n4. **Install the downloaded wheel**:\n   - Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the `.whl` file using the command prompt.\n   - Run the following command to install Pillow using the wheel file:\n     ```bash\n     pip install Pillow\u20118.0.1\u2011cp36\u2011cp36m\u2011win_amd64.whl\n     ```\n   - Make sure to replace `Pillow\u20118.0.1\u2011cp36\u2011cp36m\u2011win_amd64.whl` with the exact name of the file you downloaded.\n\n5. **Verify installation**:\n   - After installation, you can verify that Pillow is installed correctly by running:\n     ```bash\n     python -c \"from PIL import Image; print(Image.__version__)\"\n     ```\n   - This should print the version of Pillow, confirming that it is installed and working.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to install Pillow without encountering the zlib error. If you still face issues, check that your Python environment is correctly configured and all necessary tools are installed."
