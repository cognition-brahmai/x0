        "content": "To generate a list of words that are similar in category to \"refrigerator\" and \"oven,\" you can use a pre-trained word embeddings model like Word2Vec or GloVe. These models can help find words that are semantically similar or belong to the same category. Here's how you can do it using the `gensim` library in Python, which provides an implementation of Word2Vec:\n\nFirst, ensure you have the `gensim` library installed:\n\n```bash\npip install gensim\n```\n\nThen, you can use the following Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom gensim.models import KeyedVectors\n\n# Load the pre-trained Word2Vec model. This example uses Google's pre-trained model.\n# You can download the model from: https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/\nmodel_path = 'path/to/GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin'\nmodel = KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format(model_path, binary=True)\n\n# Find words similar to \"refrigerator\" and \"oven\"\nsimilar_words = model.most_similar(positive=['refrigerator', 'oven'], topn=10)\n\n# Print the list of similar words\nfor word, similarity in similar_words:\n    print(word)\n```\n\nIn this code, you load a pre-trained Word2Vec model and find the top 10 words similar to \"refrigerator\" and \"oven.\" You can adjust the `topn` parameter to get more or fewer suggestions. The model used here is Google's pre-trained model, which is quite large and may require substantial memory and processing power.\n\nAlternatively, you can explore and use smaller models or other libraries like `spacy` that provide pre-trained vectors with similar functionality."
