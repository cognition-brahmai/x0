        "content": "To write a program that calculates the complement of a given binary number, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Concept**: The complement of a binary number is obtained by flipping all the bits (0s to 1s and 1s to 0s).\n\n2. **Choose a Programming Language**: You can choose any programming language you are comfortable with. I'll provide an example in Python, which is quite straightforward for such tasks.\n\n3. **Write the Program**:\n\nHere's a simple Python program to calculate the complement of a given binary number:\n\n```python\ndef binary_complement(binary_str):\n    # Ensure the input is a binary string\n    if not all(bit in '01' for bit in binary_str):\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a binary string\")\n\n    # Calculate complement\n    complement = ''.join('1' if bit == '0' else '0' for bit in binary_str)\n    return complement\n\n# Example usage\nbinary_number = input(\"Enter a binary number: \")\ntry:\n    complement = binary_complement(binary_number)\n    print(f\"The complement of {binary_number} is {complement}\")\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(e)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Input Validation**: The program first checks if the input string is a valid binary number (i.e., contains only '0' and '1').\n\n- **Complement Calculation**: It iterates over each bit in the binary string. If the bit is '0', it changes it to '1', and if it's '1', it changes it to '0'.\n\n- **Output**: The program prints the complement of the given binary number.\n\n### Test the Program:\n\n- Run the program and enter a binary number like `1010`.\n- The program should output `0101`, which is the complement of `1010`.\n\nYou can adapt this code to other programming languages by using similar logic for input validation and bit manipulation."
