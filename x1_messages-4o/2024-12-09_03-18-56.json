However, I don't get this error when I copy and paste the code in interactive mode with python.exe. I am using Python 2.6.6. Why is this happening and how can I solve it?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that there might be a conflict with the `logging` module in your environment. Here are a few steps to help you troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check for Module Name Conflicts:**\n   - Ensure that you don't have a file named `logging.py` in the same directory as your script. If such a file exists, it could be shadowing the standard library's `logging` module.\n\n2. **Check for `logging.pyc` Files:**\n   - Look for any `logging.pyc` files in your directory. These are compiled Python files that may have been generated if there was a `logging.py` file at some point. Delete any `logging.pyc` files to avoid conflicts.\n\n3. **Verify Your Python Environment:**\n   - Ensure that your Python environment is correctly set up and that you are not using a modified version of the standard library. Sometimes, custom Python distributions might have issues.\n\n4. **Update Python (if possible):**\n   - Python 2.6.6 is quite old and has been out of support for a long time. If it's possible to upgrade to a newer version of Python, consider doing so. Newer versions of Python come with numerous improvements and bug fixes.\n\n5. **Use Alternative Logging Configuration (if necessary):**\n   - While the `basicConfig` method should work, if the issue persists, you can try configuring the logger directly as an alternative:\n\n   ```python\n   import logging\n\n   logger = logging.getLogger()\n   logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\n   fh = logging.FileHandler('example.log')\n   fh.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\n   formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n   fh.setFormatter(formatter)\n\n   logger.addHandler(fh)\n\n   logger.debug('This message should go to the log file')\n   ```\n\n6. **Create a Virtual Environment:**\n   - Consider creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies and ensure that your script runs with the default `logging` module provided by Python's standard library.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully run your Python script with logging enabled."
