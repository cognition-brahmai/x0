        "content": "To retrieve such data using Swift, you would typically need a backend API or a database where this customer and order information is stored. Assuming you have access to a RESTful API or a database, I'll outline a general approach to achieve this. Here, I'll use a hypothetical API endpoint and show you how you might structure your Swift code to fetch and process this data.\n\n### Step 1: Setup Networking in Swift\n\nYou will need to use URLSession to make network requests. You might also use a library like Alamofire to simplify this process.\n\n### Step 2: Define Your Data Models\n\nYou'll need to create Swift structs to model the data you're working with. Assuming a simple JSON response, it might look like this:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nstruct Customer: Codable {\n    let name: String\n    let address: String\n    let totalAmountSpent: Double\n}\n\nstruct Order: Codable {\n    let customer: Customer\n    let orderDate: Date\n    let amount: Double\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Create a Function to Fetch Data\n\nAssuming you have an endpoint like `https://api.yourserver.com/orders`, you can fetch the data as follows:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nfunc fetchRecentOrders(completion: @escaping ([Customer]?, Error?) -> Void) {\n    guard let url = URL(string: \"https://api.yourserver.com/orders\") else {\n        completion(nil, NSError(domain: \"\", code: 0, userInfo: [NSLocalizedDescriptionKey: \"Invalid URL\"]))\n        return\n    }\n\n    let dateFormatter = ISO8601DateFormatter()\n    let threeMonthsAgo = Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .month, value: -3, to: Date())!\n    let dateString = dateFormatter.string(from: threeMonthsAgo)\n\n    var urlComponents = URLComponents(url: url, resolvingAgainstBaseURL: false)!\n    urlComponents.queryItems = [\n        URLQueryItem(name: \"city\", value: \"SouthwestCity\"), // Replace with actual city name\n        URLQueryItem(name: \"fromDate\", value: dateString)\n    ]\n\n    var request = URLRequest(url: urlComponents.url!)\n    request.httpMethod = \"GET\"\n\n    let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request) { data, response, error in\n        if let error = error {\n            completion(nil, error)\n            return\n        }\n\n        guard let data = data else {\n            completion(nil, NSError(domain: \"\", code: 0, userInfo: [NSLocalizedDescriptionKey: \"No data received\"]))\n            return\n        }\n\n        do {\n            let orders = try JSONDecoder().decode([Order].self, from: data)\n            let customers = orders.map { $0.customer }\n            completion(customers, nil)\n        } catch {\n            completion(nil, error)\n        }\n    }\n\n    task.resume()\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Use the Function\n\nCall this function wherever you need to fetch the data and handle the results:\n\n```swift\nfetchRecentOrders { customers, error in\n    if let error = error {\n        print(\"Error fetching orders: \\(error.localizedDescription)\")\n    } else if let customers = customers {\n        for customer in customers {\n            print(\"Customer Name: \\(customer.name)\")\n            print(\"Address: \\(customer.address)\")\n            print(\"Total Amount Spent: \\(customer.totalAmountSpent)\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Considerations\n\n- **Date Handling**: The code uses `Calendar` and `Date` to calculate the date three months ago, ensuring it works with the current date.\n- **Error Handling**: Ensure robust error handling for network and parsing errors.\n- **Data Security**: Ensure secure data transmission using HTTPS and handle sensitive information appropriately.\n\nThis is a simplified example to get you started. You will need to adapt it to the specifics of your API and data structures."
