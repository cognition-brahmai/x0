        "content": "To achieve this, you can implement an insertion method that manually finds the correct position for the new item in the sorted list. Here's a step-by-step guide and a sample implementation:\n\n1. **Iterate through the list**: Start from the beginning of the list and move forward until you find an element that is greater than the new item or reach the end of the list.\n\n2. **Determine the insertion point**: The first position where the current list element is greater than the new item is your insertion point.\n\n3. **Insert the new item**: Create a new list by concatenating the part of the list before the insertion point, the new item, and the part of the list after the insertion point.\n\nHere's the implementation of this logic:\n\n```python\ndef insert_into_sorted_list(sorted_list, new_item):\n    # Iterate over the list to find the correct insertion point\n    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):\n        if sorted_list[i] > new_item:\n            # Found the position where new_item should be inserted\n            return sorted_list[:i] + [new_item] + sorted_list[i:]\n    \n    # If new_item is greater than all elements, append it at the end\n    return sorted_list + [new_item]\n\n# Example usage:\nsorted_list = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\nnew_item = 6\nnew_sorted_list = insert_into_sorted_list(sorted_list, new_item)\nprint(new_sorted_list)  # Output: [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Iteration**: We loop through each element of the `sorted_list` to find the correct position for `new_item`.\n- **Comparison**: If the current element is greater than `new_item`, we have found the insertion point.\n- **Concatenation**: We return the new list formed by concatenating the slice of the list before the insertion point, `[new_item]`, and the slice of the list from the insertion point onwards.\n- **Appending**: If `new_item` is greater than all existing elements, it is simply added to the end of the list.\n\nThis approach efficiently maintains the sorted order of the list using only the allowed operations."
