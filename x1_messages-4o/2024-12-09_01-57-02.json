What am I missing here?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to the scope of the database session in SQLAlchemy. When you close the session using `session.close()` in the `get_list` function, the objects retrieved from the database become detached from the session. This detachment leads to the `UnboundExecutionError` because SQLAlchemy cannot refresh or lazy-load any further data for those objects once the session is closed.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Eager Loading**: Ensure that all the necessary data is loaded before closing the session. This can be done by using eager loading techniques such as `joinedload` or `subqueryload` if your objects have relationships that need to be accessed later.\n\n2. **Detach Objects Properly**: You can manually detach the objects from the session before closing it. This way, the objects are no longer bound to the session, and you won't encounter the `UnboundExecutionError`.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify the `get_list` function:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import joinedload\n\ndef get_list(obj):\n    session = Session()\n    try:\n        # Use joinedload or other loading strategies if needed\n        lst = session.query(MyClass).options(joinedload(MyClass.some_relationship)).all()\n        \n        # Detach objects from the session\n        for item in lst:\n            session.expunge(item)\n        \n        return lst\n    finally:\n        session.close()\n```\n\n3. **Using a Context Manager**: If you want to ensure that the session is properly closed, consider using a context manager to handle the session lifecycle automatically:\n\n```python\nfrom contextlib import contextmanager\n\n@contextmanager\ndef get_session():\n    session = Session()\n    try:\n        yield session\n    finally:\n        session.close()\n\ndef get_list(obj):\n    with get_session() as session:\n        lst = session.query(MyClass).options(joinedload(MyClass.some_relationship)).all()\n        for item in lst:\n            session.expunge(item)\n        return lst\n```\n\nBy using these techniques, you can safely pass the objects to another process without worrying about session-related errors."
