        "content": "When you see \"Not Trusted\" in a Jupyter notebook, it means that the notebook has not been marked as trusted by Jupyter. This is a security feature to prevent the execution of potentially harmful code from untrusted sources. When a notebook is marked as \"Not Trusted,\" certain features like JavaScript and HTML outputs are disabled until the notebook is trusted.\n\nHere\u2019s what you can do to resolve this:\n\n1. **Trust the Notebook:**\n   - Open the Jupyter notebook.\n   - Navigate to the menu bar at the top, click on \"File,\" then select \"Trust Notebook.\"\n   - This action will mark the notebook as trusted, and it will allow all cells to execute normally.\n\n2. **Understanding the Implications:**\n   - Trusting a notebook means you are confident that the code and outputs are safe to run. Be cautious when trusting notebooks from unknown or unverified sources, as they could contain malicious code.\n\n3. **Automatic Trust:**\n   - If you create a new notebook or modify it on your local machine, it should automatically be trusted. If you are opening a notebook from an external source, Jupyter will mark it as \"Not Trusted\" by default.\n\nBy trusting the notebook, you should be able to execute all cells and see all outputs as intended. If you work with notebooks from others frequently, it's good practice to review the code before trusting it."
