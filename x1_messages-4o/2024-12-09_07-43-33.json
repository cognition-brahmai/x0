        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering is likely due to non-unique index values in one or both of your dataframes. When using `pd.concat` with `axis=1`, Pandas attempts to align the dataframes based on their index. If the index is not unique, Pandas cannot perform this alignment, resulting in an `InvalidIndexError`.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to ensure that both dataframes have unique index values. Here's how you can fix the issue:\n\n1. **Check for Duplicate Index Values**: First, verify if there are any duplicate index values in either dataframe. You can do this by checking the index with `df.index.duplicated()`. If there are duplicates, you need to decide how to handle them (e.g., by aggregating, dropping duplicates, or resetting the index).\n\n2. **Reset Index**: If you don't specifically need the current index values, consider resetting the index for both dataframes. This will create a new integer index for both dataframes, allowing them to be concatenated without any conflicts:\n   ```python\n   df1_reset = df1.reset_index(drop=True)\n   df2_reset = df2.reset_index(drop=True)\n   data = pd.concat([df1_reset, df2_reset], axis=1)\n   ```\n\n3. **Reindex with Interpolation**: If you want to maintain the timestamp index and align the dataframes based on timestamps, you can reindex one dataframe to match the index of the other, using interpolation or forward/backward filling for missing values. Here's an example using reindexing:\n   ```python\n   df2_reindexed = df2.reindex(df1.index, method='nearest')  # Use appropriate method for your data\n   data = pd.concat([df1, df2_reindexed], axis=1)\n   ```\n\n4. **Inspect the Data**: Before making any changes, it's a good idea to inspect the index of each dataframe to understand what might be causing the issue:\n   ```python\n   print(df1.index)\n   print(df2.index)\n   ```\n\nIf you still encounter issues after trying these solutions, please ensure that both dataframes are correctly formatted and that any necessary data preprocessing (such as handling missing values or duplicates) has been done."
