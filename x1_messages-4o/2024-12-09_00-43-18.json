For example, node 26 should be 'short.com/z', node 1 should be 'short.com/a', node 52 should be 'short.com/Z', and node 104 should be 'short.com/ZZ'. I need a way to reverse the process when a user goes to that URL. Can anyone suggest a better way to do this?"

        "content": "Creating a URL shortener using a custom encoding system involves converting an integer to a base-62 representation and vice versa. Base-62 is chosen because it uses a combination of 26 lowercase letters, 26 uppercase letters, and 10 digits (0-9), making a total of 62 characters. This allows for a compact representation of numbers, ideal for shortening URLs.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to achieve this in Python:\n\n### 1. Define the Character Set\nDefine a character set that includes all lowercase and uppercase letters and digits.\n\n```python\nimport string\n\nCHARSET = string.ascii_lowercase + string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits\nBASE = len(CHARSET)\n```\n\n### 2. Convert Integer to Base-62\n\nCreate a function to convert an integer to a base-62 encoded string.\n\n```python\ndef encode(num):\n    if num == 0:\n        return CHARSET[0]\n    encoded = []\n    while num > 0:\n        num, rem = divmod(num, BASE)\n        encoded.append(CHARSET[rem])\n    return ''.join(reversed(encoded))\n```\n\n### 3. Convert Base-62 to Integer\n\nCreate a function to convert a base-62 encoded string back to an integer.\n\n```python\ndef decode(encoded_str):\n    num = 0\n    for char in encoded_str:\n        num = num * BASE + CHARSET.index(char)\n    return num\n```\n\n### 4. Testing the Functions\n\nTest the encoding and decoding functions to ensure they work as expected.\n\n```python\n# Example usage\nnode_id = 104\nshort_url_segment = encode(node_id)\nprint(f\"Encoded {node_id} to {short_url_segment}\")  # Output: \"Encoded 104 to ZZ\"\n\ndecoded_id = decode(short_url_segment)\nprint(f\"Decoded {short_url_segment} to {decoded_id}\")  # Output: \"Decoded ZZ to 104\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Encode Function**: This function takes an integer and converts it into a base-62 string by repeatedly dividing the number by 62 and storing the remainder. The remainder is used as an index to retrieve the character from the `CHARSET`.\n  \n- **Decode Function**: This function reverses the encoding process by iterating over each character of the base-62 string, calculating its index in the `CHARSET`, and reconstructing the integer.\n\n### URL Structure\n\nWhen implementing this in your URL shortener, you would typically append the encoded string to your domain, like `short.com/ZZ`. When a request comes to this URL, you decode the string `ZZ` back to its integer form to retrieve the original node ID and redirect the user accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures a compact representation and efficient conversion between node IDs and shortened URLs."
