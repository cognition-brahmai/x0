Here's the code that I used:\n\n```python\nclass A(object):\n    ARG = 1\n\nB = deepcopy(A)\n\nprint(A().ARG)  # Outputs: 1\nprint(B().ARG)  # Outputs: 1\n\nA.ARG = 2\nprint(B().ARG)  # Outputs: 2\n```\n\nAs you can see, changing the `ARG` attribute in class `A` also changes it in the copied class `B`. Is there another way to copy a class in Python without having this issue? I've considered subclassing `A` to create `B`, like so:\n\n```python\nclass B(A):\n    pass\n```\n\nBut I am wondering if there's a different, possibly better way to do it."

        "content": "When you use `deepcopy` from the `copy` module, it doesn't work for classes in the way you might expect. The `deepcopy` function is intended for instances of classes (objects), not the classes themselves. In Python, classes are objects too, but they are more complex and `deepcopy` doesn't handle them in a way that creates independent copies.\n\nYour subclassing approach works but it still links `B` to `A`, so changes to class variables in `A` will also reflect in `B` unless you explicitly override them in `B`.\n\nIf you want to copy a class in such a way that changes to the original class do not affect the copied class, you can manually create a new class with the same attributes and methods. Here's a way to achieve that using metaprogramming:\n\n```python\nimport types\n\nclass A(object):\n    ARG = 1\n\n# Manually create a new class with the same attributes\nB = types.new_class('B', (object,))\nB.ARG = A.ARG\n\n# Copy any other attributes or methods from A\nfor name, value in A.__dict__.items():\n    if name not in ('__dict__', '__weakref__', '__doc__', '__module__'):\n        setattr(B, name, value)\n\nprint(A().ARG)  # Outputs: 1\nprint(B().ARG)  # Outputs: 1\n\nA.ARG = 2\nprint(B().ARG)  # Still outputs: 1\n```\n\nThis approach manually creates a new class `B` using `types.new_class` and copies over attributes from `A`. Note that if `A` has methods or any special handling, you'll need to ensure those are copied correctly too. This method provides more control over what gets copied and ensures that changes to `A` do not affect `B`."
