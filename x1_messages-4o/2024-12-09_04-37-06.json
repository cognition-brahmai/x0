I have referred to the official PEP 8 Style Guide and the PEP 8 Advanced Usage guide, but could not find specific guidance on this. I see that the unittest documentation uses examples like TestSequenceFunctions and DefaultWidgetSizeTestCase, but I am not sure if I should use \"Name\"Test or Test\"Name\" formats. I am aware that methods use the test_\"name\" format, but I'm struggling to find a similar convention for classes. Could you provide some guidance on this?"

        "content": "When it comes to naming test classes in Python, PEP 8 doesn't provide explicit guidelines specifically for test class names. However, the common practice aligns with the general class naming conventions in PEP 8, which suggests using CamelCase for class names.\n\nThe convention for naming test classes typically involves starting with the word \"Test\" followed by the name of the function, class, or module being tested. This makes it clear that the class is intended for testing purposes. Here are some general guidelines you can follow:\n\n1. **TestName Format**: This format is commonly used. For example, if you're testing a class named `Widget`, a corresponding test class might be named `TestWidget`.\n\n2. **Descriptive Naming**: If you're testing specific functionality or scenarios within a class, you can create more descriptive test class names. For example, if you're testing sequence functions, `TestSequenceFunctions` is a good name.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Whatever naming convention you choose, consistency is key. Stick to a format that makes sense for your project and helps others understand the purpose of the test class at a glance.\n\nHere are a few examples:\n- If you're testing a class named `Calculator`, you might name your test class `TestCalculator`.\n- If you're testing a specific feature of a `User` class, you might have a test class named `TestUserAuthentication`.\n\nBy following these conventions, your test class names will be clear and informative, making it easier for others to understand the scope and purpose of your tests."
