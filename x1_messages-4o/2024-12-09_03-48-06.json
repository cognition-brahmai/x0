        "content": "Yes, you can use the `simplejson` library, which is a standalone version of the JSON module that was included in Python 2.6 and later. `simplejson` is compatible with Python 2.5, and you can easily install it and use it in your project.\n\nHere's how you can install and use `simplejson` in Python 2.5:\n\n1. **Install simplejson**: You can download and install `simplejson` from the Python Package Index (PyPI). Since `pip` may not be available for Python 2.5, you can download the package manually from the [simplejson PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/simplejson/) and install it using the `setup.py` script.\n\n2. **Using simplejson**: Once installed, you can use `simplejson` in your code just like you would use the built-in JSON module in Python 2.6 and later. Here\u2019s an example:\n\n   ```python\n   import simplejson as json\n\n   # Encoding a Python object into JSON\n   data = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}\n   json_data = json.dumps(data)\n\n   print(json_data)  # Output: {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"}\n\n   # Decoding JSON back into a Python object\n   decoded_data = json.loads(json_data)\n\n   print(decoded_data)  # Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}\n   ```\n\nBy using `simplejson`, you can work with JSON data in Python 2.5 without having to upgrade your Python version."
