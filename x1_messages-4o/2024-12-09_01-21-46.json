I understand that the Cross Entropy formula is supposed to give the value '0' for '1*log(1)'. However, why does the following code result in 'loss = 0.7437' instead of 'loss = 0'? Here is the code segment I am working with:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nfrom torch.autograd import Variable\n\noutput = Variable(torch.FloatTensor([0,0,0,1])).view(1, -1)\ntarget = Variable(torch.LongTensor([3]))\n\ncriterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()\nloss = criterion(output, target)\nprint(loss)\n```"

        "content": "The confusion you're experiencing is quite common when working with PyTorch's `nn.CrossEntropyLoss`. The key thing to remember is how `CrossEntropyLoss` works in PyTorch.\n\n1. **Output Format**: The output you provide to the `CrossEntropyLoss` should be the raw, unnormalized scores (also called logits) from the network, not probabilities. These logits are then passed through a `Softmax` internally by `CrossEntropyLoss` to convert them into probabilities.\n\n2. **Target Format**: The target should be the class indices (0-based index for classes).\n\nIn your code, `output = Variable(torch.FloatTensor([0,0,0,1])).view(1, -1)` is interpreted as logits for 4 classes. These are not probabilities, even though it looks like you are trying to encode a probability distribution. The `1` in the output tensor is just a score, not a probability.\n\nWhen you pass this to `CrossEntropyLoss`, it applies `Softmax` to the logits, which converts `[0, 0, 0, 1]` to a probability distribution. The class with the highest score (logit = 1) will have the highest probability after `Softmax`.\n\nHere's how you should modify your code:\n\n- **Logits**: If you want to simulate a certain class being the correct output, you should ensure your logit for that class is higher than the others.\n\nFor example, you could use the following:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\n# Simulated logits for 4 classes where the last class has the highest score\noutput = torch.FloatTensor([[0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 10.0]])  # The fourth class has the highest logit\ntarget = torch.LongTensor([3])  # The target class index\n\ncriterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()\nloss = criterion(output, target)\nprint(loss)\n```\n\nBy ensuring the logit corresponding to the target class is much higher than the others, you will see a much lower loss, closer to what you expect.\n\nIn summary, make sure your input to the `CrossEntropyLoss` are raw logits and not probabilities, and ensure the logit for the target class is appropriately higher than the others if you want a low cross-entropy loss."
