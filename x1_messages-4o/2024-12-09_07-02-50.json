        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is likely due to a misunderstanding of the imports or the environment in which you are working. Let's go through some steps to help resolve this:\n\n1. **Python Version**: Ensure you are using Python 3. The `unittest.mock` module is included in Python's standard library starting from Python 3.3. If you are using Python 2.x, you will need to install the `mock` library via pip and import it as `import mock` instead.\n\n2. **Correct Import**: If you're using Python 3, your import statement should be fine as `from unittest.mock import MagicMock`. Ensure there are no typos or syntax errors in your script.\n\n3. **Environment Activation**: Make sure your virtual environment is activated (if you are using one). Sometimes the installed packages are not recognized if the correct environment is not active.\n\n4. **Module Installation**: Although `unittest.mock` is part of the standard library in Python 3, if you're using Python 2, run the following command to install `mock`:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install mock\n   ```\n\n   Then, import it using:\n\n   ```python\n   from mock import MagicMock\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify Installation**: Double-check that the `mock` library is installed in the environment you're running your script in. You can list all installed packages using:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip list\n   ```\n\n6. **Check for Conflicts**: Ensure there are no files named `mock.py` in your project directory, as this could cause import conflicts.\n\n7. **Python Path**: Ensure that your script is running with the correct Python interpreter. If you have multiple versions of Python installed, you might accidentally be running your script with the wrong version.\n\n8. **IDE Configuration**: If you're using an IDE, make sure it's configured to use the correct Python interpreter and environment.\n\nIf you've verified all the above and are still facing issues, try running a minimal test script to see if the import works in isolation:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    from unittest.mock import MagicMock\n    print(\"Import successful\")\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    print(f\"Import failed: {e}\")\n```\n\nThis should help you determine if the issue lies with the environment or elsewhere in your code."
