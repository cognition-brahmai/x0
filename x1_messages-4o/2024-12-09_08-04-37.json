What is `inf` used for in Python? Moreover, I noticed that when I add `-inf + inf`, it returns `nan`. Is `nan` the same as zero? What's the purpose of having these values? Lastly, when I try `nan - inf`, I don't get `-inf` but `nan`. Can you explain why?"

        "content": "In Python, `inf` and `nan` are special floating-point values defined by the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic. They are used to represent certain concepts in computations that involve real numbers.\n\n### `inf` (Infinity)\n\n- **Purpose**: `inf` is used to represent an infinitely large positive number. This is typically used in scenarios where a value exceeds the largest representable floating-point number, or when certain mathematical limits are involved.\n- **Usage**: It's often used in mathematical calculations, comparisons, and algorithms that need to represent the concept of \"beyond any finite value.\"\n\nExamples:\n- `float('inf')`: Represents positive infinity.\n- `float('-inf')`: Represents negative infinity.\n\n### `nan` (Not a Number)\n\n- **Purpose**: `nan` stands for \"Not a Number\" and is used to represent undefined or unrepresentable values, especially in floating-point calculations.\n- **Usage**: It often appears as a result of indeterminate forms like `0/0`, `inf - inf`, or operations involving an invalid value.\n\n### Operations and Results\n\n- **Arithmetic with `inf`**:\n  - Adding or multiplying infinities follows intuitive rules, e.g., `inf + inf` results in `inf`, and `inf * 2` results in `inf`.\n  - However, operations like `inf - inf` are undefined in mathematical terms, leading to a `nan` result because it's indeterminate.\n\n- **Arithmetic with `nan`**:\n  - `nan` is not equal to any number, including itself. This means if you perform comparisons like `nan == nan`, it will return `False`.\n  - Operations involving `nan` generally result in `nan`, because any arithmetic operation with an undefined value remains undefined. This is why `nan - inf` results in `nan`.\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Zero vs. `nan`**: `nan` is not the same as zero. Zero is a well-defined numeric value, whereas `nan` indicates an undefined or unrepresentable result.\n- **Checking for `nan` and `inf`**: Use `math.isnan(x)` to check for `nan` and `math.isinf(x)` to check for infinity.\n\nThese special values are essential in numerical computations to handle edge cases and maintain robustness in mathematical operations. They allow programs to continue running and handle exceptional cases gracefully without crashing."
