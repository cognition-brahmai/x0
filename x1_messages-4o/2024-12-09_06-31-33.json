        "content": "Yes, there are several lightweight database wrappers in Python that you can use for SQLite, similar to Django's ORM. One popular option is **Peewee**. Peewee is a small, expressive ORM that provides a simple and Pythonic way to interact with databases, including SQLite. It's designed to be easy to use and has a straightforward API for performing CRUD operations.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you can use Peewee with an SQLite database:\n\n1. **Installation**: First, you need to install Peewee. You can do this using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install peewee\n   ```\n\n2. **Basic Usage**:\n\n   ```python\n   from peewee import *\n\n   # Define the database connection\n   db = SqliteDatabase('my_database.db')\n\n   # Define a model\n   class BaseModel(Model):\n       class Meta:\n           database = db\n\n   class User(BaseModel):\n       username = CharField(unique=True)\n       email = CharField()\n\n   # Create the tables\n   db.connect()\n   db.create_tables([User])\n\n   # Create a new user\n   user = User.create(username='john_doe', email='john@example.com')\n\n   # Retrieve a user\n   retrieved_user = User.get(User.username == 'john_doe')\n   print(retrieved_user.email)\n\n   # Update a user\n   retrieved_user.email = 'john.doe@example.com'\n   retrieved_user.save()\n\n   # Delete a user\n   retrieved_user.delete_instance()\n   ```\n\nPeewee provides a lot more functionality, including support for complex queries, relationships, and even integration with Flask and other web frameworks. It's a great choice if you're looking for something lightweight and easy to use.\n\nAnother option to consider is **SQLAlchemy**, which is a more comprehensive ORM and provides a lot of flexibility and power, though it might be a bit heavier than Peewee for simple use cases. However, if you are already familiar with Django and its ORM, Peewee should feel quite intuitive."
