        "content": "To extract the feature names from a complex scikit-learn pipeline that includes Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), you need to carefully navigate through the pipeline components. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n1. **Access the RFE Step**: First, ensure that you can access the RFE step in your pipeline. If your pipeline is named `pipeline`, and the RFE step is the last step, you can access it as follows:\n\n   ```python\n   rfe = pipeline.named_steps['rfe']\n   ```\n\n   Replace `'rfe'` with the actual name of the RFE step in your pipeline if it's different.\n\n2. **Access the Support Mask**: RFE has an attribute called `support_` which is a boolean array indicating which features are selected:\n\n   ```python\n   support_mask = rfe.support_\n   ```\n\n3. **Get Feature Names from Preceding Steps**: You need to extract the feature names from the step that precedes RFE. This is usually the output of a transformer or the result of a FeatureUnion. You should locate the final transformation step before RFE in your pipeline and extract the feature names from it. For instance, if it's a `FeatureUnion` or another transformer like `ColumnTransformer`, you can do something like:\n\n   ```python\n   # Assuming the step before RFE is a FeatureUnion or ColumnTransformer\n   feature_names = preceding_step.get_feature_names_out()\n   ```\n\n   Replace `preceding_step` with the actual step name or object in your pipeline.\n\n4. **Apply the Support Mask**: Use the boolean support mask to filter the feature names:\n\n   ```python\n   selected_feature_names = feature_names[support_mask]\n   ```\n\n5. **Handle Nested Pipelines**: If your pipeline is nested (i.e., contains sub-pipelines), you may need to recursively navigate through the pipeline structure to get to the relevant transformation step. This might involve iterating through the steps of the `FeatureUnion` or sub-pipelines and extracting feature names at each level.\n\nHere's a simple example to illustrate the process:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import RFE\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import SelectPercentile\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Dummy pipeline components\nfeature_union = ...  # Some FeatureUnion or ColumnTransformer\npercentile_selector = SelectPercentile(percentile=50)\nrfe = RFE(estimator=LogisticRegression())\n\n# Example pipeline\npipeline = Pipeline(steps=[\n    ('feature_union', feature_union),\n    ('percentile_selector', percentile_selector),\n    ('rfe', rfe)\n])\n\n# Fit the pipeline to your data\npipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Access feature names from the step before RFE\npreceding_step = pipeline.named_steps['feature_union']\nfeature_names = preceding_step.get_feature_names_out()\n\n# Get the support mask from RFE and filter the feature names\nsupport_mask = rfe.support_\nselected_feature_names = feature_names[support_mask]\n\nprint(selected_feature_names)\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `feature_union` with your actual FeatureUnion or ColumnTransformer and adjust the step names accordingly. This approach will allow you to extract the selected feature names correctly."
