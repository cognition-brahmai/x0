        "content": "Certainly! To modify the JavaScript function to both determine the degree of difficulty and count the number of variables in each equation, you can create a function that analyzes each equation in the set. Here\u2019s how you could implement such a function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction analyzeEquations(equations) {\n    return equations.map(equation => {\n        // Regular expression to find variables (assumes single-letter variables)\n        const variablePattern = /[a-zA-Z]/g;\n        \n        // Regular expression to find exponents (degree of difficulty)\n        const exponentPattern = /\\^(\\d+)/g;\n        \n        // Extract variables\n        const variables = equation.match(variablePattern);\n        const numberOfVariables = variables ? new Set(variables).size : 0;\n\n        // Extract exponents\n        let degreeOfDifficulty = 1;\n        let match;\n        while ((match = exponentPattern.exec(equation)) !== null) {\n            const exponent = parseInt(match[1], 10);\n            degreeOfDifficulty = Math.max(degreeOfDifficulty, exponent);\n        }\n\n        return {\n            equation,\n            degreeOfDifficulty,\n            numberOfVariables\n        };\n    });\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst equations = [\n    \"3x^2 + 2y - z = 0\",\n    \"a^4 + b^3 - c = 10\",\n    \"x + y = z\"\n];\n\nconst result = analyzeEquations(equations);\nconsole.log(result);\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Variable Detection**: The function uses a regular expression `[a-zA-Z]` to find single-letter variables. It then uses a `Set` to ensure each variable is counted once, regardless of how many times it appears in the equation.\n\n2. **Degree of Difficulty**: The function uses a regular expression `\\^(\\d+)` to find numbers following a caret (`^`), assuming they represent exponents. The highest exponent found in the equation is taken as the degree of difficulty.\n\n3. **Output**: The function returns an array of objects, each containing the original equation, the computed degree of difficulty, and the number of unique variables.\n\nThis solution assumes variables are represented by single letters and exponents are indicated using the caret symbol (`^`). Adjust the regular expressions if your equations have a different format."
