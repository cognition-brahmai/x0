        "content": "The error you're encountering usually occurs when there's an issue with the `pip` installation, often due to an incomplete or corrupted update. Here's a step-by-step guide to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Python and Pip Versions:**\n   Make sure your Python and pip versions are consistent and functioning. Run the following commands to check:\n   ```shell\n   python --version\n   pip --version\n   ```\n\n2. **Reinstall Pip:**\n   Sometimes, simply reinstalling pip can resolve this issue. You can do this by using the `get-pip.py` script:\n   - Download `get-pip.py` from [https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py).\n   - Open a command prompt in the directory where `get-pip.py` is located.\n   - Run the following command:\n     ```shell\n     python get-pip.py\n     ```\n\n3. **Ensure Environment Variables Are Correct:**\n   Ensure that your system's PATH environment variable includes the directory where Python and pip are installed. Typically, it should include something like `C:\\Program Files\\Python37\\Scripts` and `C:\\Program Files\\Python37`.\n\n4. **Remove and Reinstall Pip:**\n   If the above steps don't work, try uninstalling and reinstalling pip:\n   - Navigate to the directory where Python is installed. Locate the `pip` folder inside `Scripts` and delete it.\n   - Re-run the `get-pip.py` script as shown above to reinstall pip.\n\n5. **Check Python Scripts Directory:**\n   Make sure that the `pip` executable is not corrupted. It should be located in the `Scripts` directory of your Python installation. If it's missing or corrupted, reinstalling pip as described should restore it.\n\n6. **Use Python to Manage Pip:**\n   You can use Python directly to manage pip:\n   ```shell\n   python -m ensurepip\n   python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n   ```\n\n7. **Use a Virtual Environment:**\n   If you're still having issues, consider using a virtual environment to isolate your Python setup:\n   ```shell\n   python -m venv myenv\n   myenv\\Scripts\\activate\n   pip install matplotlib\n   ```\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, a more detailed investigation into your Python installation and environment configuration might be necessary."
