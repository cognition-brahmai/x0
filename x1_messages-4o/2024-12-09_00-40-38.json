This means I need all permutations of size 2 from the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], including repetitions like (1,1), (1,2), (2,1) and so on. I'm aware of the itertools module, but it seems to only generate permutations without repetitions. I'd like to achieve this without having to implement it from scratch. Is there a way to do this?"

        "content": "Yes, you can generate permutations with repetitions in Python using the `itertools.product` function. This function is perfect for your use case because it generates the Cartesian product of input iterables, which means it will include all possible combinations including repetitions.\n\nHere's how you can use `itertools.product` to generate all possible outcomes for rolling two six-sided dice:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# List of possible values for a single die\ndice_faces = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n\n# Generate all possible rolls for two dice\nall_rolls = list(itertools.product(dice_faces, repeat=2))\n\n# Print the results\nfor roll in all_rolls:\n    print(roll)\n```\n\nIn this code, `itertools.product(dice_faces, repeat=2)` generates all possible pairs of dice rolls, including repetitions. The `repeat=2` argument specifies that you want pairs (two dice) from the input list. The result is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a possible roll of the two dice."
