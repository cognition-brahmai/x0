I tried defining them in my project's main.py file and tried to use them in subfile.py but it didn't work. I also tried another approach where I imported a globfile and saved myList into globfile, but that didn't work either. How can I define these global variables across multiple files without using IO writing or pickle?"

        "content": "To define global variables across multiple files in a Python project, you can use a dedicated module (a Python file) to store your global variables. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n1. **Create a Globals Module:**\n   Create a new Python file, let's call it `globals.py`, where you will define your global variables.\n\n   ```python\n   # globals.py\n   my_list = []  # Define your global variables here\n   my_dict = {}\n   my_string = \"Hello, World!\"\n   # Add other global variables as needed\n   ```\n\n2. **Import the Globals Module in Other Files:**\n   In any file where you want to access or modify these global variables, import the `globals` module.\n\n   ```python\n   # subfile.py\n\n   import globals\n\n   def modify_globals():\n       globals.my_list.append(1)\n       globals.my_dict['key'] = 'value'\n       globals.my_string = \"Hello, Python!\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Access and Modify Global Variables:**\n   You can now access and modify the global variables defined in `globals.py` from any other file by using the module's name as a prefix.\n\n4. **Ensure Consistent Usage:**\n   Make sure to always import the `globals` module instead of the specific variables directly. This ensures that you are working with the same set of variables across different files.\n\n5. **Example Usage in `main.py`:**\n\n   ```python\n   # main.py\n\n   import globals\n   import subfile\n\n   def main():\n       print(globals.my_string)  # Output: Hello, World!\n       subfile.modify_globals()  # Modify global variables\n       print(globals.my_string)  # Output: Hello, Python!\n       print(globals.my_list)    # Output: [1]\n       print(globals.my_dict)    # Output: {'key': 'value'}\n\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       main()\n   ```\n\nBy following this approach, you can effectively manage and share global variables across multiple files in your project without resorting to file I/O or serialization methods like pickle."
