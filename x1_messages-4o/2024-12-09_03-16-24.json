A few days ago, I managed to get to the point where it was launching, but I was unable to access it via URL. Now, it's not launching at all and I'm getting a specific error: \"No module named notebook.notebookapp\". I have installed the Anaconda distribution of ipython and the pyzmq & tornado libraries. I have also created a profile nbserver and configured it as shown in the code below. Can you help me understand why this is happening and how to solve it?\n\n```\nc = get_config()\nc.IPKernalApp.pylab = 'inline'\nc.NotebookApp.certfile = u'/home/ludo/.ipython/profile_nbserver/mycert.pem'\nc.NotebookApp.ip = '*'\nc.NotebookApp.open_browser = False\nc.NotebookApp.password = u'sha1:e6cb2aa9a[...]'\nc.NotebookApp.port = 9999\nc.NotebookManager.notebook_dir = u'/var/www/ipynb/'\nc.NotebookApp.base_project_url = '/ipynb/'\nc.NotebookApp.base_kernel_url = '/ipynb/'\nc.NotebookApp.webapp_settings = {'static_url_prefix':'/ipynb/static/'}\n```"

        "content": "The error message \"No module named notebook.notebookapp\" suggests that the Jupyter Notebook package is not installed or not correctly set up in your Python environment. Here are some steps to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify Installation**:\n   - Ensure that Jupyter Notebook is installed in your environment. You can do this by running:\n     ```bash\n     conda list jupyter\n     ```\n   - If it's not listed, you can install it using:\n     ```bash\n     conda install jupyter\n     ```\n   - If you're using pip, you can install it with:\n     ```bash\n     pip install notebook\n     ```\n\n2. **Check Python Environment**:\n   - Make sure you are using the correct Python environment where Jupyter is installed. If using Anaconda, activate the environment first:\n     ```bash\n     conda activate your_environment_name\n     ```\n\n3. **Update Packages**:\n   - Sometimes, updating the packages can solve such issues. You can update Jupyter and its dependencies with:\n     ```bash\n     conda update jupyter\n     ```\n\n4. **Review Configuration**:\n   - Check your configuration file for any typos. It seems like there might be a typo in `c.IPKernalApp.pylab`, which should be `c.IPKernelApp.pylab`.\n   - Also, make sure the path to the certificate file and other directories are correct and accessible.\n\n5. **Remove Old Configuration**:\n   - If the configuration is corrupted, you might want to remove it and start fresh by deleting the profile directory:\n     ```bash\n     rm -rf ~/.ipython/profile_nbserver\n     ```\n   - Then, recreate the profile:\n     ```bash\n     ipython profile create nbserver\n     ```\n\n6. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:\n   - Try launching Jupyter Notebook again:\n     ```bash\n     jupyter notebook\n     ```\n\n7. **Check Logs**:\n   - If it still doesn't work, check the logs for any additional error messages that might provide more insight.\n\nAfter following these steps, your Jupyter Notebook server should launch without the \"No module named notebook.notebookapp\" error. Let me know if you need further assistance!"
