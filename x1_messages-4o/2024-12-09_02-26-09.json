My code doesn't seem to have any syntax errors, but my data isn't getting inserted into the database for some reason. Here's the code snippet:\n\n```python\nconn = psycopg2.connect(connection)\ncursor = conn.cursor()\nitems = pickle.load(open(pickle_file,\"rb\"))\n\nfor item in items:\n    city = item[0]\n    price = item[1]\n    info = item[2]\n\n    query =  \"INSERT INTO items (info, city, price) VALUES (%s, %s, %s);\"\n    data = (info, city, price)\n\n    cursor.execute(query, data)\n```\n\nWhat could be the issue here?"

        "content": "Based on the code snippet you've provided, one potential issue that might prevent data from being inserted into your PostgreSQL database is that you might be missing the transaction commit step. In PostgreSQL, after executing insert operations, you need to commit the transaction for changes to take effect. Here\u2019s how you can modify your code to include the commit statement:\n\n```python\nimport psycopg2\nimport pickle\n\n# Assuming 'connection' and 'pickle_file' are defined\nconn = psycopg2.connect(connection)\ncursor = conn.cursor()\nitems = pickle.load(open(pickle_file, \"rb\"))\n\nfor item in items:\n    city = item[0]\n    price = item[1]\n    info = item[2]\n\n    query =  \"INSERT INTO items (info, city, price) VALUES (%s, %s, %s);\"\n    data = (info, city, price)\n\n    cursor.execute(query, data)\n\n# Commit the transaction\nconn.commit()\n\n# Optionally, you can close the cursor and connection\ncursor.close()\nconn.close()\n```\n\nMake sure that you are also handling exceptions properly and closing your database connection when you're done to avoid any potential issues. Here's a more complete example with error handling:\n\n```python\nimport psycopg2\nimport pickle\n\ntry:\n    # Assuming 'connection' and 'pickle_file' are defined\n    conn = psycopg2.connect(connection)\n    cursor = conn.cursor()\n    items = pickle.load(open(pickle_file, \"rb\"))\n\n    for item in items:\n        city = item[0]\n        price = item[1]\n        info = item[2]\n\n        query = \"INSERT INTO items (info, city, price) VALUES (%s, %s, %s);\"\n        data = (info, city, price)\n\n        cursor.execute(query, data)\n\n    # Commit the transaction\n    conn.commit()\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n    conn.rollback()\n\nfinally:\n    # Close the cursor and connection\n    cursor.close()\n    conn.close()\n```\n\nThis code ensures that any errors are caught, and it rolls back the transaction in case of an error to maintain database integrity."
