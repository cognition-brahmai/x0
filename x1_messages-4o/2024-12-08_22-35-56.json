This data can be stored in a JSON format like so:\n{\n  \"planet\": {\n    \"mass\": 3.3e23,\n    \"semi-major-axis\": 1.5e11\n  },\n  \"sun\": {\n    \"mass\": 1.989e30\n  },\n  \"gravitational-constant\": 6.67408e-11\n}\nNext, use Kepler's Third Law, which states that the square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis. This equation can be expressed in JSON code like so:\n{\n  \"orbital-period\": Math.sqrt(Math.pow(4 * Math.PI * Math.PI, 2) * Math.pow(data.planet['semi-major-axis'], 3) / (data.sun.mass * data.gravitational-constant))\n}\nFinally, plug in the data and solve for the planet's orbital period. The result will be in seconds."

        "content": "To calculate a planet's orbital period using JSON data and Kepler's Third Law, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Parse the JSON Data**: First, you need to parse the JSON data to extract the necessary values. This includes the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, the mass of the sun, and the gravitational constant.\n\n   Here's an example of parsing the JSON data in JavaScript:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const data = {\n     \"planet\": {\n       \"mass\": 3.3e23,\n       \"semi-major-axis\": 1.5e11\n     },\n     \"sun\": {\n       \"mass\": 1.989e30\n     },\n     \"gravitational-constant\": 6.67408e-11\n   };\n   ```\n\n2. **Apply Kepler's Third Law**: Kepler's Third Law in terms of orbital period (T) is:\n\n   \\[\n   T^2 = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 a^3}{G M}\n   \\]\n\n   Where:\n   - \\( T \\) is the orbital period,\n   - \\( a \\) is the semi-major axis,\n   - \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant,\n   - \\( M \\) is the mass of the sun.\n\n3. **Calculate the Orbital Period**: Using the formula, calculate the orbital period. In JavaScript, you can perform this calculation as follows:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const semiMajorAxis = data.planet['semi-major-axis'];\n   const sunMass = data.sun.mass;\n   const gravitationalConstant = data['gravitational-constant'];\n\n   const orbitalPeriod = Math.sqrt((4 * Math.PI * Math.PI * Math.pow(semiMajorAxis, 3)) / (gravitationalConstant * sunMass));\n   ```\n\n4. **Convert the Result to Years (Optional)**: Since the result will be in seconds, you might want to convert it to years for a more intuitive understanding. There are approximately \\( 3.154 \\times 10^7 \\) seconds in a year.\n\n   ```javascript\n   const orbitalPeriodInYears = orbitalPeriod / (60 * 60 * 24 * 365.25);\n   ```\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Finally, log the result or use it as needed:\n\n   ```javascript\n   console.log(`The orbital period is approximately ${orbitalPeriodInYears.toFixed(2)} years.`);\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you can calculate the orbital period of a planet using JSON data with Kepler's Third Law."
