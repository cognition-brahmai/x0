        "content": "Certainly! An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. Here's a Python function to check if a given number is an Armstrong number:\n\n```python\ndef is_armstrong_number(number):\n    # Convert the number to a string to easily iterate over its digits\n    num_str = str(number)\n    # Calculate the number of digits (n)\n    num_digits = len(num_str)\n    # Calculate the sum of each digit raised to the power of n\n    sum_of_powers = sum(int(digit) ** num_digits for digit in num_str)\n    # Check if the sum of powers is equal to the original number\n    return sum_of_powers == number\n\n# Example usage:\nnumber = 153\nif is_armstrong_number(number):\n    print(f\"{number} is an Armstrong number.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"{number} is not an Armstrong number.\")\n```\n\nYou can test this function with other numbers to see if they are Armstrong numbers. For example, `153` and `370` are Armstrong numbers."
