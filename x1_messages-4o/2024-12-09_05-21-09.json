The error message is:\n\n```\nEmilios-MacBook-Pro:documents emilioramirezeguia$ jupyter notebook\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Users/emilioramirezeguia/miniconda2/bin/jupyter-notebook\", line 7, in \n    from notebook.notebookapp import main\n  File \"/Users/emilioramirezeguia/miniconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/notebook/notebookapp.py\", line 45, in \n    ioloop.install()\n  File \"/Users/emilioramirezeguia/miniconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/zmq/eventloop/ioloop.py\", line 210, in install\n    assert (not ioloop.IOLoop.initialized()) or \\\nAttributeError: type object 'IOLoop' has no attribute 'initialized'\n```\nHow can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is likely due to compatibility issues between certain packages in your Python 2.7 environment. Here's a step-by-step approach to resolving the issue:\n\n1. **Update Conda**: Ensure that Conda itself is up-to-date. This can resolve some issues with package dependencies.\n   ```bash\n   conda update conda\n   ```\n\n2. **Update All Packages**: It's possible that some packages need to be updated for compatibility.\n   ```bash\n   conda update --all\n   ```\n\n3. **Consider Switching to Python 3**: Python 2.7 is no longer supported, and many packages may not work correctly with it. If possible, create a new environment with Python 3 and install Jupyter there:\n   ```bash\n   conda create -n py3_jupyter python=3.9\n   conda activate py3_jupyter\n   conda install jupyter\n   ```\n\n4. **Reinstall Jupyter in the Current Environment**: If you want to stick with Python 2.7, try reinstalling Jupyter and its dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   conda remove jupyter jupyter_core jupyter_client jupyter_console\n   conda install jupyter\n   ```\n\n5. **Check ZMQ and Tornado Versions**: The error may be related to specific versions of `zmq` and `tornado`. You can try installing specific compatible versions:\n   ```bash\n   conda install pyzmq=17\n   conda install tornado=4.5.3\n   ```\n\n6. **Check for Conflicting Packages**: Sometimes, other installed packages may cause conflicts. Review your environment and consider creating a fresh environment if the issue persists.\n\n7. **Manual Installation with pip**: If `conda` does not resolve the issue, you can try installing Jupyter using `pip`:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade pip\n   pip install jupyter\n   ```\n\n8. **Recheck the Path**: Ensure that your terminal is using the correct Python and Jupyter paths. You can check with:\n   ```bash\n   which python\n   which jupyter\n   ```\n\nAfter trying these steps, run `jupyter notebook` again. If you're still experiencing issues, consider reviewing the specific error messages for more clues, or provide them for further assistance."
