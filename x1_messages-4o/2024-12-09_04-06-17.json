        "content": "To select certain rows from a Pandas DataFrame using a Boolean Series, you can use the Boolean Series to index the DataFrame. However, it's important to ensure that the Boolean Series aligns with the DataFrame's index for proper selection.\n\nGiven your DataFrame and Boolean Series, you can achieve the desired result with the following steps:\n\n1. First, make sure the Boolean Series aligns with the DataFrame's index. You might need to set the DataFrame's index or adjust the Boolean Series accordingly.\n\n2. Use the Boolean Series to filter the DataFrame.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create the DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'High': [30.20, 30.28, 30.45, 29.35, 29.35],\n    'Low': [29.41, 29.32, 29.96, 28.74, 28.56],\n    'Close': [29.87, 30.24, 30.10, 28.90, 28.92]\n}\nindex = ['2009-02-11', '2009-02-12', '2009-02-13', '2009-02-17', '2009-02-18']\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data, index=index)\n\n# Create the Boolean Series\nbools = pd.Series([True, False, False, True, False], index=index)\n\n# Use the Boolean Series to select rows from the DataFrame\nfiltered_df = df[bools]\n\n# Select only the 'High' column\nresult = filtered_df[['High']]\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will give you the output:\n\n```\n             High\n2009-02-11  30.20\n2009-02-17  29.35\n```\n\nIn this example, the Boolean Series has been used to filter the rows of the DataFrame where the value is `True`, and then only the 'High' column is selected from the filtered DataFrame."
