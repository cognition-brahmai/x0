When I print `sys.path`, I see something like this: `[..., PosixPath('/opt/project/apps')]`. How should I revise my code? Is it normal to write `str(PROJECT_DIR / 'apps')`?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is because you're trying to append a `Path` object to `sys.path`, which expects strings. The `sys.path.append()` method requires a string representation of the path. You can fix the issue by converting the `Path` object to a string using the `str()` function. Here's how you can revise your code:\n\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport sys\n\nPROJECT_DIR = Path(__file__).parents[2]\nsys.path.append(\n    str(PROJECT_DIR / 'apps')\n)\n```\n\nBy converting the `Path` object to a string using `str()`, you ensure that the path is correctly added to `sys.path` as a string. This should resolve the issue and allow your directory to be successfully added to the Python path."
