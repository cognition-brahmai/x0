Although PyCharm does not directly support the exact behavior you're describing out of the box, you can achieve similar functionality with a few steps:\n\n1. **Surround With Feature:**\n   - Select the code you want to surround.\n   - Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Alt + T` (macOS) to bring up the \"Surround With\" menu.\n   - Choose the option for parentheses (or other desired characters).\n\n2. **Custom Keymap:**\n   - Go to `File` > `Settings` (or `PyCharm` > `Preferences` on macOS).\n   - Navigate to `Keymap`.\n   - In the search bar, type \"surround with\" to locate the action.\n   - You can add a new shortcut by right-clicking on the desired action and selecting \"Add Keyboard Shortcut\".\n\n3. **Live Templates (Optional):**\n   - You can create custom live templates to quickly wrap code snippets.\n   - Navigate to `File` > `Settings` > `Editor` > `Live Templates`.\n   - Create a new template and define the context and shortcut.\n\nWhile PyCharm may not replicate Sublime Text's behavior exactly, these methods will help streamline your workflow and surround code efficiently."
