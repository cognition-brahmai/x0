        "content": "To create a cohesive and harmonious color palette in Swift, especially when blending shades of blue and pink, you can enhance the current code by incorporating some color theory principles and algorithms. Let's first refine your Swift code to generate a more balanced palette:\n\n### Swift Code for Generating a Random Color Palette\n\n```swift\nimport UIKit\n\nfunc generateRandomPalette() -> [UIColor] {\n    let baseColors: [UIColor] = [.blue, .systemPink]\n    var palette: [UIColor] = []\n\n    for baseColor in baseColors {\n        for _ in 1...2 { // Generate two variations for each base color\n            let hueOffset = CGFloat.random(in: -0.1...0.1) // Small hue variation\n            let saturationOffset = CGFloat.random(in: 0.7...1.0) // Keep saturation high for vibrancy\n            let brightnessOffset = CGFloat.random(in: 0.7...1.0) // Ensure brightness is maintained\n\n            // Convert UIColor to HSB to manipulate color properties\n            var hue: CGFloat = 0\n            var saturation: CGFloat = 0\n            var brightness: CGFloat = 0\n            var alpha: CGFloat = 0\n\n            baseColor.getHue(&hue, saturation: &saturation, brightness: &brightness, alpha: &alpha)\n\n            // Create a new color with slight variations\n            let newColor = UIColor(\n                hue: min(max(hue + hueOffset, 0), 1),\n                saturation: saturation * saturationOffset,\n                brightness: brightness * brightnessOffset,\n                alpha: 1.0\n            )\n            \n            palette.append(newColor)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return palette\n}\n\n// Example usage\nlet palette = generateRandomPalette()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Hue, Saturation, and Brightness (HSB):** The code uses HSB to adjust colors because it's more intuitive for creating visually appealing palettes. Hue shifts allow for slight variations in color tone, while saturation and brightness adjustments prevent the colors from becoming too dull or too bright.\n- **Balanced Variations:** By generating two variations for each base color and slightly adjusting the hue, saturation, and brightness, you ensure a balanced mix of colors that remain true to the original shades.\n\n### Furniture, Decor, and Lighting Recommendations\n\n1. **Furniture:**\n   - **White or Light Wood:** Neutral tones like white or light wood complement the blue and pink palette, providing a clean and airy feel.\n   - **Accent Chairs/Pillows:** Consider using accent chairs or pillows in darker shades of blue or pink to add depth.\n   - **Metallic Accents:** Silver or gold metal elements (like legs of a table or handles) can add a touch of elegance.\n\n2. **Decor:**\n   - **Art Pieces:** Abstract or nature-themed art with hints of blue and pink can tie the room together.\n   - **Rugs:** A soft, plush rug in a neutral color with subtle patterns can ground the space.\n   - **Throws and Blankets:** Layering throws in various textures (like knit or silk) in coordinating colors enhance coziness.\n\n3. **Lighting:**\n   - **Soft White Lights:** Use soft white LED bulbs to maintain the warmth of the color scheme.\n   - **Table Lamps:** Consider lamps with blue or pink bases or shades to add interest.\n   - **Fairy Lights or String Lights:** These can add a whimsical touch, especially if draped around a bed frame or window.\n\nBy combining these elements, you can create a bedroom that feels cohesive and visually pleasing, with a balance of blue and pink tones."
