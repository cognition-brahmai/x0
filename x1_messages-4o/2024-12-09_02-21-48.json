This application involves two heavy IO tasks: an SNMP polling module, which determines the optimal server, and a \"proxy-like\" module, which balances the petitions to the selected server. Both of these processes are intended to run indefinitely and independently. Using a single event loop is problematic as they block each other. I attempted to resolve this by using asyncio.new_event_loop(), but haven't been successful yet. How can I have two event loops for these different tasks without resorting to multithreading or multiprocessing?"

        "content": "In Python's asyncio framework, having multiple event loops in the same thread is not directly supported. However, you can manage concurrent tasks within a single event loop using asyncio's cooperative multitasking capabilities. If you need to run blocking IO tasks concurrently, using threads or processes is typically recommended. Since you want to avoid multithreading or multiprocessing, let's focus on optimizing the use of a single event loop.\n\nHere are some strategies you can use to improve the performance of your asyncio-based application:\n\n1. **Use asyncio.gather() or asyncio.wait():** These functions can help you run multiple coroutines concurrently within a single event loop. You can use them to manage your SNMP polling and proxy tasks without blocking each other.\n\n    ```python\n    import asyncio\n\n    async def snmp_polling():\n        while True:\n            # Perform SNMP polling\n            await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate IO operation\n\n    async def proxy_module():\n        while True:\n            # Perform proxy-like operations\n            await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate IO operation\n\n    async def main():\n        await asyncio.gather(\n            snmp_polling(),\n            proxy_module()\n        )\n\n    asyncio.run(main())\n    ```\n\n2. **Optimize IO Operations:** Ensure that both SNMP polling and proxy operations are non-blocking. If any part of the operation is blocking (e.g., using a blocking library or function), consider using an async library or wrapping it in an executor.\n\n3. **Use asyncio.create_task():** This function allows you to schedule multiple coroutines as tasks within the same event loop. It provides more control over individual tasks.\n\n    ```python\n    async def main():\n        task1 = asyncio.create_task(snmp_polling())\n        task2 = asyncio.create_task(proxy_module())\n\n        await asyncio.gather(task1, task2)\n\n    asyncio.run(main())\n    ```\n\n4. **Manage Timeouts and Cancellation:** You can use asyncio's timeout and cancellation features to ensure that one task does not indefinitely block the other.\n\n5. **Profile and Optimize:** Use profiling to identify any bottlenecks in your code. This can help you determine if there are specific parts of your code that are causing issues.\n\n6. **Consider Third-Party Libraries:** Sometimes, using specialized libraries designed for specific tasks (like SNMP operations) with async support can significantly improve performance.\n\nIf these strategies do not resolve the issue, and if your tasks are inherently blocking, you may need to reconsider using threads or processes to handle them efficiently. However, for many applications, careful management of a single event loop with non-blocking IO should suffice."
