When I use the following code:\n\n```python\npd.date_range(start='1/1/1980', end='11/1/1991', freq='M')\n```\n\nIt generates dates like `1/31/1980`, `2/29/1980`, etc. but I want dates like `1/1/1980`, `2/1/1980`, and so on. Is it possible to generate dates that always fall on the beginning of the month?"

        "content": "Yes, you can generate a date range where each date is the first day of every month by adjusting the frequency parameter in the `pd.date_range` function. Instead of using `'M'` which gives you the end of the month, you should use `'MS'` which stands for \"Month Start\". Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndate_range = pd.date_range(start='1/1/1980', end='11/1/1991', freq='MS')\nprint(date_range)\n```\n\nThis will generate a range of dates where each date is the first day of the month, such as `1/1/1980`, `2/1/1980`, `3/1/1980`, and so on, up to `11/1/1991`."
