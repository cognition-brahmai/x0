To make it more challenging, there are obstacles in your way. There is a bookworm that keeps moving books around, a librarian who is asleep at their desk, and a group of noisy students who are studying in the same section as the book you need.\nThe word you are looking for is related to education and is commonly used in schools. You must navigate the obstacles and find the word before the timer runs out. Good luck!"
