I have a string represented as `s = 'sdfjoiweng%@$foo$fsoifjoi'`, and I want to replace the substring `'foo'` with `'bar'`.

        "content": "To replace all instances of a specific substring within a string using regex in Python, you should use the `re.sub()` function correctly. In your case, you want to replace the substring `'foo'` with `'bar'` in the string `s = 'sdfjoiweng%@$foo$fsoifjoi'`.\n\nThe issue with your attempt using `re.sub(r'\\bfoo\\b', 'bar', s)` is that `\\b` is a word boundary anchor which requires `'foo'` to be a standalone word separated by non-word characters (such as spaces, punctuation) or the start/end of the string. Since `'foo'` is part of other characters in your string, the word boundary anchor will not match it.\n\nYour other attempt, `re.sub(r'[foo]', 'bar', s)`, is incorrect because `[foo]` defines a character class, which matches any single character that is either `'f'`, `'o'`, or `'o'`. This is not suitable for replacing the substring `'foo'`.\n\nHere's the correct way to replace `'foo'` with `'bar'`:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ns = 'sdfjoiweng%@$foo$fsoifjoi'\nresult = re.sub(r'foo', 'bar', s)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will correctly replace all instances of `'foo'` with `'bar'`, resulting in the string `'sdfjoiweng%@$bar$fsoifjoi'`. Since you are just replacing a simple substring and not using any special regex features like boundaries, you don't need any additional regex constructs."
