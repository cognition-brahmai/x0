        "content": "To solve this problem, we must first determine which numbers could potentially replace the question mark in the sequence 1, 5, 2, 9, 8, ? to form a perfect square that is also a multiple of 5.\n\nThe sequence is 15298?. Since we want the number to be a multiple of 5, the missing digit (?) must be either 0 or 5 because only numbers ending in 0 or 5 are multiples of 5.\n\nNow let's consider the numbers:\n\n1. **152980**: Check if this is a perfect square.\n   - The number ends in 0, so its square root should end in 0 or 5.\n   - Calculate the approximate square root: \u221a152980 \u2248 391.11 (not an integer, so not a perfect square).\n\n2. **152985**: Check if this is a perfect square.\n   - The number ends in 5, so its square root should end in 5.\n   - Calculate the approximate square root: \u221a152985 \u2248 391.14 (not an integer, so not a perfect square).\n\nSince neither 152980 nor 152985 are perfect squares, let's verify our calculations or see if there might be another approach.\n\nGiven the constraints and calculations, it appears there might not be a straightforward perfect square for this sequence with the given conditions. If this problem has been set as a puzzle or challenge, there might be additional details or context needed to arrive at a different conclusion. However, based on standard arithmetic and constraints, neither substitution results in a perfect square."
