        "content": "In Python, the `%s` symbol is used within a format string to denote a placeholder for a string. It's a part of the string formatting method known as \"old-style\" string formatting or the `%` operator. When used, `%s` is replaced by the string representation of the variable or expression that follows the `%` operator.\n\nLet's break down the provided code snippet:\n\n```python\nif len(sys.argv) < 2:\n     sys.exit('Usage: %s database-name' % sys.argv[0])\n\nif not os.path.exists(sys.argv[1]):\n     sys.exit('ERROR: Database %s was not found!' % sys.argv[1])\n```\n\n1. **`sys.argv`**: This is a list in Python that contains the command-line arguments passed to the script. `sys.argv[0]` is the name of the script itself, and `sys.argv[1]` would be the first argument passed to the script.\n\n2. **`len(sys.argv) < 2`**: This condition checks if fewer than two arguments are passed to the script. If that's the case, it means the script is missing a required argument (in this context, the database name).\n\n3. **`sys.exit('Usage: %s database-name' % sys.argv[0])`**: If the required argument is missing, this line terminates the program and prints a usage message. The `%s` in the string is replaced by `sys.argv[0]` (the script name), indicating to the user how to properly run the script.\n\n4. **`os.path.exists(sys.argv[1])`**: This checks for the existence of the file or directory specified by the first command-line argument (`sys.argv[1]`).\n\n5. **`sys.exit('ERROR: Database %s was not found!' % sys.argv[1])`**: If the file or directory does not exist, this line terminates the program and prints an error message. The `%s` is replaced by `sys.argv[1]`, informing the user that the specified database was not found.\n\nOverall, this code snippet is a basic script that expects a database name as a command-line argument. It checks if the correct number of arguments is provided and whether the specified database exists. If any check fails, it exits with an appropriate message."
