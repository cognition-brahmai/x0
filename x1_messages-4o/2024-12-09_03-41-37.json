However, when attempting to set up a virtual environment using the command `virtualenv ENV`, I receive an ImportError stating \"No module named 'pip'\". I can successfully import pip from a Python shell. Additionally, the virtual environment installs successfully when I use the `--system-site-packages` flag. Can anyone help me understand and resolve this error?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely due to the way `virtualenv` is handling the creation of new environments and its interaction with the installed packages. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Update Virtualenv**: Ensure that you have the latest version of `virtualenv` installed. You can update it using the command:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade virtualenv\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Python and Pip Path**: Make sure that the Python version and Pip you are using are the ones you expect. Sometimes, multiple installations can cause conflicts. You can check the paths using:\n   ```bash\n   python -m site\n   pip --version\n   ```\n\n3. **Recreate Virtual Environment**: Delete the existing virtual environment and try creating a new one. Sometimes starting fresh can resolve these issues:\n   ```bash\n   virtualenv --clear ENV\n   virtualenv ENV\n   ```\n\n4. **Install Pip Manually in the Virtual Environment**: If the issue persists, you can manually install Pip in the virtual environment:\n   - Activate the virtual environment:\n     ```bash\n     ENV\\Scripts\\activate\n     ```\n   - Install Pip:\n     ```bash\n     python -m ensurepip\n     ```\n\n5. **Check Permissions**: Ensure that there are no permission issues preventing `pip` from being copied into the virtual environment. Running your command prompt as an administrator can help alleviate such issues.\n\n6. **Use `--no-site-packages` Flag**: Although using `--system-site-packages` works, it shares the global site-packages with the virtual environment, which might not be ideal. Ensure you are not using this flag unless necessary.\n\n7. **Consider Using Python's Built-In `venv` Module**: If `virtualenv` continues to give you trouble and you are not dependent on its specific features, consider using Python's built-in `venv` module to create virtual environments:\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv ENV\n   ```\n\nIf you've tried all these steps and continue to experience issues, it might be worth checking the `virtualenv` release notes for any known issues with the specific versions you are using or considering reinstalling Python and the associated tools from scratch to ensure a clean setup."
