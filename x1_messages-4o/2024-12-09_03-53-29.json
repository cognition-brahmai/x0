The Anaconda install requires me to preface any python call with \"source activate tensorflow\", and the pip install works well when starting python the standard way (in the terminal), then tensorflow loads properly. However, I am unable to make TensorFlow work in Jupyter notebooks. Can you guide me on how to make TensorFlow work in Jupyter notebooks? Also, it seems that my python kernel in Jupyter/Anaconda is separate from the python kernel used system wide. How can I ensure that if I install a new python library, it becomes accessible to all the varied ways I have of running python?"

        "content": "To ensure TensorFlow works in Jupyter notebooks and to streamline your Python environment setup, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Create a Conda Environment for TensorFlow\n\n1. **Create and activate a new conda environment:**\n\n   ```bash\n   conda create --name tf_env python=3.7\n   conda activate tf_env\n   ```\n\n2. **Install TensorFlow and Jupyter in this environment:**\n\n   ```bash\n   conda install tensorflow\n   conda install jupyter\n   ```\n\n### Step 2: Configure Jupyter to Use the Conda Environment\n\n1. **Install the `ipykernel` package in your conda environment:**\n\n   ```bash\n   conda install ipykernel\n   ```\n\n2. **Add the conda environment as a Jupyter kernel:**\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m ipykernel install --user --name=tf_env --display-name=\"Python (tf_env)\"\n   ```\n\n   This command will make the `tf_env` environment available as a kernel in Jupyter notebooks.\n\n### Step 3: Launch Jupyter and Select the Kernel\n\n1. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**\n\n   ```bash\n   jupyter notebook\n   ```\n\n2. **When creating a new notebook, select the kernel named \"Python (tf_env)\" from the Kernel menu.**\n\n### Making Python Libraries Accessible Globally\n\nTo make Python libraries accessible across various environments:\n\n1. **Use Conda environments consistently:** Conda environments help maintain consistent dependencies, but they are self-contained. If you need a library across environments, you can install it in each environment or manage a shared environment.\n\n2. **Install packages in the base environment (not recommended):** You can install packages in the base Anaconda environment, but this can lead to version conflicts.\n\n3. **Use system-wide installation (not recommended for all packages):** You can install packages system-wide using `pip`, but this may conflict with conda environments.\n\n4. **Create a shared environment if needed:** \n\n   If you require specific packages across different settings, creating a shared environment that you activate when needed allows for consistency without redundancy.\n\nBy following the above steps, you should be able to run TensorFlow in Jupyter notebooks and manage your Python installations more effectively."
