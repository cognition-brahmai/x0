I've noticed that I don't always explicitly close the cursor with `cursor.close()` after I'm done with the database, but this hasn't caused any errors or performance issues so far. Given that `connection` and `cursor` in Django follow \"Python Database API Specification v2.0\" (PEP-249), which implies that the cursor would be automatically closed whenever `__del__()` method is called, I'm wondering what kind of problems could potentially arise if I don't close the cursor explicitly? Is there a use case when `__del__()` is not called? I am using Python 2.7 and Django 1.6.5."

        "content": "When you're working with raw SQL queries in Django using `connection.cursor()`, it's important to understand the implications of not explicitly closing the cursor using `cursor.close()`. Here are potential issues and considerations:\n\n1. **Resource Leakage**: Not explicitly closing cursors can lead to resource leakage. Each open cursor consumes database and system resources. If many cursors remain open, it can exhaust these resources, potentially leading to performance degradation or even failure to open new connections or cursors.\n\n2. **Database Connection Limits**: Most databases have a limit on the number of concurrent connections or cursors. If cursors are not closed, you could hit these limits, which might prevent the application from creating new connections or cursors when needed.\n\n3. **Garbage Collection and `__del__()`**: While it's true that Python's garbage collector will eventually reclaim objects that are no longer in use, relying on `__del__()` to close cursors is not ideal. The timing of garbage collection is non-deterministic, meaning the cursor might remain open longer than necessary, leading to the above issues. In some cases, if there are circular references, the garbage collector may not be able to reclaim the object, preventing `__del__()` from being called.\n\n4. **Explicit Context Management**: Using context managers (`with` statement) is a better approach as it ensures that resources are released as soon as they are no longer needed. Django's database connections and cursors can be managed this way to ensure proper cleanup:\n   ```python\n   with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n       cursor.execute(\"YOUR QUERY HERE\")\n       # Process results\n   # Cursor automatically closed here\n   ```\n\n5. **Behavior in Python 2.7 and Django 1.6.5**: Given that you're using Python 2.7 and Django 1.6.5, you should be particularly mindful because Python 2.7's garbage collection is less sophisticated than newer versions, and Django 1.6.5 is quite outdated, lacking many improvements and optimizations present in later versions.\n\nTo avoid potential issues, it's a good practice to close the cursor explicitly or use context managers to manage database resources efficiently. Even if you haven't experienced issues yet, proactive management of database resources can prevent hard-to-debug problems in the future."
