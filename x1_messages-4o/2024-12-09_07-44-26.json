Currently, I'm doing it like this: \n\n```python\na, b = True, False\n```\n\nBut if I have to declare many more variables, it becomes less elegant. For instance:\n\n```python\na, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j = True, True, True, True, True, False, True ,True , True, True\n```\n\nI'm wondering if there is a more elegant or convenient way to do this. I thought of using a list or a tuple to store the variables, but I'm not sure how to approach this. For example:\n\n```python\naList = [a,b]\n```\n\nThis doesn't seem to be valid. I would have to do:\n\n```python\na, b = True, True\n```\n\nIs there something I'm missing here?"

        "content": "To declare multiple variables in a more elegant way, especially when you're assigning them similar values or managing them as a group, using lists or dictionaries can be quite helpful. Here are a few approaches you might consider:\n\n1. **Using Lists or Tuples:**\n\n   If the order of variables matters and you want to keep them together, you can use a list or tuple. You can then unpack the list or tuple when needed:\n\n   ```python\n   values = [True, True, True, True, True, False, True, True, True, True]\n   a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j = values\n   ```\n\n2. **Using Dictionaries:**\n\n   If you want to associate names with values and possibly refer to them by name rather than position, a dictionary can be useful:\n\n   ```python\n   vars_dict = {\n       'a': True,\n       'b': True,\n       'c': True,\n       'd': True,\n       'e': True,\n       'f': False,\n       'g': True,\n       'h': True,\n       'i': True,\n       'j': True\n   }\n\n   # Access variables by name\n   a = vars_dict['a']\n   b = vars_dict['b']\n   # And so on...\n   ```\n\n3. **Using Default Values with a Loop:**\n\n   If many of the variables share the same value, you can use a loop to assign them:\n\n   ```python\n   variables = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j']\n   values = {var: True for var in variables}\n   values['f'] = False\n\n   # To access\n   a = values['a']\n   b = values['b']\n   ```\n\n4. **Using NamedTuple for a Structured Approach:**\n\n   If you want to treat these variables as attributes of a single entity, you can use `namedtuple` from the `collections` module:\n\n   ```python\n   from collections import namedtuple\n\n   Variables = namedtuple('Variables', 'a b c d e f g h i j')\n   vars_tuple = Variables(True, True, True, True, True, False, True, True, True, True)\n\n   # Accessing\n   print(vars_tuple.a)  # True\n   print(vars_tuple.f)  # False\n   ```\n\nEach of these approaches provides a different way to manage multiple variables, depending on how you want to group them and access them later in your code."
