I have some code written for this purpose, but I am not sure if it is correct or if it will work. Here is what I have so far:\n\n```python\n@login_required\ndef resume(request, applicant_id):\n    #Get the applicant's resume\n    resume = File.objects.get(applicant=applicant_id)\n    fsock = open(resume.location, 'r')\n    response = HttpResponse(fsock, mimetype='application/pdf')\n    return response\n```\n\nIs it possible to show a PDF file in the Django view, and if so, how can it be achieved?"

        "content": "Yes, you can display a PDF file directly in the browser using Django by setting the appropriate `Content-Type` in the HTTP response. However, there are a few issues in your code that need to be addressed:\n\n1. **Use of `mimetype`:** The parameter should be `content_type` instead of `mimetype`.\n2. **File mode:** When opening a binary file like a PDF, you should open the file in binary mode (`'rb'`).\n3. **Security:** Ensure that the file paths are properly validated to avoid any security vulnerabilities.\n4. **File handling:** Make sure to handle file operations properly to avoid resource leaks.\n\nHere's a corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\n@login_required\ndef resume(request, applicant_id):\n    # Get the applicant's resume\n    try:\n        resume = File.objects.get(applicant=applicant_id)\n    except File.DoesNotExist:\n        return HttpResponseNotFound(\"Resume not found.\")\n\n    # Open the resume file in binary mode\n    try:\n        with open(resume.location, 'rb') as fsock:\n            response = HttpResponse(fsock.read(), content_type='application/pdf')\n            response['Content-Disposition'] = 'inline; filename=\"resume.pdf\"'\n            return response\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        return HttpResponseNotFound(\"File not found on the server.\")\n\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **`content_type`** is used to set the MIME type correctly.\n- **`Content-Disposition: inline`** instructs the browser to display the file inline, i.e., in the browser window, rather than prompting a download.\n- **Exception Handling:** Added exception handling to ensure the code handles scenarios where the file or applicant does not exist.\n\nMake sure that the file path stored in `resume.location` is correct and points to a valid file on the server. Adjust the file path and access method as needed based on your actual file storage setup."
