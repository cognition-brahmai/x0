        "content": "Creating a ranking system for smartphones based on their value for money involves several steps. You'll need to normalize the features, weigh them according to their importance, and then calculate a score for each smartphone. You can then rank them based on this score. \n\n### Step 1: Normalize Features\nTo compare different features, you need to normalize them. This means scaling them so they can be compared directly. For simplicity, let's use min-max normalization.\n\n### Step 2: Define Weights\nAssign weights to each feature based on how much you think they contribute to the value for money. You can adjust these weights based on user preference or market research.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Score\nCombine the normalized features and weights to calculate a score for each smartphone.\n\n### Step 4: Adjust for Brand Perception\nIntroduce a brand perception multiplier that adjusts the score based on the perceived value of the brand.\n\n### Step 5: Create a Scatter Plot\nUse a library like Chart.js to plot the relationship between price and value for money.\n\nHere's a sample code to demonstrate the ranking system and scatter plot:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Smartphone Ranking</title>\n    <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js\"></script>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Smartphone Value for Money Ranking</h1>\n    <canvas id=\"scatterPlot\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\"></canvas>\n\n    <script>\n        // Sample dataset\n        const smartphones = [\n            { brand: 'BrandA', price: 500, screenSize: 6.1, cameraResolution: 12, batteryLife: 24, storage: 128 },\n            { brand: 'BrandB', price: 700, screenSize: 6.5, cameraResolution: 48, batteryLife: 20, storage: 256 },\n            { brand: 'BrandC', price: 300, screenSize: 5.5, cameraResolution: 8, batteryLife: 30, storage: 64 }\n        ];\n\n        // Brand perception scores\n        const brandPerception = {\n            'BrandA': 1.1,\n            'BrandB': 1.2,\n            'BrandC': 0.9\n        };\n\n        // Weights for features\n        const weights = {\n            screenSize: 0.2,\n            cameraResolution: 0.3,\n            batteryLife: 0.3,\n            storage: 0.2\n        };\n\n        // Normalization function\n        function normalize(featureValues) {\n            const min = Math.min(...featureValues);\n            const max = Math.max(...featureValues);\n            return featureValues.map(value => (value -

Adjust these weights to reflect the relative importance of each feature.\n3. **Brand Perception**: The score is adjusted by a brand perception multiplier. Higher values indicate a more favorable perception.\n4. **Scatter Plot**: The scatter plot visualizes the relationship between price and the calculated value for money score.\n\nYou can adjust the datasets, weights, and brand perception scores as needed to better fit your data and use case."
