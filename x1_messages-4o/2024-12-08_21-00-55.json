        "content": "To calculate the total cost for the round-trip flight, we need to consider several components: the base ticket price for adults and children, additional luggage fees for children, and the mandatory donation. However, as I don't have access to real-time flight pricing, I'll provide a general method for calculating the total cost based on hypothetical prices.\n\n1. **Base Ticket Prices:**\n   - Assume the average round-trip ticket price from New York City during the holiday season is $500 for an adult and $400 for a child.\n\n   Total cost for 2 adults: \\(2 \\times 500 = 1000\\)\n   \n   Total cost for 3 children: \\(3 \\times 400 = 1200\\)\n\n2. **Luggage Fees:**\n   - $50 per child for additional luggage.\n\n   Total luggage fees for 3 children: \\(3 \\times 50 = 150\\)\n\n3. **Donation:**\n   - A mandatory $10 donation for each passenger.\n\n   Total donation for 5 passengers: \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\)\n\n4. **Total Cost:**\n   - Add up all the costs: \\(1000 + 1200 + 150 + 50 = 2400\\)\n\nTherefore, the total estimated cost for the round-trip flight for the group of 5 passengers, including all additional fees and donations, would be $2,400. Please note that actual prices may vary based on airline, booking time, and other factors."
