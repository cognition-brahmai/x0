Look for the information in the first line, which typically includes whether it's a 32-bit or 64-bit version. You should see something like `MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)` or similar.\n\n5. **Check Anaconda Distribution Version:**\n   - To check the Anaconda distribution version, you can also use:\n     ```\n     conda list anaconda$\n     ```\n   - This will show the specific version of the Anaconda distribution package installed.\n\nBy following these steps, you should have a clear understanding of the version of Anaconda, the Python version it includes, and whether it's running on a 32-bit or 64-bit architecture. If you find that your version is not the latest and you want to update it, you can use the following command in the Anaconda Prompt:\n```\nconda update conda\nconda update anaconda\n```\nThis will update both conda itself and the Anaconda distribution to the latest versions available."
