        "content": "I am programming with nVidia's CUDA C using Visual Studio 2008. My program consists of a header file (stuff.h), a C source file (stuff.c), and a CUDA C file (main.cu). The helper functions defined in stuff.h and implemented in stuff.c are called from main.cu. I am using the Cuda.rules from nVidia's GPU Computing SDK and though everything compiles correctly, I am encountering linking problems. The functions defined in stuff.h are not linked correctly and are flagged as \"unresolved external symbols\". After changing the extension of the stuff implementation file from .c to .cpp, the program compiles correctly. I am curious as to why this occurs as I'd prefer to keep everything as a .c file instead of .cpp, since this is meant to be C code. Can you explain why this is happening and suggest a way to resolve this?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to the differences in how C and C++ handle function names (name mangling) and linking.\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Name Mangling**: C++ compilers use a technique called name mangling, which encodes additional information (like function parameters) into the function names to support function overloading. C, on the other hand, doesn't support function overloading and uses the function names directly.\n\n2. **Linking Between C and C++**: When you compile a file as C++ (e.g., `stuff.cpp`), the functions are name-mangled. If your CUDA code (`main.cu`) is being compiled in a way that expects C++ linkage, it will expect the mangled names. However, when `stuff.c` is compiled as C, it doesn't mangle the names, leading to \"unresolved external symbols\" during linking.\n\n### Solution:\nTo resolve this issue while keeping your code as C, you need to ensure that the C functions are treated with C linkage when used in C++ or CUDA code. You can do this by using `extern \"C\"` in your header file. Here's how you can modify `stuff.h`:\n\n```c\n#ifdef __cplusplus\nextern \"C\" {\n#endif\n\n// Your function prototypes here\nvoid yourFunction1();\nvoid yourFunction2();\n\n#ifdef __cplusplus\n}\n#endif\n```\n\n### Explanation of Solution:\n- **`extern \"C\"`**: This tells the C++ compiler to use C linkage for the specified functions, thus avoiding name mangling for them. This way, when your CUDA code calls these functions, it uses the correct (unmangled) names.\n\nBy wrapping your C function declarations in `extern \"C\"` when they are included in C++ (or CUDA) code, you ensure that the correct linking occurs, allowing your project to compile and link without changing the file extensions or the language of your code.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- Ensure that your build system is correctly invoking the C compiler for `stuff.c` and the CUDA compiler for `main.cu`.\n- Check that all necessary paths and libraries are correctly set up in your Visual Studio project.\n- Ensure your project settings are not forcing C++ compilation on your C files inadvertently."
