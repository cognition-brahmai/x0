I have tried to implement it as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Generator\n\ndef generate() -> Generator[int, None, None]:\n    for i in range(10):\n        yield i\n\nfor i in generate():\n    print(i)\n```\n\nHowever, PyCharm gives me an error stating \"Expected 'collections.Iterable', got 'Generator[int, None, None]' instead less... (\u2318F1)\". I am using the latest version of PyCharm Community Edition 2016.3.2 and have imported `typing.Generator`. The code runs correctly, but PyCharm still considers it an error. Is this an actual error or an unsupported feature in PyCharm?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with PyCharm is not due to an error in your code, but rather a limitation or inconsistency in the static analysis performed by the IDE, especially in earlier versions. Your use of type hinting for a generator is correct according to PEP 484.\n\nHere's a breakdown of your code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Generator\n\ndef generate() -> Generator[int, None, None]:\n    for i in range(10):\n        yield i\n\nfor i in generate():\n    print(i)\n```\n\nLet's examine the `Generator` type hint:\n\n- `Generator[int, None, None]`: This indicates that the generator will yield values of type `int`. The `None` in the second position indicates that the generator does not expect to receive any values (as it would with `send()`), and the third `None` indicates that the generator will not return a value (as it would with a `return` statement in a generator).\n\nYour code is compliant with PEP 484. Here are a few steps you can take to address the issue in PyCharm:\n\n1. **Upgrade PyCharm**: Since you're using an older version of PyCharm (2016.3.2), updating to the latest version may resolve the issue, as newer versions have improved support for type hinting.\n\n2. **Check Python Version**: Ensure that your Python interpreter in PyCharm is set to a version that supports type hinting (Python 3.5+).\n\n3. **Invalidate Caches/Restart**: Sometimes, PyCharm's caches can cause issues. Go to `File -> Invalidate Caches / Restart...` and select `Invalidate and Restart`.\n\n4. **Inspect Settings**: Ensure that your type hinting settings in PyCharm are correctly configured. Go to `Preferences -> Editor -> Inspections` and check the configuration for Python type hinting.\n\nIf these steps do not resolve the issue and your code runs without problems, you can consider it a false positive from the static analysis tool. This is not uncommon with static analysis tools, particularly in older versions. If upgrading or reconfiguring PyCharm does not help, you can safely ignore the warning as your code is correctly using type hints."
