I have reinstalled my Ubuntu multiple times to resolve this. How can I correctly install CUDA for my NVIDIA driver?"

        "content": "To successfully install CUDA on your Ubuntu 14.04 system with the NVIDIA driver version 304.125, you'll need to ensure compatibility between the CUDA toolkit, your NVIDIA driver, and your system's GCC version. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Compatibility:**\n   - The NVIDIA driver version 304.125 is quite old, which limits the CUDA versions you can install. In general, CUDA 7.0 requires at least NVIDIA driver version 340.x. Thus, you need to either downgrade the CUDA version or upgrade the NVIDIA driver.\n\n2. **Upgrade NVIDIA Driver:**\n   - Consider upgrading your NVIDIA driver to a more recent version that supports CUDA 7.0 or higher. You can download the latest compatible driver for your GPU from the [NVIDIA Driver Downloads](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) page. Follow the installation instructions carefully.\n\n3. **Install Compatible CUDA Version:**\n   - If upgrading the driver is not an option, you could try installing an older version of CUDA that is compatible with your current driver. You can find older CUDA toolkit versions on the [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit Archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive). Based on your current driver, CUDA 5.5 might be a better fit, but always check the release notes for compatibility details.\n\n4. **Installation Steps:**\n   - **Remove Previous CUDA Installations:** Make sure you completely remove any previously installed CUDA versions to prevent conflicts.\n   - **Download the Compatible CUDA Toolkit:** Download the `.run` file for the CUDA version that matches your driver version.\n   - **Install CUDA Toolkit:** Run the installer and follow the prompts. You might need to install specific dependencies or make compatibility adjustments based on your system configuration.\n   - **Set Environment Variables:** Add CUDA to your PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH in your `.bashrc` file:\n     ```bash\n     export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}\n     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}\n     ```\n   - **Reboot Your System:** Reboot to ensure all changes take effect.\n\n5. **Verify Installation:**\n   - Run the `deviceQuery` and `bandwidthTest` samples provided in the CUDA Toolkit to verify that the installation is successful.\n\n6. **Alternative Solutions:**\n   - If you continue to face issues, consider using a virtual machine or container with a more recent Ubuntu version and a compatible driver and CUDA setup, especially if hardware upgrade options are limited.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to set up CUDA on your Ubuntu 14.04 system. Remember to test your installation thoroughly to ensure everything is working correctly."
