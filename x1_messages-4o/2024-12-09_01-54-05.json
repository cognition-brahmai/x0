        "content": "To import the `nib` module from within the `life` module without modifying `sys.path`, you can make use of relative imports. Since you are using Python 2.5, relative imports are supported, but you need to use them carefully because they can sometimes be tricky in Python 2.x versions.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Inside your `life.py`, you can use a relative import to access the `nib` module. Since `nib.py` is in the parent directory of `life.py`, you can use a relative import as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom ... import nib\n```\n\n2. Make sure that each directory (including `ptdraft`, `simulations`, and `life`) contains an `__init__.py` file. This is necessary for Python to recognize the directories as packages and allow relative imports.\n\n3. Ensure that you are running your script from the `ptdraft` directory. This is crucial because the relative import assumes the script is executed in a way that the package structure is respected.\n\nBy using relative imports, you avoid modifying `sys.path` and keep your code clean and organized within the package structure. However, note that relative imports can be a bit tricky in Python 2, so if you encounter any issues, consider upgrading to Python 3, where relative imports are more robust and intuitive."
