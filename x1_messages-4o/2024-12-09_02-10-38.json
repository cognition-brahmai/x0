I already know how to return a boolean value if a list contains an element that partially matches a certain string, like the example below:\n\n```python\nl = ['ones', 'twos', 'threes']\nwanted = 'three'\nany(s.startswith(wanted) for s in l)\n```\n\nThis will return `True` if there's a match. However, I want to return the element itself (in this case, 'threes') instead of a `True` or `False`. How can I modify my code to achieve this?"

        "content": "To modify your code so that it returns the element itself instead of a `True` or `False`, you can use a generator expression with the `next()` function. This way, you can iterate through the list and return the first element that matches the condition. If no match is found, you can return `None` or any other default value you prefer. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nl = ['ones', 'twos', 'threes']\nwanted = 'three'\n\n# Use next with a generator expression to find the element\nresult = next((s for s in l if s.startswith(wanted)), None)\n\nprint(result)  # This will print 'threes' if a match is found, or None if not\n```\n\nIn this code, `next()` retrieves the first element from the generator expression that satisfies the condition `s.startswith(wanted)`. If no such element is found, it returns `None` by default (or you can specify another default value)."
