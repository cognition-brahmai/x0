I have two data frames; one containing numeric training data and the other containing test data. I want to draw a decision boundary around the results obtained from the `knn` function. How can I achieve this? Also, I need to replicate my findings on a machine with restricted access to 3rd party libraries. Below is the code I've used:\n\n```R\nlibrary(class)\n\nn <- 100\n\nset.seed(1)\nx <- round(runif(n, 1, n))\nset.seed(2)\ny <- round(runif(n, 1, n))\ntrain.df <- data.frame(x, y)\n\nset.seed(1)\nx.test <- round(runif(n, 1, n))\nset.seed(2)\ny.test <- round(runif(n, 1, n))\ntest.df <- data.frame(x.test, y.test)\n\nk <- knn(train.df, test.df, classes, k=25)\n\nplot(test.df, col=k)\n```\n\n`classes` is a vector of class labels determined from an earlier part of my code."

        "content": "To draw a decision boundary around the results obtained from the `knn` function in R, you can use a visualization technique that involves predicting the class for a grid of points covering the feature space. By plotting these predictions, you can identify the regions belonging to each class, effectively visualizing the decision boundary. However, since you have restrictions on using 3rd party libraries on another machine, I'll provide an approach using base R functions.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n1. **Create a grid of points** over the range of your feature space.\n2. **Predict the class** for each point in the grid using the `knn` function.\n3. **Plot the grid** with colors corresponding to the predicted classes.\n4. **Overlay the test data** with the actual predictions.\n\nModify your code as follows:\n\n```r\n# Assuming 'classes' is defined somewhere in your code\n# Define a grid over the feature space\nx.range <- seq(min(train.df$x, test.df$x), max(train.df$x, test.df$x), by=1)\ny.range <- seq(min(train.df$y, test.df$y), max(train.df$y, test.df$y), by=1)\ngrid <- expand.grid(x = x.range, y = y.range)\n\n# Predict class for each point in the grid\ngrid.pred <- knn(train.df, grid, classes, k=25)\n\n# Plot the decision boundary\nplot(grid, col = ifelse(grid.pred == \"orange\", \"orange\", \"blue\"), pch = 20, cex = 0.5)\npoints(test.df, col = ifelse(k == \"orange\", \"orange\", \"blue\"), pch = 19)\n\n# Overlay training points\npoints(train.df, col = ifelse(classes == \"orange\", \"orange\", \"blue\"), pch = 4, cex = 1.5)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Grid Creation**: `expand.grid()` creates a grid of points over the specified ranges of `x` and `y`.\n- **Prediction**: The `knn` function is used to predict the class for each point in the grid.\n- **Plotting**: The grid points are plotted with colors representing the predicted classes, providing a visual representation of the decision boundary. The test and training points are overlaid for reference.\n\nThis approach uses only base R functions, ensuring compatibility with environments where 3rd party libraries cannot be installed."
