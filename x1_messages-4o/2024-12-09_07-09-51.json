However, I'm unable to locate these instructions again. Can anyone guide me on how to make this change?"

        "content": "In Python, the interactive prompt is typically controlled by the `sys.ps1` and `sys.ps2` variables. By default, `sys.ps1` is set to `'>>>'` and `sys.ps2` is set to `'...'` (used for continuation lines). You can change these variables to modify the prompt.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. Start the Python interactive shell.\n2. Import the `sys` module.\n3. Change the `sys.ps1` and `sys.ps2` variables to your desired prompt strings.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Change the primary prompt\nsys.ps1 = 'custom-prompt> '\n\n# Change the secondary prompt (for continuation lines)\nsys.ps2 = 'cont> '\n```\n\nAfter setting these variables, the prompt will change immediately. Keep in mind that these changes will only persist for the current session. If you restart the Python shell, the prompts will revert to their default values. If you want to make these changes permanent, you could add the above code to your Python startup file (like `.pythonrc.py`), which Python executes every time it starts an interactive session."
