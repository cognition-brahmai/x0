I downloaded pycrypto-2.6, extracted it, and ran the command `python setup.py build`. However, I am running into a fatal error during the build process. The error message is as follows:\n\n```\nwarning: GMP or MPIR library not found; Not building Crypto.PublicKey._fastmath.\nbuilding 'Crypto.Hash._MD2' extension\ngcc -pthread -fno-strict-aliasing -fwrapv -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -fPIC -std=c99 -O3 - fomit-frame-pointer -Isrc/ -I/usr/include/python2.7 -c src/MD2.c -o build/temp.linux-i686-?2.7/src/MD2.o\nsrc/MD2.c:31:20: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory\ncompilation terminated.\nerror: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1\n```\n\nI would appreciate any help on how to successfully install PyCrypto without this error."

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the missing Python development headers, specifically `Python.h`. This is a common issue when building Python extensions from source. Here's how you can resolve this issue on both Ubuntu and Windows:\n\n### On Ubuntu:\n\n1. **Install Python Development Headers:**\n   You need to install the Python development package for your version of Python. If you're using Python 2.7, run the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install python-dev\n   ```\n\n   If you're using Python 3.x, replace `python-dev` with `python3-dev`:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install python3-dev\n   ```\n\n2. **Install PyCrypto using pip:**\n   After installing the development headers, try installing PyCrypto using pip, which can handle the build process for you:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pycrypto\n   ```\n\n   If you're using Python 3, make sure to use `pip3`:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip3 install pycrypto\n   ```\n\n### On Windows:\n\n1. **Install a C Compiler:**\n   Ensure you have a C compiler installed. You can use Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools, which can be downloaded from the official Microsoft website.\n\n2. **Install PyCrypto using pip:**\n   Use pip to install PyCrypto, as it will handle the compilation for you:\n\n   Open the command prompt and run:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pycrypto\n   ```\n\n   If you encounter issues with this, consider using `pycryptodome` as an alternative, which is a more maintained fork of `pycrypto`:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pycryptodome\n   ```\n\n3. **Alternative with Pre-built Binaries:**\n   Alternatively, you can download pre-built binaries for Windows from websites like [Gohlke's Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/). Download the appropriate `.whl` file for your Python version and architecture, then install it using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install path_to_downloaded_whl_file\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error and successfully install PyCrypto or its alternative on both Ubuntu and Windows systems."
