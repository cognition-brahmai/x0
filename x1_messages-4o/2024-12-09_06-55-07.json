From what I understand, this issue arises when a session isn't closed. However, I am not sure if this applies to my code. Specifically, I connect to the database in the init.py file and then in another Python file, I collect some data using two functions that use the DBSession that was initialized in the init.py file. Additionally, the session variables are created in a particular way. Given this, how do I manage the pool size or at what point should I be closing the session?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering indicates that your application is trying to acquire more database connections than are available in the connection pool. This typically happens when sessions are not properly closed or released back to the pool. Here's how you can manage the connection pool size and ensure sessions are closed appropriately:\n\n### Managing Connection Pool Size\n\n1. **Increase Pool Size**: If your application needs more concurrent connections than the default, you can increase the pool size by configuring `create_engine` with `pool_size` and `max_overflow` parameters. For example:\n   ```python\n   from sqlalchemy import create_engine\n\n   engine = create_engine(\n       'your_database_url',\n       pool_size=10,  # default is 5\n       max_overflow=20,  # default is 10\n       pool_timeout=30  # default is 30 seconds\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. **Adjust Timeout**: You can adjust `pool_timeout` to a higher value if your operations are expected to take longer.\n\n### Proper Session Management\n\n1. **Context Managers**: Use context managers to ensure that sessions are always closed, even if an error occurs. This can be done using `sessionmaker` to create session objects:\n   ```python\n   from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\n\n   Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\n\n   # Usage in your functions\n   def get_data():\n       with Session() as session:\n           # perform database operations\n           pass  # session is automatically closed here\n   ```\n\n2. **Explicit Session Closing**: If you're not using context managers, ensure that you explicitly close sessions:\n   ```python\n   session = Session()\n   try:\n       # perform database operations\n       pass\n   finally:\n       session.close()  # ensure the session is closed\n   ```\n\n3. **Session Removal in Web Applications**: If you're using a web framework, you might want to manage sessions per request. For example, in Flask, you can use the `teardown_appcontext` decorator to remove sessions:\n   ```python\n   from flask import Flask\n\n   app = Flask(__name__)\n\n   @app.teardown_appcontext\n   def shutdown_session(exception=None):\n       Session.remove()\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Leaks**: Ensure that all code paths properly close sessions. Look for any exceptions or early returns that might skip session closure.\n\n### Debugging\n\n- **Monitor Connections**: Use database tools to monitor the number of active connections and see if they align with your expectations.\n- **Logging**: Enable SQLAlchemy logging to track session and connection activity.\n\nBy properly managing your sessions and adjusting the pool settings, you should be able to resolve the `QueuePool` limit error and ensure optimal database performance."
