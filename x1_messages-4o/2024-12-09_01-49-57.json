My code is:\n\n```python\nimport pickle\nimport gzip\nimport numpy\n\nwith gzip.open('mnist.pkl.gz', 'rb') as f:\n    l = list(pickle.load(f))\n    print(l)\n```\n\nHowever, I am getting the following error:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n   File \"mnist.py\", line 7, in &lt;module&gt;\n     train_set, valid_set, test_set = pickle.load(f)\nUnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0x90 in position 614: ordinal not in range(128)\n```\n\nI tried to decode the pickled file in Python 2.7 and re-encode it with protocol 2 and 0:\n```python\nimport pickle\nimport gzip\nimport numpy\n\nwith gzip.open('mnist.pkl.gz', 'rb') as f:\n    train_set, valid_set, test_set = pickle.load(f)\n\n    with gzip.open('mnistx.pkl.gz', 'wb') as g:\n        pickle.dump(\n            (train_set, valid_set, test_set),\n            g,\n            protocol=2)\n```\nIt runs without error in Python 2.7, but when I try to load the re-encoded file in Python 3.2, I still get the same error. What do I need to do to get this to work in Python 3.2?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to differences in the default string encoding between Python 2 and Python 3. In Python 3, strings are Unicode by default, and the `pickle` module attempts to decode byte streams using ASCII, which can lead to the `UnicodeDecodeError`.\n\nTo address this issue, you can explicitly specify the encoding when loading the pickled file in Python 3.2. Here's a modified version of your code that should work:\n\n```python\nimport pickle\nimport gzip\nimport numpy\n\nwith gzip.open('mnist.pkl.gz', 'rb') as f:\n    # Specify encoding='latin1' to handle the byte stream correctly\n    train_set, valid_set, test_set = pickle.load(f, encoding='latin1')\n    print(train_set, valid_set, test_set)\n```\n\nUsing `encoding='latin1'` ensures that the byte stream is interpreted correctly, as it maps each byte to the corresponding Unicode code point, which preserves the byte data exactly.\n\nIf you have already re-encoded the file using protocol 2, you should be able to load it in Python 3.2 with the above modification. If you still face issues, ensure that the file paths and file handling operations are correctly set up and that the file isn't corrupted.\n\nIf you continue to encounter errors, consider using a more recent version of Python if possible, as Python 3.2 is quite outdated, and later versions have improved compatibility and features."
