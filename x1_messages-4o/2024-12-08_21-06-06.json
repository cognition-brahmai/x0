Below is an example of how you could write this Ruby script:\n\n```ruby\n# Ruby script to generate a random math problem in LaTeX format\n\n# Define the words to be used\nnouns = [\"equation\", \"variable\", \"solution\"]\n\n# Randomly select numbers and assign them to variables\nrandom_number = rand(1..10)\n\n# Create the LaTeX formatted problem\ndef generate_problem(nouns, random_number)\n  # Assign nouns to parts of the template\n  noun1 = nouns[0]  # equation\n  noun2 = nouns[1]  # variable\n  noun3 = nouns[2]  # solution\n\n  # LaTeX formatted problem statement\n  problem = \"Solve the \\\\textbf{#{noun1}}, where \\\\textbf{#{noun2}} = #{random_number}, for \\\\textbf{#{noun3}}.\"\n\n  return problem\nend\n\n# Generate and print the math problem\nputs generate_problem(nouns, random_number)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Nouns Array**: An array `nouns` is defined to store the words \"equation,\" \"variable,\" and \"solution.\"\n- **Random Number**: A random number between 1 and 10 is generated and stored in the variable `random_number`.\n- **`generate_problem` Method**: This method constructs the problem statement using the provided nouns and random number, and formats it using LaTeX.\n- **Output**: The LaTeX formatted problem statement is generated and printed.\n\nThis script will generate a LaTeX formatted math problem each time it is run, using the template you provided. Feel free to modify the range of numbers or the nouns to customize your problem further."
