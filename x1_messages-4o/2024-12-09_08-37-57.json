I have tried the following code, but instead of receiving the expected Fibonacci numbers, I'm getting a generator object. Why is the value of `self.a` not being printed as a Fibonacci number? How can I write a `unittest` for this generator?\n\n```python\nclass Fib:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.a, self.b = 0, 1\n\n    def __next__(self):\n        yield self.a\n        self.a, self.b = self.b, self.a+self.b\n\nf = Fib()\n\nfor i in range(3):\n    print(next(f))\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```python\n<generator object __next__ at 0x000000000A3E4F68>\n<generator object __next__ at 0x000000000A3E4F68>\n<generator object __next__ at 0x000000000A3E4F68>\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the misuse of the `yield` statement within the `__next__` method. The `yield` statement makes a function a generator, and when you call `next()`, it returns a generator object instead of the value. To fix this, you should implement a method that acts as a generator and a separate method to handle iteration. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nclass Fib:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.a, self.b = 0, 1\n\n    def __iter__(self):\n        return self\n\n    def __next__(self):\n        current = self.a\n        self.a, self.b = self.b, self.a + self.b\n        return current\n\n# Instantiate the Fibonacci generator\nf = Fib()\n\nfor i in range(3):\n    print(next(f))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n0\n1\n1\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `__iter__` method returns the instance itself, which is standard for Python iterators.\n- The `__next__` method performs the Fibonacci calculation, updating the instance variables and returning the current value.\n\n### Writing a `unittest` for the Fibonacci Generator\n\nYou can create a unit test to verify the behavior of your generator as follows:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\nclass TestFibonacci(unittest.TestCase):\n    def test_fibonacci_sequence(self):\n        f = Fib()\n        expected_sequence = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]\n        result_sequence = [next(f) for _ in range(6)]\n        self.assertEqual(result_sequence, expected_sequence)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Test:\n- The test `test_fibonacci_sequence` checks that the first six numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are generated correctly.\n- `unittest.main()` is used to execute the test when the script runs."
