        "content": "Yes, you can split a string by spaces in JavaScript using the `split()` method. This method divides a string into an array of substrings based on a specified separator. To split a string by spaces, you would use a space character (' ') as the separator. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\nlet str = \"This is a sample string\";\nlet words = str.split(' ');\n\nconsole.log(words);\n```\n\nIn this example, the `split(' ')` method call splits the string `str` into an array of words: `[\"This\", \"is\", \"a\", \"sample\", \"string\"]`. Each word in the string becomes an element in the array."
