I would like to add a new column to this dataframe, that will show the difference between these two dates in years, months, and days format. Currently, when I subtract 'start' from 'end' date, it gives me the difference in days. How can I convert this difference into years, months and days? \n\nHere is my current dataframe:\n\n```python\nName    start        end\nA       2000-01-10   1970-04-29\n```\n\nAnd here is what I attempted:\n\n```python\ndf['diff'] = df['end'] - df['start']\n```\n\nBut the 'diff' column only contains the difference in days, like '10848 days'. I would like to convert this into '29y9m etc.' format."

        "content": "To calculate the difference between two dates in years, months, and days format in a pandas DataFrame, you can use the `relativedelta` function from the `dateutil` library. The `relativedelta` function allows you to calculate date differences in a more human-readable format. Here's how you can achieve your goal:\n\nFirst, ensure you have the `dateutil` library installed. If not, you can install it using:\n\n```bash\npip install python-dateutil\n```\n\nThen, you can use the following code to calculate the difference between the 'start' and 'end' dates in your DataFrame:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta\n\n# Create the DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'Name': ['A'],\n    'start': ['2000-01-10'],\n    'end': ['1970-04-29']\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Convert the 'start' and 'end' columns to datetime\ndf['start'] = pd.to_datetime(df['start'])\ndf['end'] = pd.to_datetime(df['end'])\n\n# Function to calculate the difference in years, months, and days\ndef calculate_diff(row):\n    delta = relativedelta(row['end'], row['start'])\n    return f\"{abs(delta.years)}y{abs(delta.months)}m{abs(delta.days)}d\"\n\n# Apply the function to each row\ndf['diff'] = df.apply(calculate_diff, axis=1)\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThis code will add a new column 'diff' to your DataFrame, showing the difference between the 'start' and 'end' dates in the '29y9mXyd' format, where X is the number of days. Note that the `relativedelta` will handle negative differences gracefully, and the `abs()` function is used to ensure all values are positive in the output format."
