Why is `super()` unable to resolve the superclass at runtime without assistance from the compiler? Also, when I try to rebind `super` to `super_` it fails with a RuntimeError: `super(): __class__ cell not found`. Are there practical situations in which this behaviour, or the underlying reason for it, could potentially cause problems for a programmer? Furthermore, are there any other functions, methods etc. in Python that can be broken by rebinding them to a different name?\n\nHere is the code I've used:\n\n```python\nsuper_ = super\n\nclass A(object):\n    def x(self):\n        print(\"No flipping\")\n\nclass B(A):\n    def x(self):\n        super_().x()\nB().x()\n```\n\nAnd here is the error I'm getting:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 3, in x\nRuntimeError: super(): __class__ cell not found\n```"

        "content": "In Python 3.x, the `super()` function can be called without arguments due to improvements in the language's handling of class and instance references. This is indeed a form of \"magic\" that Python achieves by implicitly capturing the current class and instance when `super()` is called. This magic is made possible by the way Python compiles the class definition into bytecode, creating a special cell variable that holds a reference to the class.\n\n### Why `super()` Needs Compile-Time Assistance\n\nWhen you call `super()` without arguments, Python uses the special cell variable `__class__` to determine the class context in which `super()` was invoked. This special variable is created during the compilation of the class, and it captures the reference to the class itself. Without this mechanism, Python would not be able to resolve the class context automatically at runtime, because it relies on this pre-compiled reference to know which class's method to call.\n\n### The RuntimeError: `__class__ cell not found`\n\nWhen you try to rebind `super` to `super_`, the special `__class__` cell is not correctly bound in the context where `super_()` is called. This is because the cell is specifically associated with the `super()` function, and trying to use a different reference to call super without this context breaks the mechanism. The `super()` function relies on this specific cell to determine the class context.\n\n### Practical Situations and Potential Problems\n\nThis behavior can cause problems if you try to rebind or alias `super` and then use it in a way that loses its context. The specific error arises because `super()` relies on knowing the exact class context it was called in, which is lost when rebinding.\n\nOther situations where similar issues might arise include dynamically generating classes or using decorators that modify class behavior in ways that interfere with the creation of this `__class__` cell.\n\n### Other Functions or Methods with Similar Issues\n\nWhile `super()` is a unique case due to the way it relies on the class context, rebinding built-in functions or methods can generally lead to unexpected behavior or errors, especially if those functions are part of the language\u2019s runtime environment.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Rebinding `print` in Python by assigning it to a different name can lead to confusion or errors if you forget that you've done so.\n- Rebinding built-in types or functions like `list`, `dict`, `int`, etc., can lead to unexpected behavior in your code.\n\nIn general, it's best to avoid rebinding built-in functions or constructs unless there's a compelling reason and you fully understand the implications.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe `super()` function's behavior in Python 3.x is a result of deliberate design choices to simplify the developer experience by providing automatic context resolution. However, this also means that it relies on certain compile-time constructs that should not be tampered with if you want to maintain expected functionality."
