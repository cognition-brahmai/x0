I have the index of a specific column and already know the row index of a certain value. I would like to retrieve the column name of that particular value from my dataframe. I've looked through the documentation and found methods to do the opposite, but not for my specific need."

        "content": "To retrieve the name of a column from its index in a Pandas DataFrame, you can use the `columns` attribute of the DataFrame, which stores the column names as an Index object. You can access the column name by using the index of the column. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Example DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'A': [1, 2, 3],\n    'B': [4, 5, 6],\n    'C': [7, 8, 9]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Example Numpy array (assuming it's derived from the DataFrame)\nnp_array = df.to_numpy()\n\n# Let's say you have the column index and the row index\ncolumn_index = 1  # for column 'B'\nrow_index = 2     # for the value 6\n\n# Retrieve the column name from the column index\ncolumn_name = df.columns[column_index]\n\nprint(f\"The column name at index {column_index} is '{column_name}'.\")\n```\n\nIn this example, `column_index` is the index of the column you're interested in, and `df.columns[column_index]` retrieves the column name. Make sure that the column index is within the range of the DataFrame's columns."
