I am encountering issues while trying to use one class method to return data that is then put in another method. I've attempted using `getattr()` as well, but it doesn't seem to help. Here is the code I am working with:\n\n```python\n#! /bin/python2.6\n\nclass HolyGrail(object):\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.start = 'start_at_init'\n\n    # function definition in question:\n    # TypeError: 'str' object is not callable\n\n    def run_it(self):\n        start = setattr(self, 'name', 'get_thing')\n        start = self.name\n\n        # Something wrong here?\n        value_returned = start() #I believe this == self.get_thing()\n        use_it(value_returned)\n\n    \"\"\"\n    # alternate function definitions\n    # NameError: global name 'start' is not defined\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.start = 'get_thing'\n\n    def run_it(self):\n        go_do_it = getattr(self, start)\n        first_output = go_do_it()\n        use_it(first_output)\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def get_thing(self):\n        return \"The Knights Who Say ... Ni!\"\n\n    def use_it(self, x):\n        print x\n        print \"We want a shrubbery!\"\n\nmy_instance = HolyGrail()\nmy_instance.run_it()\n```"

        "content": "It looks like you're trying to dynamically call a method using `setattr()` and `getattr()`, but there are a few issues in your code. Let me help you fix it and explain how it works.\n\n### Code Explanation and Fix:\n\n1. **`setattr()` Usage**: `setattr()` assigns a value to an object's attribute. In your code, you're using it to set `self.name` to `'get_thing'`, which is correct. However, you're trying to call it as a function later, which causes the error.\n\n2. **Calling Methods Dynamically**: To call a method dynamically, you need to use `getattr()` to retrieve the method and then call it. Note that `getattr()` retrieves the method itself, not its name.\n\n3. **Attribute Error**: The error in your alternate function is due to the variable `start` not being defined. You need to use `self.start` to access the `start` attribute of the instance.\n\nHere's a corrected version of your script:\n\n```python\n#! /bin/python2.6\n\nclass HolyGrail(object):\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.start = 'start_at_init'\n\n    def run_it(self):\n        # Set the attribute 'name' to the method name 'get_thing'\n        setattr(self, 'name', 'get_thing')\n\n        # Use getattr to get the method and call it\n        method_name = self.name\n        method_to_call = getattr(self, method_name)\n        \n        # Call the retrieved method and store its return value\n        value_returned = method_to_call()\n\n        # Use the return value in the use_it method\n        self.use_it(value_returned)\n\n    def get_thing(self):\n        return \"The Knights Who Say ... Ni!\"\n\n    def use_it(self, x):\n        print(x)\n        print(\"We want a shrubbery!\")\n\nmy_instance = HolyGrail()\nmy_instance.run_it()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **`setattr(self, 'name', 'get_thing')`**: This sets `self.name` to the string `'get_thing'`.\n\n2. **`getattr(self, method_name)`**: This gets the method `get_thing` from the instance using the name stored in `self.name`.\n\n3. **Calling the Method**: Once you have the method using `getattr()`, call it by using `method_to_call()`.\n\n4. **Ensure `self.use_it(value_returned)`**: Make sure that you call `use_it()` using `self` to reference the method correctly within the class.\n\nWith these changes, your script should work as expected in Python 2.6."
