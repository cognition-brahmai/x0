The code was working fine a few months ago, but now I'm getting an error, \"AttributeError: 'Sequential' object has no attribute 'predict_classes'\" when trying to make class predictions using the 'predict_classes' method on my Sequential model. I haven't made any changes to the code, could a package update be causing this issue? Here is my code:\n\n```python\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(Dense(24, input_dim=13, activation='relu'))\nmodel.add(Dense(18, activation='relu'))\nmodel.add(Dense(6, activation='softmax'))\nmodel.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])\n\nhistory = model.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size = 256, epochs = 10, verbose = 2, validation_split = 0.2)\n\nscore, acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=2, batch_size= 256)\nprint('test accuracy:', acc)\n\nyhat_classes = model.predict_classes(X_test)\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to changes in the Keras API. The method `predict_classes()` has been deprecated in recent versions of Keras. Instead, you should use `predict()` and then convert the predicted probabilities to class labels. Here's how you can modify your code to work with the updated Keras API:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Assuming your model and data preparation code is already here\n\n# Predict probabilities for test data\nyhat_probs = model.predict(X_test, batch_size=256, verbose=2)\n\n# Convert probabilities to class labels\nyhat_classes = np.argmax(yhat_probs, axis=1)\n\n# Assuming y_test is in one-hot encoded form, convert it to class labels\ny_test_classes = np.argmax(y_test, axis=1)\n\n# Now you can calculate performance metrics\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_recall_fscore_support\n\naccuracy = accuracy_score(y_test_classes, yhat_classes)\nprecision, recall, f1, _ = precision_recall_fscore_support(y_test_classes, yhat_classes, average='weighted')\n\nprint(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')\nprint(f'Precision: {precision}')\nprint(f'Recall: {recall}')\nprint(f'F1 Score: {f1}')\n```\n\nIn this updated code:\n- `model.predict()` is used to obtain the predicted probabilities for each class.\n- `np.argmax()` is used to convert these probabilities into class labels by selecting the index with the highest probability.\n- Performance metrics can then be calculated using these class labels and the true class labels. \n\nMake sure you have the necessary imports for `numpy` and `sklearn` if they are not already present in your code."
