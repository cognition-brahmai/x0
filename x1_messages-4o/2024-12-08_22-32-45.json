C\u00e9zanne is known for his revolutionary approach to painting, which laid the groundwork for the transition from 19th-century Impressionism to the early 20th-century Cubist movement. His exploration of geometric simplification and optical phenomena greatly influenced artists like Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, who are credited with developing Cubism."
