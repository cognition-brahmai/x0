I've encountered a special symbol, the equal sign '=', in the email text that sometimes acts as a hyphenation mark at the end of a text line and other times as an escape mark, similar to '%'. I believe this is related to HTML encoding. How can I handle and understand this equal sign '=' symbol in IMAP email text?"

        "content": "The equal sign `=` you're encountering in the email text is related to a specific encoding format known as \"quoted-printable\". This encoding is often used in emails to ensure that the content remains intact without modification when sent over the internet, especially when dealing with characters outside the standard ASCII range.\n\n### Understanding Quoted-Printable Encoding\n\n1. **Line Breaks and Soft Line Breaks**: \n   - The equal sign `=` at the end of a line is used to indicate a soft line break. This means that the line continues without adding any actual line break in the content. It's simply a way to break long lines in the encoded text.\n\n2. **Hexadecimal Characters**:\n   - When you see an equal sign followed by two hexadecimal digits (e.g., `=20`), it represents a specific character. In this case, `=20` stands for a space character.\n\n### Handling Quoted-Printable Encoding in Python\n\nTo decode quoted-printable encoded text in Python, you can use the `quopri` module, which is part of the standard library. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nimport quopri\n\n# Sample quoted-printable encoded text\nencoded_text = \"This is a test message with special encoding=2E It also has soft line breaks=\\nlike this=2E\"\n\n# Decode the quoted-printable text\ndecoded_text = quopri.decodestring(encoded_text).decode('utf-8')\n\nprint(decoded_text)\n```\n\n### Steps to Process Emails\n\n1. **Fetch the Raw Email Data**: Use `imaplib` to fetch the raw email data from the server.\n\n2. **Decode the Payload**: Extract the email payload and decode it using the appropriate encoding (in this case, quoted-printable).\n\n3. **Handle Different Parts**: If the email contains multiple parts (like text and HTML), you may need to handle each part separately, depending on its content type.\n\nBy understanding and properly decoding quoted-printable encoding, you can accurately process and display the email content as intended by the sender."
