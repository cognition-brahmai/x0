However, I am having some issues. When I send a basic command to my device, it only reads the first line and then gives me an error saying the connection is temporarily unavailable. It does not read the second line. If I change it to blocking mode, it just blocks and never returns. Any thoughts on how to fix this issue? Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nclass Netcat:\n    def __init__(self, hostname, port):\n        self.hostname = hostname\n        self.port = port\n    def send(self, content):\n        self.socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n        self.socket.connect((self.hostname, self.port))\n        self.socket.setblocking(0)\n        result = '';\n        read_ready, write_ready, in_error = select.select([self.socket], [], [self.socket], 5)\n        if(self.socket.sendall(content) != None):\n            return\n        while(1):\n            buffer = ''\n            try:                \n                buffer = self.socket.recv(128)\n                while(buffer != ''):\n                    result += buffer\n                    try:\n                        buffer = self.socket.recv(128)\n                    except socket.error as err:\n                        print (err, type(err))\n                        buffer = ''\n                if(buffer == ''):\n                    break\n            except socket.error as err:\n                print (err, type(err))\n            if(buffer == ''):\n                break\n        return result\n```"

        "content": "The problem you're encountering may be related to how the non-blocking sockets are being handled. Let's go through the code and see what can be improved or fixed.\n\n1. **Non-Blocking Mode**: You're setting the socket to non-blocking mode, which means that operations on the socket that would block (like `recv`) will raise an exception instead. This is why you're getting an error when the data isn't immediately available.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: You're catching `socket.error` exceptions, but the logic inside the `except` block isn't structured to handle the non-blocking nature properly. It simply prints the error and continues, which might not be ideal.\n\n3. **While Loop**: The current logic for receiving data tries to read until `buffer` is empty, but in non-blocking mode, you should handle the `EAGAIN` or `EWOULDBLOCK` errors to retry reading after a short sleep.\n\nHere's a revised version of your code that addresses some of these points:\n\n```python\nimport socket\nimport select\nimport time\nimport errno\n\nclass Netcat:\n    def __init__(self, hostname, port):\n        self.hostname = hostname\n        self.port = port\n\n    def send(self, content):\n        self.socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n        self.socket.connect((self.hostname, self.port))\n        self.socket.setblocking(0)\n\n        # Send data\n        try:\n            self.socket.sendall(content.encode())\n        except socket.error as e:\n            print(f\"Send error: {e}\")\n            return\n\n        # Receive data\n        result = ''\n        while True:\n            try:\n                read_ready, _, _ = select.select([self.socket], [], [], 5)\n                if read_ready:\n                    buffer = self.socket.recv(128).decode()\n                    if buffer:\n                        result += buffer\n                    else:\n                        break  # No more data, exit loop\n            except socket.error as e:\n                if e.errno in (errno.EAGAIN, errno.EWOULDBLOCK):\n                    time.sleep(0.1)  # Wait for a short period before retrying\n                    continue\n                else:\n                    print(f\"Recv error: {e}\")\n                    break\n\n        self.socket.close()\n        return result\n\n# Example usage:\n# nc = Netcat('localhost', 12345)\n# response = nc.send('your command\\n')\n# print(response)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- **Encoding and Decoding**: Ensure that when sending strings, they are encoded to `bytes` and received data is decoded back to `str`.\n- **Error Handling**: Added checks for `EAGAIN` and `EWOULDBLOCK` to retry reading after a short sleep.\n- **Socket Closure**: Ensure the socket is closed after the operation to free resources.\n\nThis should make your implementation more robust and handle non-blocking socket operations more effectively. Adjust the sleep duration or buffer size as needed based on your specific use case and network conditions."
