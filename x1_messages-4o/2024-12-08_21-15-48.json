In order to make informed decisions about our impact on the environment, we need to have a clear understanding of the carbon emissions associated with our actions.\nTo that end, let's say we have a small town with a population of 1000 people. The town has two main sources of energy: a coal-fired power plant and a wind farm. The power plant generates 1000 tons of CO2 per year, while the wind farm generates 200 tons of CO2 per year. The town also produces 500 tons of waste per year, which is sent to a landfill site. Finally, the town's transportation system produces 3000 tons of CO2 per year.\nNow, let's assume that we want to reduce the town's carbon footprint by 50%. How much would we need to reduce emissions from each source? Write a program in Ruby that takes the above data as input and outputs the necessary reductions in CO2 emissions from each source to meet the target.\nHint: To calculate the percentage reduction required for each source, you need to know the total carbon emissions of the town."

        "content": "To achieve the goal of reducing the town's carbon footprint by 50%, we first need to calculate the total carbon emissions of the town and then determine the required reductions from each source. Let's break down the process and write a Ruby program to perform these calculations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Emissions:**\n   - Coal-fired power plant emissions: 1000 tons of CO2 per year\n   - Wind farm emissions: 200 tons of CO2 per year\n   - Waste emissions: 0 tons (assuming waste doesn't emit CO2 directly, or you may consider indirect emissions)\n   - Transportation emissions: 3000 tons of CO2 per year\n\n   Total emissions = 1000 (coal) + 200 (wind) + 0 (waste) + 3000 (transportation) = 4200 tons of CO2 per year\n\n2. **Calculate Target Emissions:**\n   - Target reduction: 50%\n   - Target emissions = Total emissions * (1 - Target reduction)\n   - Target emissions = 4200 * 0.5 = 2100 tons of CO2 per year\n\n3. **Calculate Required Reductions:**\n   - Required reduction = Total emissions - Target emissions\n   - Required reduction = 4200 - 2100 = 2100 tons of CO2 per year\n\n### Ruby Program:\n\n```ruby\ndef calculate_reductions(coal_emissions, wind_emissions, transportation_emissions, reduction_target)\n  total_emissions = coal_emissions + wind_emissions + transportation_emissions\n  target_emissions = total_emissions * (1 - reduction_target)\n  required_reduction = total_emissions - target_emissions\n\n  coal_reduction = coal_emissions * reduction_target\n  wind_reduction = wind_emissions * reduction_target\n  transportation_reduction = transportation_emissions * reduction_target\n\n  {\n    total_emissions: total_emissions,\n    target_emissions: target_emissions,\n    required_reduction: required_reduction,\n    coal_reduction: coal_reduction,\n    wind_reduction: wind_reduction,\n    transportation_reduction: transportation_reduction\n  }\nend\n\n# Input data\ncoal_emissions = 1000\nwind_emissions = 200\ntransportation_emissions = 3000\nreduction_target = 0.50\n\n# Calculate reductions\nreductions = calculate_reductions(coal_emissions, wind_emissions, transportation_emissions, reduction_target)\n\n# Output the results\nputs \"Total Emissions: #{reductions[:total_emissions]} tons of CO2 per year\"\nputs \"Target Emissions: #{reductions[:target_emissions]} tons of CO2 per year\"\nputs \"Required Reduction: #{reductions[:required_reduction]} tons of CO2 per year\"\nputs \"Coal Reduction: #{reductions[:coal_reduction]} tons of CO2 per year\"\nputs \"Wind Reduction: #{reductions[:wind_reduction]} tons of CO2 per year\"\nputs \"Transportation Reduction: #{reductions[:transportation_reduction]} tons of CO2 per year\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The program calculates the total emissions for the town.\n- It then computes the target emissions, which is 50% of the total emissions.\n- The program calculates how much needs to be reduced in total and how much each source should reduce based on the target reduction percentage.\n- The output provides a breakdown of the reductions needed from each source to meet the town's overall carbon reduction goal. \n\nThis program assumes a uniform reduction across all sources. Depending on policy or technological advancements, you might choose to prioritize reductions from specific sources."
