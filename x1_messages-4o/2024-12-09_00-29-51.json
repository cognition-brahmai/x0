I understand that .loc() is only label based and .iloc() is only integer based. Considering this, I want to know why should I ever use .loc() and .iloc() if .ix() is faster and supports both integer and label access?"

        "content": "It's great that you're diving into the pandas library with your background in R! Your understanding of `.loc[]` and `.iloc[]` is correct: `.loc[]` is used for label-based indexing, while `.iloc[]` is used for integer-based indexing.\n\nRegarding your question about `.ix[]`, it's important to note that `.ix[]` was deprecated in pandas version 0.20.0 and removed in later versions. The reason for this deprecation was to reduce the confusion and potential issues that arise from its dual-purpose nature. `.ix[]` could indeed handle both label and integer-based indexing, but this duality could lead to ambiguous cases, especially when dealing with mixed-type indices. This ambiguity could potentially lead to errors that are hard to track.\n\nHere's why you should use `.loc[]` and `.iloc[]`:\n\n1. **Clarity and Explicitness**: Using `.loc[]` and `.iloc[]` makes your code more explicit and readable. It becomes immediately clear to anyone reading your code whether the indexing is based on labels or integers.\n\n2. **Avoiding Ambiguity**: By separating label-based and integer-based indexing, you avoid the ambiguity that could result from using `.ix[]`.\n\n3. **Consistency with Future Versions**: Since `.ix[]` is no longer available, sticking to `.loc[]` and `.iloc[]` ensures that your code is compatible with current and future versions of pandas.\n\n4. **Advanced Features**: `.loc[]` and `.iloc[]` offer more advanced features for selecting subsets of your data. For example, `.loc[]` can be used with boolean arrays for complex conditional selections.\n\nIn summary, while `.ix[]` might have seemed more convenient at first glance, using `.loc[]` and `.iloc[]` is a best practice in pandas due to their clarity, explicitness, and support for advanced indexing features."
