When I use the `tuple()` function directly on the string or convert the string to a list before using the `tuple()` function, the string splits into individual characters. Here are a few examples of what I've tried and what I'm expecting:\n\nFailed attempts:\n```python\na = 'Quattro TT'\nprint(tuple(a))\n\na = 'Quattro TT'\nprint(tuple(list(a)))\n```\nBoth of these attempts resulted in output of `('Q', 'u', 'a', 't', 't', 'r', 'o', ' ', 'T', 'T')`, which split the string into individual characters in a tuple.\n\nSuccessful attempt with a list:\n```python\na = ['Quattro TT']\nprint(tuple(a))\n```\nThis produced the expected output of `('Quattro TT')`, but my input is a string, not a list.\n\nHow can I achieve this same output when starting with a string instead of a list?"

        "content": "To convert a string into a tuple without splitting its characters, you can wrap the string in a list before converting it to a tuple. This ensures that the entire string is treated as a single element in the tuple. Here's how you can achieve this in a one-liner:\n\n```python\na = 'Quattro TT'\nresult = (a,)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code snippet will produce the desired output:\n\n```\n('Quattro TT',)\n```\n\nBy wrapping the string `a` with an additional comma (`,`), you are creating a tuple with the entire string as a single element. This approach does not require converting the string to a list first and directly constructs the tuple from the string, maintaining the string as a whole."
