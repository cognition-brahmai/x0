        "content": "To configure pylint to only display warnings and errors, and ignore convention and refactor messages, you can adjust the configuration either from the command line or by modifying the `pylintrc` file.\n\n### Command Line\n\nYou can use the `--disable` option to ignore specific message categories when running pylint from the command line. To ignore convention (`C`) and refactor (`R`) messages, you can use:\n\n```bash\npylint --disable=C,R your_script.py\n```\n\nThis command tells pylint to disable all convention and refactor messages while analyzing `your_script.py`.\n\n### pylintrc File\n\nTo make this configuration persistent across all pylint runs for a project, you can modify the `pylintrc` file. If you don't already have a `pylintrc` file, you can generate one using:\n\n```bash\npylint --generate-rcfile > .pylintrc\n```\n\nOpen the generated `.pylintrc` file in a text editor and look for the section labeled `[MESSAGES CONTROL]`. You can disable convention and refactor messages by adding or modifying the `disable` line as follows:\n\n```ini\n[MESSAGES CONTROL]\ndisable=C,R\n```\n\nThis will ensure that pylint ignores convention and refactor messages in all future runs for the project where the `.pylintrc` file is located.\n\nBy using either of these methods, you can configure pylint to focus only on warnings and errors in your code."
