        "content": "The error you're encountering is because the `set_session` method has been deprecated in the latest versions of Keras and TensorFlow. In recent versions, Keras is integrated with TensorFlow, and you don't need to manually set the session anymore. Instead, TensorFlow manages the session automatically.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to work with the current versions of TensorFlow and Keras:\n\n1. Ensure that you have TensorFlow 2.x installed. You can check your TensorFlow version with:\n\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n   print(tf.__version__)\n   ```\n\n2. If you are using TensorFlow 2.x, you should use the eager execution mode, which is enabled by default. This means you don't have to deal with sessions explicitly.\n\n3. If you still need to manage sessions manually for some reason, you can use the following approach with TensorFlow's `tf.compat.v1` module:\n\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n   from keras import backend as K\n\n   # Disable eager execution\n   tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()\n\n   # Create a session\n   sess = tf.compat.v1.Session()\n\n   # Set the session for Keras\n   K.set_session(sess)\n   ```\n\nKeep in mind that managing sessions manually is generally not recommended in TensorFlow 2.x unless you have a specific need to do so, as the library is designed to be used with eager execution or the `tf.function` decorator for graph execution.\n\nIf you're starting a new project, it's best to embrace the new workflow and avoid using sessions directly unless absolutely necessary."
