I am specifically seeking solutions that allow me to write and publish code to servers that will automatically scale up to meet demand. I do not want to spend my time on IT tasks. The only option I've found so far is PiCloud (https://www.picloud.com/). While Google App Engine is great, it has some limitations such as lack of https support."

        "content": "There are several alternatives to Google App Engine for Python cloud hosting that provide automatic scaling and minimize the need for IT management tasks. Here are some options you might consider:\n\n1. **Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Beanstalk**: AWS Elastic Beanstalk supports Python applications and automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, and scaling to application health monitoring.\n\n2. **Microsoft Azure App Service**: Azure offers a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps. It supports multiple languages, including Python, and provides automatic scaling, load balancing, and security features.\n\n3. **Heroku**: Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build and run applications entirely in the cloud. It supports Python and offers features like automatic scaling, easy deployments, and a wide range of add-ons.\n\n4. **IBM Cloud Foundry**: IBM Cloud Foundry is an open-source platform that allows you to deploy and run Python applications quickly. It provides auto-scaling, integrated DevOps, and a variety of service integrations.\n\n5. **DigitalOcean App Platform**: DigitalOcean's App Platform is a PaaS that helps you build, deploy, and scale Python applications quickly. It offers automatic scaling, HTTPS, and other managed services.\n\n6. **Google Cloud Run**: While part of Google Cloud, Cloud Run is distinct from App Engine. It allows you to run stateless containers that can automatically scale based on demand and supports any language, including Python.\n\n7. **Vercel**: Originally focused on front-end applications, Vercel now supports serverless functions and can be used to deploy Python applications. It offers automatic scaling and global distribution.\n\n8. **Netlify**: Similar to Vercel, Netlify is primarily used for front-end applications but supports serverless functions, including those written in Python, with automatic scaling and easy deployment.\n\nWhen choosing a cloud hosting provider, consider factors such as pricing, ease of use, integration with other services, and the specific needs of your application."
