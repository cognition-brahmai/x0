The error message indicates a failure with the 'x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc' command and mentions an issue with 'ffi.h'. What could be the reason for this installation failure? Is there any additional software necessary to install cryptography on an Ubuntu system?\n\nError Message:\n```\nInstalling egg-scripts.\nuses namespace packages but the distribution does not require setuptools.\nGetting distribution for 'cryptography==0.2.1'.\n\nno previously-included directories found matching 'documentation/_build'\nzip_safe flag not set; analyzing archive contents...\nsix: module references __path__\n\nInstalled /tmp/easy_install-oUz7ei/cryptography-0.2.1/.eggs/six-1.10.0-py2.7.egg\nSearching for cffi>=0.8\nReading https://pypi.python.org/simple/cffi/\nBest match: cffi 1.5.0\nDownloading https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/c/cffi/cffi-1.5.0.tar.gz#md5=dec8441e67880494ee881305059af656\nProcessing cffi-1.5.0.tar.gz\nWriting /tmp/easy_install-oUz7ei/cryptography-0.2.1/temp/easy_install-Yf2Yl3/cffi-1.5.0/setup.cfg\nRunning cffi-1.5.0/setup.py -q bdist_egg --dist-dir /tmp/easy_install-oUz7ei/cryptography-0.2.1/temp/easy_install-Yf2Yl3/cffi-1.5.0/egg-dist-tmp-A2kjMD\nc/_cffi_backend.c:15:17: fatal error: ffi.h: No such file or directory\n#include <ffi.h>\n                 ^\ncompilation terminated.\nerror: Setup script exited with error: command 'x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc' failed with exit status 1\nAn error occurred when trying to install cryptography 0.2.1.

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to a missing library that the `cryptography` package depends on. Specifically, the error message indicates that the `ffi.h` header file is not found. This header file is part of the `libffi` library, which is a dependency for the `cffi` package used by `cryptography`.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to install the development packages for `libffi` and `python-dev` (or `python3-dev` if you're using Python 3) on your system. Here's how you can do that:\n\n1. **Update your package list:**\n\n   Open a terminal and run the following command to ensure your package list is up to date:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   ```\n\n2. **Install the required packages:**\n\n   Run the following command to install `libffi-dev` and `python-dev` (or `python3-dev` for Python 3):\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install libffi-dev python-dev\n   ```\n\n   If you're using Python 3, replace `python-dev` with `python3-dev`:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install libffi-dev python3-dev\n   ```\n\n3. **Install the `cryptography` package:**\n\n   Once the dependencies are installed, you can try installing the `cryptography` package again using `pip`. If you don't have `pip` installed, you can install it first:\n\n   For Python 2:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install python-pip\n   ```\n\n   For Python 3:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install python3-pip\n   ```\n\n   Now, install the `cryptography` package:\n\n   For Python 2:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install cryptography\n   ```\n\n   For Python 3:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip3 install cryptography\n   ```\n\nThese steps should resolve the issue and allow you to successfully install the `cryptography` package on your Ubuntu 14.04 LTS system. If you encounter any further issues, ensure that all necessary build tools, such as `build-essential`, are also installed:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n```"
