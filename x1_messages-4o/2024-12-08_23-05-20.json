The data collected is as follows:\nMaterial Temperature (\u00b0C) Change in Length (mm)\n--------------------------------------------------------\nAluminum -10 -0.05\nSteel -10 -0.02\nAluminum -20 -0.10\nSteel -20 -0.04\nUsing this data, can you explain why the two materials behave differently and how their behavior can be predicted in cold temperatures? Please provide your answer in a Latex formula."

        "content": "The difference in behavior between aluminum and steel when exposed to cold temperatures can be explained by their distinct coefficients of thermal expansion. The coefficient of thermal expansion indicates how much a material will expand or contract with a change in temperature. \n\nFor a linear object, the change in length \\(\\Delta L\\) due to a temperature change \\(\\Delta T\\) can be described by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta L = \\alpha \\cdot L_0 \\cdot \\Delta T\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\Delta L\\) is the change in length,\n- \\(\\alpha\\) is the coefficient of thermal expansion,\n- \\(L_0\\) is the original length,\n- \\(\\Delta T\\) is the change in temperature.\n\nGiven the data:\n- Aluminum: \\(\\Delta L = -0.05 \\, \\text{mm}\\) at \\(\\Delta T = -10 \\, \\text{\u00b0C}\\)\n- Steel: \\(\\Delta L = -0.02 \\, \\text{mm}\\) at \\(\\Delta T = -10 \\, \\text{\u00b0C}\\)\n\nAssuming the original lengths (\\(L_0\\)) are equal for both materials, we can express the ratio of the coefficients of thermal expansion:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\alpha_{\\text{Al}}}{\\alpha_{\\text{Steel}}} = \\frac{\\Delta L_{\\text{Aluminum}}}{\\Delta L_{\\text{Steel}}}\n\\]\n\nUsing the data at \\(-10 \\, \\text{\u00b0C}\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{\\alpha_{\\text{Al}}}{\\alpha_{\\text{Steel}}} = \\frac{-0.05}{-0.02} = 2.5\n\\]\n\nThis ratio indicates that aluminum has a higher coefficient of thermal expansion than steel, which means it will expand or contract more than steel for the same temperature change.\n\nIn general, to predict the behavior of these materials in cold temperatures, you can use the formula provided for each material with their respective coefficients of thermal expansion. The greater the value of \\(\\alpha\\), the more significant the change in length for a given temperature change."
