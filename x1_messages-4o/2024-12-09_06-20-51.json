However, I want to make sure that the rescaling only happens when a new image is loaded or the existing image is updated, not when the description is updated. How can I check for this? Here is the model I'm working with:\n\n```python\nclass Model(model.Model):\n    image=models.ImageField(upload_to='folder')\n    thumb=models.ImageField(upload_to='folder')\n    description=models.CharField()\n\n    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        if self.image:\n            small=rescale_image(self.image,width=100,height=100)\n            self.image_small=SimpleUploadedFile(name,small_pic)\n        super(Model, self).save(*args, **kwargs)\n```\nI want to rescale only if a new image is loaded or the image is updated, but not when the description is updated."

        "content": "To achieve the behavior where the image is only rescaled when a new image is uploaded or the existing image is updated, you can compare the current image with the image stored in the database before saving the model. Here\u2019s how you can modify your `save` method to implement this check:\n\n```python\nfrom django.core.files.uploadedfile import SimpleUploadedFile\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass Model(models.Model):\n    image = models.ImageField(upload_to='folder')\n    thumb = models.ImageField(upload_to='folder', blank=True, null=True)\n    description = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n\n    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Check if the instance already exists in the database\n        if self.pk:\n            # Fetch the existing object from the database\n            existing = Model.objects.get(pk=self.pk)\n            # Check if the image has changed\n            if existing.image != self.image:\n                # Rescale the image if it has changed\n                small = rescale_image(self.image, width=100, height=100)\n                self.thumb = SimpleUploadedFile(self.image.name, small)\n        else:\n            # If the instance is new, rescale the image\n            small = rescale_image(self.image, width=100, height=100)\n            self.thumb = SimpleUploadedFile(self.image.name, small)\n\n        # Call the original save method\n        super(Model, self).save(*args, **kwargs)\n\ndef rescale_image(image, width, height):\n    # Implement your image rescaling logic here\n    # This function should return the rescaled image data\n    pass\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Check for Existing Instance**: We check if the instance already exists by checking `self.pk`. If it does, we fetch the existing instance from the database.\n2. **Compare Images**: We compare the current image (`self.image`) with the existing image (`existing.image`). If they are different, it means the image has been updated, and we proceed to rescale.\n3. **Rescale on New Instance**: If `self.pk` is `None`, it means this is a new instance, and we should rescale the image.\n\n### Notes:\n- Ensure that your `rescale_image` function correctly handles image processing and returns the image data.\n- The `thumb` field is used to store the rescaled image. Ensure that it is optional by setting `blank=True` and `null=True`.\n- Adjust the `description` field's `max_length` as needed.\n\nThis approach ensures that the image is only rescaled when necessary, avoiding unnecessary processing when only the description is updated."
