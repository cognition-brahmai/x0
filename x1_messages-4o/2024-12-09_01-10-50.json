On the first computer, in the urls.py file, I have a line like `(r'^cast/$', 'mySite.simulate.views.cast')`. This URL will work for both `mySite.com/cast/` and `mySite.com/cast`. \n\nHowever, on the second computer, I have a similar URL written out like `(r'^login/$', 'mySite.myUser.views.login')`. For some reason, the URL `mySite.com/login/` will work on this computer, but `mySite.com/login` hangs and doesn't redirect back to `mySite.com/login/` like it does on the first computer. I can't figure out the issue as both urls.py files seem identical to me."

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is likely related to Django's `APPEND_SLASH` setting and possibly the middleware configuration in your Django project. Here's what you should check and try:\n\n1. **APPEND_SLASH Setting**: \n   - Django has a setting called `APPEND_SLASH` which, when set to `True`, automatically appends a slash to URLs that don't end with one and tries again. This is the default behavior.\n   - Ensure that the `APPEND_SLASH` setting in your `settings.py` file is set to `True` on both computers. \n\n   ```python\n   APPEND_SLASH = True\n   ```\n\n2. **Middleware Configuration**:\n   - The Django middleware responsible for handling URL slashes is the `CommonMiddleware`. Ensure that it is included in the `MIDDLEWARE` list in your `settings.py` file.\n   \n   ```python\n   MIDDLEWARE = [\n       # ... other middleware ...\n       'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',\n       # ... other middleware ...\n   ]\n   ```\n\n3. **Server Configuration**:\n   - If you're using a specific web server (like Apache or Nginx), ensure that the configurations between the two computers are consistent. Sometimes, URL handling might be affected by server settings.\n\n4. **Check for Differences in Django Version**:\n   - Versions of Django may handle certain settings differently. Make sure that both computers are running the same version of Django.\n\n5. **Check for Differences in Installed Applications**:\n   - If you have custom middleware or any installed applications that might affect URL routing, ensure that they are identical on both systems.\n\n6. **Debugging**:\n   - You can add some logging or print statements in your views or middleware to see how requests are being handled and where they might be differing between the two systems.\n\nBy ensuring these configurations are consistent across both computers, you should be able to achieve the same URL behavior on both systems. If the issue persists even after verifying these settings, you may want to compare other parts of the project setup, like virtual environments or any custom code that might affect URL processing."
