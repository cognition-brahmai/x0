        "content": "Your R code is mostly correct, but let's go through it step by step to ensure it works effectively and is clear:\n\n1. Convert the text to lowercase to treat words like \"The\" and \"the\" as the same.\n2. Split the text into words using a regular expression that matches non-word characters (`\\\\W+`).\n3. Count the frequency of each word using the `table()` function.\n4. Sort the frequency table in ascending order.\n5. Extract the word with the lowest frequency and its count.\n\nHere's the complete R code:\n\n```r\n# Define the text\ntext <- \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\n\n# Convert the text to lowercase and split into words\nwords <- strsplit(tolower(text), \"\\\\W+\")[[1]]\n\n# Create a frequency table of the words\nword_table <- table(words)\n\n# Sort the table to find the least frequent word\nsorted_table <- sort(word_table, decreasing = FALSE)\n\n# Identify the least frequent word and its count\nleast_freq_word <- names(sorted_table)[1]\nleast_freq_count <- sorted_table[1]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(paste(\"The least frequent word is\", least_freq_word, \"with a count of\", least_freq_count))\n```\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- If there are multiple words with the same least frequency, this code will only return the first one found alphabetically due to the sorting method.\n- If the input text is very large, consider additional text preprocessing steps, such as removing common stopwords if they are not of interest.\n- If you want to handle ties (multiple least frequent words), you might modify the code to identify all words with the minimum frequency. Here's how you could do it:\n\n```r\n# Find all words with the minimum frequency\nleast_freq_words <- names(sorted_table[sorted_table == least_freq_count])\n\n# Print all least frequent words and their count\nprint(paste(\"The least frequent words are\", paste(least_freq_words, collapse = \", \"), \"with a count of\", least_freq_count))\n```\n\nThis will ensure you capture all words that have the same minimum frequency in the text."
