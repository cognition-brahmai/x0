        "content": "How can I restore weights with different names but the same shapes in Tensorflow? I have multiple architectures and would like to train one of the networks and use the trained weights of the similar layers in another network. I am able to save and reload the weights in an architecture with an exactly similar naming convention for the variables. However, when the weights have different names in the two networks, restoration is not possible. For instance, I have the naming convention 'selector_network/c2w/var1' for the first network and 'joint_network/c2w/var1' for the second network. The variables are similar in terms of shape. Is there a way to change the names upon reloading or to instruct Tensorflow where to fit those variables? Also, I attempted using a script from @batzner that allows renaming the variables of a Tensorflow checkpoint, but it resulted in a ValueError: Couldn't find 'checkpoint' file or checkpoints in given directory ./joint_pos_tagger_lemmatizer/fi/."

        "content": "To achieve what you're trying to do, you'll need to manually map the variables from one network to the other. Since TensorFlow doesn't automatically match variables with different names, you have to handle this renaming process yourself. Here's a step-by-step guide to assist you:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide:\n\n1. **Load the Original Checkpoint:**\n   First, you'll load the checkpoint from the trained model using `tf.train.Checkpoint`.\n\n2. **Extract and Rename Variables:**\n   Extract the variables from this checkpoint and rename them to match the new network's variable names. You can use a dictionary to map old variable names to new ones.\n\n3. **Create a New Checkpoint:**\n   Save the renamed variables into a new checkpoint that can be loaded by your other network.\n\n### Example Code:\n\nHere's a code snippet that demonstrates how you might go about doing this:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Define the mapping from old variable names to new variable names\nvariable_mapping = {\n    'selector_network/c2w/var1': 'joint_network/c2w/var1',\n    # Add more mappings as needed\n}\n\n# Load the original checkpoint\noriginal_checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint()\noriginal_checkpoint.restore('./path_to_original_checkpoint')\n\n# Create a dictionary to hold the renamed variables\nrenamed_vars = {}\n\n# Rename the variables based on the mapping\nfor old_name, new_name in variable_mapping.items():\n    old_var = original_checkpoint.get_variable_by_name(old_name)\n    renamed_vars[new_name] = old_var\n\n# Create a new checkpoint with the renamed variables\nnew_checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(**renamed_vars)\n\n# Save the new checkpoint\nnew_checkpoint.save('./path_to_new_checkpoint')\n\n# Load the new checkpoint into your new model\nnew_model = YourNewModel()  # Replace with your model definition\nnew_checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=new_model)\nnew_checkpoint.restore('./path_to_new_checkpoint').expect_partial()\n\n# Verify the weights have been restored correctly\nnew_model.summary()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Variable Mapping:** Make sure your `variable_mapping` dictionary correctly maps every variable from the original network to the new network.\n  \n- **Variable Retrieval:** Use `get_variable_by_name` or similar methods to retrieve variables by their names from the checkpoint.\n\n- **Save and Load:** After mapping and renaming, save the new checkpoint and load it into your new model.\n\n### Troubleshooting ValueError:\n\nIf you encounter a `ValueError` regarding the checkpoint file, ensure that:\n\n1. **Correct Path:** The path to the checkpoint is correct, and the files exist at that location.\n   \n2. **Checkpoint Files:** All necessary checkpoint files (e.g., `.index` and `.data-00000-of-00001`) are present.\n\n3. **TensorFlow Version Compatibility:** Ensure that the TensorFlow version you're using is compatible with the checkpoint format.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively transfer weights between networks despite differences in variable names."
