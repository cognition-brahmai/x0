However, I am facing an issue with the line of code `torch.Tensor(5, 3)`. It's throwing an error `AttributeError: module 'torch' has no attribute 'Tensor'`. The same command is working in Torch. Can you help me understand and solve this problem?\n\nHere is the error in detail:\n```python\n>>> torch.Tensor(5, 3)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nAttributeError: module 'torch' has no attribute 'Tensor'\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that the `torch` module is not properly installed or imported in your current Python environment. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify Installation**: First, ensure that PyTorch is installed in your environment. You can check this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip show torch\n   ```\n\n   If PyTorch is not installed, you can install it using:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install torch\n   ```\n\n   Make sure you have the correct version for your Python and CUDA (if you're using GPU) setup. You can get the installation command from the [official PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).\n\n2. **Check Import Statement**: Ensure that you are correctly importing the PyTorch library in your script. The import statement should be:\n\n   ```python\n   import torch\n   ```\n\n3. **Version Compatibility**: Since you're using Python 3.5.1, it's possible that there could be compatibility issues with newer versions of PyTorch. Consider upgrading your Python version to 3.6 or higher, as newer PyTorch releases might not support Python 3.5.x.\n\n4. **Module Name Conflicts**: Make sure there are no files named `torch.py` in your current directory or in your Python path, as this can cause conflicts with the PyTorch module.\n\n5. **Check PyTorch Version**: If PyTorch is installed, verify its version to ensure compatibility. You can check this by running:\n\n   ```python\n   import torch\n   print(torch.__version__)\n   ```\n\n6. **Reinstall PyTorch**: If none of the above steps work, try reinstalling PyTorch:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall torch\n   pip install torch\n   ```\n\nAfter following these steps, try running your code again to see if the issue is resolved. If the problem persists, consider creating a new virtual environment and installing PyTorch there, as this can help isolate any environment-specific issues."
