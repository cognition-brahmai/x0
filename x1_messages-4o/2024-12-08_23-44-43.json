John works part-time at a coffee shop from Monday to Friday, earning different hourly rates depending on the day and time he works. Using the given table, you need to extract relevant information to determine the average hourly rate John earned on Wednesdays between the hours of 2pm and 6pm. This task will require specific knowledge of SQL syntax and multiple-step reasoning to arrive at the solution. Good luck!"

        "content": "To solve this logic puzzle using SQL, we need to assume that there is a database table that records John's work hours, the day of the week, the time periods, and his hourly rates. Since you haven't provided the exact structure of the table, let's assume it looks something like this:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE WorkHours (\n    id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    day_of_week VARCHAR(10),\n    start_time TIME,\n    end_time TIME,\n    hourly_rate DECIMAL(5, 2)\n);\n```\n\nGiven this assumed structure, we want to determine the average hourly rate John earned on Wednesdays between 2 PM and 6 PM. Here is how you could write the SQL query to find this information:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(hourly_rate) AS average_hourly_rate\nFROM WorkHours\nWHERE day_of_week = 'Wednesday'\n  AND start_time >= '14:00:00'\n  AND end_time <= '18:00:00';\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **SELECT AVG(hourly_rate) AS average_hourly_rate**: This part calculates the average of the `hourly_rate` column for the rows that match the conditions specified in the `WHERE` clause. \n\n2. **FROM WorkHours**: Specifies the table from which to retrieve the data.\n\n3. **WHERE day_of_week = 'Wednesday'**: Filters the rows to only include entries where the `day_of_week` is 'Wednesday'.\n\n4. **AND start_time >= '14:00:00' AND end_time <= '18:00:00'**: Adds additional filters to select only those rows where the work hours fall between 2 PM and 6 PM.\n\nThis query will give you the average hourly rate that John earned during the specified time on Wednesdays. Note that this assumes that the time periods are recorded in 24-hour format and that work hours don't span across multiple days or time periods that exceed the specified range. Adjustments might be needed depending on the actual structure of your database and data."
