        "content": "I am currently working on a forecasting problem with multivariate data (over 100 variables) where I need to predict one of these variables. The time series frequency is every 1 minute and I'm looking to do multi-step forecasting from t1 to t30. I have been able to achieve this with a univariate approach using only the target variable and the datetime variable, with FB Prophet's Python API. However, is it possible to use the same API to conduct a multivariate multi-step forecast? I appreciate any guidance or advice on this issue."

        "content": "FB Prophet is primarily designed for univariate time series forecasting, focusing on modeling a single time series variable over time. It doesn't inherently support multivariate forecasting, where multiple input variables are considered to predict a target variable. However, there are ways to incorporate additional information into your forecasts, albeit indirectly.\n\nHere are some strategies you might consider:\n\n1. **Feature Engineering**: \n   - Create additional features from your multivariate dataset and include them as regressors in Prophet. For example, you can add external regressors that Prophet can take into account during modeling. These can be derived features or key variables you believe impact the target variable.\n   \n   ```python\n   from fbprophet import Prophet\n   import pandas as pd\n\n   # Assume df is your dataframe with 'ds' as datetime and 'y' as the target variable\n   # Additional regressors\n   df['regressor1'] = ...\n   df['regressor2'] = ...\n\n   m = Prophet()\n   m.add_regressor('regressor1')\n   m.add_regressor('regressor2')\n   m.fit(df)\n\n   # Create future dataframe and include regressors\n   future = m.make_future_dataframe(periods=30, freq='min')\n   future['regressor1'] = ...\n   future['regressor2'] = ...\n\n   forecast = m.predict(future)\n   ```\n\n2. **Hybrid Models**:\n   - Combine Prophet with other machine learning models. Use Prophet for capturing seasonality and trend, and then use the residuals or the outputs from Prophet as features in another model that handles multivariate data, like Random Forest, XGBoost, or neural networks.\n\n3. **Advanced Time Series Models**:\n   - Consider using models specifically designed for multivariate forecasting. Models like Vector Autoregression (VAR), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, or Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT) are more suited for handling multiple time series data.\n\n4. **Data Reduction Techniques**:\n   - If including all 100 variables is computationally expensive or leads to overfitting, consider dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the feature space while retaining most of the information.\n\n5. **Time Series Libraries**:\n   - Explore libraries like GluonTS, Darts, or PyCaret's time series module, which have capabilities to handle multivariate time series forecasting.\n\nEach of these methods has its trade-offs, and the choice depends on the specifics of your data, the complexity you are willing to handle, and the performance requirements of your forecasting task. Experiment with a few approaches to determine what works best for your particular application."
