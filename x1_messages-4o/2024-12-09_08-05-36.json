        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the use of the logical `and` operator with NumPy arrays. In NumPy, when you want to perform element-wise logical operations, you should use bitwise operators instead of the Python logical operators `and`, `or`, and `not`. \n\nFor your specific case, you should use the bitwise `&` operator for element-wise logical \"and\" operations. Each condition should be enclosed in parentheses to ensure the correct operator precedence. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Example NumPy array\nx = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])\n\n# Perform element-wise logical operation\nresult = (x > 1) & (x < 3)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will give you a boolean array where each element satisfies the condition `1 < x < 3`. The `&` operator performs the element-wise \"and\" operation, and the parentheses ensure that the comparison operators are evaluated before the \"and\" operation. \n\nSimilarly, if you were using \"or\" logic, you would use the `|` operator for element-wise logical \"or\"."
