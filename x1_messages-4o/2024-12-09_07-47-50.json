I initially installed xcode command line tools, homebrew, and python as per instructions, later I needed to downgrade Python version from 3.9 to 3.7.9. When I tried to install Python 3.7.9 using pyenv, I encountered an error, 'C compiler cannot create executables'. It appears that my gcc version might be out of date, but I am not sure how to update it. Also, it seems like pyenv is using clang and not gcc, could this be a problem? How can I resolve this issue?\n\nHere are the commands I ran:\n```\nxcode-select --install\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)\"\nbrew install python\nbrew install pyenv\npyenv install 3.7.9\n```\nHere is the error message I received:\n```\n/var/folders/8n/ml0qwc091w9bhpszzxy9djl00000gn/T/python-build.20210118111111.56108 /usr/local/Cellar\n/var/folders/8n/ml0qwc091w9bhpszzxy9djl00000gn/T/python-build.20210118111111.56108/Python-3.7.9 /var/folders/8n/ml0qwc091w9bhpszzxy9djl00000gn/T/python-build.20210118111111.56108 /usr/local/Cellar\nchecking build system type... x86_64-apple-darwin20.2.0\nchecking host system type... x86_64-apple-darwin20.2.0\nchecking for python3.7... no\nchecking for python3... python3\nchecking for --enable-universalsdk... no\nchecking for --with-universal-archs... no\nchecking MACHDEP... checking for --without-gcc... no\nchecking for --with-icc... no\nchecking for gcc... clang\nchecking whether the C compiler works... no\nconfigure: error: in `/var/folders/8n/ml0qwc091w9bhpszzxy9djl00000gn/T/python-build.20210118111111.56108/Python-3.7.9':\nconfigure: error: C compiler cannot create executables\nSee `config.log' for more details\nmake: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.

        "content": "The error message you're encountering, \"C compiler cannot create executables,\" typically indicates a problem with your compiler configuration. Here are some steps you can follow to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Xcode Command Line Tools are Installed Properly:**\n   You already ran `xcode-select --install`, but it's good to double-check if it's installed correctly. Run the following command to ensure Xcode Command Line Tools are set up:\n\n   ```sh\n   xcode-select -p\n   ```\n\n   If it returns a valid directory path, the tools are installed. Otherwise, try reinstalling them:\n\n   ```sh\n   sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools\n   xcode-select --install\n   ```\n\n2. **Update Homebrew and Packages:**\n   Ensure Homebrew and all installed packages are up-to-date:\n\n   ```sh\n   brew update\n   brew upgrade\n   ```\n\n3. **Install GCC:**\n   Although `clang` is typically used on macOS, you can try installing a newer version of `gcc` using Homebrew:\n\n   ```sh\n   brew install gcc\n   ```\n\n   After installing, check the version of `gcc`:\n\n   ```sh\n   gcc --version\n   ```\n\n   This should show a newer version than 4.2.1.\n\n4. **Set Environment Variables:**\n   You may need to override the default compiler settings to use the new `gcc` if required. Add these lines to your shell profile (`~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):\n\n   ```sh\n   export CC=$(brew --prefix)/bin/gcc-$(gcc -dumpversion | cut -c 1-2)\n   export CXX=$(brew --prefix)/bin/g++-$(gcc -dumpversion | cut -c 1-2)\n   ```\n\n   Then, restart your terminal or source the profile:\n\n   ```sh\n   source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bash_profile\n   ```\n\n5. **Reinstall Python using Pyenv:**\n   With the updated configurations, try reinstalling the desired Python version using pyenv:\n\n   ```sh\n   pyenv install 3.7.9\n   ```\n\n6. **Check the Config Log:**\n   If the error persists, examine the `config.log` file mentioned in the error message. This file may provide more information about why the C compiler is failing.\n\n7. **Switch to Clang if Needed:**\n   If using `gcc` doesn't work, try explicitly setting `clang` as the compiler:\n\n   ```sh\n   export CC=clang\n   export CXX=clang++\n   ```\n\n   Then, retry the pyenv installation.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to address the issue and successfully install Python 3.7.9 using pyenv on macOS Big Sur."
