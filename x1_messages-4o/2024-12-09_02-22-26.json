I am currently using the Python requests module for sending a RESTful GET to a server and I receive the response in JSON format. The JSON response mainly consists of a list of lists. How can I convert this response into a native Python object so I can either iterate over it or print it out using pprint?"

        "content": "To efficiently parse a JSON response from the `requests` library in Python, you can use the `json()` method provided by the `requests` library, which directly converts the JSON response into a native Python object (such as a dictionary or a list, depending on the structure of your JSON). Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n1. **Send the GET request**: Use the `requests.get()` method to send your GET request to the server.\n\n2. **Parse the JSON response**: Use the `json()` method on the response object to parse the JSON data.\n\n3. **Iterate or Process**: Once you have the JSON data as a Python object, you can iterate over it or process it as needed.\n\n4. **Pretty Print (Optional)**: Use the `pprint` module to print the JSON data in a more readable format.\n\nHere's a sample code demonstrating these steps:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom pprint import pprint\n\n# Step 1: Send the GET request\nurl = 'https://api.example.com/data'  # Replace with your actual API endpoint\nresponse = requests.get(url)\n\n# Step 2: Parse the JSON response\ntry:\n    json_data = response.json()  # This converts JSON into a native Python object\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(\"Error parsing JSON:\", e)\n    json_data = None\n\n# Step 3: Iterate or process the JSON data\nif json_data:\n    # Assuming json_data is a list of lists\n    for item in json_data:\n        # Process each item as needed\n        print(item)\n\n# Step 4: Pretty Print the JSON data\npprint(json_data)\n```\n\n### Notes:\n- **Error Handling**: It's important to handle potential errors when calling `response.json()`, as it will raise a `ValueError` if the response body does not contain valid JSON.\n- **Response Status Check**: Before parsing the JSON, you might also want to check the HTTP status code to ensure that the request was successful (e.g., using `response.status_code`).\n- **pprint Module**: The `pprint` module is useful for printing data structures in a more readable way, especially when dealing with nested lists or dictionaries."
