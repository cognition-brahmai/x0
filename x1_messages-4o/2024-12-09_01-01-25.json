I have searched in `_math.c` and `mathmodule.c` but haven't been able to locate it. I am aware that Python utilizes C's math functions. Are these included in the Python distribution or are they linked to code located elsewhere? I am using Mac OS X."

        "content": "In Python, the `math.sqrt()` function is essentially a wrapper around the C library function `sqrt()`. The implementation of these functions is typically not in the Python source code itself but in the standard C library that Python links against. This is why you won't find the actual algorithm for `math.sqrt()` in Python's source files like `_math.c` or `mathmodule.c`.\n\nOn Mac OS X and other systems, the C standard library is provided by the system's runtime, such as `libm` on Unix-like systems, which includes the `sqrt()` function. Python simply calls these existing functions provided by the system's C library.\n\nIf you want to see how `sqrt()` is implemented at a lower level, you would need to look at the source code of the C library used by your operating system, such as the GNU C Library (glibc) for Linux systems or Apple's equivalent for macOS. However, these libraries can be quite complex and optimized, often using hardware-specific instructions for efficiency.\n\nFor practical purposes, if you're interested in understanding how square root calculations can be implemented algorithmically, you can look into algorithms like the Newton's (or Heron's) method for computing square roots, which is a common approach taught in numerical methods courses."
