I have been following a two-part tutorial (Part 1 and Part 2) and have managed to construct tf-idf matrices for my document set. However, the tutorial does not cover how to use cosine similarity to find the distance between two documents. I know how to implement cosine similarity with respect to two vectors of similar length, but I am not sure how to apply this in my case. Here is the code I have so far, and the resulting matrix:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfTransformer\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nimport numpy as np\nimport numpy.linalg as LA\n\ntrain_set = [\"The sky is blue.\", \"The sun is bright.\"]  # Documents\ntest_set = [\"The sun in the sky is bright.\"]  # Query\nstopWords = stopwords.words('english')\n\nvectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words = stopWords)\ntransformer = TfidfTransformer()\n\ntrainVectorizerArray = vectorizer.fit_transform(train_set).toarray()\ntestVectorizerArray = vectorizer.transform(test_set).toarray()\nprint 'Fit Vectorizer to train set', trainVectorizerArray\nprint 'Transform Vectorizer to test set', testVectorizerArray\n\ntransformer.fit(trainVectorizerArray)\nprint\nprint transformer.transform(trainVectorizerArray).toarray()\n\ntransformer.fit(testVectorizerArray)\nprint \ntfidf = transformer.transform(testVectorizerArray)\nprint tfidf.todense()\n```\n\nAnd the output:\n\n```\nFit Vectorizer to train set [[1 0 1 0]\n [0 1 0 1]]\nTransform Vectorizer to test set [[0 1 1 1]]\n\n[[ 0.70710678  0.          0.70710678  0.        ]\n [ 0.          0.70710678  0.          0.70710678]]\n\n[[ 0.          0.57735027  0.57735027  0.57735027]]\n```\n\nHow can I use this output to calculate cosine similarity?"

        "content": "To calculate cosine similarity using the TF-IDF matrices you've generated, you can use the formula for cosine similarity:\n\n\\[ \\text{cosine\\_similarity}(A, B) = \\frac{A \\cdot B}{\\|A\\| \\|B\\|} \\]\n\nHere, \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are the TF-IDF vectors of the documents you want to compare. The dot product \\( A \\cdot B \\) calculates the sum of the element-wise products of the vectors, and \\( \\|A\\| \\) and \\( \\|B\\| \\) are the Euclidean norms (magnitudes) of the vectors.\n\nLet's apply this to your TF-IDF vectors. You've already printed the TF-IDF vectors:\n\n- For the train set:\n  - Document 1: `[0.70710678, 0., 0.70710678, 0.]`\n  - Document 2: `[0., 0.70710678, 0., 0.70710678]`\n\n- For the test set:\n  - Query: `[0., 0.57735027, 0.57735027, 0.57735027]`\n\nYou can compute the cosine similarity between the query vector and each of the train set vectors using the formula. Here's how you can do it in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom numpy import dot\nfrom numpy.linalg import norm\n\n# Define the vectors\ntrain_tfidf = np.array([\n    [0.70710678, 0., 0.70710678, 0.],\n    [0., 0.70710678, 0., 0.70710678]\n])\n\ntest_tfidf = np.array([0., 0.57735027, 0.57735027, 0.57735027])\n\n# Calculate cosine similarity\ncosine_similarities = []\nfor train_vector in train_tfidf:\n    cosine_sim = dot(test_tfidf, train_vector) / (norm(test_tfidf) * norm(train_vector))\n    cosine_similarities.append(cosine_sim)\n\nprint(\"Cosine Similarities:\", cosine_similarities)\n```\n\nThis will give you an array of cosine similarities between the test set query and each document in the train set. The closer the cosine similarity is to 1, the more similar the documents are. \n\nIn this example, you should get the cosine similarities for the query document with each of the two documents in your train set."
