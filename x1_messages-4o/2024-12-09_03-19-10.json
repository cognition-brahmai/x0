I found some other libraries like oauth-python-twitter2, python-twitter, python-twyt, twitty-twister, twython, and Tweepy. My requirements are to use OAuth, follow a user, send a direct message, post, and if possible, use the Streaming API. I am not using twisted in this case. Can anyone recommend any of these libraries, or perhaps others based on their experiences?"
