        "content": "To find the number of ways to represent an integer `n` as the sum of two or more consecutive integers, you can use a mathematical approach based on the properties of arithmetic sequences. Here's a Python function that implements this:\n\n```python\ndef count_consecutive_sum_ways(n):\n    count = 0\n    k = 2  # Start with 2 consecutive numbers\n\n    while k * (k + 1) // 2 <= n:\n        # Check if (n - sum_of_first_k_numbers) is divisible by k\n        if (n - k * (k + 1) // 2) % k == 0:\n            count += 1\n        \n        k += 1\n\n    return count\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 15\nways = count_consecutive_sum_ways(n)\nprint(f\"The number of ways to represent {n} as the sum of two or more consecutive integers is: {ways}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Concept**: We are looking for sequences of consecutive integers that sum up to `n`. If you start with an integer `a` and have `k` consecutive integers, the sum of these integers is given by:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum} = a + (a+1) + (a+2) + \\ldots + (a+k-1) = \\frac{k(2a + k - 1)}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   For this sum to equal `n`, you have:\n   \n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{k(2a + k - 1)}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Rearranging gives:\n\n   \\[\n   2n = k(2a + k - 1)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Iteration**: The loop iterates over possible lengths `k` of consecutive sequences. The minimum `k` is 2 since we need at least two numbers.\n\n3. **Condition**: For each `k`, check if `(n - k * (k + 1) / 2)` is divisible by `k`. This ensures that there exists an integer starting point `a`.\n\n4. **Counting**: Increment the count of valid representations each time the condition is satisfied.\n\nThis code provides a straightforward way to calculate the number of ways to represent `n` as the sum of two or more consecutive integers."
