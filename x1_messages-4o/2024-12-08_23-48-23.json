To calculate C, the color scheme match score, we can use the formula: C = (N - D) / N, where N is the total number of colors used in the brand's visual identity and D is the number of distinct colors used in the website design. Similarly, to calculate T, the typography match score, we can use the formula: T = (N - D) / N, where N is the total number of font styles used in the brand's visual identity and D is the number of distinct font styles used in the website design. For F, the overall feel match score, we can use a subjective assessment and rate it on a scale of 1-10, which can then be converted to a percentage. Finally, we can average these three scores to get the BIS, which provides a quantifiable measure of how well the website design integrates with the brand."
