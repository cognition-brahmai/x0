        "content": "In Python, functions are first-class objects, and each function object has a unique identity. When you compare function objects using comparison operators like `==`, `>`, or `<`, Python is essentially comparing their identities, which are their memory addresses, unless the functions have been explicitly defined with custom comparison behavior.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening in your code:\n\n1. **`fun1 == fun1`**: This returns `True` because both operands are the same function object, thus having the same identity.\n\n2. **`fun1 == fun2`**: This returns `False` because `fun1` and `fun2` are two different lambda expressions, each creating a new function object. Even though they have the same body, they are different objects in memory.\n\n3. **`fun1 > fun2` and `fun1 < fun2`**: These comparisons are based on the memory address of the function objects. Python uses the `id()` function to obtain the memory address of an object. The comparison is effectively comparing `id(fun1)` with `id(fun2)`. Since these addresses are arbitrary and depend on where the objects are stored in memory, the result can seem random.\n\n4. **`fun1 > 1`**: This comparison also uses the memory address of `fun1`. When comparing a function object to an integer like `1`, Python will use the `id()` of the function and compare it to the integer directly, which usually results in `True` because memory addresses of objects are typically larger than small integers.\n\nIn Python, function objects do not have explicit `__lt__`, `__eq__`, etc., methods for comparison. Instead, these behaviors are handled internally by Python's object model, which defaults to comparing object identities when no specific comparison methods are defined.\n\nWhen it comes to low-level implementation, the CPython interpreter (the standard implementation of Python) handles object comparisons using C-level pointer comparisons when Python-level comparisons are not explicitly defined. This is why you don't see explicit comparison methods but still get comparison behavior based on identity."
