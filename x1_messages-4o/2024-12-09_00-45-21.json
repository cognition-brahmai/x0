However, when I print the value retrieved from Redis, I see a 'b' character prefixing my string \"Hello Python\". Can someone explain why this is happening and how can I remove it? Here is my code:\n\n```python\nimport redis\nredisClient = redis.StrictRedis(host='192.168.3.88',port=6379)\nredisClient.set('test_redis', 'Hello Python')\nvalue = redisClient.get('test_redis')\nprint(value)  # outputs: b'Hello Python'\n```"

        "content": "The 'b' character you see is indicating that the data retrieved from Redis is in bytes format. In Python 3, strings are represented as Unicode, and bytes are represented with a 'b' prefix to distinguish them from regular strings. Redis stores data as bytes, so when you retrieve a value, it\u2019s returned as a bytes object.\n\nTo convert the bytes object to a string, you can use the `decode()` method. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport redis\n\nredisClient = redis.StrictRedis(host='192.168.3.88', port=6379)\nredisClient.set('test_redis', 'Hello Python')\nvalue = redisClient.get('test_redis')\n\n# Decode the bytes object to a string\ndecoded_value = value.decode('utf-8')\nprint(decoded_value)  # outputs: Hello Python\n```\n\nIn this code, `decode('utf-8')` converts the bytes object to a string using UTF-8 encoding, which is a common encoding format for text data. This will remove the 'b' prefix and print the string as expected."
