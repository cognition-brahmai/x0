Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport shutil\n\nsource_file = \"./blah.txt\"\ndestination_path = \"./a/b/c/blah.txt\"\n\n# Extract the directory path from the destination path\ndestination_dir = os.path.dirname(destination_path)\n\n# Create the directory if it doesn't exist\nos.makedirs(destination_dir, exist_ok=True)\n\n# Copy the file\nshutil.copy(source_file, destination_path)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1. `os.path.dirname(destination_path)` extracts the directory part from the destination path.\n2. `os.makedirs(destination_dir, exist_ok=True)` creates the directory and any necessary parent directories. The `exist_ok=True` parameter ensures that no error is raised if the directory already exists.\n3. `shutil.copy(source_file, destination_path)` performs the file copy operation.\n\nThis approach ensures that the destination directory structure is created before attempting to copy the file, thus avoiding any errors related to non-existent directories."
