        "content": "To configure PyCharm 2.7.2 to check for PEP8 code style violations, especially when working on a Django app, you need to ensure that a few additional settings are correctly configured beyond just enabling the PEP8 inspections. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure the Interpreter is Set Correctly**:\n   - Go to `File` > `Settings` (or `PyCharm` > `Preferences` on macOS).\n   - Navigate to `Project: <Your Project Name>` > `Python Interpreter`.\n   - Make sure the Python interpreter you are using is correctly set to the one where your Django app is running.\n\n2. **Install PEP8 Tools**:\n   - Ensure that you have the `pep8` (now `pycodestyle`) package installed in your Python environment. You can do this via the terminal:\n     ```bash\n     pip install pycodestyle\n     ```\n   - You might also consider installing `flake8`, which is a wrapper around `pycodestyle` and other tools:\n     ```bash\n     pip install flake8\n     ```\n\n3. **Configure PyCharm to Use External Tools** (Optional but recommended):\n   - Go to `File` > `Settings`.\n   - Navigate to `Tools` > `External Tools`.\n   - Add a new tool by clicking on the `+` button.\n   - Set the name to `PEP8` or `PyCodeStyle`.\n   - Set the program to the path of the `pycodestyle` or `flake8` executable (you can find this by running `which pycodestyle` or `which flake8` in your terminal).\n   - Set the parameters to `$FilePath$`.\n   - Set the working directory to `$ProjectFileDir$`.\n\n4. **Check Inspection Settings**:\n   - Go to `File` > `Settings`.\n   - Navigate to `Editor` > `Inspections`.\n   - Under the `Python` section, make sure `PEP8 coding style violation` is checked.\n   - Also, check the `Code Style` settings under `Editor` to ensure PEP8 is selected.\n\n5. **Reindexing**:\n   - Sometimes, PyCharm might need to reindex the project.\n   - Go to `File` > `Invalidate Caches / Restart` and choose `Invalidate and Restart`.\n\n6. **Run Code Inspections Manually**:\n   - You can run code inspections manually by navigating to `Code` > `Inspect Code` and selecting the scope you want to inspect.\n\n7. **Check for Any Plugin Conflicts**:\n   - Ensure there are no other plugins installed that might be overriding the inspection settings.\n\n8. **Update PyCharm**:\n   - If possible, consider updating your PyCharm to a more recent version as 2.7.2 is quite outdated, and newer versions have improved support and features for code style checking.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to configure PyCharm to highlight PEP8 code style violations effectively. If the issue persists, checking the PyCharm logs or contacting JetBrains support might provide additional insights."
