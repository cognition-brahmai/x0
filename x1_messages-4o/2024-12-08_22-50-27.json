        "content": "Creating a Ruby program to generate a unique haiku about a sunset involves constructing a structure that respects the 5-7-5 syllable pattern and selecting words randomly to create a meaningful poem. Here\u2019s a simplified approach:\n\n1. **Define Word Pools with Syllables**: Create arrays of words categorized by their syllable count.\n\n2. **Build the Haiku**: Randomly select words from these arrays to construct lines that adhere to the 5-7-5 syllable structure.\n\n3. **Combine and Display**: Combine the words into lines and display them as a haiku.\n\nHere is an example of how you might implement this in Ruby:\n\n```ruby\n# Define word pools categorized by syllables\none_syllable_words = [\"sun\", \"sky\", \"red\", \"gold\", \"hue\", \"glow\", \"sea\"]\ntwo_syllable_words = [\"sunset\", \"twilight\", \"crimson\", \"ocean\", \"evening\"]\nthree_syllable_words = [\"horizon\", \"colorful\", \"beautiful\", \"whispering\"]\nfour_syllable_words = [\"illuminate\", \"magnificent\"]\nfive_syllable_words = [\"over the mountains\", \"painting the skyline\"]\n\n# Function to randomly select words to form a line with a desired syllable count\ndef construct_line(syllables, word_pools)\n  line = []\n  while syllables > 0\n    possible_words = word_pools.select { |k, _| k <= syllables }\n    syllable_count, words = possible_words.sample\n    word = words.sample\n    line << word\n    syllables -= syllable_count\n  end\n  line.join(\" \")\nend\n\n# Build the haiku\ndef generate_haiku\n  # Define available word pools\n  word_pools = {\n    1 => one_syllable_words,\n    2 => two_syllable_words,\n    3 => three_syllable_words,\n    4 => four_syllable_words,\n    5 => five_syllable_words\n  }\n\n  # Construct each line of the haiku\n  line1 = construct_line(5, word_pools)\n  line2 = construct_line(7, word_pools)\n  line3 = construct_line(5, word_pools)\n\n  # Combine lines into a haiku\n  \"#{line1}\\n#{line2}\\n#{line3}\"\nend\n\n# Generate and display a haiku\nputs generate_haiku\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Word Pools**: Words are organized by their syllable count. You can expand these lists with more words that fit each category.\n- **Constructing Lines**: The function `construct_line` selects words from the appropriate pools to form a line that matches the required syllable count.\n- **Generate Haiku**: The `generate_haiku` method uses `construct_line` to create each line of the haiku, ensuring the 5-7-5 structure.\n\nThis is a basic example, and you can enhance it by adding more words, refining the selection process to ensure better poetic coherence, and expanding the logic to incorporate more sophisticated language patterns or themes."
