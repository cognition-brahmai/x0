I initially implemented my algorithm using global memory, then switched to texture memory but found that it made my application slower. I then converted the code to use cudaArray/tex2D, but there was no change in performance. I'm using GeForce GT 620M (Fermi, compute cap. 2.1), and came across Shane Cook's \"CUDA Programming\" where he suggests that use of texture memory for cache properties has become largely obsolete with the introduction of Fermi and its larger L1 and L2 caches. Should I continue trying to optimize performance using texture memory and its cache, or would it be better to stick with global memory and L1/L2 cache?"

        "content": "Given your situation and the hardware you are using, it's crucial to focus on optimizing memory access patterns to leverage the capabilities of your specific GPU architecture effectively. Here are some considerations and steps you can take to optimize performance:\n\n1. **Global Memory Coalescing:** Ensure that your global memory accesses are coalesced. This means that threads in a warp should access consecutive memory addresses to achieve maximum bandwidth. This is often the most significant optimization in CUDA programming.\n\n2. **Shared Memory:** Use shared memory to reduce global memory access. Load data into shared memory, perform computations, and then write back to global memory. This can significantly reduce memory latency if used correctly.\n\n3. **L1 and L2 Cache:** Given the Fermi architecture's enhanced L1 and L2 cache, optimizing for these caches can be beneficial. Ensure that your data access patterns take advantage of spatial and temporal locality to maximize cache hits.\n\n4. **Texture Memory:** While texture memory's cache benefits are reduced in newer architectures, it can still be useful for specific access patterns, such as 2D spatial locality. If your access patterns naturally fit this model, it might still be worth exploring, but if not, focusing on global memory optimizations might be more productive.\n\n5. **Profile and Optimize:** Use CUDA profiling tools like NVIDIA Nsight or nvprof to analyze your application's performance. Identify bottlenecks, memory access patterns, and cache utilization. This can guide you in deciding whether texture memory provides any benefits.\n\n6. **Algorithmic Optimization:** Sometimes, rethinking your algorithm to better fit the GPU's architecture can lead to significant performance gains. Consider alternative algorithms that might naturally align with the GPU's strengths.\n\n7. **Experimentation:** Ultimately, the best approach might require experimentation. Try variations of your implementation to see which combinations of memory usage and caching yield the best performance for your specific application.\n\nIn summary, given your hardware, focusing on global memory optimizations, coalesced accesses, and effective use of shared memory might provide better returns than relying on texture memory for cache benefits. However, profiling your application will give you the most accurate insight into where optimizations can be made."
