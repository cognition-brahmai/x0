However, my computer won't install it and I have not needed it before. Is there any way to resolve this without installing Visual Studio?"

        "content": "When you encounter the error \"Command errored out with exit status 1: python setup.py egg_info\" while trying to install `auto-py-to-exe` using pip, it usually indicates that a package dependency requires compilation and thus needs the Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools. While installing Visual Studio is one option, there are a few alternative solutions you can try:\n\n1. **Precompiled Binaries**: Check if there are precompiled binaries for the package you are trying to install. Websites like Christoph Gohlke's [Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) often provide these, which can be installed using pip.\n\n2. **Install a Wheel File**: If a wheel file (.whl) is available for the package and its dependencies, it can often bypass the need for compilation. You can download the appropriate wheel file for your Python version and system architecture and install it using pip:\n   ```\n   pip install package_name.whl\n   ```\n\n3. **Use a Different Python Distribution**: Some Python distributions come bundled with necessary compilers. Anaconda, for instance, comes with a wide array of precompiled packages. You might consider using Anaconda to manage your Python environment.\n\n4. **Check for Pure Python Alternatives**: Sometimes there are pure Python alternatives to the package you are trying to install. Check the package documentation or look for similar libraries that might not require compilation.\n\n5. **Check Dependency Requirements**: For `auto-py-to-exe`, ensure all its dependencies are installed. Sometimes, the error message might be misleading, and not all dependencies are correctly installed.\n\n6. **Docker or Virtual Machine**: As a last resort, you could set up a Docker container or a virtual machine that has the required build environment and Python setup to install the package.\n\nIf these options do not resolve the issue, you may need to consider installing the required Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools, as some packages are dependent on them for building extensions. You can often install these tools without the full Visual Studio IDE. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. Visit the [Microsoft Build Tools for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) page.\n2. Download the \"Build Tools for Visual Studio\" installer.\n3. During installation, select the \"C++ build tools\" workload.\n\nThis approach should allow you to compile Python packages that require C extensions."
