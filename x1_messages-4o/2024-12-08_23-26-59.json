The data is stored in a CSV file with the following columns: species name, weight, height, and diet type. Your goal is to find the average weight and height for each diet type. \nHere's the current Python code you are using:\n```\nimport csv\ndata = {}\nwith open('animal_data.csv') as file:\n    reader = csv.reader(file)\n    next(reader)\n    for row in reader:\n        if row[3] not in data:\n            data[row[3]] = [float(row[1]), float(row[2]), 1]\n        else:\n            data[row[3]][0] += float(row[1])\n            data[row[3]][1] += float(row[2])\n            data[row[3]][2] += 1\nfor key in data:\n    avg_weight = round(data[key][0]/data[key][2], 2)\n    avg_height = round(data[key][1]/data[key][2], 2)\n    print(\"Diet type:\", key)\n    print(\"Average weight:\", avg_weight)\n    print(\"Average height:\", avg_height)\n```\nHowever, this code is taking a long time to run on the large dataset. Can you optimize this code to make it run faster and more efficiently?"

        "content": "To optimize the code for better performance, you can make a few improvements. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Use `defaultdict` from the `collections` module**: This can simplify the code and potentially speed it up by avoiding repeated dictionary key checks.\n\n2. **Avoid repeated calculations**: Calculate averages directly within the loop to reduce the number of operations performed later.\n\n3. **Use `with open` for file handling**: This is already being done, but make sure the file is in the correct mode ('r' for reading).\n\n4. **Optimize the loop**: Reduce unnecessary operations within the loop.\n\nHere's an optimized version of the code:\n\n```python\nimport csv\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\n# Use defaultdict to handle missing keys automatically\ndata = defaultdict(lambda: [0, 0, 0])\n\nwith open('animal_data.csv', 'r') as file:\n    reader = csv.reader(file)\n    next(reader)  # Skip the header line\n    for row in reader:\n        diet_type = row[3]\n        weight = float(row[1])\n        height = float(row[2])\n\n        # Update totals and count for each diet type\n        data[diet_type][0] += weight\n        data[diet_type][1] += height\n        data[diet_type][2] += 1\n\n# Calculate and print averages\nfor diet_type, totals in data.items():\n    count = totals[2]\n    avg_weight = round(totals[0] / count, 2)\n    avg_height = round(totals[1] / count, 2)\n    print(f\"Diet type: {diet_type}\")\n    print(f\"Average weight: {avg_weight}\")\n    print(f\"Average height: {avg_height}\")\n```\n\n### Key Improvements:\n- **`defaultdict`** automatically initializes a list for each new key, avoiding explicit checks and initializations.\n- **Reducing operations in the loop**: By directly assigning and updating values in the dictionary, the inner loop is streamlined.\n- **Efficient string formatting**: Using f-strings for output is more efficient and readable.\n\nThese changes make the code more efficient and cleaner, which can help with processing larger datasets more quickly."
