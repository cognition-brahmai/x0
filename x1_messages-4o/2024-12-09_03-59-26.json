        "content": "I am trying to understand the use of yield in list comprehensions and generator expressions in Python 3.4. I have noticed some unusual behaviour. For instance, when I execute the following lines of code:\n```\n>>> [(yield i) for i in range(3)]\n<generator object <listcomp> at 0x0245C148>\n>>> list([(yield i) for i in range(3)])\n[0, 1, 2]\n>>> list((yield i) for i in range(3))\n[0, None, 1, None, 2, None]\n```\nThe last line sometimes doesn't always return `None`, instead it returns whatever we `send` into the generator. This seems to be equivalent to the following generator:\n```\ndef f():\n   for i in range(3):\n      yield (yield i)\n```\nBut according to Python's reference, `yield` is only allowed in a function definition. Furthermore, the first two lines produce a `SyntaxError` in Python 2.7, but the third line doesn't. I also find it strange that a list comprehension returns a generator and not a list, and that the generator expression converted to a list and the corresponding list comprehension contain different values. Can someone explain this to me?"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is indeed interesting and can be confusing at first. Let's break down what's happening with each piece of code you provided:\n\n1. **List Comprehension with `yield`**:\n   ```python\n   [(yield i) for i in range(3)]\n   ```\n   This line, even though it seems like a list comprehension, is actually not doing what you might initially expect. In Python 3.x, using `yield` within a list comprehension actually turns it into a generator expression. This is why you see a generator object as the result. It does not produce a `SyntaxError` because Python 3 allows `yield` expressions within comprehensions, but they behave differently than in Python 2.\n\n2. **Converting the Generator to a List**:\n   ```python\n   list([(yield i) for i in range(3)])\n   ```\n   In this case, you are explicitly converting the generator produced by the comprehension into a list. The `yield` expression is evaluated for each element in the range, yielding the numbers `0`, `1`, and `2`. The list comprehension gets these values and forms a list out of them.\n\n3. **Generator Expression with `yield`**:\n   ```python\n   list((yield i) for i in range(3))\n   ```\n   This line is a generator expression, and it behaves slightly differently. The generator expression `(yield i) for i in range(3)` generates values `0, None, 1, None, 2, None` when converted to a list. Here\u2019s why: for each `i`, the `yield i` yields the value `i`, and then the next call to `next()` on the generator waits for a value to be sent back, which defaults to `None` if nothing is sent. Hence, you get `i` followed by `None` for each iteration.\n\n   The behavior where `None` is returned unless a value is sent into the generator aligns with how generator functions work when using `yield`. Essentially, `yield` pauses the function and resumes it when `next()` or `send()` is called, providing the value from `send()` if used.\n\n4. **Python 2.7 vs Python 3.x Differences**:\n   The reason for the `SyntaxError` in Python 2.7 is that `yield` expressions are not allowed in comprehensions or generator expressions in Python 2. Python 3 introduced changes that allow `yield` in these contexts but with different semantics, as you've observed.\n\nOverall, the crucial point is understanding how `yield` works within comprehensions and generator expressions in Python 3. When you use `yield`, you're effectively creating a generator. This generator's behavior will depend on how you iterate over it and whether you send values into it or not."
