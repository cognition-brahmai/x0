How can I call the \"distToPoint\" function within the \"isNear\" function? Here is the code I'm working with:\n\n```python\nclass Coordinates:\n    def distToPoint(self, p):\n        \"\"\"\n        Use pythagoras to find distance\n        (a^2 = b^2 + c^2)\n        \"\"\"\n        ...\n\n    def isNear(self, p):\n        distToPoint(self, p)\n        ...\n```"

        "content": "To call the `distToPoint` function within the `isNear` function in the same class, you should use `self` to access the method. Here's how you can modify your `isNear` method to call `distToPoint`:\n\n```python\nclass Coordinates:\n    def distToPoint(self, p):\n        \"\"\"\n        Use Pythagoras to find distance\n        (a^2 = b^2 + c^2)\n        \"\"\"\n        # Example implementation, assuming p is a tuple (x, y)\n        x1, y1 = p\n        x2, y2 = 0, 0  # Assuming (0, 0) as the reference point for this example\n        return ((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2) ** 0.5\n\n    def isNear(self, p, threshold=5):\n        # Call distToPoint using self\n        distance = self.distToPoint(p)\n        # Check if the distance is within a certain threshold\n        return distance < threshold\n\n# Example usage:\ncoord = Coordinates()\npoint = (3, 4)\nprint(coord.isNear(point))  # Output will depend on the threshold value\n```\n\nIn this example, `self.distToPoint(p)` is used to call the `distToPoint` method from within the `isNear` method. You can then use the returned distance to perform any further checks, such as comparing it to a threshold to determine if the point is \"near\"."
