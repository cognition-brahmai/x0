This file typically contains a list of package names and versions that you want to install.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of what happens:\n\n- The `requirements.txt` file is a text file that lists the packages you want to install, one package per line. Each line might include just the package name or the package name and a specific version number or range.\n- By using the `-r` flag, pip reads the `requirements.txt` file and installs each package listed in it.\n  \nThis is a convenient way to manage dependencies for a project, ensuring that everyone working on the project is using the same package versions. Even though `-r` might not be listed directly under `pip help`, it's a standard part of the command for handling requirements files."
