I am aware of setting the HTTP_PROXY environment variable to the proxy address and it works fine with urllib, but I'm experiencing problems when using urllib2. When I run `urllib2.urlopen(\"http://www.google.com\").read()`, I receive the following errors: `urllib2.URLError: <urlopen error [Errno 10061] No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it>` and `urllib2.URLError: <urlopen error [Errno 11004] getaddrinfo failed>`. After trying a suggested solution, I got this error: `URLError: <urlopen error [Errno 10060] A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond>`. Can you suggest a solution to this problem?"

        "content": "When dealing with proxy issues in Python's `urllib2`, there are several steps you can take to resolve the problem. Let's walk through some potential solutions:\n\n1. **Ensure Proxy Settings Are Correct**: Double-check that the proxy address and port are correct. If you require authentication, ensure that the username and password are correct as well.\n\n2. **Set Proxy Directly in Code**: Instead of relying on environment variables, you can set the proxy directly in your code. Here's how you can do it with `urllib2`:\n\n   ```python\n   import urllib2\n\n   proxy = urllib2.ProxyHandler({'http': 'http://proxy_address:proxy_port'})\n   opener = urllib2.build_opener(proxy)\n   urllib2.install_opener(opener)\n\n   try:\n       response = urllib2.urlopen(\"http://www.google.com\")\n       html = response.read()\n       print(html)\n   except urllib2.URLError as e:\n       print(\"URLError: \", e.reason)\n   ```\n\n   Replace `'http://proxy_address:proxy_port'` with your actual proxy details.\n\n3. **Handle Authentication**: If your proxy requires authentication, you can use `ProxyBasicAuthHandler` or `ProxyDigestAuthHandler` as needed:\n\n   ```python\n   import urllib2\n\n   proxy = urllib2.ProxyHandler({'http': 'http://proxy_address:proxy_port'})\n   auth = urllib2.HTTPBasicAuthHandler()\n   auth.add_password(realm='Proxy Realm', uri='http://proxy_address', user='username', passwd='password')\n   opener = urllib2.build_opener(proxy, auth)\n   urllib2.install_opener(opener)\n\n   try:\n       response = urllib2.urlopen(\"http://www.google.com\")\n       html = response.read()\n       print(html)\n   except urllib2.URLError as e:\n       print(\"URLError: \", e.reason)\n   ```\n\n   Replace `'username'`, `'password'`, and other placeholders with actual values.\n\n4. **Check Network and Firewall Settings**: Ensure that your network or firewall settings are not blocking the connection. Sometimes corporate networks or firewalls may block certain traffic.\n\n5. **Use `requests` Library**: If `urllib2` continues to cause issues, consider using the `requests` library, which is more modern and user-friendly for handling HTTP requests and proxies:\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n\n   proxies = {\n       'http': 'http://proxy_address:proxy_port',\n       'https': 'http://proxy_address:proxy_port',\n   }\n\n   try:\n       response = requests.get(\"http://www.google.com\", proxies=proxies)\n       print(response.text)\n   except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n       print(\"RequestException: \", e)\n   ```\n\n6. **DNS Resolution**: The error `[Errno 11004] getaddrinfo failed` suggests a DNS resolution issue. Ensure that your DNS settings are correct and that your system can resolve domain names properly.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to troubleshoot and resolve the issue with `urllib2` and proxies. If the problem persists, consider checking for any updates or patches for the Python libraries or your network configuration."
