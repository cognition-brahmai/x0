Is there a way to assume that every incoming request's content-type is `application/json`? Essentially, I want to always have access to a valid `request.json` dictionary, even if the client forgets to set the application content-type to JSON."

        "content": "To handle this scenario, you can create a custom middleware or a helper function that ensures the incoming request data is parsed as JSON, even if the `Content-Type` header is not set to `application/json`. Here's one way to achieve this in your Flask application:\n\n1. **Create a helper function to parse JSON:**\n\n   You can define a function that attempts to parse the request data as JSON, regardless of the content type.\n\n   ```python\n   from flask import request, jsonify, Blueprint\n   import json\n\n   menus = Blueprint('menus', __name__)\n\n   def get_json_data():\n       if request.is_json:\n           return request.json\n       try:\n           return json.loads(request.data)\n       except json.JSONDecodeError:\n           return {}\n\n   @menus.route('/', methods=[\"PUT\", \"POST\"])\n   def new():\n       data = get_json_data()\n       return jsonify(data)\n   ```\n\n2. **Use the helper function in your route:**\n\n   By calling `get_json_data()`, you ensure that you always get a dictionary, even if the client didn't set the correct `Content-Type`. This function first checks if the request is already recognized as JSON by Flask (`request.is_json`). If not, it tries to parse the raw data using Python's `json.loads()`. If parsing fails, it returns an empty dictionary.\n\n3. **Considerations:**\n\n   - This approach assumes that requests without a `Content-Type` or with an incorrect `Content-Type` are intended to be JSON. This might not be suitable for all applications, so ensure it's a valid assumption for your use case.\n   - You might want to log or handle the scenario where JSON decoding fails to provide feedback to clients or monitor potential issues.\n   - If you expect other content types for some endpoints, consider implementing this logic conditionally or only for specific endpoints.\n\nBy using this approach, you can handle cases where the `Content-Type` is not set correctly while still ensuring that you consistently work with JSON data."
