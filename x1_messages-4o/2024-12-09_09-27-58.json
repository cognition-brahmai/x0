You can use the built-in `http` module to set up the server. Here's a step-by-step guide with a simple example:\n\n1. **Initialize a Node.js Project**:\n   First, make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, create a new directory for your project and initialize it with npm.\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir my-node-server\n   cd my-node-server\n   npm init -y\n   ```\n\n2. **Create the Server Script**:\n   Create a file named `server.js` and add the following code to it.\n\n   ```javascript\n   const http = require('http');\n\n   // Define the server\n   const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {\n     // Set the response header\n     res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');\n\n     // Handle GET requests\n     if (req.method === 'GET' && req.url === '/') {\n       res.writeHead(200);\n       res.end(JSON.stringify({ message: 'Hello from GET request!' }));\n     }\n     // Handle POST requests\n     else if (req.method === 'POST' && req.url === '/') {\n       let body = '';\n\n       // Collect the data\n       req.on('data', chunk => {\n         body += chunk.toString();\n       });\n\n       // Respond once all data is received\n       req.on('end', () => {\n         res.writeHead(200);\n         res.end(JSON.stringify({ message: 'Hello from POST request!', data: body }));\n       });\n     }\n     // Handle other routes\n     else {\n       res.writeHead(404);\n       res.end(JSON.stringify({ message: 'Not Found' }));\n     }\n   });\n\n   // Start the server\n   const PORT = 3000;\n   server.listen(PORT, () => {\n     console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);\n   });\n   ```\n\n3. **Run the Server**:\n   Start the server by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   node server.js\n   ```\n\n   You should see the message: `Server is running on http://localhost:3000`.\n\n4. **Testing the Server**:\n   - **GET Request**: You can test the GET request by opening a browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see a response with the message for a GET request.\n\n   - **POST Request**: To test a POST request, you can use a tool like Postman or curl. Here is a curl example:\n\n     ```bash\n     curl -X POST -d \"name=John\" http://localhost:3000\n     ```\n\n     This should return a response with the message for a POST request along with the data you sent.\n\nThat's it! You've created a basic Node.js server that handles both GET and POST requests. You can expand this server by adding more routes and handling more complex logic as needed."
