        "content": "To design an algorithm that computes the sum of two integers while ensuring the sum is a non-negative integer, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Algorithm Design**:\n   - Take two integers as input parameters.\n   - Compute their sum.\n   - If the sum is negative, return zero instead to ensure non-negativity.\n   - Handle any potential overflow or underflow errors.\n\n2. **Table of Possible Inputs and Outputs**:\n   For the purposes of this explanation, we'll consider a simplified range of integers. In a practical scenario, the integer range depends on the system (e.g., 32-bit or 64-bit).\n\n   | Input A | Input B | Output Sum |\n   |---------|---------|------------|\n   | 0       | 0       | 0          |\n   | 1       | 2       | 3          |\n   | -1      | 1       | 0          |\n   | -2      | 3       | 1          |\n   | INT_MAX| 1       | INT_MAX    |\n   | INT_MIN| -1      | 0          |\n\n   Here, `INT_MAX` and `INT_MIN` refer to the maximum and minimum values an integer can hold, respectively.\n\n3. **Code Implementation**:\n   Below is a Python code implementing the algorithm with exception handling for overflow and underflow. Python inherently handles large integers, but we'll simulate the conditions.\n\n```python\ndef safe_add(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the sum of two integers, ensuring the sum is non-negative.\n    Handles potential overflow or underflow errors.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    a (int): First integer\n    b (int): Second integer\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The non-negative sum of a and b\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Compute the sum\n        result = a + b\n        \n        # Check for overflow\n        if result < a or result < b:\n            raise OverflowError(\"Integer overflow occurred\")\n        \n        # Ensure non-negative sum\n        if result < 0:\n            return 0\n        \n        return result\n    \n    except OverflowError:\n        # In case of overflow, return the maximum possible integer\n        return max(0, a) + max(0, b)  # Ensure non-negative even in overflow case\n\n# Test the function with a variety of inputs\ntest_cases = [\n    (0, 0),\n    (1, 2),\n    (-1, 1),\n    (-2, 3),\n    (2**31 - 1, 1),  # Simulate INT_MAX for 32-bit\n    (-2**31, -1)    # Simulate INT_MIN for 32-bit\n]\n\nfor a, b in test_cases:\n    print(f\"safe_add({a}, {b}) = {safe_add(a, b)}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Code**:\n- The function `safe_add` takes two integers, `a` and `b`.\n- It computes their sum and checks for overflow by comparing the sum with the original numbers.\n- If the sum is negative, it returns zero to ensure non-negativity.\n- Exception handling is used to simulate and handle overflow errors, though Python naturally supports large integers beyond typical 32-bit or 64-bit constraints.\n  \n**Efficiency**:\n- The algorithm runs in constant time, O(1), since it performs a simple arithmetic operation and a few conditional checks.\n- It effectively handles edge cases like overflow, underflow, and ensures the output is non-negative."
