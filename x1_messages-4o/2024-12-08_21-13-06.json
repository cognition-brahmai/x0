        "content": "To achieve this task using the Wolfram Alpha API and Python, you'll need to perform several steps, including querying the API for relevant data, filtering the results, and sorting them. Below is a step-by-step guide along with a Python script to help you accomplish this:\n\n1. **Set Up Your Environment**:\n   - Ensure you have an API key for Wolfram Alpha.\n   - Install necessary Python packages if you haven't already: `wolframalpha` for accessing the API.\n\n2. **Query Wolfram Alpha**:\n   - Use the Wolfram Alpha API to search for chemical compounds with the specified criteria.\n\n3. **Parse and Process the Data**:\n   - Extract the chemical compounds that match the criteria.\n   - Retrieve the molecular formula and boiling point for each compound.\n\n4. **Sort the Compounds**:\n   - Sort the compounds based on their boiling points in descending order.\n\n5. **Display the Results**:\n   - Print or store the sorted list of compounds with their molecular formula and boiling point.\n\nHere's a sample Python script to guide you through the process:\n\n```python\nimport wolframalpha\n\n# Replace 'YOUR_APP_ID' with your actual Wolfram Alpha App ID\napp_id = 'YOUR_APP_ID'\nclient = wolframalpha.Client(app_id)\n\n# Query for chemical compounds\nquery = \"chemical compounds with at least 3 carbon atoms and 2 nitrogen atoms\"\nresult = client.query(query)\n\n# Initialize a list to store compound information\ncompounds = []\n\n# Process the query results\nfor pod in result.pods:\n    if pod.title == \"Chemical compound properties\":\n        for sub in pod.subpods:\n            # Extract compound data\n            lines = sub.plaintext.split('\\n')\n            for line in lines:\n                parts = line.split('|')\n                if len(parts) == 3:\n                    name = parts[0].strip()\n                    formula = parts[1].strip()\n                    boiling_point = parts[2].strip().split()  # assuming boiling point is part of the line\n                    try:\n                        # Convert boiling point to float if possible\n                        boiling_point_value = float(boiling_point[0])\n                        compounds.append((name, formula, boiling_point_value))\n                    except ValueError:\n                        continue\n\n# Sort the compounds by boiling point in descending order\nsorted_compounds = sorted(compounds, key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)\n\n# Display the results\nprint(\"Compounds with at least 3 carbon atoms and 2 nitrogen atoms, sorted by boiling point:\")\nfor compound in sorted_compounds:\n    print(f\"Name: {compound[0]}, Formula: {compound[1]}, Boiling Point: {compound[2]} \u00b0C\")\n\n```\n\n**Note**:\n- Make sure to replace `'YOUR_APP_ID'` with your actual Wolfram Alpha App ID.\n- The script assumes that the boiling point is included in the query result and is properly formatted. Depending on the API's response, you may need to adjust the parsing logic.\n- The script also assumes that boiling point data is provided in a consistent format.\n\nThis script should provide a good starting point, but depending on the API's response format, you may need to adjust the parsing logic to correctly extract the molecular formula and boiling point information."
