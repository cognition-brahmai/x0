Here\u2019s how we can create a sample title based on your data:\n\n- HR department: \"1 accident in HR due to slipping on wet floors in January 2021\"\n- IT department: \"1 accident in IT due to injury while using a saw in January 2021\"\n- Maintenance department: \"1 accident in Maintenance due to falling from a ladder in January 2021\"\n- Sales department: \"1 accident in Sales due to burns while cooking in January 2021\"\n\nEach row in your data set represents a single accident, so the number of accidents per department is one for each entry. If you have more data, you can group by department and cause to provide more comprehensive titles."
