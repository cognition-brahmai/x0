        "content": "I am trying to subclass a tuple in Python and I am encountering an issue when initializing with multiple arguments. When I use a single argument in the `__init__` method, the code works as expected. However, when I try to use two arguments, I get a TypeError stating that tuple() takes at most 1 argument. Why is this happening and how can I resolve this?\n\nHere is the working code with a single argument:\n\n```python\nclass Foo(tuple):\n    def __init__(self, b):\n        super(Foo, self).__init__(tuple(b))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    print Foo([3, 4])\n\n$ python play.py \n```\n\nThe output is:\n\n```python\nplay.py:4: DeprecationWarning: object.__init__() takes no parameters\n  super(Foo, self).__init__(tuple(b))\n(3, 4)\n```\n\nHere is the code that throws the TypeError:\n\n```python\nclass Foo(tuple):\n    def __init__(self, a, b):\n        super(Foo, self).__init__(tuple(b))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    print Foo(None, [3, 4])\n\n$ python play.py \n```\n\nAnd the resulting error:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"play.py\", line 7, in <module>\n    print Foo(None, [3, 4])\nTypeError: tuple() takes at most 1 argument (2 given)\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering arises because the `tuple` class in Python is immutable and its `__init__` method does not accept any arguments. When you subclass a tuple, you need to initialize it using the `__new__` method instead of `__init__`.\n\nThe reason `__init__` is causing a problem is that `tuple` does not support initialization through `__init__`. Instead, the creation of the tuple object is handled in `__new__`, which is why you get the `TypeError` when trying to pass multiple arguments.\n\nHere's how you can subclass a tuple properly by using the `__new__` method:\n\n```python\nclass Foo(tuple):\n    def __new__(cls, a, b):\n        # Initialize the tuple with 'b'\n        return super(Foo, cls).__new__(cls, b)\n\n    def __init__(self, a, b):\n        # Optional: perform additional initialization if needed\n        self.a = a\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    print(Foo(None, [3, 4]))  # Output: (3, 4)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- The `__new__` method is used to create and initialize the immutable tuple object. It takes the class (`cls`) as its first argument, along with any additional arguments you wish to use for initialization.\n- Inside `__new__`, we call `super(Foo, cls).__new__(cls, b)` to create the tuple from `b`.\n- The `__init__` method can be used to perform any additional setup or store extra attributes, but it does not modify the tuple itself.\n\nBy using `__new__`, you can successfully initialize your subclass of `tuple` with multiple arguments."
