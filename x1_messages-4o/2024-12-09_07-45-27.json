I've come across this block of code in Python quite often:\n\n```python\ntry:\n   try_this(whatever)\nexcept SomeException as exception:\n   #Handle exception\nelse:\n   return something\n```\n\nI'm curious to know why try-except-else exists in Python. To me, it seems like it's using exceptions to perform flow control, which I'm not a fan of. However, since it is included in the language, is there a specific reason for its existence? \n\nMy understanding is that exceptions are not errors, and that they should only be used for exceptional conditions (for example, when I try to write a file into disk and there is no more space, or maybe I do not have permission), not for flow control. Normally, I handle exceptions like this:\n\n```python\nsomething = some_default_value\ntry:\n    something = try_this(whatever)\nexcept SomeException as exception:\n    #Handle exception\nfinally:\n    return something\n```\n\nAlternatively, if I do not want to return anything if an exception happens, then I would use:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    something = try_this(whatever)\n    return something\nexcept SomeException as exception:\n    #Handle exception\n```"

        "content": "Using `try-except-else` in Python can indeed be considered good practice in certain situations. The `else` block in a `try-except-else` construct is specifically designed to handle code that should execute only if no exceptions were raised in the `try` block. This provides a clear separation between the code that might raise an exception and the code that should run if everything goes smoothly.\n\nHere's why using `try-except-else` can be beneficial:\n\n1. **Clarity and Readability**: The `else` block helps in making the code more readable by clearly delineating the part of the code that should only run if no exceptions occur. This makes it easier for someone reading the code to understand the intended flow.\n\n2. **Avoiding Unintended Handling**: If you have some code that should only run when the `try` block succeeds, placing it in the `else` block ensures it doesn't accidentally get executed if an exception is caught.\n\n3. **Separation of Concerns**: It allows you to separate the logic that deals with successful execution from the logic that handles errors, making the code easier to maintain.\n\nYour understanding that exceptions should be used for exceptional conditions is correct. They are not intended for regular flow control but for handling unexpected situations. The `else` block provides a structured mechanism to deal with the normal flow after handling potential exceptions.\n\nRegarding your examples, both are valid approaches:\n\n- The first example with `finally` ensures that some cleanup or final actions are always executed, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It's useful when you need to release resources like files or network connections.\n\n- The second example without `finally` or `else` is simpler and effective when you don't have additional actions to perform after the `try` block succeeds, beyond returning a value.\n\nUltimately, whether to use `try-except-else` depends on the specific context and your coding style preference. If using `else` enhances the readability and maintainability of your code, it's worth considering."
