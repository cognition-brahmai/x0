If 'Survived' column has the value 1 but 'Age' is blank, I will keep it as null. I attempted to use the '&&' operator but it did not work. Here is my code:\n\n```python\ntdata.withColumn(\"Age\",  when((tdata.Age == \"\" && tdata.Survived == \"0\"), mean_age_0).otherwise(tdata.Age)).show()\n```\n\nThis throws a SyntaxError:\n\n```python\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n  File \"<ipython-input-33-3e691784411c>\", line 1\n    tdata.withColumn(\"Age\",  when((tdata.Age == \"\" && tdata.Survived == \"0\"), mean_age_0).otherwise(tdata.Age)).show()\n                                                    ^\n```\n\nAny suggestions on how to handle this?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the use of the `&&` operator, which is not valid in Python. In Python, you should use the `&` operator for bitwise AND operations when working with PySpark DataFrame API. Additionally, you should ensure that your conditions are enclosed in parentheses to avoid any precedence issues. \n\nHere's how you can modify your code to correctly handle the logic and fix the syntax error:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import when, col\n\n# Assuming mean_age_0 is the value you want to fill in for blank 'Age' entries\n# where 'Survived' is 0\n\ntdata = tdata.withColumn(\n    \"Age\", \n    when((col(\"Age\") == \"\") & (col(\"Survived\") == \"0\"), mean_age_0).otherwise(col(\"Age\"))\n)\n\ntdata.show()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- Use `col(\"column_name\")` to refer to DataFrame columns, which is a safer and more readable practice.\n- Replace `&&` with `&` for the logical AND operation.\n- Ensure that the conditions are wrapped in parentheses to handle the operation precedence correctly.\n\nThis should fix the syntax error and achieve the intended logic for updating the 'Age' column based on the conditions you specified."
