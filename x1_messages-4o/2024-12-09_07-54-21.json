I have confirmed the correct path of files using `print(os.listdir('./Dataset/images/'))` and the path is correct. However, I keep getting the following RuntimeError: `RuntimeError: Found 0 files in subfolders of: ./Dataset/images/ Supported extensions are: .jpg,.jpeg,.png,.ppm,.bmp,.pgm,.tif`. I have even tried `./dataset/1/images` but the result was the same. The code I am using is as follows:\n\n```python\nimg_dir = './Dataset/images/'\nimg_data = torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder(os.path.join(img_dir), transforms.Compose([\n            transforms.Scale(256),\n            transforms.RandomResizedCrop(224),\n            transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),\n            transforms.ToTensor(),\n            ]))\nimg_batch = data.DataLoader(img_data, batch_size=batch_size,\n                               shuffle = True, drop_last=True)\n```\n\nCan someone suggest what could be the issue and how to resolve this?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing typically stems from the `ImageFolder` class in PyTorch, which expects the directory structure to have subfolders representing different classes of images. Here are a few steps and suggestions to troubleshoot and resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Directory Structure**: Ensure that your directory structure is correct. The `ImageFolder` expects each class of images to be in a separate subfolder inside the `img_dir`. For example:\n   ```\n   ./Dataset/images/\n       \u251c\u2500\u2500 class1/\n       \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 image1.jpg\n       \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 image2.png\n       \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 ...\n       \u251c\u2500\u2500 class2/\n       \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 image1.jpg\n       \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 image2.png\n       \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 ...\n   ```\n   If all your images are in a single folder without subfolders, `ImageFolder` won't be able to find any images because it's looking for subfolders.\n\n2. **Check File Extensions**: Make sure that the images have one of the supported extensions (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, etc.). If your images have different extensions, they won't be detected.\n\n3. **Permissions**: Ensure that you have read permissions for the images and the directories.\n\n4. **Case Sensitivity**: On some systems, file extensions are case-sensitive. Make sure your file extensions are in lowercase.\n\n5. **Transformation Issues**: The transformation `transforms.Scale` is deprecated and has been replaced by `transforms.Resize`. Consider updating your transformations:\n   ```python\n   transforms.Compose([\n       transforms.Resize(256),\n       transforms.RandomResizedCrop(224),\n       transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),\n       transforms.ToTensor(),\n   ])\n   ```\n\n6. **Debugging**: Add some debug prints to check the content of your directories and ensure that `os.listdir()` is listing the expected files. For example:\n   ```python\n   import os\n\n   img_dir = './Dataset/images/'\n   for root, dirs, files in os.walk(img_dir):\n       print(root, \"has\", len(files), \"files\")\n   ```\n\n7. **Path Issues**: Ensure that there are no spaces or hidden characters in your path that might be causing issues.\n\nBy addressing these points, you should be able to resolve the issue and get your `ImageFolder` dataset to load correctly. If the problem persists, consider checking the PyTorch documentation and forums for any updates or similar issues."
