Can you suggest a new metaphor to use instead? \nHere is the original poem for reference:\nThis is the night that binds my heart\nLike a love sinking with the sun\nAnd here is the Ruby code that can be used to generate a new metaphor:\nmetaphor_options = [\"a bird soaring through the sky\", \"a ship navigating stormy seas\", \"a flower blooming in the spring\"]\nnew_metaphor = metaphor_options.sample\nputs \"This is the night that binds my heart, like #{new_metaphor}.

Here's how you can do it:\n\n```ruby\nmetaphor_options = [\"a bird soaring through the sky\", \"a ship navigating stormy seas\", \"a flower blooming in the spring\"]\nnew_metaphor = metaphor_options.sample\n\n# Original poem\noriginal_poem = \"This is the night that binds my heart\\nLike a love sinking with the sun\"\n\n# Rewrite the poem with the new metaphor\nrewritten_poem = original_poem.gsub(\"a love sinking with the sun\", new_metaphor)\n\nputs \"Rewritten Poem:\\n#{rewritten_poem}\"\n```\n\nThis code snippet selects a random metaphor from the `metaphor_options` array and replaces the original metaphor \"a love sinking with the sun\" in the poem with the newly selected metaphor. The `gsub` method is used to perform the replacement. When you run this code, it will output the poem with the new metaphor."
