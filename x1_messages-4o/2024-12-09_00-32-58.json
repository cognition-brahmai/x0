        "content": "Certainly! Embedding images in Sphinx documentation is straightforward. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Prepare Your Image:**\n   Ensure your image file (e.g., `example.png`) is in a directory that is accessible by your Sphinx documentation. A common practice is to place images in a directory called `_static` within your Sphinx project directory.\n\n2. **Modify `conf.py`:**\n   If you haven't already, make sure the `_static` directory is included in your `conf.py` file. This file is usually located in the root of your Sphinx documentation:\n\n   ```python\n   # Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets) here,\n   # relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files,\n   # so a file named \"default.css\" will overwrite the builtin \"default.css\".\n   html_static_path = ['_static']\n   ```\n\n3. **Embed the Image in Your `.rst` File:**\n   Insert the following reStructuredText code in your `.rst` file where you want the image to appear:\n\n   ```rst\n   .. image:: /_static/example.png\n      :alt: Example Image\n      :width: 400px\n      :align: center\n   ```\n\n   - `:alt:` provides alternative text for the image, which is useful for accessibility.\n   - `:width:` specifies the width of the image. You can adjust this to fit your needs.\n   - `:align:` can be set to `left`, `center`, or `right` to control the alignment of the image.\n\n4. **Build Your Documentation:**\n   After adding the image, rebuild your Sphinx documentation. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal from the root of your Sphinx project:\n\n   ```bash\n   make html\n   ```\n\n   This will regenerate the HTML files, and your image should now be embedded in the documentation.\n\n5. **Check Your Output:**\n   Open the generated HTML files (usually found in the `_build/html` directory) in a web browser to ensure that the image appears as expected.\n\nThat's it! You should now see your image embedded in your Sphinx documentation. If you encounter any issues, double-check the file paths and ensure that the image file is correctly placed in the `_static` directory."
