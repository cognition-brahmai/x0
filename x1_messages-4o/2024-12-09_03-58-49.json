For instance, when using the `loads` function from the `json` module, I want to return a custom string message when an exception occurs due to the input being `None`. Here is an example of what I'm trying to do:\n\n```python\nfrom json import loads\n\nresult = loads('{\"value\": true}') or \"Oh no, explosions occurred!\"\n# {'value': True}\n\nresult = loads(None) or \"Oh no, explosions occurred!\"\n# \"Oh no, explosions occurred!\" is desired, but a TypeError is raised.\n```\n\nIn the second case, I expect the result to be \"Oh no, explosions occurred!\" but instead, a TypeError is raised. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "In Python, you can handle exceptions in a one-liner by using a try-except block within a lambda function or a conditional expression. However, the traditional try-except block cannot be directly used as a one-liner outside of a function. Instead, you can leverage a lambda function to encapsulate the logic. Here's how you can achieve the desired behavior:\n\n```python\nfrom json import loads\n\n# Using a lambda function to handle exceptions\nsafe_loads = lambda s: loads(s) if s is not None else \"Oh no, explosions occurred!\"\n\ntry:\n    result = safe_loads('{\"value\": true}')  # This will be successful\nexcept Exception:\n    result = \"Oh no, explosions occurred!\"\nprint(result)  # Output: {'value': True}\n\ntry:\n    result = safe_loads(None)  # This will raise an exception\nexcept Exception:\n    result = \"Oh no, explosions occurred!\"\nprint(result)  # Output: \"Oh no, explosions occurred!\"\n```\n\nIn this example, `safe_loads` is a lambda function that attempts to call `loads` if the input is not `None`, otherwise it returns the custom error message. However, if you need to handle exceptions specifically inside the `loads` call, you would need to encapsulate that in a function, as shown above.\n\nFor a true one-liner expression:\n\n```python\nresult = (lambda s: loads(s) if s is not None else \"Oh no, explosions occurred!\")('{\"value\": true}')\nprint(result)  # Output: {'value': True}\n\nresult = (lambda s: \"Oh no, explosions occurred!\" if s is None else (lambda: loads(s))())(None)\nprint(result)  # Output: \"Oh no, explosions occurred!\"\n```\n\nIn the second lambda, we first check if `s` is `None`, and if so, we return the error message. Otherwise, we attempt to load the JSON string."
