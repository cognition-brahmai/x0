        "content": "The issue you're encountering with the `InvalidBasesError` when trying to create a proxy model for the `Group` model from `django.contrib.auth` typically arises due to the timing of migrations. The error message indicates that Django is unable to resolve the bases for your `GroupProxy` model, likely because it's trying to create the proxy before the base `Group` model is fully available or migrated.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step guide to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Correct Import**: Double-check that you are importing the `Group` model correctly from `django.contrib.auth.models`. It should look like this:\n\n    ```python\n    from django.contrib.auth.models import Group\n    ```\n\n2. **Check Migration Dependencies**: Ensure that your app's migration that includes the `GroupProxy` model has a dependency on the migration that creates the `Group` model in the `auth` app. This ensures that Django knows the `Group` model should be available before trying to create the proxy. You can specify this dependency in your migration file like this:\n\n    ```python\n    dependencies = [\n        ('auth', '0012_auto_something'),  # Use the actual migration name\n        # Other dependencies, if any\n    ]\n    ```\n\n   You can find the right migration name by looking in the `auth` app's migration files.\n\n3. **Run Migrations in Order**: Make sure you run the migrations in the correct order. Sometimes running `python manage.py migrate` in one go might not resolve dependencies correctly. Try running it step-by-step for `auth` first and then your app:\n\n    ```bash\n    python manage.py migrate auth\n    python manage.py migrate your_app_name\n    ```\n\n4. **Check for Circular Dependencies**: Ensure there are no circular dependencies among your migrations. This can cause Django to get confused about the order in which migrations should be applied.\n\n5. **Proxy Model Location**: Ensure the proxy model is defined in a models file within the app where you want the proxy to appear. The admin registration should also be in that app\u2019s `admin.py`.\n\n6. **Remove Unnecessary Migrations**: If you have previously attempted to create this proxy and it resulted in a migration, you might need to delete that migration and recreate it to ensure it is correctly formed.\n\n7. **Clear Old Migrations**: If you\u2019ve been experimenting with migrations and have a lot of unnecessary ones, it might help to clear them out by deleting the migration files and resetting the migrations. Be careful with this approach as it will affect your database schema.\n\nIf you follow these steps, you should be able to resolve the `InvalidBasesError` and successfully use the `GroupProxy` model in your Django application."
