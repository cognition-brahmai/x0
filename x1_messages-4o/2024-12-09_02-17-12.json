While trying to edit the `urls.py` file, I keep encountering an error message stating `cannot import name 'login' from 'django.contrib.auth.views'`. How can I resolve this issue? Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib.auth.views import login\nfrom django.urls import path\nfrom . import views\napp_name = \"users\"\nurlpatterns = [\n    path(\"login/\", \n         login, \n         {\"template_name\": \"users/login.html\"}, \n         name=\"login\"),\n]\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that in recent versions of Django (from Django 2.1 onwards), the `login` view has been replaced with `LoginView` class-based view. The function-based `login` view is no longer available. To resolve the error, you should update your `urls.py` to use the `LoginView` class.\n\nHere's how you can update your code:\n\n1. Import `LoginView` from `django.contrib.auth.views`.\n2. Use `LoginView.as_view()` in the `urlpatterns` to specify the login view.\n\nHere's the updated code:\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib.auth.views import LoginView\nfrom django.urls import path\nfrom . import views\n\napp_name = \"users\"\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    path(\"login/\", \n         LoginView.as_view(template_name=\"users/login.html\"), \n         name=\"login\"),\n]\n```\n\nThis change should resolve the import error and correctly set up the login functionality for your webpage using Django's class-based views. Make sure that your `users/login.html` template is set up correctly to handle the login form."
