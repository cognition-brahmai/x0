        "content": "To solve the problem of finding the sum of all even numbers in a list of integers, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initialize a Sum Variable**: Start by initializing a variable `sum` to zero. This variable will be used to keep track of the cumulative sum of even numbers.\n\n2. **Iterate Through the List**: Loop through each element of the list of integers. The list in this case is `numList[] = {4, 7, 2, 1, 9, 8, 3}`.\n\n3. **Check for Even Numbers**: For each element in the list, check if the number is even. A number is even if it is divisible by 2 without a remainder, which can be checked using the modulus operator (`%`). Specifically, if `numList[i] % 2 == 0`, then the number is even.\n\n4. **Sum the Even Numbers**: If the number is even, add it to the `sum` variable. This accumulates the sum of all the even numbers found during the iteration.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: After finishing the loop, the `sum` variable will contain the total sum of all even numbers in the list. Print this result to the console.\n\nIn the given code, these steps are implemented as follows:\n\n- The list of integers is stored in the array `numList[]`.\n- The `sum` variable is initialized to zero.\n- A `for` loop iterates over each element of `numList`, checking if each element is even using the condition `numList[i] % 2 == 0`.\n- If an element is even, it is added to the `sum`.\n- Finally, the sum of the even numbers is printed to the console.\n\nThe code correctly identifies that the even numbers in the list `{4, 7, 2, 1, 9, 8, 3}` are `4`, `2`, and `8`. When these numbers are added together, the sum is `4 + 2 + 8 = 14`. Therefore, the output of the program is: \"The sum of all even numbers in the list is: 14\"."
