My code is as follows:\n\n```python\ndf = pd.read_csv(CsvFileName)\n\np = df.pivot_table(index=['Hour'], columns='DOW', values='Changes', aggfunc=np.mean).round(0)\np.fillna(0, inplace=True)\n\np[[\"1Sun\", \"2Mon\", \"3Tue\", \"4Wed\", \"5Thu\", \"6Fri\", \"7Sat\"]] = p[[\"1Sun\", \"2Mon\", \"3Tue\", \"4Wed\", \"5Thu\", \"6Fri\", \"7Sat\"]].astype(int)\n```\n\nI've been using this code for a while and it has always been working until the CSV file doesn't have enough coverage (of all week days). For example, with a CSV file having following data:\n\n```\nDOW,Hour,Changes\n4Wed,01,237\n3Tue,07,2533\n1Sun,01,240\n3Tue,12,4407\n1Sun,09,2204\n1Sun,01,240\n1Sun,01,241\n1Sun,01,241\n3Tue,11,662\n4Wed,01,4\n2Mon,18,4737\n1Sun,15,240\n2Mon,02,4\n6Fri,01,1\n1Sun,01,240\n2Mon,19,2300\n2Mon,19,2532\n```\n\nI'm encountering a `KeyError: \"['5Thu' '7Sat'] not in index\"` error. I'm new to Python and I don't know how to fix this issue. Can someone guide me?"

        "content": "The `KeyError` you are encountering occurs because your pivot table does not have data for all the specified weekdays, particularly \"5Thu\" and \"7Sat\" in your case. To handle this scenario, you can modify your approach to ensure your code doesn't fail when certain columns are missing.\n\nHere's a way to handle it by checking which columns are present in the pivot table and only selecting those:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Assuming df is already created from the CSV file\ndf = pd.read_csv(CsvFileName)\n\n# Create the pivot table\np = df.pivot_table(index=['Hour'], columns='DOW', values='Changes', aggfunc=np.mean).round(0)\np.fillna(0, inplace=True)\n\n# List of all possible columns (weekdays)\nall_columns = [\"1Sun\", \"2Mon\", \"3Tue\", \"4Wed\", \"5Thu\", \"6Fri\", \"7Sat\"]\n\n# Find columns that actually exist in the pivot table\navailable_columns = [col for col in all_columns if col in p.columns]\n\n# Convert only the available columns to int\np[available_columns] = p[available_columns].astype(int)\n\nprint(p)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Pivot Table Creation**: We create a pivot table, as you did, aggregating by the mean and rounding.\n\n2. **Handle Missing Columns**: Instead of directly trying to access all the specified weekday columns, we first determine which of these columns are actually present in the pivot table.\n\n3. **Convert to Integer**: We then only convert the columns that are present to integers, avoiding the `KeyError`.\n\nThis approach ensures your code remains robust even when some weekdays are missing in your data."
