        "content": "Encountering an `ImportError` after installing a Python library is a common issue and can occur for several reasons. Here are some potential causes and solutions to help you resolve this problem:\n\n1. **Virtual Environment**: \n   - **Different Environments**: You might have installed the library in one Python environment but are trying to import it in another. Ensure that you are using the correct virtual environment by activating it before running your script.\n     - To activate a virtual environment, use the command:\n       - On Windows: `.\\venv\\Scripts\\activate`\n       - On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`\n   - **Check Environment**: Double-check that `pip` and `python` commands are pointing to the same environment. You can check this by running:\n     ```bash\n     which pip\n     which python\n     ```\n\n2. **Python Version**:\n   - Ensure that you are using the same Python version for both the installation and execution of your script. Sometimes, different versions (e.g., Python 2 and Python 3) might be used inadvertently.\n\n3. **Installation Confirmation**:\n   - Confirm that the library is installed correctly by listing installed packages:\n     ```bash\n     pip list\n     ```\n   - If the library is not listed, try reinstalling it.\n\n4. **Spelling and Case Sensitivity**:\n   - Double-check the spelling of the library name during import. Python package names are case-sensitive.\n\n5. **Path Issues**:\n   - If you have a custom or unusual Python setup, make sure the library's path is included in your `PYTHONPATH`. You can temporarily add it in your script:\n     ```python\n     import sys\n     sys.path.append('/path/to/library')\n     ```\n\n6. **IDE/Editor Configuration**:\n   - If you're using an IDE or editor, ensure it's configured to use the correct Python interpreter. Most modern IDEs allow you to set the interpreter path.\n\n7. **Restart Session**:\n   - Sometimes, a simple restart of the Python interpreter or your IDE can resolve the issue.\n\nIf you've checked all these possibilities and the issue persists, providing more specific details about your setup or the error message might help in diagnosing the problem further."
