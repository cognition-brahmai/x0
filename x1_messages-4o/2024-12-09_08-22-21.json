However, I'm encountering a problem when linking a simple g++ compilation to the .hpp files in the include directory. Here's how my compilation looks:\n\n```c++\ng++ -I /home/jack/caffe/include classification.cpp -o classify\n```\n\nHowever, I'm getting the following error:\n\n```c++\nIn file included from /home/jack/caffe/include/caffe/common.hpp:19:0,\n    from /home/jack/caffe/include/caffe/blob.hpp:8,\n    from /home/jack/caffe/include/caffe/caffe.hpp:7,\n    from classification.cpp:1:\n/home/jack/caffe/include/caffe/util/device_alternate.hpp:34:23: fatal error: cublas_v2.h: No such file or directory\n #include &lt;cublas_v2.h&gt;\n```\n\nI'm running this on a machine without Nvidia GPUs so when I looked at the device_alternate.hpp file, I realized this is calling a lot of CUDA-related .hpp files as well which don't exist. Can someone help me work out how to compile this program?"

        "content": "It seems like your program is trying to include CUDA-specific headers, which are not available on your machine since you don\u2019t have an NVIDIA GPU or CUDA installed. To resolve this issue, you'll need to configure your build to exclude CUDA dependencies. Here's how you can approach this:\n\n1. **Modify Caffe Configuration:**\n   Ensure that Caffe is configured to build without GPU support. You need to modify the Makefile.config in the root of your Caffe directory:\n\n   ```plaintext\n   # Uncomment this to use CPU only\n   CPU_ONLY := 1\n   ```\n\n   This tells Caffe to build without GPU support, thus excluding CUDA headers and libraries.\n\n2. **Recompile Caffe:**\n   After modifying the Makefile.config, recompile Caffe to ensure it builds all necessary files for CPU-only operation:\n\n   ```bash\n   make clean\n   make all\n   make test\n   make runtest\n   ```\n\n3. **Compile Your Program:**\n   When compiling your program, you need to link it against the Caffe and other libraries it depends on. Typically, this would include linking against libraries like `protobuf`, `glog`, `gflags`, `boost`, `opencv`, etc. Here\u2019s an example compilation command:\n\n   ```bash\n   g++ -I /home/jack/caffe/include -I /home/jack/caffe/build/include \\\n       -L /home/jack/caffe/build/lib -lcaffe -lglog -lgflags -lprotobuf -lopencv_core -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_imgcodecs \\\n       classification.cpp -o classify\n   ```\n\n   Make sure you replace the paths with the actual paths where these libraries are installed on your system.\n\n4. **Ensure Environment Variables:**\n   Make sure the library path is set in your environment by exporting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:\n\n   ```bash\n   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/jack/caffe/build/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n   ```\n\n5. **Check for Missing Dependencies:**\n   If you encounter other missing dependencies, ensure that all required libraries are installed on your system. You can usually install these using your package manager (`apt`, `yum`, `brew`, etc.).\n\nFollowing these steps should help you compile your Caffe-based project without needing CUDA. If you continue to face issues, double-check the configuration files and make sure all necessary libraries are correctly installed and linked."
