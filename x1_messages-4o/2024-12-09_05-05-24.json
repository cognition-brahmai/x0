The function `numpy.rank` seems to calculate the dimension of an array but I'm interested in finding the rank of a matrix. For example, given a matrix 'A':\n\n```python\nfrom numpy import matrix, rank\nA = matrix([[1,3,7],[2,8,3],[7,8,1]])\nprint(rank(A))\n```\nThe above code gives me `2` which is a dimension, but I'm looking for an answer of `3` which is the rank of the matrix 'A'. Is there a fundamental operation for this built into the matrix class?"

        "content": "To calculate the mathematical rank of a matrix using `scipy`, you can utilize the `scipy.linalg.matrix_rank` function. This function is specifically designed to compute the rank of a matrix, which is the number of linearly independent rows or columns in the matrix.\n\nHere's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.linalg import matrix_rank\n\n# Define the matrix\nA = np.matrix([[1, 3, 7], [2, 8, 3], [7, 8, 1]])\n\n# Calculate the rank of the matrix\nrank_of_A = matrix_rank(A)\n\nprint(rank_of_A)\n```\n\nIn this example, `matrix_rank(A)` will compute the rank of the matrix `A`, and it should return `3` for the matrix you've provided. The `matrix_rank` function uses singular value decomposition (SVD) to determine the rank, which is generally a very reliable method."
