        "content": "The error you're encountering often arises from compatibility issues between different Python versions. The `encoding` parameter should be supported in Python 3.x, but it seems like your environment might be using Python 2.x when running through the terminal. Here's how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Python 3 is being used**: First, make sure that your terminal is using Python 3. You can check this by running:\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   ```\n   or\n   ```bash\n   python3 --version\n   ```\n\n   If the version is not 3.x, you may need to explicitly run your script with Python 3 by using:\n   ```bash\n   python3 your_script.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Modify the shebang line**: At the top of your script, you can add a shebang line to specify Python 3:\n   ```python\n   #!/usr/bin/env python3\n   ```\n   Make sure this line is the very first line in your script.\n\n3. **Check for Python 3 installation**: If your system does not have Python 3 installed, you may need to install it.\n\n4. **Verify correct file usage**: Ensure that the file `gaeilge_flashcard_mode.txt` is indeed encoded in UTF-8. If not, convert it to UTF-8 using a text editor or a tool like `iconv`.\n\n5. **Correct the use of `quit`**: In your `Gaeilge` function, the condition `while x != quit:` should be `while x != 'quit':`.\n\n6. **Fix logical issues**: There's a logical error in your code when checking for correct answers. You should adjust the condition to:\n   ```python\n   for item in card[1][0]:  # Assuming card[1] is a list of translations\n       if x == item:\n           right = True\n           print(\"\\nCorrect!\")\n           numberCorrect += 1\n           break\n   ```\n\n7. **Ensure `flashcards` dictionary is used correctly**: Since `ImportGaeilge` initializes a new `flashcards` dictionary, it doesn't modify the global one. You should adjust the function to modify the global dictionary:\n   ```python\n   def ImportGaeilge():\n       global flashcards\n       with open('gaeilge_flashcard_mode.txt','r', encoding='utf8') as file:\n           for line in file:\n               line1 = line.rstrip().split(\"=\")\n               key = line1[0]\n               trans = line1[1]\n               PoS = line1[2]\n               Flashcards(key, trans, PoS)\n   ```\n\nAfter making these adjustments, your script should be able to read the file properly in a Python 3 environment through the terminal."
