        "content": "Yes, unbinding an object from an SQLAlchemy session and then adding it to another session can be a bit tricky, especially when dealing with association proxies. However, there are several approaches you can take to achieve this:\n\n1. **Expunge the Object:**\n   You can use the `expunge` method to remove the object from the session. Once expunged, the object can be added to another session.\n\n   ```python\n   session.expunge(obj)\n   new_session.add(obj)\n   ```\n\n2. **Use `make_transient`:**\n   The `make_transient` function can be used to detach an object from the session. This will make the object transient (i.e., it will act as though it has never been persisted).\n\n   ```python\n   from sqlalchemy.orm import make_transient\n\n   make_transient(obj)\n   new_session.add(obj)\n   ```\n\n   Note that `make_transient` will also reset the object's identity key, so it will be treated as a new object when added to a new session.\n\n3. **Copy and Re-add:**\n   If `deepcopy` is not working due to association proxies, you might manually copy the attributes you need to a new instance of the object and then add it to the new session.\n\n   ```python\n   new_obj = YourModel(attribute1=obj.attribute1, attribute2=obj.attribute2, ...)\n   new_session.add(new_obj)\n   ```\n\n   With this method, you need to be careful to manually copy all relevant attributes and relationships.\n\n4. **Use a Detached State:**\n   If you want to move the object with its current state, you can use a detached state where you first `expunge` the object and then add it to the new session.\n\n   ```python\n   session.expunge(obj)\n   new_session.add(obj)\n   new_session.flush()  # or commit\n   ```\n\nThese methods should help you move an object between sessions. Keep in mind that any changes made to the object while it was attached to the first session may need to be considered when adding it to the new session, especially if those changes haven't been flushed to the database."
