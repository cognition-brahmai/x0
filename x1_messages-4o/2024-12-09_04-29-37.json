This file serves as an initializer for the package and can be used to define what should be accessible when the package is imported.\n\nHere's what you need to do:\n\n1. Open the `__init__.py` file located in the `controllers` directory.\n\n2. Add the following line to import the `Project` class from the `project.py` module and make it accessible at the package level:\n\n   ```python\n   from .project import Project\n   ```\n\nNow, when you import `Project` from `app.controllers`, Python will look into the `__init__.py` file of the `controllers` package, where it will find the `Project` class imported from the `project` module.\n\nYour `__init__.py` file should look something like this:\n\n```python\n# app/controllers/__init__.py\n\nfrom .project import Project\n```\n\nWith this setup, you can now import the `Project` class in `app.py` using the following import statement:\n\n```python\nfrom app.controllers import Project\n```\n\nThis approach makes the `Project` class available at the package level, allowing you to import it directly from `app.controllers`."
