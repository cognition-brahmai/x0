I need the variable `self.id` internally as well, and it needs to be a number. However, I can't seem to find a way to make this code more Pythonic. Can anyone suggest a better approach? Here is the current code:\n\n```python\nglobal_next_id = 1\n\nclass Obj:\n  def __init__(self):\n    global global_next_id\n    self.id = global_next_id\n\n    global_next_id += 1\n```"

        "content": "To make the code more Pythonic and avoid using a global variable for tracking IDs, you can use a class-level attribute. This approach encapsulates the ID generation within the class itself, making it more modular and easier to manage. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nclass Obj:\n    # Class-level attribute to keep track of the next ID\n    _next_id = 1\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Assign the current ID and increment the class-level attribute\n        self.id = Obj._next_id\n        Obj._next_id += 1\n\n# Example usage\nobj1 = Obj()\nprint(obj1.id)  # Output: 1\n\nobj2 = Obj()\nprint(obj2.id)  # Output: 2\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Class-level Attribute**: `_next_id` is defined at the class level. This means it is shared among all instances of the class and is not specific to any single instance.\n\n2. **Initialization**: In the `__init__` method, each time a new instance of `Obj` is created, it gets the current value of `_next_id` and then increments it for the next instance.\n\n3. **Encapsulation**: By using a class attribute, we encapsulate the logic for ID generation within the class itself, avoiding the use of a global variable.\n\nThis approach is more Pythonic as it keeps related data and behavior encapsulated within the class, improving readability and maintainability."
