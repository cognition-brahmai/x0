I have both Python2.7 and Python3.2 installed on my system and the symbolic link 'python' is linked to Python2.7. When I use 'sudo pip install package-name', it defaults to installing the Python2 version of the package. How can I ensure that the Python3 version of the package is installed, given that some packages support both Python2 and Python3?"

        "content": "To ensure that you install the Python3 version of a package using pip on Ubuntu 12.04, where both Python 2.7 and Python 3.2 are installed, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Use `pip3` Instead of `pip`:**  \n   If you have `pip3` installed, you can simply use it to install packages for Python 3.2. You can do this by running:\n   ```bash\n   sudo pip3 install package-name\n   ```\n\n2. **Ensure `pip3` Is Installed:**  \n   If `pip3` is not installed, you can install it using `apt-get`. First, make sure that your package list is up-to-date:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   ```\n   Then, install `python3-pip`:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install python3-pip\n   ```\n\n3. **Use Python 3.2's `pip`:**  \n   If you have a specific version of Python and its corresponding `pip` installed, you can call it directly. For instance:\n   ```bash\n   sudo python3.2 -m pip install package-name\n   ```\n\n4. **Virtual Environments:**  \n   Another approach is to use a virtual environment for Python 3.2. This can help isolate your project dependencies and ensure you are using the correct version of Python. First, install the `virtualenv` package:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv\n   ```\n   Then, create a virtual environment using Python 3.2:\n   ```bash\n   virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.2 myenv\n   ```\n   Activate the virtual environment:\n   ```bash\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n   ```\n   Now, within this virtual environment, any `pip install` command will affect Python 3.2:\n   ```bash\n   pip install package-name\n   ```\n   To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:\n   ```bash\n   deactivate\n   ```\n\nBy following any of these methods, you can ensure that you're installing Python 3 versions of packages on your system."
