        "content": "How can I execute a single test from unittest.TestCase via the command line? I have a framework class \"ourtcfw.py\" and several test cases like \"testMyCase.py\". When I'm developing new test code and want to run it frequently, I usually put \"__\" in front of all other tests to save time. However, this method is cumbersome and it distracts me from the code I'm writing, not to mention the noise it creates during commit is annoying. For instance, when making changes to \"testItIsHot()\", I want to be able to execute only this test by running \"$ python testMyCase.py testItIsHot\" in the command line. I tried modifying the \"if __name__ == \"__main__\":\" section but since I'm new to Python, I'm having a hard time and keep running into issues with the methods. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To execute a single test from a `unittest.TestCase` via the command line, you can use the `unittest` module's command-line interface. You don't need to modify your test files for this purpose. Here's how you can run a specific test:\n\n1. Make sure your test class is derived from `unittest.TestCase`.\n2. Use the following command in the terminal to run a specific test method:\n\n```sh\npython -m unittest testMyCase.TestClassName.testItIsHot\n```\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of what each part means:\n- `python -m unittest` tells Python to run the `unittest` module as a script.\n- `testMyCase` is the name of your test file (without the `.py` extension).\n- `TestClassName` is the name of the class in your `testMyCase.py` file that contains the test method.\n- `testItIsHot` is the name of the test method you want to run.\n\nFor example, if your test file is `testMyCase.py` and it contains a class `WeatherTest` with a method `testItIsHot`, you would run:\n\n```sh\npython -m unittest testMyCase.WeatherTest.testItIsHot\n```\n\nThis command will only execute the specified test method, allowing you to focus on the specific test you are developing or debugging.\n\nIf you want to run all test methods in a specific class, you can omit the method name:\n\n```sh\npython -m unittest testMyCase.WeatherTest\n```\n\nThis setup allows you to avoid modifying your test files and keeps your source control clean from unnecessary changes."
