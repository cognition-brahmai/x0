I want the ship to move left and right with the left and right arrow keys. The ship is moving too fast, so I want it to move only one location at a time when the key is pressed. How can I achieve this? Here is my code:\n\n```python\nkeys=pygame.key.get_pressed()\nif keys[K_LEFT]:\n    location-=1\n    if location==-1:\n        location=0\nif keys[K_RIGHT]:\n    location+=1\n    if location==5:\n        location=4\n```"

        "content": "To make the ship move only one location at a time when a key is pressed, you need to detect the key press only once per key press event, rather than continuously while the key is held down. This can be achieved by handling the `KEYDOWN` event within the event loop instead of continuously checking `pygame.key.get_pressed()`.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nfor event in pygame.event.get():\n    if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n        running = False\n    elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:\n        if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:\n            location -= 1\n            if location < 0:\n                location = 0\n        elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:\n            location += 1\n            if location > 4:\n                location = 4\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Event Loop**: Use `pygame.event.get()` to retrieve events from the queue. Handle each event in the loop.\n- **KEYDOWN Event**: Check if the event type is `KEYDOWN` to detect a key press.\n- **Boundaries**: Ensure `location` stays within the valid range (0 to 4) after updating it.\n\nThis approach ensures that the ship's location changes only once per key press, providing the behavior you desire where the ship moves one column at a time."
