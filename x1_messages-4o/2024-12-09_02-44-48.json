Here's how you can do it:\n\n```bash\nmyvar=\"some string\"\nlength=${#myvar}\necho \"The length of the string is: $length\"\n```\n\nIn this example, `${#myvar}` computes the length of the string stored in `myvar`, and then the length is assigned to the variable `length`. The `echo` command is used to display the length of the string."
