Furthermore, I would like to know the equivalent file extension for Linux. Are there any differences between DLL and PYD apart from the filename? I came across an unofficial article, but I am having trouble finding an official article on this topic."

        "content": "When dealing with Python extensions written in C for Windows, you typically see two file extensions: `.pyd` and `.dll`. Here's a breakdown of their usage and differences:\n\n1. **.pyd File Extension:**\n   - A `.pyd` file is essentially a Windows DLL that is specifically intended to be imported as a Python module. It contains the compiled C code and is directly importable by Python. Using the `.pyd` extension makes it clear that the file is a Python dynamic module.\n   - Python recognizes `.pyd` files as modules, which allows you to import them using the standard `import` statement in Python.\n\n2. **.dll File Extension:**\n   - A `.dll` file, which stands for Dynamic Link Library, is a general-purpose file used to hold code and data that can be used by multiple programs simultaneously.\n   - While you can create a Python extension as a `.dll`, it requires additional work to ensure Python can recognize and load it as a module. This typically involves creating a `.pyd` wrapper or explicitly loading the DLL using libraries like `ctypes` or `cffi`.\n\n3. **Differences Between .pyd and .dll:**\n   - The key difference lies in the intended use and recognition by Python. A `.pyd` file is specifically structured and named to be used as a Python module, whereas a `.dll` does not have this specificity.\n   - Using `.pyd` simplifies the process of importing and using the module within Python, as Python\u2019s import machinery recognizes it out of the box.\n\n4. **Equivalent File Extension for Linux:**\n   - On Linux, the equivalent of a `.pyd` file is typically a shared object file with the extension `.so`. Like `.pyd` files, `.so` files are shared libraries that can be loaded and used by Python as modules.\n\nAs for finding official documentation, you might not find explicit documentation from Python.org detailing the differences between `.pyd` and `.dll` extensions. However, Python\u2019s documentation on extending and embedding Python with C/C++ can provide insights into how Python modules are structured and used. You can refer to the [Python C API documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/index.html) for more detailed information on creating Python extensions."
