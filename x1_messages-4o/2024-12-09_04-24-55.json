I have stored the start timestamp in milliseconds (Unix time) for each video. I'm able to retrieve the framerate for each video using OpenCV as follows:\n\n```python\nimport cv2\nvideo = cv2.VideoCapture(videoFile)\nfps = video.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)\n```\n\nNow, theoretically, I can add 1000/fps for each frame in the video. But this assumes that the framerate remains stable throughout the whole recording, and I am not sure if that's the case. So, is there a way in Python to get the timestamp (in milliseconds) of each frame in the video regardless of the framerate?"

        "content": "To calculate the timestamp for each frame in a video with varying framerates, you can use both OpenCV and ffmpeg, which can provide more detailed information about each frame. OpenCV assumes a constant frame rate, so it won't help if there's a variable frame rate. However, using ffmpeg, you can extract the exact presentation timestamp (PTS) for each frame. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using ffmpeg to extract frame data**:\n\nYou can use ffmpeg to dump frame information, including timestamps, into a text file. This command will provide you the frame-by-frame data:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 -vf showinfo -f null - 2> frame_info.txt\n```\n\nThe `showinfo` filter will print information about each frame, including the PTS (presentation timestamp), into `frame_info.txt`.\n\n2. **Parsing the frame data in Python**:\n\nOnce you have the frame data in a text file, you can parse it using Python to get the timestamps for each frame. Here's an example of how you might do this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef parse_frame_info(file_path):\n    timestamps = []\n    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n        for line in file:\n            # Extract the PTS time using a regular expression\n            match = re.search(r'pts_time:(\\d+\\.\\d+)', line)\n            if match:\n                # Convert the timestamp from seconds to milliseconds\n                timestamps.append(float(match.group(1)) * 1000)\n    return timestamps\n\n# Use the function to parse the frame info\nframe_timestamps = parse_frame_info('frame_info.txt')\nprint(frame_timestamps)\n```\n\n3. **Using the timestamps**:\n\nNow you have a list of timestamps in milliseconds for each frame, which reflects the actual presentation time of each frame in the video. This method will work even if the framerate is variable.\n\nRemember to install ffmpeg on your system if you haven't already. You can download it from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system."
