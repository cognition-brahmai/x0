Here's an example of a modified formula that adds the numbers in cells A1 and A2, multiplies the result by the number in cell A3, and then adds the value in cell A4:\n\n```excel\n=((A1 + A2) * A3) + A4\n```\n\nThis formula performs the following steps:\n1. Adds the values in cells A1 and A2.\n2. Multiplies the sum by the value in cell A3.\n3. Adds the result to the value in cell A4.\n\nFeel free to modify the cell references or include additional operations to suit your specific requirements!"
