        "content": "Certainly! To compute the total execution time of a MATLAB code snippet that displays \"Hello World\" for each iteration from 1 to 10 in a for-loop, you can use the `tic` and `toc` functions in MATLAB. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```matlab\n% Start the timer\ntic;\n\n% Number of iterations\nnumIterations = 10;\n\n% Loop to display \"Hello World\"\nfor i = 1:numIterations\n    disp('Hello World');\nend\n\n% Stop the timer and calculate elapsed time\nexecutionTime = toc;\n\n% Display the results\nfprintf('Total Execution Time: %.6f seconds\\n', executionTime);\nfprintf('Number of times \"Hello World\" is displayed: %d\\n', numIterations);\n```\n\nThis code will output the total execution time and the number of times \"Hello World\" is displayed. The `tic` function starts the timer, and `toc` stops it and returns the elapsed time. The `fprintf` function is used to format and display the results."
