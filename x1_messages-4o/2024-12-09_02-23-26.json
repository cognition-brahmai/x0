I am trying to select distances from `dists` which fall within a certain range using the `np.where` function. The code I am using is `dists[(np.where(dists >= r)) and (np.where(dists <= r + dr))]`, however, it seems to only fulfill the condition `(np.where(dists <= r + dr))`. When I try executing the commands sequentially using a temporary variable, it works perfectly. Why isn't the original code working and how can I fix it to work as intended?"

        "content": "The issue with your original code lies in the use of the `np.where` function and the logical `and` operator. When you use `np.where`, it returns a tuple of arrays (one for each dimension), and using `and` between these tuples is not the correct way to combine the conditions. Instead, you should perform element-wise logical operations directly on the array.\n\nHere's how you can fix your code to select distances within the specified range:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Assuming dists is your numpy array, and r and dr are the range parameters.\nmask = (dists >= r) & (dists <= r + dr)\nselected_dists = dists[mask]\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The condition `(dists >= r) & (dists <= r + dr)` creates a boolean mask where each element of `dists` is checked against the range conditions.\n- `&` is used for element-wise logical AND operation between the two conditions.\n- The resulting boolean mask is then used to index the array `dists` to select only the elements that satisfy both conditions.\n\nThis approach avoids using `np.where` unnecessarily and directly applies the conditions to filter the array."
