You can define your own operators using standard C++. The CUDA SDK includes a header \"cutil_math.h\" that defines some common operations on the vector types. However, I am unable to find this using CUDA SDK 5.0. Has it been renamed or removed? Additionally, I've found a version of the header here. How is this version related to the one that's supposed to come with SDK?"

        "content": "In CUDA SDK 5.0 and later versions, the \"cutil\" library, which included \"cutil_math.h,\" was deprecated and removed. The reason for this was to simplify the SDK and reduce dependencies on utility libraries that were not part of the core CUDA toolkit. The \"cutil\" utilities were intended mainly for the SDK samples and not for production use, which led to their removal.\n\nHowever, developers often found the utility functions and vector operations defined in \"cutil_math.h\" useful. As a result, some of these functionalities can be found in community-provided versions or in the public domain, similar to the version you mentioned. These versions typically provide similar functionality by defining operators and functions for CUDA vector types like `float4`, `int3`, etc.\n\nIf you're looking for vector operations, you can either:\n\n1. **Write Your Own Utility Functions**: You can define the necessary operators and functions for CUDA vector types in your own utility header files. This is straightforward and gives you control over the specific operations you need.\n\n2. **Use a Community Version**: If you find a version of \"cutil_math.h\" from a reliable source, you can use it as long as it suits your needs and is compatible with your CUDA version.\n\n3. **Explore Thrust or Other Libraries**: CUDA's Thrust library is a parallel algorithms library that provides many utilities and abstractions for CUDA programming. While Thrust doesn't directly replace \"cutil_math.h,\" it offers a range of functionality that could be useful, depending on your application.\n\nIn summary, if you find a version of \"cutil_math.h\" that works for you, it can be used in place of the deprecated one, but you'll need to ensure it aligns with your current CUDA version and requirements."
