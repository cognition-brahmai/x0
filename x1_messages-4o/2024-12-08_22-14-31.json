The first building is 50 meters tall, the second building is 30 meters tall, the third building is 20 meters tall, the fourth building is 60 meters tall, and the fifth building is 10 meters tall. Suddenly, a heavy rainfall pours down for 3 hours, causing the water level to rise 10 meters high. How much of each building's height is still visible above the floodwater? \nHint: Consider how the different heights of the buildings would affect the amount of the building still visible above the water level."

        "content": "To determine how much of each building's height is still visible above the floodwater, we need to subtract the water level rise (10 meters) from the height of each building. Here are the calculations for each building:\n\n1. **First Building:**\n   - Original Height: 50 meters\n   - Water Level: 10 meters\n   - Visible Height: 50 - 10 = 40 meters\n\n2. **Second Building:**\n   - Original Height: 30 meters\n   - Water Level: 10 meters\n   - Visible Height: 30 - 10 = 20 meters\n\n3. **Third Building:**\n   - Original Height: 20 meters\n   - Water Level: 10 meters\n   - Visible Height: 20 - 10 = 10 meters\n\n4. **Fourth Building:**\n   - Original Height: 60 meters\n   - Water Level: 10 meters\n   - Visible Height: 60 - 10 = 50 meters\n\n5. **Fifth Building:**\n   - Original Height: 10 meters\n   - Water Level: 10 meters\n   - Visible Height: 10 - 10 = 0 meters\n\nTherefore, the visible heights of the buildings above the floodwater are 40 meters, 20 meters, 10 meters, 50 meters, and 0 meters, respectively. The fifth building is completely submerged."
