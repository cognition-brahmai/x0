I want to create a new column C using the following rules: If the value in column A is not null, use that value for the new column C. If the value in column A is null, use the value in column B for the new column C. I know this can be done in SQL Server using the coalesce function, is there a Python equivalent for this operation?"

        "content": "Yes, in Python, you can achieve this using the `pandas` library, which provides a convenient way to handle such operations. You can use the `fillna()` method or the `combine_first()` method to accomplish this task. Here's how you can do it:\n\nLet's assume your DataFrame is named `df` and the columns are `A` and `B`. You want to create a new column `C` based on the rules you described.\n\n### Using `fillna()`:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {'A': [1, None, 3, None, 5],\n        'B': [None, 2, None, 4, None]}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Create column C\ndf['C'] = df['A'].fillna(df['B'])\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\n### Using `combine_first()`:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {'A': [1, None, 3, None, 5],\n        'B': [None, 2, None, 4, None]}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Create column C\ndf['C'] = df['A'].combine_first(df['B'])\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nBoth methods will give you the same result, where column `C` will have values from column `A` if they are not null, and from column `B` if the values in `A` are null. The `combine_first()` method is essentially equivalent to the `COALESCE()` function in SQL."
