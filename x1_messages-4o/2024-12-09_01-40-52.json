I have a simple class in Python as follows:\n\n```python\nclass Wharrgarbl(object):\n    def __init__(self, a, b, c, sum, version='old'):\n        self.a = a\n        self.b = b\n        self.c = c\n        self.sum = 6\n        self.version = version\n\n    def __int__(self):\n        return self.sum + 9000\n\n    def __what_goes_here__(self):\n        return {'a': self.a, 'b': self.b, 'c': self.c}\n```\n\nI can cast it to an integer easily as follows:\n\n```python\n>>> w = Wharrgarbl('one', 'two', 'three', 6)\n>>> int(w)\n9006\n```\n\nHowever, when I cast it to a dictionary, I encounter an error:\n\n```python\n>>> w = Wharrgarbl('one', 'two', 'three', 6)\n>>> dict(w)\nTypeError: Wharrgarbl object is not iterable\n```\n\nI tried substituting both `__dict__` and `dict` for `__what_goes_here__` but `dict(w)` still resulted in a `TypeError`. I don't want to simply make the class iterable, as that won't solve my problem. How can I cast my class object to a dictionary that only includes certain attributes (in this case, 'a', 'b', and 'c') and excludes others (like 'sum' and 'version')?"

        "content": "To convert an instance of your class to a dictionary with only certain attributes, you can define a custom method in your class that returns a dictionary representation of the desired attributes. You can then call this method when you want to get the dictionary representation of your object.\n\nHere's how you can modify your class to achieve this:\n\n```python\nclass Wharrgarbl(object):\n    def __init__(self, a, b, c, sum, version='old'):\n        self.a = a\n        self.b = b\n        self.c = c\n        self.sum = sum\n        self.version = version\n\n    def __int__(self):\n        return self.sum + 9000\n\n    def to_dict(self):\n        return {'a': self.a, 'b': self.b, 'c': self.c}\n\n# Usage\nw = Wharrgarbl('one', 'two', 'three', 6)\ndict_representation = w.to_dict()\nprint(dict_representation)\n```\n\nIn this code, the `to_dict` method is defined to return a dictionary with only the attributes `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`. You can call this method on an instance of `Wharrgarbl` to get the desired dictionary representation.\n\nThis approach avoids using special methods like `__dict__` or making the class iterable, which aren't necessary for your use case. With `to_dict`, you have control over exactly which attributes are included in the dictionary representation."
