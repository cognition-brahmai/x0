The error trace is as follows:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/etc/mongodb/server/cgi-bin/getstats.py\", line 135, in <module>\n    print json.dumps(\u200b\u200b__get\u200bdata())\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/json/__init__.py\", line 231, in dumps\n    return _default_encoder.encode(obj)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/json/encoder.py\", line 201, in encode\n    chunks = self.iterencode(o, _one_shot=True)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/json/encoder.py\", line 264, in iterencode\n    return _iterencode(o, 0)\nUnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0xa5 in position 0: invalid start byte\n```\n\nThe `__get\u200bdata()` function returns a dictionary. I identified that the following line of code is causing the issue:\n\n```\nnow = datetime.datetime.now()\nnow = datetime.datetime.strftime(now, '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ')\nprint json.dumps({'current_time': now}) # this is the culprit\n```\n\nI found a temporary solution by encoding the string:\n\n```\nprint json.dumps( {'old_time': now.encode('ISO-8859-1').strip() })\n```\n\nHowever, I am not sure if this is the correct way to fix it. Can you please provide a proper solution?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is related to encoding problems when you try to serialize a Python object into a JSON string. The `UnicodeDecodeError` suggests that the data you are trying to encode has non-UTF-8 bytes, which JSON does not support by default.\n\nHere's a more detailed and proper solution to handle this:\n\n1. **Ensure All Strings Are UTF-8 Encoded**: When dealing with JSON in Python, ensure that all strings are UTF-8 encoded. If you have strings that are not properly encoded, you'll encounter errors like the one you see.\n\n2. **Handle Different Encodings**: If your data might contain non-UTF-8 encoded strings, you can handle them before serialization.\n\n3. **Use `ensure_ascii` in `json.dumps`**: If you want to ensure that all output is ASCII, you can use the `ensure_ascii` parameter. This will escape all non-ASCII characters:\n\n   ```python\n   print(json.dumps({'current_time': now}, ensure_ascii=True))\n   ```\n\n4. **Explicitly Decode Using Correct Encoding**: If you know the encoding of your data, decode it properly before serialization.\n\n5. **Sanitize Input Data**: If possible, sanitize your input data to ensure it doesn't contain invalid characters or bytes.\n\nHere is how you can apply these suggestions to your code:\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport datetime\n\n# Assuming now is the datetime string you are creating\nnow = datetime.datetime.now()\nnow = datetime.datetime.strftime(now, '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ')\n\n# Ensure the string is UTF-8 encoded\ntry:\n    # Attempt to decode if it's a byte string, assuming ISO-8859-1 encoding\n    now = now.decode('ISO-8859-1')\nexcept AttributeError:\n    # If it's already a unicode string, or if decode fails, just proceed\n    pass\n\n# Use json.dumps with ensure_ascii to avoid encoding issues\nprint(json.dumps({'current_time': now}, ensure_ascii=True))\n```\n\nBy using `ensure_ascii=True`, you ensure that the output is ASCII-only, which avoids issues with non-UTF-8 characters. This is typically a good approach when you're unsure of the encoding of your input data or when you want to ensure compatibility across different systems and platforms."
