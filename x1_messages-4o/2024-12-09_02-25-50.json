I've read other threads discussing similar errors, but those seem to deal with either user-created classes or built-in system resources. In my case, I am running a loop to draw boxes using the `Horizontol_drawbox` and `Vertical_drawbox` functions. The error arises when I call these functions. I am struggling to understand the source of this problem. Any ideas? Here is the piece of code that's causing the trouble:\n\n```python\nBOX_LENGTH = 100\nturtle.speed(0)\nfill = 0\nfor i in range(8):\n    fill += 1\n    if fill % 2 == 0:\n        Horizontol_drawbox(BOX_LENGTH, fillBox = False)\n    else:\n        Horizontol_drawbox(BOX_LENGTH, fillBox = True)\n\n    for i in range(8):\n        fill += 1\n        if fill % 2 == 0:\n            Vertical_drawbox(BOX_LENGTH,fillBox = False)\n        else:\n            Vertical_drawbox(BOX_LENGTH,fillBox = True)\n```\n\nAnd here is the error message I am getting:\n\n```python\n    Horizontol_drawbox(BOX_LENGTH, fillBox = True)\nTypeError: Horizontol_drawbox() got multiple values for argument 'fillBox'\n```"

        "content": "The error message `Horizontol_drawbox() got multiple values for argument 'fillBox'` typically indicates that there is a conflict in the way arguments are being passed to the function. This usually happens when a positional argument and a keyword argument are both used to provide a value for the same parameter.\n\nHere's what you should check in your `Horizontol_drawbox` function definition:\n\n1. **Function Definition:** Ensure that the `Horizontol_drawbox` function is defined correctly and that it doesn\u2019t have multiple parameters that could potentially overlap with the `fillBox` keyword argument.\n\n2. **Parameter Order:** Check whether `fillBox` is defined in the function and observe how the parameters are ordered. If `fillBox` is a positional argument, ensure it is not being passed twice, once as a positional and once as a keyword argument.\n\n3. **Default Values:** Make sure that if `fillBox` has a default value, you are not inadvertently overwriting it by passing an additional value.\n\nHere is an example of what the function definition might mistakenly look like:\n\n```python\ndef Horizontol_drawbox(length, fillBox=True, fillBox=False):\n    # Function implementation\n```\n\nThe above definition would cause a conflict because `fillBox` is defined twice, once with a default value and once as a keyword argument.\n\nHere\u2019s how you might correct the function definition:\n\n```python\ndef Horizontol_drawbox(length, fillBox=True):\n    # Function implementation\n```\n\nAdditionally, here are a few things to check:\n\n- **Naming Conflicts:** Make sure there are no naming conflicts or shadowing of variables within your function or module that might cause a confusion in parameter passing.\n- **Positional Arguments:** Ensure that the `BOX_LENGTH` is not inadvertently being assigned to the `fillBox` parameter due to positional argument misalignment.\n\nCheck these aspects of your code, and if the problem persists, you may need to share the function definition for a more detailed analysis."
