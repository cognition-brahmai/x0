Here is a simple and efficient way to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Your original array\na = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])\n\n# Specify the index to exclude\nindex_to_exclude = 3\n\n# Use np.delete to remove the element at the specified index\na_modified = np.delete(a, index_to_exclude)\n\nprint(a_modified)\n```\n\nThe `np.delete()` function is the most straightforward way to remove an element at a specific index from a NumPy array. It returns a new array with the specified index removed, while the original array remains unchanged. This method is both efficient and easy to understand."
