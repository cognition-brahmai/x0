        "content": "I recently started learning about multiprocessing in Python and came across some unexpected behavior. I'm working on an application that uploads large files (over 100mb) to Amazon s3 buckets and for this, I'm using parallel uploads with the 'pool' option from the 'multiprocessing' module. My machine is a core i7 with a 'cpu_count' of 8, and my understanding was that if I set 'pool = Pool(process = 6)', I'd be using 6 cores and the file would upload in 6 parts simultaneously. However, when I tried setting the 'process' to 20 (meaning I want to use 20 cores), no errors were thrown and the program began uploading 20 parts simultaneously using a smaller 'chunk size'. I don't understand how this is possible as my machine only has 8 cores. Does 'process=6' actually mean it's using 6 threads? I based my code off a version I found on this website: http://www.topfstedt.de/python-parallel-s3-multipart-upload-with-retries.html, with the only change being that I ask the user for their preferred core usage instead of setting 'parallel_processes' to 4."

        "content": "When you're using the `multiprocessing` module in Python, it's essential to understand the distinction between processes and threads. The `Pool` class in the `multiprocessing` module creates a pool of worker processes, not threads. This means that setting `processes=6` in `Pool(processes=6)` creates 6 separate Python processes, potentially utilizing multiple CPU cores.\n\nLet's address your specific observations:\n\n1. **Processes vs. Threads**: The `multiprocessing` module uses processes, not threads. Each process runs independently and has its own Python interpreter and memory space. This is different from threads, which share the same memory space.\n\n2. **Number of Processes vs. Number of Cores**: Setting `processes=20` means you're creating 20 separate processes, but it doesn't mean you're using 20 cores. On an 8-core machine, the operating system schedules these processes on the available cores. This can lead to context switching, where the OS switches between processes, giving the illusion that more processes are running simultaneously than there are cores.\n\n3. **CPU Utilization**: Even if you create more processes than you have cores, the OS will manage these processes by time-slicing, which allows multiple processes to make progress concurrently. However, having too many processes can lead to inefficiencies due to overhead from context switching.\n\n4. **I/O-Bound vs. CPU-Bound Tasks**: Uploading files to Amazon S3 is an I/O-bound task, not CPU-bound. This means that the task is limited by the speed of the network and disk I/O rather than CPU processing power. In such cases, having more processes than cores can be beneficial because while one process is waiting for I/O operations to complete, others can execute.\n\n5. **Optimal Number of Processes**: For I/O-bound tasks, experiment with the number of processes to find the optimal balance. Although your machine has 8 cores, using more processes than cores can sometimes improve throughput for I/O-bound tasks, but be cautious about setting it too high to avoid excessive context switching and memory usage.\n\nTo summarize, using `Pool(processes=20)` doesn't mean you're using 20 cores; it means you're using 20 processes, with the OS managing their execution on your 8-core machine. For an I/O-bound task like uploading to S3, having more processes than cores can be effective, but it's essential to find the right balance for your specific application and environment."
