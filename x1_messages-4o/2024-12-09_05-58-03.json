        "content": "To convert a DataFrame's index from `float64` to `string` or `unicode`, you should convert the index to a string representation explicitly. You can achieve this by using the `astype(str)` method, which is commonly used in Python 3 since `unicode` is not a separate type; strings are inherently Unicode.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can convert the index to a string:\n\n```python\n# Check the type of the index\nprint(type(df.index))\n\n# Convert the index to string\ndf.index = df.index.astype(str)\n\n# Verify the conversion\nprint(type(df.index))\n```\n\nThis will change the DataFrame's index from `Float64Index` to `Index` with `dtype=object`, which stores string data.\n\nIn Python 3, using `str` will handle Unicode by default, so there's no need to use `unicode`, which was used in Python 2. Make sure you are using Python 3, as Python 2 has reached the end of its life and is no longer supported."
