My current query is as follows:\n\n```python\nStock.query.filter(Stock.ticker.in_(new_tickers)).delete()\n```\nHere, `new_tickers` is a list of strings representing valid tickers. However, when running this query, I am encountering an error that says: \n\n```python\nsqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: Could not evaluate current criteria in Python: \"Cannot evaluate clauselist with operator <function comma_op at 0x1104e4730>\". Specify 'fetch' or False for the synchronize_session parameter.\n```\nHow can I correct this issue and successfully delete the stocks from the database?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering typically arises because SQLAlchemy needs to know how to synchronize the session with the database when performing a bulk delete operation. By default, SQLAlchemy tries to evaluate the criteria for session synchronization in Python, which can lead to issues when dealing with complex expressions or specific configurations.\n\nTo resolve this, you need to specify the `synchronize_session` parameter in the `delete()` method. You have two main options:\n\n1. **Use `synchronize_session='fetch'`:** This option will first fetch the records that match the criteria to synchronize the session. It's slower but safer, ensuring the session is in sync after the operation.\n\n2. **Use `synchronize_session=False`:** This option will skip session synchronization. It's faster but can lead to inconsistencies if the session is used afterwards without a refresh or if the objects are not explicitly expired.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use either of these options:\n\n```python\n# Option 1: Using 'fetch'\nStock.query.filter(Stock.ticker.in_(new_tickers)).delete(synchronize_session='fetch')\n\n# Option 2: Using False\nStock.query.filter(Stock.ticker.in_(new_tickers)).delete(synchronize_session=False)\n```\n\nAfter performing the deletion, don't forget to commit the transaction to make the changes persistent in the database:\n\n```python\ndb.session.commit()\n```\n\nChoose the option based on your application's requirements. If you're unsure, starting with `synchronize_session='fetch'` is a good idea to ensure consistency."
