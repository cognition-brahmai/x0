The activities should be selected from a list of outdoor and indoor activities that require high levels of physical strength or mental ability such as hiking, rock climbing, white water rafting, escape room, zip-lining, mountain biking, kayaking, sailing, skiing and snowboarding. Please make sure that the selected activities cover both physical and mental demands. You can utilize the given Java code and customize it to fit the new requirements."

        "content": "To modify the Java code to meet your requirements, we need to generate a list of weekend getaway options, each including at least two physically demanding and two mentally challenging activities. We'll start by defining the list of activities and then create combinations that fit the criteria.\n\nHere is an example of how you can modify the Java code:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.Arrays;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.Random;\n\npublic class WeekendGetawayOptions {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        List<String> physicallyDemandingActivities = Arrays.asList(\n                \"Hiking\", \"Rock Climbing\", \"White Water Rafting\", \n                \"Zip-lining\", \"Mountain Biking\", \"Kayaking\", \n                \"Skiing\", \"Snowboarding\"\n        );\n\n        List<String> mentallyChallengingActivities = Arrays.asList(\n                \"Escape Room\", \"Sailing\"\n        );\n\n        List<List<String>> weekendGetaways = generateWeekendGetaways(\n                physicallyDemandingActivities, mentallyChallengingActivities);\n\n        printWeekendGetaways(weekendGetaways);\n    }\n\n    public static List<List<String>> generateWeekendGetaways(\n            List<String> physicalActivities, List<String> mentalActivities) {\n        \n        Random random = new Random();\n        List<List<String>> getaways = new ArrayList<>();\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n            List<String> getaway = new ArrayList<>();\n\n            // Select 2 physically demanding activities\n            while (getaway.size() < 2) {\n                String activity = physicalActivities.get(random.nextInt(physicalActivities.size()));\n                if (!getaway.contains(activity)) {\n                    getaway.add(activity);\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Select 2 mentally challenging activities\n            while (getaway.size() < 4) {\n                String activity = mentalActivities.get(random.nextInt(mentalActivities.size()));\n                if (!getaway.contains(activity)) {\n                    getaway.add(activity);\n                }\n            }\n\n            getaways.add(getaway);\n        }\n\n        return getaways;\n    }\n\n    public static void printWeekendGetaways(List<List<String>> getaways) {\n        for (int i = 0; i < getaways.size(); i++) {\n            System.out.println(\"Weekend Getaway Option \" + (i + 1) + \": \" + getaways.get(i));\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Lists of Activities**: We define two lists, `physicallyDemandingActivities` and `mentallyChallengingActivities`, containing the specified activities.\n- **Random Selection**: We use a `Random` object to select activities randomly from these lists.\n- **Loop through Options**: We generate five weekend getaway options. For each option, we randomly select two unique activities from the physically demanding list and two from the mentally challenging list, ensuring no duplicates in a single getaway.\n- **Output**: Each getaway option is printed to the console, showing the selected combination of activities.\n\nThis code gives you a basis for generating varied and exciting weekend getaway options that meet your specified criteria."
