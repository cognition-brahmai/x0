I attempted to resolve this by installing 'xlrd' with 'pip install xlrd', but it says 'Requirement already satisfied: xlrd in ./anaconda2/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages'. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that `xlrd` is installed for Python 2.7, but not for Python 3.4.3, which is the version you're currently using in PyCharm. To resolve this, you need to ensure that `xlrd` is installed for the Python 3.4.3 environment. Here's how you can do that:\n\n1. **Activate the correct Python environment**:\n   Make sure that your PyCharm project is set to use Python 3.4.3 as the interpreter. You can verify and change this in PyCharm by going to `File > Settings > Project: <Your Project Name> > Project Interpreter`.\n\n2. **Install xlrd for Python 3.4.3**:\n   Open a terminal and explicitly use Python 3.4.3's `pip` to install `xlrd`:\n\n   ```sh\n   python3.4 -m pip install xlrd\n   ```\n\n   Alternatively, if `python3.4` isn't recognized, you can use the full path to the Python interpreter. You can find this path in the PyCharm settings mentioned above.\n\n3. **Verify Installation**:\n   After installation, verify that `xlrd` is available by running:\n\n   ```sh\n   python3.4 -c \"import xlrd\"\n   ```\n\n   If there are no errors, the installation was successful.\n\n4. **Re-run your code**:\n   Once `xlrd` is installed for Python 3.4.3, re-run your code in PyCharm to check if the error is resolved.\n\nFollowing these steps should help you successfully read Excel files using Pandas in your Python 3.4.3 environment."
