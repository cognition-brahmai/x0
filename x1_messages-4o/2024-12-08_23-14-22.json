        "content": "Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases. It is a major aspect of climate change, which encompasses global temperature rise as well as its broader effects on weather patterns and ecosystems.\n\nKey factors contributing to global warming include:\n\n1. **Greenhouse Gases**: These gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), trap heat in the atmosphere and prevent it from escaping into space. This greenhouse effect is natural and necessary for life, but human activities have significantly increased the concentration of these gases.\n\n2. **Burning of Fossil Fuels**: The combustion of coal, oil, and natural gas for energy and transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. This releases significant amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere.\n\n3. **Deforestation**: Trees absorb CO2, so cutting them down for agriculture, logging, or urban development reduces the planet's capacity to manage carbon dioxide levels.\n\n4. **Industrial Processes**: Many industrial activities release greenhouse gases, including those related to manufacturing, mining, and chemical production.\n\n5. **Agriculture**: Agricultural practices, including rice production and livestock farming, contribute methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Fertilizers also release nitrous oxide.\n\nThe consequences of global warming are far-reaching and include rising sea levels, more frequent and severe weather events (such as hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves), loss of biodiversity, and impacts on food security and water resources. Global efforts are underway to mitigate these effects by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable practices."
