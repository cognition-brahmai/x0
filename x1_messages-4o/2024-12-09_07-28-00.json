        "content": "The error you're encountering is likely due to an incompatibility between the versions of TensorFlow and Keras you're using. The specific error message, `AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'control_flow_ops'`, suggests that there are changes in TensorFlow that are not compatible with the version of Keras you have installed. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Upgrade TensorFlow and Keras:**\n   The versions you are using (TensorFlow 0.11.0rc0 and Keras 1.1.0) are quite outdated. You should upgrade to more recent versions, as many improvements and bug fixes have been made since then. You can upgrade them using the following commands:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade tensorflow keras --user\n   ```\n\n   Ensure you have the latest stable versions. As of October 2023, TensorFlow 2.x and Keras 2.x are the stable versions.\n\n2. **Update Your Code:**\n   With the newer versions, the code in the GitHub example might need to be updated. For example:\n   - Import statements might need to change. For instance, you'll often use `from tensorflow.keras import ...` instead of `from keras import ...`.\n   - The model and layer definitions might need adjustments to conform to the TensorFlow 2.x and Keras 2.x APIs.\n   - If the code is using `tf.control_flow_ops`, it may need to be revised to use `tf.compat.v1` if you are working with TensorFlow 2.x in a compatibility mode.\n\n3. **Verify the Installation:**\n   Ensure that both TensorFlow and Keras are installed correctly and are not conflicting. You can verify this by running:\n\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n   import keras\n   print(tf.__version__)\n   print(keras.__version__)\n   ```\n\n   Make sure the versions printed are the ones you expect.\n\n4. **Check for Code Updates:**\n   Sometimes, the example scripts on GitHub are updated to work with the latest versions. Check the repository for any updates or patches that might address compatibility issues.\n\n5. **Run a Simple Example:**\n   Before running the MNIST example, try running a simple Keras model to ensure your setup is working correctly. For example, try building and training a simple sequential model with dummy data to verify everything is functioning.\n\nFollowing these steps should help you resolve the compatibility issue and successfully run the Keras script with TensorFlow."
