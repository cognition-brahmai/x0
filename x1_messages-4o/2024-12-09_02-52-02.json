I have a namespaced reusable application, Ella, included into my URLs like this:\n\n```python\nurlpatterns = patterns('',\n    # ella urls\n    url('^ella/', include('ella.core.urls', namespace=\"ella\")),\n)\n```\n\nThe Ella applications has URLs defined as follows:\n\n```python\nurlpatterns = patterns( '',\n    url( r'^(?P<category>[a-z0-9-/]+)/$', category_detail, name=\"category_detail\" ),\n    # object detail\n    url( r'^(?P<category>[a-z0-9-/]+)/(?P<year>\\d{4})/(?P<month>\\d{1,2})/(?P<day>\\d{1,2})/(?P<content_type>[a-z0-9-]+)/(?P<slug>[a-z0-9-]+)/$',\n        object_detail, name=\"object_detail\" )\n)\n```\n\nWhen I try to call `{% url ella:category_detail category=\"cat\" %}`, everything works fine. However, when an object tries to generate a link to its details using the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom django.core.urlresolvers import reverse\nurl = reverse('object_detail', kwargs={'required' : 'params'})\n```\n\nit doesn't work. I have to rewrite it as:\n\n```python\nfrom django.core.urlresolvers import reverse\nurl = reverse('ella:object_detail', kwargs={'required' : 'params'})\n```\n\nMy understanding is that including a reusable application into a namespace breaks all inner reverse()s inside the given application. Is that correct? What am I missing? Is there a way to work around this?"

        "content": "Yes, you're correct in your understanding that namespacing in Django URLs changes how you need to refer to those URLs when reversing them. When you include a namespaced URL configuration like `ella` in your Django project, you must always use the namespace when reversing URLs for that application. This behavior is by design and is meant to prevent naming collisions between applications.\n\nHere's a quick breakdown of what's happening:\n\n1. **Namespacing**: When you include URLs with a namespace (`namespace=\"ella\"`), it essentially prefixes all the URL names within that included URL configuration with the namespace. Therefore, you must use the namespace when reversing those URLs.\n\n2. **Reversing URLs**: When you want to reverse a URL within a namespaced application, you need to prefix the URL name with the namespace, i.e., `ella:object_detail`.\n\n3. **Inner Reverse Calls**: If you have reverse calls within your Ella application that do not use the namespace, they will not work as expected once the URL configuration is included with a namespace in your main `urlpatterns`.\n\nTo work around this and ensure that your application is reusable and can be included with or without a namespace, you can:\n\n- **Use Namespaced Reversal**: Always use the namespace when reversing URLs within your application.\n\n- **Conditional Namespace Handling**: You can use Django's ability to handle namespaces programmatically. For instance, you could pass the namespace as a parameter to your application and use it in reverse calls. However, this would require you to make changes to how your application handles URL reversing, potentially making it more complex.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\ndef get_object_detail_url(namespace=None, **kwargs):\n    if namespace:\n        return reverse(f'{namespace}:object_detail', kwargs=kwargs)\n    return reverse('object_detail', kwargs=kwargs)\n```\n\nThis way, you can accommodate both namespaced and non-namespaced usages of your application. However, the simplest and most consistent approach when working within a Django project is to always use the namespace if you have defined one."
