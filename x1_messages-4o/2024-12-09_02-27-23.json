Can someone assist me in identifying the issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that `pickle.load()` expects a file object opened in binary mode, but you're opening the file in text mode. To resolve this, you should open the file in binary mode for both reading and writing. Here's how you can correct your code:\n\n1. Open the file in binary read mode (`'rb'`) when loading with `pickle.load()`.\n2. Open the file in binary write mode (`'wb'`) when dumping with `pickle.dump()`.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport pickle\n\n# Assume 'username' and 'cached' are defined elsewhere in your code\nfname1 = \"auth_cache_%s\" % username\n# Remove the encode if you want to keep it as a string\n# fname=fname1.encode(encoding='utf_8')\nfname = fname1  \n\nif os.path.isfile(fname) and cached:\n    with open(fname, 'rb') as f:\n        response = pickle.load(f)\nelse:\n    response = self.heartbeat()\n    with open(fname, 'wb') as f:\n        pickle.dump(response, f)\n```\n\n**Key changes:**\n\n- Use `'rb'` mode for reading with `pickle.load()`.\n- Use `'wb'` mode for writing with `pickle.dump()`.\n- Use `with` statements to handle file opening, which ensures files are properly closed after their blocks are executed.\n\nThese changes should resolve the `TypeError` you're encountering."
