I have tried both `setuptools` and `poetry` for the build system and I am getting the same error for both. The error message is \"ERROR: Project file:///tmp/demo has a 'pyproject.toml' and its build backend is missing the 'build_editable' hook. Since it does not have a 'setup.py' nor a 'setup.cfg', it cannot be installed in editable mode. Consider using a build backend that supports PEP 660.\" I'm using a `conda` environment and my versions of `setuptools` and `pip` are 58.3.0 and 21.3.1 respectively."

        "content": "To install a project in editable mode using `pip` with a `pyproject.toml` file, you need to ensure that the build backend you are using supports PEP 660, which adds support for editable installs.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to achieving this:\n\n### 1. Upgrade Your Tools\nEnsure that you have the latest versions of `pip` and `setuptools`. PEP 660 support was added in later versions, so updating might resolve the issue.\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade pip setuptools\n```\n\n### 2. Use a Compatible Build Backend\nTo install a project in editable mode, the build backend defined in `pyproject.toml` must support PEP 660. Some popular backends like `setuptools` and `poetry` have added support for this in their newer versions. \n\n#### Using `setuptools`\n\nEnsure your `pyproject.toml` includes `setuptools` as the build backend. Here\u2019s a minimal example:\n\n```toml\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"setuptools>=61.0\", \"wheel\"]\nbuild-backend = \"setuptools.build_meta\"\n```\n\n#### Using `poetry`\n\nIf you are using `poetry`, ensure you have a version that supports PEP 660. You might need to update `poetry` as well:\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade poetry\n```\n\n### 3. Install in Editable Mode\n\nOnce your `pyproject.toml` is correctly configured and your tools are updated, you can install your project in editable mode using:\n\n```bash\npip install -e .\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n- **Check Version Compatibility**: Make sure the versions of `setuptools`, `pip`, and `your-build-backend` are compatible with PEP 660.\n- **Backend Support**: Verify that the backend specified in your `pyproject.toml` supports editable installs.\n- **Configuration Errors**: Ensure there are no typos or misconfigurations in your `pyproject.toml`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to install your project in editable mode even when specified via `pyproject.toml`. If issues persist, checking the documentation or the issue tracker for your build backend might provide additional insights."
