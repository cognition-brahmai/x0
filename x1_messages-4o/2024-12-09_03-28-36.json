I have installed tensorflow-gpu version on my pendrive and it works fine on both my PC (which has a GPU) and laptop (which doesn't have a GPU). If no GPU is found, tensorflow-gpu automatically uses the CPU version. Does the difference only lie in GPU support? If so, why is there a non-GPU version of tensorflow? Is it alright to proceed like this or should I create virtual environments to keep separate installations for the CPU and GPU? Also, isn't running tensorflow-gpu on a system with no GPU the same as setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1?"

        "content": "The main difference between the TensorFlow GPU and CPU versions lies in their ability to leverage the computational power of a GPU. Here's a more detailed explanation:\n\n1. **GPU Support**: The `tensorflow-gpu` package is compiled to utilize NVIDIA's CUDA and cuDNN libraries. This enables TensorFlow to offload computations to an NVIDIA GPU, which can significantly speed up the processing of deep learning models. The CPU version, on the other hand, does not include these capabilities and only runs computations on the CPU.\n\n2. **Automatic Fallback**: As you've observed, if the `tensorflow-gpu` version doesn't find a compatible GPU, it automatically falls back to using the CPU. This is why it works on both your PC (with GPU) and your laptop (without GPU).\n\n3. **Non-GPU Version**: The non-GPU version (`tensorflow`, formerly `tensorflow-cpu`) exists primarily for ease of use. It doesn't require the installation of CUDA and cuDNN, which can be complex and is unnecessary for systems that don't have an NVIDIA GPU. Additionally, it results in a smaller package size, which can be beneficial for environments with limited resources or storage.\n\n4. **Virtual Environments**: Using virtual environments to separate CPU and GPU installations isn't strictly necessary if you don't mind the extra dependencies installed by `tensorflow-gpu`. However, it can be beneficial for managing dependencies cleanly, especially if you have other projects that only require the CPU version and you want to avoid the overhead of GPU libraries.\n\n5. **CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES**: Setting `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1` effectively instructs TensorFlow to ignore the GPU, forcing it to run on the CPU. Running `tensorflow-gpu` on a system without a GPU is equivalent in practice to using this setting, as TensorFlow will default to CPU execution when no GPU is available.\n\nIn summary, it's perfectly fine to use `tensorflow-gpu` across all your machines if you prefer a single setup. The main considerations are whether you're comfortable with the additional installation steps for CUDA and cuDNN on systems with a GPU and whether you want to manage dependencies more granitely with virtual environments."
