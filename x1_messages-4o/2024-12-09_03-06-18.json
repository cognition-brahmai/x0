However, I also want to warn users that the old class name is deprecated and will be removed in the future. How can I elegantly mark the old class name as deprecated and warn users about its obsoleteness? I have tried making the old class name a function which emits a warning and constructs the new class object from its parameters using *args and **kvargs, but this did not work since the class has some class methods which cannot be called when the old class name is defined as a function. \n\nHere's the code I tried:\n```\nclass NewClsName(object):\n    @classmethod\n    def CreateVariant1( cls, ... ):\n        pass\n\n    @classmethod\n    def CreateVariant2( cls, ... ):\n        pass\n\ndef OldClsName(*args, **kwargs):\n    warnings.warn(\"The 'OldClsName' class was renamed [...]\",\n                  DeprecationWarning )\n    return NewClsName(*args, **kwargs)\n\nOldClsName.CreateVariant1( ... )\n```\nThis resulted in the following error: `AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'CreateVariant1'`\n\nIs there any better solution for this situation?"

        "content": "To maintain backward compatibility while warning users about the deprecated class name, you can create an alias for the old class name and issue a deprecation warning. However, instead of defining the old class name as a function, you can use a wrapper class that inherits from the new class. This way, you can call class methods on the old class name without issue.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport warnings\n\nclass NewClsName(object):\n    @classmethod\n    def CreateVariant1(cls, *args, **kwargs):\n        print(\"CreateVariant1 called with:\", args, kwargs)\n\n    @classmethod\n    def CreateVariant2(cls, *args, **kwargs):\n        print(\"CreateVariant2 called with:\", args, kwargs)\n\nclass OldClsName(NewClsName):\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        warnings.warn(\n            \"The 'OldClsName' class was renamed to 'NewClsName' and will be removed in a future release.\",\n            DeprecationWarning,\n            stacklevel=2\n        )\n        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n\n    @classmethod\n    def CreateVariant1(cls, *args, **kwargs):\n        warnings.warn(\n            \"The 'OldClsName' class was renamed to 'NewClsName' and will be removed in a future release.\",\n            DeprecationWarning,\n            stacklevel=2\n        )\n        super().CreateVariant1(*args, **kwargs)\n\n    @classmethod\n    def CreateVariant2(cls, *args, **kwargs):\n        warnings.warn(\n            \"The 'OldClsName' class was renamed to 'NewClsName' and will be removed in a future release.\",\n            DeprecationWarning,\n            stacklevel=2\n        )\n        super().CreateVariant2(*args, **kwargs)\n\n# Usage\nOldClsName.CreateVariant1('arg1', key='value')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Inheritance**: `OldClsName` inherits from `NewClsName`. This allows `OldClsName` to have access to all the methods and properties of `NewClsName`.\n\n2. **Warnings**: The `warnings.warn` function is used to emit a deprecation warning whenever `OldClsName` is instantiated or when its class methods are called. The `stacklevel=2` argument helps ensure the warning points to the user's code, not the library code.\n\n3. **Class Methods**: The class methods `CreateVariant1` and `CreateVariant2` are overridden in `OldClsName` to emit warnings and then call the corresponding method in the superclass (`NewClsName`).\n\nBy using this approach, you maintain full backward compatibility while effectively warning users that `OldClsName` is deprecated."
