        "content": "How can I copy a dictionary and modify it in one line of code in Python? I am often required to create dictionaries that differ from one another by an item or two. My current approach involves creating a deep copy of the original dictionary and then updating the required parameters. However, this leaves a point in my program where the new dictionary is an identical copy of the original one, which can lead to potential bugs if these two lines of code get separated. I would like to know how I can perform this action in a single line of code, preferably without using a semicolon to merge two commands into one physical line.\n\nHere is my current code:\n\n```python\nsetup1 = {'param1': val1, \n          'param2': val2,\n          'param2': val3,\n          'param4': val4,\n          'paramN': valN}\n\nsetup2 = copy.deepcopy(dict(setup1))\nsetup2.update({'param1': val10, \n               'param2': val20})\n```\n\nI would like to achieve something like this:\n\n```python\nsetup2 = dict(setup1).merge({'param1': val10, \n                             'param2': val20})\n```"

        "content": "You can achieve this in Python by using dictionary unpacking, which allows you to create a new dictionary by merging two dictionaries in a single line. This method doesn't require creating an intermediate copy and updating it separately. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nsetup2 = {**setup1, 'param1': val10, 'param2': val20}\n```\n\nIn this line of code, `{**setup1}` unpacks all the key-value pairs from `setup1` into the new dictionary `setup2`, and then the additional key-value pairs you specify (`'param1': val10` and `'param2': val20`) will update or add to this new dictionary. If a key already exists, the value will be overwritten with the new one.\n\nThis approach is concise and combines the copying and updating steps into one."
