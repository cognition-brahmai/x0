The code I am using is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\nts = pd.Series(np.random.randn(1000), index=pd.date_range('1/1/2000', periods=1000))\nts.plot()\n```\n\nBut the plot window does not appear when the script is run. Even when adding `time.sleep(5)`, there is still no output. Is there a way to make the plot window appear without having to manually call matplotlib?"

        "content": "When you're running a script outside of an interactive environment like IPython or Jupyter Notebook, you need to explicitly display the plot using `matplotlib`. By default, `pandas` uses `matplotlib` for plotting, but in a script, you must call `plt.show()` to render the plot window. Here's how you can modify your script to ensure the plot window appears:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Import matplotlib\n\n# Create a time series\nts = pd.Series(np.random.randn(1000), index=pd.date_range('1/1/2000', periods=1000))\n\n# Plot the series\nts.plot()\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nBy adding `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` and `plt.show()`, the plot window should appear when you run your script. This is necessary because while `pandas` handles plotting, `matplotlib` is responsible for creating the window to display the plot."
