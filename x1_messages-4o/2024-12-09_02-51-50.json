        "content": "I am working with a dataset of time series data that I use as input to an LSTM-RNN for action anticipation. The time series comprises a time of 5 seconds at 30 fps, meaning 150 data points, and the data represents the position/movement of facial features. I am creating additional sub-sequences of smaller length from my dataset to add redundancy and reduce overfitting. To train the LSTM model in batches, all time series need to have the same length. I am considering padding the sequences, but I am unsure where the padding should go. For example, I have the following original sequence:\n\n```\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n```\n\nAnd the subsequences are:\n\n```\n4 5 6 7\n8 9 10\n2 3 4 5 6\n```\n\nI am considering two options for padding:\n\nOption 1: Zeros go to substitute original values\n\n```\n0 0 0 4 5 6 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 9 10\n0 2 3 4 5 6 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nOption 2: all zeros at the end\n\n```\n4 5 6 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n8 9 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 3 4 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nAdditionally, some of the time series are missing a number of frames, and it is not known which ones they are. These also need to be padded before the subsequences are even taken. What is the best practice for padding in this case?"

        "content": "When dealing with LSTM models and time series data, padding is a common practice to ensure that all sequences have the same length. The choice of padding strategy can impact the performance of your model, and it's important to consider the characteristics of your data and the task at hand.\n\n### Padding Strategies:\n\n1. **Option 1: Zeros Substituting Original Values**\n   - This approach can be useful if you want to center the subsequences within the padded sequence. However, it can potentially disrupt the temporal dynamics of the sequence, which might be important for your LSTM model that relies on temporal order.\n\n2. **Option 2: All Zeros at the End**\n   - This method is generally preferred for time series data. Padding at the end preserves the temporal order of the sequence, which is crucial for LSTMs. The model can learn to ignore the padded values as they typically do not carry meaningful information, especially if you use masking.\n\n### Best Practices for Padding:\n\n- **Consistency**: Choose one padding strategy and stick with it throughout your dataset to maintain consistency.\n- **Masking**: Implement masking when constructing your model. This tells the LSTM to ignore certain parts of the input during training (i.e., the padded zeros), which helps in preventing any bias introduced by padding.\n- **Handling Missing Frames**: Before padding, you might want to consider interpolation or imputation techniques to handle missing frames if the missing data is not too extensive. This can help in maintaining the temporal coherence of your sequences.\n- **Padding Before Sub-sequencing**: If there are missing frames, pad the complete sequence first to a uniform length, then create subsequences. This way, you ensure that every subsequence is derived from uniformly sized sequences, preserving consistency across your dataset.\n\nIn summary, **Option 2** with padding zeros at the end is generally recommended for time series data when using LSTMs, as it maintains the temporal dynamics of the original sequence. Also, incorporating masking in your model will help in effectively handling the padded sequences during training."
