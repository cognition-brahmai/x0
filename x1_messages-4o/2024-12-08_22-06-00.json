        "content": "Other examples of habitats that support a large variety of species include:\n\n1. **Rainforests**: Known for their high biodiversity, rainforests provide a habitat for numerous species of plants, animals, insects, and microorganisms. The dense vegetation offers various niches and microhabitats, supporting a wide range of organisms.\n\n2. **Coral Reefs**: Often referred to as the \"rainforests of the sea,\" coral reefs support diverse marine life, including fish, mollusks, crustaceans, and corals. They provide food, shelter, and breeding grounds for many marine species.\n\n3. **Wetlands**: These areas, which include marshes and swamps, are rich in biodiversity. Wetlands support various bird species, amphibians, reptiles, and aquatic plants and serve as breeding grounds and feeding areas.\n\n4. **Savannas**: Characterized by grasslands with scattered trees, savannas support large herbivores like elephants and giraffes, as well as predators like lions and cheetahs. They are home to a variety of grasses, shrubs, and trees.\n\n5. **Estuaries**: Where freshwater meets the ocean, estuaries are nutrient-rich environments that support diverse species of fish, birds, and invertebrates. They act as nurseries for many marine species.\n\nWithin an ecosystem, different species depend on each other through various interactions, such as:\n\n- **Food Chains and Webs**: Producers (like plants) are consumed by herbivores, which are then preyed upon by carnivores. Decomposers break down dead organic matter, returning nutrients to the soil.\n\n- **Mutualism**: Some species engage in mutualistic relationships where both parties benefit. For example, bees pollinate flowers while collecting nectar.\n\n- **Predation and Herbivory**: Predators control the population of prey species, maintaining balance in the ecosystem. Herbivores, in turn, regulate plant populations.\n\n- **Competition**: Species compete for resources such as food, water, and space. This competition can drive evolutionary changes and adaptations.\n\n- **Symbiosis and Parasitism**: Some species live in close association with others, benefiting one or both. Parasitic relationships involve one organism benefiting at the expense of another.\n\nThese interactions create a complex web of interdependencies that contribute to the stability and resilience of ecosystems."
