        "content": "I'm trying to understand the memory usage by PyTorch DataLoader Workers. I am running a PyTorch training program with `num_workers=32` for `DataLoader`. When I check with `htop`, it displays 33 python processes each with 32GB of `VIRT` and 15GB of `RES`. I'm confused if this means that the PyTorch training is using 33 processes X 15 GB = 495 GB of memory. However, `htop` is only showing about 50 GB of RAM and 20 GB of swap is being used on the entire machine which has 128 GB of RAM. I'm not able to understand this discrepancy. Is there a more accurate way of calculating the total amount of RAM being used by the main PyTorch program and all its child DataLoader worker processes?"

        "content": "The discrepancy you're observing is due to the way memory usage is reported in tools like `htop`. Here's a breakdown of what's happening and how to interpret it:\n\n1. **VIRT (Virtual Memory)**: This represents the total address space that the process can access. It includes all types of memory the process can access, including memory that is swapped out, memory that is allocated but not used, and even memory that is mapped but not physically present in RAM. A high VIRT value doesn't necessarily mean that much physical memory is being used.\n\n2. **RES (Resident Memory)**: This is the actual physical memory being used by the process. It's a more accurate representation of the real memory usage but can be misleading if processes share memory.\n\n3. **Shared Memory**: PyTorch DataLoader workers might share memory for certain operations, especially if they are using shared resources or data is being loaded into shared memory. This can significantly reduce the total memory footprint. This shared memory usually means the RES value is over-reported when summed across processes.\n\n4. **Copy-on-Write**: When a new process is forked, it shares the memory with the parent process until it tries to modify it. This can again lead to over-reporting of memory usage when looking at RES.\n\nGiven these factors, the total memory usage might not be simply the sum of RES across all processes. The observed system memory usage (50 GB RAM and 20 GB swap) is a more accurate representation of what's being used overall.\n\n### More Accurate Ways to Measure Memory Usage:\n\n1. **Overall System Usage**: Check the total memory usage of the system using commands like `free -h` or `vmstat`. This gives a more holistic view of what's being used across the entire system.\n\n2. **Smem**: The `smem` tool can provide a more accurate breakdown of memory usage, including shared memory. It gives a clearer picture of unique memory usage per process.\n\n3. **PSS (Proportional Set Size)**: This is a measure that accounts for memory shared between processes. It provides a more accurate view of how much memory is actually being used by a process.\n\n4. **Inside PyTorch**: If you want to measure memory usage within PyTorch, you can use `torch.cuda.memory_allocated()` and `torch.cuda.memory_reserved()` to check GPU memory usage. For CPU memory, consider using Python's `tracemalloc` or `memory_profiler` packages.\n\nIn your case, the system's overall memory usage (50 GB RAM and 20 GB swap) suggests that the processes are sharing a significant amount of memory, and the actual unique memory usage is much less than the sum of RES values."
