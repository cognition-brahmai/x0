However, you want to avoid the common mistake of only considering the employee who works in the best-performing department. To make it a challenging puzzle, you cannot use any pre-existing formulas or functions. \nYou have data on each employee's individual performance and the success rate of their respective departments. To determine the top-performing employee, you need to come up with a logical and scalable method that considers both individual performance and department success rate. You can use the table below to organize the data. \nTo add more complexity to the puzzle, you need to make sure that the method you come up with is scalable and can be applied to a company with any number of employees and departments. Can you solve this puzzle and find the top-performing employee? \nHere's the table with the data you have:\n| Employee | Department | Individual Performance Score | Department Success Rate |\n| -------- | --------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |\n| John     | Sales     | 80                           | 75%                     |\n| Jane     | Marketing | 90                           | 90%                     |\n| Alex     | HR        | 85                           | 80%                     |\n| Tom      | IT        | 95                           | 95%                     |\n| Sarah    | Finance   | 75                           | 85%                     |\nGood luck!"

        "content": "To solve this puzzle and determine the top-performing employee, we need to devise a method that considers both the individual performance score and the department success rate. The method should balance these two factors to ensure that an employee's contribution is recognized both individually and within the context of their department's performance.\n\nHere is a scalable approach that can be applied to any number of employees and departments:\n\n### Scoring Method:\n\n1. **Normalize the Scores:**\n   Normalize both the individual performance scores and the department success rates to bring them onto a common scale. We can use a simple normalization technique where each score is divided by the maximum score in its category.\n\n2. **Calculate Weighted Scores:**\n   Assign weights to the normalized individual performance score and the normalized department success rate. Let's assume we give 60% weight to individual performance and 40% weight to department success rate, as individual performance might be considered slightly more important in this context.\n\n3. **Compute the Combined Score:**\n   For each employee, compute the combined score using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Combined Score} = (0.6 \\times \\text{Normalized Individual Performance}) + (0.4 \\times \\text{Normalized Department Success Rate})\n   \\]\n\n4. **Rank the Employees:**\n   Calculate the combined score for each employee and rank them based on this score. The employee with the highest combined score is the top performer.\n\n### Application to the Given Data:\n\n1. **Normalized Scores:**\n   - Max Individual Performance Score = 95\n   - Max Department Success Rate = 95%\n\n   | Employee | Normalized Individual Performance | Normalized Department Success Rate |\n   | -------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |\n   | John     | 80/95 \u2248 0.842                     | 75/95 \u2248 0.789                      |\n   | Jane     | 90/95 \u2248 0.947                     | 90/95 \u2248 0.947                      |\n   | Alex     | 85/95 \u2248 0.895                     | 80/95 \u2248 0.842                      |\n   | Tom      | 95/95 = 1.0                       | 95/95 = 1.0                        |\n   | Sarah    | 75/95 \u2248 0.789                     | 85/95 \u2248 0.895                      |\n\n2. **Combined Scores:**\n\n   | Employee | Combined Score                               |\n   | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n   | John     | (0.6 \\* 0.842) + (0.4 \\* 0.789) \u2248 0.819      |\n   | Jane     | (0.6 \\* 0.947) + (0.4 \\* 0.947) = 0.947      |\n   | Alex     | (0.6 \\* 0.895) + (0.4 \\* 0.842) \u2248 0.873      |\n   | Tom      | (0.6 \\* 1.0) + (0.4 \\* 1.0) = 1.0            |\n   | Sarah    | (0.6 \\* 0.789) + (0.4 \\* 0.895) \u2248 0.829      |\n\n3. **Ranking and Conclusion:**\n\n   Based on the combined scores, Tom is the top-performing employee with a score of 1.0. This method ensures a fair consideration of both individual and departmental contributions.\n\nThis approach can be applied to any dataset with similar metrics, making it scalable and adaptable to different organizational structures."
