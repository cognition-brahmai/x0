When I create a user in the Django admin, the password is displayed in plain text and it is also stored in the database as plaintext. I am currently trying to develop some views for authentication, but it's failing even when the username and password are correct. I suspect that the authenticate() function is hashing but returns None since the password stored in the database is not actually hashed. I'm using Python 3, Django 1.5, and PostgreSQL 5.0.3. What could be the possible reason why the password isn't getting hashed?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with the passwords being stored in plaintext is a significant security concern, and it indicates that the default password handling mechanism in Django isn't being utilized properly. Here are some potential reasons and solutions to address this problem:\n\n1. **Custom User Model Setup**:\n   - Ensure that your custom user model is correctly extending `AbstractUser` and not overriding the default password handling methods (`set_password`, `check_password`). These methods are responsible for hashing and verifying the password.\n\n2. **Saving Passwords**:\n   - When creating or updating users manually, make sure you are using the `set_password` method to set the password. This method will take care of hashing the password before it is saved to the database.\n   ```python\n   user = MyUserModel.objects.create(username='example')\n   user.set_password('your_password')\n   user.save()\n   ```\n\n3. **Django Admin Configuration**:\n   - If you are creating users through the Django admin interface, ensure that the user creation form is configured correctly to use the `set_password` method. This usually involves using Django's built-in user forms or ensuring your custom forms call `set_password`.\n\n4. **Overriding Save Method**:\n   - Check if you have overridden the `save` method in your custom user model and make sure you are not inadvertently saving the password without hashing it. If you need to override the save method, remember to hash the password using `set_password`.\n\n5. **Database Migration**:\n   - Ensure all database migrations have been applied correctly. Sometimes, issues can arise if there are pending migrations or if the database schema is not in sync with your models.\n\n6. **Django Version**:\n   - Django 1.5 is quite old and may not have the latest security features or support. Consider upgrading to a more recent version of Django, if possible, as it will have improved security mechanisms and support for modern Python versions.\n\n7. **Debugging Authentication**:\n   - For debugging the authentication issue, you might want to log the output of the `authenticate()` function to understand why it fails. Verify that the username and password are correct and that the authentication backend is configured properly in your settings.\n\nBy addressing these areas, you should be able to resolve the issue with passwords being stored in plaintext and ensure that authentication works correctly in your application."
