        "content": "In Python, threads themselves do not have a built-in way to return values directly to the parent thread. However, you can achieve this by using several techniques. One common approach is to use a `Queue` from the `queue` module, which is thread-safe, to collect the results from the threads. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport threading\nimport queue\n\ndef worker_function(q, *args):\n    # Perform some computation\n    result = sum(args)  # Example computation\n    # Put the result in the queue\n    q.put(result)\n\n# Create a queue to hold the return values\nresult_queue = queue.Queue()\n\n# Create and start a thread\nthread = threading.Thread(target=worker_function, args=(result_queue, 1, 2, 3))\nthread.start()\n\n# Wait for the thread to finish\nthread.join()\n\n# Retrieve the result from the queue\nresult = result_queue.get()\nprint(f\"Result: {result}\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `worker_function` calculates the sum of the arguments and puts the result into a `queue.Queue` object. The parent thread then retrieves the result from the queue after the worker thread has finished executing.\n\nAlternatively, if you are using Python 3.2 or newer, you can use the `concurrent.futures` module, which provides a higher-level interface for threading and processes. Here's how you can do it with `ThreadPoolExecutor`:\n\n```python\nfrom concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor\n\ndef worker_function(*args):\n    # Perform some computation\n    return sum(args)\n\n# Create a ThreadPoolExecutor\nwith ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1) as executor:\n    # Submit a task to the executor\n    future = executor.submit(worker_function, 1, 2, 3)\n    # Get the result\n    result = future.result()\n\nprint(f\"Result: {result}\")\n```\n\nUsing `ThreadPoolExecutor` simplifies the process, as it handles the threads and results for you. The `future.result()` method blocks until the function completes and returns the result."
