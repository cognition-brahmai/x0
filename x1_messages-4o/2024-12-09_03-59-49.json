I attempted to replicate the script given in a blog I found, and put the following code in a file named \"module.py\":\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\nsubprocess.call(\"ipython notebook --no-browser\", shell=True)\nsubprocess.call([r'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Mozilla Firefox\\Firefox.exe', '-new-tab', 'http://127.0.0.1:8888/'])\n```\n\nWhen I run it from the command line with `python C:\\Users\\mugabal\\Desktop\\module1.py`, it executes the first line but not the second one, even though both lines work fine individually. \n\nI also tried to launch IPython with the selected browser but was unsuccessful. When I run `ipython notebook --browser='C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Mozilla Firefox\\Firefox.exe'`, I get the error \"No web browser found: could not locate runnable browser.\" However, running `start firefox` in a Windows command prompt window works as expected, while `ipython notebook --browser=firefox` does not work, and gives the same error as previously mentioned. \n\nSo my question is, how can I launch a process and tell it not to hijack the console window?"

        "content": "To launch an IPython notebook with a non-default browser like Firefox on Windows 7, you can use a few different approaches to solve the problem you're facing. The issue seems to be related to how subprocess calls are made and how IPython's `--browser` option is interpreted. Here's a step-by-step solution that might help:\n\n### Method 1: Using `webbrowser` Module\n\nInstead of using the `subprocess` module to open the browser, you can use Python's built-in `webbrowser` module, which provides a higher-level interface to open URLs in browsers.\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\nimport webbrowser\nimport time\n\n# Launch IPython Notebook without opening a browser\nsubprocess.Popen(\"ipython notebook --no-browser\", shell=True)\n\n# Wait a bit for the server to start\ntime.sleep(2)\n\n# Open the notebook in Firefox\nfirefox_path = r'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Mozilla Firefox\\firefox.exe'\nwebbrowser.register('firefox', None, webbrowser.BackgroundBrowser(firefox_path))\nwebbrowser.get('firefox').open_new_tab('http://127.0.0.1:8888/')\n```\n\n### Method 2: Modify the IPython Config\n\nAnother way to specify a non-default browser is by modifying the IPython configuration file. This approach allows you to set Firefox as the default browser for IPython notebooks.\n\n1. Locate your IPython profile configuration file. You can generate it if it doesn't exist by running `ipython profile create`.\n\n2. Open the configuration file, which is typically located at `~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_notebook_config.py`.\n\n3. Add or modify the following line:\n\n   ```python\n   c.NotebookApp.browser = u'C:/Program Files (x86)/Mozilla Firefox/firefox.exe %s'\n   ```\n\n   Ensure you use the correct path to the Firefox executable and the `%s` placeholder for the URL.\n\n4. Save the changes and start the IPython notebook as usual with `ipython notebook`.\n\n### Method 3: Using `start` Command\n\nYou mentioned that `start firefox` works from the command prompt. You can use this approach in your script as well:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\n# Start the IPython Notebook without a browser\nsubprocess.Popen(\"ipython notebook --no-browser\", shell=True)\n\n# Wait a moment to ensure the server is running\ntime.sleep(2)\n\n# Use the start command to open Firefox\nsubprocess.Popen('start firefox http://127.0.0.1:8888/', shell=True)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **`subprocess.Popen`**: This allows the process to run independently of the script's console window, so it won't \"hijack\" it.\n- **`time.sleep(2)`**: This is used to give the IPython server time to start before attempting to open it in the browser.\n- **`webbrowser` Module**: This module is a better way to handle opening URLs in browsers, as it abstracts away some of the complexities.\n- **Configuration File**: Modifying the IPython configuration file is a persistent solution that will apply every time you start a notebook. \n\nBy following one of these methods, you should be able to launch an IPython notebook in Firefox without issues."
