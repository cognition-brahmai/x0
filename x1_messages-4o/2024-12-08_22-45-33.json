Here's a step-by-step guide to help you set this up:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Available Study Slots\n1. **List Your Obligations**: Start by filling in your daily obligations in the Excel table. This includes classes, work, meals, and any other commitments.\n2. **Identify Free Time**: Once your obligations are in place, identify the empty slots where you can potentially schedule your Math study sessions.\n\n### Step 2: Plan Your Study Sessions\n1. **Determine Study Duration**: Decide how long each study session should be. For instance, 1-hour blocks might be ideal.\n2. **Allocate Study Time**: Highlight or mark the slots in your Excel table where you plan to study Math. Ensure you have a balanced schedule across the week.\n\n### Step 3: Set Up Google Calendar\n1. **Create a New Calendar**:\n   - Open Google Calendar.\n   - Click on the gear icon and select **Settings**.\n   - In the left pane, click on **Add calendar** and select **Create new calendar**.\n   - Name it something like \"Math Study Schedule\".\n\n2. **Add Study Sessions**:\n   - Go back to the main calendar view.\n   - Click on the time slot where you want to add a study session.\n   - Enter the details of your study session (e.g., \"Math Study: Algebra\").\n   - Select the newly created calendar under **Calendar**.\n   - Set the study session to repeat weekly if you plan to keep the same schedule.\n\n3. **Set Reminders**:\n   - When creating or editing an event, you can add a reminder notification.\n   - You can choose to receive notifications via email or through a pop-up on your device.\n\n### Step 4: Share Your Calendar\n1. **Share with Study Partner**:\n   - In Google Calendar, go to your created calendar in the left pane.\n   - Click on the three dots next to it and select **Settings and sharing**.\n   - Under **Share with specific people**, add your study partner's email address.\n   - Choose the level of permissions (e.g., \"See all event details\" or \"Make changes to events\").\n\nBy following these steps, you'll have a well-organized schedule for your Math studies, integrated into Google Calendar, with reminders to keep you on track. Sharing the calendar with your study partner will also help both of you stay accountable and coordinate study sessions together."
