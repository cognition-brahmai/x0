        "content": "To construct a `thrust::device_vector<int>` from a pointer to an array, you'll need to first copy the data from the host to the device. Here's how you can do it using Thrust:\n\n```cpp\n#include <thrust/device_vector.h>\n#include <thrust/copy.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\nint* data;\nint num;\nget_data_from_library(&data, &num);\n\n// Allocate device memory\nint* d_data;\ncudaMalloc((void**)&d_data, num * sizeof(int));\n\n// Copy data from host to device\ncudaMemcpy(d_data, data, num * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);\n\n// Create a device_vector from the device memory\nthrust::device_vector<int> iVec(d_data, d_data + num);\n\n// Free the device memory if it's no longer needed\ncudaFree(d_data);\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Memory Allocation on Device:** Use `cudaMalloc` to allocate memory on the GPU for the data.\n\n2. **Copy Data to Device:** Use `cudaMemcpy` to transfer data from the host (CPU) to the device (GPU).\n\n3. **Construct `thrust::device_vector`:** `thrust::device_vector` can be initialized from a range of device pointers. Here, `d_data` is the start of the range and `d_data + num` is the end of the range.\n\n4. **Clean Up:** After constructing the `device_vector`, you can free the device memory using `cudaFree` if you don't need the raw device pointer anymore. However, in this case, you should ensure that `iVec` is not using `d_data` anymore after `cudaFree` is called. Since `thrust::device_vector` manages its own memory, the initial device memory can be freed once the data has been copied into the `device_vector`.\n\nThis code assumes that `get_data_from_library` fills `data` with a valid pointer to an array of integers and sets `num` to the number of elements in that array."
