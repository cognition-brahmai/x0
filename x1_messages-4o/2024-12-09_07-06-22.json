        "content": "Yes, in Django, you can achieve similar functionality to Rails' `rake routes` using the `show_urls` management command, which is available through third-party packages like `django-extensions`. This command will display all the URL patterns for your Django project, similar to how `rake routes` works in Ruby on Rails.\n\nHere's how you can set it up and use it:\n\n1. **Install django-extensions:**\n\n   First, you'll need to install the `django-extensions` package. You can do this using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install django-extensions\n   ```\n\n2. **Add to Installed Apps:**\n\n   After installing the package, add `django_extensions` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in your Django project's `settings.py` file:\n\n   ```python\n   INSTALLED_APPS = [\n       ...\n       'django_extensions',\n       ...\n   ]\n   ```\n\n3. **Run the show_urls Command:**\n\n   Once you have `django-extensions` installed and configured, you can use the `show_urls` management command to list all the URLs in your project:\n\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py show_urls\n   ```\n\nThis will display a list of all URL patterns, their names, and the corresponding view functions, similar to what you'd see with `rake routes` in Rails.\n\nIf you prefer not to use a third-party package, you can also create a custom management command in Django to print out the URL patterns. However, using `django-extensions` is a quick and convenient way to get started."
