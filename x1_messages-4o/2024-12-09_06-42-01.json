Is there an inbuilt way to do this in Python, similar to a `not(mylist)` function, without having to write a loop to reverse the elements manually?"

However, you can achieve this in a concise way using list comprehensions, which are both efficient and easy to read. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nmylist = [True, True, False, True]\nflipped_list = [not element for element in mylist]\nprint(flipped_list)  # Output: [False, False, True, False]\n```\n\nThis code uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in `mylist`, applies the `not` operator to flip its boolean value, and constructs a new list with the flipped values. This method is both Pythonic and efficient for this purpose."
