        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the incorrect installation or import of the BeautifulSoup module. The `ImportError: No module named BeautifulSoup` typically means that Python cannot find the module you're trying to import. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check the Python Version**: Ensure that you are using the correct version of Python that you installed BeautifulSoup for. The script you provided uses Python 2.7, and BeautifulSoup has different versions for Python 2 and Python 3.\n\n2. **Use the Correct Package Name**: The modern version of BeautifulSoup is `beautifulsoup4`, and it should be installed and imported differently:\n   - Install with `pip` (which is the recommended package installer):\n     ```bash\n     pip install beautifulsoup4\n     ```\n   - Import it in your script:\n     ```python\n     from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n     ```\n\n3. **Verify Installation**: Ensure that `beautifulsoup4` is installed in the Python environment you are using. You can check by running:\n   ```bash\n   pip list\n   ```\n   or\n   ```bash\n   pip freeze\n   ```\n   and look for `beautifulsoup4` in the list.\n\n4. **Use Virtual Environment**: If you have different Python environments, make sure you are installing and running your script in the same environment. You can use virtual environments to manage dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\\Scripts\\activate`\n   pip install beautifulsoup4\n   ```\n\n5. **Legacy Version**: If you specifically need to use the older `BeautifulSoup` module (version 3), ensure you installed it correctly using:\n   ```bash\n   pip install BeautifulSoup\n   ```\n   However, it's highly recommended to move to `beautifulsoup4` as it is actively maintained and more powerful.\n\nOnce you have ensured the correct installation and import, the script should run without the import error. Here's the updated script with `beautifulsoup4`:\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport re\n\ndoc = ['<html><head><title>Page title</title></head>',\n       '<body><p id=\"firstpara\" align=\"center\">This is paragraph <b>one</b>.',\n       '<p id=\"secondpara\" align=\"blah\">This is paragraph <b>two</b>.',\n       '</html>']\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(''.join(doc), 'html.parser')\n\nprint(soup.prettify())\n```\n\nThis should resolve your issue."
