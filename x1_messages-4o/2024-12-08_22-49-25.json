The first two digits of that year are 19.\n\nMount Everest, the highest peak in the world, has an altitude of 8,848 meters. The sum of its digits is 8 + 8 + 4 + 8 = 28.\n\nNow, multiply the first two digits of the year by the sum of the digits of the altitude:\n19 * 28 = 532\n\nMount Everest is located in Nepal. The number of letters in \"Nepal\" is 5.\n\nSubtract the number of letters in the name of the country from the product:\n532 - 5 = 527\n\nTherefore, the final number is 527."
