Is there any straightforward method to preserve the key as an integer without the need to parse the string on dump and load? Here's the code I've been working with:\n\n```python\nimport json\nreleases = {1: \"foo-v0.1\"}\njson.dumps(releases)\n```\n\nThis code gives me the output '{\"1\": \"foo-v0.1\"}'. I suspect it might be possible using the hooks provided by the json module, but that still requires parsing. Is there an argument I may have missed? \n\nAdditionally, considering that json works as I feared, is there an easy way to convey key type by possibly parsing the output of dumps? The code that does the dumping and the code that downloads the json object from a server and loads it are both written by me."

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is due to the JSON specification itself. In JSON, object keys are always strings. Therefore, when you serialize a Python dictionary with integer keys using the `json.dumps()` method, the keys are automatically converted to strings.\n\nUnfortunately, there's no direct argument in the `json` module to preserve the integer keys during serialization. However, you can implement a workaround by encoding and decoding the keys manually. Here are a couple of approaches you might consider:\n\n### Approach 1: Custom Encoding and Decoding\n\nYou can write custom functions to convert the keys to strings with a prefix or suffix before serialization and then reverse this process after deserialization.\n\n#### Example:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef encode_keys(d):\n    return {str(k): v for k, v in d.items()}\n\ndef decode_keys(d):\n    return {int(k): v for k, v in d.items()}\n\n# Original data\nreleases = {1: \"foo-v0.1\"}\n\n# Encode and serialize\nencoded_releases = encode_keys(releases)\njson_data = json.dumps(encoded_releases)\n\n# Deserialize and decode\nloaded_data = json.loads(json_data)\ndecoded_releases = decode_keys(loaded_data)\n\nprint(decoded_releases)  # Output: {1: 'foo-v0.1'}\n```\n\n### Approach 2: Using JSON Hooks\n\nYou can use the `object_hook` parameter with `json.loads` to convert keys back to integers after loading.\n\n#### Example:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef decode_keys(d):\n    return {int(k): v for k, v in d.items()}\n\n# Original data\nreleases = {1: \"foo-v0.1\"}\n\n# Serialize\njson_data = json.dumps(releases)\n\n# Deserialize with object_hook\ndecoded_releases = json.loads(json_data, object_hook=decode_keys)\n\nprint(decoded_releases)  # Output: {1: 'foo-v0.1'}\n```\n\nBoth approaches require some form of manual processing, but they will allow you to work around the limitation imposed by the JSON format. If you control both the serialization and deserialization, implementing these functions should be straightforward."
