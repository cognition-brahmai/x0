        "content": "To write a Python program that calculates the square root of a given number, you can make use of the `math` module, which provides a convenient function `sqrt` specifically for this purpose. Below is a simple program that takes a number as input from the user and calculates its square root:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_square_root():\n    try:\n        # Get user input\n        number = float(input(\"Enter a number to find its square root: \"))\n\n        # Check if the number is non-negative\n        if number < 0:\n            print(\"Cannot calculate the square root of a negative number.\")\n        else:\n            # Calculate the square root\n            square_root = math.sqrt(number)\n\n            # Display the result\n            print(f\"The square root of {number} is {square_root}\")\n\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Please enter a valid number.\")\n\n# Call the function\ncalculate_square_root()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Importing the `math` module**: This module contains the `sqrt` function, which is used to calculate the square root.\n\n2. **Getting user input**: The program uses `input()` to get a number from the user. `float()` is used to convert the input to a floating-point number, which allows for decimal input.\n\n3. **Handling negative input**: The program checks if the input number is negative. Since the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real number system, the program informs the user of this.\n\n4. **Calculating the square root**: If the number is non-negative, the program calculates the square root using `math.sqrt()`.\n\n5. **Handling invalid input**: The program uses a `try-except` block to handle cases where the user input cannot be converted to a float, such as if the user enters a non-numeric value.\n\nThis program provides a user-friendly way to calculate the square root of a number while handling potential errors gracefully."
