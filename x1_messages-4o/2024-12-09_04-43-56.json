This allows you to run a script and then drop into the IPython shell with the environment set up by that script. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. Create your script, for example, `myscript.py`, with the functions and any other initialization code you want.\n\n2. Start IPython with the script by using the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   ipython -i myscript.py\n   ```\n\nThis command will execute `myscript.py` and then provide you with an interactive IPython shell where you can use the functions and variables defined in the script.\n\nThis method is particularly useful for setting up your environment with predefined functions, classes, or data before starting your interactive session."
