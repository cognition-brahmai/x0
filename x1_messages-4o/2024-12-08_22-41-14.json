        "content": "To retrieve a detailed list of hotels in Chicago with specific attributes like ratings, prices, amenities, and promotions, you would typically use a database or an API, as Excel alone cannot fetch real-time data from the web. However, if the data is already in an Excel table, you can filter it using the `FILTER` function, as you mentioned.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how you might set this up in Excel assuming you have a data table:\n\n1. **Prepare Your Data**: Ensure your data is organized in a table format, with a header row. Let's assume your table is named `HotelsData` and has the following columns: `Hotel Name`, `City`, `Rating`, `Price`, `Amenities`, `Promotions/Deals`.\n\n2. **Use the FILTER Formula**: You can use the `FILTER` function to extract only the rows where the city is Chicago.\n\n   Here's an example formula:\n\n   ```excel\n   =FILTER(HotelsData, HotelsData[City]=\"Chicago\", \"No data available\")\n   ```\n\n   This formula will return all columns for hotels located in Chicago. If you want to specify which columns to return, you would need to adjust the formula or use additional functions to extract specific columns.\n\n3. **Extract Specific Columns**: If you only want certain columns, you might use the `INDEX` and `MATCH` functions in combination with `FILTER`. However, Excel doesn't directly support extracting non-contiguous columns with `FILTER`, so you may need to rearrange your data or use helper columns.\n\n4. **Alternative Approach**: If you want to pull real-time data from a web source, consider using Power Query to connect to an online data source or API that provides hotel information. This requires some setup and possibly a web API key, depending on the source.\n\nRemember, the `FILTER` function is available in Excel 365 and Excel 2019. If you're using an older version of Excel, you might need to use other methods like pivot tables or manual filtering."
