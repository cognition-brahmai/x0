I am trying to pick the best parameter set for a model and I am unsure whether to use `n_jobs = -1` or `n_jobs` with a large number such as `n_jobs = 30`. According to the sklearn documentation, `n_jobs = -1` means that the computation will be dispatched on all the CPUs of the computer. I am running this on a PC with an Intel i3 CPU, which has 2 cores and 4 threads. So, does that mean if I set `n_jobs = -1`, implicitly it will be equal to `n_jobs = 2`?"

        "content": "When using `GridSearchCV` in scikit-learn, setting `n_jobs = -1` indeed means that all available CPU cores will be utilized for parallel processing. In your case, with an Intel i3 CPU that has 2 cores and 4 threads, setting `n_jobs = -1` would utilize all 4 logical processors (threads). This can be beneficial as it maximizes the use of available resources, allowing for potentially faster computation times.\n\nHere are a few considerations to help you determine the optimum number of processes (`n_jobs`) to use:\n\n1. **Resource Utilization**: Setting `n_jobs = -1` is generally a good starting point to ensure all available resources are utilized. However, if you notice your system becoming unresponsive or other applications slowing down, you might want to reduce the number of jobs.\n\n2. **System Load**: Monitor your CPU usage using system tools (e.g., Task Manager on Windows, htop on Linux) while running the grid search. If the CPU usage is consistently at 100% and affecting other tasks, consider lowering `n_jobs`.\n\n3. **Overhead**: Keep in mind that there is some overhead associated with creating and managing threads or processes. Sometimes, using fewer threads than the maximum available can lead to better performance due to reduced overhead.\n\n4. **Experimentation**: Try running your grid search with different values of `n_jobs` (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4) and measure the time taken for each configuration. This will give you empirical evidence of the optimal setting for your specific case.\n\n5. **Hyperthreading Considerations**: Although hyperthreading allows each core to handle two threads, the performance gain isn't always linear. Sometimes, using fewer than the total number of logical processors can be more efficient.\n\nIn summary, while `n_jobs = -1` is a good default choice, you may need to experiment with different values, especially in environments with limited computational resources, to find the optimal balance between performance and system responsiveness."
