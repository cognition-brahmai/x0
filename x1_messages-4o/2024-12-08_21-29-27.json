Apart from allowing the users to track their expenses and income, set budgets, and view reports, you need to make the app even more functional by enabling it to support recurring transactions and custom categories for expenses. Please provide the code implementation in [Java code] data type for these two new features. Moreover, could you also suggest the most efficient and effective way to test the functionality of these newly added features?"

        "content": "To enhance your mobile budgeting app with the support for recurring transactions and custom categories, we will extend the existing functionality by implementing these features in Java. Here's a conceptual implementation for each feature:\n\n### 1. Recurring Transactions\n\nWe need to define a `RecurringTransaction` class to handle recurring transactions.\n\n```java\nimport java.time.LocalDate;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\nenum Frequency {\n    DAILY,\n    WEEKLY,\n    MONTHLY,\n    YEARLY\n}\n\nclass RecurringTransaction {\n    private String name;\n    private double amount;\n    private Frequency frequency;\n    private LocalDate startDate;\n    private LocalDate endDate;\n\n    public RecurringTransaction(String name, double amount, Frequency frequency, LocalDate startDate, LocalDate endDate) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.amount = amount;\n        this.frequency = frequency;\n        this.startDate = startDate;\n        this.endDate = endDate;\n    }\n\n    public List<LocalDate> getTransactionDates() {\n        List<LocalDate> dates = new ArrayList<>();\n        LocalDate date = startDate;\n        \n        while (!date.isAfter(endDate)) {\n            dates.add(date);\n            switch (frequency) {\n                case DAILY:\n                    date = date.plusDays(1);\n                    break;\n                case WEEKLY:\n                    date = date.plusWeeks(1);\n                    break;\n                case MONTHLY:\n                    date = date.plusMonths(1);\n                    break;\n                case YEARLY:\n                    date = date.plusYears(1);\n                    break;\n            }\n        }\n        \n        return dates;\n    }\n    \n    // Add getters and setters\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Custom Categories for Expenses\n\nWe need to implement a way to create and manage custom categories.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\n\nclass CategoryManager {\n    private Map<String, Double> categories = new HashMap<>();\n\n    public void addCategory(String categoryName) {\n        if (!categories.containsKey(categoryName)) {\n            categories.put(categoryName, 0.0);\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Category already exists.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void recordExpense(String categoryName, double amount) {\n        if (categories.containsKey(categoryName)) {\n            categories.put(categoryName, categories.get(categoryName) + amount);\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Category does not exist.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public double getTotalExpense(String categoryName) {\n        return categories.getOrDefault(categoryName, 0.0);\n    }\n\n    // Add other methods as needed\n}\n```\n\n### Efficient Testing Methodology\n\nTesting these features can be done through a combination of unit tests and integration tests. Here\u2019s a suggested approach:\n\n1. **Unit Testing**:\n   - Use a testing framework like JUnit to write unit tests for each method.\n   - Write tests to cover various scenarios, such as adding a new category, recording an expense, and calculating total expenses.\n   - Test the `RecurringTransaction` class for different frequencies and date ranges.\n\n   Example JUnit test for `RecurringTransaction`:\n\n   ```java\n   import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\n   import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;\n\n   import java.time.LocalDate;\n   import java.util.List;\n\n   class RecurringTransactionTest {\n\n       @Test\n       void testGetTransactionDates() {\n           RecurringTransaction transaction = new RecurringTransaction(\"Gym Membership\", 50.0, Frequency.MONTHLY,\n                   LocalDate.of(2023, 1, 1), LocalDate.of(2023, 12, 31));\n           List<LocalDate> dates = transaction.getTransactionDates();\n           assertEquals(12, dates.size());\n           assertEquals(LocalDate.of(2023, 1, 1), dates.get(0));\n           assertEquals(LocalDate.of(2023, 12, 1), dates.get(11));\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Integration Testing**:\n   - Simulate user interactions to ensure that the features work seamlessly within the app.\n   - Use tools like Espresso for Android to automate UI testing.\n   - Test scenarios where a user adds multiple categories, records expenses, and sets up recurring transactions.\n\n3. **User Acceptance Testing**:\n   - Conduct testing sessions with real users to gather feedback on the new features.\n   - Observe how users interact with the app and identify any usability issues.\n\nBy combining these testing methodologies, you can ensure that the new features are robust, functional, and user-friendly."
