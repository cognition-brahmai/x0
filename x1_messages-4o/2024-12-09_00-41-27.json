I want to execute a function for a list of entries without leaving a footprint in the global namespace. Here's an example of what I'm currently using:\n\n```python\nfor x in wowList:\n   installWow(x, 'installed by me')\n```\n\nOne solution I've considered is using map with lambda:\n\n```python\nmap(lambda x: installWow(x, 'installed by me'), wowList)\n```\n\nHowever, this creates a list of [None, None, ...] which I don't need. Is there a similar function that doesn't have a return list?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this by using the `map` function in combination with `list` or `for` loops to execute the function on each item without storing the results. However, since `map` in Python 3 returns an iterator instead of a list, it doesn't directly generate a list of `[None, None, ...]` like it would in Python 2. \n\nYou can simply use a `for` loop to iterate over the mapped result without creating an unnecessary list:\n\n```python\nfor _ in map(lambda x: installWow(x, 'installed by me'), wowList):\n    pass\n```\n\nAlternatively, using a list comprehension with a `for` loop might be clearer to read and understand:\n\n```python\n[installWow(x, 'installed by me') for x in wowList]\n```\n\nBoth of these methods will apply `installWow` to each item in `wowList` without leaving a list of `None` values. However, the list comprehension technically creates a list object containing `None` values, but it's not stored or used. The `for` loop with `map` only iterates over the actions without storing any output, making it memory-efficient for very large lists."
