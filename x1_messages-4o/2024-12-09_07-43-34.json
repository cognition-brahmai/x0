This means that, for logical operators like `or` and `and`, Python stops evaluating as soon as the result is determined.\n\nIn your example:\n\n```python\nif (foo1 or foo2):\n    ...\n    ...\n```\n\nIf `foo1` evaluates to `True`, Python will not evaluate `foo2` because the result of the `or` operation is already determined to be `True`. This is known as \"short-circuiting.\" The same principle applies to the `and` operator, where evaluation stops if a `False` is encountered, making the whole expression `False`.\n\nThis behavior can be useful for optimizing performance or avoiding unnecessary computations. It can also be used to prevent errors, such as avoiding a function call that might raise an exception if not needed."
