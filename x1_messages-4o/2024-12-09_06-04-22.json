The original code is:\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\n\ndef worker():\n    \"\"\"worker function\"\"\"\n    print 'Worker'\n    return\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    jobs = []\n    for i in range(5):\n        p = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker)\n        jobs.append(p)\n        p.start()\n```\n\nHowever, when I remove the `if __name__ == '__main__':` condition and run the code like this:\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\n\ndef worker():\n    \"\"\"worker function\"\"\"\n    print 'Worker'\n    return\n\njobs = []\nfor i in range(5):\n    p = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker)\n    jobs.append(p)\n    p.start()\n```\n\nIt starts spawning processes continuously until I force a system reboot. Why is this happening? Why isn't it generating just 5 processes and then exiting? Why do I need the if statement?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to the way Python's multiprocessing module works in conjunction with the Python interpreter's behavior when it imports modules. \n\nWhen you remove the `if __name__ == '__main__':` guard, you're allowing the multiprocessing code to execute at import time, which leads to a recursive creation of processes. Here's a breakdown of why this happens:\n\n1. **Without the Guard**: When you run the script without the `if __name__ == '__main__':` guard, the entire script is executed when it is imported as a module in a new process created by `multiprocessing.Process()`. This means that when a new process is spawned, it imports the script again, which leads to the creation of more processes, and the cycle repeats indefinitely.\n\n2. **With the Guard**: The `if __name__ == '__main__':` guard ensures that the code block is only executed when the script is run directly, not when it is imported as a module in a new process. This is because in Python, the `__name__` variable is set to `\"__main__\"` only in the script that is run directly, and not in imported modules. Hence, the process creation code is only executed once in the main process, preventing a recursive loop of process creation.\n\nTo fix the issue, you need to put the process creation code inside the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block. This ensures that it only runs once, in the main process, and does not execute again in the child processes created by `multiprocessing`.\n\nHere\u2019s the correct way to structure the script:\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\n\ndef worker():\n    \"\"\"worker function\"\"\"\n    print('Worker')\n    return\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    jobs = []\n    for i in range(5):\n        p = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker)\n        jobs.append(p)\n        p.start()\n```\n\nMake sure also to change the `print 'Worker'` to `print('Worker')`, as the former syntax is for Python 2.x."
