Assuming there is a column named `popularity` in your `songs` table to determine the popularity of the songs, you can use the following SQL query to list the top 5 songs released in the year 2005 along with the artist name and album name:\n\n```sql\nSELECT name, artist, album\nFROM songs\nWHERE release_year = 2005\nORDER BY popularity DESC\nLIMIT 5;\n```\n\nThis query selects the `name`, `artist`, and `album` columns from the `songs` table where the `release_year` is 2005. It orders the results by `popularity` in descending order and limits the output to the top 5 entries. If the `popularity` column doesn't exist, you'll need to adjust the query to include whatever metric you use to determine a song's popularity."
