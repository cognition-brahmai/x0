Currently, when I click on a section, it only shows the subsections under that specific section and hides the contents of other sections. I would like all sections to be expanded every time I'm on the index page. For instance, I want to change the current format:\n\n```\nSection 1\nSection 2\nSection 3\n```\nto this format:\n\n```\nSection 1\n  Subsection 1.1\n  Subsection 1.2\n  Subsection 1.3\nSection 2\n  Subsection 2.1\n  Subsection 2.2\n  Subsection 2.3\nSection 3\n  Subsection 3.1\n  Subsection 3.2\n  Subsection 3.3\n```\nI've tried adding `toctree` and `maxdepth` but it doesn't seem to work. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To expand all the subsections under the headers in your Sphinx documentation, you can adjust your `index.rst` file to ensure that all sections and subsections are fully expanded. Here are some steps to achieve that:\n\n1. **Use `toctree` with `maxdepth`**: Ensure that you have a `toctree` directive in your `index.rst` file with an appropriate `maxdepth` value. The `maxdepth` option determines how many levels of headings are included. Set it to a sufficiently high value to include all subsections.\n\n    ```rst\n    .. toctree::\n       :maxdepth: 2\n       :caption: Contents\n\n       section1\n       section2\n       section3\n    ```\n\n2. **Ensure Subsections are Defined**: Make sure that each section file (e.g., `section1.rst`, `section2.rst`, etc.) has its subsections defined using appropriate heading levels. For example:\n\n    ```rst\n    Section 1\n    =========\n\n    Subsection 1.1\n    --------------\n\n    Content of subsection 1.1\n\n    Subsection 1.2\n    --------------\n\n    Content of subsection 1.2\n\n    Subsection 1.3\n    --------------\n\n    Content of subsection 1.3\n    ```\n\n3. **Check Sphinx Theme Settings**: Some Sphinx themes might have settings that collapse sections by default. If you're using a specific theme, check its documentation for any options related to expanding/collapsing sections. For example, in the `conf.py` file, you might need to set:\n\n    ```python\n    html_theme_options = {\n        'collapse_navigation': False,\n        # Other theme-specific options\n    }\n    ```\n\n4. **Auto-TOC Generation**: If you haven't already, ensure that your `conf.py` file has the necessary extensions enabled. For example, the `sphinx.ext.autosectionlabel` extension can help manage section references.\n\n5. **Rebuild the Documentation**: After making changes, rebuild your Sphinx documentation to see the updates. You can usually do this by running:\n\n    ```bash\n    make html\n    ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to configure your Sphinx documentation to display all sections and their subsections expanded on the index page. If issues persist, consider checking the theme or additional Sphinx extensions you might be using for any settings that could override this behavior."
