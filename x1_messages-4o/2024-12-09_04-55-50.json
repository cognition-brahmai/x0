Open the file in read mode.\n2. Loop through each line of the file.\n3. Check if the key-phrase or keyword is in the current line.\n4. If the key-phrase or keyword is found, print the line.\n\nHere is a simple Python script to accomplish this:\n\n```python\ndef search_file(file_path, keyword):\n    try:\n        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:\n            for line_number, line in enumerate(file, start=1):\n                if keyword in line:\n                    print(f\"Line {line_number}: {line.strip()}\")\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"The file {file_path} does not exist.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n# Example usage:\nfile_path = 'example.txt'  # Replace with your file path\nkeyword = 'your_keyword'   # Replace with the key-phrase or keyword you are searching for\nsearch_file(file_path, keyword)\n```\n\nReplace `'example.txt'` with the path to your text file and `'your_keyword'` with the key-phrase or keyword you want to search for.\n\nThis script reads the file line by line, checks if the keyword is present in each line, and prints the line number and content if the keyword is found."
