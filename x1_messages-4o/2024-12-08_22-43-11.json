The table should have columns for ID (set as a primary key and auto-incrementing), name (a VARCHAR of up to 255 characters), ingredients (a TEXT field), and instructions (also a TEXT field).\nOnce your table is set up, insert the following information for your fruit pizza: name it \"Fruit Pizza\", and include the following ingredients - pizza dough, olive oil, minced garlic, crumbled goat cheese, prosciutto, grilled peaches or figs, and fresh arugula. \nTo bake the pizza, preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit, roll out the dough on a floured surface, brush it with olive oil and garlic, then top with goat cheese, prosciutto, and your grilled fruit. Bake for 10-12 minutes until golden brown, then add the arugula on top before serving.\nNow, to retrieve your delicious recipe, use a SELECT statement with the following syntax: SELECT name, ingredients, instructions FROM pizza_recipe WHERE name='Fruit Pizza'. This will give you a result with the name of your pizza, its list of ingredients, and step-by-step instructions to create it. Can you handle the challenge?"

        "content": "Sure, I can guide you through this challenge. Below are the SQL commands to create the database, table, insert the data, and retrieve it:\n\n1. **Create the Database:**\n\n   ```sql\n   CREATE DATABASE pizza_db;\n   ```\n\n2. **Use the Database:**\n\n   ```sql\n   USE pizza_db;\n   ```\n\n3. **Create the Table:**\n\n   ```sql\n   CREATE TABLE pizza_recipe (\n       ID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n       name VARCHAR(255),\n       ingredients TEXT,\n       instructions TEXT\n   );\n   ```\n\n4. **Insert the Fruit Pizza Recipe:**\n\n   ```sql\n   INSERT INTO pizza_recipe (name, ingredients, instructions) VALUES (\n       'Fruit Pizza',\n       'pizza dough, olive oil, minced garlic, crumbled goat cheese, prosciutto, grilled peaches or figs, fresh arugula',\n       'Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Roll out the dough on a floured surface, brush it with olive oil and garlic, then top with goat cheese, prosciutto, and your grilled fruit. Bake for 10-12 minutes until golden brown, then add the arugula on top before serving.'\n   );\n   ```\n\n5. **Retrieve the Recipe:**\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT name, ingredients, instructions FROM pizza_recipe WHERE name='Fruit Pizza';\n   ```\n\nThese SQL commands will set up your `pizza_db` database, create the `pizza_recipe` table, insert the specified fruit pizza recipe, and provide a way to retrieve it with a `SELECT` statement. Enjoy your fruit-based pizza creation!"
