        "content": "Welcome to the ultimate JSON extraction challenge! Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to extract specific data from a JSON file named \"data.json\" using Python. However, in addition to the four code snippets provided, you must also ensure that your solution uses a custom-built Python package that you have created. Your package should have the ability to handle JSON files with nested structures and provide a comprehensive error handling mechanism for cases where the desired data cannot be extracted. To complete this challenge, you must select the code snippet that correctly utilizes your custom package to extract the desired data from the JSON file. But be warned, the incorrect options contain sneaky errors and will not utilize your custom package effectively, potentially leading to incorrect results. Are you ready to put your advanced Python skills to the test and show off your package-building expertise? The clock is ticking, good luck!"

        "content": "Certainly! Let's break down the task and approach it step by step:\n\n1. **Create a Custom Python Package**: This package will handle the JSON extraction and should include robust error handling. Let's name this package `json_extractor`.\n\n2. **Structure of the Package**:\n   - `json_extractor/`\n     - `__init__.py`: This will make the directory a package.\n     - `extractor.py`: This module will contain the core functionality for extracting data.\n     - `exceptions.py`: This module will define custom exceptions for error handling.\n\n3. **Functionality of the Package**:\n   - **Handle Nested Structures**: The package should be able to traverse and extract data from nested JSON objects.\n   - **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle scenarios where data is not found or is inaccessible.\n\n4. **Example Code Snippet Using the Package**: This snippet will demonstrate how to utilize the package effectively.\n\n### Package Implementation\n\n**1. `extractor.py`:**\n\n```python\nimport json\n\nclass JsonExtractor:\n    def __init__(self, file_path):\n        self.file_path = file_path\n        self.data = self.load_json()\n\n    def load_json(self):\n        try:\n            with open(self.file_path, 'r') as file:\n                return json.load(file)\n        except FileNotFoundError:\n            raise FileNotFoundError(f\"The file {self.file_path} was not found.\")\n        except json.JSONDecodeError:\n            raise ValueError(\"The file is not a valid JSON file.\")\n\n    def get_value(self, keys):\n        try:\n            value = self.data\n            for key in keys:\n                value = value[key]\n            return value\n        except KeyError:\n            raise KeyError(f\"Key path {'->'.join(keys)} not found in the JSON.\")\n        except TypeError:\n            raise TypeError(\"The provided key path leads to a non-dict element.\")\n\n```\n\n**2. `exceptions.py`:**\n\n```python\nclass JsonExtractorError(Exception):\n    \"\"\"Base class for other exceptions\"\"\"\n    pass\n\nclass FileNotFoundError(JsonExtractorError):\n    pass\n\nclass KeyNotFoundError(JsonExtractorError):\n    pass\n\nclass InvalidJsonError(JsonExtractorError):\n    pass\n```\n\n**3. `__init__.py`:**\n\n```python\nfrom .extractor import JsonExtractor\nfrom .exceptions import JsonExtractorError, FileNotFoundError, KeyNotFoundError, InvalidJsonError\n```\n\n### Code Snippet Using the Package\n\n```python\nfrom json_extractor import JsonExtractor\n\ndef main():\n    file_path = 'data.json'\n    keys = ['key1', 'nestedKey', 'targetKey']  # Example key path\n\n    try:\n        extractor = JsonExtractor(file_path)\n        value = extractor.get_value(keys)\n        print(f\"Extracted value: {value}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **JsonExtractor Class**: Handles loading the JSON file and extracting nested values.\n- **Error Handling**: Custom exceptions for file not found, invalid JSON, and key errors.\n- **Usage**: The `main()` function demonstrates how to use the `JsonExtractor` to extract data.\n\nThis setup ensures that you have a modular package to handle JSON data extraction with robust error handling. You can extend this package further by adding more features or customizations as needed.\n\nFeel free to ask if you need more details or further customization!"
