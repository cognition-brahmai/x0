The API documentation specifies that the User ID and password need to be concatenated and then Base64 encoded, with the format being 'userid:password'. This encoded value then needs to be provided in an \"Authorization Header\" following the format 'Authorization: BASIC {Base64-encoded value}'. How can I incorporate this into a Python API request? Here is my current post request:\n\n```python\nz = requests.post(url, data=zdata)\n```"

Concatenate your `User ID` and `password` in the format 'userid:password'.\n2. Encode the concatenated string using Base64.\n3. Include the encoded string in the \"Authorization\" header in the format 'Authorization: Basic {Base64-encoded value}'.\n\nHere is how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport base64\n\n# Your User ID and password\nuser_id = 'your_user_id'\npassword = 'your_password'\n\n# Concatenate User ID and password\ncredentials = f'{user_id}:{password}'\n\n# Encode the credentials using Base64\nencoded_credentials = base64.b64encode(credentials.encode('utf-8')).decode('utf-8')\n\n# Set up the headers with the Base64-encoded credentials\nheaders = {\n    'Authorization': f'Basic {encoded_credentials}'\n}\n\n# Your data for the POST request\nzdata = {\n    # Your data here\n}\n\n# URL for the POST request\nurl = 'https://api.example.com/endpoint'\n\n# Make the POST request with headers\nresponse = requests.post(url, data=zdata, headers=headers)\n\n# Check the response\nprint(response.status_code)\nprint(response.text)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- The `base64.b64encode()` function encodes the credentials to Base64.\n- The `decode('utf-8')` is used to convert the Base64 bytes back into a string.\n- The `headers` dictionary includes the 'Authorization' entry with the encoded credentials.\n- The `requests.post()` function is called with both `data` and `headers` arguments to send the POST request with the necessary authentication. \n\nMake sure to replace `'your_user_id'`, `'your_password'`, and `https://api.example.com/endpoint` with your actual User ID, password, and the API endpoint URL respectively."
