        "content": "Certainly! Comparative adjectives are used to compare differences between the attributes of two entities. When it comes to speed, using comparative adjectives can highlight how the speed of a car compares to that of other vehicles. Here are three examples:\n\n1. **Faster**: If you say \"The car is faster than the bicycle,\" it implies that the car's speed surpasses that of the bicycle, indicating a higher rate of motion.\n\n2. **Slower**: In contrast, if you say \"The car is slower than the race car,\" it suggests that the car doesn\u2019t move as quickly as the race car, showing a reduced pace.\n\n3. **Quicker**: If you say \"The car is quicker than the truck,\" it indicates that the car accelerates or reaches higher speeds more rapidly than the truck.\n\nEach of these comparative adjectives modifies \"fast\" by providing a specific context of comparison, allowing for a clearer understanding of how the car's speed measures up to other vehicles."
