        "content": "To run a Python script as a command-line program without explicitly calling the `python` command, you can make the script executable and create a symbolic link or add it to your PATH. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n1. **Add a Shebang Line:**\n\n   At the top of your Python script (`script1.py`), add a shebang line to specify the interpreter. This line tells the system which interpreter to use. Typically, it looks like this:\n\n   ```python\n   #!/usr/bin/env python3\n   ```\n\n   This line ensures that the script will use the Python 3 interpreter that is in the user's PATH.\n\n2. **Make the Script Executable:**\n\n   Use the `chmod` command to make your script executable. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory containing your script, then run:\n\n   ```bash\n   chmod +x /path/to/script1.py\n   ```\n\n3. **Rename or Link the Script:**\n\n   You have a couple of options here:\n\n   - **Rename the Script:**\n\n     You can rename your script to the desired command name and place it in a directory that's in your PATH (like `/usr/local/bin` for system-wide access, or `~/bin` for user-specific access).\n\n     ```bash\n     mv /path/to/script1.py /usr/local/bin/arbitraryname\n     ```\n\n     Make sure `/usr/local/bin` is in your PATH, or adjust the path to a directory that is.\n\n   - **Create a Symbolic Link:**\n\n     Alternatively, you can create a symbolic link to your script with the desired command name in a directory that's in your PATH.\n\n     ```bash\n     ln -s /path/to/script1.py /usr/local/bin/arbitraryname\n     ```\n\n4. **Run Your Script as a Command:**\n\n   Now you can run your script from anywhere in the terminal by simply typing:\n\n   ```bash\n   arbitraryname\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, your script will behave like a regular command-line program, allowing you to execute it without explicitly calling Python."
