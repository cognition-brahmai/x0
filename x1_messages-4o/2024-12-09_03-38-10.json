I have a piece of code where I initialize three dictionaries `dict_a`, `dict_b`, and `dict_c` as empty, and then assign a key-value pair in `dict_c`. I expected only `dict_c` to have this key-value pair, but it seems that the key-value pair has also been added to `dict_a` and `dict_b`. Why is this happening?\n\nHere is the code I tried:\n```python\ndict_a = dict_b = dict_c = {}\ndict_c['hello'] = 'goodbye'\n\nprint(dict_a)\nprint(dict_b)\nprint(dict_c)\n```\nI expected the output to be:\n```python\n{}\n{}\n{'hello': 'goodbye'}\n```\nBut the actual output was:\n```python\n{'hello': 'goodbye'}\n{'hello': 'goodbye'}\n{'hello': 'goodbye'}\n```"

        "content": "In your code, the assignment operation `dict_a = dict_b = dict_c = {}` creates a single dictionary object in memory, and all three variables `dict_a`, `dict_b`, and `dict_c` are references to this same dictionary object. Therefore, when you modify the dictionary through any of these references, the changes are reflected in all of them because they all point to the same object.\n\nIn Python, assignment does not create a copy of the object; it simply assigns a reference to the object. That's why when you add the key-value pair `{'hello': 'goodbye'}` to `dict_c`, it also appears in `dict_a` and `dict_b`.\n\nTo achieve the behavior you were expecting, you need to create separate dictionary objects for each variable:\n\n```python\ndict_a = {}\ndict_b = {}\ndict_c = {}\n\ndict_c['hello'] = 'goodbye'\n\nprint(dict_a)  # Outputs: {}\nprint(dict_b)  # Outputs: {}\nprint(dict_c)  # Outputs: {'hello': 'goodbye'}\n```\n\nThis way, each variable points to its own distinct dictionary object, and changes to one do not affect the others."
