The list is given as follows:\n\n```python\n['Jellicle', 'Cats', 'are', 'black', 'and', 'white,', 'Jellicle', 'Cats', 'are', 'rather', 'small;', 'Jellicle', 'Cats', 'are', 'merry', 'and', 'bright,', 'And', 'pleasant', 'to', 'hear', 'when', 'they', 'caterwaul.', 'Jellicle', 'Cats', 'have', 'cheerful', 'faces,', 'Jellicle', 'Cats', 'have', 'bright', 'black', 'eyes;', 'They', 'like', 'to', 'practise', 'their', 'airs', 'and', 'graces', 'And', 'wait', 'for', 'the', 'Jellicle', 'Moon', 'to', 'rise.', '']\n```\nI am trying to count how many times each word appears and display the top 3. However, I am only looking to find the top three that have the first letter capitalized and ignore all words that do not have the first letter capitalized. My initial approach was to put the first word in the list into another list called uniquewords, delete the first word and all its duplicates from the original list, and then add the new first word into unique words and so on until the original list is empty. After that, I was planning to count how many times each word in uniquewords appears in the original list and then find the top 3 and print them. Is there a more efficient way to achieve this?"

        "content": "Certainly! There is a more efficient way to achieve this using Python's built-in capabilities. You can utilize the `collections.Counter` class to count the occurrences of each word efficiently. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\n    'Jellicle', 'Cats', 'are', 'black', 'and', 'white,', 'Jellicle', 'Cats', 'are', \n    'rather', 'small;', 'Jellicle', 'Cats', 'are', 'merry', 'and', 'bright,', 'And', \n    'pleasant', 'to', 'hear', 'when', 'they', 'caterwaul.', 'Jellicle', 'Cats', 'have', \n    'cheerful', 'faces,', 'Jellicle', 'Cats', 'have', 'bright', 'black', 'eyes;', 'They', \n    'like', 'to', 'practise', 'their', 'airs', 'and', 'graces', 'And', 'wait', 'for', \n    'the', 'Jellicle', 'Moon', 'to', 'rise.', ''\n]\n\n# Filter the words to include only those with the first letter capitalized\ncapitalized_words = [word for word in words if word.istitle()]\n\n# Count the occurrences of each capitalized word\nword_counter = Counter(capitalized_words)\n\n# Get the top 3 most common capitalized words\ntop_three = word_counter.most_common(3)\n\n# Print the results\nfor word, count in top_three:\n    print(f\"'{word}' appears {count} times\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Filtering Capitalized Words**: We first filter the list to include only words that have the first letter capitalized using `word.istitle()`. This function checks if the first letter of the word is uppercase and the rest are lowercase.\n\n2. **Counting Occurrences**: We then use `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each capitalized word. `Counter` creates a dictionary-like object where keys are the words and values are their counts.\n\n3. **Finding Top 3**: We use the `most_common(3)` method of `Counter` to get the top 3 most common capitalized words.\n\nThis approach is more efficient and concise than manually iterating through the list and removing duplicates."
