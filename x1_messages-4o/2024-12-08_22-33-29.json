However, the messages are not written in plain language but are instead represented by a series of numbers.\nTo decode the message, you'll need to identify the pattern used to convert the letters of the alphabet into numbers. Once you have identified the pattern, you can apply it to the coded message to uncover its true meaning.\nFor example, if the letter \"A\" is represented by the number \"1\", then the word \"CAT\" would be represented as \"3-1-20\". Your task is to decipher the following message using the same pattern:\n18-5-1-4 23-15-18-11 20-15 3-1-14 20-8-5 12-5-1-2-5-18-19-8-9-16\nGood luck!"

For example, A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, and so on, up to Z = 26.\n\nLet's decode the given message:\n\n- 18 = R\n- 5 = E\n- 1 = A\n- 4 = D\n\nSo, \"18-5-1-4\" translates to \"READ\".\n\n- 23 = W\n- 15 = O\n- 18 = R\n- 11 = K\n\nSo, \"23-15-18-11\" translates to \"WORK\".\n\n- 20 = T\n- 15 = O\n\nSo, \"20-15\" translates to \"TO\".\n\n- 3 = C\n- 1 = A\n- 14 = N\n\nSo, \"3-1-14\" translates to \"CAN\".\n\n- 20 = T\n- 8 = H\n- 5 = E\n\nSo, \"20-8-5\" translates to \"THE\".\n\n- 12 = L\n- 5 = E\n- 1 = A\n- 2 = B\n- 5 = E\n- 18 = R\n- 19 = S\n- 8 = H\n- 9 = I\n- 16 = P\n\nSo, \"12-5-1-2-5-18-19-8-9-16\" translates to \"LEADERSHIP\".\n\nPutting it all together, the decoded message is:\n\n\"READ WORK TO CAN THE LEADERSHIP\"\n\nThis seems like a message emphasizing the importance of working towards and understanding leadership."
