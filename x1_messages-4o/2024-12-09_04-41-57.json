        "content": "To split strings into text and numbers in Python, you can use regular expressions provided by the `re` module. Here's a simple way to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef split_text_and_number(s):\n    # Use a regular expression to split the string into text and number\n    match = re.match(r\"([a-zA-Z]+)(\\d+)\", s)\n    if match:\n        return [match.group(1), match.group(2)]\n    return [s, \"\"]\n\n# Example usage\nstrings = ['foofo21', 'bar432', 'foobar12345']\nresult = [split_text_and_number(s) for s in strings]\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- `re.match(r\"([a-zA-Z]+)(\\d+)\", s)`:\n  - `([a-zA-Z]+)`: This part of the regex matches one or more alphabetic characters (both lowercase and uppercase).\n  - `(\\d+)`: This matches one or more digits.\n  - The parentheses `()` are used to capture the matching groups.\n\n- `match.group(1)`: Retrieves the first captured group (the text part).\n- `match.group(2)`: Retrieves the second captured group (the number part).\n\nBy running this script, you'll get the desired output:\n\n```\n[['foofo', '21'], ['bar', '432'], ['foobar', '12345']]\n```\n\nThis approach assumes that each string has text followed by numbers. Adjust the regular expression if your strings have a different pattern."
