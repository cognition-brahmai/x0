Use a.empty, a.bool(), a.item(), a.any() or a.all()\n```\n\nIs there a way to achieve this without using loops?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the way comparison operations work with Pandas Series objects. In Pandas, you can't use chained comparison operators directly like you would with scalar values. Instead, you should use bitwise operators to combine conditions. Here's how you can filter the DataFrame `df` to only include rows where the 'closing_price' is between 99 and 101:\n\n```python\ndf_filtered = df[(df['closing_price'] >= 99) & (df['closing_price'] <= 101)]\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the code:\n\n- `(df['closing_price'] >= 99)` creates a boolean Series that is `True` for rows where the 'closing_price' is greater than or equal to 99.\n- `(df['closing_price'] <= 101)` creates another boolean Series that is `True` for rows where the 'closing_price' is less than or equal to 101.\n- The `&` operator is used to perform an element-wise logical AND operation between the two boolean Series.\n- The result is a boolean Series that is `True` for rows where both conditions are met, which you then use to index the DataFrame `df`.\n\nMake sure to use parentheses around each condition to ensure proper precedence of operations."
