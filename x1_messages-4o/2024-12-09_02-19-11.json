The second element of `x` is the string `'Hip'`.\n3. The first element of `x` is neither a number nor a Boolean.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid_list(x):\n    # Check if the list has three or five elements\n    length_check = len(x) == 3 or len(x) == 5\n    \n    # Check if the second element is 'Hip'\n    second_element_check = x[1] == 'Hip'\n    \n    # Check if the first element is not a number or Boolean\n    first_element_check = not isinstance(x[0], (int, float, bool))\n    \n    # Combine all conditions\n    return length_check and second_element_check and first_element_check\n\n# Example usage:\nx = ['Hello', 'Hip', 42]\nprint(is_valid_list(x))  # Output: True\n\nx = [True, 'Hip', 'World', 1, 2]\nprint(is_valid_list(x))  # Output: False\n```\n\nIn this function:\n\n- `length_check` verifies that the list has either three or five elements.\n- `second_element_check` ensures that the second element is `'Hip'`.\n- `first_element_check` checks that the first element is not an instance of `int`, `float`, or `bool`, which covers numbers and Booleans.\n\nThe function `is_valid_list` returns `True` if all conditions are met, and `False` otherwise. Adjust the list `x` as needed to test different cases."
