Now I want to set it up on my machine for development. However, I'm unsure of how to do this. I prefer not to download libcurl files and compile that along with pycurl, but I want to know the simplest method. I already have libcurl installed on my machine. I tried downloading the sources and using the pycurl setup script, but I was unsuccessful."

        "content": "To install pyCurl on your Windows machine without the need to manually compile it alongside libcurl, you can use pre-compiled binary wheels available via `pip`. This is the simplest method to get pyCurl up and running. Here are the steps you can follow:\n\n1. **Ensure Python and pip are installed:**\n   Make sure you have Python installed on your machine, along with pip (Python's package installer). You can check this by running:\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   pip --version\n   ```\n\n2. **Upgrade pip:**\n   It's a good idea to have the latest version of pip to ensure compatibility and access to the latest packages:\n   ```bash\n   python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n   ```\n\n3. **Install pyCurl:**\n   You can install pyCurl directly using pip, which will automatically handle downloading and installing the appropriate binary wheel for your system:\n   ```bash\n   pip install pycurl\n   ```\n\n   If you encounter issues with pip not finding a suitable wheel, you might need to specify the `curl` backend explicitly. For example:\n   ```bash\n   pip install pycurl --only-binary :all:\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify installation:**\n   After installation, you can verify that pyCurl is installed correctly by trying to import it in a Python shell:\n   ```python\n   import pycurl\n   print(pycurl.version)\n   ```\n\nThis method should work seamlessly if you have a relatively recent version of Python and pip. If you encounter any issues, ensure that your Python environment is set up correctly and that there are no conflicting packages installed."
