I'd like to avoid changing the module name as it is being used in multiple places and changing the name would require significant changes in the codebase. Is there a way to load a Python module whose name contains the typically forbidden '-'?"

        "content": "Yes, you can import a Python module with a name that includes a dash ('-'), although it's not conventional and goes against Python's typical naming conventions. However, you can use the `importlib` module, which allows for more flexibility in importing modules.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using `importlib`**: You can use the `importlib.import_module` function to import the module by replacing the dash with an underscore in the module name and then using the `spec_from_file_location` and `module_from_spec` functions to load it.\n\n```python\nimport importlib.util\nimport sys\n\n# Path to the module\nmodule_path = 'path/to/foo-bar.py'\n\n# Create a module specification from the file location\nspec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location('foo_bar', module_path)\n\n# Create a module based on the specification\nfoo_bar = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)\n\n# Execute the module\nspec.loader.exec_module(foo_bar)\n\n# Now you can use foo_bar as a regular module\nfoo_bar.some_function()\n```\n\n2. **Renaming in your code**: Another approach is to rename the file when you import it, but keep the original file name so other dependent code doesn't break. You can create a symbolic link or copy it to a temporary file with a valid Python module name and import it from there.\n\n3. **Using `__import__`**: You can also use the built-in `__import__` function with a workaround by modifying `sys.modules`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Temporarily replace the dash with an underscore in the module name\nmodule_name = 'foo_bar'\noriginal_name = 'foo-bar'\n\n# Import the module using __import__\nsys.modules[module_name] = __import__(original_name)\n\n# Use the module\nfoo_bar = sys.modules[module_name]\nfoo_bar.some_function()\n```\n\nKeep in mind that these methods are workarounds and it's generally advisable to follow Python's naming conventions by using underscores instead of dashes in module names. But if it's necessary to retain the current module name, these methods can help you achieve that."
