        "content": "The error you're encountering, `pyspark.sql.utils.AnalysisException: u\"Reference 'id' is ambiguous,\"`, suggests that there are multiple columns named `id` in your DataFrame, which is causing ambiguity when you try to reference it.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check for Duplicate Columns**: First, you should verify if there are indeed multiple columns with the same name in your DataFrame. You can do this by printing the schema or column names:\n\n   ```python\n   print(df.columns)\n   ```\n\n2. **Rename the Duplicate Columns**: If there are duplicate columns, you will need to rename them to unique names. You can do this while reading the data or by using the `withColumnRenamed` method.\n\n3. **Reorder Columns**: Once you've ensured all column names are unique, you can reorder them as desired.\n\nHere's how you can rename the duplicate columns and reorder them:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\n# Assuming spark session is already created\n# spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()\n\n# Example of renaming duplicate 'id' column if found\ndf = df.withColumnRenamed('id', 'id_duplicate')  # Rename the duplicate one\n\n# Now rearrange the columns\nchange_cols = ['id', 'name']  # Assuming 'id' is the original column\n\n# Create a new column order\ncols = ([col for col in change_cols if col in df.columns] \n        + [col for col in df.columns if col not in change_cols])\n\n# Reorder the DataFrame columns\ndf = df.select(cols)\n\n# Show the updated schema or columns\ndf.printSchema()\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `'id_duplicate'` with the actual name you decide to give to the duplicate column. Adjust accordingly based on your specific DataFrame structure."
