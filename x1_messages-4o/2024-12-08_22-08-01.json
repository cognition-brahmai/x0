The range must be within the maximum limit of the program and non-numeric inputs must be handled. However, the catch is that the table is constructed using a loop construct that requires reasoning to identify the corresponding ASCII character codes. Are you up for the challenge?"

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step.\n\n**Objective:**\nConstruct a table that maps ASCII character codes to their corresponding characters for a user-defined range of numbers.\n\n**Steps to Solve:**\n\n1. **User Input:** First, we need to get a valid range from the user. This range should be numeric and within the permissible ASCII range (0 to 127).\n\n2. **Validation:**\n   - Ensure the inputs are numeric.\n   - Ensure the range is within the ASCII limits.\n\n3. **Loop Construction:**\n   - Use a loop to iterate through the specified range.\n   - For each number, determine the ASCII character using the `chr()` function in Python (or equivalent in other languages).\n\n4. **Table Construction:**\n   - Create a table with two columns: one for the numerical value and one for the corresponding ASCII character.\n\n5. **Output:**\n   - Display the table to the user.\n\nHere's a simple Python example to illustrate this process:\n\n```python\ndef ascii_table(start, end):\n    # Validate input range\n    if not (0 <= start <= 127) or not (0 <= end <= 127):\n        return \"Please ensure your range is between 0 and 127.\"\n    if start > end:\n        return \"Start of range must be less than or equal to end of range.\"\n\n    # Construct table\n    table = \"Number\\tCharacter\\n\"\n    for num in range(start, end + 1):\n        table += f\"{num}\\t{chr(num)}\\n\"\n\n    return table\n\n# Example usage\ntry:\n    start = int(input(\"Enter the start of the range: \"))\n    end = int(input(\"Enter the end of the range: \"))\n    print(ascii_table(start, end))\nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"Please enter valid numeric inputs.\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- We ask the user to input the start and end of the range.\n- We validate that these inputs are within the 0 to 127 range and are numeric.\n- Using a loop, we iterate over the range, converting each number to its ASCII character using `chr()`.\n- Finally, we print the table.\n\nThis approach ensures that non-numeric inputs are handled gracefully, and the range is strictly within the ASCII limits. Let me know if you need further clarification or modification!"
