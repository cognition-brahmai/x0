However, when I try to use tqdm with the built-in zip object to iterate over two corresponding lists, the progressbar that is printed to the console does not appear correctly. What is the correct way to use tqdm with zip to iterate over two corresponding lists with a console progressbar? \n\nThe incorrect progressbar is displayed with the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nfrom time import sleep\n\nfor _, _ in tqdm(zip(range(10), range(10))):\n    sleep(0.1)\n```\n\nI know I can use tqdm with enumerate as a workaround, but that requires defining and managing an iterator index, which I would prefer not to do."

        "content": "The issue you're facing with `tqdm` and `zip` is because `zip` itself doesn't have a defined length, so `tqdm` can't automatically determine how many iterations it will perform. To resolve this, you can provide a `total` argument to `tqdm`, explicitly specifying the number of iterations, which is the length of the lists you're iterating over.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to work correctly:\n\n```python\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nfrom time import sleep\n\nlist1 = range(10)\nlist2 = range(10)\n\n# Using len(list1) or len(list2) as they are of the same length\nfor _, _ in tqdm(zip(list1, list2), total=len(list1)):\n    sleep(0.1)\n```\n\nBy providing the `total` parameter, `tqdm` can accurately display the progress bar because it knows the total number of iterations it should expect. This way, you can avoid using `enumerate` and still have a correctly functioning progress bar."
