In order to achieve this, the basic functions of filterOdd, filterGreaterThan5, and mapAddTwo can be used for composition. Specifically, the objective is to find the sum of all odd numbers greater than 5 in the following list: [3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 15]. In addition to solving the problem, can you explain how function composition simplifies code and increases modularity in programming? Furthermore, can you provide an example of how function composition can be utilized in object-oriented programming to enhance code organization and maintainability?"

        "content": "To achieve the task of obtaining the sum of all odd numbers greater than 5 in a list of integers using function composition in Scala, we can use three basic functions: `filterOdd`, `filterGreaterThan5`, and `mapAddTwo`. Here's how you can implement this in Scala:\n\n```scala\nobject FunctionCompositionExample extends App {\n  // Function to filter odd numbers\n  def filterOdd(numbers: List[Int]): List[Int] = numbers.filter(_ % 2 != 0)\n  \n  // Function to filter numbers greater than 5\n  def filterGreaterThan5(numbers: List[Int]): List[Int] = numbers.filter(_ > 5)\n  \n  // Function to add two to each number (although not needed for sum)\n  def mapAddTwo(numbers: List[Int]): List[Int] = numbers.map(_ + 2)\n  \n  // Composing the functions to get the desired result\n  val numbers = List(3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 15)\n  val result = filterOdd _ andThen filterGreaterThan5 _ // Composing functions\n  \n  // Applying composed function and calculating the sum\n  val sumOfOddGreaterThan5 = result(numbers).sum\n  \n  println(s\"The sum of all odd numbers greater than 5 is: $sumOfOddGreaterThan5\")\n}\n\nFunctionCompositionExample.main(Array())\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Function Composition**: In Scala, you can compose functions using `andThen` or `compose`. The `andThen` method is used to apply one function after another. This can simplify code by making it more declarative and easier to follow. In the example above, `filterOdd` is applied first, followed by `filterGreaterThan5`.\n\n2. **Modularity**: Function composition increases modularity by allowing you to break down complex operations into smaller, reusable functions. Each function handles a specific task, making the code easier to maintain and test.\n\n3. **Code Simplification**: By composing functions, you reduce the need for intermediate variables and loops, leading to more concise and readable code.\n\n### Function Composition in Object-Oriented Programming\n\nIn object-oriented programming, function composition can be used to enhance code organization and maintainability. Here's an example:\n\n```scala\nclass NumberProcessor(numbers: List[Int]) {\n  def filterOdd: NumberProcessor = new NumberProcessor(numbers.filter(_ % 2 != 0))\n  \n  def filterGreaterThan5: NumberProcessor = new NumberProcessor(numbers.filter(_ > 5))\n  \n  def sum: Int = numbers.sum\n}\n\nobject OOPCompositionExample extends App {\n  val numbers = List(3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 15)\n  val processor = new NumberProcessor(numbers)\n  \n  // Chaining methods to achieve function composition\n  val sumOfOddGreaterThan5 = processor.filterOdd.filterGreaterThan5.sum\n  \n  println(s\"The sum of all odd numbers greater than 5 is: $sumOfOddGreaterThan5\")\n}\n\nOOPCompositionExample.main(Array())\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Encapsulation**: The `NumberProcessor` class encapsulates the list of numbers and provides methods to process them. This encapsulation hides the complexity of operations from the outside world.\n  \n- **Fluent Interface**: Method chaining provides a fluent interface, making the code readable and resembling natural language.\n\n- **Maintainability**: By organizing related functionality within a class, the code becomes easier to maintain. Changes to filtering logic, for instance, are localized within the class and don't affect the rest of the codebase.\n\nOverall, function composition in both functional and object-oriented paradigms enhances modularity, simplifies code, and makes it more maintainable by promoting the reuse of well-defined, single-purpose functions or methods."
