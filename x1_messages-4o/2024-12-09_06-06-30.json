I have figured out how to access the details of the exception using the following code: \n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport traceback\n\ntry:\n    1/0\nexcept:\n    exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback = sys.exc_info()\n    traceback.print_exception(exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback)\n```\nHowever, I would like to know how to capture the string that the `print_exception()` function throws to stdout so that I can log it."

        "content": "To capture the exception details as a string instead of printing them directly to the standard output, you can use the `traceback` module's `format_exception` function, which returns the exception information as a list of strings. You can then concatenate these strings and log them using a logging framework like Python's built-in `logging` module.\n\nHere's an example of how to do that:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport traceback\nimport logging\n\n# Configure the logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR, filename='error.log', filemode='w',\n                    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n\ntry:\n    1 / 0\nexcept:\n    exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback = sys.exc_info()\n    exception_details = traceback.format_exception(exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback)\n    exception_string = ''.join(exception_details)\n    \n    # Log the exception string\n    logging.error(\"An exception occurred:\\n%s\", exception_string)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `format_exception` function is used to get a list of strings representing the traceback. These strings are then joined into a single string, which is logged using the `logging.error` method. The log is written to a file named `error.log`. You can customize the logging configuration to suit your needs, such as changing the log level or the output format."
