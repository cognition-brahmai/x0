        "content": "Einstein's Theory of Relativity is a fundamental theory in physics, encompassing two interrelated theories proposed by Albert Einstein: Special Relativity and General Relativity.\n\n1. **Special Relativity (1905):**\n   - **Principle of Relativity:** The laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another (inertial frames).\n   - **Speed of Light:** The speed of light in a vacuum is constant and is not dependent on the motion of the light source or observer, measured at approximately 299,792,458 meters per second.\n   - **Time Dilation:** Time appears to move slower for an object moving at high speeds compared to a stationary observer. This means that as an object approaches the speed of light, time for it slows down relative to an observer at rest.\n   - **Length Contraction:** Objects contract in length along the direction of motion as they approach the speed of light, as perceived by an external observer.\n   - **Mass-Energy Equivalence:** Expressed by the famous equation \\(E=mc^2\\), it states that mass and energy are interchangeable; mass can be converted into energy and vice versa.\n\n2. **General Relativity (1915):**\n   - **Principle of Equivalence:** Local observations in a freely falling reference frame cannot distinguish between uniform acceleration and gravitational fields.\n   - **Curvature of Spacetime:** Gravity is not a force but a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. Massive objects like stars and planets curve the spacetime around them, and this curvature affects the motion of other objects.\n   - **Geodesics:** Objects move along the shortest paths in curved spacetime, known as geodesics, which appear as gravitational attraction in classical mechanics.\n   - **Implications:** General Relativity predicts phenomena such as gravitational waves, the bending of light around massive objects (gravitational lensing), time dilation in gravitational fields (gravitational time dilation), and the expansion of the universe.\n\nEinstein's Theory of Relativity has been extensively validated through experiments and observations, revolutionizing our understanding of space, time, and gravity."
