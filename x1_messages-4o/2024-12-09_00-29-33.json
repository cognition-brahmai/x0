In my Request class, I have two foreign keys to the built-in User model. The code for my foreign keys is as follows:\n\n```python\ncreate_user = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='requests_created')\nassign_user = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='requests_assigned')\n```\n\nHowever, I'm encountering a clashing error that says \"Reverse accessor for 'Analysis.assign_user' clashes with reverse accessor for 'Inquiry.assign_user'.\" From what I understand, setting the `related_name` should prevent such clashes, but I'm still getting the error. Can anyone explain why this is happening and how to solve it?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with the reverse accessor clash arises because you're using the same `related_name` for the foreign keys in your base class `Request`, and both the `Inquiry` and `Analysis` models inherit from this base class. When Django attempts to generate reverse relations for the `User` model, it finds two foreign keys with the same `related_name` across different inherited models, leading to a clash.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to ensure that each foreign key relationship has a unique `related_name`. Since both `Inquiry` and `Analysis` inherit from `Request`, you can use Django's `related_name` feature to create distinct related names for each subclass. A common approach is to include the class name in the `related_name`. Here's how you can modify your `Request` class:\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass Request(models.Model):\n    create_user = models.ForeignKey(\n        User, \n        related_name='%(class)s_requests_created',\n        on_delete=models.CASCADE\n    )\n    assign_user = models.ForeignKey(\n        User, \n        related_name='%(class)s_requests_assigned',\n        on_delete=models.CASCADE\n    )\n\n    class Meta:\n        abstract = True\n\nclass Inquiry(Request):\n    # additional fields for Inquiry\n    pass\n\nclass Analysis(Request):\n    # additional fields for Analysis\n    pass\n```\n\nIn the `related_name` for each foreign key, `'%(class)s'` will be replaced by the lowercased name of the model class that inherits `Request` (i.e., `inquiry` or `analysis`). This way, Django will generate unique reverse accessor names for each model, avoiding any clashes."
