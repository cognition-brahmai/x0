However, when I include a piece of code where I am trying to associate lower level information with its parent by searching the database through the origin and destination coordinates with the time_stamp, I am getting an internal error stating \"Unread result found.\" This error seems to occur when more data is inserted using the cursor. I have attempted to dump any unread results as per advice, but I am still encountering the same error. The error message I get is \"No result set to fetch from\". Could the issue be that my query is too complex and needs splitting, or is there another issue at hand?"

        "content": "The \"Unread result found\" error typically occurs when you're attempting to execute a new query on a MySQL cursor while there are still unread results from a previous query. This can happen if you've executed a `SELECT` statement and haven't fetched all the results before executing another query using the same cursor.\n\nHere are a few things you can check and steps you can take to resolve this error:\n\n1. **Fetch All Results**: Ensure that after executing any `SELECT` statement, you've fetched all the results using methods like `fetchone()`, `fetchall()`, or by iterating over the cursor. This ensures that there are no unread results left in the cursor.\n\n2. **Separate Cursors**: Use separate cursors for reading from the database and writing to it. This can help prevent issues where unread results interfere with subsequent queries.\n\n3. **Close Cursors**: Always close cursors after you're done using them with `cursor.close()`. This releases any resources associated with the cursor and can help prevent these kinds of errors.\n\n4. **Commit Transactions**: If you're performing multiple insert operations, make sure to commit the transaction using `connection.commit()` after your inserts. This might not directly solve the unread result issue, but it's good practice to ensure data integrity.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Wrap your database operations in try-except blocks to catch and handle any exceptions that occur, which will help you diagnose the issue more effectively.\n\n6. **Debugging**: Add some debugging output to see exactly where the error occurs. Print statements or logging can be useful for tracking the flow of your program and identifying where things go wrong.\n\nHere's a basic structure to help you manage the cursors and connections:\n\n```python\nimport mysql.connector\n\ndef insert_json_data(json_data):\n    try:\n        # Connect to the database\n        connection = mysql.connector.connect(user='your_user', password='your_pass',\n                                             host='your_host', database='your_db')\n        cursor = connection.cursor()\n\n        # Parse and insert JSON data\n        for item in json_data:\n            # Example of inserting data\n            insert_query = \"INSERT INTO your_table (column1, column2) VALUES (%s, %s)\"\n            cursor.execute(insert_query, (item['field1'], item['field2']))\n\n            # Fetch or process more data if necessary\n            # Remember to fetch all results if executing a SELECT query\n            # Example: cursor.fetchall() or cursor.fetchone()\n\n        # Commit transactions\n        connection.commit()\n\n    except mysql.connector.Error as err:\n        print(f\"Error: {err}\")\n\n    finally:\n        # Close cursor and connection\n        if cursor:\n            cursor.close()\n        if connection:\n            connection.close()\n\n# Example JSON data\njson_data = [\n    {'field1': 'value1', 'field2': 'value2'},\n    # Add more items as needed\n]\n\ninsert_json_data(json_data)\n```\n\nIf you continue to encounter issues, consider whether your queries might be too complex or if there's a better way to structure your database interactions. You might also want to review the logic where you associate lower-level information with its parent, ensuring that any database reads are completed before additional writes."
