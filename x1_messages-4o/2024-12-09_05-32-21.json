I am trying to iterate over this dictionary with the following code:\n```\nfor r in results:\n     print r['key_name']\n```\nHowever, I am encountering an issue where the code breaks if a key does not have a value. The results show as `'key_name': None, 'next_key':...`. How can I handle this situation where a key might not have a value in my dictionary?"

        "content": "To handle situations where a key might not have a value in a dictionary, you can use the `get` method of a dictionary. This method allows you to specify a default value to return if the key does not exist or if its value is `None`. Here\u2019s how you can modify your code to handle this situation:\n\n```python\nfor r in results:\n    value = r.get('key_name', 'Default Value')\n    print(value)\n```\n\nIn this code, if `'key_name'` is not present in the dictionary `r` or if its value is `None`, `'Default Value'` will be printed instead. You can replace `'Default Value'` with any default value you prefer, such as an empty string or a message indicating the absence of a value. This approach helps ensure your code does not break when encountering missing or `None` values."
