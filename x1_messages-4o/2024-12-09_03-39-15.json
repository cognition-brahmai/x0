According to Python's documentation, `property()` is implemented in terms of the descriptor protocol. Here is the code for reference:\n\n```python\nclass Property(object):\n    \"Emulate PyProperty_Type() in Objects/descrobject.c\"\n\n    def __init__(self, fget=None, fset=None, fdel=None, doc=None):\n        self.fget = fget\n        self.fset = fset\n        self.fdel = fdel\n        if doc is None and fget is not None:\n            doc = fget.__doc__\n        self.__doc__ = doc\n\n    def __get__(self, obj, objtype=None):\n        if obj is None:\n            return self\n        if self.fget is None:\n            raise AttributeError(\"unreadable attribute\")\n        return self.fget(obj)\n\n    def __set__(self, obj, value):\n        if self.fset is None:\n            raise AttributeError(\"can't set attribute\")\n        self.fset(obj, value)\n\n    def __delete__(self, obj):\n        if self.fdel is None:\n            raise AttributeError(\"can't delete attribute\")\n        self.fdel(obj)\n\n    def getter(self, fget):\n        return type(self)(fget, self.fset, self.fdel, self.__doc__)\n\n    def setter(self, fset):\n        return type(self)(self.fget, fset, self.fdel, self.__doc__)\n\n    def deleter(self, fdel):\n        return type(self)(self.fget, self.fset, fdel, self.__doc__)\n```\n\nMy question is why the last three methods (getter, setter, and deleter) aren't implemented as follows:\n\n```python\n    def getter(self, fget):\n        self.fget = fget\n        return self\n\n    def setter(self, fset):\n        self.fset = fset\n        return self\n\n    def deleter(self, fdel):\n        self.fdel= fdel\n        return self\n```\n\nIs there a specific reason for returning new instances of property, internally pointing to essentially the same get and set functions?"

        "content": "The implementation of the `getter`, `setter`, and `deleter` methods in the provided `Property` class is designed to return a new instance of the property rather than modifying the existing one. This approach aligns with the functional programming principle of immutability and has several advantages:\n\n1. **Immutability**: By returning a new instance, the original property object remains unchanged, which can prevent potential side effects in the program. This immutability makes the design more robust and predictable, as modifying a property won't inadvertently affect other parts of the code using the same property instance.\n\n2. **Chaining**: Returning a new instance allows for method chaining. You can apply multiple decorators in a concise manner without modifying the existing instance. For example:\n   ```python\n   p = Property().getter(get_func).setter(set_func).deleter(del_func)\n   ```\n   This can be particularly useful for readability and maintaining a clean code base.\n\n3. **Consistency**: This pattern is consistent with the behavior of the built-in `property` function in Python, which also returns a new property object when you call `getter`, `setter`, or `deleter`. By mimicking this behavior, the custom `Property` class can be used interchangeably with Python's built-in properties without causing confusion.\n\n4. **Thread Safety**: If the property is being modified in a multi-threaded environment, returning a new instance ensures that threads do not interfere with each other's operations on the same property object.\n\nIn contrast, the alternative implementation that directly modifies the existing instance could lead to unintended side effects, especially in larger or more complex codebases where the same property instance might be shared across different parts of the application. By maintaining immutability and returning a new instance, the design ensures that each property configuration remains independent and encapsulated."
