I want to write a function that is a drop-in and can be used by other code which expects to call a generator, but doesn't necessarily require results from it. Currently, I'm using the below code which uses an unreachable yield statement to declare the function as a generator. Is there a more expressive way to achieve this?\n\n```python\ndef empty_generator():\n    # ... do some stuff, but don't yield anything\n    if False:\n        yield\n```"

        "content": "Certainly! Your current approach using an unreachable `yield` statement is one way to define a generator function that never yields anything. However, there is a more expressive and slightly more Pythonic way to achieve this by using the `return` statement in a generator function. When a generator function encounters a `return` statement without a value, it stops execution and raises a `StopIteration` exception, effectively ending the generator without yielding any values.\n\nHere's how you can write such a generator function:\n\n```python\ndef empty_generator():\n    # ... do some stuff, but don't yield anything\n    return\n```\n\nBy using `return`, you clearly indicate that the generator function completes without yielding any values. This approach is clean and straightforward, making it clear to anyone reading the code that the function is intended not to yield anything.\n\nIf you need to perform some operations within the function but still want it to act as a generator without yielding any values, this method will work perfectly. The function will be recognized as a generator because it uses the `yield` keyword implicitly by being a generator function, even though it never actually yields."
