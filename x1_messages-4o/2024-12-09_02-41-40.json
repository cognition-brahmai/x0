I am currently using regular expressions, but I am wondering if there is a more efficient or pythonic way to achieve this. Here is a sample of the data I am working with and the current code I have written. \n\n```python\nSample text\n\nA selection of students from Riverdale High and Hogwarts took part in a quiz. This is a record of their scores.\n\nSchool = Riverdale High\nGrade = 1\nStudent number, Name\n0, Phoebe\n1, Rachel\n\nStudent number, Score\n0, 3\n1, 7\n\nGrade = 2\nStudent number, Name\n0, Angela\n1, Tristan\n2, Aurora\n\nStudent number, Score\n0, 6\n1, 3\n2, 9\n\nSchool = Hogwarts\nGrade = 1\nStudent number, Name\n0, Ginny\n1, Luna\n\nStudent number, Score\n0, 8\n1, 7\n\nGrade = 2\nStudent number, Name\n0, Harry\n1, Hermione\n\nStudent number, Score\n0, 5\n1, 10\n\nGrade = 3\nStudent number, Name\n0, Fred\n1, George\n\nStudent number, Score\n0, 0\n1, 0\n\n```\n\nAnd the code:\n\n```python\nimport re\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef parse(filepath):\n    \"\"\"\n    Parse text at given filepath\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    filepath : str\n        Filepath for file to be parsed\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    data : pd.DataFrame\n        Parsed data\n\n    \"\"\"\n\n    data = []\n    with open(filepath, 'r') as file:\n        line = file.readline()\n        while line:\n            reg_match = _RegExLib(line)\n\n            if reg_match.school:\n                school = reg_match.school.group(1)\n\n            if reg_match.grade:\n                grade = reg_match.grade.group(1)\n                grade = int(grade)\n\n            if reg_match.name_score:\n                value_type = reg_match.name_score.group(1)\n                line = file.readline()\n                while line.strip():\n                    number, value = line.strip().split(',')\n                    value = value.strip()\n                    dict_of_data = {\n                        'School': school,\n                        'Grade': grade,\n                        'Student number': number,\n                        value_type: value\n                    }\n                    data.append(dict_of_data)\n                    line = file.readline()\n\n            line = file.readline()\n\n        data = pd.DataFrame(data)\n        data.set_index(['School', 'Grade', 'Student number'], inplace=True)\n        # consolidate df to remove nans\n        data = data.groupby(level=data.index.names).first()\n        # upgrade Score from float to integer\n        data = data.apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='ignore')\n    return data\n\nclass _RegExLib:\n    \"\"\"Set up regular expressions\"\"\"\n    # use https://regexper.com to visualise these if required\n    _reg_school = re.compile('School = (.*)\\n')\n    _reg_grade = re.compile('Grade = (.*)\\n')\n    _reg_name_score = re.compile('(Name|Score)')\n\n    def __init__(self, line):\n        # check whether line has a positive match with all of the regular expressions\n        self.school = self._reg_school.match(line)\n        self.grade = self._reg_grade.match(line)\n        self.name_score = self._reg_name_score.search(line)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    filepath = 'sample.txt'\n    data = parse(filepath)\n    print(data)\n```"

        "content": "To parse complex text files into a pandas DataFrame, you can use a combination of string manipulation, pandas functionalities, and regular expressions. Your current approach with regular expressions is valid, but there are a few ways to make it more efficient and Pythonic. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Use Context Managers Properly:** You are already using a context manager with `open()`, but ensure you encapsulate operations in functions properly to maintain readability and reusability.\n\n2. **Optimize Regular Expressions:** Your use of regular expressions is good, but ensure they're as efficient as possible.\n\n3. **DataFrame Manipulation:** Use pandas' powerful capabilities to handle data more efficiently, especially when it comes to merging or reshaping data.\n\n4. **Avoid Nested Loops:** Consider using functions to handle specific tasks, reducing complexity in your main parsing loop.\n\nHere's a revised version of your code with these suggestions in mind:\n\n```python\nimport re\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef parse(filepath):\n    data = []\n    school = grade = None\n    \n    with open(filepath, 'r') as file:\n        for line in file:\n            line = line.strip()\n            if not line:\n                continue\n\n            if line.startswith(\"School = \"):\n                school = line.split(\" = \")[1]\n\n            elif line.startswith(\"Grade = \"):\n                grade = int(line.split(\" = \")[1])\n\n            elif \"Name\" in line or \"Score\" in line:\n                value_type = \"Name\" if \"Name\" in line else \"Score\"\n                continue  # Move to data lines\n\n            else:\n                parts = line.split(',')\n                student_number = int(parts[0].strip())\n                value = parts[1].strip()\n                \n                data.append({\n                    'School': school,\n                    'Grade': grade,\n                    'Student number': student_number,\n                    value_type: value\n                })\n\n    df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n    df.set_index(['School', 'Grade', 'Student number'], inplace=True)\n    df = df.groupby(level=df.index.names).first()\n    df = df.apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='ignore')\n\n    return df\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    filepath = 'sample.txt'\n    data = parse(filepath)\n    print(data)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n1. **Simplified Regular Expression Usage:** Instead of using a class for regex checks, I used simple Python string methods to extract required data.\n\n2. **Single Loop for File Reading:** Instead of reading the file line-by-line with nested loops, the code now uses a single loop with `continue` to manage control flow. This makes the loop easier to follow.\n\n3. **Data Extraction:** The extraction of `Name` or `Score` is streamlined to directly handle the values.\n\n4. **DataFrame Construction:** The DataFrame is constructed outside the loop, and pandas functionalities are used to set the index and handle numerical conversion.\n\nThis revised approach should be more efficient and maintainable for handling complex text files and converting them into a DataFrame."
