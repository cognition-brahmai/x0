I'm trying to add a new column that will contain boolean values indicating whether a given date is a holiday or not. I'm using the following code to achieve this but it doesn't seem to be working as all the values are coming up as False. This seems to be due to a type difference between the 'date' in the pandas dataframe and the 'holidays', but I'm not sure how to resolve this. Here's the problematic code:\n```python\ncal = USFederalHolidayCalendar()\nholidays = cal.holidays(start=train_df['date'].min(),\n                        end=train_df['date'].max()).to_pydatetime()\ntrain_df['holiday'] = train_df['date'].isin(holidays)\nprint type(train_df['date'][1])\nprint type(holidays[0])\n```\nHow can I correctly determine if a date in my dataframe is a holiday and assign the corresponding boolean value?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is likely due to a mismatch in the types between the dates in your DataFrame and the holidays list. The dates in your DataFrame might be in a `datetime64` format, whereas the holidays returned by `to_pydatetime()` are in `datetime.datetime` format. To resolve this, you need to ensure that both are in the same format for comparison.\n\nHere's how you can adjust your code to correctly determine if a date is a holiday:\n\n1. Convert the `date` column in your DataFrame to `datetime` format using `pd.to_datetime()`, if it isn't already.\n2. Convert the `holidays` to a set of date objects for efficient membership testing.\n\nHere's your revised code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom pandas.tseries.holiday import USFederalHolidayCalendar\n\n# Ensure your 'date' column is in datetime format\ntrain_df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(train_df['date'])\n\n# Initialize the calendar and get the holidays\ncal = USFederalHolidayCalendar()\nholidays = cal.holidays(start=train_df['date'].min(), end=train_df['date'].max())\n\n# Convert holidays to a set of dates (not datetime objects)\nholiday_dates = set(holidays.date)\n\n# Create a boolean column indicating if the date is a holiday\ntrain_df['holiday'] = train_df['date'].dt.date.isin(holiday_dates)\n\n# Check the types for debugging purposes\nprint(type(train_df['date'][1]))\nprint(type(next(iter(holiday_dates))))\n\n# Output the DataFrame to verify the changes\nprint(train_df)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `train_df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(train_df['date'])` ensures that all dates in your DataFrame are in the correct format.\n- `holidays.date` converts the `DatetimeIndex` to an array of `date` objects.\n- `set(holidays.date)` creates a set of dates for quick lookup.\n- `train_df['date'].dt.date.isin(holiday_dates)` converts the datetime column to just date objects to match the set of holidays, allowing for accurate comparison. \n\nThis should resolve the type mismatch issue and correctly identify the holidays."
