Here's a simple Python script that achieves this:\n\n```python\ndef count_word_occurrences(sentence):\n    # Split the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n    \n    # Create a dictionary to store the word counts\n    word_count = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through each word in the list of words\n    for word in words:\n        # Convert word to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive counting\n        word_lower = word.lower()\n        \n        # Remove any punctuation from the word\n        word_clean = ''.join(char for char in word_lower if char.isalnum())\n        \n        # Count the occurrences of each word\n        if word_clean in word_count:\n            word_count[word_clean] += 1\n        else:\n            word_count[word_clean] = 1\n    \n    return word_count\n\n# Test the function with the given sentence\nsentence = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\nresult = count_word_occurrences(sentence)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will give you the following output:\n\n```python\n{'the': 2, 'quick': 1, 'brown': 1, 'fox': 1, 'jumps': 1, 'over': 1, 'lazy': 1, 'dog': 1}\n```\n\nNote that this code converts all words to lowercase and removes punctuation to ensure accurate case-insensitive counting. If you want to keep the original case, you can adjust the code accordingly."
