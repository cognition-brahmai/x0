After fitting the model, I am trying to get the cluster centers in their original string representation. I am aware of 'km.cluster_centers_' property but I am unable to figure out how to get the relevant indices from my original 'docs' list. Here is my code:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n\nX = TfidfVectorizer().fit_transform(docs)\nkm = KMeans().fit(X)\n```\n\nCan you guide me on how to retrieve the cluster centers in the form of strings?"

        "content": "Certainly! When you use KMeans with text data, the cluster centers are represented in the feature space (TF-IDF space) as numerical vectors. To find the closest strings from your original `docs` list to these cluster centers, you can compute the similarity between each document's vector and the cluster centers, then select the document vectors that are closest to each cluster center. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\n\n# Sample documents\ndocs = [\"doc1 text\", \"doc2 text\", \"doc3 text\", \"doc4 text\"]\n\n# Vectorize the documents\nvectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\nX = vectorizer.fit_transform(docs)\n\n# Fit the KMeans model\nkmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=0).fit(X)\n\n# Retrieve the cluster centers\ncluster_centers = kmeans.cluster_centers_\n\n# Calculate the cosine similarity between each document vector and cluster centers\nsimilarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(X, cluster_centers)\n\n# Find the index of the closest document to each cluster center\nclosest_docs_indices = similarity_matrix.argmax(axis=0)\n\n# Retrieve the original strings corresponding to the cluster centers\nclosest_docs = [docs[index] for index in closest_docs_indices]\n\nprint(\"Cluster centers in original string representation:\")\nfor i, doc in enumerate(closest_docs):\n    print(f\"Cluster {i}: {doc}\")\n```\n\nIn this code, `cosine_similarity` is used to compute the similarity between each document vector and each cluster center. The `argmax` function is then used to find the index of the document vector that is closest to each cluster center. The original document strings are then retrieved using these indices."
