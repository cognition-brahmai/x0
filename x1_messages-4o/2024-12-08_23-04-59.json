Also, assume that the average utility bill for a tiny house is $100 per month, while a traditional home's utility bill is $200 per month. Finally, assume that a tiny house owner moves their home twice a year, costing $500 each time. \nHint: The savings from lower building and maintenance costs, utility bills, and increased mobility can add up quickly over time."
