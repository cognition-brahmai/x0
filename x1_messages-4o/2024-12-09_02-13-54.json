However, I am encountering an error when trying to assign a new character at a specific index in the string. The error I am getting is \"TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment\". My code looks like this:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(0,len(line)):\n     if (line[i]==\";\" and i in rightindexarray):\n         line[i]=\":\"\n```\n\nMy string could have any number of semicolons, such as \"Hei der! ; Hello there ;!;\". I know which semicolons I want to replace as I have their index in the string. Using replace does not work as I'm not able to use an index with it. How can I work around this to replace the semicolons with colons at specific indices?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is because strings in Python are immutable, meaning you cannot change them in place. However, you can construct a new string with the desired changes. Here's a way to achieve your goal by building a new string with the necessary replacements:\n\n```python\ndef replace_semicolons(line, rightindexarray):\n    # Convert the string to a list of characters\n    line_list = list(line)\n    \n    # Iterate over the indices in rightindexarray\n    for i in rightindexarray:\n        # Check if the character at the index is a semicolon\n        if line_list[i] == \";\":\n            # Replace the semicolon with a colon\n            line_list[i] = \":\"\n    \n    # Join the list back into a string\n    return ''.join(line_list)\n\n# Example usage\nline = \"Hei der! ; Hello there ;!;\"\nrightindexarray = [9, 23]  # Indices of the semicolons you want to replace\nnew_line = replace_semicolons(line, rightindexarray)\nprint(new_line)\n```\n\nIn this approach, we first convert the string into a list of characters, which allows us to modify individual elements. We then iterate over the `rightindexarray` to replace the semicolons at the specified indices with colons. Finally, we join the list back into a string and return it."
