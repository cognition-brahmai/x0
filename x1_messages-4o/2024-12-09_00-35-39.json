        "content": "How can I force a task on Apache Airflow to fail? I am using a python callable `process_csv_entries` to process entries from a CSV file. I want my task to be marked as successful only if all entries were processed successfully, otherwise the task should fail. My current implementation seems to be marking the task as successful regardless of the return value from the `process_csv_entries` function. How can I force the PythonOperator task to fail under the right conditions?\n\nHere is my current implementation:\n\n```python\ndef process_csv_entries(csv_file):\n    # Boolean \n    file_completely_parsed = <call_to_module_to_parse_csv>\n    return not file_completely_parsed\n\nCSV_FILE=<Sets path to csv file>\nt1 = PythonOperator(dag=dag,\n                      task_id='parse_csv_completely',\n                      python_callable=process_csv_entries,\n                      op_args=[CSV_FILE])\n```"

        "content": "To ensure that your Apache Airflow task fails when the CSV file is not completely parsed, you should raise an exception in your Python callable function if the processing is not successful. By raising an exception, Airflow will mark the task as failed, which is the desired behavior when there is an issue with processing the CSV file.\n\nHere's how you can modify your `process_csv_entries` function to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef process_csv_entries(csv_file):\n    # Call to module to parse csv\n    file_completely_parsed = <call_to_module_to_parse_csv>\n    \n    if not file_completely_parsed:\n        # Raise an exception if the file was not completely parsed\n        raise ValueError(\"CSV file was not completely parsed\")\n\n    # Return a success indicator or any other relevant information if needed\n    return \"CSV file parsed successfully\"\n\nCSV_FILE = <Sets path to csv file>\nt1 = PythonOperator(\n    dag=dag,\n    task_id='parse_csv_completely',\n    python_callable=process_csv_entries,\n    op_args=[CSV_FILE]\n)\n```\n\nIn this revised implementation, the `process_csv_entries` function checks if the file was completely parsed. If not, it raises a `ValueError`, which will cause the task to fail. If the file is completely parsed, the function simply returns a success message. You can adjust the exception type and message to suit your specific needs, but the key is to ensure an exception is raised when processing is incomplete."
