        "content": "I am using PyCharm Professional Edition 5.0 and I have it configured to use IPython when possible and to show interpreter afterwards in my Run/Debug Configurations. However, I am experiencing some issues with how this is handled in PyCharm. First, any input() in my programs return empty strings. Also, when an error occurs, I can't interact with the Program anymore. There is a lot of space between the last line in the Console and the current line. In IPython, the ...: prompt in a code block isn't indented 2 spaces and not aligned to the In [?]: prompt. When an error occurs, I get a traceback from the internals which I don't want to see. Also, when running a file, IPython needs to be started which takes some time, and when IPython is started, it prints a lot of text to the console which I don't want to see except for the version number. What's more, when I type something and press Up, it replaces what I have written with the last item of my history instead of replacing it with the last item of my history that start with what I have typed. Lastly, I want to have automatic code completion without having to press Ctrl + Space in the console. How can I resolve these issues?"

        "content": "To resolve the issues you're experiencing with using IPython in PyCharm Professional Edition 5.0, here are some steps and tips that you can follow:\n\n1. **Input() Returns Empty Strings:**\n   - This could be an issue with how the console handles input within PyCharm. One workaround is using a standard Python console for running scripts that require `input()`, or consider using a GUI-based input method if feasible.\n\n2. **Interactivity After Errors:**\n   - This is a common issue when using IPython within PyCharm. You might try updating both PyCharm and IPython to their latest versions, as newer versions might have addressed these issues. Alternatively, running your code in a standalone terminal may provide better interactivity.\n\n3. **Console Spacing and Prompts:**\n   - The formatting of the IPython prompt in PyCharm may not be customizable to the extent that it is in a standalone IPython shell. However, you can try adjusting the console font and line spacing in PyCharm's settings under `Editor > Font` and `Editor > General > Appearance`.\n\n4. **Traceback Customization:**\n   - To reduce the verbosity of tracebacks, you can configure IPython to use a simplified traceback format. This can be done by adding a configuration file (`ipython_config.py`) in the IPython profile directory and setting `c.TerminalInteractiveShell.showtraceback = 'minimal'`.\n\n5. **Startup Time and Console Output:**\n   - To minimize startup time and console output, you can configure IPython to run in a 'quiet' mode. Again, this can be adjusted in the `ipython_config.py` file with settings like `c.InteractiveShellApp.exec_lines = ['print(\"IPython started.\")']` to customize what gets printed on startup.\n\n6. **History Navigation:**\n   - The behavior you're describing is typical of how command history is managed in many shells. However, you can explore using `prompt_toolkit` features which can be configured through IPython to handle history navigation more intelligently, though it might require some manual configuration.\n\n7. **Automatic Code Completion:**\n   - PyCharm generally provides intelligent code completion within the editor. However, for the console, automatic completion might not be available. You can try using IPython's built-in completer by setting `c.Completer.use_jedi = False` in the IPython configuration, which can sometimes enhance the completion features.\n\nFor a more seamless experience, consider upgrading to a more recent version of PyCharm and IPython, as they likely have improved compatibility and features. Additionally, running your scripts in a dedicated terminal or using Jupyter Notebooks, which integrate IPython, can provide a more interactive and user-friendly environment."
