However, when I attempt to run the exe file, I encounter a `NameError: name 'exit' is not defined` error. I am currently using `import sys`, as suggested in the post \"name exit is not defined in python\". The Python script is running perfectly before compilation, after extensive testing of the command line arguments. My code is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport socket\nimport sys\n\nif len(sys.argv) == 1:\n    print(\"Usage:\")\n    print(\"PlanRequest [Request String] [Server IP (optional: assumes 127.0.0.1 if omitted)]\")\n    exit()\n\n#[do stuff with the request]\n```\nWhy am I receiving this error and how can I resolve it?"

        "content": "The `NameError: name 'exit' is not defined` error you're encountering is because `exit()` is not a built-in function in Python when running scripts outside of an interactive environment. In scripts, you should use `sys.exit()` instead of `exit()` to terminate the program.\n\nThe `exit()` function is a convenience function that is available in the Python interactive shell, but not when running scripts. Here's how you can modify your script to use `sys.exit()`:\n\n```python\nimport socket\nimport sys\n\nif len(sys.argv) == 1:\n    print(\"Usage:\")\n    print(\"PlanRequest [Request String] [Server IP (optional: assumes 127.0.0.1 if omitted)]\")\n    sys.exit()\n\n# [do stuff with the request]\n```\n\nBy replacing `exit()` with `sys.exit()`, your script should terminate as expected when run as a standalone executable."
