I am using the following steps to deploy the application and the steps to install pip are failing:\n\n``` \nscript:\n    - apt-get update\n    - apt-get install -y python-dev\n    - curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py\n    - python get-pip.py\n    ... and a few more steps\n```\nWhen I run `python get-pip.py`, I get the following error:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"get-pip.py\", line 24226, in <module>\n    main()\n  File \"get-pip.py\", line 199, in main\n    bootstrap(tmpdir=tmpdir)\n  File \"get-pip.py\", line 82, in bootstrap\n    from pip._internal.cli.main import main as pip_entry_point\n  File \"/tmp/tmpUgc5ng/pip.zip/pip/_internal/cli/main.py\", line 60\n    sys.stderr.write(f\"ERROR: {exc}\")\n                                   ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n```\nThis method worked until yesterday, but it's not working now. I initially thought the issue might be due to windows, but on checking in my local machine running Linux, these steps worked fine. What could be the issue and how can I resolve it?"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering suggests that there's a syntax error due to the use of an f-string, which is a feature that requires Python 3.6 or newer. The error likely indicates that the version of Python being used in your Bitbucket CI environment is older than 3.6.\n\nHere's how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Python Version**: Ensure that your CI environment is using Python 3.6 or newer. You can check the Python version by adding a step to your script:\n   ```bash\n   - python --version\n   ```\n\n2. **Install a Newer Python Version**: If the current version is older than 3.6, you need to install a newer version of Python. You can do this by adding the following steps before trying to install pip:\n   ```bash\n   - apt-get update\n   - apt-get install -y software-properties-common\n   - add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa\n   - apt-get update\n   - apt-get install -y python3.8 python3.8-dev python3.8-distutils\n   - curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py\n   - python3.8 get-pip.py\n   ```\n\n3. **Use Python 3 Explicitly**: Modify your script to use Python 3 explicitly. Replace `python` with `python3.8` (or whatever version you installed) when calling the get-pip script.\n\n4. **Update the Shebang Line in Scripts**: If you have any scripts or dependencies that might be defaulting to Python 2, update the shebang line at the top of those scripts to use Python 3.8:\n   ```bash\n   #!/usr/bin/env python3.8\n   ```\n\n5. **Alternative Approach**: Alternatively, if upgrading the Python version in the CI environment is not feasible, you could use a Docker container with the desired Python version. Modify your Bitbucket pipeline to use a Docker image that includes Python 3.6 or newer.\n\nBy ensuring that your CI environment is using a compatible version of Python, you should be able to resolve the syntax error and successfully install pip."
