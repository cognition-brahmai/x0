        "content": "To write a conditional `if` statement in Python to check if a variable `key` is less than 1 or greater than 34, you can use logical operators. The `or` operator is used to check if at least one of the conditions is true. Here\u2019s how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nkey = # assign your value here\n\nif key < 1 or key > 34:\n    print(\"The key is either less than 1 or greater than 34.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The key is between 1 and 34, inclusive.\")\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, the `if` statement checks two conditions: `key < 1` and `key > 34`. If either of those conditions is true, the code inside the `if` block will execute. If neither condition is true, meaning `key` is between 1 and 34 inclusive, the code inside the `else` block will execute. Make sure to replace the comment `# assign your value here` with the actual value or logic to assign a value to `key`."
