It is said to support thread-safe, memory-efficient appends, and pops from either side of the deque with approximately the same O(1) performance in either direction. However, when I decided to compare the performance of deque and list using ipython, I found that lists seem to perform better. Here are my comparison codes and their results:\n\n```python\nIn [31]: %timeit range(1, 10000).pop(0)\n10000 loops, best of 3: 114 us per loop\n\nIn [32]: %timeit deque(xrange(1, 10000)).pop() \n10000 loops, best of 3: 181 us per loop\n\nIn [33]: %timeit deque(range(1, 10000)).pop()\n1000 loops, best of 3: 243 us per loop\n```\n\nCould anyone explain what I might be doing wrong here?"

        "content": "It looks like there's a misunderstanding in the way you're performing the benchmark, which is affecting the results you're seeing. Let's go through a few points to clarify:\n\n1. **Initialization vs. Operation Time:**\n   - Your benchmark is measuring both the initialization of the `deque` and the `list`, along with the `pop` operation. The initialization time can dominate the result, especially for `deque` which is optimized for operations rather than creation.\n\n2. **`range` vs. `xrange`:**\n   - In Python 2, `range` returns a list, while `xrange` returns an xrange object (a generator-like object). Your timings show that you're using Python 2, as `xrange` is not available in Python 3. The `range(1, 10000)` in Python 2 creates a list, which is then copied into the `deque` upon initialization. This copying can add overhead.\n\n3. **Testing the Wrong Operation:**\n   - You're testing the `pop()` operation, which removes an element from the end. While `deque` provides O(1) complexity for pops from both ends, the performance can be slightly affected by other factors. The real strength of `deque` is when you need to `pop(0)` or `appendleft()`, operations that are O(n) for a list but O(1) for a `deque`.\n\nHere's how you could properly benchmark the operations you're interested in:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\nimport timeit\n\n# Benchmark pop from the left for list (O(n))\nlist_pop_left = timeit.timeit(\n    stmt='lst.pop(0)',\n    setup='lst = list(range(1, 10000))',\n    number=1000\n)\n\n# Benchmark pop from the left for deque (O(1))\ndeque_pop_left = timeit.timeit(\n    stmt='d.popleft()',\n    setup='from collections import deque; d = deque(range(1, 10000))',\n    number=1000\n)\n\nprint(f\"List pop left: {list_pop_left:.2f} us per loop\")\nprint(f\"Deque pop left: {deque_pop_left:.2f} us per loop\")\n```\n\nThis way, you'll be directly measuring the performance differences for the operations where `deque` is expected to outperform lists. You should see that `popleft()` for a `deque` is much faster than `pop(0)` for a list."
