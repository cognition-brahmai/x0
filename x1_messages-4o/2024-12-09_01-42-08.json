        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `tf.reset_default_graph()` was introduced in TensorFlow version 0.12. Since you are using TensorFlow version r0.11, this function is not available in your current setup. Here are a few options to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Upgrade TensorFlow**: The simplest solution is to upgrade your TensorFlow version to at least 0.12 or later, where `tf.reset_default_graph()` is available. You can upgrade TensorFlow by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade tensorflow\n   ```\n\n   After upgrading, ensure that your code and dependencies are compatible with the new version.\n\n2. **Manual Graph Reset**: If upgrading is not an option, you can manually manage the graph. You can create a new graph and set it as the default graph:\n\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n\n   # Create a new graph and set it as the default\n   graph = tf.Graph()\n   with graph.as_default():\n       # Your TensorFlow code here\n   ```\n\n   This approach allows you to work with fresh graph instances without needing `tf.reset_default_graph()`.\n\n3. **Workaround in Older Version**: If you must stick to TensorFlow r0.11, consider refactoring your code to avoid the need to reset the graph. This might involve restructuring your code to use sessions and graphs more explicitly, ensuring that each part of your code uses its own session and graph scope.\n\nIf possible, upgrading TensorFlow is the recommended approach as it will also provide you with new features and improvements."
