Here is the code I am currently using:\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1 import host_subplot\nimport mpl_toolkits.axisartist as AA\nimport numpy\nfig = plt.figure()\nplt.xlabel('Width')\nplt.ylabel('Height')\nax = fig.gca()\nax.plot(105, 200)\nplt.grid()\nplt.show()\n```\nHowever, it seems like points need to be plotted as either a list or equation. How can I modify this to plot a single point?"

        "content": "To plot a single point on a graph using Matplotlib, you should specify the marker style in the `plot` function. By default, the `plot` function connects points with lines, so you need to indicate that you only want a single point by using a marker symbol.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to plot a single point at the coordinates `(105, 200)`:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Create a new figure\nfig = plt.figure()\n\n# Set labels for the axes\nplt.xlabel('Width')\nplt.ylabel('Height')\n\n# Get the current axes instance\nax = fig.gca()\n\n# Plot a single point at (105, 200) with a marker\nax.plot(105, 200, marker='o', markersize=5, linestyle='')\n\n# Add a grid to the plot\nplt.grid()\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this modified code:\n- `marker='o'` specifies the type of marker to use for the point (a circle in this case).\n- `markersize=5` adjusts the size of the marker.\n- `linestyle=''` ensures that no line is drawn connecting points.\n\nThis will display a single point at the location `(105, 200)` on your graph. You can adjust the `markersize` and `marker` type as needed to better fit your visualization preferences."
