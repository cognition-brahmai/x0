Specifically, I've uploaded version 1.2.1.0-r4 of my package to PyPi and confirmed its version correctly using easy_install. However, when I try to install it using pip, it installs version 1.1.0.0 instead. Even when I specify the version to pip with `pip install -Iv tome==1.2.1.0-r4`, the message `Requested tome==1.2.1.0-r4, but installing version 1.1.0.0` is returned. I've also confirmed using `parse_version` that the version string on 1.2.1 is greater than that on 1.1.0 as shown:\n\n```python\n>>> from pkg_resources import parse_version as pv\n>>> pv('1.1.0.0') < pv('1.2.1.0-r4')\nTrue\n>>>\n```\n\nSo, why does pip choose to install version 1.1.0 instead?"

        "content": "There are a few reasons why `pip` might be installing an older version of your package even though a newer version is available on PyPI. Here are some possibilities to explore:\n\n1. **Version Specifiers or Constraints**: Check if there are any version specifiers or constraints in your `requirements.txt` file or elsewhere that might be limiting the version of the package being installed. For example, there might be a dependency specifying a maximum version or a version range that doesn't include `1.2.1.0-r4`.\n\n2. **Index URL Configuration**: Make sure that your `pip` configuration is pointing to the correct PyPI index. If you are using a private PyPI server or an alternate index, ensure that it's correctly configured to include your latest package version.\n\n3. **Caching Issues**: `pip` might be using a cached version of the package. You can try clearing the cache by using the command `pip cache purge` or by using the `--no-cache-dir` option when installing the package, like this:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --no-cache-dir tome==1.2.1.0-r4\n   ```\n\n4. **Pre-release Versions**: The version `1.2.1.0-r4` appears to potentially be a pre-release version due to the `-r4` suffix. By default, `pip` does not install pre-release versions unless explicitly allowed. You can try using the `--pre` flag to allow pre-release versions:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --pre tome==1.2.1.0-r4\n   ```\n\n5. **Version Naming Conventions**: Ensure that the version naming follows the conventions that `pip` expects. The suffix `-r4` might be interpreted as a pre-release or might not be correctly parsed as expected. Consider using standard versioning formats like `1.2.1.post4` or `1.2.1.4` if the existing format is causing issues.\n\n6. **Package Metadata**: Double-check the package metadata on PyPI to ensure that the version number is correctly registered and published. Sometimes, issues with the metadata can cause version mismatches.\n\n7. **PyPI Synchronization**: Ensure that the PyPI server has fully synchronized and that the new version is visible and available for download. Sometimes, there might be a delay in the availability of a new version.\n\nIf you've checked all the above possibilities and the issue persists, you might consider reaching out to the Python community or forums for more specific guidance related to your package setup."
