Streaming platforms like Netflix and Spotify already use AI algorithms to analyze users' viewing and listening habits, preferences, and interactions to suggest movies, TV shows, music, or podcasts that align with their tastes. By leveraging machine learning models, these platforms can continuously refine their recommendations, ensuring that users are presented with content they are likely to enjoy, thereby enhancing user engagement and satisfaction. This personalization not only helps retain subscribers but also introduces them to a wider range of content they might not have discovered otherwise."
