        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the way you're importing the `urlopen` function from the `urllib.request` module. You should import the module correctly and then use the `urlopen` function. Here's how you can fix the issue:\n\nInstead of importing `urlopen` directly, import the entire `urllib.request` module and then use `urlopen` as a method of that module. Here is the corrected code:\n\n```python\nimport urllib.request\nimport json\n\n# Open the URL\nresponse = urllib.request.urlopen(\"https://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/legislators?api_key='(myapikey)'\")\n\n# Read the data from the response\ndata = response.read()\n\n# Decode the data to a string\ndata_string = data.decode('utf-8')\n\n# Parse the JSON data\njson_data = json.loads(data_string)\n\n# Now you can work with the JSON data\nprint(json_data)\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `'(myapikey)'` with your actual API key. Also, the Sunlight Foundation's API might have been deprecated or moved, as it was originally part of their open government initiative. Ensure that the URL you're using is still valid and that you have a valid API key if required.\n\nAdditionally, when handling API keys in your code, it's a good practice to store them securely, such as in environment variables or configuration files, rather than hardcoding them directly into your code."
