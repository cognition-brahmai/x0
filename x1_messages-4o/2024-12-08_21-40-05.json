        "content": "The code you've provided should work correctly for sorting the list of words in alphabetical order. However, if you're encountering an error, it might be due to something else in your environment. Let's go through the code again to ensure everything is correct:\n\n```python\n# List of words to be sorted\nwords = [\"back\", \"run\", \"blue\", \"tried\"]\n\n# Sorting the list of words\nsorted_words = sorted(words)\n\n# Printing the sorted list\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nThis code does the following:\n- Declares a list `words` containing the strings \"back\", \"run\", \"blue\", and \"tried\".\n- Uses the `sorted()` function to sort the list alphabetically and stores the result in `sorted_words`.\n- Prints the sorted list.\n\nIf you're still experiencing an error, consider the following troubleshooting steps:\n1. Ensure you are using a compatible version of Python (Python 3 is recommended).\n2. Check for any syntax errors or typos in the code when you type it out.\n3. Make sure there are no conflicting variable names or imported modules in your environment.\n4. If you're using an IDE or text editor, ensure it's configured correctly for Python.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, please provide the specific error message you're encountering, and I'll be happy to help further!"
