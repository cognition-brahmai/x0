In SQL, I would use the command \"select category_id, count(id) from item group by category_id\". Is there a Django equivalent for this or is raw SQL the only option? I am familiar with the count() method in Django, but I don't understand how to incorporate group by into this.\n\nHere are the code examples for my 'Category' and 'Item' models:\n\n```python\nclass Category(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=60)\n\nclass Item(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=60)\n    category = models.ForeignKey(Category)\n```"

You can annotate each `Category` with the count of related `Item` objects. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\nFirst, make sure to import `Count`:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db.models import Count\n```\n\nThen, you can annotate your `Category` queryset like this:\n\n```python\ncategories_with_item_count = Category.objects.annotate(item_count=Count('item'))\n```\n\nThis will give you a queryset of `Category` objects, where each object has an additional attribute `item_count`, representing the number of `Item` objects associated with that category.\n\nYou can then iterate over this queryset to access each category and its corresponding item count:\n\n```python\nfor category in categories_with_item_count:\n    print(f\"Category: {category.name}, Item Count: {category.item_count}\")\n```\n\nThis approach uses Django's ORM capabilities to perform the equivalent of a SQL `GROUP BY` and `COUNT` operation, and it's efficient and easy to integrate into your Django application."
