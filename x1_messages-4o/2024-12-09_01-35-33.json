I attempted to access 'coef_' with the code 'sgd_randomized_pipe.best_estimator_.coef_', but it resulted in the following error: 'AttributeError: 'Pipeline' object has no attribute 'coef_''. The scikit-learn documentation states that 'coef_' is an attribute of 'SGDClassifier', which is the class of my 'base_estimator_'. Where am I going wrong with this?\n\nHere's the code I've used:\n\n```python\npipe_sgd = Pipeline([('scl', StandardScaler()),\n                    ('clf', SGDClassifier(n_jobs=-1))])\n\nparam_dist_sgd = {'clf__loss': ['log'],\n                 'clf__penalty': [None, 'l1', 'l2', 'elasticnet'],\n                 'clf__alpha': np.linspace(0.15, 0.35),\n                 'clf__n_iter': [3, 5, 7]}\n\nsgd_randomized_pipe = RandomizedSearchCV(estimator = pipe_sgd, \n                                         param_distributions=param_dist_sgd, \n                                         cv=3, n_iter=30, n_jobs=-1)\n\nsgd_randomized_pipe.fit(X_train, y_train)\n```\n\nI am trying to access the 'coef_' attribute with the following line of code:\n\n```python\nsgd_randomized_pipe.best_estimator_.coef_\n```\n\nHowever, it results in the below error: \n\n'AttributeError: 'Pipeline' object has no attribute 'coef_''"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is because you are trying to access the `coef_` attribute directly from the `Pipeline` object returned by `best_estimator_` in `RandomizedSearchCV`. The `Pipeline` itself doesn't have a `coef_` attribute, but rather the `SGDClassifier` inside the `Pipeline` does.\n\nTo access the `coef_` attribute of the `SGDClassifier` within the `Pipeline`, you need to access the specific step of the `Pipeline` that contains the classifier. In your case, the `SGDClassifier` is the second step in your `Pipeline` with the name `'clf'`.\n\nHere's how you can access the `coef_` attribute correctly:\n\n```python\n# Access the best estimator from RandomizedSearchCV\nbest_pipeline = sgd_randomized_pipe.best_estimator_\n\n# Access the 'SGDClassifier' from the pipeline\nbest_sgd_classifier = best_pipeline.named_steps['clf']\n\n# Now, access the 'coef_' attribute from the 'SGDClassifier'\nsgd_coef = best_sgd_classifier.coef_\n\n# Output the coefficients\nprint(sgd_coef)\n```\n\nThis code first retrieves the best pipeline from the `RandomizedSearchCV`. Then, it accesses the `SGDClassifier` step using `named_steps['clf']`, and finally, it accesses the `coef_` attribute from the `SGDClassifier`. This should resolve the error and provide you with the coefficients of your fitted model."
