        "content": "What is a fast method, using bash and basic Linux binaries, to find lines in one file (file1) that are not present in another file (file2)? I have two large files of roughly 30,000 lines each, and my current solution using grep is very slow. For example, if file1 contains the lines \"line1\", \"line2\", and \"line3\" and file2 contains the lines \"line1\", \"line4\", and \"line5\", my output should be \"line2\" and \"line3\". My current solution is \"grep -v -f file2 file1\". I think there might be a way to do this using diff(), but I want the output to contain only the lines that differ, nothing else, and I can't find a switch for that. The best solution I've found so far with diff() is \"diff file2 file1 | grep '^>' | sed 's/^>\\\\ //'. Is there a better way?"

        "content": "To efficiently find lines in `file1` that are not present in `file2`, you can use a combination of `sort`, `uniq`, and `comm`. This method should be faster than using `grep`, especially for larger files. Here\u2019s a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Sort both files**: Sorting the files is crucial as it allows `comm` to compare them efficiently.\n\n2. **Use `comm`**: This command compares two sorted files line by line.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```bash\nsort file1 > sorted_file1\nsort file2 > sorted_file2\ncomm -23 sorted_file1 sorted_file2\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `sort file1 > sorted_file1`: Sorts `file1` and saves the output to `sorted_file1`.\n- `sort file2 > sorted_file2`: Sorts `file2` and saves the output to `sorted_file2`.\n- `comm -23 sorted_file1 sorted_file2`: \n  - `comm` compares the sorted files.\n  - `-2` suppresses lines unique to `sorted_file2`.\n  - `-3` suppresses lines that are common to both files.\n  - Thus, only lines unique to `sorted_file1` (i.e., lines in `file1` not in `file2`) are output.\n\nThis method is efficient and should work well for files with around 30,000 lines."
