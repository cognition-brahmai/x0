I have a 1D data array and want to extract three portions from it in this manner:\n\n```python\ndata_extractions = []\n\nfor start_index in range(0, 3):\n    data_extractions.append(data[start_index: start_index + 5])\n```\n\nThis results in `data_extractions` being:\n\n```python\ndata_extractions = [\n    data[0:5],\n    data[1:6],\n    data[2:7]\n]\n```\n\nI want to achieve this without using a for loop. Is there an indexing scheme in numpy that would let me select multiple slices from an array and return them as that many arrays, maybe in an n+1 dimensional array?\n\nI attempted to replicate my data and then select a span from each row, however, this code gives me an IndexError:\n\n```python\nreplicated_data = np.vstack([data] * 3)\ndata_extractions = replicated_data[[range(3)], [slice(0, 5), slice(1, 6), slice(2, 7)]\n```"

        "content": "To achieve this without using a for loop, you can make use of NumPy's advanced indexing and broadcasting features. Here's how you can do it:\n\nYou can create an array of indices that represents the starting points of the slices you want to extract. Then, you can use broadcasting to create an array of all the indices you need, and use that to index into your data array.\n\nHere's the code that does this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Example data array\ndata = np.arange(10)  # Let's say your data array is [0, 1, 2, ..., 9]\n\n# Define the starting indices of the slices you want\nstart_indices = np.arange(3)\n\n# Define the length of each slice\nslice_length = 5\n\n# Create a 2D array of indices for slicing\nindices = start_indices[:, np.newaxis] + np.arange(slice_length)\n\n# Use advanced indexing to get the slices\ndata_extractions = data[indices]\n\nprint(data_extractions)\n```\n\nHere's what happens in this code:\n\n1. `start_indices` is an array `[0, 1, 2]` representing the starting points of the slices.\n2. `np.arange(slice_length)` creates an array `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, representing the relative indices within each slice.\n3. `indices` is a 2D array created by broadcasting `start_indices` with the slice range, resulting in an array where each row contains the indices for one slice.\n4. `data[indices]` uses advanced indexing to extract the slices, resulting in a 2D array where each row is one of the slices you wanted.\n\nThis method efficiently extracts the desired slices without explicitly looping through them."
