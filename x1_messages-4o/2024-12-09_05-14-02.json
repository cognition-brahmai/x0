However, when I attempt to run the program, I encounter an error saying, \"ImportError: libcblas.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory.\" Could anyone provide guidance on how to resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The error message you are encountering suggests that the program is trying to load a shared library file, `libcblas.so.3`, which is part of the BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) library used for performing basic vector and matrix operations. This library is not currently installed on your Raspberry Pi, which is why the error occurs.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can install the necessary library by following these steps:\n\n1. **Update your package list** to ensure you have the latest information about available packages:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   ```\n\n2. **Install the BLAS library**. The package you need to install is called `libatlas-base-dev`, which contains the BLAS and LAPACK libraries:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify the installation** by checking if the library file is present:\n   ```bash\n   ls /usr/lib/ | grep libcblas\n   ```\n\n4. **Re-run your program** to check if the issue is resolved.\n\nIf you continue to encounter issues, make sure that all dependencies for your computer vision software are correctly installed, and consider reinstalling or updating the software to ensure compatibility with the libraries on your system."
