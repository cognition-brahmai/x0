However, you can create a new string by concatenating slices of the original string along with the new value you want to insert. Here's how you can insert a \"-\" at position 4 in the string \"3655879ACB6\":\n\n```python\noriginal_string = \"3655879ACB6\"\nposition = 4\nvalue_to_insert = \"-\"\n\n# Create a new string with the value inserted at the specified position\nnew_string = original_string[:position] + value_to_insert + original_string[position:]\n\nprint(new_string)\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n\n```\n3655-879ACB6\n```\n\nHere's what's happening in the code:\n- `original_string[:position]` takes the substring from the start of the original string up to, but not including, the specified position.\n- `value_to_insert` is the string you want to insert.\n- `original_string[position:]` takes the substring from the specified position to the end of the original string.\n- By concatenating these parts together, you get a new string with the value inserted at the desired position."
