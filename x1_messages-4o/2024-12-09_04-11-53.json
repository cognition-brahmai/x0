        "content": "I'm encountering a problem with PyTorch where I'm getting a \"multi-target not supported\" error message when I attempt to classify some (3, 50, 50) pictures. Initially, I loaded the dataset from the file without a dataloader or batches and it worked fine. But after adding both of these, I get the following error: \n\n```RuntimeError: multi-target not supported at /pytorch/aten/src/THCUNN/generic/ClassNLLCriterion.cu:15```\n\nI've tried using `target.squeeze(1)` as suggested in numerous online sources, but it doesn't work for me. My target-batch looks like this:\n\n```tensor([[1, 0],\n        [1, 0],\n        [1, 0],\n        [1, 0],\n        [1, 0],\n        [1, 0],\n        [1, 0],\n        [1, 0]], device='cuda:0')```\n\nI'm currently only creating the structure of the model and plan to apply the full and correct dataset later, as I don't have all the data yet. I only have 32 pictures and no labels, so I added `torch.tensor([1, 0])` as a placeholder for all labels. But when I attempt to train my model, the aforementioned error occurs. How can I resolve this?"

        "content": "The \"multi-target not supported\" error you're encountering in PyTorch is typically related to the use of a loss function that expects a single class label per sample, such as `nn.CrossEntropyLoss`, but you're providing labels in a one-hot encoded format (e.g., `[1, 0]`). Here\u2019s how you can resolve this issue:\n\n### Understanding the Issue\n\n1. **Loss Function**: `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` expects class indices as targets, not one-hot encoded vectors. In your case, it expects a single integer for each sample, indicating the class index.\n\n2. **Target Format**: Your targets are currently in a one-hot encoded format (`[1, 0]`). This format is generally used when dealing with multi-label classification tasks or when using a different loss function like `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss` for binary classification.\n\n### Solutions\n\nHere are a few ways you can resolve the issue:\n\n#### Option 1: Use Class Indices with `nn.CrossEntropyLoss`\n\nIf you are indeed performing single-label classification, convert your one-hot encoded targets to class indices:\n\n```python\n# Convert one-hot encoded targets to class indices\ntarget_classes = target.argmax(dim=1)\n\n# Use nn.CrossEntropyLoss\ncriterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()\nloss = criterion(output, target_classes)\n```\n\n#### Option 2: Use `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss` for Binary Classification\n\nIf you are performing binary classification and prefer to keep one-hot encoded targets, you can switch to `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss`:\n\n```python\n# Use nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss for binary classification\ncriterion = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()\nloss = criterion(output, target.float())\n```\n\nEnsure that your model's output has the correct shape (e.g., a single output unit per class) and that you are not applying a softmax activation before the loss function, as `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss` expects raw logits.\n\n### Adjusting the Model\n\nMake sure your model\u2019s output layer matches the shape required by the loss function you choose. For binary classification with `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss`, typically, you\u2019d have one output unit per class.\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n- **Verify Output Shape**: Ensure your model output and target shapes match what the loss function expects.\n- **Check Data Loading**: Double-check your DataLoader implementation to ensure it\u2019s correctly batching data and targets.\n- **Use Placeholder Labels Correctly**: Remember to replace placeholder labels with actual labels once they are available.\n\nWith these adjustments, you should be able to resolve the \"multi-target not supported\" error and proceed with training your model successfully."
