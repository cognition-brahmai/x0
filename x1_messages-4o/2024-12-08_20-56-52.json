        "content": "Certainly! Here are three lesser-known tools that are often used by woodworking enthusiasts:\n\n1. **Spokeshave**: This tool is used for shaping and smoothing wooden rods and shafts, such as those used in chair legs and curved surfaces. It's particularly handy for fine-tuning and refining shapes that are difficult to achieve with other tools.\n\n2. **Card Scraper**: Often overlooked, a card scraper is a simple yet effective tool for smoothing wood surfaces and removing small amounts of material. It can be used to eliminate tear-out and achieve a very smooth finish, especially on tricky grain patterns.\n\n3. **Scratch Stock**: This is a versatile tool used to create custom profiles and moldings. It consists of a handle with a blade that can be shaped to the desired profile. It's particularly useful for adding unique decorative details to woodworking projects."
