        "content": "The difference between `ugettext` and `ugettext_lazy` primarily lies in when the translation is performed in the context of Django's internationalization (i18n) framework.\n\n1. **`ugettext`**: This function translates the string immediately when it is called. It is used when you need the translation to occur at runtime. This is why when you use `return HttpResponse(ugettext(\"Hello\"))`, it works as expected because the string \"Hello\" is translated immediately and then passed to `HttpResponse`.\n\n2. **`ugettext_lazy`**: This function, on the other hand, returns a lazy translation object that will be translated when the string is actually used in the context of a template or when it's explicitly converted to a string. This is beneficial when you want to delay the translation, for instance, when defining model fields or forms that will be instantiated multiple times. \n\nThe behavior you're observing is because `ugettext_lazy` does not immediately convert the string to the translated version. Instead, it returns a lazy object that acts like a string but isn't converted until necessary. When you directly pass this lazy object to `HttpResponse`, it doesn't automatically convert it to a string, hence you see no output.\n\nTo fix this, you can explicitly convert the lazy translation to a string before passing it to `HttpResponse`:\n\n```python\nfrom django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _\n\ndef my_view(request):\n    return HttpResponse(str(_(\"Hello\")))\n```\n\nThis ensures that the lazy translation object is converted to a string, and you'll get the expected output in your HTTP response."
