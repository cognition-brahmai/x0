        "content": "To define a tuple representation of a custom class object in Python, you can create a method that explicitly returns a tuple representing the object's attributes. This isn't done by overriding a special method like `__str__`, but rather by defining a custom method. \n\nHere's how you can modify your `Point` class to include a method that returns a tuple representation:\n\n```python\nclass Point():\n    def __init__(self, x, y):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return '{}, {}'.format(self.x, self.y)\n\n    def to_tuple(self):\n        return (self.x, self.y)\n\n# Usage\na = Point(1, 1)\nb = str(a)\nprint('String representation:', b)\n\nc = a.to_tuple()\nprint('Tuple representation:', c)\n```\n\nIn this code, the `to_tuple` method is added to the `Point` class. When you call `a.to_tuple()`, it will return the tuple `(1, 1)`, representing the `x` and `y` attributes of the `Point` object. This approach gives you flexibility in defining how the object should be represented as a tuple."
