        "content": "To validate an IP address in Python, you can use the `ipaddress` module, which is built into Python's standard library. This module provides a straightforward way to handle both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Here's how you can use it to validate an IP address input by a user:\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef validate_ip_address(ip_str):\n    try:\n        # Attempt to create an IP address object from the string\n        ip = ipaddress.ip_address(ip_str)\n        return True\n    except ValueError:\n        # If a ValueError is raised, the string is not a valid IP address\n        return False\n\n# Example usage\nuser_input = \"192.168.1.1\"  # Replace with input from user\nif validate_ip_address(user_input):\n    print(f\"{user_input} is a valid IP address.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"{user_input} is not a valid IP address.\")\n```\n\nThis function attempts to create an `ip_address` object from the input string. If the string is a valid IP address, the function returns `True`. If the string is not a valid IP address, a `ValueError` is raised, and the function returns `False`. This method works for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses."
