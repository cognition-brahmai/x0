However, when I try to import Django in Python, I am getting an error \"ImportError: No module named django\". The version of pip seems to be associated with Python 2.7, and the Django module is listed when I run pip freeze. When I check the Python sys.path, there doesn't seem to be any Django-related entries. Why am I unable to import Django despite it being installed?\n\nHere is the error and relevant terminal outputs:\n\n```bash\n$ pip freeze\nDjango==1.6.11\n$ pip --version\npip 1.5.4 from /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (python 2.7)\n$ python\nPython 2.7.9 (default, Feb  3 2016, 02:50:32) \n[GCC 4.8.4] on linux2\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>>import django\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nImportError: No module named django\n>>> import sys\n>>> sys.path\n['', '/usr/local/lib/python27.zip', '/usr/local/lib/python2.7', '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/plat-linux2', '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/lib-tk', '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/lib-old', '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload', '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages']\n>>> \n```"

        "content": "The issue you're facing seems to be related to the Python environment and where Django is installed. Let's go through a few steps to resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Check Python Version**:\n   Make sure you are using the correct version of Python when trying to import Django. Since Django is installed for Python 2.7, ensure you're running Python 2.7 when you try to import Django.\n\n   You can explicitly call Python 2.7 using:\n   ```bash\n   python2.7\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify Django Installation**:\n   Ensure Django is installed in the correct Python environment. You can do this by checking the site-packages directory for Python 2.7:\n   ```bash\n   ls /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages\n   ```\n   Look for a Django package or Django-related files.\n\n3. **Python Path**:\n   Make sure the path to Django is included in your `sys.path`. If Django is installed elsewhere, you may need to adjust your `PYTHONPATH` or modify `sys.path` at runtime by adding the following lines before importing Django:\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   sys.path.append('/path/to/django/directory')\n   ```\n\n4. **Reinstall Django**:\n   Sometimes, reinstalling can resolve such issues. You can uninstall and reinstall Django using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall django\n   pip install django\n   ```\n\n5. **Use Virtual Environments**:\n   Consider using virtual environments to manage Python dependencies. This will help you isolate your packages for different projects and avoid conflicts between Python versions. Here's a quick setup guide:\n   ```bash\n   # Install virtualenv if not already installed\n   pip install virtualenv\n\n   # Create a virtual environment\n   virtualenv myenv --python=python2.7\n\n   # Activate the virtual environment\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n\n   # Install Django within the virtual environment\n   pip install django\n\n   # Now try to import Django\n   python\n   >>> import django\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the import error and successfully use Django. If you still encounter issues, verify each step carefully to ensure everything is set up correctly."
