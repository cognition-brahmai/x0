However, when I attempt to multiply the sales amount by the sales tax, I get a TypeError: \"can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'float'\". Here's my code:\n\n```python\nsalesAmount = raw_input ([\"Insert sale amount here \\n\"])\n['Insert sale amount here \\n']20.99\n>>> salesTax = 0.08\n>>> totalAmount = salesAmount * salesTax\n```\n\nAnd here's the error message:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<pyshell#57>\", line 1, in <module>\n    totalAmount = salesAmount * salesTax\nTypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'float'\n```\n\nCan anyone help me understand what might be causing this issue and how to fix it?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the `raw_input()` function (or `input()` in Python 3) returns a string, and you cannot directly multiply a string by a float. To fix this, you need to convert the input string to a float before performing the multiplication. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\n# For Python 2.x\nsalesAmount = raw_input(\"Insert sale amount here \\n\")\nsalesAmount = float(salesAmount)  # Convert the input to a float\nsalesTax = 0.08\ntotalAmount = salesAmount * salesTax\nprint(\"Total amount including sales tax: \", totalAmount)\n```\n\nIf you're using Python 3, you should replace `raw_input()` with `input()`:\n\n```python\n# For Python 3.x\nsalesAmount = input(\"Insert sale amount here \\n\")\nsalesAmount = float(salesAmount)  # Convert the input to a float\nsalesTax = 0.08\ntotalAmount = salesAmount * salesTax\nprint(\"Total amount including sales tax: \", totalAmount)\n```\n\nThis will ensure that the sales amount is treated as a numerical value, allowing you to perform arithmetic operations with it."
