I have successfully trained the network and printed out its accuracy, but I am struggling to use the neural network to make a prediction. I believe the issue lies in formatting my input string to match the model's expectations. Here is the specific line causing trouble:\n\n```python\nfeatures = get_features_for_input(\"This was the best store i've ever seen.\")\nresult = (sess.run(tf.argmax(prediction.eval(feed_dict={x:features}),1)))\n```\n\nAnd here is a larger section of the code for context:\n\n```python\ndef train_neural_network(x):\n    prediction = neural_network_model(x)\n    cost = tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits=prediction, labels=y)) \n    optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer().minimize(cost)\n\n    with tf.Session() as sess:\n        sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())\n\n        for epoch in range(hm_epochs):\n            epoch_loss = 0\n            i = 0\n            while i < len(train_x):\n                start = i\n                end = i + batch_size\n\n                batch_x = np.array(train_x[start:end])\n                batch_y = np.array(train_y[start:end])\n\n                _, c = sess.run([optimizer, cost], feed_dict={x: batch_x, y: batch_y})\n                epoch_loss += c \n                i+=batch_size\n\n            print('Epoch', epoch, 'completed out of', hm_epochs, 'loss:', epoch_loss)\n\n        correct = tf.equal(tf.argmax(prediction, 1), tf.argmax(y,1))        \n        accuracy = tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(correct,'float'))\n        print('Accuracy', accuracy.eval({x:test_x, y:test_y}))\n\n        # pos: [1,0] , argmax: 0\n        # neg: [0,1] , argmax: 1\n        features = get_features_for_input(\"This was the best store i've ever seen.\")\n        result = (sess.run(tf.argmax(prediction.eval(feed_dict={x:features}),1)))\n        if result[0] == 0:\n            print('Positive:',input_data)\n        elif result[0] == 1:\n            print('Negative:',input_data)\n\ndef get_features_for_input(input):\n    current_words = word_tokenize(input.lower())\n    current_words = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(i) for i in current_words]\n    features = np.zeros(len(lexicon))\n\n    for word in current_words:\n        if word.lower() in lexicon:\n            index_value = lexicon.index(word.lower())\n            # OR DO +=1, test both\n            features[index_value] += 1\n\n    features = np.array(list(features))\n\ntrain_neural_network(x)\n```\n\nPlease help me figure out how to correctly use the neural network to make a prediction."

        "content": "To make predictions with your trained neural network, you need to ensure that the input string is properly processed and formatted to match the input shape expected by the network. It looks like you have a function `get_features_for_input` that converts an input string into a feature vector based on a lexicon. Here's what you should check and adjust in your code:\n\n1. **Ensure `get_features_for_input` returns a 2D array**: Neural networks in TensorFlow typically expect inputs as batches, even if you are only passing a single example. You need to reshape your feature array to be 2D.\n\n2. **Verify the lexicon and input processing**: Make sure your `lexicon` contains all the words you expect to process and that `get_features_for_input` correctly tokenizes and lemmatizes the input.\n\n3. **Modify the prediction call**: Ensure the input to the TensorFlow session is correctly formatted.\n\nHere's an updated version of the relevant part of your code with these considerations:\n\n```python\ndef get_features_for_input(input):\n    current_words = word_tokenize(input.lower())\n    current_words = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(i) for i in current_words]\n    features = np.zeros(len(lexicon))\n\n    for word in current_words:\n        if word.lower() in lexicon:\n            index_value = lexicon.index(word.lower())\n            features[index_value] += 1\n\n    # Reshape to 2D array for batch processing\n    return np.array(features).reshape(1, -1)\n\nwith tf.Session() as sess:\n    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())\n    # Assume training is performed here as in your original code\n\n    # Making a prediction\n    features = get_features_for_input(\"This was the best store I've ever seen.\")\n    prediction_output = sess.run(tf.argmax(prediction, 1), feed_dict={x: features})\n\n    if prediction_output[0] == 0:\n        print('Positive:', \"This was the best store I've ever seen.\")\n    elif prediction_output[0] == 1:\n        print('Negative:', \"This was the best store I've ever seen.\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Reshape Input**: Ensure that `features` is a 2D array with shape `(1, len(lexicon))` since TensorFlow expects inputs to be batches.\n- **Correct Session Usage**: Use `sess.run()` with `feed_dict` directly to evaluate the prediction.\n- **Initialization**: Make sure the session is properly initialized with `sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())` before making predictions.\n- **Consistency in String Handling**: Ensure the string you print matches the one you processed, as in the example above.\n\nBy following these adjustments, your neural network should be able to make predictions on individual input strings properly."
