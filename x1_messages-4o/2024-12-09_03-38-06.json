        "content": "The error message you're encountering, `socket.error: [Errno 98] Address already in use`, indicates that the port your application is trying to bind to is already being used by another process. Here are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Identify the Process Using the Port:**\n   You can use the following command to identify the process that is using the port. Replace `PORT_NUMBER` with the actual port number your application is trying to use.\n\n   ```bash\n   lsof -i :PORT_NUMBER\n   ```\n\n   This will display a list of processes using the specified port. Look for the `PID` (Process ID) of the process and note it down.\n\n2. **Stop the Conflicting Process:**\n   If you find that another instance of your application or another service is using the port, you can stop it using the `kill` command. Replace `PID` with the actual Process ID you noted earlier.\n\n   ```bash\n   kill -9 PID\n   ```\n\n   Be careful while using `kill -9` as it forcefully stops the process without allowing it to clean up.\n\n3. **Change the Port Number:**\n   If you don't want to stop the other process or if it's a necessary service, consider changing the port number your application is using. You can do this by modifying the configuration or code where the port number is set.\n\n4. **Check for Zombie Processes:**\n   Sometimes, processes might not terminate properly and could leave behind \"zombie\" processes that hold onto the port. You can check for these using:\n\n   ```bash\n   ps -aux | grep application.py\n   ```\n\n   Identify and kill any zombie processes.\n\n5. **Use `SO_REUSEADDR` Option:**\n   If you anticipate needing to restart your application frequently, consider setting the `SO_REUSEADDR` socket option in your application to allow reuse of the address. This can be done by modifying your server setup code:\n\n   ```python\n   import socket\n   server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n   server_socket.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)\n   ```\n\n6. **Restart Your System:**\n   If all else fails, a system reboot can clear out lingering processes and free up the port.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"Address already in use\" error and successfully run your Python application."
