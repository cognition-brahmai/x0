I've tried setting the graph level seed, the numpy random seed, and operation level seeds but it hasn't helped. I've found that the reduce_sum function might be causing the issue due to its non-deterministic property on GPU, even after setting the seeds. Since I'm working on a project for a publication, having reproducible results is crucial. Is there an alternative function I can use? Additionally, I've been advised to use CPU, but that's not an option for me due to the large data sets I'm working with. How do others working on complex projects using Tensorflow handle this problem? Alternatively, would it be acceptable to reviewers if I load the saved model checkpoint file for result verification?"

        "content": "Reproducing results consistently in TensorFlow, especially when working with GPUs, can indeed be challenging due to non-deterministic operations. Here are some strategies and considerations you might find useful:\n\n1. **Use Deterministic Operations**: While TensorFlow GPU operations can be non-deterministic, TensorFlow has been making strides in providing deterministic alternatives. You can try setting the environment variable `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS=1` to enforce deterministic behavior for supported operations. However, this might not cover all operations.\n\n2. **Alternative to `reduce_sum`**: If `reduce_sum` is causing non-determinism, you might consider breaking down your operations into smaller, simpler steps that are inherently deterministic. However, there isn't a straightforward drop-in replacement for `reduce_sum` that guarantees determinism on GPUs. \n\n3. **Check TensorFlow Version**: Make sure you're using the latest version of TensorFlow, as improvements and bug fixes are continuously being made that could impact determinism.\n\n4. **Model Checkpoints**: Saving and loading model checkpoints is a common practice for ensuring reproducibility. As long as you document this process clearly in your publication, reviewers typically accept it. It demonstrates that your results can be reproduced from a specific state of the model.\n\n5. **Mixed Precision and Performance**: If performance is a concern and you're unable to use the CPU due to dataset size, consider using mixed precision training. This can offer performance improvements on the GPU while maintaining numerical stability.\n\n6. **Collaborate with Others**: Reach out to the TensorFlow community or forums. Many developers and researchers face similar issues, and sharing solutions can be beneficial.\n\n7. **Document Your Environment**: Make sure to document the exact environment setup, including TensorFlow version, hardware specifications, and any relevant environment variables. This helps others (and reviewers) understand the context of your results.\n\nBy addressing these considerations and clearly explaining your methodology in your publication, you should be able to justify your approach to reviewers. Reproducibility in machine learning is a recognized challenge, and providing transparency in your process can help mitigate concerns."
