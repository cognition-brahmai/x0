        "content": "For extracting text from PDF files using Python 3.4, you have a few options. Even though some libraries might primarily support newer versions of Python, there are still a couple of libraries you can try that should be compatible with Python 3.4:\n\n1. **PyPDF2**: This is a pure Python library that can read PDF files and extract text. It's relatively easy to use, though it may not work perfectly for all PDFs, especially those with complex layouts.\n\n   Installation:\n   ```bash\n   pip install PyPDF2\n   ```\n\n   Basic usage:\n   ```python\n   import PyPDF2\n\n   with open('example.pdf', 'rb') as file:\n       reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)\n       text = \"\"\n\n       for page in reader.pages:\n           text += page.extract_text()\n\n   print(text)\n   ```\n\n2. **PDFMiner**: Although PDFMiner's newer versions are more suited for Python 3.6 and above, you could try using an older version compatible with Python 3.4. PDFMiner is more robust and better at handling complex PDF files.\n\n   Installation:\n   ```bash\n   pip install pdfminer.six==20181108\n   ```\n\n   Basic usage:\n   ```python\n   from pdfminer.high_level import extract_text\n\n   text = extract_text('example.pdf')\n   print(text)\n   ```\n\n3. **Slate**: Slate is a wrapper around PDFMiner, specifically designed to extract text from PDFs. It might be easier to use if you find PDFMiner's API a bit complex.\n\n   Installation:\n   ```bash\n   pip install slate\n   ```\n\n   Basic usage:\n   ```python\n   import slate\n\n   with open('example.pdf', 'rb') as file:\n       extracted_text = slate.PDF(file)\n\n   for page in extracted_text:\n       print(page)\n   ```\n\nMake sure to test these libraries with your specific PDF files, as the success of text extraction can depend on the PDF's structure and content."
