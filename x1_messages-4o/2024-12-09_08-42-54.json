My current code doesn't include this grid which I would like to superimpose on the plot. My code is:\n\n```python\nx = numpy.arange(0, 1, 0.05)\ny = numpy.power(x, 2)\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.gca()\nax.set_xticks(numpy.arange(0, 1, 0.1))\nax.set_yticks(numpy.arange(0, 1., 0.1))\nplt.scatter(x, y)\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThe output from this code is a scatter plot without a grid. How can I modify it to include a 10x10 grid as shown in the example image?"

        "content": "To add a 10x10 grid to your scatter plot, you can use the `grid` method in matplotlib to enable the grid lines on your plot. Here's how you can modify your existing code to include a grid:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Create data\nx = np.arange(0, 1, 0.05)\ny = np.power(x, 2)\n\n# Create a figure and axis\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Plot the scatter\nax.scatter(x, y)\n\n# Set ticks for a 10x10 grid\nax.set_xticks(np.arange(0, 1.1, 0.1))\nax.set_yticks(np.arange(0, 1.1, 0.1))\n\n# Enable the grid\nax.grid(True)\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nMake sure to import `numpy` as `np` and `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt` at the beginning of your script. This code will create a 10x10 grid on your scatter plot by setting the tick marks at intervals of 0.1 on both axes and enabling the grid lines."
