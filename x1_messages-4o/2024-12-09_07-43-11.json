Instead, its performance is affected by coalescing.\n  - Global memory accesses are optimized when they are coalesced, meaning that threads in a warp should access memory in a pattern that allows the hardware to combine these into a single transaction.\n  - Uncoalesced accesses result in multiple memory transactions, reducing performance, but this is not termed as a bank conflict.\n\n### Registers:\n\n- **Registers:**\n  - Registers are private to each thread, so there is no concept of bank conflicts with registers.\n  - The main concern with registers is register spilling, where excessive use of registers causes some to be stored in local memory, which is significantly slower.\n\nIn summary, bank conflicts specifically refer to shared memory access patterns, not global memory or registers. Global memory efficiency is primarily about memory access coalescing, and registers are about managing usage to prevent spilling. Properly managing these aspects is key to achieving high performance in CUDA and OpenCL programming."
