        "content": "In Objective-C, when working with `NSString` to achieve similar functionality as Python's `string.startswith()` and `string.endswith()`, you can use the following methods:\n\n1. **Checking if a string starts with a specific substring:**\n\n   You can use the `hasPrefix:` method for this purpose. This method checks if the string begins with the specified prefix.\n\n   ```objc\n   NSString *myString = @\"Hello, World!\";\n   BOOL startsWithHello = [myString hasPrefix:@\"Hello\"];\n   if (startsWithHello) {\n       NSLog(@\"The string starts with 'Hello'\");\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Checking if a string ends with a specific substring:**\n\n   For checking if a string ends with a particular suffix, you can use the `hasSuffix:` method.\n\n   ```objc\n   NSString *myString = @\"Hello, World!\";\n   BOOL endsWithWorld = [myString hasSuffix:@\"World!\"];\n   if (endsWithWorld) {\n       NSLog(@\"The string ends with 'World!'\");\n   }\n   ```\n\nThese methods are part of the `NSString` class in Cocoa and provide a straightforward way to check for prefixes and suffixes in strings, similar to Python's `startswith()` and `endswith()` functions."
