Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using the column position:** If the unnamed column is the first one, you can use its index position, which is `0`.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming 'data' is your DataFrame\ndata = pd.read_csv('your_file.csv')\n\n# Rename the first column using its index\ndata.rename(columns={data.columns[0]: 'new_column_name'}, inplace=True)\n```\n\n2. **Using the column name as an empty string:** If the column is specifically represented with an empty string as its name, you can rename it directly.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming 'data' is your DataFrame\ndata = pd.read_csv('your_file.csv')\n\n# Rename the unnamed column\ndata.rename(columns={'': 'new_column_name'}, inplace=True)\n```\n\nYou can choose either method depending on how the unnamed column is represented in your DataFrame."
