I want to generate an automatic version number based on git tags for both 'setup.py sdist' and similar commands, and for the library itself. While I can use 'git describe' or similar solutions for the first task, the problem arises when I want to have this version number available for the library itself, to send it in the User-Agent HTTP header as 'mylib/0.1-3-adcd'. If I add a 'setup.py version' command, then this version.py is generated after the tag is made, since it uses the tag as a value. This requires making one more commit after the version tag is made to make the code consistent, which in turn requires a new tag for further bundling. How do I break this cycle of dependencies (generate-commit-tag-generate-commit-tag-...)?"

        "content": "To avoid the cycle of dependencies you're experiencing with generating version numbers from Git tags and incorporating them both in your `setup.py` and within your library, you can use a dynamic approach to retrieve the version information directly from the Git repository at runtime. This eliminates the need for additional commits solely for version number updates. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Use `setuptools_scm`**: This package is specifically designed to handle version numbers based on your Git tags without requiring manual updates in your codebase.\n\n2. **Setup `setuptools_scm`**:\n   - First, install `setuptools_scm` using pip:\n\n     ```bash\n     pip install setuptools_scm\n     ```\n\n   - Modify your `setup.py` to use `setuptools_scm` for versioning:\n\n     ```python\n     from setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\n     setup(\n         name='mylib',\n         use_scm_version=True,\n         setup_requires=['setuptools_scm'],\n         packages=find_packages(),\n         # Other parameters...\n     )\n     ```\n\n3. **Access the version in your library**:\n   To make the version accessible within your library, you can use `setuptools_scm` to dynamically retrieve it. Add the following to your library's `__init__.py` or wherever appropriate:\n\n   ```python\n   try:\n       from setuptools_scm import get_version\n       __version__ = get_version(root='..', relative_to=__file__)\n   except ImportError:\n       __version__ = '0.0.0'\n   ```\n\n   This code attempts to retrieve the version using `get_version`. If `setuptools_scm` isn't available, it defaults to `'0.0.0'`, which you can adjust as necessary.\n\n4. **User-Agent Header**:\n   Whenever you need to use the version number in your HTTP requests, you can simply refer to `__version__`:\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n\n   headers = {\n       'User-Agent': f'mylib/{__version__}'\n   }\n\n   response = requests.get('https://example.com', headers=headers)\n   ```\n\nThis approach allows you to automatically generate version numbers based on your latest Git tags without needing extra commits or manual updates. The version number is determined at runtime, ensuring consistency between your package metadata and your library's runtime behavior."
