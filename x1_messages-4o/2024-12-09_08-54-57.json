Here's a comprehensive guide to help you set it up:\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment\n\n1. **Choose a Server**: First, decide which server technology you'll use. Common choices include Node.js with Express and Apollo Server, or Python with Graphene, among others.\n\n2. **Install Necessary Packages**: For a Node.js environment using Apollo Server, you might install packages like:\n   ```bash\n   npm init -y\n   npm install apollo-server graphql\n   ```\n\n### Step 2: Define Your GraphQL Schema\n\n1. **Create a Schema File**: Define the types and queries your API will support. For a movie search by title, you might have something like this:\n\n   ```graphql\n   type Movie {\n     id: ID!\n     title: String!\n     director: String\n     releaseDate: String\n     genre: String\n   }\n\n   type Query {\n     searchMoviesByTitle(title: String!): [Movie]\n   }\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Implement Resolvers\n\n1. **Create Resolvers**: Resolvers are functions that handle fetching the data for each field in your schema. Here\u2019s an example of how you might implement a resolver for the `searchMoviesByTitle` query:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const movies = [\n     { id: '1', title: 'Inception', director: 'Christopher Nolan', releaseDate: '2010', genre: 'Sci-Fi' },\n     { id: '2', title: 'The Matrix', director: 'Lana Wachowski, Lilly Wachowski', releaseDate: '1999', genre: 'Sci-Fi' },\n     // Add more movie data\n   ];\n\n   const resolvers = {\n     Query: {\n       searchMoviesByTitle: (parent, args, context, info) => {\n         const { title } = args;\n         return movies.filter(movie => movie.title.toLowerCase().includes(title.toLowerCase()));\n       },\n     },\n   };\n   ```\n\n### Step 4: Set Up the Server\n\n1. **Initialize Apollo Server**: Set up Apollo Server with your schema and resolvers.\n\n   ```javascript\n   const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server');\n\n   // Define schema\n   const typeDefs = gql`\n     type Movie {\n       id: ID!\n       title: String!\n       director: String\n       releaseDate: String\n       genre: String\n     }\n\n     type Query {\n       searchMoviesByTitle(title: String!): [Movie]\n     }\n   `;\n\n   // Initialize Apollo Server\n   const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });\n\n   // Start the server\n   server.listen().then(({ url }) => {\n     console.log(`\ud83d\ude80 Server ready at ${url}`);\n   });\n   ```\n\n### Step 5: Test Your API\n\n1. **Run the Server**: Start your server and test the endpoint using a tool like Apollo Studio, GraphiQL, or Postman.\n\n2. **Sample Query**: Use a query like this to test searching for movies:\n\n   ```graphql\n   query {\n     searchMoviesByTitle(title: \"Inception\") {\n       id\n       title\n       director\n       releaseDate\n       genre\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n### Step 6: Expand and Secure\n\n1. **Add More Features**: Consider expanding your API with additional queries, mutations, and perhaps connecting it to a real database.\n\n2. **Authentication & Authorization**: Implement security measures to protect your API, such as authentication and authorization mechanisms.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to create a basic GraphQL API endpoint that allows users to search for movies by title. As you develop, you can enhance the API with more features and connect it to a real database for dynamic data handling."
