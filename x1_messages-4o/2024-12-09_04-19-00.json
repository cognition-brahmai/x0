For instance, I have a dictionary like this:\n```python\nperson = {'name': 'Jenne', 'age': 23}\n```\nAnd I want to format it with f-string similar to the following way:\n```python\nprint('My name {0[name]} and my age {1[age]}'.format(person, person))\nprint('My name {0} and my age {1}'.format(person['name'], person['age']))\n```"

        "content": "In Python 3.6 and later, you can utilize f-strings to format strings in a more readable and concise way. To use a dictionary with f-strings, you can directly access the dictionary keys inside the f-string by using curly braces `{}`. Here's how you can achieve this with your `person` dictionary:\n\n```python\nperson = {'name': 'Jenne', 'age': 23}\n\n# Using f-string to access dictionary keys\nprint(f\"My name is {person['name']} and my age is {person['age']}\")\n```\n\nThis f-string allows you to directly embed expressions inside the string literals, which makes it both powerful and easy to read. By using `f\"...\"`, you can include variables and expressions inside the string by enclosing them in curly braces `{}`. In this case, you're accessing the values associated with the keys `'name'` and `'age'` from the `person` dictionary."
