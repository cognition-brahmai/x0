For example, in CPU, I would use:\n\n```cpp\nvector< vector<int> > MyVector( 100 );\n...\nMyVector[i].push_back(j);\n```\n\nCan this be done with the Thrust library like:\n\n```cpp\nthrust::device_vector<thrust::device_vector<int>> d_vec(4);\n```\n\nIs there a way to create an array of device_vectors in the Thrust library?"

        "content": "The Thrust library in CUDA provides a high-level interface for GPU computing, similar to the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). However, it does not directly support the use of `thrust::device_vector` inside another `thrust::device_vector` (i.e., `thrust::device_vector<thrust::device_vector<int>>`) due to how memory allocation and data structures are managed on the device.\n\nThe main reason is that `thrust::device_vector` manages its own memory on the GPU, and nesting device vectors would require managing complex memory allocations across potentially non-contiguous memory spaces. This is unlike the CPU counterpart where memory management is more flexible.\n\n### Alternatives and Workarounds:\n\n1. **Array of Pointers:**\n   You can manage an array of pointers to `thrust::device_vector<int>`. This requires manual memory management and careful handling of data transfers between host and device. \n\n2. **Flat Structure:**\n   Use a single `thrust::device_vector<int>` to store all elements and maintain an auxiliary vector to keep track of segment offsets or sizes. This approach mimics a 2D array or a jagged array by manually managing indices.\n\n3. **Thrust Host Vector:**\n   If the nested vector logic is only needed on the host side, you can use `thrust::host_vector` for the outer vector and `thrust::device_vector` for the inner ones. This allows using `push_back` on the host vector but requires careful management of device memory.\n\n4. **Custom Data Structure:**\n   Implement a custom class or structure that manages an array of `thrust::device_vector<int>`, handling memory allocation and deallocation manually.\n\n### Example of Flat Structure:\n\nHere's a simplified example of how you might implement a flat structure:\n\n```cpp\n#include <thrust/device_vector.h>\n#include <thrust/host_vector.h>\n\nint main() {\n    // For simplicity, let's assume each sub-vector has a maximum size of 10\n    const int num_vectors = 4;\n    const int max_size_per_vector = 10;\n\n    // Flat device vector to hold all elements\n    thrust::device_vector<int> flat_vector(num_vectors * max_size_per_vector);\n\n    // Host vector to manage sizes\n    thrust::host_vector<int> sizes(num_vectors, 0);\n\n    // Example of adding an element to a specific vector\n    int vector_index = 2;\n    int element_to_add = 42;\n\n    if (sizes[vector_index] < max_size_per_vector) {\n        flat_vector[vector_index * max_size_per_vector + sizes[vector_index]] = element_to_add;\n        sizes[vector_index]++;\n    }\n\n    // Copy sizes back to device if needed\n    thrust::device_vector<int> d_sizes = sizes;\n\n    // Other operations...\n}\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates managing a flat array and keeping track of sizes manually, which can be adapted to your specific needs."
