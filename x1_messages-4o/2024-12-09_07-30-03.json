Here is the directory structure:\n```\n__init__.py\nstart.py\nparent.py\nsub/\n    __init__.py\n    relative.py\n```\n`start.py` only contains `import sub.relative`. `sub/relative.py` only contains `from .. import parent`. All other files are blank. When I execute the following on the command line:\n```\n$ cd /\n$ python start.py\n```\nI get the following error:\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"start.py\", line 1, in <module>\n    import sub.relative\n  File \"/home/cvondrick/sandbox/sub/relative.py\", line 1, in <module>\n    from .. import parent\nValueError: Attempted relative import beyond toplevel package\n```\nI am using Python 2.6. Can anyone explain why this is happening and how can I make this sandbox example work?"

        "content": "The issue you are encountering with relative imports is due to the way Python handles module imports and the execution of scripts, especially in older versions like Python 2.6.\n\n### Understanding the Issue\n\n1. **Relative Imports**: When you use relative imports (e.g., `from .. import parent`), Python expects the script to be part of a package. The `..` syntax indicates Python to look one level up in the package hierarchy for the `parent` module.\n\n2. **Execution Context**: When you run a Python script directly (as you are doing with `python start.py`), Python treats the script as the top-level module, which means it doesn't recognize the directory as a package. This is why you receive the \"Attempted relative import beyond toplevel package\" error.\n\n### Solutions\n\nTo resolve this issue, you have a few options:\n\n1. **Use Absolute Imports**: Modify `sub/relative.py` to use an absolute import:\n   ```python\n   import parent\n   ```\n   This assumes `parent.py` is in the Python path when you run the script.\n\n2. **Run the Script as a Module**: Use the `-m` switch to run your script as a module from the package context. This requires executing the command from the directory containing the package:\n   ```bash\n   $ cd /path/to/your/package\n   $ python -m start\n   ```\n   Ensure that `/path/to/your/package` is the directory containing your `__init__.py` and other files.\n\n3. **Modify the PYTHONPATH**: Adjust your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to include the parent directory of your package. This way, Python recognizes the package hierarchy:\n   ```bash\n   $ export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/your/package\n   $ python start.py\n   ```\n\n4. **Refactor the Directory Structure**: Ensure your entire project is structured as a package and run the script from within this context, making sure the imports align with the package hierarchy.\n\nFor Python 2.6, these solutions should help you circumvent the issue with relative imports. In newer Python versions, such as Python 3.x, handling relative imports and package execution is generally more straightforward, and upgrading might also be a consideration if possible."
