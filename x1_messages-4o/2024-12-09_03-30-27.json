However, I am struggling to determine if this event took place between midnight and midnight of the previous day. I have the current time 't' and a random time 't2' from my logs, and I understand that the time 24 hours ago is 't - 86400'. But, how can I round this up and down to the nearest midnight time? I am finding it hard to convert timestamps to and from datetime and to manipulate a datetime to set the time. \n\nHere is the code I have so far:\n\n```python\nt = time.time() # is now\nt2 = 1234567890 # some arbitrary time from my log\n```"

        "content": "To achieve what you're trying to do, you'll want to work with the `datetime` module, which provides a more intuitive way of handling dates and times compared to working directly with epoch timestamps. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you determine if `t2` falls between midnight of the previous day and the current time:\n\n1. **Convert Epoch to `datetime`:** Convert the epoch times `t` and `t2` to `datetime` objects.\n2. **Determine Midnight of the Previous Day:** Calculate the previous day's midnight by subtracting days from the current date.\n3. **Check the Range:** Compare `t2` against the calculated time range.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nimport time\n\n# Current time as epoch\nt = time.time()  # current time in seconds since epoch\n\n# Convert t (current time) from epoch to datetime\ncurrent_time = datetime.fromtimestamp(t)\n\n# Convert t2 (arbitrary past time) from epoch to datetime\nt2_time = datetime.fromtimestamp(1234567890)\n\n# Calculate midnight of the previous day\nmidnight_today = datetime.combine(current_time.date(), datetime.min.time())\nmidnight_previous_day = midnight_today - timedelta(days=1)\n\n# Check if t2_time is between midnight_previous_day and current_time\nif midnight_previous_day <= t2_time <= current_time:\n    print(\"t2 is within the range of the previous day's midnight and now.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"t2 is not within the range of the previous day's midnight and now.\")\n\n# For debugging:\nprint(\"Current time:\", current_time)\nprint(\"T2 time:\", t2_time)\nprint(\"Midnight of today:\", midnight_today)\nprint(\"Midnight of the previous day:\", midnight_previous_day)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`datetime.fromtimestamp()`**: This converts an epoch timestamp to a `datetime` object.\n- **`datetime.combine()`**: Combines a date with a time to create a `datetime` object. `datetime.min.time()` provides the midnight time (00:00:00).\n- **Subtracting a `timedelta(days=1)`**: This moves the date back by one day to find the previous day's midnight.\n- **Range Check**: The `if` statement checks if `t2_time` falls within the specified range.\n\nThis code will help you determine if the time `t2` falls between midnight of the previous day and the current time."
