Assuming the coordinates of the vertices are (x1,y1), (x2,y2), and (x3,y3), I want to compute the side lengths (a,b,c) using the distance formula:\na = sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)\nb = sqrt((x3-x2)^2 + (y3-y2)^2)\nc = sqrt((x1-x3)^2 + (y1-y3)^2)\nThen, I want to compute the measures of the angles (A,B,C) using the Law of Cosines:\nA = acos((b^2 + c^2 - a^2) / (2*b*c))\nB = acos((a^2 + c^2 - b^2) / (2*a*c))\nC = acos((a^2 + b^2 - c^2) / (2*a*b))\nNext, I want to use trigonometric functions to determine if the triangle is acute, right, or obtuse:\nIf A+B+C < pi, the triangle is acute.\nIf A+B+C = pi/2, the triangle is right.\nIf A+B+C > pi, the triangle is obtuse.\nFinally, I want to identify if the triangle is equilateral (all sides are equal), isosceles (two sides are equal), or scalene (no sides are equal) by comparing the side lengths:\nIf a=b=c, the triangle is equilateral.\nIf a=b or b=c or c=a, the triangle is isosceles.\nIf a!=b!=c, the triangle is scalene.\nPlease provide an SQL query that accomplishes all of these tasks using the given set of coordinates as input."

        "content": "To accomplish this task using SQL, we must break down the process into steps that calculate the side lengths, angles, and determine the type of triangle based on the properties you've described. However, SQL is not inherently designed for complex mathematical computations like trigonometric functions and angle calculations, so we'll need to use some creative SQL constructs and functions available in certain SQL dialects to achieve this. I'll provide an example using a common SQL dialect that supports basic mathematical operations and functions.\n\nLet's assume you have a table called `triangles` with columns `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3` representing the coordinates of the vertices.\n\n```sql\nWITH triangle_sides AS (\n  SELECT\n    id,\n    SQRT(POWER(x2-x1, 2) + POWER(y2-y1, 2)) AS a,\n    SQRT(POWER(x3-x2, 2) + POWER(y3-y2, 2)) AS b,\n    SQRT(POWER(x1-x3, 2) + POWER(y1-y3, 2)) AS c\n  FROM\n    triangles\n),\ntriangle_angles AS (\n  SELECT\n    id,\n    a,\n    b,\n    c,\n    ACOS((POWER(b, 2) + POWER(c, 2) - POWER(a, 2)) / (2 * b * c)) AS A,\n    ACOS((POWER(a, 2) + POWER(c, 2) - POWER(b, 2)) / (2 * a * c)) AS B,\n    ACOS((POWER(a, 2) + POWER(b, 2) - POWER(c, 2)) / (2 * a * b)) AS C\n  FROM\n    triangle_sides\n),\ntriangle_type AS (\n  SELECT\n    id,\n    a,\n    b,\n    c,\n    A,\n    B,\n    C,\n    CASE\n      WHEN a = b AND b = c THEN 'Equilateral'\n      WHEN a = b OR b = c OR c = a THEN 'Isosceles'\n      ELSE 'Scalene'\n    END AS side_type,\n    CASE\n      WHEN ABS(A + B + C - PI()) < 1e-10 THEN 'Right'\n      WHEN A + B + C < PI() THEN 'Acute'\n      ELSE 'Obtuse'\n    END AS angle_type\n  FROM\n    triangle_angles\n)\nSELECT\n  id,\n  a,\n  b,\n  c,\n  A,\n  B,\n  C,\n  side_type,\n  angle_type\nFROM\n  triangle_type;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Calculate Side Lengths (`triangle_sides` CTE):** \n   - Use the distance formula to compute the lengths of the sides `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n\n2. **Calculate Angles (`triangle_angles` CTE):** \n   - Use the Law of Cosines to compute angles `A`, `B`, and `C`.\n\n3. **Determine Triangle Type (`triangle_type` CTE):**\n   - **Side Type:** Determine if the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene based on side lengths.\n   - **Angle Type:** Check if the triangle is acute, right, or obtuse by evaluating the sum of angles.\n\nThis SQL query assumes a SQL environment that supports basic mathematical functions like `SQRT`, `POWER`, `ACOS`, and `PI()`. Additionally, the precision handling for floating-point arithmetic is considered in the angle type determination using a small delta (`1e-10`) to account for any floating-point inaccuracies. Adjust this value if necessary, based on your SQL environment's precision capabilities."
