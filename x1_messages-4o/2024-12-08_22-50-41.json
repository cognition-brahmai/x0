        "content": "To achieve this in Swift, you need to ensure that the `Fruit` class or struct is properly defined with the necessary properties, such as `name` and `weight`. Here's how you can implement and use the `measureWeight` function as described:\n\n1. **Define the `Fruit` Struct:**\n   Ensure that the `Fruit` struct has properties for `name` and `weight`.\n\n   ```swift\n   struct Fruit {\n       var name: String\n       var weight: Double // weight in grams\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Implement the `measureWeight` Function:**\n   This function takes a `Fruit` object and returns its weight.\n\n   ```swift\n   func measureWeight(object: Fruit) -> Double {\n       return object.weight\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Use the Function to Determine the Weight:**\n   Create an instance of `Fruit` and use the `measureWeight` function to determine if it weighs less than 50 grams.\n\n   ```swift\n   let apple = Fruit(name: \"Apple\", weight: 45) // Assume the weight of the apple is 45 grams\n   let appleWeight = measureWeight(object: apple)\n\n   if appleWeight < 50 {\n       print(\"True, the apple weighs less than 50 grams when picked.\")\n   } else {\n       print(\"False, the apple weighs 50 grams or more when picked.\")\n   }\n   ```\n\nThis code will check the weight of the `apple` instance and print the appropriate message based on whether it weighs less than 50 grams. You can replace the `apple` with any other fruit and its corresponding weight to use this code for other scenarios."
