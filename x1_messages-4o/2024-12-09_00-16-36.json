        "content": "To receive notifications when a key expires in Redis using the Python Redis API, you need to use the Pub/Sub feature of Redis. Setting a response callback for the `EXPIRE` command is not the correct approach, as it only affects the response to that command, not the expiration event itself.\n\nHere's how you can properly set up a listener for key expiration events:\n\n1. **Ensure Redis is configured correctly:**\n   Make sure that the `notify-keyspace-events` configuration in your `redis.conf` file is set to include `Ex` (notify on expired events). It should look something like this:\n\n   ```\n   notify-keyspace-events Ex\n   ```\n\n2. **Use Pub/Sub to listen for expire events:**\n\n   You need to subscribe to the expiration event channel. Redis uses a special channel format for keyspace notifications. Here's how you can do it in Python:\n\n```python\nimport redis\nimport time\nimport config\n\ndef main():\n    # Connect to Redis\n    client = redis.StrictRedis.from_url(config.REDIS_URI)\n\n    # Set up a Pub/Sub listener\n    pubsub = client.pubsub()\n\n    # Subscribe to the key expiration events (e.g., `__keyevent@0__:expired` for DB 0)\n    pubsub.psubscribe('__keyevent@0__:expired')\n\n    # Set a key with a timeout\n    client.set('a', 1)\n    client.expire('a', 5)\n\n    # Listen for messages\n    print(\"Waiting for key expiration events...\")\n    for message in pubsub.listen():\n        if message['type'] == 'pmessage':\n            print(f\"Key expired: {message['data']}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `__keyevent@0__:expired` is the pattern used to listen for expired events on database 0. If you're using a different database, replace `0` with your database number.\n- The `pubsub.listen()` method is used to continuously listen for messages. When a key expires, a message is printed indicating the key has expired.\n\nMake sure your Redis server is configured to allow keyspace notifications, and adjust the database number in the subscription pattern if necessary."
