For example, consider this HTML where I have two paragraphs with the same class \"content\":\n\n```html\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <p class=\"content\">Link1.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <p class=\"content\">Link2.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```"

        "content": "To use Selenium in Python to find elements by their class name, you would typically use the `find_elements_by_class_name` method. This method returns a list of WebElement objects that match the class name you specify. In your case, since there are multiple elements with the class \"content\", you'll get a list containing both paragraph elements.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can achieve this:\n\n1. First, make sure you have Selenium installed. If not, you can install it using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install selenium\n   ```\n\n2. Next, you'll need to download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser. For example, if you're using Chrome, download the ChromeDriver.\n\n3. Once you have the setup ready, you can use the following Python script to find and print the content of elements with the class \"content\":\n\n   ```python\n   from selenium import webdriver\n\n   # Set up the WebDriver (assuming you're using Chrome)\n   driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='/path/to/chromedriver')\n\n   # Open the HTML content\n   driver.get(\"file:///path/to/your/htmlfile.html\")  # Replace with your file path\n\n   # Find elements by class name\n   content_elements = driver.find_elements_by_class_name(\"content\")\n\n   # Iterate through the list of elements and print their text\n   for element in content_elements:\n       print(element.text)\n\n   # Close the WebDriver\n   driver.quit()\n   ```\n\nIn this script:\n\n- Replace `/path/to/chromedriver` with the actual path to your ChromeDriver executable.\n- Replace `file:///path/to/your/htmlfile.html` with the path to your local HTML file.\n- The `find_elements_by_class_name` method is used to find all elements with the specified class name. The elements are stored in the `content_elements` list.\n- The script iterates over the list and prints the text of each element.\n\nIf you're working with dynamic content or a web page, you might need to use `driver.get(\"http://example.com\")` to navigate to the URL instead. Always ensure that the WebDriver version matches your browser version."
