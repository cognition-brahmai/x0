This acts as a no-operation (no-op) placeholder where code is syntactically required but you don't want to execute any commands. Here's how you can implement it in C#:\n\n```csharp\nint a = 5;\nif (a == 5)\n{\n    // Do nothing\n    ;\n}\nelse\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World\");\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the semicolon (`;`) inside the `if` block acts as an empty statement, indicating that no action should be taken when the condition is true."
