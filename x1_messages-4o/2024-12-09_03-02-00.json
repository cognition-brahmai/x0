The first column and row are strings, while the rest of the matrix is integer. When reading a CSV, I can use `pd.read_csv('my.csv', index_col=3)` to set the third column as index. How can I achieve the same with my current DataFrame?"

Set the first row as the header (column names).\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'Col1': ['Row1', 'Row2', 'Row3'],\n    'A': [1, 2, 3],\n    'B': [4, 5, 6],\n    'C': [7, 8, 9]\n}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Set the first column as the index\ndf.set_index('Col1', inplace=True)\n\n# Set the first row as the header\ndf.columns = df.iloc[0]\ndf = df.drop(df.index[0])\n\n# Display the resulting DataFrame\nprint(df)\n```\n\nIn this example, the first column named 'Col1' is set as the index, and then the first row is used to rename the columns. The `iloc[0]` is used to select the first row, and then it's dropped from the data. Adjust the column name ('Col1' in this case) based on your actual DataFrame's column name."
