        "content": "To extend the `python-twitter` package by adding new methods to the base API class without modifying its core, you can use a technique known as \"monkey patching\" or subclassing. Here's how you can achieve this in a Pythonic and minimally disruptive way:\n\n### Method 1: Subclassing\n\n1. **Create a Subclass:**\n   Create a new class that inherits from the `python-twitter` API class. This allows you to add new methods without altering the original class.\n\n   ```python\n   import twitter\n\n   class ExtendedAPI(twitter.Api):\n       def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n           super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n\n       def new_method(self, *args, **kwargs):\n           # Your custom method implementation\n           pass\n   ```\n\n2. **Use the Subclass:**\n   When you need to use the extended functionality, instantiate the subclass instead of the original API class.\n\n   ```python\n   api = ExtendedAPI(consumer_key='your_consumer_key',\n                     consumer_secret='your_consumer_secret',\n                     access_token_key='your_access_token',\n                     access_token_secret='your_access_token_secret')\n\n   api.new_method()  # Call your custom method\n   ```\n\n### Method 2: Monkey Patching\n\n1. **Define the New Method:**\n   Define the method you want to add outside of any class.\n\n   ```python\n   def new_method(self, *args, **kwargs):\n       # Your custom method implementation\n       pass\n   ```\n\n2. **Patch the Method:**\n   Assign your new method to the `Api` class dynamically. This approach directly modifies the class at runtime.\n\n   ```python\n   import twitter\n\n   twitter.Api.new_method = new_method\n\n   api = twitter.Api(consumer_key='your_consumer_key',\n                     consumer_secret='your_consumer_secret',\n                     access_token_key='your_access_token',\n                     access_token_secret='your_access_token_secret')\n\n   api.new_method()  # Call your custom method\n   ```\n\n### Considerations\n\n- **Subclassing** is generally the more robust and maintainable option, especially if you plan to distribute your extended functionality or maintain it over time.\n- **Monkey Patching** is more of a quick fix or workaround. It can be less maintainable, especially if the original package changes in the future.\n- Ensure that any additional functionality respects the existing API's usage patterns and error handling to maintain consistency.\n- Document your extensions clearly, especially if others will be using your modified version of the API.\n\nBy following one of these methods, you can extend the `python-twitter` package with minimal disruption to its core functionality."
