For instance, I would like to generate a random float between 5 and 10 using a function like `random_float(5, 10)`. The function should be able to return any real number within the specified range, not just integers. Can you provide a solution for this?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can use the `numpy` library to generate a random float within a specified range. The `numpy.random.uniform` function is perfect for this task as it generates a random float between a specified low (inclusive) and high (exclusive) range.\n\nHere's how you can create a function `random_float` that generates a random float between `low` and `high`:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef random_float(low, high):\n    return np.random.uniform(low, high)\n\n# Example usage\nresult = random_float(5, 10)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis function uses `np.random.uniform(low, high)` to generate a random float between the `low` and `high` values you provide. The `low` value is inclusive, while the `high` value is exclusive, meaning the generated float can be equal to `low`, but will be less than `high`."
