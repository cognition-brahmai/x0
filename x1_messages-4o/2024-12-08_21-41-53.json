        "content": "To execute SQL queries from MATLAB, you typically need to establish a database connection using the Database Toolbox. Assuming you have the necessary toolbox and a compatible database driver, you can follow these steps to implement the SQL code in MATLAB:\n\n1. **Set up a Database Connection**: First, you need to connect to your database using the `database` function. Ensure you have the correct details for your database.\n\n2. **Execute the SQL Query**: Use the `exec` and `fetch` functions to run the SQL query and retrieve the results.\n\nHere is a sample MATLAB code to achieve this:\n\n```matlab\n% Define database connection parameters\ndatasource = 'yourDataSourceName'; % Data source name defined in ODBC\nusername = 'yourUsername';         % Database username\npassword = 'yourPassword';         % Database password\n\n% Establish a connection to the database\nconn = database(datasource, username, password);\n\n% Check if the connection was successful\nif isopen(conn)\n    % Define the SQL query\n    sqlquery = ['SELECT name FROM countries ' ...\n                'WHERE population >= 75000000 ' ...\n                'AND name NOT LIKE ''%[aeiou][aeiou][aeiou]%'' ' ...\n                'ORDER BY population DESC ' ...\n                'LIMIT 10'];\n\n    % Execute the SQL query\n    curs = exec(conn, sqlquery);\n\n    % Fetch the results into a MATLAB variable\n    curs = fetch(curs);\n\n    % Retrieve the data from the cursor\n    countryNames = curs.Data;\n\n    % Display the result\n    disp('Top 10 countries meeting the criteria:');\n    disp(countryNames);\n\n    % Close the cursor and the connection\n    close(curs);\n    close(conn);\nelse\n    disp('Database connection failed.');\n    disp(conn.Message);\nend\n```\n\n### Notes:\n- **ODBC Data Source**: You'll need to configure an ODBC data source for your database, which you can do through the ODBC Data Source Administrator on Windows, or use a JDBC driver for cross-platform compatibility.\n- **Toolbox Requirement**: Ensure you have the Database Toolbox installed in MATLAB.\n- **Error Handling**: Consider adding error handling to manage situations where the database connection fails or the query does not execute correctly.\n- **Database-Specific Details**: Depending on your database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), you might need to adjust the connection setup or SQL syntax slightly.\n\nThis approach allows you to run your SQL query directly from MATLAB and process the results as needed."
