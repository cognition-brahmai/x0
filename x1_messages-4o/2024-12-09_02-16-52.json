When I use 'list_filter' in Django admin, the filter is by default set to 'All' but I want to set it to 'pending' by default. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To customize the default filter choice in Django admin, you'll need to override the default behavior of the `list_filter`. Django doesn't provide a built-in way to set the default filter choice directly, so you'll have to implement a workaround by overriding the `changelist_view` method in your admin class. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _\nfrom django.http import HttpResponseRedirect\nfrom urllib.parse import urlencode\nfrom .models import YourModel\n\nclass YourModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    list_display = ('id', 'status', ...)  # add your fields here\n    list_filter = ('status',)\n\n    def changelist_view(self, request, extra_context=None):\n        # Check if the list is being accessed for the first time\n        if 'status__exact' not in request.GET:\n            # Set the default filter value to 'pending'\n            default_filter = {'status__exact': 'pending'}\n            query_string = urlencode(default_filter)\n            return HttpResponseRedirect(f\"{request.path}?{query_string}\")\n        return super().changelist_view(request, extra_context=extra_context)\n\nadmin.site.register(YourModel, YourModelAdmin)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Override `changelist_view`:** The `changelist_view` method is responsible for rendering the change list page in the admin. By overriding it, you can inject custom logic before the page is rendered.\n\n2. **Check for Existing Filter:** The method first checks if the `status` filter is already present in the request's GET parameters. If it's not present, it means the user has not applied any filter yet, and you can set the default.\n\n3. **Set Default Filter:** If the filter is not applied, the method constructs a query string with the default filter set to `'pending'` and redirects the user to the same page with this filter applied.\n\n4. **Redirect to Filtered Page:** `HttpResponseRedirect` is used to redirect the user to the new URL with the default filter applied.\n\nThis customization ensures that whenever someone accesses the admin page for `YourModel`, the `status` filter will default to `pending`, unless the user explicitly selects another filter."
