        "content": "To add a new attribute to a document in MongoDB using the Python driver (pymongo), you'll need to update the existing document using the `update_one` method. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. First, ensure you have `pymongo` installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pymongo\n   ```\n\n2. Next, use the following Python code to add the `created_time` attribute to your document:\n\n   ```python\n   from pymongo import MongoClient\n   from datetime import datetime\n\n   # Connect to the MongoDB server\n   client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')  # Replace with your MongoDB URI if necessary\n\n   # Select the database and collection\n   db = client['your_database_name']\n   collection = db['your_collection_name']\n\n   # Define the filter to find the document you want to update\n   filter = {'_id': 123456}  # Adjust the filter as needed for your document\n\n   # Define the new field to add\n   new_field = {'$set': {'created_time': datetime.now()}}\n\n   # Update the document\n   result = collection.update_one(filter, new_field)\n\n   # Check if the update was successful\n   if result.modified_count > 0:\n       print(\"Document updated successfully.\")\n   else:\n       print(\"No document found or updated.\")\n   ```\n\nThis code does the following:\n\n- Connects to the MongoDB server.\n- Selects the database and collection where your document resides.\n- Defines a filter to locate the document you want to update (in this case, using `_id: 123456`).\n- Uses the `$set` operator to add or update the `created_time` attribute with the current date and time.\n- Executes the `update_one` method to apply the update to the document.\n- Checks if the document was successfully updated by inspecting `result.modified_count`.\n\nMake sure to replace `'your_database_name'` and `'your_collection_name'` with the actual names of your database and collection. Adjust the filter as needed if your document identification criteria are different."
