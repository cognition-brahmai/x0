Currently, I am running multiple instances of a Python script, each from a different directory and using a separate shell window. Unfortunately, Windows assigns the same name to each of these shell windows: \n<pre><code>&lt;User&gt;: C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe - &lt;script.py&gt;</code></pre>\nIs there a Python command that can help me set this name to something else?"

        "content": "Yes, you can set the title of a Windows command-line terminal from within a Python script using the `os` module. You can achieve this by using the `os.system` function to execute a command-line instruction that changes the title. Here's a simple way to do it:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Set the title of the command-line window\nos.system('title Your New Title Here')\n\n# Your script logic\nprint(\"This is your script running with a new title!\")\n```\n\nReplace `'Your New Title Here'` with whatever title you want to assign to the command-line window. When you run this script, the title of the terminal window will change to the specified string. This can help you differentiate between multiple instances of your script running in different directories."
