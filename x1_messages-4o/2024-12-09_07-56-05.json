I have tried using `# noqa: C901` in various configurations, but the error keeps showing up. I thought placing the `# noqa` comment above the function or on the same line as the `def` declaration would work, like in the following example:\n\n```python\nclass Klass():\n    def my_complex_method(self):  # noqa: C901\n        \"\"\"\n        lots of if's and return's\n        \"\"\"\n```\nHowever, I continue to get an error message from `flake8` as shown below:\n\n```python\nsrc/test/_resource.py:147:5: C901 'Resource.render' is too complex (22)\n    def render(self, request):  # noqa: C901\n    ^\n```\nI am aware that I can ignore this globally or for the entire file, but I want to catch it if other functions in the file are too complex. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "To ignore the `C901` complexity warning for a specific function in your code using `flake8`, you need to ensure that the `# noqa: C901` comment is correctly placed. However, sometimes the placement or configuration might not work due to various reasons, such as the specific version of `flake8` or the plugins you are using.\n\nHere are some steps you can follow to make sure the `# noqa` comment works as expected:\n\n1. **Ensure Correct Placement**: Place the `# noqa: C901` comment at the end of the function definition line. This is typically where `flake8` expects it.\n\n   ```python\n   def my_complex_method(self):  # noqa: C901\n       # Your complex code here\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Flake8 Version**: Make sure you're using a version of `flake8` that supports the `# noqa` comment for ignoring specific warnings. You may want to update `flake8` to the latest version to ensure compatibility.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade flake8\n   ```\n\n3. **Check for Additional Plugins**: If you're using additional `flake8` plugins (such as `flake8-cognitive-complexity`), ensure they also recognize the `# noqa: C901` directive. Some plugins might have their own way of handling ignores.\n\n4. **Verify Configuration**: Check your `.flake8`, `setup.cfg`, or `tox.ini` configuration files to ensure there are no settings that might override or conflict with the `# noqa` directive.\n\n5. **Try an Alternative**: If the above steps do not work, you can try placing the `# noqa: C901` comment on the line immediately before the function definition.\n\n   ```python\n   # noqa: C901\n   def my_complex_method(self):\n       # Your complex code here\n   ```\n\n6. **Debugging**: Run `flake8` with verbose mode to get more information on why the ignore might not be working:\n\n   ```bash\n   flake8 --verbose\n   ```\n\n7. **Contact Support or Community**: If none of the above solutions work, it might be worth reaching out to the `flake8` community or checking their GitHub issues page for similar problems and solutions.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to suppress the `C901` warning for the specific function without affecting the rest of your codebase."
