        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that Python's `pickle` module has limitations when it comes to serializing certain types of objects, such as functions defined locally within a script or within a Jupyter Notebook. The `create_model` function is likely defined in your script, and `pickle` is unable to serialize it directly.\n\nHowever, there is a workaround for saving and loading Scikit-Learn-Keras models using the Keras model's own saving capabilities. Typically, you can use the `joblib` library or other methods to save the Scikit-Learn parts, and Keras has its own methods for saving the model architecture and weights.\n\nHere's how you can save and load your model:\n\n### Saving the Model\n\n1. **Save the Keras Model:**\n\n   Use Keras's own `save` method to save the model architecture, weights, and training configuration to a single file. You can save it as an HDF5 file or use the TensorFlow SavedModel format.\n\n   ```python\n   model_tt.model.save('model.h5')  # saves weights and architecture together\n   ```\n\n2. **Save the Scikit-Learn Wrapper:**\n\n   Use `joblib` to save any additional Scikit-Learn-specific information, such as feature preprocessing steps.\n\n   ```python\n   import joblib\n\n   # Assuming you have additional preprocessing steps or a pipeline\n   joblib.dump(preprocessing_pipeline, 'preprocessing_pipeline.pkl')\n   ```\n\n### Loading the Model\n\n1. **Load the Keras Model:**\n\n   Use Keras's `load_model` function to load the model from the file.\n\n   ```python\n   from keras.models import load_model\n\n   loaded_model = load_model('model.h5')\n   ```\n\n2. **Load the Scikit-Learn Wrapper:**\n\n   Load any additional Scikit-Learn-specific information using `joblib`.\n\n   ```python\n   preprocessing_pipeline = joblib.load('preprocessing_pipeline.pkl')\n   ```\n\nThis approach separates the Keras model saving/loading from any other Scikit-Learn operations you may have, and it uses the tools best suited for each part of the process. Remember that any custom objects or layers used in the Keras model need to be defined in your environment when loading the model."
