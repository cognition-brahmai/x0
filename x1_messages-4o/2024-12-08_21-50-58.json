        "content": "To solve this problem using MATLAB, you need a list of animal names to work with. Since you want to find animals with names containing a single, non-repeating vowel, you can create a script to filter the list based on this criterion.\n\nBelow is a MATLAB script that demonstrates how you can achieve this. You'll need to input a list of animal names to get started. For demonstration purposes, I'll provide a small sample list, but you'll need to expand it based on your requirements.\n\n```matlab\n% Sample list of animal names\nanimalList = {'Tiger', 'Lion', 'Cheetah', 'Leopard', 'Panda', ...\n              'Zebra', 'Giraffe', 'Kangaroo', 'Elephant', 'Penguin', ...\n              'Koala', 'Crocodile', 'Flamingo', 'Peacock', 'Parrot'};\n\n% Vowels to check\nvowels = 'AEIOUaeiou';\n\n% Initialize an empty cell array to store results\nvalidAnimals = {};\n\n% Loop through each animal name\nfor i = 1:length(animalList)\n    name = animalList{i};\n    vowelCount = zeros(1, length(vowels));\n    \n    % Count the occurrence of each vowel\n    for j = 1:length(vowels)\n        vowelCount(j) = sum(name == vowels(j));\n    end\n    \n    % Check if exactly one vowel appears once\n    if sum(vowelCount == 1) == 1\n        % Find the vowel that appears once\n        singleVowelIndex = find(vowelCount == 1);\n        singleVowel = vowels(singleVowelIndex(1));\n        \n        % Check that this vowel is the only one in the name\n        if sum(ismember(name, vowels)) == 1\n            % Add to the list of valid animals\n            validAnimals{end+1} = name;\n        end\n    end\nend\n\n% Display the valid animals\ndisp('Animals with a single, non-repeating vowel in their name:');\ndisp(validAnimals);\n```\n\nThis script will output a list of animal names from your provided list that meet the criteria of having a single, non-repeating vowel. You can modify the `animalList` variable with a more comprehensive list of common animal names to get better results.\n\nIf you need more animals, consider expanding the list with common animals found in different regions or habitats, ensuring they are not rare or endangered. Remember, the effectiveness of this script depends on the comprehensiveness of your input list."
