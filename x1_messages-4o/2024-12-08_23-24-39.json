        "content": "To calculate the probability of rolling a total of 8 with 3 fair dice while guaranteeing that at least one of the dice shows an odd number, you can simulate all possible outcomes and count the successful cases that meet the criteria. Here is a sample C# code that demonstrates how to achieve this:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass DiceProbability\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        int successfulOutcomes = 0;\n        int totalOutcomes = 0;\n\n        for (int d1 = 1; d1 <= 6; d1++)\n        {\n            for (int d2 = 1; d2 <= 6; d2++)\n            {\n                for (int d3 = 1; d3 <= 6; d3++)\n                {\n                    totalOutcomes++;\n                    int sum = d1 + d2 + d3;\n\n                    // Check if the sum is 8 and at least one die is odd\n                    if (sum == 8 && (d1 % 2 != 0 || d2 % 2 != 0 || d3 % 2 != 0))\n                    {\n                        successfulOutcomes++;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        double probability = (double)successfulOutcomes / totalOutcomes;\n\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Total outcomes: \" + totalOutcomes);\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Successful outcomes: \" + successfulOutcomes);\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Probability: \" + probability);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Loop Through Each Die**: The code uses three nested loops to iterate over all possible outcomes of the three dice, each ranging from 1 to 6.\n\n2. **Calculate Sum**: For each combination of dice rolls, it calculates the sum of the three dice.\n\n3. **Check Conditions**: It checks if the sum is 8 and if at least one of the dice is an odd number.\n\n4. **Count Successful Outcomes**: If both conditions are met, it increments the `successfulOutcomes` counter.\n\n5. **Calculate Probability**: Finally, it calculates the probability by dividing the number of successful outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible combinations are considered, and only those meeting the criteria are counted as successful."
