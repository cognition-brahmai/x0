        "content": "To solve this numerical puzzle, we'll start by examining the sequence: 2, 5, 11, 23, 47, 95, 191. We need to identify a pattern or formula that explains how each number is derived from the previous one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Identify the Differences:**\n   - Subtract consecutive numbers to find the differences:\n     - \\(5 - 2 = 3\\)\n     - \\(11 - 5 = 6\\)\n     - \\(23 - 11 = 12\\)\n     - \\(47 - 23 = 24\\)\n     - \\(95 - 47 = 48\\)\n     - \\(191 - 95 = 96\\)\n\n2. **Examine the Differences:**\n   - The differences are: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96.\n   - Notice that each difference is double the previous one. This suggests a pattern where each difference is \\(2^n \\times 3\\).\n\n3. **Generalize the Pattern:**\n   - The difference between consecutive terms is doubling:\n     - \\(3 = 3 \\times 2^0\\)\n     - \\(6 = 3 \\times 2^1\\)\n     - \\(12 = 3 \\times 2^2\\)\n     - \\(24 = 3 \\times 2^3\\)\n     - \\(48 = 3 \\times 2^4\\)\n     - \\(96 = 3 \\times 2^5\\)\n\n4. **Predict the Next Difference:**\n   - Following the pattern, the next difference would be \\(3 \\times 2^6 = 192\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Next Number:**\n   - Add this difference to the last number in the sequence:\n   - \\(191 + 192 = 383\\)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe next number in the sequence is **383**.\n\n```markdown\n383\n```"
