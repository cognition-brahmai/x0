After fitting the data using the following code:\n\n```python\nlogistic.fit(InputDATA, OutputDATA)\n```\n\nI am able to retrieve the coefficients for the classification using `logistic.coef_`, which returns a 2D array with 4 rows (I have four classes) and n columns (one for each feature). This behaviour aligns with the Scikit-Learn documentation:\n\n> coef_ : array, shape (n_features, ) or (n_targets, n_features) Estimated coefficients for the linear regression problem. If multiple targets are passed during the fit (y 2D), this is a 2D array of shape (n_targets, n_features), while if only one target is passed, this is a 1D array of length n_features.\n\nHowever, I am confused as to why I am seeing different coefficients for different classes. Shouldn't there just be one hypothesis which predicts the output?"

        "content": "In multiclass classification using Logistic Regression, especially when using the one-vs-rest (OvR) approach, each class is treated as a separate binary classification problem. Here's how it works conceptually:\n\n1. **One-vs-Rest (OvR) Approach**: For a problem with \\( C \\) classes, the classifier fits \\( C \\) binary classifiers. Each binary classifier is trained to distinguish one class from all the others. Therefore, for each class, you get a separate set of coefficients. This is why you see a 2D array with a shape of \\( (n\\_classes, n\\_features) \\).\n\n2. **Coefficients for Each Class**: Each row in the `coef_` array corresponds to one of these binary classifiers. So, the coefficients for class 1 describe the decision boundary that separates class 1 from all other classes, the coefficients for class 2 describe the boundary for class 2, and so on.\n\n3. **Prediction**: When predicting, the logistic regression model calculates the probability of each class using the respective set of coefficients and assigns the class with the highest probability.\n\nThis behavior aligns with the one-vs-rest strategy, which is typically used for multiclass classification with algorithms inherently designed for binary classification. This is why you observe different coefficients for different classes.\n\nIf you were expecting a single hypothesis, that would be more akin to multiclass strategies like softmax (used in multinomial logistic regression), which is another approach where the probabilities are directly modeled for all classes, but OvR is common in Scikit-Learn's implementation of logistic regression for multiclass problems. You can also use the `multinomial` option in the `LogisticRegression` class if you want to switch to the multinomial approach, provided your solver supports it (e.g., `solver='lbfgs'`)."
