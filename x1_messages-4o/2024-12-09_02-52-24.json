        "content": "I recently installed Anaconda 4.2.0 with Python 3.5.2 on my Mac OS X. However, I am facing an issue wherein I am unable to update any packages in the iPython console. The problem occurs when the console displays \"Proceed ([y]/n)?\" after presenting the package dependencies. At this point, it doesn't accept any inputs including 'Enter', 'y-Enter' etc. Below is an example of the situation:\n\n```python\n!conda create -n graphlab-env python=2.7 anaconda\nFetching package metadata .......\nSolving package specifications: ..........\n\nPackage plan for installation in environment /Users/Abhijit/anaconda/envs/graphlab-env:\n\nThe following packages will be downloaded:\n\n    package                    |            build\n    ---------------------------|-----------------\n    python-2.7.12              |                1         9.5 MB\n    _license-1.1               |           py27_1          80 KB\n    alabaster-0.7.9            |           py27_0          11 KB\n    anaconda-clean-1.0.0       |           py27_0           3 KB\n.\n.\n.\n    nbpresent-3.0.2            |           py27_0         463 KB\n    anaconda-4.2.0             |      np111py27_0           6 KB\n    ------------------------------------------------------------\n                                           Total:       143.9 MB\n\nThe following NEW packages will be INSTALLED:\n\n    _license:           1.1-py27_1         \n    _nb_ext_conf:       0.3.0-py27_0       \n    alabaster:          0.7.9-py27_0       \n    anaconda:           4.2.0-np111py27_0  \n    anaconda-clean:     1.0.0-py27_0       \n.\n.\n.\n    yaml:               0.1.6-0            \n    zlib:               1.2.8-3            \n\nProceed ([y]/n)? \n```\n\nAfter this step, it does not respond. I am able to break out of this loop only when I enter 'Ctrl-C'. I have tried using Shift-Enter, Alt-Enter, Ctrl-Enter, Cmd-Enter, but none of it seems to work. What am I missing here?"

        "content": "It seems like you're encountering an issue with input handling in the iPython console when using the `conda` command. This might be due to how the iPython console manages input/output operations, particularly with interactive command line tools like `conda`. \n\nHere are a few potential solutions to try:\n\n1. **Run in Terminal**: Instead of running the `conda` command within the iPython console, try running it directly in the terminal. Open a Terminal window and execute the `conda` command there. This should allow you to provide input without issues.\n\n2. **Use `-y` Flag**: If you want to bypass the prompt altogether, you can use the `-y` flag with the `conda` command, which automatically answers \"yes\" to any prompts:\n   ```bash\n   conda create -n graphlab-env python=2.7 anaconda -y\n   ```\n\n3. **Check iPython Configuration**: Sometimes, the issue might stem from iPython's configuration. Ensure that your iPython setup is not interfering with standard input/output behavior. You can try resetting iPython to its default configuration:\n   ```bash\n   ipython profile reset\n   ```\n\n4. **Update Anaconda/Conda**: If feasible, consider updating Anaconda or just the `conda` tool to the latest version, as this might resolve any bugs or compatibility issues:\n   ```bash\n   conda update conda\n   ```\n\n5. **Check for Interference**: Ensure there are no other processes or configurations (such as custom terminal settings or shell configurations) that might be interfering with how input is handled.\n\nIf none of these solutions resolve the issue, it could be a specific bug or compatibility problem with the version of Anaconda or iPython you are using. In such cases, consulting the Anaconda or iPython community forums might provide additional insights or workarounds."
