        "content": "A haiku is a traditional form of Japanese poetry that consists of three lines with a syllable pattern of 5-7-5. It typically captures a moment in nature or an emotion, emphasizing simplicity, depth, and a connection to the natural world. Haikus often include a seasonal reference, known as a \"kigo,\" and a \"cutting word,\" or \"kireji,\" which provides a pause or shift in perspective."
