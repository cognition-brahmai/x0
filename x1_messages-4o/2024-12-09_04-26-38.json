I have a 150MB single-sheet Excel file that takes about 7 minutes to open on a very powerful machine using Python with the xlrd library. I'm open to different approaches and programming languages, and I'm aiming to reduce the opening time to under 30 seconds. The Excel file is provided by a client and cannot be converted into any other format before we receive it. Here is the python code I am currently using:\n\n```python\nimport xlrd\nwb = xlrd.open_workbook(file)\nsh = wb.sheet_by_index(0)\n```\n\nAs a challenge, I am offering a bounty for a solution that can open the following 200MB excel file in under 30 seconds: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_CXvCTOo7_2VW9id2VXRWZrbzQ/view?usp=sharing. The file consists of string data in column 1, date data in column 9, and numbers in column 11."

        "content": "To efficiently open large Excel files, especially when performance is a key concern, consider using a more performant library than `xlrd`. Here are a few approaches you can try, focusing on different libraries and methods that are known for their speed:\n\n### 1. **Using `openpyxl` with `read_only` mode**\n\n`openpyxl` is a Python library that can handle reading and writing Excel files. It has a `read_only` mode that can significantly improve the performance for large files.\n\n```python\nfrom openpyxl import load_workbook\n\ndef open_excel_with_openpyxl(file):\n    wb = load_workbook(filename=file, read_only=True, data_only=True)\n    sh = wb.active\n    # Iterate over rows\n    for row in sh.iter_rows(min_row=1, max_col=sh.max_column, max_row=sh.max_row):\n        # Process each row\n        pass\n\nfile = 'your_file_path.xlsx'\nopen_excel_with_openpyxl(file)\n```\n\n### 2. **Using `pandas` with `read_excel`**\n\n`pandas` is a powerful data analysis library in Python that provides a `read_excel` method. Using this with the `engine='openpyxl'` or `engine='pyxlsb'` for `.xlsb` files can offer better performance.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef open_excel_with_pandas(file):\n    df = pd.read_excel(file, engine='openpyxl')\n    # Process the DataFrame\n    # For example, accessing specific columns:\n    string_data = df.iloc[:, 0]\n    date_data = df.iloc[:, 8]\n    number_data = df.iloc[:, 10]\n\nfile = 'your_file_path.xlsx'\nopen_excel_with_pandas(file)\n```\n\n### 3. **Using `pyxlsb` for .xlsb files**\n\nIf your file's format is `.xlsb`, consider using `pyxlsb`, which is optimized for .xlsb binary files.\n\n```python\nfrom pyxlsb import open_workbook\n\ndef open_excel_with_pyxlsb(file):\n    with open_workbook(file) as wb:\n        with wb.get_sheet(1) as sheet:\n            for row in sheet.rows():\n                # Process each row\n                pass\n\nfile = 'your_file_path.xlsb'\nopen_excel_with_pyxlsb(file)\n```\n\n### 4. **Using `xlsx2csv` for conversion**\n\nIf you are open to using command-line tools, `xlsx2csv` can convert Excel files into CSV format, which can then be quickly read with Python.\n\n```bash\nxlsx2csv your_file.xlsx output.csv\n```\n\nThen, read the CSV file using `pandas`:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef open_excel_with_csv(file):\n    df = pd.read_csv(file)\n    # Process the DataFrame\n    pass\n\ncsv_file = 'output.csv'\nopen_excel_with_csv(csv_file)\n```\n\n### Tips for Optimization:\n- **Chunk Processing**: If memory is a constraint, read the file in chunks using `pandas` by specifying `chunksize`.\n- **Parallel Processing**: If you have multi-threading capabilities, consider processing rows in parallel.\n- **Optimize Data Types**: Ensure that the data types of columns are optimized to reduce memory usage.\n\nBy using these methods, you should be able to significantly reduce the time it takes to open and process large Excel files. Adjust the file path and consider the file format to choose the most appropriate library or tool."
