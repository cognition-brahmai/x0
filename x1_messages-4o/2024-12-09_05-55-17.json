Here is a short example:\n\n```python\na=[[1,2],[5,3],5,[5,6],[2,2]]\nfor b in a:\n    print b[0]\n```\nThe output was:\n\n```shell\n1\n5\nTypeError: 'int' object is unsubscriptable\n```\n\nCould you please explain what an 'unsubscriptable' object is and why am I getting this error in my code?"

        "content": "In Python, the term \"unsubscriptable\" in a `TypeError` refers to an attempt to access an element of an object using the subscript notation (i.e., using square brackets `[]`) when the object does not support this operation. Subscriptable objects include lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries, and other sequence or mapping types that allow you to retrieve elements using an index or key.\n\nIn your code example:\n\n```python\na = [[1, 2], [5, 3], 5, [5, 6], [2, 2]]\nfor b in a:\n    print b[0]\n```\n\nYou are iterating over a list `a`. The list `a` contains a mix of lists and an integer. When you reach the integer `5` in the list, the code tries to access `5[0]`, which leads to an error because an integer is not a subscriptable object. Integers do not support indexing, hence the `TypeError: 'int' object is unsubscriptable`.\n\nTo fix this error, you need to ensure that you only try to subscript objects that support this operation. Here's one way to handle it:\n\n```python\na = [[1, 2], [5, 3], 5, [5, 6], [2, 2]]\nfor b in a:\n    if isinstance(b, list):  # Check if b is a list\n        print(b[0])\n```\n\nThis code snippet uses `isinstance` to check if `b` is a list before trying to access `b[0]`. This way, it avoids trying to subscript an integer, preventing the error."
