I have a fully convolutional network for semantic segmentation with a loss function of weighted binary cross entropy. There are 5 classes and the batch size is 16. I understand that the binary cross entropy is applied to each pixel in the image with regards to each class, which results in each pixel having 5 loss values. However, I am unsure of what happens after this step. How are the losses for different classes combined to produce a single loss value for an image? How exactly are these different pixel combinations happening - where is it being summed / where is it being averaged? \n\nI have a basic implementation borrowed from Kaggle and modified for multi-label prediction. The total validation loss of the network after 20 epochs is ~1%; however, the mean intersection over union scores for the first 4 classes are above 95% each, but for the last class its 23%. This indicates that the 5th class isn't doing well at all. However, this loss in accuracy isn't being reflected at all in the loss. Hence, I'm not sure how to reconcile this information."

        "content": "To understand how the total loss is calculated over multiple classes in Keras, especially for a multi-label semantic segmentation problem, let's break down the typical process:\n\n### Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy in Multi-Class Segmentation\n\nIn your case, you are using weighted binary cross-entropy for each class separately. Each pixel in the image has a binary prediction for each of the 5 classes, resulting in 5 separate loss values per pixel.\n\n1. **Pixel-wise Loss Calculation**: For each pixel, you calculate the binary cross-entropy for each class. This results in a 3D tensor of shape `(height, width, num_classes)` where each entry corresponds to the binary cross-entropy loss for a particular class at a specific pixel.\n\n2. **Class-wise Combination**: To aggregate these losses into a single scalar loss value for an image, you typically sum or average the losses across the classes and pixels. In practice, this can be done in several steps:\n   - **Sum/Average over Classes**: You sum (or average) the loss values across all classes for each pixel, resulting in a 2D tensor of shape `(height, width)`.\n   - **Sum/Average over Pixels**: You then sum (or average) these values over all pixels to get a single scalar loss for the entire image.\n\n3. **Batch-wise Combination**: When you have a batch of images, the loss for each image is typically averaged over the batch to get the final loss value used for backpropagation.\n\n### Addressing Imbalanced Class Performance\n\nThe issue of the 5th class not performing well, despite a low overall loss, can be indicative of class imbalance or difficulty in learning that particular class. Here are some strategies to address this:\n\n1. **Class Weights**: Ensure that the weights for each class in the weighted binary cross-entropy are set appropriately. If one class is less frequent or harder to learn, it might need a higher weight to have a more substantial impact on the loss.\n\n2. **Loss Function Modification**: You might consider using focal loss, which can help focus learning on harder examples or classes.\n\n3. **Data Augmentation**: Increase the representation of the 5th class in your dataset through augmentation techniques to help the model learn better.\n\n4. **Model Architecture**: Ensure that the model architecture is adequate for capturing the features necessary for segmenting the 5th class. Sometimes, adding more layers or using a different network architecture can help.\n\n5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Since the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) is low for the 5th class, continue monitoring this metric and use it to guide further improvements, even if the overall loss does not reflect this class's performance accurately.\n\n6. **Learning Rate and Training Strategy**: Adjust the learning rate or use strategies like learning rate annealing or early stopping based on the performance of the 5th class.\n\nBy addressing these aspects, you can better align the loss function with the model's ability to predict all classes accurately, including the challenging ones."
