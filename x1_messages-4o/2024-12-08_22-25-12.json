A technology that harnesses the energy from the sun to produce electricity. It's becoming increasingly efficient and cost-effective.\n2. A technology that captures the power of the wind to generate electricity. It has a small footprint and produces no emissions.\n3. A technology that involves constructing buildings using eco-friendly materials and design to reduce energy consumption and emissions.\n4. A technology that involves using electric vehicles instead of gasoline-powered ones to greatly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.\n5. A technology that helps in conserving water resources and reducing water waste by implementing low-flow toilets and showerheads, rainwater harvesting systems, and smart irrigation.\nCan you match the right technology to its description and find all five of them?"
