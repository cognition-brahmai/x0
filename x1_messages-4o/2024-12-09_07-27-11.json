        "content": "The error you are encountering indicates that the `pg_config` executable, which is part of the PostgreSQL development libraries, is not found in your system's PATH. This executable is necessary for building `psycopg2` from source.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you should follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install PostgreSQL Development Libraries**: Ensure that you have the PostgreSQL client libraries and development headers installed on your system. The installation process depends on your operating system:\n\n   - **On Debian/Ubuntu**:\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt-get update\n     sudo apt-get install libpq-dev\n     ```\n\n   - **On Fedora/RHEL/CentOS**:\n     ```bash\n     sudo dnf install postgresql-devel\n     ```\n     or\n     ```bash\n     sudo yum install postgresql-devel\n     ```\n\n   - **On macOS**:\n     If you have Homebrew installed, you can use it to install PostgreSQL:\n     ```bash\n     brew install postgresql\n     ```\n\n2. **Ensure `pg_config` is in PATH**: After installing the development libraries, verify that `pg_config` is accessible. You can check this by running:\n   ```bash\n   which pg_config\n   ```\n   If it returns a path, that means `pg_config` is in your PATH. If not, you may need to add its directory to your PATH.\n\n3. **Install psycopg2**: Once the above steps are completed, you can install `psycopg2` using pip within your virtual environment:\n   ```bash\n   pip install psycopg2\n   ```\n   Alternatively, if you do not need to compile from source and prefer a binary package, you can install `psycopg2-binary`:\n   ```bash\n   pip install psycopg2-binary\n   ```\n   Note that `psycopg2-binary` is a stand-alone package that includes all dependencies and does not require `pg_config`. However, it is recommended primarily for development and testing, not for production use.\n\nAfter following these steps, `psycopg2` should be successfully installed in your virtual environment."
