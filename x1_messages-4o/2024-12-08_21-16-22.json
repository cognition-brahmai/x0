The container is made up of a material that conducts electricity, and you need to calculate the volume without touching it. The only information you have is that the diameter of the spherical container is 14 cm. \nUsing your knowledge and reasoning abilities, determine how you can calculate the volume of the spherical container without touching it. Once you have figured out the method, provide the volume rounded to the nearest hundredth."

        "content": "To calculate the volume of the spherical container without touching it, we can use the information given: the diameter of the sphere is 14 cm. With this information, we can calculate the radius, which is half of the diameter.\n\n1. Calculate the radius:\n\\[\n\\text{Radius} = \\frac{\\text{Diameter}}{2} = \\frac{14 \\text{ cm}}{2} = 7 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\n2. Use the formula for the volume of a sphere:\n\\[\nV = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3\n\\]\n\n3. Substitute the radius into the formula:\n\\[\nV = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (7 \\text{ cm})^3\n\\]\n\n4. Calculate the volume:\n\\[\nV = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (343 \\text{ cm}^3) \\approx \\frac{4}{3} \\times 3.14159 \\times 343\n\\]\n\n5. Compute the final result:\n\\[\nV \\approx \\frac{4 \\times 3.14159 \\times 343}{3} \\approx 1436.76 \\text{ cm}^3\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the volume of the spherical container is approximately 1436.76 cm\u00b3, rounded to the nearest hundredth."
