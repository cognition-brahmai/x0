Therefore, a rectangle always has a rectangular shape. However, a square is a special type of rectangle where all four sides are equal in length. So, in terms of specific shapes, a rectangle can be either:\n\n1. A regular rectangle with unequal adjacent sides.\n2. A square, which is a special case of a rectangle with all sides equal.\n\nThese are the shapes a rectangle can have."
