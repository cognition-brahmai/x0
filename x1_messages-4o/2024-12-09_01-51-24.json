I have a VPN connection, and when I run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`, it serves on 0.0.0.0:8000, which means it can be accessed via localhost and my real IP. I'm keen on restricting access to the server via the localhost only to prevent robots from scanning me. Is there a way to do this? I've tried `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 127.0.0.1:8000` but it doesn't work. Alternatively, is there another simple HTTP server that can be executed instantly using the command line?"

        "content": "The `SimpleHTTPServer` module in Python 2 and the `http.server` module in Python 3 by default bind to all available interfaces (0.0.0.0), which makes the server accessible from any network interface on your machine, including your VPN interface. To restrict access to localhost only, you need to specify the address when starting the server.\n\nHere's how you can do it in Python 3:\n\n```bash\npython3 -m http.server --bind 127.0.0.1 8000\n```\n\nIn this command, `--bind` specifies the IP address that the server should listen on. By setting it to `127.0.0.1`, you ensure that the server only accepts connections from localhost.\n\nFor Python 2, you can use a different approach because `SimpleHTTPServer` doesn't directly support binding to a specific IP. Instead, you can use the `socketserver` module like this:\n\n```python\nimport SimpleHTTPServer\nimport SocketServer\n\nPORT = 8000\n\nHandler = SimpleHTTPServer.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler\n\nhttpd = SocketServer.TCPServer((\"127.0.0.1\", PORT), Handler)\n\nprint(\"serving at port\", PORT)\nhttpd.serve_forever()\n```\n\nSave this code to a Python file, and run it. It will serve the content on `localhost` only.\n\nIf you want an alternative to Python's SimpleHTTPServer, you can use `http.server` in Python 3, or you can try the `Flask` framework, which is simple to set up for development purposes. Here is a quick example using Flask:\n\n1. Install Flask if you haven't already:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install flask\n   ```\n\n2. Create a simple Flask application:\n\n   ```python\n   from flask import Flask\n\n   app = Flask(__name__)\n\n   @app.route('/')\n   def hello_world():\n       return 'Hello, World!'\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       app.run(host='127.0.0.1', port=8000)\n   ```\n\n3. Run your Flask app:\n\n   ```bash\n   python your_flask_app.py\n   ```\n\nThis will start a server bound to `localhost`, and it will not be accessible from other interfaces."
