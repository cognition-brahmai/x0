I have created a DataFrame in Python using pandas and changed all None values to NaN using numpy. However, I am unable to select or match rows where the value in a specific column is NaN. Here is the code I've used:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame([[1, 2, 3], [3, 4, None]])\n\ndf = df.fillna(np.nan)\n\ndf.iloc[1][2] == np.nan #Returns False\ndf[df[2] == None] #Returns an empty DataFrame\n```"

        "content": "In pandas, when you're dealing with `NaN` values, direct comparisons like `==` don't work as expected because `NaN` is not equal to anything, not even itself. Instead, you should use the `isna()` or `isnull()` function provided by pandas to identify `NaN` values.\n\nHere's how you can select the rows where a specific column has `NaN` values:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create the DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame([[1, 2, 3], [3, 4, None]])\n\n# Replace None with NaN\ndf = df.fillna(np.nan)\n\n# Select rows where the value in column index 2 is NaN\nnan_rows = df[df[2].isna()]\n\nprint(nan_rows)\n```\n\nIn this code, `df[2].isna()` returns a boolean Series where `True` indicates the presence of `NaN` in column index 2. By using this boolean Series to filter `df`, you get only the rows where column index 2 is `NaN`."
