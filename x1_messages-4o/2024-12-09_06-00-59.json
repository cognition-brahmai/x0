        "content": "To work with your own custom text in a similar way to `nltk.book`, you can start by tokenizing your text to split it into words, which also helps in dismissing punctuation if needed. Here's how you can do it using NLTK:\n\n1. **Tokenization**: Convert your string into a list of words.\n2. **Removing Punctuation**: Use a tokenizer that removes punctuation, or manually filter out punctuation after tokenization.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nimport string\n\n# Sample text\nmy_text = \"This is my text, this is a nice way to input text.\"\n\n# Tokenize the text\ntokens = word_tokenize(my_text)\n\n# Remove punctuation\ntokens_without_punctuation = [word for word in tokens if word.isalnum()]\n\n# Alternatively, using string.punctuation\n# tokens_without_punctuation = [word for word in tokens if word not in string.punctuation]\n\nprint(tokens_without_punctuation)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Tokenization**: `word_tokenize` is used to split the text into words and punctuation. You need to download the required NLTK data files if you haven't already by running `nltk.download('punkt')`.\n\n2. **Removing Punctuation**: The list comprehension `[word for word in tokens if word.isalnum()]` filters out any tokens that are not alphanumeric (i.e., it removes punctuation). Alternatively, you can use `string.punctuation` to remove punctuation.\n\n### Additional Steps:\n\n- **Stopwords**: If you also want to remove common words (stopwords) such as \"is\", \"this\", etc., you can do so by using the NLTK stopwords list:\n\n  ```python\n  # Ensure you have downloaded stopwords\n  nltk.download('stopwords')\n  stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n\n  # Remove stopwords\n  filtered_tokens = [word for word in tokens_without_punctuation if word.lower() not in stop_words]\n\n  print(filtered_tokens)\n  ```\n\nThis will give you a list of words from your text without punctuation and common stopwords, making it suitable for further text processing tasks."
