        "content": "The \"database is locked\" error in SQLite typically occurs when a database file is being accessed concurrently by more than one connection, and one of those connections is holding a lock on the database. Here are some potential causes and solutions for this error:\n\n### Causes:\n1. **Long-Running Transactions**: If a transaction is open for a long time without committing or rolling back, it can hold locks that block other operations.\n2. **Concurrent Access**: Multiple parts of your code trying to access the database simultaneously can lead to locking, especially if one connection is writing while others are reading.\n3. **Lack of Connection Management**: Not closing database connections properly can lead to locks remaining on the database.\n4. **Busy Timeout Not Set**: If the database is busy and no timeout has been set, attempts to access it can fail immediately.\n\n### Solutions:\n1. **Commit or Rollback Transactions Promptly**: Ensure that transactions are committed or rolled back as soon as they are no longer needed.\n2. **Use a Connection Pool**: Implement a connection pool to manage database connections efficiently, which can help prevent locks from persisting.\n3. **Review Concurrency in Your Code**: Check for parts of your application that may be accessing the database concurrently and ensure they handle database access properly.\n4. **Set a Busy Timeout**: You can set a busy timeout to make SQLite wait for a specified time before giving up on accessing the database:\n   ```python\n   import sqlite3\n\n   connection = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db', timeout=10)\n   ```\n   This will make SQLite wait for 10 seconds before raising the \"database is locked\" error.\n5. **Close Connections**: Ensure that all database connections are properly closed after their operations are complete.\n6. **Optimize Database Access Patterns**: Refactor your code to minimize the time that locks are held, such as by doing as much computation as possible outside of transactions.\n7. **Use WAL Mode**: Consider using Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mode, which can improve concurrency:\n   ```sql\n   PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;\n   ```\n   Note that WAL mode requires additional considerations, like ensuring the application can handle the increased disk space usage.\n\nBy identifying the specific cause in your application and applying the appropriate solution, you should be able to resolve the \"database is locked\" error."
