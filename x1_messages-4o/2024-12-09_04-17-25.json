Here is my code:\n\n```python\nimport timeit\n\nsetup = \"\"\"\nimport pydash\nlist_of_objs = [\n    {},\n    {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 0: 0},\n    {'a': 1, 'c': 1, 'p': lambda x: x}\n]\n\"\"\"\nprint(timeit.timeit(\"pydash.filter_(list_of_objs, {'a': 1})\", setup=setup))\n```\nThe output I get from this is `11.85382745500101`. How should I interpret this number?"

        "content": "The `timeit.timeit()` function in Python returns the execution time in seconds for the code snippet or function you are timing. The output `11.85382745500101` indicates that the code you are timing took approximately `11.85` seconds to execute.\n\nBy default, the `timeit.timeit()` function runs the code one million times in a loop and returns the total time taken for all those executions. If you want to specify the number of times the code should run, you can use the `number` parameter in the `timeit.timeit()` call. For example, `timeit.timeit(\"pydash.filter_(list_of_objs, {'a': 1})\", setup=setup, number=1000)` will run the code 1000 times and return the total execution time for those 1000 runs.\n\nIf you find the execution time too long, you might want to reduce the `number` of iterations or profile different parts of your code to optimize performance."
