I have tried using the following code but it does not seem to work. Is there a way of doing this in Python, even though there is no wildcard variable?\n\n```python\nimport os, sys\n\npath = \"path/to/dir\"\ndirs = os.listdir(path)\n\nfor file in dirs:\n    if file == '*.csv':\n        print file\n```"

        "content": "Certainly! If you want to list all `.csv` files in a directory, you can use the `os` module in combination with string methods to check the file extensions. The `os.listdir()` function will list all files and directories in a specified path, and then you can filter out the files that end with `.csv`. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\npath = \"path/to/dir\"\ndirs = os.listdir(path)\n\nfor file in dirs:\n    if file.endswith('.csv'):\n        print(file)\n```\n\nThis code will correctly list all files that have a `.csv` extension in the specified directory. If you want to include files in subdirectories, you might consider using `os.walk()` or `glob` module with recursive searching. Here's an example using `os.walk()`:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\npath = \"path/to/dir\"\n\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(path):\n    for file in files:\n        if file.endswith('.csv'):\n            print(os.path.join(root, file))\n```\n\nAnd here's an example using the `glob` module:\n\n```python\nimport glob\n\npath = \"path/to/dir/*.csv\"\n\ncsv_files = glob.glob(path)\n\nfor file in csv_files:\n    print(file)\n```\n\nThese methods will allow you to efficiently list `.csv` files in a directory and optionally its subdirectories."
