        "content": "In Python 2.7, there isn't a direct equivalent to the `usleep()` function as found in C, which pauses execution for a specified number of microseconds. However, you can achieve similar functionality using the `time` module's `sleep()` function.\n\nThe `sleep()` function in Python takes an argument in seconds, but you can specify fractions of a second to achieve microsecond-level delays. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\n# Sleep for 1 microsecond (0.000001 seconds)\ntime.sleep(0.000001)\n```\n\nIf you need to make it more readable and want a function that behaves like `usleep()`, you can define your own function:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef usleep(microseconds):\n    # Convert microseconds to seconds\n    time.sleep(microseconds / 1_000_000.0)\n\n# Usage\nusleep(1)  # Sleep for 1 microsecond\n```\n\nThis custom `usleep()` function allows you to specify the sleep time in microseconds, similar to the C `usleep()` function."
