However, I've encountered an issue where VSCode always stops at the first line of my code during debug, even if there are no breakpoints set. This is becoming quite inconvenient and I'm looking to find a way to skip this automatic stopping at the first line. My environment consists of Code Runner 0.6.5, MagicPython 1.0.3, Python 0.5.5, and Python for VSCode. What solutions could help me with this problem?"

        "content": "The behavior you're experiencing, where Visual Studio Code stops at the first line when you start a debug session, is likely due to the configuration settings in your launch.json file. This file controls how debugging occurs in VSCode for your Python scripts. Here\u2019s how you can adjust your settings to prevent the debugger from stopping at the first line:\n\n1. **Edit the launch.json File**:\n   - Open your project in Visual Studio Code.\n   - Go to the Debug panel by clicking on the debug icon in the Activity Bar on the side of VSCode.\n   - Click on the gear icon to open the launch.json file.\n\n2. **Modify the Configuration**:\n   - In the `launch.json` file, locate the configuration you are using (typically under the `configurations` array).\n   - Add or modify the `stopOnEntry` property to `false`. If it\u2019s not present, you can add it yourself. Here\u2019s an example configuration:\n\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"name\": \"Python: Current File\",\n       \"type\": \"python\",\n       \"request\": \"launch\",\n       \"program\": \"${file}\",\n       \"console\": \"integratedTerminal\",\n       \"stopOnEntry\": false\n     }\n     ```\n\n3. **Check Additional Settings**:\n   - Make sure there are no other settings or extensions that might override this behavior. Sometimes, extensions can add default configurations that might interfere with the debugger settings.\n\n4. **Update Extensions**:\n   - Ensure that all your extensions, especially the Python extension, are up to date. Occasionally, bugs in extensions might cause unexpected behavior, and updates might fix these issues.\n\n5. **Disable Unnecessary Extensions**:\n   - If the problem persists, try disabling other extensions temporarily to see if there\u2019s a conflict causing the issue.\n\n6. **Restart Visual Studio Code**:\n   - After making these changes, restart VSCode to ensure that the new settings take effect.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to prevent Visual Studio Code from stopping at the first line when debugging your Python scripts. If the problem persists, consider checking the VSCode and extension issue trackers for any known bugs or further troubleshooting steps."
