        "content": "To convert a Python program into a standalone executable (.exe) for Windows without using py2exe, you can use several alternative tools that support Python 3. Here are a few popular options:\n\n1. **PyInstaller**:\n   - PyInstaller is a widely used tool that works with Python 3. It analyzes your Python program and bundles it along with its dependencies into a single package.\n   - Installation: You can install PyInstaller using pip: \n     ```bash\n     pip install pyinstaller\n     ```\n   - Usage: To create an executable, navigate to your script's directory and run:\n     ```bash\n     pyinstaller --onefile your_script.py\n     ```\n   - This will generate a standalone executable in the `dist` directory.\n\n2. **cx_Freeze**:\n   - cx_Freeze is another popular tool that works with both Python 2 and Python 3.\n   - Installation: Install it using pip:\n     ```bash\n     pip install cx_Freeze\n     ```\n   - Usage: Create a `setup.py` file for your application:\n     ```python\n     from cx_Freeze import setup, Executable\n\n     setup(\n         name = \"YourAppName\",\n         version = \"0.1\",\n         description = \"Description of your application\",\n         executables = [Executable(\"your_script.py\")]\n     )\n     ```\n   - Then run the following command to build your executable:\n     ```bash\n     python setup.py build\n     ```\n\n3. **PyOxidizer**:\n   - PyOxidizer is a newer tool that can package Python applications into a single executable file.\n   - It's particularly powerful and can even embed the Python interpreter.\n   - Installation and usage can be a bit more involved compared to PyInstaller or cx_Freeze, but it offers additional capabilities.\n   - Detailed documentation and examples are available on the [PyOxidizer website](https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io).\n\n4. **Nuitka**:\n   - Nuitka is a Python-to-C++ compiler that can create standalone executables.\n   - It compiles Python code to C++ and then uses a C++ compiler to create an executable.\n   - Installation: Use pip to install Nuitka:\n     ```bash\n     pip install nuitka\n     ```\n   - Usage: Compile your script with:\n     ```bash\n     nuitka --standalone --onefile your_script.py\n     ```\n\nEach of these tools has its own set of features and configurations, so you may need to explore their documentation to tailor the packaging process to your specific needs."
