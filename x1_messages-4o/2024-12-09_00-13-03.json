Can you provide a code example that demonstrates the logical and mathematical reasoning behind your solution? Additionally, do you have any creative approaches for solving this problem? \nHere is an example Scala code that solves the problem using a greedy approach:\n```scala\ncase class Interval(start: Int, end: Int)\ndef findMinimumSlots(intervals: Seq[Interval]): Int = {\n  val sortedIntervals = intervals.sortBy(_.end)\n  var slots = List.empty[Interval]\n  for (interval <- sortedIntervals) {\n    if (slots.isEmpty || slots.last.end <= interval.start) {\n      slots = slots :+ interval\n    } else {\n      val lastSlot = slots.last\n      val newSlotEnd = math.min(lastSlot.end, interval.end)\n      val newSlot = Interval(lastSlot.start, newSlotEnd)\n      slots = slots.dropRight(1) :+ newSlot\n      if (lastSlot.end < interval.end) {\n        slots = slots :+ interval\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  slots.size\n}\nval intervals = Seq(Interval(1, 3), Interval(2, 4), Interval(3, 5), Interval(4, 6), Interval(5, 7))\nval minSlots = findMinimumSlots(intervals)\nprintln(s\"Minimum slots required: $minSlots\")\n```\nThis code sorts the intervals by their end times and then iterates over them, maintaining a list of time slots. For each interval, it checks if it can be added to the last slot in the list or if it needs to create a new slot. If it creates a new slot, it checks if it can merge it with the last slot in the list. If it can't, it adds the new slot to the list. \nThis approach has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of intervals. A possible creative approach could be to use dynamic programming to solve the problem in O(n^2) time, by considering all possible subsets of intervals and finding the minimum number of slots required to cover each subset."

        "content": "To tackle the problem of finding the minimum number of time slots required to cover a set of intervals, where each slot can only cover a maximum duration of 2 hours, we can employ a greedy algorithm. This approach is efficient and intuitive, leveraging sorting and iterative checking to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n### Greedy Approach with Scala\n\nHere's an enhanced solution using Scala, which respects the constraint of each slot covering a maximum duration of 2 hours:\n\n```scala\ncase class Interval(start: Int, end: Int)\n\ndef findMinimumSlots(intervals: Seq[Interval]): Int = {\n  // Sort intervals by their start time, then by end time for overlapping intervals\n  val sortedIntervals = intervals.sortBy(i => (i.start, i.end))\n\n  // Initialize variables\n  var slots = List.empty[Interval]\n  var currentEnd = 0\n\n  for (interval <- sortedIntervals) {\n    // Check if a new slot is needed\n    if (slots.isEmpty || currentEnd < interval.start) {\n      slots = slots :+ Interval(interval.start, interval.start + 2)\n      currentEnd = interval.start + 2\n    } else {\n      // Extend the current slot if possible\n      if (currentEnd < interval.end) {\n        currentEnd = math.min(currentEnd + 2, interval.end)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  slots.size\n}\n\n// Example usage\nval intervals = Seq(Interval(1, 3), Interval(2, 4), Interval(3, 5), Interval(4, 6), Interval(5, 7))\nval minSlots = findMinimumSlots(intervals)\nprintln(s\"Minimum slots required: $minSlots\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Sorting**: The intervals are sorted by their start time, which helps in efficiently determining the minimum slots needed as we iterate over them.\n\n2. **Slot Management**: We maintain a list of slots, each with a fixed duration of 2 hours. The algorithm checks if the current interval can be accommodated in the existing slots or if a new slot is necessary.\n\n3. **Updating Current End**: As we iterate, the current end of the last slot is updated to ensure it covers as much of the interval as possible without exceeding the 2-hour constraint.\n\n### Creative Approach: Dynamic Programming\n\nWhile the greedy approach is efficient, here's a conceptual outline of a dynamic programming approach, which could theoretically explore all subsets of intervals:\n\n- **State**: Let `dp[i]` represent the minimum number of slots required to cover the first `i` intervals.\n  \n- **Transition**: For each interval `i`, consider extending the slots from previous intervals that can cover `i` without exceeding the 2-hour limit.\n\n- **Initialization**: Start with `dp[0] = 0` (no intervals require 0 slots).\n\n- **Complexity**: This approach would involve checking combinations and might have a time complexity of O(n^2) due to overlapping checks.\n\nThe greedy approach is generally more efficient and preferable for this specific problem due to the clear constraint of each slot having a maximum fixed duration."
