For example, I want to replace every instance of the word 'zero' with '0', 'temp' with 'bob', and 'garbage' with 'nothing'. I initially tried using this code:\n\n```python\nfor line in fileinput.input(fin):\n    fout.write(line.replace('zero', '0'))\n    fout.write(line.replace('temp','bob'))\n    fout.write(line.replace('garbage','nothing'))\n```\nI realize now this might not be the best approach. I also considered using if-statements to check whether the line contains these items and then replace them respectively, but I am not sure if this is the ideal solution. Could anyone suggest the best way to accomplish this task?"

        "content": "You're on the right track with using the `replace` method, but the way it's currently implemented will result in duplicate lines in your output file because you're writing each line three times (once for each replacement). Instead, you should perform all replacements on the same line before writing it to the output file. Here's a more efficient approach:\n\n```python\nimport fileinput\n\n# Open the output file in write mode\nwith open('output.txt', 'w') as fout:\n    # Iterate over each line in the input file\n    for line in fileinput.input('input.txt'):\n        # Perform all replacements on the same line\n        line = line.replace('zero', '0')\n        line = line.replace('temp', 'bob')\n        line = line.replace('garbage', 'nothing')\n        \n        # Write the modified line to the output file\n        fout.write(line)\n```\n\nThis code does the following:\n\n1. Opens the output file in write mode.\n2. Iterates over each line in the input file.\n3. Applies all the replacements on the same line.\n4. Writes the modified line to the output file.\n\nMake sure to replace `'input.txt'` and `'output.txt'` with the paths to your actual input and output files. This approach ensures that each line is processed correctly and only written once to the output file."
