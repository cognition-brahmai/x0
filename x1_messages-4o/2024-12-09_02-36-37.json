        "content": "The error you're encountering, `[Errno 111] Connection refused`, usually indicates that there is no SMTP server running on the specified host and port. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify SMTP Server is Running:**\n   - Ensure that an SMTP server is actually running on your localhost. If not, you need to start one.\n   - You can use a simple SMTP server like `sendmail`, `Postfix`, or `Exim` if you need a full-fledged server.\n   - Alternatively, for testing purposes, you can use Python's built-in SMTP debugging server by running the following command in your terminal:\n     ```bash\n     python -m smtpd -c DebuggingServer -n localhost:1025\n     ```\n   - This will start a simple SMTP server on port 1025 that prints messages to the console.\n\n2. **Check the Port:**\n   - By default, SMTP servers run on port 25. However, the debug server mentioned above runs on port 1025, so you'll need to adjust your code accordingly if you're using it:\n     ```python\n     smtpObj = smtplib.SMTP('localhost', 1025)\n     ```\n\n3. **Firewall and Network Settings:**\n   - Make sure there are no firewall rules or network settings that might be blocking connections to the SMTP port on localhost.\n\n4. **Check for Typographical Errors:**\n   - Ensure there are no typos in the hostname or port number.\n\n5. **Permissions:**\n   - Make sure you have the necessary permissions to run an SMTP server and connect to it.\n\n6. **Use a Different Host:**\n   - If you're testing and do not need to use the localhost, you can use a third-party SMTP service like Gmail or any other that allows SMTP access:\n     ```python\n     smtpObj = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)\n     smtpObj.starttls()\n     smtpObj.login('your-email@gmail.com', 'your-password')\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the connection issue and successfully connect to an SMTP server."
