        "content": "Certainly! To efficiently perform the given operations on the string, we can use data structures that allow fast updates and queries. A combination of a Fenwick Tree (also known as a Binary Indexed Tree) and a frequency array can be useful for this task. Here's a C++ code to perform the operations you described:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <set>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\n// Function to update the Fenwick Tree\nvoid updateFenwickTree(vector<int>& fenwickTree, int index, int value) {\n    int n = fenwickTree.size();\n    for (; index < n; index += index & -index) {\n        fenwickTree[index] += value;\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to get the prefix sum from the Fenwick Tree\nint getPrefixSum(const vector<int>& fenwickTree, int index) {\n    int sum = 0;\n    for (; index > 0; index -= index & -index) {\n        sum += fenwickTree[index];\n    }\n    return sum;\n}\n\n// Function to get the range sum from the Fenwick Tree\nint getRangeSum(const vector<int>& fenwickTree, int left, int right) {\n    return getPrefixSum(fenwickTree, right) - getPrefixSum(fenwickTree, left - 1);\n}\n\n// Function to count distinct characters in a substring\nint countDistinctCharacters(const vector<vector<int>>& charFrequency, int left, int right) {\n    int distinctCount = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {\n        if (getRangeSum(charFrequency[i], left, right) > 0) {\n            ++distinctCount;\n        }\n    }\n    return distinctCount;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    string S;\n    int N, Q;\n    cin >> N >> Q >> S;\n\n    // Fenwick Tree for each character\n    vector<vector<int>> charFrequency(26, vector<int>(N + 1, 0));\n\n    // Initialize the Fenwick Trees with the initial string\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {\n        updateFenwickTree(charFrequency[S[i] - 'a'], i + 1, 1);\n    }\n\n    while (Q--) {\n        int type;\n        cin >> type;\n        if (type == 1) {\n            int left, right;\n            cin >> left >> right;\n            // Query the number of distinct characters in the substring\n            cout << countDistinctCharacters(charFrequency, left, right) << endl;\n        } else if (type == 2) {\n            int pos;\n            cin >> pos;\n            char oldChar = S[pos - 1];\n            char newChar = (oldChar - 'a' + 1) % 26 + 'a';\n            // Update the string and Fenwick Tree\n            updateFenwickTree(charFrequency[oldChar - 'a'], pos, -1);\n            updateFenwickTree(charFrequency[newChar - 'a'], pos, 1);\n            S[pos - 1] = newChar;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Data Structures**: We use a 2D vector `charFrequency` to maintain Fenwick Trees for each character ('a' to 'z'). This allows us to efficiently update character frequencies and query for distinct characters in a substring.\n\n2. **Initialization**: We initialize the Fenwick Trees with the initial string, updating the frequency of each character at its position.\n\n3. **Operations**:\n   - **Query**: For counting distinct characters in a substring, we iterate over each character's Fenwick Tree and check if it has a non-zero frequency in the given range.\n   - **Update**: For replacing a character, we decrease the frequency of the old character and increase the frequency of the new character (the next character in the alphabet).\n\nThis approach ensures efficient updates and queries, making the solution suitable for large inputs."
