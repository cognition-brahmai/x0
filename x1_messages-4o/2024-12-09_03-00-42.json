However, when I ran this demo, I encountered an error stating \"RuntimeError: Failed to process string with tex because latex could not be found\". I am sure I have installed Miktex and Ghostscript required by Matplotlib. Can anyone help me solve this issue? Below is the code I ran and the error traceback I received.\n\nCode:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib\nmatplotlib.rcParams['text.usetex'] = True\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nt = np.linspace(0.0, 1.0, 100)\ns = np.cos(4 * np.pi * t) + 2\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 4), tight_layout=True)\nax.plot(t, s)\n\nax.set_xlabel(r'\\textbf{time (s)}')\nax.set_ylabel('\\\\textit{Velocity (\\N{DEGREE SIGN}/sec)}', fontsize=16)\nax.set_title(r'\\TeX\\ is Number $\\displaystyle\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty'\n             r'\\frac{-e^{i\\pi}}{2^n}$!', fontsize=16, color='r')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nError Traceback:\n```python\nRuntimeError: Failed to process string with tex because latex could not be found\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that Matplotlib is unable to find the LaTeX installation on your system, even though you've installed MikTeX and Ghostscript. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify LaTeX Installation**:\n   - Ensure that MikTeX is installed correctly and is functioning. You can test this by trying to compile a simple LaTeX document from the command line, using a command like `pdflatex sample.tex`.\n\n2. **Check System Path**:\n   - Make sure that the path to the LaTeX executables (e.g., `pdflatex`) is included in your system's PATH environment variable. You can check this by running `pdflatex --version` in your command prompt or terminal. If it doesn't return a version number, you'll need to add the directory containing `pdflatex` to your PATH.\n\n3. **Update MikTeX**:\n   - Open the MikTeX console and ensure that all packages are up-to-date. Sometimes, missing or outdated packages can cause issues.\n\n4. **Configure Matplotlib**:\n   - You can explicitly specify the path to the LaTeX executable in the Matplotlib configuration file. Open the Matplotlib configuration file, usually located at `~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc` (Linux/Mac) or `%USERPROFILE%\\.matplotlib\\matplotlibrc` (Windows), and add or modify the following line:\n     ```\n     text.latex.preamble : \\usepackage{amsmath}\n     ```\n   - Additionally, you can specify the path to the LaTeX executable by adding:\n     ```\n     text.latex.preamble : \n     text.latex.unicode : True\n     ```\n\n5. **Install Required Packages**:\n   - Ensure that you have the necessary LaTeX packages installed, such as `amsmath`, `amsfonts`, and `amssymb`. You can install them via the MikTeX package manager.\n\n6. **Check Ghostscript Installation**:\n   - Make sure Ghostscript is properly installed and accessible from the command line. You can check this by running `gs --version`.\n\n7. **Test with a Simple Example**:\n   - Try running a simpler example to see if the issue persists. For example:\n     ```python\n     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n     plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1])\n     plt.title(r'$\\alpha > \\beta$')\n     plt.show()\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and fix the issue preventing Matplotlib from using LaTeX. If the problem persists, consider checking online forums or the Matplotlib GitHub issues page for more specific advice related to your environment."
