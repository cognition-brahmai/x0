This warning appears for files that exist in the document because they've been explicitly included. For instance, in my index file, I have:\n```\n.. toctree::\n    :maxdepth: 2\n\n   pages/0010-foo\n   pages/0020-bar\n```\nand in the file 0020-bar.rst, I'm specifically including a number of other files, such as:\n```\n.. contents:: :local:\n\n.. include:: /pages/reference-architecture/technical-considerations/0070-baz.rst\n```\nHowever, when I build the project, I still get a warning that 0070-baz.rst isn't in any toctree:\n```\n/home/nick/Documents/myProject/docs/pages/reference-architecture/technical-considerations/0070-baz.rst:: WARNING: document isn't included in any toctree\n```\nI can see the content in the output, so is this warning normal? Does it always appear for files that are explicitly included rather than included via toctree?"

        "content": "The warning you're encountering, \"WARNING: document isn't included in any toctree,\" is related to how Sphinx handles document inclusion. This warning appears because Sphinx is designed to organize documents in a hierarchy using a toctree, and it expects all documents to be part of this structure. When files are included using the `.. include::` directive, they are inserted directly into the document, but Sphinx doesn't consider them part of the toctree hierarchy.\n\nHere are a few considerations and solutions to address this warning:\n\n1. **Purpose of the `.. include::` Directive**:\n   - The `.. include::` directive is used to insert the content of one file into another. It's useful for reusing content across multiple documents.\n   - However, it doesn't add the included document to the toctree. Therefore, Sphinx generates a warning because it doesn't see the included document as part of the navigable structure.\n\n2. **Suppressing the Warning**:\n   - If you want to suppress the warning because it's not affecting your output and you intentionally used `.. include::`, you can adjust your Sphinx configuration:\n     - Add `suppress_warnings = ['toc.not_read']` to your `conf.py` file. This will suppress the toctree warnings.\n\n3. **Including in Toctree**:\n   - If you want to include the document in the toctree and avoid the warning, you should add it to a toctree directive. You can create a dedicated page that includes the document using `.. include::`, and then link that page in the toctree.\n\n4. **Alternative Approaches**:\n   - If the document is a standalone page and should be part of the navigation, consider restructuring your documentation so it can be directly linked in the toctree.\n   - Alternatively, if the included content is supplementary and doesn't need to be navigable on its own, you can keep using `.. include::` and suppress the warning as mentioned.\n\nUltimately, whether to suppress the warning or restructure your documentation depends on how you want users to navigate and interact with your documentation. If the content is successfully included and displayed as intended, and the warning doesn't impact your final document structure, you may choose to suppress it if you find it unnecessary."
