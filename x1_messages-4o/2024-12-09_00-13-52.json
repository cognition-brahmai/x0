        "content": "Certainly! You're already on the right track with your Ruby code. I'll provide a step-by-step explanation along with the code to calculate the number of sheets each student received.\n\nHere's the Ruby code with detailed steps:\n\n```ruby\n# Step 1: Define the total number of sheets of paper\ntotal_sheets = 60\n\n# Step 2: Define the number of students in the class\nnum_students = 20\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the number of sheets each student receives\n# This is done by dividing the total number of sheets by the number of students\nsheets_per_student = total_sheets / num_students\n\n# Step 4: Output the result\nputs \"Each student received #{sheets_per_student} sheets of paper.\"\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n1. We start by assigning the total number of sheets (`60`) to the variable `total_sheets`.\n2. We then assign the number of students (`20`) to the variable `num_students`.\n3. To find out how many sheets each student received, we divide `total_sheets` by `num_students` and store the result in `sheets_per_student`.\n4. Finally, we use `puts` to print the result, which shows how many sheets each student received.\n\nRunning this Ruby script will output:\n```\nEach student received 3 sheets of paper.\n```\n\nThis calculation shows that each student receives 3 sheets of paper when 60 sheets are distributed among 20 students."
