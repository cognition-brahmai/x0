For example, if someone saves $500 each month for 2 years with an annual interest rate of 5%, what will be their total savings at the end of the period? Please use a compound interest formula in your code."

        "content": "Certainly! To calculate the total savings with compound interest, we'll use the formula for future value of a series of cash flows:\n\n\\[ FV = P \\times \\left(\\frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r}\\right) \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( FV \\) is the future value of the investment.\n- \\( P \\) is the monthly savings amount.\n- \\( r \\) is the monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12).\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of months.\n\nHere's the Python code to calculate the total savings:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_total_savings(monthly_savings, years, annual_interest_rate):\n    # Convert annual interest rate to a monthly interest rate\n    monthly_interest_rate = annual_interest_rate / 12 / 100\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of months\n    total_months = years * 12\n    \n    # Calculate future value using the compound interest formula for a series\n    future_value = monthly_savings * (((1 + monthly_interest_rate) ** total_months - 1) / monthly_interest_rate)\n    \n    return future_value\n\n# Example usage\nmonthly_savings = 500  # Amount saved each month\nyears = 2  # Number of years\nannual_interest_rate = 5  # Annual interest rate in percent\n\ntotal_savings = calculate_total_savings(monthly_savings, years, annual_interest_rate)\nprint(f\"Total savings after {years} years: ${total_savings:.2f}\")\n```\n\nThis code will calculate and print the total savings after 2 years, given a monthly saving of $500 and an annual interest rate of 5%. You can adjust the `monthly_savings`, `years`, and `annual_interest_rate` variables for different scenarios."
