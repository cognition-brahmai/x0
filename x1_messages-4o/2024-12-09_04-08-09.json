I tried using the `round()` function in Python like this `round(8.8333333333333339, 2)`, but it gives me 8.83 instead of 8.84. I require the result not as a string but as a number for further use. Being new to Python and programming in general, I'm not certain how to achieve this. Can someone please help me with this problem?"

        "content": "To achieve the rounding up of a floating point number to the next decimal place in Python, you can use the `math.ceil()` function in combination with some arithmetic operations. The `round()` function performs rounding to the nearest value, which is why it is not giving the result you expect. Instead, you can multiply the number by a power of 10, apply `math.ceil()`, and then divide by the same power of 10 to get the desired result. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef round_up(number, decimals=2):\n    factor = 10 ** decimals\n    return math.ceil(number * factor) / factor\n\nresult = round_up(8.8333333333333339, 2)\nprint(result)  # Output will be 8.84\n```\n\nThis function `round_up()` multiplies the number by 10 raised to the power of the desired decimal places (`decimals`), applies `math.ceil()` to round up to the nearest integer, and then divides by the same power of 10 to move the decimal point back to its original position. This will give you the desired rounding up behavior for floating-point numbers."
