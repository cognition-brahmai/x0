        "content": "Yes, absolutely! The Tower of Hanoi is a classic problem that can be solved using a recursive algorithm. The problem consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks neatly stacked in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest disk at the top, making a conical shape. The objective is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:\n\n1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.\n3. No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n\nHere's a simple recursive algorithm written in Java to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle:\n\n```java\npublic class TowerOfHanoi {\n\n    // Recursive method to solve Tower of Hanoi puzzle\n    public static void solveHanoi(int n, char source, char destination, char auxiliary) {\n        // Base case: If there's only 1 disk, move it from source to destination\n        if (n == 1) {\n            System.out.println(\"Move disk 1 from \" + source + \" to \" + destination);\n            return;\n        }\n        // Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary, so they are out of the way\n        solveHanoi(n - 1, source, auxiliary, destination);\n        // Move the nth disk from source to destination\n        System.out.println(\"Move disk \" + n + \" from \" + source + \" to \" + destination);\n        // Move the n-1 disks that we left on auxiliary to destination\n        solveHanoi(n - 1, auxiliary, destination, source);\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int numberOfDisks = 3; // Example: 3 disks\n        solveHanoi(numberOfDisks, 'A', 'C', 'B'); // A, B and C are names of rods\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Parameters**: The `solveHanoi` method takes four parameters: the number of disks `n`, and the names of the three rods `source`, `destination`, and `auxiliary`.\n  \n- **Base Case**: If there is only one disk, it is moved directly from the source rod to the destination rod.\n\n- **Recursive Case**: \n  - Move `n-1` disks from the source rod to the auxiliary rod using the destination rod.\n  - Move the nth disk directly to the destination rod.\n  - Move the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary rod to the destination rod using the source rod.\n\nThis algorithm has a time complexity of O(2^n), where n is the number of disks, because for each disk, the algorithm calls itself twice, reducing the problem by one disk each time."
