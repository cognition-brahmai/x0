I've tried using the `contains` filter, but it seems to be designed for use with strings. How should I filter this relation? Here's the function attached to the user profile:\n\n```python\ndef getVisiblePackages(self):\n    visiblePackages = {}   \n    for product in self.products.all():\n        moduleDict = {}\n        for module in product.module_set.all():\n            pkgList = []\n            involvedStatus = module.workflow_set.filter(trigger_roles__contains=self.role.id, allowed=True).values_list('current_state', flat=True)\n```\nAnd my simplified workflow model looks like this:\n\n```python\nclass Workflow(models.Model):\n    module = models.ForeignKey(Module)\n    current_state = models.ForeignKey(Status)\n    next_state = models.ForeignKey(Status)\n    allowed = models.BooleanField(default=False)\n    involved_roles = models.ManyToManyField(Role, blank=True, null=True)\n    trigger_roles = models.ManyToManyField(Role, blank=True, null=True)\n```"

        "content": "To filter objects through a many-to-many relationship in Django, you should use the double underscore (`__`) syntax to traverse relationships and filter based on fields of related models. In your case, you want to filter `Workflow` objects by checking if a related `Role` is in the `trigger_roles` many-to-many relationship.\n\nInstead of using `contains`, which is typically for checking substrings in fields like `CharField` or `TextField`, you can use `filter` in combination with the `__in` lookup to filter by the presence of a related object. Here's how you can modify your query:\n\n```python\ndef getVisiblePackages(self):\n    visiblePackages = {}   \n    for product in self.products.all():\n        moduleDict = {}\n        for module in product.module_set.all():\n            pkgList = []\n            # Use the 'filter' method with '__in' to filter many-to-many relationships\n            involvedStatus = module.workflow_set.filter(\n                trigger_roles__in=[self.role],  # Use '__in' to check presence in many-to-many field\n                allowed=True\n            ).values_list('current_state', flat=True)\n            # Add this list to the package list or perform further processing\n            pkgList.extend(involvedStatus)\n            \n            # Add the module and its package list to the module dictionary\n            moduleDict[module] = pkgList\n        \n        # Add the module dictionary to the visible packages dictionary\n        visiblePackages[product] = moduleDict\n\n    return visiblePackages\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`trigger_roles__in=[self.role]`**: This is the key change. It checks if the user's role is among the `trigger_roles` associated with each `Workflow` object. The `__in` lookup is used to filter objects where a field's value is in a given list.\n- **`allowed=True`**: This ensures that the filter only includes workflows that are allowed, as per your original logic.\n- This approach will effectively filter the `Workflow` objects based on whether the user's role is present in the `trigger_roles` many-to-many field.\n\nMake sure that your `Role` model and `self.role` are correctly defined and that `self.role` is an instance of the `Role` model. Adjust the logic if `self.role` might be a list of roles or another type."
