I tried comparing the response object with \"<Response [200]>\", but it doesn't seem to be working. Even when the output shows \"Response [200]\", my check in the if statement doesn't match. Here is the code I am using:\n\n```\nresp = requests.post(my_endpoint_var, headers=header_var, data=post_data_var)\nprint(resp)\nif resp == \"<Response [200]>\":\n    print ('OK!')\nelse:\n    print ('Boo!')\n```\nThe output on the screen is:\n\n```\nResponse [200] (including the \"<\" and \">\")\nBoo!\n```\n\nWhy is my if statement not matching the \"200 OK\" response?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that you're trying to compare the response object `resp` directly with the string `\"<Response [200]>\"`. In Python, the `print(resp)` statement calls the `__str__` method of the response object, which returns a string representation of the response, but this does not mean that `resp` itself is a string.\n\nInstead, you should be checking the `status_code` attribute of the response object to determine if the request was successful. The status code `200` indicates that the request was successful. Here's how you can modify your code to perform the check correctly:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\nresp = requests.post(my_endpoint_var, headers=header_var, data=post_data_var)\nprint(resp)\n\nif resp.status_code == 200:\n    print('OK!')\nelse:\n    print('Boo!')\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, the `if` statement checks if `resp.status_code` is equal to `200`, which correctly determines if the HTTP response was successful."
