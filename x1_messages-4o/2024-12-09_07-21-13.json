Additionally, LaTeX commands like r'$\\bf \\phi$' and r'$\\mathbf{\\phi}$' don't have any effect either. Is there a way to make the '$\\phi$' in my axis label bold?"

        "content": "To apply bold font weight to a LaTeX-styled axes label in Matplotlib, you can use the `\\boldsymbol` command from the `amsmath` package. First, you need to ensure that Matplotlib is set to use LaTeX for text rendering. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Enable LaTeX for text rendering.\n2. Use `\\boldsymbol` to make the LaTeX math symbols bold.\n\nHere's an example of how you can apply bold font weight to the `$\\phi$` character in your axis label:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Enable LaTeX for text rendering\nplt.rc('text', usetex=True)\nplt.rc('font', family='serif')\n\n# Sample data\nx = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)\ny = np.sin(x)\n\n# Plot\nplt.plot(x, y)\n\n# Apply bold font weight to the axes labels\nplt.xlabel(r'$\\boldsymbol{\\phi}$')\nplt.ylabel(r'$\\boldsymbol{\\psi}$')\n\nplt.title(r'Bold Font in LaTeX with $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\psi}$')\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this example, `\\boldsymbol` is used to make the `$\\phi$` symbol bold. Make sure that your LaTeX distribution is installed and properly configured, as Matplotlib relies on it to render LaTeX text."
