However, I am forced to use Python's standard \"list\" object to save this data. I attempted a workaround by converting the deque object into a list using a for loop, but this seems suboptimal. Is there a more efficient way of converting a deque object into a list in Python? Here's the workaround code I used:\n\n```python\ndequeObj = deque(myData)\nmy_list= list()\nfor obj in dequeObj:\n    my_list.append(obj)\n```"

        "content": "Yes, there's a more efficient and direct way to convert a `deque` object into a list in Python. You can simply use the `list()` constructor directly on the `deque` object. This is both more concise and efficient than iterating over the `deque` and appending each element individually. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Assuming myData is already defined and contains your data\ndequeObj = deque(myData)\nmy_list = list(dequeObj)\n```\n\nThis approach leverages Python's built-in ability to convert iterable objects to lists directly, making your code cleaner and potentially more performant."
