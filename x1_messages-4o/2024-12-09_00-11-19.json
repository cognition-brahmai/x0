Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to retrieve the latest news headline and summary about climate change using the following JSON data:\n{\n  \"news\": [\n    {\n      \"headline\": \"New Climate Change Report Warns of Dire Consequences Without Drastic Action\",\n      \"summary\": \"The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that global warming is widespread, rapidly intensifying, and likely irreversible. Urgent and unprecedented action is needed to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"headline\": \"World Leaders Meet to Discuss Climate Change Policies\",\n      \"summary\": \"Representatives from over 190 countries have gathered for the United Nations Climate Change Conference to discuss ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. The conference comes amid growing concerns about the impacts of global warming on vulnerable populations and ecosystems.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"headline\": \"Scientists Find Evidence of Rapid Climate Change in Antarctica\",\n      \"summary\": \"A team of researchers has discovered that the Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica is melting at an alarming rate due to rising temperatures caused by climate change. The glacier is a key contributor to sea level rise, and its collapse could lead to catastrophic consequences for coastal cities and communities.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nBut wait, there's a catch! You must first solve a puzzle to determine which article is the latest. The puzzle is as follows:\nYou have three jars, labeled A, B, and C. Jar A contains enough water to fill two glasses, jar B contains enough water to fill five glasses, and jar C contains enough water to fill seven glasses. Your task is to measure exactly four glasses of water using these jars. What is the minimum number of steps required to achieve this goal?\nOnce you have solved the puzzle, you can use the answer to determine which article is the latest and display its headline and summary in a clear and visually appealing way on your HTML page. Good luck!"

        "content": "To solve the puzzle of measuring exactly four glasses of water using the jars, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Start with Jar C**: Fill it completely. Jar C contains enough water to fill seven glasses.\n2. **Pour water from Jar C to Jar B**: Pour water from Jar C into Jar B until Jar B is full. Since Jar B holds five glasses, after this step, Jar C will have 2 glasses of water left (7 - 5 = 2).\n3. **Empty Jar B**: Pour all the water from Jar B out. Now, Jar B is empty.\n4. **Transfer from Jar C to Jar B**: Pour the 2 glasses of water remaining in Jar C into Jar B. Now, Jar B has 2 glasses of water.\n5. **Refill Jar C**: Fill Jar C again. Now, Jar C has 7 glasses again.\n6. **Pour from Jar C to Jar B**: Pour water from Jar C into Jar B until Jar B is full. Since Jar B already has 2 glasses, you can only add 3 more glasses to fill it (5 total). After this, Jar C will have 4 glasses left (7 - 3 = 4).\n\nNow, you have exactly four glasses of water in Jar C. This process requires six steps.\n\nSince the minimum number of steps needed to measure exactly four glasses is six, the sixth article in the list is the latest. However, because there are only three articles in the JSON data provided, this puzzle solution is more theoretical than practical for selecting an article. Assuming the intention is to select based on the number of steps, let's proceed with displaying the latest article as the third one since it involves the highest numbers:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Climate Change News</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n            background-color: #f4f4f9;\n            color: #333;\n            padding: 20px;\n        }\n        .article {\n            border: 1px solid #ccc;\n            padding: 20px;\n            margin-bottom: 20px;\n            background-color: #fff;\n            border-radius: 5px;\n            box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n        }\n        .headline {\n            font-size: 1.5em;\n            margin-bottom: 10px;\n        }\n        .summary {\n            font-size: 1em;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div class=\"article\">\n        <div class=\"headline\">Scientists Find Evidence of Rapid Climate Change in Antarctica</div>\n        <div class=\"summary\">A team of researchers has discovered that the Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica is melting at an alarming rate due to rising temperatures caused by climate change.
