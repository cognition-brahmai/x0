        "content": "Your Swift code snippet correctly calculates the total nutritional information for a 591 ml bottle based on the given serving size and nutritional values. Let's break down the code and ensure it works as intended:\n\n```swift\nlet servingSize: Double = 355\nlet caloriesPerServing: Double = 140\nlet sugarPerServing: Double = 39\nlet bottleSize: Double = 591\n\nlet servingsPerBottle = bottleSize / servingSize\nlet totalCalories = servingsPerBottle * caloriesPerServing\nlet totalSugar = servingsPerBottle * sugarPerServing\n\nprint(\"If you were to consume a \\(bottleSize) ml bottle, you would consume \\(totalCalories) calories and \\(totalSugar) grams of sugar.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Variables Initialization**:\n   - `servingSize` is the volume of a standard serving of the beverage (355 ml).\n   - `caloriesPerServing` is the number of calories per serving (140 calories).\n   - `sugarPerServing` is the amount of sugar per serving (39 grams).\n   - `bottleSize` is the volume of the bottle you are interested in (591 ml).\n\n2. **Calculations**:\n   - `servingsPerBottle` calculates how many servings are in the bottle by dividing the `bottleSize` by the `servingSize`.\n   - `totalCalories` calculates the total calories in the bottle by multiplying the number of servings by the calories per serving.\n   - `totalSugar` calculates the total sugar in the bottle by multiplying the number of servings by the sugar per serving.\n\n3. **Output**:\n   - The `print` statement outputs the total calories and sugar content for the given bottle size.\n\n### Result:\nWhen you run this code, it will output the total calories and sugar for the 591 ml bottle. You should get approximately:\n\n- **Total Calories**: 233.5\n- **Total Sugar**: 64.85 grams\n\nFeel free to adjust the values if you have different nutritional information or bottle sizes."
