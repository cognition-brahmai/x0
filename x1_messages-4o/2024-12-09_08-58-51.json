        "content": "Certainly! Below is a simple Python function that allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This function will prompt the user to enter two numbers and select an operation, then it will display the result.\n\n```python\ndef calculator():\n    def add(x, y):\n        return x + y\n\n    def subtract(x, y):\n        return x - y\n\n    def multiply(x, y):\n        return x * y\n\n    def divide(x, y):\n        if y == 0:\n            return \"Error! Division by zero.\"\n        return x / y\n\n    print(\"Select operation:\")\n    print(\"1. Add\")\n    print(\"2. Subtract\")\n    print(\"3. Multiply\")\n    print(\"4. Divide\")\n\n    while True:\n        choice = input(\"Enter choice(1/2/3/4): \")\n\n        if choice in ('1', '2', '3', '4'):\n            try:\n                num1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n                num2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n            except ValueError:\n                print(\"Invalid input. Please enter numeric values.\")\n                continue\n\n            if choice == '1':\n                print(f\"{num1} + {num2} = {add(num1, num2)}\")\n\n            elif choice == '2':\n                print(f\"{num1} - {num2} = {subtract(num1, num2)}\")\n\n            elif choice == '3':\n                print(f\"{num1} * {num2} = {multiply(num1, num2)}\")\n\n            elif choice == '4':\n                print(f\"{num1} / {num2} = {divide(num1, num2)}\")\n\n            next_calculation = input(\"Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): \")\n            if next_calculation.lower() != 'yes':\n                break\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please choose a valid operation.\")\n\ncalculator()\n```\n\n### How it works:\n1. The `calculator` function defines four inner functions to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n2. It prompts the user to select an operation.\n3. It checks for valid user input and performs the selected arithmetic operation using the two numbers provided by the user.\n4. The result is displayed, and the user is asked if they want to perform another calculation.\n5. The process repeats until the user decides to stop.\n\nYou can run this function in a Python environment to perform basic calculations."
