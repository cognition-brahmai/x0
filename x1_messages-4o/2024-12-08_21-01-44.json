Here's how you can insert a formula in Microsoft Word using the Equation Editor:\n\n1. **Open Microsoft Word**: Start by opening the document where you want to insert your formula.\n\n2. **Navigate to the Insert Tab**: Click on the \"Insert\" tab in the Ribbon at the top of the window.\n\n3. **Select Equation**: In the \"Symbols\" group, click on \"Equation\". A dropdown will appear, and you can either choose a pre-defined equation or click \"Insert New Equation\" at the bottom.\n\n4. **Equation Editor**: Once you click on \"Insert New Equation\", a new equation box will appear within your document, along with the \"Equation\" tab in the Ribbon.\n\n5. **Enter the Formula**: You can now type your formula directly into the equation box. You can use the buttons in the \"Equation\" tab to insert symbols and structures. If you prefer using LaTeX, you can type your formula using LaTeX syntax by starting with a backslash `\\`.\n\n6. **Example in LaTeX**: Let's say you want to insert the quadratic formula. You would type:\n\n   ```latex\n   x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n   ```\n\n   Make sure to type this within the equation editor box.\n\n7. **Format and Adjust**: Use the tools available in the \"Equation\" tab to format your equation as needed. You can adjust the size, add brackets, and more.\n\n8. **Close the Equation Editor**: Click outside the equation box to exit the equation editor once you're done.\n\nThat's it! You've now inserted a formula into your Word document using the equation editor. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
