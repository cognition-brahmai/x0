Our project structure is typically as follows:\n\n```\n/project-name\n  /src\n    /django-project-name\n      etc..\nreadme.md\nrequirements.txt\n```\n\nWhen I open `/project-name` instead of `/django-project-name` in PyCharm, it underlines my imports and says it can't find them. It tries to reference imports as `src.django-project-name.app_name.models.Thing`, which doesn't work when running Django. How can I configure PyCharm to work as if I had opened `/django-project-name`, so it correctly handles these paths?"

        "content": "To resolve the issue with import paths in PyCharm for your Django project, you can adjust the configuration so that PyCharm treats the `/src` directory as the source root. This will help PyCharm recognize the imports correctly. Here\u2019s how you can do that:\n\n1. **Open the Correct Directory**: Make sure you open the `/project-name` directory in PyCharm, as you want the entire project to be accessible.\n\n2. **Mark the Source Root**:\n   - In the Project tool window (usually on the left side), right-click on the `/src` directory.\n   - Select `Mark Directory as` -> `Sources Root`.\n   - This tells PyCharm to treat `/src` as the starting point for finding modules.\n\n3. **Check the Python Interpreter**:\n   - Go to `File` -> `Settings` (or `PyCharm` -> `Preferences` on macOS).\n   - Navigate to `Project: <your-project-name>` -> `Python Interpreter`.\n   - Ensure the interpreter is correctly set to the one you are using for your Django project. If it's not, configure it to use the correct virtual environment or Python interpreter.\n\n4. **Configure Django Support**:\n   - Go to `File` -> `Settings`.\n   - Navigate to `Languages & Frameworks` -> `Django`.\n   - Ensure Django support is enabled and the settings file is correctly specified.\n\n5. **Adjust Django Settings**:\n   - Within the Django settings in PyCharm, make sure the \"Settings\" dropdown is pointing to your `settings.py` file within the `/django-project-name` directory.\n\n6. **Check Environment Variables**:\n   - If you're using environment variables to manage your Django settings, make sure they are set correctly in the run configurations.\n   - Go to `Run` -> `Edit Configurations`.\n   - Select your Django server configuration and ensure the environment variables are set up correctly, especially `PYTHONPATH` if needed.\n\nBy marking the `/src` directory as a source root, PyCharm should now recognize the import paths correctly, resolving issues with underlined imports. This should align with how Django manages paths when running your project. If you continue to face issues, double-check that there are no typos or misconfigurations in your import statements and settings."
