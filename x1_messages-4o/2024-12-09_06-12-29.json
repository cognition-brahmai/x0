The dataframe, `dfc` is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\ntrial_num = [1,2,3,4,5]\nsail_rem_time = ['11:33:11','16:29:05','09:37:56','21:43:31','17:42:06']\ndfc = pd.DataFrame(zip(*[trial_num,sail_rem_time]),columns=['Temp_Reading','Time_of_Sail'])\n```\n\nThe dataframe looks like this:\n\n```python\n  Temp_Reading Time_of_Sail\n             1     11:33:11\n             2     16:29:05\n             3     09:37:56\n             4     21:43:31\n             5     17:42:06\n```\n\nWhen I check the data types of the columns with `print dfc.dtypes`, it shows me that the column `Time_of_Sail` has a datatype of `object`. I want to convert this column to `datetime` datatype but I only want to keep the time part - I don't want the year, month, date.\n\nI tried the following code:\n\n```python\ndfc['Time_of_Sail'] = pd.to_datetime(dfc['Time_of_Sail'])\ndfc['Time_of_Sail'] = [time.time() for time in dfc['Time_of_Sail']]\n```\n\nHowever, when I check the data type of the `Time_of_Sail` column after running this code, it still shows `object`. How can I convert this column into a datetime format that only has the time?"

        "content": "In Python 2.7 with Pandas, you can convert a column of time strings into a `datetime` type by parsing the strings correctly. However, Pandas does not natively support time-only `datetime` objects, so the `datetime` objects will include a default date. \n\nIf you only want to handle the time portion, you could still convert the times to `datetime.time` objects, but keep in mind that these objects are inherently treated as `object` type in Pandas. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Your existing data\ntrial_num = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nsail_rem_time = ['11:33:11', '16:29:05', '09:37:56', '21:43:31', '17:42:06']\ndfc = pd.DataFrame(zip(trial_num, sail_rem_time), columns=['Temp_Reading', 'Time_of_Sail'])\n\n# Convert to datetime and extract time\ndfc['Time_of_Sail'] = pd.to_datetime(dfc['Time_of_Sail'], format='%H:%M:%S').dt.time\n\n# Check the DataFrame\nprint(dfc)\nprint(dfc.dtypes)\n```\n\nThis code will:\n\n1. Parse the `Time_of_Sail` strings into `datetime` objects using `pd.to_datetime()`.\n2. Extract the time portion using the `.dt.time` accessor, which results in Python `datetime.time` objects.\n\nHowever, as noted earlier, the `time` objects are treated as `object` dtype in Pandas because Pandas does not have a native time-only dtype. This is the correct way to work with time-only data in Pandas for your use case."
