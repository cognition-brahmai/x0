        "content": "The most efficient way to calculate the sum of three numbers in JavaScript is straightforward, using a simple arithmetic operation. You can just add the three numbers directly. Here's a basic example:\n\n```javascript\nfunction sumOfThreeNumbers(a, b, c) {\n    return a + b + c;\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst result = sumOfThreeNumbers(5, 10, 15);\nconsole.log(result); // Output: 30\n```\n\nThis function takes three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`, and returns their sum. JavaScript handles the arithmetic operation efficiently, so this method is both simple and performant."
