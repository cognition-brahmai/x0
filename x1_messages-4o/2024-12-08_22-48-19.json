        "content": "IF statements are fundamental control structures in programming that allow you to execute certain blocks of code based on conditions. The variations of IF statements generally serve the same purpose but offer flexibility in handling different scenarios. Here's an overview of the different types of IF statements commonly found in programming languages, along with examples of their use:\n\n1. **Simple IF Statement:**\n   - **Functionality:** Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.\n   - **Use Case:** Use when you need to perform an action based on a single condition.\n   - **Example:** Checking if a user is logged in.\n\n     ```python\n     if is_logged_in:\n         print(\"Welcome back!\")\n     ```\n\n2. **IF-ELSE Statement:**\n   - **Functionality:** Provides an alternative block of code to execute if the condition is false.\n   - **Use Case:** Use when you need to choose between two actions.\n   - **Example:** Determining if a number is positive or negative.\n\n     ```python\n     if number >= 0:\n         print(\"Positive number\")\n     else:\n         print(\"Negative number\")\n     ```\n\n3. **IF-ELIF-ELSE Statement:**\n   - **Functionality:** Allows multiple conditions to be tested sequentially. Executes the first block where the condition is true.\n   - **Use Case:** Use when you need to check multiple conditions.\n   - **Example:** Grading system based on score ranges.\n\n     ```python\n     if score >= 90:\n         grade = 'A'\n     elif score >= 80:\n         grade = 'B'\n     elif score >= 70:\n         grade = 'C'\n     else:\n         grade = 'D'\n     ```\n\n4. **Nested IF Statement:**\n   - **Functionality:** An IF statement inside another IF statement. Useful for checking multiple conditions that depend on previous ones.\n   - **Use Case:** Use when decisions depend on prior conditions.\n   - **Example:** Checking user access based on role and status.\n\n     ```python\n     if user_role == \"admin\":\n         if active_status:\n             print(\"Access granted\")\n         else:\n             print(\"Activate your account\")\n     else:\n         print(\"Access denied\")\n     ```\n\n5. **Switch (or Case) Statement:**\n   - **Functionality:** An alternative to multiple IF-ELIF statements. It executes a block of code based on the value of a variable.\n   - **Use Case:** Use when you have a single variable to evaluate against multiple possible values.\n   - **Example:** Menu selection based on user input.\n\n     ```python\n     switch (choice) {\n         case 1:\n             print(\"Start game\")\n             break;\n         case 2:\n             print(\"Load game\")\n             break;\n         case 3:\n             print(\"Quit\")\n             break;\n         default:\n             print(\"Invalid choice\")\n     }\n     ```\n\n   (Note: Not all programming languages support switch statements; they're common in languages like C, Java, JavaScript, and PHP.)\n\nEach type of IF statement provides a different level of control and readability, suited to varying logical requirements in your code. Choosing the right one depends on the specific scenario and the complexity of the conditions you need to evaluate."
