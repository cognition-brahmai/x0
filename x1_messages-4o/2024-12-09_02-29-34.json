By gem/git style, I mean that with no arguments, the output tells you how you can proceed, and there is a special \"help\" command which gets you deeper tips about the \"branch\" command. The module should do usage printing for you, exit with invalid input, and run your functions according to your CLI specification, sort of like a \"URL mapper\" for the command line."

        "content": "Yes, there are several Python modules that can help you create command-line interfaces (CLI) with features similar to those found in tools like `gem` or `git`. One of the most popular modules for this purpose is `argparse`, which comes built-in with Python. However, `argparse` might require some manual setup to achieve the exact functionality you're describing. For more advanced or specific features like subcommands (similar to `git` or `gem`), you might want to consider using a third-party library like `Click` or `argparse` with subparsers.\n\nHere's a brief overview of how you can achieve this using both `Click` and `argparse`:\n\n### Using Click\n\n`Click` is a Python package that is designed to make it easy to create command-line interfaces. It supports the style of CLI you are describing, with subcommands and automatic help messages.\n\n1. **Installation**: First, you need to install Click using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install click\n   ```\n\n2. **Example Script**:\n\n   ```python\n   import click\n\n   @click.group()\n   def cli():\n       \"\"\"A simple CLI tool\"\"\"\n       pass\n\n   @cli.command()\n   def start():\n       \"\"\"Start the process.\"\"\"\n       click.echo('Starting the process...')\n\n   @cli.command()\n   def stop():\n       \"\"\"Stop the process.\"\"\"\n       click.echo('Stopping the process...')\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       cli()\n   ```\n\n   When you run the script without any arguments, it will display the available commands. You can also use `--help` to get more detailed help for each command.\n\n### Using argparse with Subparsers\n\n`argparse` is part of the Python standard library and supports subcommands via subparsers.\n\n1. **Example Script**:\n\n   ```python\n   import argparse\n\n   def main():\n       parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='A simple CLI tool')\n       subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command', help='sub-command help')\n\n       # Create the parser for the \"start\" command\n       parser_start = subparsers.add_parser('start', help='Start the process')\n       parser_start.set_defaults(func=start)\n\n       # Create the parser for the \"stop\" command\n       parser_stop = subparsers.add_parser('stop', help='Stop the process')\n       parser_stop.set_defaults(func=stop)\n\n       args = parser.parse_args()\n\n       if args.command is None:\n           parser.print_help()\n       else:\n           args.func()\n\n   def start():\n       print('Starting the process...')\n\n   def stop():\n       print('Stopping the process...')\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       main()\n   ```\n\n   This script will also provide help messages and response based on the command provided.\n\nBoth Click and argparse are powerful and can be used to build complex command-line interfaces. If you prefer a more declarative and succinct style, Click might be the better choice, while argparse offers more control and is part of the standard library, so it doesn't require additional dependencies."
