I have a list such as:\n\n```python\nall_data = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10, 11, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 15]\n```\nFrom this list, I would like to randomly select a list of unique numbers like `[2, 11, 15]` but not a list like `[3, 8, 8]` which has repeating numbers."

        "content": "To select a specific number of unique, non-repeating numbers randomly from the list you have, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. First, convert the list to a set to remove duplicates.\n2. Then, use Python's `random.sample()` function to randomly select the desired number of unique elements from this set.\n\nHere's how you can do it in Python:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# Original list with potential duplicates\nall_data = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10, 11, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 15]\n\n# Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates\nunique_data = list(set(all_data))\n\n# Specify the number of unique elements you want to select\nx = 3\n\n# Randomly select 'x' unique elements from the set\nselected_numbers = random.sample(unique_data, x)\n\nprint(selected_numbers)\n```\n\nThis code will output a list of `x` unique numbers randomly selected from your original list, ensuring no duplicates are included in the selection. Note that `random.sample()` will raise an error if `x` is greater than the number of unique elements in the list, so ensure `x` is appropriate for the size of your unique data set."
