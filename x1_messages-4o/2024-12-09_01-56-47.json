        "content": "The error you are encountering, \"ImportError: cannot import name np_utils,\" suggests that there might be an issue with the Keras installation or the version of Keras you're using. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Keras Version**:\n   Ensure you're using a compatible version of Keras. Some versions of Keras have reorganized utilities, so `np_utils` might be located differently or renamed.\n\n2. **Reinstall Keras**:\n   Sometimes, a clean installation can resolve such issues. Uninstall and then reinstall Keras:\n   ```bash\n   sudo pip uninstall keras\n   sudo pip install keras\n   ```\n\n3. **Check TensorFlow Version**:\n   Since Keras is now integrated into TensorFlow, consider using `tensorflow.keras` instead. You may need to upgrade TensorFlow:\n   ```bash\n   sudo pip install --upgrade tensorflow\n   ```\n\n   Then, modify your import statements:\n   ```python\n   from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\n   from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, LSTM\n   ```\n\n4. **Install Specific Version of Keras**:\n   If the problem persists, you might want to install a specific version of Keras that is known to work. For example:\n   ```bash\n   sudo pip install keras==2.3.1\n   ```\n\n5. **Update Numpy**:\n   Ensure that your numpy package is up to date, as some compatibility issues might arise from outdated packages:\n   ```bash\n   sudo pip install --upgrade numpy\n   ```\n\n6. **Check Python Environment**:\n   If you're using virtual environments, ensure that Keras and all dependencies are installed within the same environment.\n\n7. **Use Alternative Imports**:\n   If the `np_utils` module is specifically needed, you can import it directly from Keras:\n   ```python\n   from keras.utils import np_utils\n   ```\n\n8. **Check for File Conflicts**:\n   Sometimes, local files with the same name as modules can cause conflicts. Ensure there's no file named `keras.py` in your working directory that might be interfering with the import process.\n\nTry these steps, and one of them should resolve the import error you're experiencing."
