I keep getting \"undefined reference to\" errors, even though the file libpython.a is available. This is the Cython code I'm trying to compile:\n\n```python\ncdef void say_hello(name):\n    print \"Hello %s\" % name\n```\n\nI'm running these commands:\n\n```bash\n$ cython ctest.pyx\n$ gcc ctest.c -I\"C:\\Python27\\include\"\n```\n\nAnd I get these errors:\n\n```bash\nC:\\Users\\niklas\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\cckThGrF.o:ctest.c:(.text+0x1038): undefined reference to `_imp__PyString_FromStringAndSize'\nC:\\Users\\niklas\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\cckThGrF.o:ctest.c:(.text+0x1075): undefined reference to `_imp___Py_TrueStruct'\nC:\\Users\\niklas\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\cckThGrF.o:ctest.c:(.text+0x1086): undefined reference to `_imp___Py_ZeroStruct'\nC:\\Users\\niklas\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\cckThGrF.o:ctest.c:(.text+0x1099): undefined reference to `_imp___Py_NoneStruct'\nC:\\Users\\niklas\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\cckThGrF.o:ctest.c:(.text+0x10b8): undefined reference to `_imp__PyObject_IsTrue'\nc:/program files/mingw/bin/../lib/gcc/mingw32/4.5.2/../../../libmingw32.a(main.o):main.c:(.text+0xd2): undefined reference to `WinMain@16'\ncollect2: ld returned 1 exit status\n```\n\nHowever, if I use pyximport or a setup-script it works fine, but these methods are not handy when still working on a module. How can I compile the .c files generated with Cython using gcc? \n\nAlso, when using pyximport, is it normal that only python-native functions and classes are contained in the imported module and not cdef-functions and classes? For example:\n\n```python\n# filename: cython_test.pyx\ncdef c_foo():\n    print \"c_foo !\"\ndef foo():\n    print \"foo !\"\n    c_foo()\n```\nWhen I run this:\n```python\nimport pyximport as p; p.install()\nimport cython_test\ncython_test.foo()\n# foo !\\nc_foo !\ncython_test.c_foo()\n# AttributeError, module object has no attribute c_foo\n```\nI get an AttributeError, as the module object has no attribute c_foo."

        "content": "To address the issues you're facing, let's break down the solutions for both the compilation errors and the behavior you're observing with `pyximport`.\n\n### Compilation Issues with GCC\n\nThe \"undefined reference\" errors typically occur when the linker cannot find the required symbols from the Python library. Here's what you can do:\n\n1. **Link Against the Python Library:**\n   You need to explicitly link against the Python library when compiling. Make sure you have the correct path to the Python library and include it in your command. Also, make sure to use the correct library for your Python version.\n\n   ```bash\n   gcc ctest.c -I\"C:\\Python27\\include\" -L\"C:\\Python27\\libs\" -lpython27\n   ```\n\n   - `-L\"C:\\Python27\\libs\"`: Specifies the directory where `libpython.a` or `python27.lib` is located.\n   - `-lpython27`: Links against the Python library.\n\n2. **Use the Correct Compiler Flags:**\n   Ensure you're using the appropriate flags for building a shared library or an executable. For a shared library, the `-shared` flag is usually required:\n\n   ```bash\n   gcc -shared -o ctest.pyd ctest.c -I\"C:\\Python27\\include\" -L\"C:\\Python27\\libs\" -lpython27\n   ```\n\n3. **MinGW and Python Compatibility:**\n   Sometimes, compatibility issues arise between MinGW and the Python version you're using. Ensure that your MinGW installation is compatible with the Python version or consider using another compiler, like MSVC, which is often easier to use with Python on Windows.\n\n### `pyximport` and Access to `cdef` Functions\n\nThe behavior you\u2019re observing is expected. In Cython, `cdef` functions are not exposed as part of the Python module's public API. They are intended to be used internally within the Cython code or from other Cython modules. If you want a function to be accessible from Python, you should define it using `def`.\n\nHere's how you can make `c_foo` accessible:\n\n```python\n# filename: cython_test.pyx\ncdef c_foo():\n    print \"c_foo !\"\n\ndef foo():\n    print \"foo !\"\n    c_foo()\n\ndef public_c_foo():\n    c_foo()\n```\n\nIn this setup, `public_c_foo` serves as a Python-accessible wrapper around `c_foo`. Now you can call `cython_test.public_c_foo()` from Python.\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- When developing Cython modules, using `pyximport` or setup scripts is typically more convenient. For development purposes, `setup.py` scripts can be configured to automatically compile Cython files whenever they change.\n  \n- Ensure that your environment variables (e.g., `PATH`, `PYTHONPATH`) are properly set up to include the paths to your compiler and Python installation.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to compile your Cython code successfully and understand the behavior of `cdef` functions within Python modules."
