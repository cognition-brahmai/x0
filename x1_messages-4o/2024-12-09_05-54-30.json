        "content": "I am having trouble understanding nested list comprehensions in Python. I understand how a simple list comprehension works, for example, `[x*2 for x in range(5)]` returns `[0,2,4,6,8]`. I also understand how a nested list comprehension works when manipulating strings, as shown in the example below:\n\n```python\nw_list = [\"i_have_a_doubt\", \"with_the\",\"nested_lists_comprehensions\"]\n\n# returns the list of strings without underscore and capitalized\nprint [replaced.title() for replaced in [el.replace(\"_\",\" \")for el in w_list]]\n```\n\nHowever, when I tried to use a nested list comprehension with two numerical lists like this:\n\n```python\nl1 = [100,200,300]\nl2 = [0,1,2]\n[x + y for x in l2 for y in l1 ]\n```\n\nI expected this output `[100,201,302]` but got this instead `[100,200,300,101,201,301,102,202,302]`. I found an alternative solution that gave me the result I wanted, which was `[x + y for x,y in zip(l1,l2)]`, but I don't understand why I got a return of 9 elements with the first piece of code. Could you please explain this?"

        "content": "Certainly! The confusion here arises from the way nested list comprehensions work in Python. Let's break down the nested list comprehension you used:\n\n```python\n[x + y for x in l2 for y in l1]\n```\n\nThis comprehension is equivalent to having two nested loops:\n\n```python\nresult = []\nfor x in l2:\n    for y in l1:\n        result.append(x + y)\n```\n\nHere's what happens step-by-step:\n\n1. For the first element of `l2` (which is `0`), the inner loop iterates over all elements of `l1`. This results in the calculations: `0 + 100`, `0 + 200`, and `0 + 300`. These values are added to the result list.\n2. For the second element of `l2` (which is `1`), the inner loop again iterates over all elements of `l1`. This results in: `1 + 100`, `1 + 200`, and `1 + 300`. These values are added to the result list.\n3. For the third element of `l2` (which is `2`), the inner loop does the same: `2 + 100`, `2 + 200`, and `2 + 300`. These values are added to the result list.\n\nThat\u2019s how you end up with the list `[100, 200, 300, 101, 201, 301, 102, 202, 302]`.\n\nThe comprehension `[x + y for x, y in zip(l1, l2)]` gives you the desired output `[100, 201, 302]` because it pairs elements from `l1` and `l2` one-by-one using `zip`:\n\n- Pairs `100` (from `l1`) with `0` (from `l2`) to get `100 + 0 = 100`\n- Pairs `200` (from `l1`) with `1` (from `l2`) to get `200 + 1 = 201`\n- Pairs `300` (from `l1`) with `2` (from `l2`) to get `300 + 2 = 302`\n\nThus, `zip` is effectively aligning elements from both lists in a one-to-one fashion, which matches your expected behavior."
