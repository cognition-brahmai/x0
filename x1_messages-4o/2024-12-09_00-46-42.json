I am developing an application where the number of figures is based on user input and changes throughout the application's life. Users can issue a \"plot\" command to generate a new figure window with the selected data series. I want to improve user experience by providing a command to programmatically arrange all open figure windows in a convenient arrangement (like tiling them across the available screen space). While I have found APIs to adjust the size of the figure window (in pixels), I have not found a way to set their absolute position on the screen. Is there a way to do this without delving into the details of the backend in use and in a backend-agnostic way to avoid relying on implementation details that might change in the future?"

        "content": "To set the absolute position of figure windows in a Python application using matplotlib, you typically need to interface with the GUI backend that matplotlib uses to render figures. While matplotlib itself doesn't provide a straightforward, backend-agnostic way to set the position of figure windows, you can leverage the capabilities of the specific GUI backend in use. Below, I'll outline a general approach you can use with some of the common backends.\n\n### Using TkAgg Backend\n\nIf you're using the TkAgg backend (which is quite common), you can access the underlying Tkinter window and set its position. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef set_window_position(fig, x, y):\n    # Draw the figure so that it's assigned a window manager\n    fig.canvas.manager.window.wm_geometry(f\"+{x}+{y}\")\n\n# Example usage\nfig1 = plt.figure()\nset_window_position(fig1, 100, 100)\nplt.show()\n\nfig2 = plt.figure()\nset_window_position(fig2, 400, 100)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Using Qt5Agg Backend\n\nFor the Qt5Agg backend, you can use PyQt5 to manipulate the window properties:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef set_window_position(fig, x, y):\n    # Get the underlying Qt widget and set its position\n    fig.canvas.manager.window.move(x, y)\n\n# Example usage\nfig1 = plt.figure()\nset_window_position(fig1, 100, 100)\nplt.show()\n\nfig2 = plt.figure()\nset_window_position(fig2, 400, 100)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Using WxAgg Backend\n\nIf you're using WxAgg, the approach is similar but uses wxPython:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef set_window_position(fig, x, y):\n    # Get the underlying wx window and set its position\n    fig.canvas.manager.window.SetPosition((x, y))\n\n# Example usage\nfig1 = plt.figure()\nset_window_position(fig1, 100, 100)\nplt.show()\n\nfig2 = plt.figure()\nset_window_position(fig2, 400, 100)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### General Approach for Tiling\n\nTo tile the figures across the screen, you could write a function that calculates positions based on the number of figures and the screen resolution. This might involve using a library like `screeninfo` to get the available screen size.\n\nHere's a simple example assuming a fixed screen size:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef tile_figures(figures, screen_width=1920, screen_height=1080, columns=2):\n    # Calculate window width and height based on the number of columns\n    window_width = screen_width // columns\n    window_height = screen_height // (len(figures) // columns + 1)\n\n    for i, fig in enumerate(figures):\n        x = (i % columns) * window_width\n        y = (i // columns) * window_height\n        set_window_position(fig, x, y)\n\n# Example usage\nfigures = [plt.figure() for _ in range(4)]\ntile_figures(figures)\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis approach needs to be adapted depending on your specific GUI backend. Additionally, remember to ensure that the backend is compatible with your intended deployment environment."
