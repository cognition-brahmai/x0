I am dealing with a text corpus to calculate its tfidf score and am using the module sklearn.feature_extraction.text for this. I have used CountVectorizer and TfidfTransformer to vectorise my corpus and calculate the tfidf for each vocabulary. However, I now have a sparse matrix, like:\n\n(0, 47) 0.104275891915\n(0, 383)    0.084129133023\n.\n.\n.\n.\n(4, 308)    0.0285015996586\n(4, 199)    0.0285015996586\n\nI want to convert this sparse.csr.csr_matrix into a list of lists so that I can get rid of the document id from the above csr_matrix and get the tfidf and vocabularyId pair like\n\n47:0.104275891915 383:0.084129133023\n.\n.\n.\n.\n308:0.0285015996586 \n199:0.0285015996586\n\nIs there any way to convert into a list of lists or any other way with which I can change the format to get tfidf-vocabularyId pair?"

        "content": "Yes, you can convert a sparse matrix to a list of lists and format it to your desired structure. You can achieve this by iterating through the non-zero elements of the sparse matrix. Below is a step-by-step approach to achieve this using Python and the `scipy` library:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer, TfidfTransformer\nfrom scipy.sparse import csr_matrix\n\n# Sample data\ndocuments = [\n    \"This is the first document.\",\n    \"This document is the second document.\",\n    \"And this is the third one.\",\n    \"Is this the first document?\"\n]\n\n# Initialize CountVectorizer\ncount_vectorizer = CountVectorizer()\ncount_matrix = count_vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)\n\n# Initialize TfidfTransformer\ntfidf_transformer = TfidfTransformer()\ntfidf_matrix = tfidf_transformer.fit_transform(count_matrix)\n\n# Convert sparse matrix to a list of lists with the desired format\ntfidf_list_of_lists = []\n\nfor doc_id in range(tfidf_matrix.shape[0]):\n    # Get non-zero indices and their corresponding tf-idf values\n    indices = tfidf_matrix[doc_id].indices\n    data = tfidf_matrix[doc_id].data\n    # Create a list of \"vocab_id:tfidf_value\" strings\n    doc_tfidf = [f\"{vocab_id}:{tfidf_value}\" for vocab_id, tfidf_value in zip(indices, data)]\n    tfidf_list_of_lists.append(doc_tfidf)\n\n# Print the result\nfor doc_tfidf in tfidf_list_of_lists:\n    print(\" \".join(doc_tfidf))\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. **CountVectorizer and TfidfTransformer**: These are used to convert your text documents into a matrix of token counts and then into a tf-idf representation.\n\n2. **Iterating through the Sparse Matrix**: The sparse matrix is iterated over by document (row). For each document, the non-zero indices (vocab ids) and their corresponding tf-idf scores are retrieved.\n\n3. **Formatting**: For each document, a list of strings is created in the format \"vocab_id:tfidf_value\".\n\nThis will give you a list of lists where each sublist corresponds to a document and contains strings representing the vocab id and the tf-idf value in your desired format."
