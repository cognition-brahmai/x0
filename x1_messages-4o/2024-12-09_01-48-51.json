        "content": "I am trying to set the text color in a Jinja2 template using CSS. I want the output string to print in a specific font color if the variable contains a certain string. However, every time the template is generated, it always prints in red due to the else statement. It never matches the first two conditions even though I expect them to. I have shared the code snippet below. My first suspicion was about enclosing the string I was checking for in quotes, but it didn't solve the situation. I also thought that Jinja wasn't expanding `RepoOutput[RepoName.index(repo)]` but I found that `RepoName` is being expanded properly in the for loop above. Can anyone help me fix this issue?\n\n```html\n{% for repo in RepoName %}\n   <tr>\n      <td> <a href=\"http://mongit201.be.monster.com/icinga/{{ repo }}\">{{ repo }}</a> </td>\n   {% if error in RepoOutput[RepoName.index(repo)] %}\n      <td id=error> {{ RepoOutput[RepoName.index(repo)] }} </td> <!-- I want this in green if it is up-to-date, otherwise I want it in red -->\n   {% elif Already in RepoOutput[RepoName.index(repo)] %}\n      <td id=good> {{ RepoOutput[RepoName.index(repo)] }} </td>   <!-- I want this in green if it is up-to-date, otherwise I want it in red -->\n   {% else %}\n        <td id=error> {{ RepoOutput[RepoName.index(repo)] }} </td> <!-- I want this in green if it is up-to-date, otherwise I want it in red -->\n   </tr>\n   {% endif %}\n{% endfor %}\n```"

        "content": "It seems like you are facing an issue with conditionally setting the text color in your Jinja2 template based on the content of a variable. Let's troubleshoot and resolve this issue step by step.\n\n### Possible Issues and Solutions:\n\n1. **Check for Correct String Matching:**\n   Ensure that the strings you are checking (`error` and `Already`) are correctly matched. Since Jinja2 is case-sensitive, ensure that the strings are exactly as they appear in `RepoOutput`.\n\n2. **Enclose Strings in Quotes:**\n   Make sure the string literals are enclosed in quotes. For example, `'error'` and `'Already'`.\n\n3. **Use Debugging:**\n   To debug, print the `RepoOutput[RepoName.index(repo)]` in the template to see what it actually contains. This can help verify if the content matches what you're checking against.\n\n4. **Avoid Using `index` Method:**\n   Using `RepoName.index(repo)` can be inefficient and error-prone. Instead, use the loop index provided by Jinja:\n\n   ```html\n   {% for repo_index, repo in enumerate(RepoName) %}\n      <tr>\n         <td> <a href=\"http://mongit201.be.monster.com/icinga/{{ repo }}\">{{ repo }}</a> </td>\n      {% if 'error' in RepoOutput[repo_index] %}\n         <td class=\"error\"> {{ RepoOutput[repo_index] }} </td>\n      {% elif 'Already' in RepoOutput[repo_index] %}\n         <td class=\"good\"> {{ RepoOutput[repo_index] }} </td>\n      {% else %}\n         <td class=\"error\"> {{ RepoOutput[repo_index] }} </td>\n      </tr>\n      {% endif %}\n   {% endfor %}\n   ```\n\n5. **CSS for Styling:**\n   Ensure that your CSS is correctly setting the colors for the classes `error` and `good`. For example:\n\n   ```css\n   .error {\n       color: red;\n   }\n   .good {\n       color: green;\n   }\n   ```\n\n6. **Check for Whitespace:**\n   Sometimes, unexpected whitespace can be part of the string. Use the `strip` method to remove any leading or trailing whitespace.\n\n### Summary:\n- Make sure string literals are correctly quoted.\n- Use the `enumerate` function for a cleaner and more robust approach.\n- Debug by printing out values to ensure they match expected conditions.\n- Ensure your CSS classes are correctly defined.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to correctly apply conditional styling to your HTML output. If the issue persists, consider further debugging by checking logs or using tools to inspect the rendered HTML."
