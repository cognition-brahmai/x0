        "content": "It looks like you're encountering issues because `pip3` isn't recognized as a package you can install directly using `easy_install`. Instead, you can install `pip` for Python 3 using the `get-pip.py` script or through Homebrew if you have it installed. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n### Method 1: Using `get-pip.py`\n\n1. **Download the `get-pip.py` script:**\n\n   Open your terminal and download the script using `curl`:\n\n   ```bash\n   curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Run the script with Python 3:**\n\n   Execute the script with Python 3 to install `pip` for Python 3:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 get-pip.py\n   ```\n\n   This will install `pip3` on your system.\n\n### Method 2: Using Homebrew\n\nIf you have Homebrew installed on your system, you can use it to install Python 3 and `pip3`:\n\n1. **Install Python 3 using Homebrew:**\n\n   ```bash\n   brew install python\n   ```\n\n   Homebrew will automatically install the latest version of Python 3, which includes `pip3`.\n\n### Verifying Installation\n\nAfter installation, you can verify that `pip3` has been installed by running:\n\n```bash\npip3 --version\n```\n\nThis command should display the version of `pip3` installed on your system.\n\nIf you face any issues or require further assistance, feel free to reach out!"
