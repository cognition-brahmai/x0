Identify the auxiliary verb: \"is\"\n2. Move \"is\" to the beginning of the sentence: \"Is\"\n3. Follow with the subject and the rest of the sentence: \"Is he going to the park\"\n4. Add a question mark: \"Is he going to the park?\"\n\nTherefore, the interrogative form of \"He is going to the park\" is \"Is he going to the park?\""
