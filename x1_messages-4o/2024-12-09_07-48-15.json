I know how to create a multi-line string with a few arguments like this:\n\n```python\ncmd = \"\"\"line %d\n  line %d\n  line %d\"\"\" % (1, 2, 3)\n```\nBut when I have a super long string with 30+ arguments, how can I pass those arguments in multiple lines? Passing them in a single line defeats the purpose of creating a multi-line string."

        "content": "When dealing with a multi-line string that requires a large number of arguments, you can split the arguments across multiple lines for better readability. Here's an example of how you can achieve this using Python's string formatting:\n\n```python\ncmd = \"\"\"line %d\nline %d\nline %d\nline %d\nline %d\nline %d\nline %d\nline %d\nline %d\nline %d\nline %d\nline %d\nline %d\nline %d\nline %d\nline %d\nline %d\nline %d\nline %d\nline %d\nline %d\nline %d\nline %d\nline %d\nline %d\nline %d\nline %d\nline %d\nline %d\nline %d\"\"\" % (\n    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,\n    11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,\n    21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30\n)\n```\n\nHere's what's happening in the code:\n- The multi-line string is defined using triple quotes `\"\"\"`, which allows it to span multiple lines.\n- The `%` operator is used for string formatting, where `%d` placeholders in the string are replaced by the corresponding values in the tuple.\n- The tuple containing 30+ arguments is split across multiple lines inside the parentheses for better readability.\n\nThis way, you maintain the readability of your code while effectively passing many arguments to a multi-line string. Additionally, consider using the newer `str.format()` method or f-strings (if you're using Python 3.6+) for more modern and flexible string formatting options."
