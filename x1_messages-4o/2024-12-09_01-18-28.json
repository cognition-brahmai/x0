        "content": "In Python 3, I have two classes, `Base` and `Child`, where the `Base` class has a factory method that calls another class method which may be overridden by `Base`'s child classes. Here is my code:\n\n```python\nclass Base(object):\n    @classmethod\n    def create(cls, *args: Tuple) -> 'Base':\n        value = cls._prepare(*args)\n        return cls(value)\n\n    @classmethod\n    def _prepare(cls, *args: Tuple) -> Any:\n        return args[0] if args else None\n\n    def __init__(self, value: Any) -> None:\n        self.value = value\n\n\nclass Child(Base):\n    @classmethod\n    def _prepare(cls, *args: Tuple) -> Any:\n        return args[1] if len(args) > 1 else None\n\n    def method_not_present_on_base(self) -> None:\n        pass\n```\n\nI want to use static type checking to infer that `Base.create()` returns an instance of `Base` and `Child.create()` returns an instance of `Child`. However, when I run the following code:\n\n```python\nbase = Base.create(1)\nchild = Child.create(2, 3)\nchild.method_not_present_on_base()\n```\n\nA static type checker complains that `method_not_present_on_base` is not present on the `Base` class. I thought about turning `Base` into a generic class and having the child classes specify themselves as type arguments, using the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP). But this feels rather unpythonic as CRTP is from C++. Is there a more Pythonic way to do this?"

        "content": "You can achieve the desired static type checking behavior in Python using generics and type variables from the `typing` module. This approach is indeed a bit inspired by the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP) from C++, but it is a common and Pythonic way to handle such cases where you want to maintain type safety and correct type inference across class hierarchies.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use generics for better type inference:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Type, TypeVar, Tuple, Any\n\nTBase = TypeVar('TBase', bound='Base')\n\nclass Base:\n    @classmethod\n    def create(cls: Type[TBase], *args: Tuple) -> TBase:\n        value = cls._prepare(*args)\n        return cls(value)\n\n    @classmethod\n    def _prepare(cls, *args: Tuple) -> Any:\n        return args[0] if args else None\n\n    def __init__(self, value: Any) -> None:\n        self.value = value\n\n\nclass Child(Base):\n    @classmethod\n    def _prepare(cls, *args: Tuple) -> Any:\n        return args[1] if len(args) > 1 else None\n\n    def method_not_present_on_base(self) -> None:\n        print(\"Method specific to Child class.\")\n\n# Usage\nbase = Base.create(1)\nchild = Child.create(2, 3)\nchild.method_not_present_on_base()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Type Variables**: \n   - `TBase` is a type variable that is bound to `Base`. This means `TBase` can be any type that is a subtype of `Base`.\n\n2. **Generic Method**:\n   - The `create` method is made generic by using `cls: Type[TBase]` as the type for `cls`. This ensures that whatever type is calling `create` (either `Base` or `Child`), the return type will be inferred to be of that type (`TBase`).\n\n3. **Static Type Checking**:\n   - When you call `Child.create()`, the static type checker understands that it should return an instance of `Child`, allowing you to call `method_not_present_on_base()` without any type errors.\n\nThis approach leverages Python's type hinting and type variable system to achieve the desired behavior in a clean and maintainable way."
