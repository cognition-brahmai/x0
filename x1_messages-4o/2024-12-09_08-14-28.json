        "content": "The `ImportError` you are encountering usually occurs when Python cannot find the specified module in your package structure. There are a few steps you can follow to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure `__init__.py` Files Are Present**:\n   - You've already added `__init__.py` files in the directories, which is good. This is necessary for Python to treat directories as packages.\n\n2. **Check Your Current Working Directory**:\n   - Ensure that your current working directory is set to the root of your project (`cts_sap_polaris`). When running the script, the path from which you execute it can affect module resolution.\n   - You can check your current working directory in your script by adding:\n     ```python\n     import os\n     print(os.getcwd())\n     ```\n\n3. **Use the Full Package Path**:\n   - Based on your directory structure, ensure that you are using the full path when importing. Since the `scripts` directory is at the same level as `lib`, try the import statement as follows:\n     ```python\n     from lib import cli_check\n     ```\n   - Or, if you are running from the root directory, use:\n     ```python\n     from cts_sap_polaris.lib import cli_check\n     ```\n\n4. **PYTHONPATH Environment Variable**:\n   - Make sure that your `PYTHONPATH` includes the root directory of your project (`cts_sap_polaris`). You can set it in your environment like so:\n     ```bash\n     export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/cts_sap_polaris:$PYTHONPATH\n     ```\n   - Alternatively, you can add it at runtime in your script:\n     ```python\n     import sys\n     sys.path.append('/path/to/cts_sap_polaris')\n     ```\n\n5. **Check for Name Conflicts**:\n   - Ensure there are no conflicting module or package names that could be causing issues.\n\n6. **Running as a Script**:\n   - If you are running the script directly, make sure to use the `-m` flag to run it as a module from the root directory:\n     ```bash\n     python -m scripts.cts_sap_polaris\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `ImportError` and successfully import the module. If the issue persists, double-check the path settings and ensure that there are no typos in your import statements."
