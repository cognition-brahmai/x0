Currently, I tried to implement a while loop to achieve this but I'm stuck in an infinite loop. Here is my current code:\n\n```python\nnStr = '000123000123'\npattern = '123'\ncount = a = 0\nwhile pattern in nStr[a:]:\n    a = nStr[a:].find(pattern)+1\n    count += 1\nreturn count\n```\n\nI was informed that count is a better way to do it, however, I am curious if there's a way to do it similar to what I have already done."

        "content": "Your current approach using a `while` loop can work, but you need to adjust your logic to avoid the infinite loop. The issue arises because you're not updating the starting index (`a`) correctly after finding a match. Here's a corrected version of your code using a `while` loop:\n\n```python\nnStr = '000123000123'\npattern = '123'\ncount = 0\na = 0\n\nwhile True:\n    # Find the index of the pattern in the substring starting from index a\n    index = nStr.find(pattern, a)\n    \n    # If the pattern is not found, break the loop\n    if index == -1:\n        break\n\n    # Increment the count\n    count += 1\n\n    # Update the starting index to the position after the current match\n    a = index + 1\n\n# Print the final count\nprint(count)\n```\n\nThis version uses `nStr.find(pattern, a)` to find the pattern starting from the current index `a`. Each time a match is found, the starting index `a` is updated to the position just after the current match, which prevents the loop from getting stuck at the same position.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `count` method, which is simpler and more efficient for this purpose:\n\n```python\nnStr = '000123000123'\npattern = '123'\ncount = nStr.count(pattern)\nprint(count)\n```\n\nThe `count` method is straightforward and should be used for counting non-overlapping occurrences of a substring. However, your `while` loop approach is useful if you need more control over the search process, such as finding overlapping occurrences or performing additional operations during each match."
