        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is related to the Xcode command-line tools on OS X Mavericks. It seems that the tools are either not properly installed or are not configured correctly. Here are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Update Xcode and Command Line Tools**:\n   - Make sure you have the latest version of Xcode installed from the App Store.\n   - Open Terminal and run the following command to ensure that the command-line tools are installed:\n     ```bash\n     xcode-select --install\n     ```\n\n2. **Set the Correct Path for Xcode**:\n   - Ensure that the correct path for Xcode's command line tools is set by running:\n     ```bash\n     sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\n     ```\n\n3. **Accept Xcode License**:\n   - You might need to accept the Xcode license agreement:\n     ```bash\n     sudo xcodebuild -license\n     ```\n\n4. **Install psycopg2 with pip**:\n   - It's generally recommended to use `pip` over `easy_install`. Try installing `psycopg2` using `pip`:\n     ```bash\n     pip install psycopg2\n     ```\n\n5. **Use psycopg2-binary**:\n   - If you're still facing issues, consider using the `psycopg2-binary` package, which is a standalone package that doesn't require compilation:\n     ```bash\n     pip install psycopg2-binary\n     ```\n\n6. **Check for Homebrew**:\n   - If you have Homebrew installed, ensure that your system libraries are up to date. You can update Homebrew and upgrade your packages with:\n     ```bash\n     brew update\n     brew upgrade\n     ```\n\n7. **Clean Build Artifacts**:\n   - Sometimes, cleaning up any existing build artifacts can help:\n     ```bash\n     rm -rf /tmp/easy_install-* /tmp/pip-* /tmp/build/*\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with installing `psycopg2` on OS X Mavericks. If you continue to experience problems, consider checking for any specific error messages output to the terminal, as they might offer further clues."
