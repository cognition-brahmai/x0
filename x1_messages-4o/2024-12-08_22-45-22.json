However, you can represent the sentence using a Java comment:\n\n```java\n// Original sentence in passive voice: The meeting was conducted by him.\n// Active voice sentence: He conducted the meeting.\n```\n\nIn Java, the focus is more on logic and functionality rather than linguistic voice. The transformation is more about understanding the subject (\"He\") performing the action (\"conducted\") on the object (\"the meeting\")."
