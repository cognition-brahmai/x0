        "content": "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled data, meaning that each training example is paired with an output label, allowing the model to learn the mapping from inputs to outputs. \n\nIn contrast, unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data and aims to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures within the input data, such as clustering, while reinforcement learning involves training an agent to make decisions by rewarding or punishing it based on the outcomes of its actions in a given environment.\n\nHyperparameters are crucial in the training process of supervised learning algorithms as they control the learning process and affect the model's ability to generalize from the training data; selecting the right hyperparameters can significantly impact the model's performance and efficiency.\n\nHere's a table showcasing the most commonly used hyperparameters for neural networks:\n\n| Hyperparameter        | Description                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Learning Rate         | Determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum.   |\n| Batch Size            | The number of training samples used in one forward/backward pass.           |\n| Number of Epochs      | The number of complete passes through the entire training dataset.          |\n| Optimizer             | Algorithm used to update the weights of the network, e.g., SGD, Adam.       |\n| Number of Layers      | The number of layers in the neural network architecture.                    |\n| Number of Neurons     | The number of neurons in each layer.                                        |\n| Activation Function   | The function used to introduce non-linearity, e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid.          |\n| Dropout Rate          | The fraction of neurons to drop during training to prevent overfitting.     |\n| Weight Initialization | Method used to set the initial weights of the network, e.g., Xavier, He.    |\n| Regularization        | Technique used to prevent overfitting, e.g., L1, L2 regularization.         |\n\nThese hyperparameters need to be carefully tuned to develop an effective neural network for a given problem."
