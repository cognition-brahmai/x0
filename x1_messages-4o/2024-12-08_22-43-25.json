It was launched by the Soviet Union on September 12, 1959, and impacted the Moon on September 14, 1959.\n\n### Detailed Information About the First Moon Landing Mission\n\n#### Agency:\n- **Soviet Union** (Luna 2)\n\n#### Launch Details:\n- **Date and Time**: September 12, 1959\n- **Duration of Mission**: Approximately 36 hours\n\n#### Propulsion System:\n- Luna 2 used chemical propulsion systems typical of the era, utilizing a combination of liquid fuels.\n\n#### Payload:\n- Scientific instruments designed to study cosmic rays, solar wind, and magnetic fields.\n\n#### Scientific Objectives:\n- To crash-land on the Moon and gather data on cosmic rays, solar wind, and the Moon's magnetic field.\n\n#### Data Collected:\n- Luna 2 confirmed that the Moon had no significant magnetic field and provided valuable data on cosmic rays and solar wind.\n\n#### Impact on Scientific Community and Public Perception:\n- The mission marked a significant achievement for the Soviet space program, boosting their prestige during the space race. It demonstrated the feasibility of reaching celestial bodies beyond Earth.\n\n#### Challenges:\n- Navigational challenges in reaching the Moon and ensuring accurate impact.\n\n### Comparison with Subsequent Lunar Missions\n\n#### Apollo 11 (First Manned Moon Landing):\n- **Agency**: NASA\n- **Mission Duration**: 8 days (July 16-24, 1969)\n- **Landing Site**: Sea of Tranquility\n- **Scientific Objectives**: Perform a manned lunar landing and return safely to Earth.\n- **Impact**: First human footprints on the Moon, massive impact on global public perception and scientific community.\n\n#### Advances in Subsequent Missions:\n- Improved landing precision and technology.\n- Collection of lunar rocks and soil for detailed analysis.\n- Experiments set up on the lunar surface (seismometers, retroreflectors).\n\n### Contribution to Understanding:\n- Subsequent missions expanded knowledge on lunar geology, the Moon's origin, and its impact history.\n- Provided a foundation for future space exploration missions and technologies.\n\n### Table of Moon Landing Missions\n\n| Mission Name   | Agency       | Launch Date | Landing Date | Mission Objectives                           | Notable Achievements                 |\n|----------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Luna 2         | Soviet Union | 12-Sep-1959 | 14-Sep-1959  | Impact the Moon and study cosmic phenomena   | First human-made object on the Moon  |\n| Luna 9         | Soviet Union | 31-Jan-1966 | 3-Feb-1966   | Soft landing and transmit photos             | First soft landing on the Moon       |\n| Apollo 11      | NASA         | 16-Jul-1969 | 20-Jul-1969  | First manned lunar landing                   | First humans on the Moon             |\n| Chang'e 4      | CNSA         | 7-Dec-2018  | 3-Jan-2019   | Study the far side of the Moon               | First landing on the Moon's far side |\n| Chandrayaan-3  | ISRO         | 14-Jul-2023 | 23-Aug-2023  | Soft landing and exploration of the Moon     | Demonstrated improved landing tech   |\n\nThis is a summary of some key missions; there are many more missions that contributed to our understanding of the Moon. Each mission, whether manned or unmanned, has added a layer of understanding to our knowledge of the Moon, helping shape the future of space exploration."
