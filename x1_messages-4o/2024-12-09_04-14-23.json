        "content": "The issue you're experiencing with the CSRF cookie not being set in your Django application could be due to several reasons. Let's go through some potential solutions and debugging steps you can try:\n\n1. **Ensure CSRF Middleware is Enabled:**\n   Make sure that `django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware` is included in your `MIDDLEWARE` settings in `settings.py`. This middleware is responsible for generating and checking the CSRF tokens.\n\n   ```python\n   MIDDLEWARE = [\n       ...\n       'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',\n       ...\n   ]\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Template Context:**\n   Ensure that you are using `RequestContext` or `render` function which automatically includes CSRF tokens in the context. In your code, you're using `render_to_response`, which is deprecated and doesn't automatically include context processors. Use `render` instead:\n\n   ```python\n   from django.shortcuts import render\n\n   def deposit(request, account_num):\n       if request.method == 'POST':\n           # Your existing logic\n           ...\n       else:\n           # Use render instead of render_to_response\n           return render(request, 'history.html', {'account_form': form})\n   ```\n\n3. **Ensure the Form is Valid:**\n   Double-check that the form is rendering correctly in the HTML. Sometimes, issues with rendering can cause CSRF tokens to be missing or not processed correctly.\n\n4. **Browser Debugging:**\n   Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the cookies and see if the CSRF token is being set properly. Look for any JavaScript errors that might be interfering with cookie processing.\n\n5. **Clear Browser Cache:**\n   Although you've mentioned trying different browsers, ensure that the cache and cookies are cleared, as stale cookies can sometimes cause issues.\n\n6. **Check for Subdomains or Cross-Domain Issues:**\n   If your Django application is served from a different subdomain or domain than the form is being submitted from, ensure that your `CSRF_COOKIE_DOMAIN` and `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` settings in `settings.py` are configured to allow the cookie to be set across these domains.\n\n   ```python\n   CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = ['https://yourdomain.com']\n   ```\n\n7. **Debug Output:**\n   Add some debug output to confirm the CSRF token is being generated:\n\n   ```python\n   from django.middleware.csrf import get_token\n\n   def deposit(request, account_num):\n       print(get_token(request))  # Print the CSRF token for debugging\n       ...\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue with the CSRF cookie not being set in your Django application. If the problem persists, it may be helpful to check the Django documentation for any updates or common issues related to CSRF handling."
