        "content": "To calculate the number of business days between a start and end date using pandas in Python, you can use the `pd.bdate_range` function, which generates a range of business days. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Define the start and end dates\nstart_date = '2023-10-01'\nend_date = '2023-10-15'\n\n# Generate a range of business days\nbusiness_days = pd.bdate_range(start=start_date, end=end_date)\n\n# Calculate the number of business days\nnum_business_days = len(business_days)\n\nprint(f\"The number of business days between {start_date} and {end_date} is {num_business_days}.\")\n```\n\nThis code will give you the number of business days, excluding weekends and any holidays you might want to specify. If you want to exclude holidays as well, you can pass a `CustomBusinessDay` object with holidays specified to the `freq` parameter of `bdate_range`. Here's how you can do that:\n\n```python\nfrom pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessDay\n\n# Define a list of holidays\nholidays = ['2023-10-02']\n\n# Create a custom business day object\ncustom_bday = CustomBusinessDay(holidays=holidays)\n\n# Generate a range of business days considering specified holidays\nbusiness_days_with_holidays = pd.bdate_range(start=start_date, end=end_date, freq=custom_bday)\n\n# Calculate the number of business days considering holidays\nnum_business_days_with_holidays = len(business_days_with_holidays)\n\nprint(f\"The number of business days between {start_date} and {end_date} excluding holidays is {num_business_days_with_holidays}.\")\n```\n\nThis approach allows you to easily calculate the number of business days between two dates, taking into account weekends and any specified holidays."
