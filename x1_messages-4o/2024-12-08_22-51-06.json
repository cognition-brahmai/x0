The first two numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers (e.g. 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...). Good luck!"

        "content": "Flowers of the Rosa genus, specifically roses, often exhibit a number of petals that corresponds to numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. While not all roses follow this rule strictly due to variations in species and cultivars, a common number of petals for many roses is 5, which is a Fibonacci number.\n\nLet's briefly look at the beginning of the Fibonacci sequence to confirm this:\n- 1, 1, 2, 3, **5**, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...\n\nSo, a typical Rosa flower with ovate-shaped petals arranged in a spiral formation would likely have 5 petals, adhering to the Fibonacci pattern observed in many natural phenomena."
