I want to include these as package data. The library structure is as follows:\n\n```python\n library\n    - foo.py\n    - bar.py\n data\n   subfolderA\n      subfolderA1\n      subfolderA2\n   subfolderB\n      subfolderB1 \n      ...\n```\n\nDo I need to manually add an `__init__.py` file in each subfolder? Can setup.py find these files recursively? Or do I need to manually add all of these in setup.py like:\n\n```python\npackage_data={\n  'mypackage.data.folderA': ['*'],\n  'mypackage.data.folderA.subfolderA1': ['*'],\n  'mypackage.data.folderA.subfolderA2': ['*']\n   },\n```\n\nThe hierarchy of these folders is important because this is a database of material files and we want the file tree to be preserved when we present them in a GUI to the user."

        "content": "To include package data recursively in Python's `setup.py`, you can utilize the `setuptools` package which provides the functionality to automatically include package data files. Here's how you can do it without manually specifying each subfolder and file:\n\n1. **No need for `__init__.py`**: Since these are data files and not Python packages, you don't need to add `__init__.py` files in each subfolder. However, if any of these subdirectories are meant to be Python packages, then you would need `__init__.py` files.\n\n2. **Using `setuptools`**: You can use the `setuptools.find_packages()` function along with the `include_package_data=True` and `package_data` options to automatically include package data.\n\n3. **Using `MANIFEST.in`**: You can define a `MANIFEST.in` file to specify which files should be included in the package distribution.\n\nHere's an example of how you can set up your `setup.py`:\n\n```python\nfrom setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\nsetup(\n    name='mypackage',\n    version='0.1',\n    packages=find_packages(),\n    include_package_data=True,  # This ensures package data is included\n    package_data={\n        # If you have specific patterns, you can specify them here\n        '': ['*.txt', '*.csv', '*.json'],  # Adjust patterns as needed\n    },\n    # Other arguments such as author, description, etc.\n)\n```\n\nAnd your `MANIFEST.in` might look like this:\n\n```\nrecursive-include data *\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`find_packages()`**: This function will find all your packages automatically. You don't need to manually specify each package.\n- **`include_package_data=True`**: This tells setuptools to include data files specified in your `MANIFEST.in`.\n- **`package_data`**: Here, the empty string `''` as the key means that patterns apply to all packages. You can adjust the patterns to match the file types you want to include.\n- **`MANIFEST.in`**: The `recursive-include data *` line tells setuptools to include all files in the `data` directory and its subdirectories.\n\nThis setup should preserve the folder hierarchy and include all the necessary data files when you package your library."
