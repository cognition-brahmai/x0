I have a loop for plotting multiple lines and markers with matplotlib, where the axes color cycle has been set in the matplolibrc param file. However, the marker and line colors are different as per the axes color cycle. I need the markers and lines plotted in their range to be of the same color. Here's my current code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport itertools\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nm = 5\nn = 5\nx = np.zeros(shape=(m, n))\nplt.figure(figsize=(5.15, 5.15))\nplt.clf()\nplt.subplot(111)\nmarker = itertools.cycle(('o', 'v', '^', '<', '>', 's', '8', 'p'))\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    x = np.dot(i, [1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3])\n    y = x ** 2\n    plt.plot(x, y, linestyle='', markeredgecolor='none', marker=marker.next())\n    plt.plot(x, y, linestyle='-')\nplt.ylabel(r'\\textit{y}', labelpad=6)\nplt.xlabel(r'\\textit{x}', labelpad=6)\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThe output I get is different colors for markers and lines. How can I have the same color for both?"

        "content": "To ensure that the markers and lines in your Matplotlib plot have the same color, you can explicitly set the color for both the markers and the lines within your loop. This can be done by retrieving the current color from the color cycle and applying it to both the `plot` calls. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport itertools\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nm = 5\nn = 5\nx = np.zeros(shape=(m, n))\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(5.15, 5.15))\nplt.clf()\nax = plt.subplot(111)\n\nmarker = itertools.cycle(('o', 'v', '^', '<', '>', 's', '8', 'p'))\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    x = np.dot(i, [1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3])\n    y = x ** 2\n    \n    # Get the next color from the color cycle\n    color = next(ax._get_lines.prop_cycler)['color']\n    \n    # Use the same color for both markers and lines\n    plt.plot(x, y, linestyle='', markeredgecolor='none', marker=next(marker), color=color)\n    plt.plot(x, y, linestyle='-', color=color)\n\nplt.ylabel(r'\\textit{y}', labelpad=6)\nplt.xlabel(r'\\textit{x}', labelpad=6)\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this modified code, `color = next(ax._get_lines.prop_cycler)['color']` retrieves the next color from the axes' color cycle, and this color is then applied to both the markers and lines using the `color` parameter. This ensures that both markers and lines have the same color for each iteration."
