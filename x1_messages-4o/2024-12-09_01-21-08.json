I have compressed my time series data by taking the mean of every 2 points as one, so I need to predict 90 steps ahead. I am having trouble implementing the neural network for this purpose. I've tried using an Elman recurrent neural network and `newff`. I have 100 input points and 90 output points. What could be the most efficient hidden node size? I am facing issues with training my complete data which is around 900,000. I tried iterative training but the accuracy decreases rapidly after 20,000 trained data. I also attempted iteratively training only 1000 portion of the data without merging with previous trained data but it overwrites the weight. How can I effectively predict 90 points ahead in time series and what is the best way for iterative training?"

        "content": "Predicting 90 steps ahead in a time series using neural networks can be challenging, especially with a large dataset like yours. Here are some suggestions that might help you improve your model and training process:\n\n1. **Model Architecture**:\n   - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Since you're working with time series data, RNNs or their variants like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks or Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) are more suitable than traditional feedforward networks. They are designed to handle sequences and can capture temporal dependencies better.\n   - **Hidden Node Size**: There's no one-size-fits-all answer for the number of hidden nodes. It depends on the complexity of your data. A good starting point is to have a hidden layer size similar to the input size, and then experiment by scaling it up or down. Grid search or random search can help in hyperparameter tuning.\n\n2. **Data Preprocessing**:\n   - **Normalization**: Ensure that your data is normalized, which helps in faster convergence and better performance.\n   - **Windowing**: Use a sliding window approach to create input-output pairs from your time series data. This could help in managing the large dataset by focusing on smaller windows of data.\n\n3. **Training Strategy**:\n   - **Batch Training**: Use mini-batch training instead of training the entire dataset at once. This helps in managing memory usage and can improve convergence.\n   - **Learning Rate**: Experiment with different learning rates. Sometimes a smaller learning rate can prevent the model from diverging when training on large datasets.\n   - **Callbacks**: Use callbacks like early stopping to prevent overfitting and save the best model during training.\n\n4. **Iterative Training**:\n   - **Checkpointing**: Save model checkpoints after training on each batch or epoch, so you can resume training later without starting from scratch.\n   - **Transfer Learning**: Train the model on a subset of data and use the learned weights to initialize the model before training on the next subset. This way, you retain knowledge from previous batches.\n\n5. **Model Evaluation**:\n   - **Validation Set**: Use a separate validation set to tune hyperparameters and evaluate model performance.\n   - **Metrics**: Choose appropriate metrics for evaluating your model, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), which are commonly used for regression tasks.\n\n6. **Advanced Techniques**:\n   - **Ensemble Methods**: Consider using ensemble techniques like combining predictions from multiple models to improve accuracy.\n   - **Attention Mechanisms**: If the sequence length is large, attention mechanisms can help the model learn which parts of the sequence are important for making predictions.\n\nBy experimenting with these strategies, you should be able to improve your model's performance and effectively predict 90 points ahead in your time series data."
