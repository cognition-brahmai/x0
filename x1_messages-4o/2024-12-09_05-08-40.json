Let's address each of these issues one by one.\n\n### SSL Certificate Issue\nThe SSL certificate error you're encountering is common when using Python's `urllib` library to scrape HTTPS websites. Here's how you can address it:\n\n1. **Install the Certificates**: On macOS, you might need to run the `Install Certificates.command` located in the Python directory to install the SSL certificates. You can find this in the `/Applications/Python 3.x/` directory.\n\n2. **Bypass SSL Verification**: While not recommended for production due to security concerns, you can bypass SSL verification for testing purposes:\n\n   ```python\n   import ssl\n   from urllib.request import urlopen\n   from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n   import re\n\n   ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context\n\n   pages = set()\n\n   def getLinks(pageUrl):\n       global pages\n       html = urlopen(\"https://en.wikipedia.org\" + pageUrl)  # Use HTTPS\n       bsObj = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')\n       for link in bsObj.findAll(\"a\", href=re.compile(\"^(/wiki/)\")):\n           if 'href' in link.attrs:\n               if link.attrs['href'] not in pages:\n                   newPage = link.attrs['href']\n                   print(newPage)\n                   pages.add(newPage)\n                   getLinks(newPage)\n\n   getLinks(\"\")\n   ```\n\n### Scrapy Command Not Found\nThe \"command not found: scrapy\" error typically indicates that Scrapy is not installed correctly or the PATH is not set up to include Scrapy's installation directory. Here's how you can fix it:\n\n1. **Ensure Scrapy is Installed**:\n   - Install Scrapy using pip:\n     ```bash\n     pip install scrapy\n     ```\n\n2. **Check PATH**:\n   - Ensure your environment's PATH includes the directory where Scrapy is installed. You can do this by adding the following line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file (depending on your shell):\n     ```bash\n     export PATH=\"$PATH:$(python -m site --user-base)/bin\"\n     ```\n   - After editing the file, run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc` to refresh the shell.\n\n3. **Virtual Environment**:\n   - If you are using a virtual environment, make sure it is activated when you're trying to run Scrapy. You can activate it using:\n     ```bash\n     source /path/to/your/venv/bin/activate\n     ```\n\n4. **Reinstall Scrapy**:\n   - If the above steps don't work, try reinstalling Scrapy:\n     ```bash\n     pip uninstall scrapy\n     pip install scrapy\n     ```\n\nAfter addressing these issues, you should be able to run your web scraping code and use Scrapy without encountering the mentioned errors.
