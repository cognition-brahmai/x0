        "content": "To find the cosine of the angle between the direction from her starting point A to her final point B, we need to determine the coordinates of point B relative to point A and then calculate the angle between the line connecting these two points and the horizontal axis.\n\nLet's first determine the coordinates of point B relative to point A:\n\n1. Mary starts at point A and walks 3 miles north. Her position is now (0, 3).\n2. She then walks 4 miles east. Her position is now (4, 3).\n3. Finally, she walks 5 miles south. Her position is now (4, -2).\n\nNow, we have the coordinates of point A as (0, 0) and point B as (4, -2).\n\nThe vector from A to B is:\n\\[ \\vec{AB} = (4 - 0, -2 - 0) = (4, -2) \\]\n\nWe need to find the cosine of the angle \u03b8 between the vector \\(\\vec{AB}\\) and the horizontal axis. The horizontal axis can be represented by the vector (1, 0).\n\nThe cosine of the angle \u03b8 between two vectors \\(\\vec{u} = (u_1, u_2)\\) and \\(\\vec{v} = (v_1, v_2)\\) is given by the dot product formula:\n\\[ \\cos(\u03b8) = \\frac{\\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{\\|\\vec{u}\\| \\|\\vec{v}\\|} \\]\n\nIn this case, \\(\\vec{u} = (4, -2)\\) and \\(\\vec{v} = (1, 0)\\).\n\nFirst, calculate the dot product:\n\\[ \\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{v} = (4)(1) + (-2)(0) = 4 \\]\n\nNext, calculate the magnitudes of \\(\\vec{u}\\) and \\(\\vec{v}\\):\n\\[ \\|\\vec{u}\\| = \\sqrt{4^2 + (-2)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 4} = \\sqrt{20} = 2\\sqrt{5} \\]\n\n\\[ \\|\\vec{v}\\| = \\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{1} = 1 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the cosine of the angle:\n\\[ \\cos(\u03b8) = \\frac{4}{2\\sqrt{5} \\cdot 1} = \\frac{4}{2\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}} \\]\n\nTo rationalize the denominator:\n\\[ \\cos(\u03b8) = \\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5} \\]\n\nFinally, calculate the value:\n\\[ \\cos(\u03b8) \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 2.236}{5} \\approx \\frac{4.472}{5} \\approx 0.89 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cosine of the angle between the direction of her starting point A and her final point B is approximately \\(0.89\\)."
