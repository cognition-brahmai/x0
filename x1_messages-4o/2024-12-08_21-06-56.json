Here are three possible consequences of eating unhealthy food:\n\n1. **Weight Gain**: Consuming foods high in calories, sugars, and unhealthy fats can lead to weight gain and obesity. This is because these foods often provide more energy than the body needs, leading to excess fat storage.\n\n2. **Health Issues**: A diet high in unhealthy foods can increase the risk of developing various health problems, such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. These conditions are often linked to poor dietary habits over time.\n\n3. **Reduced Energy Levels**: Unhealthy foods can lead to fluctuations in blood sugar levels, resulting in feelings of fatigue and low energy. This can affect daily activities, mental alertness, and overall productivity."
