I am currently working with the following piece of code and I would like to convert it into a list comprehension:\n\n```\ntable = ''\nfor index in xrange(256):\n    if index in ords_to_keep:\n        table += chr(index)\n    else:\n        table += replace_with\n```\n\nI attempted to convert it into a list comprehension, but I am not sure how to include the else statement:\n\n```\ntable = ''.join(chr(index) for index in xrange(15) if index in ords_to_keep)\n```"

        "content": "Yes, you can incorporate an `else` statement into a list comprehension by using a conditional expression (also known as a ternary operator). In Python, the syntax for a conditional expression is:\n\n```python\n<expression_if_true> if <condition> else <expression_if_false>\n```\n\nYou can use this within a list comprehension to handle both the `if` and `else` cases. Here is how you can convert your loop into a list comprehension:\n\n```python\ntable = ''.join(chr(index) if index in ords_to_keep else replace_with for index in xrange(256))\n```\n\nThis expression will go through each `index` in the range of 256 and check if it is in `ords_to_keep`. If it is, it will add `chr(index)` to `table`; otherwise, it will add `replace_with`. The `join` function then concatenates all the elements into a single string."
