I'm currently following the instructions on this page: https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/auth/web-app. According to step 2, I need the application's client ID and client secret. I can see the client ID in the 'Credentials' page for my app, however, I am unclear on what the client secret is or where to get it from. Can someone guide me on where to find the client secret and how to download it?"

        "content": "To use the Google API for Python, you need both the client ID and the client secret for OAuth 2.0 authentication. Here\u2019s how you can find and download them:\n\n1. **Go to the Google Cloud Console:**\n   - Navigate to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).\n\n2. **Select Your Project:**\n   - Make sure you have selected the correct project for which you want to use the Google Calendar API. You can select the project from the dropdown menu at the top of the page.\n\n3. **Enable the Google Calendar API:**\n   - If you haven\u2019t already, go to the \"APIs & Services\" section, then \"Library\", and enable the Google Calendar API for your project.\n\n4. **Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials:**\n   - Go to \"APIs & Services\" > \"Credentials\".\n   - Click on \"Create Credentials\", and select \"OAuth client ID\".\n   - If prompted, configure the consent screen by providing the necessary details.\n   - Select \"Web application\" as the application type.\n   - Enter a name for your credentials (e.g., \"iCal Integration\").\n   - In \"Authorized redirect URIs\", enter the URI where users will be redirected after they grant permission. This could be a local URL like `http://localhost:8000` if you are testing locally.\n   - Click \"Create\".\n\n5. **Download Your Credentials:**\n   - After creating the credentials, you will see a dialog box displaying the client ID and client secret.\n   - Click \"Download\" to download the credentials as a JSON file. This file contains both the client ID and client secret.\n\n6. **Store the Credentials Securely:**\n   - Store the downloaded JSON file securely, as it contains sensitive information.\n   - Use this file in your application to authenticate with Google\u2019s OAuth 2.0.\n\nOnce you have the JSON file, you can use it in your Python application to authenticate and make requests to the Google Calendar API. Make sure to install the necessary libraries, such as `google-auth` and `google-auth-oauthlib`, to handle the authentication process.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you might set up the authentication in your Python script:\n\n```python\nfrom google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials\nfrom google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow\nfrom googleapiclient.discovery import build\n\n# Define the scopes\nSCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar']\n\ndef main():\n    # Authenticate and build the service\n    flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file(\n        'path/to/your/credentials.json', SCOPES)\n    creds = flow.run_local_server(port=0)\n    \n    service = build('calendar', 'v3', credentials=creds)\n    \n    # Now you can use 'service' to interact with the Google Calendar API\n    # Example: list calendar events\n    events_result = service.events().list(calendarId='primary').execute()\n    events = events_result.get('items', [])\n\n    for event in events:\n        print(event['summary'])\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\nEnsure you replace `'path/to/your/credentials.json'` with the actual path to the JSON file you downloaded."
