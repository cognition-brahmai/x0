This operator unpacks the dictionary and passes its key-value pairs as keyword arguments to the function. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef func(**kargs):\n    # do something with kargs\n    print(kargs)\n\n# Define a dictionary\nmy_dict = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2', 'key3': 'value3'}\n\n# Call the function with the dictionary\nfunc(**my_dict)\n```\n\nWhen you use `**my_dict` in the function call, it unpacks the dictionary `my_dict` and passes its contents as keyword arguments to `func`. The function then receives these as the `kargs` dictionary inside the function, which you can use as needed."
