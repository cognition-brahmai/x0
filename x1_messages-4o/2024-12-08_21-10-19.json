Here's a brief breakdown of what the code does:\n\n1. `int num1 = 144;` initializes `num1` with the value 144.\n2. `int num2 = 3;` initializes `num2` with the value 3.\n3. `int num3 = 5;` initializes `num3` with the value 5.\n4. `double result = Math.Sqrt(num1) + (num2 * num3);` calculates the square root of 144, which is 12, and adds it to the product of 3 and 5, which is 15. The result is 27.\n5. `Console.WriteLine(\"The result is: \" + result);` outputs the result, which is 27.\n\nSo, when you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\nThe result is: 27\n```"
