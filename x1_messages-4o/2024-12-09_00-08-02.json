Here\u2019s a quick breakdown of the code:\n\n```php\n<?php\n$radius = 5; // Assign the radius of the circle\n$area = pi() * $radius * $radius; // Calculate the area using the formula \u03c0r^2\necho \"The area of the circle is \" . $area . \" square meters.\"; // Display the result\n?>\n```\n\nThis code calculates the area using the formula \\( \\pi \\times \\text{radius}^2 \\) and displays it on the webpage. The `pi()` function in PHP returns the value of \u03c0, which is approximately 3.14159. When executed on a server with PHP, it will output:\n\n```\nThe area of the circle is 78.539816339745 square meters.\n```\n\nMake sure you have a web server with PHP enabled to execute this code and see the result on a webpage."
