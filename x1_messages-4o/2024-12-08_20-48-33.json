        "content": "To visualize the top 10 tallest buildings including the Eiffel Tower using MATLAB, you'll need to first obtain the data from your SQL query, then import it into MATLAB, and finally create a bar graph. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n### Step 1: Execute the SQL Query and Export Data\n- Run the SQL query you provided on your database to get the data.\n- Export this data to a CSV file or directly import it into MATLAB using a database connection if applicable.\n\n### Step 2: Import Data into MATLAB\n- If you exported the data to a CSV file, use MATLAB's `readtable` function to import it.\n\n```matlab\ndata = readtable('buildings.csv'); % Replace with your file path\n```\n\n### Step 3: Prepare Data for Visualization\n- Extract the relevant columns from the table.\n\n```matlab\nnames = data.name;\nheights = data.height;\nconstruction_years = data.construction_year;\nlocations = data.location;\n```\n\n### Step 4: Create a Bar Graph\n- Use the `bar` function to create a bar graph of the building heights.\n\n```matlab\nfigure;\nbar(heights);\ntitle('Top 10 Tallest Buildings Including Eiffel Tower');\nxlabel('Buildings');\nylabel('Height (m)');\nset(gca, 'XTickLabel', names, 'XTick', 1:length(names));\nxtickangle(45); % Rotate x-axis labels for better visibility\n```\n\n### Step 5: Add Text Annotations for Construction Year and Location\n- Use the `text` function to add annotations for each bar.\n\n```matlab\nfor i = 1:length(names)\n    % Construct annotation text\n    annotationText = sprintf('%d\\n%s', construction_years(i), locations{i});\n    % Add text annotation\n    text(i, heights(i) + 10, annotationText, 'HorizontalAlignment', 'center', 'VerticalAlignment', 'bottom');\nend\n```\n\n### Step 6: Adjust the Visualization\n- Make sure the visualization is clear and labels are readable. Adjust the rotation of labels, font size, or figure size as needed.\n\n```matlab\nset(gca, 'FontSize', 10); % Adjust font size\nset(gcf, 'Position', [100, 100, 1200, 600]); % Adjust figure size\n```\n\n### Final Note\n- Ensure that the MATLAB path includes the CSV file if you are using `readtable`.\n- Adjust the annotations and graph properties to your liking for better presentation.\n\nThis script should help you visualize the top 10 tallest buildings alongside their construction year and location using MATLAB. Adjust any paths or file names as necessary to fit your specific setup."
