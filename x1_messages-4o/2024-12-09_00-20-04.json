The links to the API documentation are as follows: [ScheduledEmbeddingTrainingHelper](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/seq2seq/ScheduledEmbeddingTrainingHelper) and [ScheduledOutputTrainingHelper](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/seq2seq/ScheduledOutputTrainingHelper). I have also read the original paper on scheduled sampling which can be found here: [Scheduled Sampling Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03099). I am having trouble understanding the difference between `ScheduledEmbeddingTrainingHelper` and `ScheduledOutputTrainingHelper`. The documentation only mentions that `ScheduledEmbeddingTrainingHelper` is a training helper that adds scheduled sampling, while `ScheduledOutputTrainingHelper` is a training helper that adds scheduled sampling directly to outputs. Could someone explain the difference between these two helpers?"

        "content": "Sure, let's break down the differences between `ScheduledEmbeddingTrainingHelper` and `ScheduledOutputTrainingHelper` in the context of TensorFlow's seq2seq models with scheduled sampling.\n\n### Scheduled Sampling Overview\nScheduled sampling is a technique introduced to bridge the gap between training and inference phases in sequence-to-sequence models. During training, models are typically fed the ground-truth data as input at each step. However, during inference, the model only has access to its previous predictions. Scheduled sampling introduces randomness in training by sometimes using the model's predictions instead of the ground-truth data as input for the next step.\n\n### ScheduledEmbeddingTrainingHelper\nThis helper is designed to work with models that use embeddings. It does the following:\n\n- **Ground Truth vs. Predicted Inputs**: It probabilistically decides whether to use the ground-truth token or the model's predicted token for the next input to the decoder.\n- **Embedding Lookup**: When the model's prediction is used, it performs an embedding lookup to convert the predicted token into the corresponding embedding vector. This is crucial for models that rely on embeddings for input representation.\n- **Use Case**: It is particularly useful when you have an embedding layer and want the model to learn transitions in the embedding space, which is common in NLP tasks where words are represented as vectors.\n\n### ScheduledOutputTrainingHelper\nThis helper works at a more general level and is designed for models where scheduled sampling is applied directly to the outputs, regardless of whether embeddings are used.\n\n- **Ground Truth vs. Predicted Outputs**: Similar to `ScheduledEmbeddingTrainingHelper`, it randomly chooses between the ground-truth output and the model's predicted output at each step.\n- **Direct Output Handling**: This helper doesn't assume any embedding lookup. It directly deals with the raw outputs, which can be useful for models where outputs aren't necessarily mapped back to an embedding space.\n- **Use Case**: Ideal for scenarios where the output manipulation doesn't involve an embedding layer or when dealing with raw outputs, perhaps in tasks involving continuous values or non-embedded discrete values.\n\n### Key Differences\n- **Embedding Integration**: `ScheduledEmbeddingTrainingHelper` integrates with embedding layers by performing embedding lookups for predicted tokens, whereas `ScheduledOutputTrainingHelper` deals with the outputs directly without embedding considerations.\n- **Application Context**: Use `ScheduledEmbeddingTrainingHelper` when your model architecture involves embedding layers and you want scheduled sampling to interact with the embedding layer. Use `ScheduledOutputTrainingHelper` for more general cases where embedding transformation is not a concern.\n\nIn summary, the choice between the two helpers depends on whether your model architecture involves embeddings and how you want scheduled sampling to interact with these embeddings or directly with the outputs."
