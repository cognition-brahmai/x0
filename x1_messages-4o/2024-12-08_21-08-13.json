Specifically, assign 'A+' to those with a score greater than or equal to 95 and who took the exam in the morning, 'A' to those with a score greater than or equal to 90 but less than 95 and who took the exam in the afternoon, 'B+' to those with a score greater than or equal to 85 but less than 90 and who took the exam in the morning, 'B' to those with a score greater than or equal to 80 but less than 85 and who took the exam in the afternoon, 'C+' to those with a score greater than or equal to 75 but less than 80 and who took the exam in the morning, 'C' to those with a score greater than or equal to 70 but less than 75 and who took the exam in the afternoon, 'D+' to those with a score greater than or equal to 65 but less than 70 and who took the exam in the morning, 'D' to those with a score greater than or equal to 60 but less than 65 and who took the exam in the afternoon, and 'F' to those with a score less than 60. Here is an example list of student scores and exam times: \n[[55, 'morning'], [75, 'afternoon'], [80, 'morning'], [90, 'morning'], [95, 'afternoon'], [99, 'morning'], [100, 'afternoon']]. What is the most efficient way to assign grades to each student in the list considering both their scores and the time of their exams?"

        "content": "To achieve the task of assigning grades based on both scores and the time of day the exam was taken, we can create a Python function that iterates through the list of student scores and applies the grading logic accordingly. Here is a sample implementation:\n\n```python\ndef assign_grades(students):\n    grades = []\n    \n    for score, time_of_day in students:\n        if score >= 95 and time_of_day == 'morning':\n            grades.append('A+')\n        elif score >= 90 and score < 95 and time_of_day == 'afternoon':\n            grades.append('A')\n        elif score >= 85 and score < 90 and time_of_day == 'morning':\n            grades.append('B+')\n        elif score >= 80 and score < 85 and time_of_day == 'afternoon':\n            grades.append('B')\n        elif score >= 75 and score < 80 and time_of_day == 'morning':\n            grades.append('C+')\n        elif score >= 70 and score < 75 and time_of_day == 'afternoon':\n            grades.append('C')\n        elif score >= 65 and score < 70 and time_of_day == 'morning':\n            grades.append('D+')\n        elif score >= 60 and score < 65 and time_of_day == 'afternoon':\n            grades.append('D')\n        else:\n            grades.append('F')\n    \n    return grades\n\n# Example usage:\nstudents_scores_times = [\n    [55, 'morning'], \n    [75, 'afternoon'], \n    [80, 'morning'], \n    [90, 'morning'], \n    [95, 'afternoon'], \n    [99, 'morning'], \n    [100, 'afternoon']\n]\n\ngrades = assign_grades(students_scores_times)\nprint(grades)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We define a function `assign_grades` that takes a list of students with their scores and exam times.\n- We iterate over each student's data, unpacking the `score` and `time_of_day`.\n- Based on the conditions provided, we append the appropriate grade to the `grades` list.\n- The function returns the list of grades corresponding to each student in the input list.\n\nWhen you run the code, it will output the grades for each student based on the given conditions. This approach ensures that both the score and time of day are considered efficiently."
