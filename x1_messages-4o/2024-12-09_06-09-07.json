        "content": "The issue you are facing is likely due to the way Python handles module imports. Here are a few things you can check and try to resolve the ImportError:\n\n1. **Directory as a Package**: Ensure that your directory `2014_07_13_test` is recognized as a package by Python. To do this, add an `__init__.py` file to the directory. It can be an empty file. This informs Python that the directory should be treated as a package.\n\n2. **Current Working Directory**: Make sure your current working directory is set to `2014_07_13_test` when you execute `test.py`. You can do this by navigating to the directory in your terminal or command prompt and then running the script.\n\n3. **Python Path**: Ensure that the directory containing `test.py` and `hello.py` is in your Python path. Python needs to know where to look for the module you are trying to import. You can append the directory to your `sys.path` at the beginning of your `test.py`:\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   import os\n   sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)))\n   ```\n\n4. **Execution Method**: If you are running the script using an IDE like PyCharm or a text editor with a built-in terminal, make sure the IDE is correctly set up to use the directory `2014_07_13_test` as the working directory.\n\n5. **Python Version and Syntax**: The print statement in `hello.py` uses Python 2 syntax. If you are using Python 3, you need to change the print statement to:\n\n   ```python\n   print('HelloWorld!')\n   ```\n\n   Also, ensure that you are using the correct Python version compatible with your scripts.\n\n6. **Check for Typos**: Double-check the filenames and their extensions to ensure there are no typos. The files should be named exactly `hello.py` and `test.py`.\n\nAfter checking these points, try running your `test.py` script again. If you continue to experience issues, please provide more details about your environment and how you are executing the script."
