While the PDF is technically fine, the TOC is not visually appealing. As the TOC grows, it continues to increase in height. Even though I have adjusted the XSL to match the client's branding and design, I am unable to apply a top margin to the new page when the TOC breaks onto a new page. Is there a way, within wkhtmltopdf or python pdf-kit, to deal with page breaks in the TOC specifically, and place a better margin top on the new page? Can I supply a TOC as a traditional HTML page, so that I can manage this using JavaScript instead? I tried doing this with nth-child css, but it was ignored."

        "content": "When dealing with the generation of PDFs using `wkhtmltopdf` and `python-pdfkit`, customizing the Table of Contents (TOC) can be quite challenging, especially when it comes to visual layouts like handling page breaks and margins. Here are a few strategies you might consider:\n\n1. **Adjusting Page Breaks and Margins in XSLT**:\n   - You can try adding styles directly in your XSLT for the TOC. However, `wkhtmltopdf` may not fully respect all CSS properties, particularly for page breaks.\n   - Use CSS properties like `page-break-before`, `page-break-after`, and `page-break-inside` to manage how breaks occur. For margins, ensure your CSS targets the correct elements.\n\n2. **Using PDFkit Options**:\n   - `wkhtmltopdf` (and thus `python-pdfkit`) allows you to pass several options. You can try using the `--margin-top` option to set a margin, although this applies to the entire document, not just the TOC.\n   - Consider using the `--header-spacing` option to add space before headers, which might help with TOC readability.\n\n3. **Customizing TOC with JavaScript**:\n   - Unfortunately, `wkhtmltopdf` has limited JavaScript support, particularly for dynamic layout adjustments like modifying margins based on page content.\n   - While you can supply a TOC as an HTML page, remember that any JavaScript executed must complete before `wkhtmltopdf` starts rendering. This means you can't make adjustments based on rendered content.\n\n4. **Advanced Customization with HTML/CSS**:\n   - Consider generating the TOC as a separate HTML document and styling it independently. You can use CSS flexbox or grid to manage layouts better.\n   - The `nth-child` selector should work for styling specific elements, but ensure your selectors are precise and that `wkhtmltopdf` supports those styles.\n\n5. **Alternative Libraries**:\n   - If `wkhtmltopdf` limitations persist, you might explore other libraries like `WeasyPrint` or `Puppeteer` (via Node.js), which might offer more flexibility with modern CSS and JavaScript for generating PDFs.\n\n6. **Post-Processing**:\n   - After generating the PDF, use a tool like `PyPDF2` to adjust pages post-generation, although this requires a more complex setup.\n\nUltimately, the solution might involve a combination of CSS adjustments, PDFkit options, and potentially restructuring how the TOC is generated and styled. It can be a process of trial and error to find the right balance that meets your design requirements."
