I have a PostAdmin in the Django admin interface where I am able to select multiple tags for a post. I am trying to replicate this feature in the TagAdmin, where I want to include a list of posts associated with a tag. I attempted this by including 'posts' in the fields for TagAdmin but I received an 'ImproperlyConfigured' error. I got the same error when I used 'post_set'. Is there a recommended approach to implement this feature?\n\n<pre><code>\nclass Post(models.Model):\n    title = \u2026\n    published_on = \u2026\n    tags = models.ManyToManyField('Tag')\n\nclass Tag(models.Model):\n    name = \u2026\n</code></pre>"

        "content": "To achieve the functionality you want in Django's admin interface, where you can view and manage posts associated with a tag from the `TagAdmin`, you need to use a different approach since the `ManyToManyField` is defined on the `Post` model, not the `Tag` model. Therefore, you can't directly include a list of posts in the `fields` of `TagAdmin`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n1. **Use an Inline Model Admin**: You can use the `TabularInline` or `StackedInline` class to display related models in a Django admin. In this case, you can create an inline for `Post` in the `TagAdmin`.\n\n2. **Define an Inline for Post**: You need to define an inline admin class for the `Post` model within the `TagAdmin`.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom .models import Post, Tag\n\nclass PostInline(admin.TabularInline):\n    model = Post.tags.through\n    extra = 1\n    verbose_name = \"Associated Post\"\n    verbose_name_plural = \"Associated Posts\"\n\nclass TagAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    inlines = [PostInline]\n    list_display = ('name',)\n\nadmin.site.register(Tag, TagAdmin)\nadmin.site.register(Post)\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- **PostInline**: This inline represents the `Post` model. It uses `Post.tags.through` to access the intermediary model that Django automatically creates for the ManyToMany relationship. This allows you to edit the relationship from the `Tag` side.\n- **TagAdmin**: By adding the `PostInline` to `inlines`, you enable the admin interface to show a list of posts associated with each tag. You can add, edit, or remove associations here.\n- **Register Models**: Ensure both `Tag` and `Post` are registered with the admin site.\n\nThis setup will allow you to see and manage the posts associated with each tag directly from the `TagAdmin` interface, providing the functionality you were looking for."
