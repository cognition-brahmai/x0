However, while both modules work fine independently, I'm encountering issues when trying to use them together. I'm getting an error message: 'AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'graphviz_layout'. The error is reproduced with the following code:\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nG=nx.complete_graph(5)\nnx.draw_graphviz(G)\n```\n\nI've checked and verified that all the required packages for NetworkX and PyGraphViz are installed. When testing the installation of these modules in Python, MatPlotLib code examples work fine but GraphViz examples produce similar errors. PyGraphViz's tutorial page examples pass with Neato, PyDot, and Circo Post Script output. I've also installed GraphViz package binaries as required by PyGraphViz. What could be causing this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the `draw_graphviz` function has been removed in recent versions of NetworkX. Instead, you should use the `graphviz_layout` function from NetworkX in combination with Matplotlib to achieve similar functionality.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can modify your code to use `graphviz_layout`:\n\n1. Ensure that you have PyGraphviz installed correctly, as it is required for the `graphviz_layout` function to work.\n\n2. Use the following code to visualize the graph using NetworkX and PyGraphviz:\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Create a complete graph with 5 nodes\nG = nx.complete_graph(5)\n\n# Use graphviz_layout to get the positions of nodes\npos = nx.nx_agraph.graphviz_layout(G, prog='dot')\n\n# Draw the graph using Matplotlib\nnx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_size=700, node_color='lightblue', font_size=10, font_color='black', font_weight='bold')\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nMake sure you have Matplotlib installed to visualize the graph. If you encounter any issues with PyGraphviz, ensure that Graphviz binaries are correctly installed and available in your system's PATH. You can check the installation with:\n\n```bash\ndot -V\n```\n\nThis command should return the version of Graphviz if installed correctly. If not, you may need to reinstall or configure the PATH to include the Graphviz binaries."
