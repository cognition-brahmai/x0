To do this, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Open Settings/Preferences:**\n   - On Windows and Linux, go to `File` > `Settings`.\n   - On macOS, go to `PyCharm` > `Preferences`.\n\n2. **Navigate to Editor Settings:**\n   - In the Settings/Preferences window, expand the `Editor` section in the left-hand panel.\n\n3. **General Code Style:**\n   - Click on `General` under `Code Style`.\n\n4. **Ensure Line Feed at EOF:**\n   - Look for an option or checkbox labeled something like `Ensure line feed at file end on Save` and enable it.\n\n5. **Apply and Save:**\n   - Click `Apply` and then `OK` to save your changes.\n\nThis setting should ensure that a newline is automatically added to the end of your files when you save them, resolving the PEP 8 warning about missing newlines. If you don't see the exact option, make sure you are in the correct section and look for similar settings related to end-of-file newline handling."
