Currently, my code is saving the file in the same folder that the script is being run from. Here is my current code:\n```python\nr = requests.get(url)  \nwith open('file_name.pdf', 'wb') as f:\n    f.write(r.content)\n```"

        "content": "To modify your Python script to save a downloaded file to a specific directory, you need to specify the full path to the directory where you want the file to be saved. You can achieve this by concatenating the directory path with the file name when you open the file. Here's how you can adjust your code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\n\n# Specify the URL of the file you want to download\nurl = 'http://example.com/file_name.pdf'\n\n# Specify the directory where you want to save the file\ndirectory = '/path/to/your/directory'\n\n# Ensure the directory exists\nos.makedirs(directory, exist_ok=True)\n\n# Create the full file path\nfile_path = os.path.join(directory, 'file_name.pdf')\n\n# Perform the download and save the file\nr = requests.get(url)\nwith open(file_path, 'wb') as f:\n    f.write(r.content)\n\nprint(f\"File saved to {file_path}\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **`os.makedirs(directory, exist_ok=True)`**: This ensures that the specified directory exists. If it doesn't, it will be created.\n- **`os.path.join(directory, 'file_name.pdf')`**: This creates the full file path by joining the directory path with the file name.\n- Make sure to replace `'/path/to/your/directory'` with the actual path where you want to save the file. Also, ensure that you have write permissions for that directory."
