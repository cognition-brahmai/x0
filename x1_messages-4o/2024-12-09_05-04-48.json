I would prefer for each merge to have a suffix as it gets confusing if I do different combinations."

        "content": "When you're merging or joining DataFrames in pandas and want to ensure that a suffix is applied to columns from the right DataFrame, even if there are no collisions, you can specify the `suffixes` parameter in the `merge` or `join` method to enforce consistent suffixes. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Using `merge`\n\nIf you want to merge `df1` with `df2` and force a suffix even if there are no column name collisions, you can explicitly set the `suffixes` parameter:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrames\ndf1 = pd.DataFrame({\n    'key': ['A', 'B', 'C'],\n    'value_df1': [1, 2, 3]\n})\n\ndf2 = pd.DataFrame({\n    'key': ['A', 'B', 'C'],\n    'value_df2': [4, 5, 6]\n})\n\n# First merge with a suffix\nmerged_df = df1.merge(df2, on='key', suffixes=('', '_df2_1'))\nprint(merged_df)\n\n# Assume df3 is another DataFrame similar to df2\ndf3 = pd.DataFrame({\n    'key': ['A', 'B', 'C'],\n    'value_df2': [7, 8, 9]\n})\n\n# Second merge with a different suffix\nmerged_df2 = merged_df.merge(df3, on='key', suffixes=('', '_df2_2'))\nprint(merged_df2)\n```\n\n### Using `join`\n\nIf you're using `join`, you can also specify the `suffixes` parameter in a similar way:\n\n```python\n# Using join method\nmerged_df = df1.set_index('key').join(df2.set_index('key'), lsuffix='_df1', rsuffix='_df2_1')\nprint(merged_df)\n\n# Joining again with a different suffix\nmerged_df2 = merged_df.join(df3.set_index('key'), lsuffix='', rsuffix='_df2_2')\nprint(merged_df2)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **`suffixes=('', '_df2_1')`:** This parameter is used to specify what suffixes to append to overlapping column names from the left and right DataFrames, respectively. By providing a non-empty string, you ensure that even if there are no collisions, the specified suffix is applied.\n  \n- **`lsuffix` and `rsuffix`:** In the `join` method, `lsuffix` is added to columns with overlapping names in the left DataFrame, and `rsuffix` is added to columns with overlapping names in the right DataFrame.\n\nBy using these approaches, you can maintain consistent and clear column names across multiple merges or joins."
