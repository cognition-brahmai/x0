The first list should contain the first item from each tuple, and the second list should contain the second item from each tuple. For instance, given the original list [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3), ('d', 4)], I would like to transform it into (['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], [1, 2, 3, 4]). Is there a builtin function in Python that can do this?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this in Python using the built-in function `zip` along with unpacking. The `zip` function can be used to transpose the list of tuples, effectively separating the elements into two lists. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Original list of tuples\ntuples_list = [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3), ('d', 4)]\n\n# Using zip with unpacking to separate the tuples into two lists\nfirst_list, second_list = zip(*tuples_list)\n\n# Convert the results into lists\nfirst_list = list(first_list)\nsecond_list = list(second_list)\n\n# Print the results\nprint(first_list)  # Output: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']\nprint(second_list) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n```\n\nHere's what happens in the code:\n\n1. `*tuples_list` unpacks the original list of tuples, effectively passing each tuple as separate arguments to `zip`.\n2. `zip` then pairs the first elements of each tuple together and the second elements together.\n3. The result from `zip` is a zip object, which is then converted into two lists using `list()`.\n\nThis results in the two desired separate lists."
