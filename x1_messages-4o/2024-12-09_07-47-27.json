After successfully installing MariaDB 10, I made sure that both MySQL workbench and JPDB client work fine. The next step was to start programming with Python (specifically SQLAlchemy), which needs MySQL-python. So, I tried to update MySQL-python but encountered an error message: \"mysql_config not found\". I looked for the file in the standard locations but could not find it. Following suggestions from an earlier stack overflow question, I tried installing libmysqlclient-dev using \"apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev\". However, this resulted in a new issue: \"The following packages have unmet dependencies: libmysqlclient-dev : Depends: libmysqlclient18 (= 5.5.35-0ubuntu0.13.10.2) but 10.0.10+maria-1~saucy is to be installed\". I am unsure how to proceed from here. Could you provide a solution for this issue?"

        "content": "It sounds like you're experiencing a dependency conflict between MariaDB and the MySQL development libraries on Ubuntu 13.10. This is a common issue when trying to use MySQL-python with MariaDB, as the package dependencies can clash. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Remove Conflicting Packages:**\n   First, ensure that any conflicting MySQL packages are removed. You can do this with the following commands:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get remove --purge mysql-common mysql-client mysql-server mysql-client-core-* mysql-server-core-* mysql-client-5.5 mysql-server-5.5\n   ```\n\n2. **Install MariaDB Development Files:**\n   Instead of using `libmysqlclient-dev`, you should install the equivalent MariaDB development package. This package should provide the necessary `mysql_config` file.\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install libmariadbclient-dev\n   ```\n\n   If the package is not found, you might need to add the MariaDB repository to your system and update the package list:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install software-properties-common\n   sudo add-apt-repository 'deb [arch=amd64,arm64,ppc64el] http://mirror.mariadb.org/repo/10.0/ubuntu saucy main'\n   sudo apt-get update\n   ```\n\n   Then, try installing `libmariadbclient-dev` again.\n\n3. **Install MySQL-python:**\n   With the MariaDB client libraries installed, you should now be able to install MySQL-python without dependency issues. You can do this using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install python-pip\n   pip install MySQL-python\n   ```\n\n4. **Alternative: Use `mysqlclient`:**\n   If you're still experiencing issues, consider using the `mysqlclient` package, which is a fork of `MySQL-python` and is actively maintained. It works with both MySQL and MariaDB.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install mysqlclient\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify Installation:**\n   After installation, verify that your Python environment can import the MySQLdb module without issues:\n\n   ```python\n   import MySQLdb\n   ```\n\n   If there's no error, your installation is successful.\n\nIf you encounter further issues, you may need to check for any remaining conflicting packages or reconfigure your package sources. Additionally, consider upgrading to a more recent version of Ubuntu for better package support, as 13.10 is an older release."
