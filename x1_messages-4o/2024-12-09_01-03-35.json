For instance, I have two lists:\n\n<pre><code> A           = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]\nsubset_of_A  = [6, 9, 12]; # the subset of A\n</code></pre>\n\nI want the result to be [7, 8, 10, 11], which are the remaining elements after removing the elements of subset_of_A from A. Is there a built-in function in python that is capable of doing this?"

        "content": "Yes, in Python, you can use the built-in `filter()` function in combination with a lambda function to achieve this. However, a more straightforward approach would be to use a list comprehension to filter out elements from `A` that are present in `subset_of_A`.\n\nHere's how you can do it using list comprehension:\n\n```python\nA = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]\nsubset_of_A = [6, 9, 12]\n\nresult = [item for item in A if item not in subset_of_A]\n\nprint(result)  # Output: [7, 8, 10, 11]\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over each element in `A` and include it in the `result` list only if it is not present in `subset_of_A`. This provides you with the desired list of elements that are in `A` but not in `subset_of_A`."
