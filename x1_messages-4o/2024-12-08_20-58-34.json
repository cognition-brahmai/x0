Bananas develop from the ovary of the flower and contain seeds, thus classifying them as fruits.\n\n2. **Potato**: \n   - **Category**: Vegetable\n   - **Criteria**: Vegetables are typically classified as the edible parts of plants such as roots, tubers, stems, and leaves. Potatoes are tubers, which are part of the plant's root system.\n\n3. **Tomato**: \n   - **Category**: Fruit (Botanical), Vegetable (Culinary)\n   - **Criteria**: Botanically, tomatoes are fruits because they develop from the ovary of a flower and contain seeds.

They became a staple crop due to their nutritional value and adaptability to various climates.\n\n- **Tomato**: The classification of tomatoes has been debated historically. In 1893, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Nix v. Hedden that tomatoes should be classified as vegetables for tariff purposes, based on their culinary uses.
