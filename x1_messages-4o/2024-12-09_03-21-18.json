For example, if I'm in the directory /a/b and I want to print the full path to file c on the command-line so that I can easily paste it into another program: /a/b/c. I have created a sample Python implementation, abspath.py, for this purpose but is there a standard utility that already exists to achieve the same?\n\nHere's the sample Python implementation:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/python\n# Author: Diggory Hardy <diggory.hardy@gmail.com>\n# Licence: public domain\n# Purpose: print the absolute path of all input paths\n\nimport sys\nimport os.path\nif len(sys.argv)>1:\n    for i in range(1,len(sys.argv)):\n        print os.path.abspath( sys.argv[i] )\n    sys.exit(0)\nelse:\n    print >> sys.stderr, \"Usage: \",sys.argv[0],\" PATH.\"\n    sys.exit(1)\n```"

        "content": "Yes, there is a standard utility in Unix-like operating systems that can achieve this: the `realpath` command. This command is used to convert a specified path to its absolute path, resolving any symbolic links in the process if necessary.\n\nHere's how you can use `realpath`:\n\n```sh\nrealpath /path/to/file\n```\n\nFor example, to get the absolute path of a file named `c` in the current directory `/a/b`, you would simply run:\n\n```sh\nrealpath c\n```\n\nThis will output `/a/b/c`, assuming you're in the `/a/b` directory.\n\nIf `realpath` is not available on your system, you can also use `readlink -f` as an alternative, which often provides similar functionality:\n\n```sh\nreadlink -f /path/to/file\n```\n\nAgain, from the `/a/b` directory, you would run:\n\n```sh\nreadlink -f c\n```\n\nThese commands are widely available on Unix-like systems, and they should work in most modern Linux distributions and other similar environments."
