For instance, when iterating through groups, I can get the group key using the following tuple decomposition: \n```python\nfor group_name, subdf in temp_dataframe.groupby(level=0, axis=0):\n    print group_name\n```\nIs there a similar method to get the group name in the apply function, like this:\n```python\ntemp_dataframe.groupby(level=0,axis=0).apply(lambda group_name, subdf: foo(group_name, subdf)\n```\nHow can I access the group name as an argument for the apply lambda function?"

        "content": "In pandas, when you use the `apply()` function after a `groupby()`, the function receives only the sub-dataframe for each group as its argument. Unfortunately, there isn't a direct way to pass the group name as an argument within the lambda function in `apply()`. However, you can achieve this by using the `GroupBy` object's `apply` method along with a custom function that accesses the name attribute from the `GroupBy` object.\n\nHere's a way to do it by defining a custom function:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample data\ndata = {\n    'A': ['foo', 'bar', 'foo', 'bar'],\n    'B': [1, 2, 3, 4],\n    'C': [5, 6, 7, 8]\n}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Custom function that receives both group name and subdf\ndef custom_function(subdf):\n    group_name = subdf.name  # Access the group name\n    # Do something with group_name and subdf\n    print(f\"Group Name: {group_name}\")\n    print(subdf)\n    return subdf  # Or any transformation you want\n\n# Use groupby and apply the custom function\nresult = df.groupby('A').apply(custom_function)\n```\n\nIn this example, `subdf.name` gives you the group name inside the `custom_function`. You can then use `group_name` along with `subdf` to perform any operations you need."
