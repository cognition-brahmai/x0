The warning is from matplotlib and states: \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/matplotlib/__init__.py:872: UserWarning: axes.color_cycle is deprecated and replaced with axes.prop_cycle; please use the latter. warnings.warn(self.msg_depr % (key, alt_key))\". How can I suppress this warning? My system configuration is OSX with a brew Python 2.7.10 and I am using pandas version 0.17.0 and matplotlib version 1.5.0."

        "content": "To suppress the warning message from matplotlib, you can use Python's built-in `warnings` module to filter out specific warnings. In your case, you want to suppress the `UserWarning` regarding `axes.color_cycle`. You can do this by adding a few lines of code at the beginning of your script before you import pandas or matplotlib. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport warnings\n\n# Suppress specific warning from matplotlib\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=UserWarning, module=\"matplotlib\")\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Your remaining code\n```\n\nThis code uses `warnings.filterwarnings()` to ignore warnings of the `UserWarning` category that originate from the `matplotlib` module. By doing this, you won't see the deprecated warning message when importing pandas or matplotlib.\n\nIt's also worth noting that using an outdated version of Python (like 2.7) might not be ideal for long-term projects as Python 2.7 has reached the end of its life. Consider upgrading to Python 3.x for better support and features."
