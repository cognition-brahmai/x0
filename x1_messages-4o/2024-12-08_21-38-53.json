Subtract 4 from both sides of the equation to get:\n   \\[\n   7x + 4 - 4 = 38 - 4\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   7x = 34\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by 7 to solve for \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{34}{7}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{34}{7}\n\\]\nor approximately \\(x \\approx 4.857\\)."
