When I check what's defined with the dir function in a new interpreter session (IDLE), it seems like they have the same things. Is one an alias of the other? Are the Python team planning to remove one of these? Which one should I use in my programs? Does Python 3 handle these differently? I am currently using Python 2.7.2+ on Ubuntu."

        "content": "In Python, `__builtin__` and `__builtins__` refer to the built-in namespace, but they are used in slightly different contexts:\n\n1. **`__builtin__`**:\n   - This is the name of the module where built-in functions, exceptions, and objects are defined in Python 2. It is essentially a module that contains all the built-in identifiers.\n   - You can import this module explicitly using `import __builtin__` in Python 2.\n\n2. **`__builtins__`**:\n   - This is an implementation detail that refers to the built-in namespace. It is automatically available in the global namespace of a Python script.\n   - In the context of a script or interactive session, `__builtins__` is often set to the `__builtin__` module (in Python 2) or the `builtins` module (in Python 3).\n   - It can also be a dictionary that maps built-in names to their values.\n\nIn Python 3, the module name changed from `__builtin__` to `builtins`. However, `__builtins__` is still present and serves a similar purpose as in Python 2.\n\nRegarding your questions:\n- **Alias**: In Python 2, `__builtins__` often refers to `__builtin__`, but it can be a dictionary depending on the context. In Python 3, `__builtins__` often refers to `builtins`.\n- **Future Plans**: There is no indication that the Python team plans to remove `__builtins__`, as it is used internally by the interpreter.\n- **Usage**: It is generally recommended to use `builtins` (or `__builtin__` in Python 2) if you need to interact with the built-in namespace explicitly, as `__builtins__` is considered an implementation detail and may vary.\n- **Python 3**: Python 3 uses the `builtins` module instead of `__builtin__`, and `__builtins__` works the same way as in Python 2 but points to `builtins`.\n\nFor writing future-proof code, especially if you plan to transition to Python 3, it's better to rely on the `builtins` module rather than `__builtins__`."
