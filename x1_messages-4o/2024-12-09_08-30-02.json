The Python documentation suggests that a default formatter is used if a formatter isn't explicitly set. However, I can't find any clear statement specifying what this default format is."

        "content": "In Python's logging module, if you don't explicitly set a formatter for a handler, the default formatter is used, which typically outputs the log message with a simple format. The default format for log messages in Python's logging module is:\n\n```\n%(message)s\n```\n\nThis means that, by default, only the message that you pass to the logging call is printed, without any additional information such as the time, log level, or source of the log message. If you want more detailed information in your logs, you'll need to set a formatter explicitly.\n\nYou can customize the format by creating a `Formatter` object with a format string that includes various attributes, such as:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\n# Create a logger\nlogger = logging.getLogger('my_logger')\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\n# Create a console handler\nch = logging.StreamHandler()\nch.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\n# Create a formatter and set it for the handler\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nch.setFormatter(formatter)\n\n# Add the handler to the logger\nlogger.addHandler(ch)\n\n# Log messages\nlogger.debug('This is a debug message')\nlogger.info('This is an info message')\nlogger.warning('This is a warning message')\nlogger.error('This is an error message')\nlogger.critical('This is a critical message')\n```\n\nIn this example, the log messages will include the timestamp, logger name, log level, and the log message itself. You can adjust the format string to include other information as needed."
