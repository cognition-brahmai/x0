I'm trying to get the power spectrum of this \"signal\" with the right Axis. I have tried using the following code snippets but I don't believe I am getting the correct spectrum. How can I plot this signal in Hz?\n\nHere's the code I tried:\n\n```python\nX = fft(S_[:,2]);\npl.plot(abs(X))\npl.show()\n```\nand also:\n\n```python\nX = fft(S_[:,2]);\npl.plot(abs(X)**2)\npl.show()\n```\n\nThe signal I am working with, the spectrum and the power spectrum are shown in the images below:\n\nSignal: ![Signal](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MG8dz.jpg)\nSpectrum: ![Spectrum](https://i.stack.imgur.com/VU17P.jpg)\nPower Spectrum: ![Power Spectrum](https://i.stack.imgur.com/q8zQY.jpg)\n\nCan someone assist me in correctly plotting this spectrum in Hz?"

        "content": "To correctly plot the power spectrum of your signal in Hz, you need to ensure that the frequency axis is properly scaled. The frequency axis should represent the frequencies corresponding to the FFT components. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve that:\n\n1. **Compute the FFT**: You've already done this part by using `fft(S_[:,2])`.\n\n2. **Compute the Frequency Axis**: You need to create a frequency axis that matches the FFT components. Given that your movie clip runs at 30 frames per second (30 Hz), the Nyquist frequency (the highest frequency that can be accurately represented) is 15 Hz. This means your frequency axis should range from 0 to 15 Hz.\n\n3. **Plot the Spectrum**: You'll want to plot the FFT magnitudes (or power) against this frequency axis. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as pl\nfrom scipy.fft import fft, fftfreq\n\n# Assuming S_[:,2] is your signal\nsignal = S_[:,2]\nn = len(signal)\nsampling_rate = 30  # 30 Hz\n\n# Compute the FFT\nX = fft(signal)\n\n# Compute the frequency axis\nfreqs = fftfreq(n, d=1/sampling_rate)\n\n# Only take the positive frequencies (since the FFT output is symmetric)\npositive_freqs = freqs[:n // 2]\npositive_X = X[:n // 2]\n\n# Plot the magnitude spectrum\npl.figure()\npl.plot(positive_freqs, np.abs(positive_X))\npl.title(\"Frequency Spectrum\")\npl.xlabel(\"Frequency (Hz)\")\npl.ylabel(\"Magnitude\")\npl.show()\n\n# Plot the power spectrum\npl.figure()\npl.plot(positive_freqs, np.abs(positive_X)**2)\npl.title(\"Power Spectrum\")\npl.xlabel(\"Frequency (Hz)\")\npl.ylabel(\"Power\")\npl.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`fftfreq`**: This function generates the frequency bins for the FFT output. The `d` parameter is the inverse of the sampling rate, which is `1/30` for your case.\n- **Positive Frequencies**: Since the FFT output is symmetric, you only need to plot the first half, which corresponds to the positive frequencies.\n- **Plotting**: We plot the magnitude spectrum and power spectrum using `np.abs(X)` and `np.abs(X)**2`, respectively.\n\nThis approach should give you the correct frequency spectrum with the x-axis labeled in Hz."
