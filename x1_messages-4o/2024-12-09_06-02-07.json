        "content": "To set environment variables in a Pipenv environment for your Python project, you can use the `.env` file. Pipenv is designed to work seamlessly with Python projects, and it automatically loads environment variables from a `.env` file located in the root of your project directory. Here's how you can set it up:\n\n1. **Create a `.env` file**: In the root directory of your project (where your `Pipfile` is located), create a new file named `.env`.\n\n2. **Add your environment variables**: Open the `.env` file in a text editor and add your environment variables in the format `KEY=VALUE`. For example:\n\n   ```plaintext\n   ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token_here\n   ANOTHER_VARIABLE=another_value_here\n   ```\n\n3. **Automatically load the `.env` file**: Pipenv automatically loads the environment variables from the `.env` file when you run your project using `pipenv run` or when you activate the virtual environment using `pipenv shell`.\n\n4. **Access the environment variables in your Python code**: Use the `os` module to access the environment variables in your Python code. Here's an example:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n\n   access_token = os.getenv('ACCESS_TOKEN')\n   another_variable = os.getenv('ANOTHER_VARIABLE')\n\n   print(f\"Access Token: {access_token}\")\n   print(f\"Another Variable: {another_variable}\")\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, your environment variables will be automatically set every time you start the Pipenv environment, and you can access them in your Python code as needed."
