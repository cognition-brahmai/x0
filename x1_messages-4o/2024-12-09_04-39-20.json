My code is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nBOMoffset = pd.tseries.offsets.MonthBegin()\n# here some code sets the all_treatments dataframe and the newrowix, micolix, mocolix counters\nall_treatments.iloc[newrowix,micolix] = BOMoffset.rollforward(all_treatments.iloc[i,micolix] + pd.tseries.offsets.DateOffset(months = x))\nall_treatments.iloc[newrowix,micolix] = BOMoffset.rollforward(all_treatments.iloc[newrowix,micolix]+ pd.tseries.offsets.DateOffset(months = 1))\n```\n\nHere, `all_treatments.iloc[i,micolix]` is a datetime set by `pd.to_datetime(all_treatments['INDATUMA'], errors='coerce',format='%Y%m%d')`, and `INDATUMA` is date information in the format `20070125`. This logic seems to work on mock data (no errors, dates make sense), but it fails in my entire data with the following error: `pandas.tslib.OutOfBoundsDatetime: Out of bounds nanosecond timestamp: 2262-05-01 00:00:00`. How can I fix this?"

        "content": "The \"Out of bounds nanosecond timestamp\" error in pandas is typically triggered when you're attempting to work with a date that exceeds the range supported by pandas' datetime64[ns] dtype, which is approximately between 1677 and 2262. When you try to manipulate dates that go beyond this range, pandas throws an error.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Check for Invalid Dates**: Before applying any offsets, ensure that your data doesn't contain invalid or out-of-bounds dates. You can filter or clean your data to handle such cases.\n\n2. **Use Alternative Offsetting**: Instead of using `rollforward` directly on dates that might become out-of-bounds, you can handle them conditionally or use a different strategy to ensure they don't exceed the valid range.\n\n3. **Implement a Check**: Implement a check to ensure that any date manipulation doesn't exceed the valid range. You can do this by setting a maximum allowable date and adjusting the logic accordingly.\n\nHere's an example of how you could modify your code to include a check for out-of-bounds dates before applying the offset:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nBOMoffset = pd.tseries.offsets.MonthBegin()\n\nmax_date = pd.Timestamp.max\n\n# Function to safely add a month offset\ndef safe_add_months(date, months):\n    try:\n        new_date = BOMoffset.rollforward(date + pd.tseries.offsets.DateOffset(months=months))\n        if new_date > max_date:\n            return max_date\n        return new_date\n    except pd.errors.OutOfBoundsDatetime:\n        return max_date\n\nfor i in range(len(all_treatments)):\n    date = all_treatments.iloc[i, micolix]\n    if pd.notnull(date):\n        # Add the initial offset\n        new_date = safe_add_months(date, x)\n        # Assign the new date back to the DataFrame\n        all_treatments.iloc[newrowix, micolix] = new_date\n        \n        # Add another month\n        new_date = safe_add_months(new_date, 1)\n        all_treatments.iloc[newrowix, micolix] = new_date\n```\n\nThis code defines a `safe_add_months` function that attempts to add months to a given date. If the resulting date is out-of-bounds, it defaults to `pd.Timestamp.max`, ensuring that your program doesn't crash due to invalid timestamps. Adjust the logic as needed to suit your specific requirements."
