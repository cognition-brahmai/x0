I have two lists, [1,2,3,4] and [2,3,5], and I want to find the common elements, [2,3], and combine the rest of the elements together in a new list, [1,4,5]. I found from a post that I can find the common elements using set([1,2,3,4]&set([2,3,5]). But how can I retrieve non-common elements from each list, i.e., [1,4] and [5]? I tried using a for loop as shown below but it seems inefficient. Is there a more efficient way of doing this in Python?\n\n```python\nlists = [[1,2,3,4],[2,3,5]]\nconCommon = []\ncommon = [2,3]\nfor elem in lists:\n    for elem in eachList:\n    if elem not in common:\n        nonCommon += elem\n```"

        "content": "To find the non-common elements between two lists efficiently, you can utilize Python's set operations. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. First, convert both lists to sets.\n2. Find the intersection of the sets, which will give you the common elements.\n3. Use the difference operation to find non-common elements in each list.\n4. Combine the non-common elements from both lists.\n\nHere's the code to do that:\n\n```python\n# Define the two lists\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nlist2 = [2, 3, 5]\n\n# Convert lists to sets\nset1 = set(list1)\nset2 = set(list2)\n\n# Find common elements\ncommon_elements = set1 & set2\n\n# Find non-common elements\nnon_common_from_list1 = set1 - common_elements\nnon_common_from_list2 = set2 - common_elements\n\n# Combine non-common elements from both lists\nnon_common_combined = list(non_common_from_list1 | non_common_from_list2)\n\nprint(\"Common elements:\", list(common_elements))\nprint(\"Non-common elements combined:\", non_common_combined)\n```\n\nThis code efficiently finds the common elements using the intersection operator `&` and non-common elements using the difference operator `-`. The union operator `|` is used to combine non-common elements from both lists. This approach is more efficient than using a nested for loop as set operations are generally faster for these types of operations."
