        "content": "Yes, you can implement conditional logic within a `for` loop in Python using an `if` statement. Since Python does not support the `where` clause directly within a `for` loop like the pseudo-code you've shown, you can achieve similar functionality by including an `if` condition inside the loop. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfor item in items:\n    if item > 3:\n        # Your code here\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer a more concise approach, you can use a list comprehension to filter the items before iterating over them:\n\n```python\nfor item in (item for item in items if item > 3):\n    # Your code here\n```\n\nBoth methods will work in Python 2.7 and Python 3.3, allowing you to iterate over only those items that satisfy the condition `item > 3`."
