I have two dictionaries, x and y, defined as follows:\n\n```python\nx = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\ny = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n```\nI want to merge them into a new dictionary z so that if a key is present in both dictionaries, only the value from the second dictionary (y) is kept. The expected output for z is:\n\n```python\nz = {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n```"

        "content": "You can merge two dictionaries in Python and create a new dictionary in a single expression using the unpacking operator `**`. This approach allows you to combine the dictionaries, and if there are any overlapping keys, the values from the second dictionary will overwrite those from the first one. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nx = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\ny = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n\nz = {**x, **y}\n\nprint(z)\n```\n\nThis will give you the expected output:\n\n```python\n{'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n```\n\nIn this expression, `**x` unpacks the dictionary `x` and `**y` unpacks the dictionary `y`. When combined in `{**x, **y}`, the keys from `y` will overwrite the keys from `x` if they are the same."
