Currently, when I try to move a file that already exists in the destination folder, I get the following error: `shutil.Error: Destination path './dstFolder/file.txt' already exists`. Here is the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nimport shutil\nimport os\nsrc = 'scrFolder'\ndst = './dstFolder/'\nfilelist = []\n\nfiles = os.listdir( src )\nfor filename in files:\n    filelist.append(filename)\n    fullpath = src + '/' + filename\n    shutil.move(fullpath, dst)\n```"

        "content": "To modify your existing Python code so that it replaces files with the same name in the destination folder, you can use the `shutil.move()` function in combination with checking if the file already exists in the destination. If a file with the same name exists, you can remove it before moving the new file. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport shutil\nimport os\n\nsrc = 'srcFolder'\ndst = './dstFolder/'\n\nfiles = os.listdir(src)\nfor filename in files:\n    fullpath = os.path.join(src, filename)\n    destination_path = os.path.join(dst, filename)\n    \n    # Check if the file already exists in the destination\n    if os.path.exists(destination_path):\n        os.remove(destination_path)  # Remove the existing file\n\n    shutil.move(fullpath, dst)  # Move the file to the destination\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **os.path.join()**: This is used to create the full paths for the source and destination files. It helps to ensure that your code will work correctly on different operating systems by using the appropriate path separator.\n\n2. **os.path.exists()**: This checks if a file with the same name already exists in the destination directory.\n\n3. **os.remove()**: If a file with the same name exists, it is removed before moving the new file. This avoids the error you encountered.\n\nThis approach ensures that your files are moved successfully, even if a file with the same name already exists in the destination directory."
