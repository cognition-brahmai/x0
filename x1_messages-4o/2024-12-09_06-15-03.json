However, I encountered a PicklingError stating \"Can't pickle <class '__main__.P'>: it's not found as __main__.P\". I noticed that if I run the code without wrapping it inside a function, it executes flawlessly. Is there an additional step required to pickle a namedtuple object when it's defined inside a function? Here is the code I'm currently using:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nimport pickle\n\ndef pickle_test():\n    P = namedtuple(\"P\", \"one two three four\")\n    my_list = []\n    abe = P(\"abraham\", \"lincoln\", \"vampire\", \"hunter\")\n    my_list.append(abe)\n    with open('abe.pickle', 'wb') as f:\n        pickle.dump(abe, f)\n    \npickle_test()\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is because `pickle` needs to know where to find the class definition of the object you're trying to serialize. When you define a `namedtuple` inside a function, it becomes a local class and `pickle` cannot find it by its name, which causes the `PicklingError`.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to define the `namedtuple` outside of the function so that it is accessible as a top-level class. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nimport pickle\n\n# Define the namedtuple outside of the function\nP = namedtuple(\"P\", \"one two three four\")\n\ndef pickle_test():\n    my_list = []\n    abe = P(\"abraham\", \"lincoln\", \"vampire\", \"hunter\")\n    my_list.append(abe)\n    with open('abe.pickle', 'wb') as f:\n        pickle.dump(abe, f)\n\npickle_test()\n```\n\nBy defining `P` at the module level, `pickle` can correctly reference the location of the class, allowing it to serialize the object without any errors."
