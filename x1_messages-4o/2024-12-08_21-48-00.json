        "content": "To store a list of students in a school, a suitable data structure would be an **array** or a **list** (such as a Python list, Java ArrayList, or C++ vector), depending on the programming language you are using. This data structure allows you to store and access the information sequentially.\n\nIf you need to store more detailed information about each student, such as their name, age, grade, and other attributes, you could use an array or list of **objects** (or **dictionaries** in Python). Each object or dictionary would represent a student and contain key-value pairs for each attribute.\n\nFor example, in Python:\n\n```python\nstudents = [\n    {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 14, \"grade\": \"9\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 15, \"grade\": \"10\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Charlie\", \"age\": 13, \"grade\": \"8\"}\n]\n```\n\nOr in a more structured language like Java, you might define a `Student` class and then use an `ArrayList` to store instances of that class:\n\n```java\npublic class Student {\n    private String name;\n    private int age;\n    private String grade;\n\n    // Constructor, getters, and setters\n}\n\nList<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();\nstudents.add(new Student(\"Alice\", 14, \"9\"));\nstudents.add(new Student(\"Bob\", 15, \"10\"));\nstudents.add(new Student(\"Charlie\", 13, \"8\"));\n```\n\nThese data structures provide flexibility for accessing, adding, and manipulating student data effectively."
