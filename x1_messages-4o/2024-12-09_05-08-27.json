As part of the processing for each row, I need to remap the keys to user entered values which are provided in another dictionary. The mapping array is in the form: {badname1:goodname1, badname2:goodname2,...}. How can I effectively change the keys from the format {badname1:data1, badname2:data2,...} to {goodname1:data1, goodname2:data2,...}? I attempted using the zip() function but it yields {badname1:badname1,...}. I also tried using dict(zip(b,a.itervalues())) but it seems to only work when the fields are in the same order. How do I make the key mapping work regardless of the order of fields?"

        "content": "To remap the keys of each dictionary in your array using a mapping dictionary, you can iterate over each dictionary in your array and create a new dictionary with the keys remapped according to your mapping dictionary. Here's a step-by-step approach on how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Read the CSV File**: First, make sure you have read your CSV file into a list of dictionaries. You can use Python's `csv` module for this.\n\n2. **Use the Mapping Dictionary**: Use the mapping dictionary to remap the keys for each dictionary in your list.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet to demonstrate this:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\ndef read_csv_as_dicts(file_path):\n    with open(file_path, mode='r', newline='') as csvfile:\n        reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)\n        return [row for row in reader]\n\ndef remap_keys(data_list, mapping_dict):\n    remapped_data = []\n    for item in data_list:\n        remapped_item = {mapping_dict.get(key, key): value for key, value in item.items()}\n        remapped_data.append(remapped_item)\n    return remapped_data\n\n# Example usage:\ncsv_file_path = 'your_file.csv'\nmapping_dict = {'badname1': 'goodname1', 'badname2': 'goodname2'}  # Example mapping\n\n# Read CSV and get the data as a list of dictionaries\ndata_list = read_csv_as_dicts(csv_file_path)\n\n# Remap the keys using the mapping dictionary\nremapped_data_list = remap_keys(data_list, mapping_dict)\n\n# Output the remapped data\nfor data in remapped_data_list:\n    print(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Reading CSV**: The `read_csv_as_dicts` function reads the CSV file and returns a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a row in the CSV.\n- **Remapping Keys**: The `remap_keys` function goes through each dictionary in your data list. For each dictionary, it creates a new dictionary with keys remapped based on the `mapping_dict`. If a key in the original dictionary does not exist in the `mapping_dict`, it retains the original key.\n- **Efficiency**: This method ensures that the keys are remapped correctly regardless of their order in the original dictionaries.\n\nBy following this approach, you ensure that the key mapping is done accurately and consistently across all rows in your CSV file, and any keys not present in your mapping dictionary will remain unchanged."
