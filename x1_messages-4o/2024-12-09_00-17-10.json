        "content": "I am trying to pass multiple parameters to the pool.map() function in Python. As per my understanding, the target function of pool.map() can only have one iterable as a parameter. However, I need to pass in a few additional parameters, such as my Lock() and logging information, to the target function. I have tried to understand if I can use partial functions to solve this issue, but I couldn't fully grasp the concept. Could you provide me with a solution to this problem? Here is an example code to illustrate what I want to achieve:\n\n```python\ndef target(items, lock):\n    for item in items:\n        # Do cool stuff\n        if (... some condition here ...):\n            lock.acquire()\n            # Write to stdout or logfile, etc.\n            lock.release()\n\ndef main():\n    iterable = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    pool = multiprocessing.Pool()\n    pool.map(target(PASS PARAMS HERE), iterable)\n    pool.close()\n    pool.join()\n```"

        "content": "To pass multiple parameters to a target function when using `pool.map()`, you can use the `functools.partial` function to \"pre-fill\" some of the arguments for the target function. This way, `pool.map()` will handle the iterable, while the other parameters are held constant.\n\nHere's an example of how you can accomplish this:\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\nfrom functools import partial\n\ndef target(lock, item):\n    # Do cool stuff with item\n    if (... some condition here ...):\n        lock.acquire()\n        try:\n            # Write to stdout or logfile, etc.\n            print(f\"Processing item: {item}\")\n        finally:\n            lock.release()\n\ndef main():\n    iterable = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    lock = multiprocessing.Lock()\n\n    # Create a partial function with the lock pre-filled\n    target_with_lock = partial(target, lock)\n\n    # Use the partial function with pool.map()\n    with multiprocessing.Pool() as pool:\n        pool.map(target_with_lock, iterable)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`partial` Function**: The `functools.partial` function is used to create a new version of the `target` function where the `lock` parameter is pre-filled. This means that `pool.map()` will only need to supply the `item` from the iterable.\n\n- **`Lock` Usage**: The lock is used to ensure that only one process can write to stdout or a log file at a time, preventing mixed-up outputs.\n\n- **Context Manager for Pool**: Using `with multiprocessing.Pool() as pool:` ensures that the pool is properly closed and joined, even if an exception occurs.\n\nThis approach allows you to pass additional parameters to the function that `pool.map` calls without modifying the signature expected by `pool.map`."
