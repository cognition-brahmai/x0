        "content": "The Bellman-Ford algorithm is a classic algorithm used to find the shortest path from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. It can handle graphs with negative weight edges, making it more versatile than Dijkstra's algorithm, which cannot handle negative weights. However, Bellman-Ford is less efficient for graphs with only non-negative weights, as it has a time complexity of \\(O(V \\times E)\\), where \\(V\\) is the number of vertices and \\(E\\) is the number of edges.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step explanation of how the Bellman-Ford algorithm works and how it is implemented in the provided Java code:\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - Start by initializing the distance to the source node (`src`) as 0 and all other nodes as infinity (`Integer.MAX_VALUE` in Java) because initially, the shortest path to any node except the source itself is unknown.\n\n2. **Relaxation**:\n   - For each edge, update the distance to the destination node if the path through the source node plus the edge's weight is shorter than the current known distance to the destination node.\n   - This process is repeated \\(V-1\\) times (where \\(V\\) is the number of vertices) to ensure that the shortest paths are found.\n\n3. **Negative Cycle Detection**:\n   - After the \\(V-1\\) iterations, perform one more round of relaxation. If any distance can still be updated, it indicates the presence of a negative-weight cycle in the graph.\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - Finally, print out the shortest distance to each vertex from the source.\n\n### Java Code Explanation:\n\nThe provided Java code implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm using a `Graph` class with an inner `Edge` class. Each edge of the graph is defined with a source (`src`), destination (`dest`), and weight (`weight`). The `BellmanFord` method performs the algorithm, and the `printArr` method outputs the results.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key parts of the code:\n\n```java\n// Edge class to represent directed edges with a source, destination, and weight.\nclass Edge {\n    int src, dest, weight;\n    Edge() {\n        src = dest = weight = 0;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```java\n// Graph class containing the number of vertices (V) and edges (E), and an array of edges.\nclass Graph {\n    int V, E;\n    Edge edge[];\n    \n    Graph(int v, int e) {\n        V = v;\n        E = e;\n        edge = new Edge[e];\n        for (int i = 0; i < e; ++i)\n            edge[i] = new Edge();\n    }\n    \n    // Bellman-Ford algorithm implementation\n    void BellmanFord(Graph graph, int src) {\n        int V = graph.V, E = graph.E;\n        int dist[] = new int[V];\n        Arrays.fill(dist, Integer.MAX_VALUE); // Initialize distances\n        dist[src] = 0;\n\n        // Relaxation step\n        for (int i = 1; i < V; ++i) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < E; ++j) {\n                int u = graph.edge[j].src;\n                int v = graph.edge[j].dest;\n                int weight = graph.edge[j].weight;\n                if (dist[u] != Integer.MAX_VALUE && dist[u] + weight < dist[v])\n                    dist[v] = dist[u] + weight;\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Check for negative-weight cycles\n        for (int j = 0; j < E; ++j) {\n            int u = graph.edge[j].src;\n            int v = graph.edge[j].dest;\n            int weight = graph.edge[j].weight;\n            if (dist[u] != Integer.MAX_VALUE && dist[u] + weight < dist[v]) {\n                System.out.println(\"Negative cycles exist\");\n                return;\n            }\n        }\n\n        printArr(dist, V);\n    }\n\n    // Print the resulting shortest distances\n    void printArr(int dist[], int V) {\n        System.out.println(\"Vertex Distance from Source\");\n        for (int i = 0; i < V; ++i)\n            System.out.println(i + \"\\t\\t\" + dist[i]);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Main Method:\n\nThe `main` method creates a graph with 6 vertices and 8 edges and initializes each edge with its source, destination, and weight. The `BellmanFord` method is called with the source node set to 0 (which corresponds to node 1 in your example).\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int V = 6; // Number of vertices\n        int E = 8; // Number of edges\n        Graph graph = new Graph(V, E);\n\n        // Define edges with src, dest, and weight\n        graph.edge[0].src = 0;\n        graph.edge[0].dest = 1;\n        graph.edge[0].weight = 5;\n        graph.edge[1].src = 0;\n        graph.edge[1].dest = 2;\n        graph.edge[1].weight = 3;\n        graph.edge[2].src = 1;\n        graph.edge[2].dest = 3;\n        graph.edge[2].weight = 6;\n        graph.edge[3].src = 1;\n        graph.edge[3].dest = 2;\n        graph.edge[3].weight = 2;\n        graph.edge[4].src = 2;\n        graph.edge[4].dest = 4;\n        graph.edge[4].weight = 4;\n        graph.edge[5].src = 2;\n        graph.edge[5].dest = 5;\n        graph.edge[5].weight = 2;\n        graph.edge[6].src = 2;\n        graph.edge[6].dest = 3;\n        graph.edge[6].weight = 7;\n        graph.edge[7].src = 3;\n        graph.edge[7].dest = 5;\n        graph.edge[7].weight = 1;\n\n        // Execute Bellman-Ford algorithm from source vertex 0\n        graph.BellmanFord(graph, 0);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The graph is defined with vertices from 0 to 5, corresponding to nodes 1 to 6 in your example.\n- The algorithm processes each edge and updates the shortest path estimates.\n- Finally, the shortest path distances from node 1 (vertex 0 in the code) to all other nodes are printed.\n\nThis Java implementation effectively demonstrates how to find the shortest paths using the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
