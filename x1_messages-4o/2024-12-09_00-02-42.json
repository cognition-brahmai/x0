        "content": "To extract the main ideas from the given passage using Scala, you can follow a systematic approach as demonstrated in the code snippet. Here's a brief explanation of how the code works:\n\n1. **Tokenize the Text:** The text is split into sentences using a regular expression that identifies sentence-ending punctuation marks (such as periods, exclamation points, and question marks). The `split` method is utilized for this purpose.\n\n2. **Define Keywords:** A list of keywords is created. These keywords are crucial terms or phrases that represent the main ideas or themes in the passage.\n\n3. **Filter Sentences:** The filter function is used to iterate through the sentences and select those that contain one or more of the specified keywords. This involves checking if any of the keywords are present in each sentence.\n\n4. **Output the Main Ideas:** The sentences identified as containing main ideas are printed out. The `foreach` method is used to iterate over and display each of these sentences.\n\nHere\u2019s the Scala code in a structured manner:\n\n```scala\nval text = \"Humans have always looked up at the night sky with curiosity and awe. For thousands of years, we have attempted to capture the wonders of outer space by recording star patterns and exploring the mysteries of the unknown. We have also developed complex theories to explain our observations and formulated innovative techniques to advance our understanding.\"\n\n// Tokenize the text into sentences\nval sentences = text.split(\"[.!?\\n]+\")\n\n// Create a list of keywords\nval keywords = List(\"night sky\", \"outer space\", \"star patterns\", \"mysteries\", \"theories\", \"observations\", \"innovative techniques\", \"understanding\")\n\n// Identify sentences that contain one or more keywords\nval mainIdeas = sentences.filter(sentence => keywords.exists(keyword => sentence.contains(keyword)))\n\n// Print out the main ideas\nmainIdeas.foreach(println)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Tokenization:** `text.split(\"[.!?\\n]+\")` divides the text into individual sentences.\n- **Keywords:** The list `keywords` contains terms that are essential for identifying the main ideas.\n- **Filtering:** `sentences.filter` applies a condition to retain sentences that include any of the keywords.\n- **Output:** `mainIdeas.foreach(println)` prints each sentence that includes one or more keywords.\n\nThis approach effectively captures the key concepts discussed in the passage based on predefined keywords."
