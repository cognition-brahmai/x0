I've checked the 'cat' manual but didn't find any option for this. Could you suggest a command or a simple Bash program to achieve this?"

        "content": "To print a file in Bash while skipping the first X lines, you can use the `tail` command, which is designed to output the last part of files. By using the `-n` option with a plus sign (`+`), you can specify the starting line number from which to begin the output. Here's how you can skip the first 1,000,000 lines of a file:\n\n```bash\ntail -n +1000001 yourfile.txt\n```\n\nIn this command, `+1000001` tells `tail` to start printing from the 1,000,001st line, effectively skipping the first 1,000,000 lines.\n\nIf your file is extremely large and you are concerned about performance or memory usage, you might want to consider using `sed`, which is another tool that can handle this task efficiently:\n\n```bash\nsed '1,1000000d' yourfile.txt\n```\n\nThis `sed` command deletes lines 1 through 1,000,000 and prints the rest of the file to the standard output. Both methods should work efficiently for large files."
