This will help you identify which combinations of color and type have more than one entry, indicating similarity. Assuming the JSON data is stored in a SQL table named `produce` with columns `name`, `color`, `type`, and `shape`, the SQL query would look like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT color, type, COUNT(*) as count\nFROM produce\nGROUP BY color, type\nHAVING COUNT(*) > 1;\n```\n\nThis query will return the groups of produce items that share the same `color` and `type` and have more than one item in the group."
