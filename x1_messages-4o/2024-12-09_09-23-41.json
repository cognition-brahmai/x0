        "content": "To calculate the area of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides, you can use Heron's formula. Heron's formula states that if a triangle has sides of lengths \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and \\(s\\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle, then the area \\(A\\) of the triangle is given by:\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{a + b + c}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ A = \\sqrt{s \\cdot (s - a) \\cdot (s - b) \\cdot (s - c)} \\]\n\nHere's a Java program that implements this formula:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class TriangleAreaCalculator {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        // Prompt user for the lengths of the sides of the triangle\n        System.out.print(\"Enter the length of side a: \");\n        double a = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        System.out.print(\"Enter the length of side b: \");\n        double b = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        System.out.print(\"Enter the length of side c: \");\n        double c = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        // Check if the entered sides can form a triangle\n        if (isValidTriangle(a, b, c)) {\n            // Calculate the semi-perimeter\n            double s = (a + b + c) / 2;\n\n            // Calculate the area using Heron's formula\n            double area = Math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c));\n\n            // Display the result\n            System.out.printf(\"The area of the triangle is: %.2f\\n\", area);\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"The entered sides do not form a valid triangle.\");\n        }\n        \n        scanner.close();\n    }\n\n    // Method to check if the sides can form a valid triangle\n    private static boolean isValidTriangle(double a, double b, double c) {\n        return (a + b > c) && (a + c > b) && (b + c > a);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The program first prompts the user to input the lengths of the three sides of the triangle.\n- It checks if the provided sides can form a valid triangle using the triangle inequality theorem.\n- If valid, it calculates the semi-perimeter \\(s\\).\n- It then computes the area using Heron's formula.\n- Finally, it outputs the calculated area.\n\nThis program includes a validity check to ensure that the side lengths provided can form a triangle, adhering to the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side."
