        "content": "In IPython Notebook (now known as Jupyter Notebook), the output cell's default behavior is to limit the display size and add a scroll bar for larger outputs to prevent the notebook from becoming unwieldy. However, you can adjust this behavior by changing the notebook's configuration or using some JavaScript and CSS tricks. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Method 1: Adjusting the Notebook's Configuration\n\nYou can modify the `ipython_notebook_config.py` file to change the default behavior. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Locate the `ipython_notebook_config.py` file. If it doesn't exist, you can create one using the command:\n   ```bash\n   jupyter notebook --generate-config\n   ```\n\n2. Open the configuration file and add or modify the following line to set the scroll behavior:\n   ```python\n   c.NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit = 10000000\n   ```\n\n3. Save the file and restart your Jupyter Notebook server.\n\n### Method 2: Use CSS to Override the Default Behavior\n\nYou can add some custom CSS to your notebook to override the scroll behavior. Here\u2019s how:\n\n1. Open or create a file named `custom.css` in the Jupyter custom directory. You can find or create this directory with the following commands:\n   - On Linux or Mac: `~/.jupyter/custom/`\n   - On Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\\.jupyter\\custom\\`\n\n2. Add the following CSS code to the `custom.css` file:\n   ```css\n   .output_scroll {\n       height: auto !important;\n       max-height: none !important;\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. Save the file and refresh your Jupyter Notebook. This should apply the changes to all notebooks.\n\n### Method 3: Use Inline JavaScript in a Notebook Cell\n\nIf you prefer not to change the configuration files, you can also use inline JavaScript in a notebook cell:\n\n1. Add a new code cell in your notebook and paste the following JavaScript code:\n   ```python\n   from IPython.core.display import display, HTML\n\n   display(HTML('''\n       <style>\n           .output_scroll {\n               height: auto !important;\n               max-height: none !important;\n           }\n       </style>\n   '''))\n   ```\n\n2. Run the cell. This will apply the CSS changes to the current notebook session.\n\nThese methods should help you view larger outputs without a scroll bar in Jupyter Notebooks. Adjusting these settings can make it easier to view outputs, but be cautious if you are working with very large datasets, as it may affect the performance of the notebook."
