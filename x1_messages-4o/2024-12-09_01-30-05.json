        "content": "I have defined a Python class called `Listener` with a `id` attribute and a `artists` list attribute. I have also created a dictionary of `Listener` objects, and each listener has an `id` to identify them and a list of `artists` they listen to. However, when I add something to the `artists` list, it gets added across all instances of the `Listener` class, rather than just the referred instance. Why is this happening and how can I achieve the desired output where each instance has its own `artists` list?\n\nHere is the `Listener` class:\n```python\nclass Listener:\n    id = \"\"\n    artists = []\n\n    def __init__(self, id):\n        self.id = id\n\n    def addArtist(self, artist, plays):\n        print self.id # debugging...\n        print \"pre: \", self.artists\n        self.artists.append(artist)\n        print \"post: \", self.artists\n```\n\nAnd here is the debugging test code:\n```python\ndef debug():\n    listeners = {}\n    listeners[\"0\"] = Listener(\"0\")\n    listeners[\"1\"] = Listener(\"1\")\n\n    listeners[\"0\"].addArtist(\"The Beatles\", 10)\n    listeners[\"0\"].addArtist(\"Lady Gaga\", 4)\n    listeners[\"1\"].addArtist(\"Ace of Base\", 5)\n```\n\nThe output I'm getting is:\n```python\n0\npre:  []\npost:  ['The Beatles']\n0\npre:  ['The Beatles']\npost:  ['The Beatles', 'Lady Gaga']\n1\npre:  ['The Beatles', 'Lady Gaga']\npost:  ['The Beatles', 'Lady Gaga', 'Ace of Base']\n```\n\nBut the expected output is:\n```python\n1\npre:  []\npost:  ['Ace of Base']\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is due to the fact that the `artists` list is defined as a class attribute rather than an instance attribute. Class attributes are shared among all instances of the class, which is why changes to `artists` are reflected across all `Listener` instances. To ensure that each instance has its own separate `artists` list, you need to define it as an instance attribute within the `__init__` method.\n\nHere's the corrected version of your `Listener` class:\n\n```python\nclass Listener:\n    def __init__(self, id):\n        self.id = id\n        self.artists = []  # Now each instance will have its own artists list\n\n    def addArtist(self, artist, plays):\n        print(self.id)  # debugging...\n        print(\"pre: \", self.artists)\n        self.artists.append(artist)\n        print(\"post: \", self.artists)\n\ndef debug():\n    listeners = {}\n    listeners[\"0\"] = Listener(\"0\")\n    listeners[\"1\"] = Listener(\"1\")\n\n    listeners[\"0\"].addArtist(\"The Beatles\", 10)\n    listeners[\"0\"].addArtist(\"Lady Gaga\", 4)\n    listeners[\"1\"].addArtist(\"Ace of Base\", 5)\n\n# Run the debug function to see the results\ndebug()\n```\n\nWith this change, each `Listener` instance will have its own unique `artists` list, and the output will reflect the expected behavior:\n\n```plaintext\n0\npre:  []\npost:  ['The Beatles']\n0\npre:  ['The Beatles']\npost:  ['The Beatles', 'Lady Gaga']\n1\npre:  []\npost:  ['Ace of Base']\n```"
