I am using the following code where I am generating random integers between 500 and 5000 and adding them to a list. If a duplicate is found, I raise an exception. However, I am noticing that I am getting duplicates quite often, sometimes as early as the 7th iteration. I tried this multiple times and the most I could go before encountering a duplicate was 121 iterations. Is this the best sort of result I can expect from the standard library?\n\nHere's the code I've used:\n```python\nfrom random import randint\nuniques = []\nfor i in range(4500):  # You can see I was optimistic.\n    x = randint(500, 5000)\n    if x in uniques:\n        raise Exception('We duped %d at iteration number %d' % (x, i))\n    uniques.append(x)\n```\nThe error I get is:\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 4, in <module>\nException: We duped 887 at iteration number 7\n```"

        "content": "Your observation of encountering duplicates is not surprising given the nature of randomness and the range you've set. The `randint` function generates pseudo-random numbers, and when generating a large number of random integers from a relatively small range, duplicates are statistically likely to occur.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening:\n\n1. **Range Size and Randomness**: You are generating numbers between 500 and 5000, which gives you a range of 4501 possible unique values. The probability of encountering a duplicate increases as you approach the size of the range because you're drawing without replacement.\n\n2. **Birthday Paradox**: This situation is similar to the birthday paradox, where the probability of two people sharing a birthday becomes significant even with a relatively small group size compared to the number of possible birthdays (365 days). Similarly, in your case, as you generate more numbers, the chances of a collision (duplicate) grow.\n\n3. **Expected Duplicates**: Statistically, you can expect to start seeing duplicates after generating around the square root of the range size. For a range of 4501, this is approximately 67, which aligns with your observation of encountering duplicates after relatively few iterations.\n\nIf you need a large number of unique random integers, consider using the `random.sample` function, which generates a list of unique random numbers without replacement:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nuniques = random.sample(range(500, 5001), 4500)\n```\n\nThis code will generate 4500 unique numbers between 500 and 5000 without any duplicates. Note that the upper bound in `range` is exclusive, so I've used 5001 to include 5000."
