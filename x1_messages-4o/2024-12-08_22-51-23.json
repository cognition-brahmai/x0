The International Date Line is approximately along the 180th meridian, but it deviates in certain places to accommodate political and geographic considerations. The Arctic Circle is located at approximately 66.5 degrees north latitude.\n\nThe exact intersection point is at 66.5\u00b0N latitude and 180\u00b0 longitude. However, due to the International Date Line's deviations, this can vary slightly based on the specific mapping or geopolitical context used. In general, it occurs in a remote area of the Arctic Ocean, far from any landmass."
