Your aim is to ascertain the sequence of runners crossing the finish line based on the number of calories burnt by each of them while running 1 km. Your task involves the following details: \n- Runner A weighs 60 kg and runs at a speed of 10 km/h. \n- Runner B weighs 80 kg and runs at a speed of 8 km/h.\n- Runner C weighs 70 kg and runs at a speed of 12 km/h.\n- Your weight and running speed remain unknown.\nTo determine the order of runners, you must determine the amount of calories burnt, which is directly proportional to the product of weight and running speed. However, you cannot utilize any pre-existing formulas or calculations. Your task requires you to use ratios and proportions to compare the number of calories burnt by each runner, leading to a multistep reasoning process."

Let's analyze the given data for each runner:\n\n1. **Runner A:**\n   - Weight: 60 kg\n   - Speed: 10 km/h\n   - Calories burnt \u221d 60 kg * 10 km/h = 600 units\n\n2. **Runner B:**\n   - Weight: 80 kg\n   - Speed: 8 km/h\n   - Calories burnt \u221d 80 kg * 8 km/h = 640 units\n\n3. **Runner C:**\n   - Weight: 70 kg\n   - Speed: 12 km/h\n   - Calories burnt \u221d 70 kg * 12 km/h = 840 units\n\nNow, we compare the proportional values of calories burnt:\n\n- **Runner A: 600 units**\n- **Runner B: 640 units**\n- **Runner C: 840 units**\n\nThe order of runners based on the calories burnt (from highest to lowest) is:\n\n1. Runner C (840 units)\n2. Runner B (640 units)\n3. Runner A (600 units)\n\nTherefore, based on the calories burnt, Runner C would cross the finish line first, followed by Runner B, and then Runner A."
