Additionally, provide an example of a species that has undergone natural selection and describe the specific adaptations that have arisen. Use the table below to compare and contrast the differences between natural selection and other evolutionary processes such as artificial selection and genetic engineering. Finally, provide a code snippet in a programming language of your choice that simulates natural selection in a population of organisms, taking into account factors such as mutation rates, fitness levels, and environmental pressures."

Genetic drift causes random allele frequency changes, while gene flow introduces new genes between populations. Together, they drive adaptive evolution.\n\n**Example of Natural Selection:**\n\nThe peppered moth (Biston betularia) in England evolved darker coloration during the Industrial Revolution due to pollution, which provided camouflage against predators.\n\n**Comparison Table:**\n\n| **Aspect**                | **Natural Selection**                               | **Artificial Selection**                            | **Genetic Engineering**                          |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| **Definition**            | Differential survival and reproduction of organisms | Human-mediated breeding for desired traits          | Direct manipulation of an organism's genome     |\n| **Driving Force**         | Environmental pressures                             | Human preferences                                   | Human intervention with genetic tools           |\n| **Genetic Variation**     | Random mutations, recombination                     | Selected traits from existing genetic variation     | Introduction of specific genes                  |\n| **Time Scale**            | Gradual, over generations                           | Can be rapid, depending on breeding cycles          | Potentially rapid, depending on the technology  |\n| **Outcome**               | Increased fitness in a given environment            | Traits beneficial for humans                        | Specific desired traits or corrections          |\n\n**Code Snippet (Python):**\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nclass Organism:\n    def __init__(self, fitness):\n        self.fitness = fitness\n\ndef simulate_natural_selection(pop_size, generations, mutation_rate, env_pressure):\n    population = [Organism(fitness=random.uniform(0, 1)) for _ in range(pop_size)]\n\n    for gen in range(generations):\n        # Selection based on fitness\n        population = sorted(population, key=lambda x: x.fitness, reverse=True)\n        survivors = population[:int(env_pressure * pop_size)]\n\n        # Reproduction with mutation\n        offspring = []\n        for org in survivors:\n            if random.random() < mutation_rate:\n                new_fitness = min(max(org.fitness + random.uniform(-0.1, 0.1), 0), 1)\n            else:\n                new_fitness = org.fitness\n            offspring.append(Organism(fitness=new_fitness))\n\n        # New generation\n        population = offspring\n\n    return population\n\n# Simulate the process\nfinal_population = simulate_natural_selection(pop_size=100, generations=50, mutation_rate=0.05, env_pressure=0.5)\n\n# Output final fitness levels\nfor org in final_population:\n    print(f'Fitness: {org.fitness:.2f}')\n```\n\nThis code simulates a simplified natural selection process, illustrating how mutation rates and environmental pressures influence the evolution of a population's fitness over generations."
