        "content": "I have written a recursive function in Python to generate a sequence with nontrivial constraints. For smaller inputs, this function works well but for larger inputs, it generates several thousands of sequences. Therefore, I want to convert this function into a generator instead of using it to fill a list with all the sequences. Currently, my function takes an extra argument 'storage' and appends a permutation to it whenever it finds one, like this:\n\n```python\ndef getPermutations(string, storage, prefix=\"\"):\n   if len(string) == 1:\n      storage.append(prefix + string)\n   else:\n      for i in range(len(string)):\n         getPermutations(string[:i]+string[i+1:], storage, prefix+string[i])\n\nstorage = []\ngetPermutations(\"abcd\", storage)\nfor permutation in storage: print permutation\n```\n\nI tried to convert the function into a generator by using 'yield' instead of appending to the 'storage' list, but it doesn't work as expected. The function behaves like an empty generator. Here is the modified code:\n\n```python\ndef getPermutations(string, prefix=\"\"):\n   if len(string) == 1:\n      yield prefix + string\n   else:\n      for i in range(len(string)):\n         getPermutations(string[:i]+string[i+1:], prefix+string[i])\n\nfor permutation in getPermutations(\"abcd\"):\n   print permutation\n```\nAm I missing something? Is there a way to turn the above recursive algorithm into a generator without replacing it with an iterative one?"

        "content": "The issue with your modified code is that you are not actually yielding the results from the recursive calls. When you use `yield` in a recursive generator function, you need to explicitly yield the results from the recursive call. You can do this by using a `yield from` statement, which delegates part of its operations to another generator.\n\nHere's how you can modify your function to work as a generator:\n\n```python\ndef getPermutations(string, prefix=\"\"):\n    if len(string) == 1:\n        yield prefix + string\n    else:\n        for i in range(len(string)):\n            # Use 'yield from' to yield all values from the recursive call\n            yield from getPermutations(string[:i] + string[i+1:], prefix + string[i])\n\n# Now you can iterate over the generator and print each permutation\nfor permutation in getPermutations(\"abcd\"):\n    print(permutation)\n```\n\nWith the `yield from` statement, the function will correctly yield all permutations generated by the recursive calls. This allows you to use the function as a generator, generating each permutation one-by-one, which is especially useful for handling large inputs without consuming a lot of memory."
