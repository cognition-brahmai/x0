However, the \"list + x\" only works if 'x' is also a list, which is clearly mentioned in the Python documentation. Could you provide any references or explanations for this?\n\nExample code:\n\n```\nIn [6]: l = []\n\nIn [7]: l += [1]\n\nIn [8]: l += (2, 3)\n\nIn [9]: l += xrange(5)\n\nIn [10]: l\nOut[10]: [1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n```"

        "content": "The behavior you've observed with the `+=` operator when used with lists in Python is indeed part of Python's design, although it might not be as explicitly documented as some other behaviors. Here's an explanation of what's going on:\n\n1. **`+=` Operator on Lists**: \n   - The `+=` operator, when used with a list, is an in-place addition that modifies the list by extending it with the elements of the iterable on the right-hand side. This operation is equivalent to using the `extend()` method of a list.\n   - Therefore, when you do `l += (2, 3)` or `l += xrange(5)`, Python internally calls `l.extend((2, 3))` or `l.extend(xrange(5))`. The `extend()` method is designed to accept any iterable, which is why `+=` works with tuples, generators, and other iterables.\n\n2. **`+` Operator on Lists**:\n   - The `+` operator, on the other hand, is not in-place and returns a new list. It requires both operands to be lists because it concatenates the two lists and returns a new list.\n   - This is why `l + x` only works if `x` is also a list. If `x` is not a list, Python raises a `TypeError`.\n\n### Documentation Reference\n\nWhile the Python documentation doesn't explicitly state that `+=` works with any iterable, it can be inferred from the `list.extend()` method documentation. The [list.extend()](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists) method is described in the Python documentation as:\n\n> `list.extend(iterable)`:\n> Extend the list by appending all the items from the iterable. Equivalent to `a[len(a):] = iterable`.\n\nThis implies that any iterable can be used with `extend()`, and since `l += iterable` is essentially `l.extend(iterable)`, it follows the same logic.\n\nFor more details, you can explore the Python language reference, particularly sections about sequence types and list methods, which should help you understand the behavior of these operators."
