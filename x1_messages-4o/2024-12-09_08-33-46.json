        "content": "The error message you're encountering suggests that Sublime Text 2 is having trouble finding the `__main__` module when attempting to run your Python script. This issue typically arises from a misconfiguration in the build system settings that Sublime Text uses to execute Python code.\n\nHere's how you can address and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check the Build System**:\n   - Make sure Sublime Text is set to use the correct build system for Python. Go to `Tools` > `Build System` and ensure that `Python` is selected.\n\n2. **Modify the Python Build System**:\n   - You might need to create or modify the Python build system to explicitly point to your Python 2.7.3 installation.\n   - Go to `Tools` > `Build System` > `New Build System\u2026`.\n\n3. **Create a Custom Build System**:\n   - In the new file that opens, replace the contents with the following configuration:\n\n     ```json\n     {\n         \"cmd\": [\"/usr/bin/python\", \"-u\", \"$file\"],\n         \"file_regex\": \"^[ ]*File \\\"(...*?)\\\", line ([0-9]*)\",\n         \"selector\": \"source.python\"\n     }\n     ```\n\n   - Make sure that the path `\"/usr/bin/python\"` is correct for your Python 2.7.3 installation. You can verify by running `which python` in the terminal to get the correct path.\n\n4. **Save the Build System**:\n   - Save this file with a `.sublime-build` extension, for example, `Python2.sublime-build`.\n\n5. **Select the New Build System**:\n   - Go back to `Tools` > `Build System` and select the newly created build system (e.g., `Python2`).\n\n6. **Try Running Your Script Again**:\n   - Open your Python script in Sublime Text and try running it again using `Cmd + B`.\n\nBy following these steps, Sublime Text should be able to correctly locate and execute your Python script using the appropriate Python interpreter, and the error should be resolved."
