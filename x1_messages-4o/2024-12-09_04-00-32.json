I tried importing it like this:\n\n```python\nfrom models.hello import Hello\n```\n\nWhile this works when I run the app, I get an error in the Python extension of VSCode saying `E0401:Unable to import 'models.hello'`. What is the proper way of importing a submodule from the same directory? How do I avoid this error in VSCode?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to how Python handles module imports and how VSCode's Python extension checks for imports. The error message `E0401: Unable to import 'models.hello'` typically indicates that the linter or VSCode's Python extension isn't able to resolve the import path correctly, even though it works when you run the code. This is often due to the way the Python environment or workspace is configured in VSCode.\n\nHere are a few steps to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check VSCode Workspace Settings:**\n   Make sure that you have opened the correct folder in VSCode that contains the `myapp` directory. You should open the parent directory of `myapp` in VSCode as your workspace folder, not directly the `myapp` folder.\n\n2. **Configure Python Path:**\n   Ensure that your Python interpreter in VSCode is set to the correct environment. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P`, typing `Python: Select Interpreter`, and selecting the appropriate environment.\n\n3. **Add `myapp` to PYTHONPATH:**\n   You can modify the `PYTHONPATH` so that Python and VSCode can properly resolve the import paths. This can be done by adding a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following line:\n   \n   ```plaintext\n   PYTHONPATH=.\n   ```\n\n   Alternatively, you can modify the `launch.json` file in the `.vscode` directory to include the `PYTHONPATH`:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n     \"configurations\": [\n       {\n         \"name\": \"Python: Current File\",\n         \"type\": \"python\",\n         \"request\": \"launch\",\n         \"program\": \"${file}\",\n         \"console\": \"integratedTerminal\",\n         \"env\": {\"PYTHONPATH\": \"${workspaceFolder}\"}\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Relative Imports:**\n   Consider using relative imports within the `models` directory if it's part of a package. In `world.py`, you can change the import to:\n\n   ```python\n   from .hello import Hello\n   ```\n\n   This assumes that your `models` directory is treated as a package with an `__init__.py` file in it (even if it's empty).\n\n5. **Verify and Restart:**\n   After making these changes, restart VSCode to ensure all configurations are applied. Also, ensure there are no other issues in the VSCode terminal or output that might give further hints.\n\nThese steps should help VSCode resolve the import paths correctly and eliminate the `E0401` error."
