Note: Actual implementation will depend on the structure of the website, and you must adhere to the terms of service of any website you scrape.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nfrom textblob import TextBlob\n\n# URL of the top-rated TV show review page\nurl = 'https://www.example.com/top-rated-tv-show-reviews'\n\n# Fetch the page\nresponse = requests.get(url)\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')\n\n# Extract review elements (Modify the selector based on actual website structure)\nreviews = soup.find_all(class_='review-text')\n\n# Sentiment analysis\nfor review in reviews:\n    text = review.get_text()\n    blob = TextBlob(text)\n    sentiment = blob.sentiment\n    print(f\"Review: {text}\")\n    print(f\"Sentiment: Polarity: {sentiment.polarity}, Subjectivity: {sentiment.subjectivity}\")\n\n# Note: Ensure compliance with the website's 'robots.txt' and terms of use.\n```\n\n### Important Note\n- **Ethical Scraping:** Always ensure that web scraping is performed ethically and legally. Check the website's `robots.txt` file and terms of service for guidelines on automated data collection.\n- **API Use:** If the website provides an API, prefer using it for data access to ensure compliance and reliability."
