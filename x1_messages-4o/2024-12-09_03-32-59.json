I initially thought timedelta would be useful if it had a month argument in its constructor. Really, I just need any day in the last month because eventually I'm going to grab the year and month only."

Here's a simple method to achieve that:\n\n1. Use the `relativedelta` function from `dateutil.relativedelta` to subtract one month from your existing datetime object.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta\n\ndef get_previous_month_date(date):\n    # Subtract one month from the given date\n    previous_month_date = date - relativedelta(months=1)\n    return previous_month_date\n\n# Example usage\ncurrent_date = datetime.now()\nprevious_month_date = get_previous_month_date(current_date)\nprint(f\"Current Date: {current_date}\")\nprint(f\"Previous Month Date: {previous_month_date}\")\n```\n\nThis approach will correctly handle the transition between months, including edge cases like going from March 31st to February (taking into account leap years). The `relativedelta` function is quite flexible and can be used to add or subtract other time periods as well."
