        "content": "I have a function in Python that returns None or a tuple based on a flag. When I try to unpack the returned values into variables, I get a TypeError when the function returns None. The current solution involves catching the TypeError or checking if the returned value is not None before unpacking. Is there a better way to handle this situation, so I can set both variables to None without having to return (None, None) from the function? Any suggestions on design strategies in such cases? \n\nHere is my current code:\n\n```python\ndef foo(flag):\n    if flag:\n        return (1,2)\n    else:\n        return None\n\nfirst, second = foo(True)\nfirst, second = foo(False)\n```\n\nAnd the current workaround:\n\n```python\nvalues = foo(False)\nif values is not None:\n    first, second = values\n```"

        "content": "To handle the situation where a function may return `None` or a tuple, and you want to unpack the values without encountering a `TypeError`, you can use a default assignment strategy. This approach allows you to safely attempt unpacking while setting default values when the function returns `None`. Here's one way to achieve that:\n\n```python\ndef foo(flag):\n    if flag:\n        return (1, 2)\n    else:\n        return None\n\n# Unpack with default values using a conditional expression\nresult = foo(True)\nfirst, second = result if result is not None else (None, None)\n\nprint(first, second)  # Output: 1, 2\n\nresult = foo(False)\nfirst, second = result if result is not None else (None, None)\n\nprint(first, second)  # Output: None, None\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Conditional Expression**: The expression `result if result is not None else (None, None)` checks if `result` is not `None`. If it's not `None`, it unpacks the tuple into `first` and `second`. Otherwise, it assigns `None` to both `first` and `second`.\n  \nThis method is clean and doesn't require changes to the function itself. By handling the unpacking this way, you keep function output flexible and ensure that variables are safely initialized without explicitly returning `(None, None)` from the function."
