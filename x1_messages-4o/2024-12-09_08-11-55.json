        "content": "To sort a NumPy array by its nth column, you can use the `numpy.argsort()` function along with array slicing. Here's how you can achieve the desired result for your specific example:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([[9, 2, 3],\n              [4, 5, 6],\n              [7, 0, 5]])\n\n# Specify the column index you want to sort by (0-indexed). For the second column, it is 1.\ncolumn_index = 1\n\n# Get the indices that would sort the array by the specified column\nsorted_indices = np.argsort(a[:, column_index])\n\n# Use these indices to sort the array\nsorted_array = a[sorted_indices]\n\nprint(sorted_array)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n[[7 0 5]\n [9 2 3]\n [4 5 6]]\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what happens in the code:\n\n1. `a[:, column_index]` selects all the rows of the array `a` but only for the specified column (in this case, the second column).\n\n2. `np.argsort(a[:, column_index])` returns the indices that would sort the array based on the specified column.\n\n3. `a[sorted_indices]` reorders the rows of `a` using the sorted indices, resulting in the sorted array you want."
