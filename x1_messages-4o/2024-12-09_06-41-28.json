I would like a certain feature to be activated only if its corresponding setting exists. \n\nHere is the code I currently have:\n\nsettings.py:\n\n```\nSOME_VARIABLE = 'some-string'\nANOTHER_VARIABLE = 'another-string'\n```\n\nrandom_code_file.py:\n\n```\nfrom django.conf import settings\n\nif settings.is_defined('ANOTHER_VARIABLE'): \n    do_something(settings.ANOTHER_VARIABLE)\nelse:\n    do_something_completely_different()\n```\n\nIn the above code, I am unsure of what to replace `settings.is_defined` with. I'm looking for an answer that avoids using a `try/except` block and avoids setting a special value such as a blank string or `None` to indicate the absence of the feature."

        "content": "In Django, to check if a settings variable is defined, you can use the `hasattr()` function. This method allows you to check if an attribute exists on an object. In this case, you can use it to check if a particular setting is defined in your `settings.py` file.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nfrom django.conf import settings\n\nif hasattr(settings, 'ANOTHER_VARIABLE'): \n    do_something(settings.ANOTHER_VARIABLE)\nelse:\n    do_something_completely_different()\n```\n\nIn this updated code, `hasattr(settings, 'ANOTHER_VARIABLE')` checks if `ANOTHER_VARIABLE` is defined in your settings. If it is, the `do_something()` function is called with `ANOTHER_VARIABLE`, otherwise, it falls back to `do_something_completely_different()`. This way, you avoid using a `try/except` block or setting a special value to indicate the absence of a feature."
