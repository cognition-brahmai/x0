I've read in the Python documentation that the lowest valued entries are retrieved first and that the typical pattern for entries is a tuple in the form of (priority_number, data). However, my understanding is that the queue will be sorted by priority then data, which may not always be correct. For instance, if data \"item 2\" is enqueued before \"item 1\", item 1 will still go first. I've also noticed another documentation page on 'heapq' that suggests the use of a counter. So, I'm considering storing my data like entry = [priority, count, task]. I'm wondering if there is a simpler way to do this, like using PriorityQueue.put(item, priority), so that I don't need to implement the ordering myself?"

        "content": "In Python, the `PriorityQueue` class from the `queue` module indeed requires you to manage the priority and the order of insertion yourself, as it doesn't provide a direct method like `put(item, priority)`. However, you can achieve your desired behavior by combining priority with a counter, which you increment each time you add a new item, to maintain the order of insertion for items with the same priority.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Use a Tuple for Entries**: Store each item as a tuple `(priority, count, task)`. The `priority` is the primary sorting key, and `count` serves as a tie-breaker for items with the same priority. The `task` is your actual data.\n\n2. **Use a Counter**: Maintain a counter variable that increments with each insertion. This ensures that items with the same priority maintain the order in which they were added.\n\n3. **Use the `heapq` Module**: You can use the `heapq` module directly if you don't need the thread-safe features of `PriorityQueue`. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\nclass PriorityQueue:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.pq = []  # list of entries arranged in a heap\n        self.counter = 0  # unique sequence count\n\n    def put(self, item, priority):\n        # Create an entry tuple and add it to the heap\n        entry = (priority, self.counter, item)\n        heapq.heappush(self.pq, entry)\n        self.counter += 1\n\n    def get(self):\n        # Remove and return the lowest priority task\n        if self.pq:\n            priority, count, task = heapq.heappop(self.pq)\n            return task\n        else:\n            raise KeyError('pop from an empty priority queue')\n\n    def is_empty(self):\n        return len(self.pq) == 0\n\n# Example usage\npq = PriorityQueue()\npq.put(\"item 1\", priority=1)\npq.put(\"item 2\", priority=1)\npq.put(\"item 3\", priority=0)\n\nwhile not pq.is_empty():\n    print(pq.get())\n```\n\nIn this example, `\"item 3\"` will be retrieved first because it has the highest priority (lowest priority number). `\"item 1\"` will be retrieved before `\"item 2\"` because it was inserted first, even though they have the same priority.\n\nBy using this method, you maintain both the priority and the order of insertion without requiring a complex implementation."
