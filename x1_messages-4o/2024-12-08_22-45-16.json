Here are two questions that can help uncover potential customer needs:\n\n1. \"What challenges or pain points are you currently facing in your [specific area of interest or industry] that you wish could be addressed more effectively?\"\n   \n   This question allows the customer to share specific problems they encounter, providing insights into their needs and expectations. It helps you understand where there might be gaps in the current solutions available to them.\n\n2. \"If you could have an ideal solution or product to improve your experience in [specific area], what features or capabilities would it include?\"\n\n   By asking this, you encourage the customer to think creatively about their ideal solution, revealing their priorities and the features they value most. This can guide you in tailoring your offerings to better meet their expectations.\n\nBoth questions aim to delve deeper into the customer's perspective and uncover needs that may not be immediately obvious."
