        "content": "In Python, you cannot directly concatenate a string and an integer using the `+` operator because they are of different data types. The `+` operator expects both operands to be of the same type when it comes to concatenation. Since one is a string and the other is an integer, Python throws a `TypeError`.\n\nTo concatenate a string and a number, you need to convert the number to a string first. You can do this using the `str()` function. Here\u2019s how you can concatenate a string and a number correctly:\n\n```python\nresult = \"abc\" + str(9)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nabc9\n```\n\nAlternatively, you could use formatted strings (also known as f-strings) which were introduced in Python 3.6. This method is often more readable, especially when dealing with more complex strings:\n\n```python\nnumber = 9\nresult = f\"abc{number}\"\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will also output:\n\n```\nabc9\n```\n\nBoth methods will achieve the desired result by converting the integer to a string before concatenation."
