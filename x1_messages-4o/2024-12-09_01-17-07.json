After running for a full day, it uses about 6GB of RAM and my system starts to swap. I tried tracing the memory leaks using a guide that I found online and the most common types that I see (with only 800M of memory used) do not show anything unusual. I also tried some recommendations, ran the program overnight and found that it used 4G of RAM. The printed summary from pympler does not sum to 4G nor does it provide any large data structures to fix. The unicode is from a set() of \"done\" nodes, and the lists seem to be random weakrefs. I didn't use guppy since it required a C extension and I didn't have root so it was going to be a pain to build. None of the objects I was using have a __del__ method, and looking through the libraries, it doesn't look like Django or the python-mysqldb do either. What should I do now to debug the memory problems?"

        "content": "Debugging memory leaks in a Django application, especially when involving multithreading, can be challenging. Here are some steps and techniques you can try to identify and resolve the memory leak issue:\n\n1. **Review Thread Usage**: Ensure that your threads are properly managed and terminated. Threads that are not properly joined or terminated can cause memory issues. Make sure to use threading best practices, such as using `ThreadPoolExecutor` from the `concurrent.futures` module for managing threads more efficiently.\n\n2. **Optimize Database Queries**: Check if there are any unoptimized database queries that might be pulling large amounts of data into memory. Using Django's `select_related` and `prefetch_related` can help optimize query performance and memory usage.\n\n3. **Connection Management**: Ensure that database connections are properly managed and closed. Unclosed connections can lead to memory leaks. Use Django's `connection.close()` or `django.db.close_old_connections()` to manage connections effectively.\n\n4. **Use Memory Profiling Tools**: While `pympler` is a good start, consider using other memory profiling tools that can offer deeper insights:\n   - **objgraph**: This can help you identify the objects that are growing in memory.\n   - **tracemalloc**: This built-in module can help trace memory allocations over time.\n   - **memory_profiler**: It provides line-by-line memory usage statistics.\n\n5. **Check for Reference Cycles**: Use the `gc` module's `gc.collect()` and `gc.get_objects()` to check for reference cycles. Reference cycles can prevent garbage collection from freeing up memory.\n\n6. **Analyze Third-Party Libraries**: If you're using third-party libraries, ensure they are up-to-date. Sometimes, memory leaks can originate from these libraries.\n\n7. **Inspect Long-Lived Objects**: Use `tracemalloc` to identify objects that have unusually long lifetimes. This can help you pinpoint objects that are being retained unexpectedly.\n\n8. **Limit In-Memory Data**: For any data structures (like lists, sets, etc.), ensure they are not growing indefinitely. Consider using more memory-efficient data structures or databases for large datasets.\n\n9. **Isolate Components**: Try to isolate parts of your application to see if the memory leak is tied to a specific component or functionality. You can comment out parts of the code to narrow down the source of the leak.\n\n10. **Consider Python Environment**: If possible, running your application in a different environment (like a virtual machine with root access) might allow you to use C extensions and tools like `guppy`.\n\nBy systematically analyzing each component and using profiling tools, you can identify the memory leak source and implement a fix. It can be a time-consuming process, but thorough investigation is key to solving such issues."
