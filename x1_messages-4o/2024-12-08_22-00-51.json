        "content": "Prairie ecosystems host a diverse array of bird species, each with unique migratory behaviors, nesting preferences, and feeding habits. Here's a detailed overview:\n\n### Types of Prairie Birds:\n\n1. **Migratory Birds:**\n   - **Western Meadowlark**: Known for their distinctive song, they migrate to southern regions during winter.\n   - **Upland Sandpiper**: Migrates to South America for winter, prefers open grasslands for nesting.\n\n2. **Resident Birds:**\n   - **Greater Prairie-Chicken**: Non-migratory, relies on grasslands year-round.\n   - **Ring-necked Pheasant**: Introduced species, often remains within its habitat throughout the year.\n\n3. **Nesting Preferences:**\n   - **Ground Nesters**: Birds like the Killdeer and Horned Lark prefer open ground for nesting.\n   - **Shrub Nesters**: Species such as the Grasshopper Sparrow opt for low shrubs or tall grasses.\n\n4. **Feeding Habits:**\n   - **Insectivores**: Species like the Eastern Kingbird primarily feed on insects.\n   - **Granivores**: Birds such as the Bobolink feed on seeds and grains.\n\n### Table of Prairie Birds:\n\n| Species                 | Geographic Range          | Physical Characteristics                       | Conservation Status |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Western Meadowlark      | North America             | Bright yellow underparts, black V on chest     | Least Concern       |\n| Upland Sandpiper        | North America to S. America| Long legs, slender body, small head           | Near Threatened     |\n| Greater Prairie-Chicken | Central US                | Barred brown and white plumage, round body     | Vulnerable          |\n| Ring-necked Pheasant    | Introduced in N. America  | Bright plumage with iridescent neck            | Least Concern       |\n| Killdeer                | Americas                  | Brown wings, white belly, double black chest bands | Least Concern   |\n| Horned Lark             | Worldwide                 | Brown and white plumage, small black \"horns\"   | Least Concern       |\n| Grasshopper Sparrow     | North and Central America | Brown-streaked, small size, flat head          | Vulnerable          |\n| Eastern Kingbird        | North and South America   | Black and white plumage, broad tail            | Least Concern       |\n| Bobolink                | North America to S. America| Black and white with buff nape                | Vulnerable          |\n\n### Machine Learning for Bird Classification:\n\nTo classify bird species based on visual and auditory features, you can use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for images and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for audio processing. Here's a simplified code snippet using TensorFlow and Keras:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout, LSTM\n\n# CNN for image classification\ndef build_image_model(input_shape):\n    model = Sequential([\n        Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),\n        MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\n        Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\n        MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\n        Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\n        MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\n        Flatten(),\n        Dense(128, activation='relu'),\n        Dropout(0.5),\n        Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')\n    ])\n    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])\n    return model\n\n# RNN for audio classification\ndef build_audio_model(input_shape):\n    model = Sequential([\n        LSTM(128, input_shape=input_shape, return_sequences=True),\n        LSTM(64),\n        Dense(64, activation='relu'),\n        Dropout(0.5),\n        Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')\n    ])\n    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])\n    return model\n\n# Example usage\nimage_input_shape = (128, 128, 3)  # Example input shape for images\naudio_input_shape = (100, 13)      # Example input shape for audio features (e.g., MFCC)\n\nnum_classes = 10  # Number of bird species to classify\n\nimage_model = build_image_model(image_input_shape)\naudio_model = build_audio_model(audio_input_shape)\n\n# Train and evaluate the models with your dataset\n# Use image_model.fit(...) and audio_model.fit(...) with your data\n```\n\nThis code provides a basic framework for building models that can classify bird species based on their visual and auditory features. You'll need to train these models with a labeled dataset of bird images and audio recordings to achieve accurate results."
