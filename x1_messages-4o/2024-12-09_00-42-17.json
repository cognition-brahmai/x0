        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the use of backslashes (`\\`) in the file path, which are interpreted as escape characters in Python string literals. In your specific case, `\\U` is being interpreted as the start of a Unicode escape sequence.\n\nThere are several ways to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Use Raw Strings**: Prefix the string with an `r` to make it a raw string, which tells Python to treat backslashes as literal characters and not as escape characters.\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   os.chdir(r'C:\\Users\\expoperialed\\Desktop\\Python')\n   ```\n\n2. **Use Double Backslashes**: Escape each backslash by doubling it. This is often used in Windows paths.\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   os.chdir('C:\\\\Users\\\\expoperialed\\\\Desktop\\\\Python')\n   ```\n\n3. **Use Forward Slashes**: Python can interpret forward slashes in file paths on Windows.\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   os.chdir('C:/Users/expoperialed/Desktop/Python')\n   ```\n\nAny of these methods should resolve the `SyntaxError` you're encountering. Choose the one that you find most convenient or readable for your code."
