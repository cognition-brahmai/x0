The algorithm should be able to handle negative prime numbers as well. The list can be generated randomly using a prime number generator function. The solution should not exceed a certain amount of memory and processing power, and should be able to output the sum of all the prime numbers in the list."

        "content": "To create an algorithm that efficiently handles a list of 10,000 prime numbers, including the ability to handle negative primes, and outputs the sum of these numbers, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Prime Number Generator\nFirst, we need a function to generate prime numbers. We'll use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate positive prime numbers efficiently.\n\n### Step 2: Generate Negative Primes\nTo handle negative prime numbers, simply negate the positive primes generated.\n\n### Step 3: Create the List\nCombine both positive and negative primes into a single list. Ensure that the list contains exactly 10,000 elements. This might involve balancing the count between positive and negative primes.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Sum\nIterate over the list and calculate the sum of all the integers.\n\n### Implementation\n\n```python\ndef sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit):\n    \"\"\"Generate prime numbers up to a given limit using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.\"\"\"\n    is_prime = [True] * (limit + 1)\n    p = 2\n    while (p * p <= limit):\n        if is_prime[p]:\n            for i in range(p * p, limit + 1, p):\n                is_prime[i] = False\n        p += 1\n    primes = [p for p in range(2, limit) if is_prime[p]]\n    return primes\n\ndef generate_prime_list(size):\n    \"\"\"Generate a list of prime numbers including both positive and negative primes.\"\"\"\n    # Generate a sufficient number of positive primes\n    primes = sieve_of_eratosthenes(104729)  # 10,000th prime is 104729\n    \n    # Check if we have enough primes\n    if len(primes) < size:\n        raise ValueError(\"Increase the sieve limit to generate enough primes.\")\n\n    # Select random primes and their negatives to form the list\n    selected_primes = primes[:size//2]\n    negative_primes = [-p for p in selected_primes]\n    \n    prime_list = selected_primes + negative_primes\n    # Shuffle to ensure randomness\n    import random\n    random.shuffle(prime_list)\n    \n    return prime_list[:size]\n\ndef sum_of_primes(prime_list):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the sum of the list of prime numbers.\"\"\"\n    return sum(prime_list)\n\n# Generate the list of 10,000 primes\nprime_list = generate_prime_list(10000)\n\n# Calculate the sum\ntotal_sum = sum_of_primes(prime_list)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(\"The sum of the prime numbers in the list is:\", total_sum)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: This is used to find all prime numbers up to a certain number efficiently.\n- **Negative Primes**: By negating positive primes, we generate negative counterparts.\n- **List Formation**: We ensure randomness by shuffling and maintaining a total of 10,000 primes.\n- **Sum Calculation**: Finally, we sum the list and print the result.\n\nThis algorithm efficiently manages memory and processing power by leveraging the Sieve of Eratosthenes and simple list operations."
