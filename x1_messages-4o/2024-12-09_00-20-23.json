        "content": "To create an object in Python that holds a specific date and time, you can use the `datetime` module which provides a class named `datetime` for handling dates and times. Here's how you can proceed with your class to include a specific date and time:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nclass Some:\n    def __init__(self, date_str):\n        self.date = datetime.strptime(date_str, '%d/%m/%y %H:%M')\n\n# Example usage\nsome_object = Some('05/10/09 18:00')\nprint(some_object.date)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- Import the `datetime` class from the `datetime` module.\n- Define a class `Some` with an `__init__` method that takes a `date_str` parameter.\n- Use `datetime.strptime()` to parse the string date and time into a `datetime` object. The format `'%d/%m/%y %H:%M'` specifies how to interpret the input string:\n  - `%d` is for the day of the month.\n  - `%m` is for the month.\n  - `%y` is for the year without century.\n  - `%H` is for the hour (24-hour clock).\n  - `%M` is for the minute.\n\nThis way, your class `Some` can instantiate objects that hold a specific date and time."
