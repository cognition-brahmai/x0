I create a data loader object using the following code:\n\n```python\ntrainset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True,\n                                        download=True, transform=transform)\ntrainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=4,\n                                          shuffle=True, num_workers=2)\n```\n\nI want to train the network on all images in odd positions, then on all images in even positions and so on. However, when I try to access those images using `trainset[:1000]` or `trainset[mask]`, it throws an error. I tried to fix it by using:\n\n```python\ntrainset.train_data=trainset.train_data[mask]\ntrainset.train_labels=trainset.train_labels[mask]\n```\nand then\n\n```python\ntrainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=4,\n                                          shuffle=True, num_workers=2)\n```\n\nBut this forces me to create a new copy of the full dataset in each iteration. Is there a way to avoid this? Ideally, I would like to have something \"equivalent\" to:\n\n```python\ntrainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset[mask], batch_size=4,\n                                          shuffle=True, num_workers=2)\n```"

        "content": "To achieve training on images in odd and even positions without creating new copies of the dataset each time, you can utilize a custom `Subset` or `SubsetRandomSampler` with the `DataLoader`. This approach allows you to specify indices for the data loader to sample from, avoiding the need to manipulate the dataset itself directly.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Create a list of indices for odd and even positions.**\n\n2. **Use these indices with a `SubsetRandomSampler` to create your `DataLoader`.**\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to implementing this:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torchvision\nimport torchvision.transforms as transforms\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader, SubsetRandomSampler\n\n# Define your transform\ntransform = transforms.Compose([\n    transforms.ToTensor(),\n    # Add other transforms as needed\n])\n\n# Load the full dataset\ntrainset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True,\n                                        download=True, transform=transform)\n\n# Create indices for odd and even positions\ntotal_indices = list(range(len(trainset)))\nodd_indices = total_indices[1::2]  # Start from index 1 (second element), step by 2\neven_indices = total_indices[0::2] # Start from index 0 (first element), step by 2\n\n# Create DataLoaders for odd and even indices using SubsetRandomSampler\nodd_sampler = SubsetRandomSampler(odd_indices)\neven_sampler = SubsetRandomSampler(even_indices)\n\nodd_loader = DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=4, sampler=odd_sampler, num_workers=2)\neven_loader = DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=4, sampler=even_sampler, num_workers=2)\n\n# You can now iterate over these loaders\n# Example: Training loop for odd indices\nfor images, labels in odd_loader:\n    # Training code here\n    pass\n\n# Example: Training loop for even indices\nfor images, labels in even_loader:\n    # Training code here\n    pass\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **SubsetRandomSampler**: This allows you to specify which indices to sample from in your dataset, without altering the dataset itself.\n- **Indices**: We generate indices for odd and even positions separately. This is efficient because it avoids the need to create new dataset copies.\n- **DataLoader with Sampler**: By passing the `SubsetRandomSampler` to the `DataLoader`, you only load the specified subset of images.\n\nThis approach is memory-efficient and adheres to the requirements of modifying the dataset access without duplicating data."
