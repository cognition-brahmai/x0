When I open a Python file that has clear errors, such as using undeclared variables or calling non-existing functions, PyCharm shows red stripes in the gutter of the file. However, I only discover these errors as I navigate to the file containing them. I am wondering if PyCharm has a feature similar to Visual Studio's \"Errors\" view, which lists all errors with file names and line numbers in a separate window and allows direct navigation to the source by clicking on these errors. Can PyCharm list all Python errors in a project like this?"

        "content": "Yes, PyCharm has a feature that allows you to view all the errors and warnings in your project in a centralized way, similar to Visual Studio's \"Errors\" view. Here's how you can use this feature:\n\n1. **Code Inspection**: PyCharm has a built-in code inspection feature that you can use to find errors and warnings across your entire project. To run a code inspection:\n   - Go to the top menu and select **Code** > **Inspect Code**.\n   - Choose the scope of the inspection (e.g., Whole Project) and click **OK**.\n   - PyCharm will analyze your code and present the results in a tool window.\n\n2. **Problems Tool Window**: After running the code inspection, PyCharm will open the **Problems** tool window. This window lists all the issues found in your project, including errors, warnings, and suggestions, along with file names and line numbers.\n   - You can navigate directly to the source of an error by double-clicking on the item in the list.\n\n3. **Project-Wide Analysis**: You can also enable project-wide analysis by going to **File** > **Settings** (or **PyCharm** > **Preferences** on macOS), navigating to **Editor** > **Inspections**, and configuring the inspections you want to be active. This ensures that PyCharm continuously analyzes your project and shows issues in the **Problems** tool window.\n\nBy utilizing these features, you can effectively manage and navigate through errors in your project without having to manually open each file."
