This task requires you to use a combination of if-else statements to categorize each object into one of the five predefined groups, namely \"Group A\", \"Group B\", \"Group C\", \"Group D\", and \"Group E\". Your code should output the categorization for each object in the list. To make this task more challenging, please ensure that the categorization is based on a multi-step reasoning process that takes into account both color and shape attributes of each object. Here is the list of objects: \nobjects = [('Red', 'Circle'), ('Blue', 'Square'), ('Green', 'Triangle'), ('Yellow', 'Star'), ('Orange', 'Diamond')]"

The categorization is printed at the end for each object in the list. The criteria for grouping are defined within the nested conditions, which can be adjusted based on any specific requirements or additional complexity desired."
