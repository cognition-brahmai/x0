The food chain starts with Phytoplankton being eaten by Zooplankton, then Zooplankton being eaten by Small Fish, and Small Fish being eaten by Squid. To determine the top predator, we need to query the table for the highest level predator. Which SQL query should we use to find the top predator in this food chain?"

This can be done using a query that selects predators from the table that do not appear in the prey column. Here's an SQL query to accomplish that:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Predator\nFROM FoodChain\nWHERE Predator NOT IN (SELECT Prey FROM FoodChain);\n```\n\nThis query works by selecting all predators that do not appear in the subquery's result, which lists all the prey. The result will be the top predator(s) in the food chain."
