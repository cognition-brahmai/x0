        "content": "To append content to a file without overwriting its existing content, you can open the file in append mode. In most programming languages, this is achieved by specifying an appropriate mode when opening the file. Here's how you can do it in a few different programming languages:\n\n### Python\n\n```python\nwith open('file.txt', 'a') as file:\n    file.write('Appended content\\n')\n```\n\nIn this example, `'a'` is the mode used to open the file for appending. The content will be added to the end of the file.\n\n### Java\n\n```java\nimport java.io.FileWriter;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class AppendToFile {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try (FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(\"file.txt\", true)) {\n            fw.write(\"Appended content\\n\");\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn Java, the `FileWriter` constructor takes a second parameter, which is a boolean indicating whether to append (`true`) or overwrite (`false`).\n\n### C#\n\n```csharp\nusing System.IO;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        using (StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter(\"file.txt\", true))\n        {\n            sw.WriteLine(\"Appended content\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSimilarly, in C#, the `StreamWriter` constructor takes a boolean parameter to specify appending.\n\n### JavaScript (Node.js)\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\nfs.appendFile('file.txt', 'Appended content\\n', (err) => {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    console.log('The content was appended!');\n});\n```\n\nNode.js provides an `appendFile` method in the `fs` module for this purpose.\n\nThese are just a few examples. Most programming languages provide a way to open a file in append mode, ensuring that new content is added to the end of the file without removing or altering the existing data."
