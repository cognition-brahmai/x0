The goal is to format the array in a way that makes the file easy to read. I've tried using the numpy.savetxt function, but it's giving me a \"TypeError: float argument required, not numpy.ndarray\" error. Is there a way to use this function with multidimensional arrays, or is there another solution that would allow me to write the array to a single file?"

        "content": "The `numpy.savetxt` function is designed for 1D or 2D arrays, which is why you're encountering a `TypeError` when trying to use it with a 3D array. To write a 3D array to a text file in a readable format, you can use a combination of loops and the `numpy.savetxt` function. Here's one way to do it:\n\n1. Loop through the first dimension of the array.\n2. For each 2D slice (i.e., a 2D array), use `numpy.savetxt` to write it to the file.\n3. Optionally, add a separator between slices to make the file more readable.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create a 4x11x14 numpy array\narray = np.random.rand(4, 11, 14)\n\n# Open a file to write the array\nwith open('array_output.txt', 'w') as f:\n    for i in range(array.shape[0]):\n        # Write a header for each 2D slice\n        f.write(f'Slice {i+1}\\n')\n        # Use numpy.savetxt to write each 2D slice\n        np.savetxt(f, array[i], fmt='%.6f')\n        # Write a newline to separate slices\n        f.write('\\n')\n\nprint(\"The array has been written to 'array_output.txt'.\")\n```\n\nThis script will create a file named `array_output.txt` where each 2D slice of the 3D array is written sequentially, with a header indicating the slice number and a newline separating each slice. You can adjust the format `fmt='%.6f'` to control the precision of the floating-point numbers in the output file."
