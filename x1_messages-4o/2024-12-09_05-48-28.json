When I try to pipe the output of a Python program, the Python interpreter gets confused about encoding and sets it to None. I noticed this issue when a program like the one below,\n\n```python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\nprint u\"\u00e5\u00e4\u00f6\"\n```\n\nworks fine when run normally, but fails with this error when used in a pipe sequence:\n\n```\nUnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\\xa0' in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)\n```\n\nI am looking for the best way to make this work when piping. Ideally, I want to tell it to use whatever encoding the shell/filesystem/whatever is using. The suggestions I have seen include modifying the site.py directly or hardcoding the defaultencoding with the below hack:\n\n```python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\nimport sys\nreload(sys)\nsys.setdefaultencoding('utf-8')\nprint u\"\u00e5\u00e4\u00f6\"\n```\n\nIs there a better way to make piping work?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is quite common when dealing with Unicode in Python 2, especially when piping output to another program or file, which can sometimes cause Python to default to ASCII encoding. Here are some better practices to handle this situation:\n\n1. **Use Python 3**: The most straightforward solution is to switch to Python 3, which has much better Unicode support and handles text encoding more intuitively. In Python 3, strings are Unicode by default, and you can specify the encoding of standard output when needed. For example:\n\n    ```python\n    # Python 3 code\n    print(\"\u00e5\u00e4\u00f6\")\n    ```\n\n2. **Explicit Encoding in Python 2**: If you must stick with Python 2, you can explicitly encode your Unicode strings before printing them. This ensures that the encoding process doesn't rely on the default encoding:\n\n    ```python\n    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n    import sys\n\n    # Define your desired encoding\n    encoding = sys.stdout.encoding or 'utf-8'\n\n    # Encode the Unicode string\n    print u\"\u00e5\u00e4\u00f6\".encode(encoding)\n    ```\n\n3. **Using `io` module**: You can also use the `io` module to set the encoding for standard output:\n\n    ```python\n    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n    import sys\n    import io\n\n    # Set the desired encoding\n    sys.stdout = io.TextIOWrapper(sys.stdout, encoding='utf-8', line_buffering=True)\n\n    # Now print the Unicode string\n    print u\"\u00e5\u00e4\u00f6\"\n    ```\n\n4. **Environment Variables**: Ensure your environment is set up correctly. If you're on a Unix-like system, check your locale settings with `locale` command. Your `LANG` or `LC_*` environment variables should be set to a UTF-8 locale (e.g., `en_US.UTF-8`).\n\n5. **Workaround with `PYTHONIOENCODING`**: You can set the `PYTHONIOENCODING` environment variable to `utf-8` before running your script. This will force Python to use UTF-8 for standard input/output:\n\n    ```bash\n    PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python your_script.py | other_command\n    ```\n\nUsing these methods should help you handle Unicode output correctly when piping in Python 2. However, if possible, transitioning to Python 3 is recommended for better Unicode support and future-proofing your code."
