        "content": "Yes, there are several simple methods to verify PEP8 compliance in an iPython notebook. Here are a few options:\n\n1. **Flake8 Magic Command**: You can use the `flake8` magic command to check your code within the notebook. First, you need to install `flake8` and `flake8-magic`:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install flake8 flake8-magic\n   ```\n\n   Then, load the `flake8` magic extension in your notebook:\n\n   ```python\n   %load_ext flake8_magic\n   ```\n\n   After loading the extension, you can use the `%%flake8` cell magic to check a specific cell for PEP8 compliance:\n\n   ```python\n   %%flake8\n   def example_function():\n       print(\"Hello, World!\")\n   ```\n\n2. **autopep8**: This tool automatically formats Python code to conform to the PEP8 style guide. You can install it via:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install autopep8\n   ```\n\n   You can use `autopep8` to format your code in the command line or integrate it into your editor. However, within a Jupyter notebook, you might need to run it separately on your script files.\n\n3. **nbQA**: This tool allows you to run static analysis tools like `flake8` on Jupyter Notebooks. Install it with:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install nbqa\n   ```\n\n   Then run it on your notebook:\n\n   ```bash\n   nbqa flake8 your_notebook.ipynb\n   ```\n\n4. **Jupyter Notebook Extensions**: There are several extensions for Jupyter that can help with code quality checks. One popular extension is `jupyter_contrib_nbextensions`, which includes a variety of tools. Install it with:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions\n   jupyter contrib nbextension install --user\n   ```\n\n   After installation, you can enable extensions through the Jupyter Notebook interface, although specific PEP8 checkers might not be available directly.\n\nBy using these methods, you can ensure that your code adheres to PEP8 standards while working within an iPython notebook."
