        "content": "Yes, you can make HTTP PUT requests in Python, and while `urllib2` (which is available in Python 2) primarily focuses on HTTP GET and POST, you can use other libraries that support HTTP PUT, such as `requests`. The `requests` library is a powerful and user-friendly HTTP library for Python that makes it easy to send HTTP/1.1 requests, including PUT.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can use the `requests` library to perform an HTTP PUT request:\n\n1. First, ensure that you have the `requests` library installed. You can install it using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\n2. Use the following code snippet to perform a PUT request:\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n\n   # Define the URL where you want to upload data\n   url = 'http://example.com/api/upload'\n\n   # Define the data you want to upload\n   data = {\n       'key1': 'value1',\n       'key2': 'value2'\n   }\n\n   # Perform the PUT request\n   response = requests.put(url, json=data)\n\n   # Check the response from the server\n   if response.status_code == 200:\n       print('Data uploaded successfully!')\n   else:\n       print(f'Failed to upload data. Status code: {response.status_code}')\n       print('Response:', response.text)\n   ```\n\nIn this example, the `requests.put()` method is used to send a PUT request to the specified URL, with data sent as a JSON payload. You can also send other types of data, such as files or form-encoded data, by adjusting the parameters accordingly.\n\nThe `requests` library automatically handles many aspects of HTTP requests, like headers and authentication, making it a convenient choice for working with HTTP in Python."
