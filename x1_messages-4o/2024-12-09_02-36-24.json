I have found a basic comparison of speeds in a blog post and a GitHub discussion that claims that files created with `fastparquet` do not support AWS-athena. I'm not sure if this is still the case. When and why would I use one over the other? What are the major advantages and disadvantages of each? My specific use case is processing data with `dask`, writing it to s3, and then reading/analyzing it with AWS-athena."

        "content": "When deciding between `fastparquet` and `pyarrow` for your use case, several factors come into play, including compatibility, performance, and feature support. Here's a detailed comparison to help you make an informed decision:\n\n### Fastparquet\n\n**Advantages:**\n1. **Lightweight**: `fastparquet` is a smaller library with fewer dependencies, which can be advantageous if you prefer a lighter installation.\n2. **Integration with Dask**: It is well-integrated with Dask, making it efficient for parallel processing tasks.\n3. **Custom Compression**: Allows more fine-grained control over compression settings.\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n1. **AWS Athena Compatibility**: Historically, there have been issues with AWS Athena reading files written by `fastparquet`. This is because `fastparquet` might not handle some Parquet format nuances that Athena expects. Always test with the latest version, as these issues could be resolved.\n2. **Performance Variability**: In some cases, `fastparquet` might not be as optimized as `pyarrow`, especially for certain complex read/write operations.\n\n### Pyarrow\n\n**Advantages:**\n1. **AWS Athena Compatibility**: `pyarrow` generally has better compatibility with AWS Athena, as it tends to adhere more closely to the Parquet format specifications that Athena expects.\n2. **Performance**: Often faster for both reading and writing Parquet files, especially with larger datasets or more complex operations.\n3. **Feature Rich**: Supports a wider range of features, such as advanced compression techniques, and integration with the Arrow memory format for efficient in-memory operations.\n4. **Community and Support**: Being part of the Apache Arrow project, it has a strong community and is actively maintained.\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n1. **Larger Installation**: `pyarrow` has more dependencies and can be a heavier installation compared to `fastparquet`.\n2. **Complexity**: With more features, it might be more complex to configure for specific use cases.\n\n### Use Case Considerations\n\nFor your specific use case of processing data with Dask, writing to S3, and analyzing with AWS Athena, `pyarrow` might be the better choice due to its compatibility with AWS Athena and potentially better performance. However, here are some considerations:\n\n- **Testing**: Always conduct tests with your specific data and infrastructure. AWS Athena's compatibility issues with `fastparquet` might not affect your specific use case, or they might have been resolved in recent updates.\n- **Performance Needs**: If you are handling very large datasets, `pyarrow` might offer performance advantages.\n- **Installation Constraints**: If you have constraints on the size or complexity of your software environment, `fastparquet` might be preferable.\n\nUltimately, the decision might also depend on specific features you need or existing infrastructure. Testing both libraries on your specific workflows can provide more insights into which one suits your needs better."
