        "content": "To design a SQL query that calculates the average price of an item sold within the last seven days, you'll need to consider the structure of your database and the names of the relevant tables and columns. Let's assume you have a table named `sales` with at least the following columns:\n\n- `sale_date`: The date the item was sold.\n- `price`: The price at which the item was sold.\n\nHere's an example query to calculate the average price of an item sold within the last seven days:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(price) AS average_price\nFROM sales\nWHERE sale_date >= CURDATE() - INTERVAL 7 DAY;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **SELECT AVG(price) AS average_price**: This part of the query calculates the average of the `price` column and assigns it the alias `average_price`.\n\n2. **FROM sales**: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data.\n\n3. **WHERE sale_date >= CURDATE() - INTERVAL 7 DAY**: This condition filters the records to include only those where the `sale_date` is within the last seven days. `CURDATE()` returns the current date, and `INTERVAL 7 DAY` is used to subtract seven days from it.\n\nMake sure to replace `sales`, `sale_date`, and `price` with the actual table and column names from your database schema if they are different."
