Then, you can call the GetElevationProfile method to get the elevation profile of a specific range of rows, and the GetHighestPeak method to get the highest peak in the entire map. Finally, you can output the results in the desired format (e.g., HTML)."

        "content": "To generate a topographic profile of the Rocky Mountains using an elevation map in HTML format, you'll need to follow a few steps to process your data and visualize it effectively. Here\u2019s a guide on how to achieve this:\n\n1. **Extract Elevation Data:**\n   - Begin by parsing the HTML elevation map to extract the elevation data into a 2D array. This could involve reading HTML tables or any embedded data format.\n\n2. **Use the Provided C# Code:**\n   - Utilize the `ElevationMap` class you have to process the extracted elevation data. This class will help you get the topographic profile and identify the highest peaks.\n\n3. **Implementing the Code:**\n   - Initialize your elevation data as a 2D array. For example, if you've parsed your HTML and have elevation data ready:\n     ```csharp\n     int[,] elevationData = new int[,] {\n         { 1500, 1600, 1700, ... },\n         { 1400, 1550, 1650, ... },\n         // Add more rows with elevation data\n     };\n     ```\n\n   - Create an instance of the `ElevationMap` class and use its methods:\n     ```csharp\n     ElevationMap map = new ElevationMap(elevationData);\n     List<int> profile = map.GetElevationProfile(0, elevationData.GetLength(0) - 1);\n     int highestPeak = map.GetHighestPeak();\n     ```\n\n4. **Output the Results:**\n   - To display the results in HTML, you need to convert the data into a suitable format for rendering. You can use HTML with embedded JavaScript or a framework like ASP.NET Core MVC or Razor Pages to dynamically generate the HTML.\n\n5. **Visualization:**\n   - For visualization, you might use libraries such as Chart.js or D3.js to create interactive profiles and highlight the highest peaks.\n   - Embed a script in your HTML to plot the data:\n     ```html\n     <canvas id=\"elevationChart\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></canvas>\n     <script>\n         var ctx = document.getElementById('elevationChart').getContext('2d');\n         var chart = new Chart(ctx, {\n             type: 'line',\n             data: {\n                 labels: [/* Your labels here, e.g., 'Point 1', 'Point 2', ... */],\n                 datasets: [{\n                     label: 'Elevation Profile',\n                     data: [/* Your profile data here */],\n                     borderColor: 'rgba(75, 192, 192, 1)',\n                     fill: false\n                 }]\n             },\n             options: {\n                 scales: {\n                     yAxes: [{\n                         ticks: {\n                             beginAtZero: true\n                         }\n                     }]\n                 }\n             }\n         });\n     </script>\n     ```\n\n6. **Highlight Highest Peaks:**\n   - You can highlight the highest peak in your visualization by adding a marker or a different color specifically for that data point.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to generate a topographic profile and identify the highest peaks of the Rocky Mountains from your HTML elevation map, and visualize these using interactive charts in a web page."
