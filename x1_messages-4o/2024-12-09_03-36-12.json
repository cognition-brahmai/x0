When I run the `predict_proba()` method, I receive an output array of probabilities. However, I'm unsure which probability corresponds to which class. The documentation states they are ordered by arithmetical order, but I'm unsure what that means. Is there a way to directly find out the corresponding class for each probability? Is there a command similar to `clf.getClasses()` that would return the classes in the order of ['one', 'two', 'three']?\n\nCode:\n\n```python\nclasses = ['one','two','three','one','three']\n\nfeature = [[0,1,1,0],[0,1,0,1],[1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1]]\n\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import BernoulliNB\n\nclf = BernoulliNB()\nclf.fit(feature,classes)\nclf.predict_proba([0,1,1,0])\n>> array([[ 0.48247836,  0.40709111,  0.11043053]])\n```"

        "content": "In scikit-learn, when you use classifiers like `BernoulliNB`, the class labels are sorted in lexicographical (alphabetical) order, and the probabilities returned by `predict_proba()` correspond to these ordered classes.\n\nHere's how you can find out the order in which the classes are stored in your classifier:\n\n```python\n# After fitting the model, you can access the classes using the `classes_` attribute:\nordered_classes = clf.classes_\nprint(ordered_classes)\n```\n\nFor your specific case, you can use this information to map the probabilities to their respective classes:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nclasses = ['one', 'two', 'three', 'one', 'three']\nfeature = [[0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1]]\n\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import BernoulliNB\n\nclf = BernoulliNB()\nclf.fit(feature, classes)\n\n# Get the ordered classes\nordered_classes = clf.classes_\nprint(\"Ordered classes:\", ordered_classes)\n\n# Predict probabilities\nprobabilities = clf.predict_proba([[0, 1, 1, 0]])\nprint(\"Probabilities:\", probabilities)\n\n# Map each probability to its respective class\nclass_probabilities = dict(zip(ordered_classes, probabilities[0]))\nprint(\"Class Probabilities:\", class_probabilities)\n```\n\nThis script will give you the ordered classes and their corresponding probabilities, allowing you to interpret the `predict_proba()` output correctly. In your example, you should see the output in the order of `['one', 'three', 'two']` based on the lexicographical sorting of the class labels."
