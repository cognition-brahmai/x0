        "content": "Creating a survey question in C++ to measure satisfaction with an online shopping experience involves defining variables for different aspects of the shopping experience, collecting responses, and using conditional statements to tailor the survey based on previous responses. Below is a simple example of how you might implement this:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n\nint main() {\n    std::string easeOfUse, productSelection, customerService;\n    int overallSatisfaction;\n\n    std::cout << \"Please rate the following aspects of your online shopping experience on a scale of 1 to 5:\\n\";\n\n    std::cout << \"Ease of use (1: Very Difficult, 5: Very Easy): \";\n    std::getline(std::cin, easeOfUse);\n\n    std::cout << \"Product selection (1: Very Poor, 5: Excellent): \";\n    std::getline(std::cin, productSelection);\n\n    std::cout << \"Customer service (1: Very Poor, 5: Excellent): \";\n    std::getline(std::cin, customerService);\n\n    // Calculate an average satisfaction score for simplicity\n    overallSatisfaction = (std::stoi(easeOfUse) + std::stoi(productSelection) + std::stoi(customerService)) / 3;\n\n    std::cout << \"\\nBased on your ratings, your overall satisfaction is: \" << overallSatisfaction << \"/5\\n\";\n\n    // Use conditional statements to tailor the next question\n    if (overallSatisfaction < 3) {\n        std::cout << \"We're sorry to hear that your experience was not satisfactory. Could you please let us know how we can improve? \";\n    } else {\n        std::cout << \"Thank you for your positive feedback! Is there anything we can do to make your experience even better? \";\n    }\n\n    std::string feedback;\n    std::getline(std::cin, feedback);\n\n    std::cout << \"Thank you for your feedback!\\n\";\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Variables**: \n   - `easeOfUse`, `productSelection`, `customerService`: These strings store the user's ratings for different aspects of the shopping experience.\n   - `overallSatisfaction`: An integer calculated as the average of the ratings, providing a simple overall satisfaction score.\n\n2. **Input**: \n   - The user is prompted to rate each aspect on a scale from 1 to 5.\n\n3. **Conditional Statements**:\n   - The average satisfaction score is used to determine the follow-up question. If the score is less than 3, the user is asked how the experience can be improved. If the score is 3 or higher, the user is thanked and asked for additional suggestions.\n\nThis simple program can be expanded with more sophisticated logic, validation for user inputs, and additional questions to create a more comprehensive survey."
