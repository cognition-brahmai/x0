        "content": "Certainly! To generate a report listing all users and their total purchases for a specific month, you can use the following SQL query. This assumes you have a table named `purchases` with columns such as `user_id`, `purchase_amount`, and `purchase_date`, and a `users` table with columns like `user_id` and `user_name`.\n\nHere's an example SQL statement:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    u.user_id,\n    u.user_name,\n    SUM(p.purchase_amount) AS total_purchases\nFROM \n    users u\nJOIN \n    purchases p ON u.user_id = p.user_id\nWHERE \n    MONTH(p.purchase_date) = ? AND YEAR(p.purchase_date) = ?\nGROUP BY \n    u.user_id, u.user_name\nORDER BY \n    total_purchases DESC;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`JOIN`**: Combines data from the `users` and `purchases` tables based on the `user_id`.\n- **`WHERE`**: Filters purchases to include only those made in the specified month and year. You would replace the `?` placeholders with the desired month and year values.\n- **`SUM(p.purchase_amount)`**: Calculates the total purchases for each user.\n- **`GROUP BY`**: Groups the results by `user_id` and `user_name`.\n- **`ORDER BY total_purchases DESC`**: Sorts the results by total purchases in descending order.\n\nMake sure to replace the table and column names if they are different in your database schema. Additionally, adapt the date filtering logic if your database system uses a different function for extracting the month and year from a date."
