You want to use a conflict resolution strategy to resolve the issue. Which strategy would be appropriate to use in this situation? \nTo give you more context, here is an Excel table outlining some common conflict resolution strategies and their characteristics:\n| Strategy | Description | When to use |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Accommodation | One party gives in to the other's demands | When the issue is minor or when preserving the relationship is more important |\n| Competition | Both parties try to win the argument | When a quick decision is needed or when one party is clearly right |\n| Collaboration | Both parties work together to find a mutually beneficial solution | When both parties' concerns are important and time is available |\n| Compromise | Both parties give up something to reach a middle ground | When both parties' concerns are equally important and time is limited |\n| Avoidance | Both parties avoid the issue altogether | When the issue is minor or when the relationship is not important |\nBased on this table, which conflict resolution strategy would be most appropriate for the situation where two colleagues disagree on the design of a presentation?"

This strategy is suitable because both parties' concerns are important, and it allows you to work together to find a mutually beneficial solution. If time permits, collaboration can lead to a more creative and effective presentation design by integrating the best ideas from both parties. It also helps in maintaining a positive working relationship, fostering teamwork, and ensuring that both parties feel valued and heard."
