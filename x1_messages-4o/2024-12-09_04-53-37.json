I have a list with duplicate elements as shown:\n\n```python\nlist_a=[1,2,3,5,6,7,5,2]\ntmp=[]\nfor i in list_a:\n    if tmp.__contains__(i):\n        print i\n    else:\n        tmp.append(i)\n```\n\nI have used the above code snippet to find the duplicates in the list_a. However, I do not wish to remove the elements from the list. In C/C++, I believe we usually use a nested for loop structure like this to achieve the same:\n\n```c\nfor (int i=0;i<=list_a.length;i++)\n    for (int j=i+1;j<=list_a.length;j++)\n        if (list_a[i]==list_a[j])\n            print list_a[i]\n```\n\nI've tried to implement a similar structure in Python as follows:\n\n```python\nfor i in list_a:\n    for j in list_a[1:]:\n    #...\n```\n\nBut it seems to be returning wrong results. I am not sure how to increment the value for `j` in this case. How do I find duplicates in an array using for loop in Python?"

        "content": "To find duplicates in a list using a nested for loop structure in Python, you need to adjust the inner loop to ensure that it starts from the next element after the current element in the outer loop. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nlist_a = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 5, 2]\nduplicates = []\n\nfor i in range(len(list_a)):\n    for j in range(i + 1, len(list_a)):\n        if list_a[i] == list_a[j]:\n            if list_a[i] not in duplicates:  # To ensure each duplicate is only printed once\n                duplicates.append(list_a[i])\n\nprint(\"Duplicates:\", duplicates)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Outer Loop**: Iterates over each element in the list using the index `i`.\n2. **Inner Loop**: Starts from `i + 1` to ensure it compares the current element with only the elements that come after it, using the index `j`.\n3. **Comparison**: Checks if the elements at positions `i` and `j` are equal.\n4. **Duplicate Check**: Before appending the duplicate element to the `duplicates` list, it checks if the element is already in the list to avoid printing the same duplicate multiple times.\n\nThis approach is similar to the C/C++ nested loop method and should give you the correct duplicate elements in the list."
