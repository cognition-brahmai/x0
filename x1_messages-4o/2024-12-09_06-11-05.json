        "content": "In Keras, if you want to find out the number of layers in a model without manually counting them from the `model.summary()`, you can directly access the `model.layers` attribute. This attribute is a list of all the layers in the model, and you can simply take the length of this list to get the number of layers. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\n\n# Assume 'model' is your Keras model\nnum_layers = len(model.layers)\nprint(f'The model has {num_layers} layers.')\n```\n\nThis will give you a straightforward count of all the layers in your model. Note that this count includes all layers, such as input layers, dense layers, convolutional layers, etc. If you are using a Sequential model or a model created using the Functional API, this method will work the same way."
