        "content": "To write a scraper that downloads all image files from an HTML page, you can use Python with libraries like `requests` to fetch the web page, `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML and locate image tags, and `os` to handle file operations. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to accomplish this:\n\n1. **Install Necessary Libraries**: If you haven't already, install the `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` libraries using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests beautifulsoup4\n   ```\n\n2. **Write the Scraper Script**:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   import requests\n   from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n   from urllib.parse import urljoin\n\n   def download_images(url, folder_path):\n       # Create the folder if it doesn't exist\n       if not os.path.exists(folder_path):\n           os.makedirs(folder_path)\n\n       # Fetch the HTML content\n       response = requests.get(url)\n       soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')\n\n       # Find all image tags\n       img_tags = soup.find_all('img')\n\n       # Extract and download each image\n       for img in img_tags:\n           img_url = img.get('src')\n           # Handle relative URLs\n           img_url = urljoin(url, img_url)\n           try:\n               # Get the image content\n               img_response = requests.get(img_url)\n               img_response.raise_for_status()\n\n               # Get the image file name\n               img_name = os.path.join(folder_path, os.path.basename(img_url))\n\n               # Save the image\n               with open(img_name, 'wb') as f:\n                   f.write(img_response.content)\n\n               print(f\"Downloaded: {img_name}\")\n\n           except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n               print(f\"Failed to download {img_url}: {e}\")\n\n   # Example usage\n   download_images('https://example.com/page-with-images', './downloaded_images')\n   ```\n\n3. **Customize and Run the Script**:\n\n   - Replace `'https://example.com/page-with-images'` with the actual URL of the page you want to scrape.\n   - Change `'./downloaded_images'` to the desired directory path where you want to save the images.\n\n4. **Run the Script**: Execute the script in your Python environment to download the images.\n\nThis script will download all images linked in the `src` attribute of `img` tags on the specified page. It handles both absolute and relative URLs by using `urljoin`. Make sure to comply with the website's Terms of Service and `robots.txt` file, and consider implementing delays or throttling if scraping large numbers of images."
