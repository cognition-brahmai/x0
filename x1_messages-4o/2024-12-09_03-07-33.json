        "content": "To print the current call stack in Python, you can use the `traceback` module, which provides utilities for extracting, formatting, and printing stack traces of Python programs. Here is how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport traceback\n\ndef print_call_stack():\n    # Extract the current call stack\n    stack = traceback.format_stack()\n    \n    # Print each frame in the call stack\n    print(\"Current Call Stack:\")\n    for frame in stack:\n        print(frame.strip())\n\ndef some_function():\n    another_function()\n\ndef another_function():\n    # Print the call stack from within this function\n    print_call_stack()\n\n# Example usage\nsome_function()\n```\n\nIn this example, calling `some_function()` will trigger `another_function()`, which then prints the current call stack. The `traceback.format_stack()` function returns a list of strings, each representing a stack frame. We loop through this list and print each frame to get a readable output of the call stack.\n\nThis approach is useful for debugging purposes, as it allows you to see the series of function calls that led to a specific point in your code."
