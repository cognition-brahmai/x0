For instance, if the integer variable 'X' is 65 and the current date is '2014-06-03 15:45:00', I would like to get the result '2014-06-03 15:43:45'. I understand that I might be able to use the 'datetime' module, but I have not been successful in doing this so far."

        "content": "To subtract a certain number of seconds from a given date and time in Python, you can use the `datetime` module, which provides a convenient way to handle dates and times. Here's how you can do it in Python 3.3.3:\n\n1. Import the necessary classes from the `datetime` module.\n2. Create a `datetime` object representing the current date and time.\n3. Subtract a `timedelta` object, which represents the duration you want to subtract, from the `datetime` object.\n\nHere's a step-by-step example:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Define the current date and time\ncurrent_datetime = datetime(2014, 6, 3, 15, 45, 0)\n\n# Define the number of seconds to subtract\nX = 65\n\n# Create a timedelta object representing the duration to subtract\ntime_difference = timedelta(seconds=X)\n\n# Subtract the timedelta from the current date and time\nnew_datetime = current_datetime - time_difference\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"New date and time:\", new_datetime)\n```\n\nIn this example, `current_datetime` is initially set to `'2014-06-03 15:45:00'`. By subtracting `time_difference`, which is a `timedelta` object with 65 seconds, you get the result `'2014-06-03 15:43:55'`. The `print` statement will output this new date and time."
