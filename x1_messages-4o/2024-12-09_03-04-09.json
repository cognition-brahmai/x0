    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the `hashlib` module in Python 3.x expects byte-like objects, not strings (i.e., Unicode objects). Therefore, you need to encode the string before hashing it. You can do this by using the `encode()` method which converts a string into a bytes object. Here's how you can modify your code to resolve the `TypeError`:\n\n```python\nimport hashlib, sys\n\nm = hashlib.md5()\nhash = \"\"\nhash_file = input(\"What is the file name in which the hash resides?  \")\nwordlist = input(\"What is your wordlist?  (Enter the file name)  \")\n\ntry:\n    hashdocument = open(hash_file, \"r\")\nexcept IOError:\n    print(\"Invalid file.\")\n    input()\n    sys.exit()\nelse:\n    hash = hashdocument.readline().strip()\n\ntry:\n    wordlistfile = open(wordlist, \"r\")\nexcept IOError:\n    print(\"Invalid file.\")\n    input()\n    sys.exit()\nelse:\n    pass\n\nfor line in wordlistfile:\n    m = hashlib.md5()\n    line = line.strip()\n    m.update(line.encode('utf-8'))  # Encode the line before hashing\n    word_hash = m.hexdigest()\n    if word_hash == hash:\n        print(\"Collision! The word corresponding to the given hash is\", line)\n        input()\n        sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"The hash given does not correspond to any supplied word in the wordlist.\")\ninput()\nsys.exit()\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Encoding Strings**: `line.encode('utf-8')` is used to convert the string `line` into a bytes object before hashing.\n2. **Use `strip()`**: I replaced `line.replace(\"\\n\", \"\")` with `line.strip()` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace, including newlines.\n\nWith these changes, your code should run without encountering the `TypeError`."
