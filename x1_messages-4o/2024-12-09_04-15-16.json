        "content": "The error message you're encountering is likely due to an incompatibility between the versions of the libraries you're using. The `'io_loop'` argument has been deprecated or removed in more recent versions of some libraries, which can cause issues if other parts of your setup are outdated or incompatible. Here\u2019s how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Upgrade Tornado**: The `io_loop` argument issue is commonly associated with the Tornado library. Try upgrading Tornado to a more recent version. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade tornado\n   ```\n\n2. **Consider Upgrading Python**: Python 2.7 is no longer supported and many modern libraries may not fully support it anymore. If possible, consider upgrading to Python 3.x. Python 3.7 or later is recommended for better compatibility with newer libraries.\n\n3. **Upgrade Jupyter and Related Packages**: Make sure all your Jupyter-related packages are up to date. You can upgrade them using:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade jupyter notebook\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Compatibility Issues**: Ensure that all your installed packages are compatible with each other. You can use a tool like `pipdeptree` to check dependencies:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pipdeptree\n   pipdeptree\n   ```\n\n5. **Create a Virtual Environment**: To avoid conflicts and compatibility issues, consider creating a virtual environment. This isolates package installations from your system Python:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n   pip install jupyter\n   ```\n\n6. **Reinstall Jupyter**: If the above steps do not resolve the issue, try uninstalling and reinstalling Jupyter:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall jupyter jupyter_core jupyter_client\n   pip install jupyter\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error and get Jupyter notebooks working smoothly on your MacBook Pro."
