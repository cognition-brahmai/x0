        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the version of Python you are using. The `from __future__ import annotations` feature was introduced in Python 3.7 to enable postponed evaluation of type annotations, which allows you to use annotations as forward references and reduces the runtime cost of type hints.\n\nSince you're seeing this error, it's likely that you are using Python 3.5 or earlier, where this feature is not available. To resolve this issue, you will need to upgrade your Python version to at least 3.7. Here's how you can check your current Python version and upgrade if necessary:\n\n1. **Check Python Version**:\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   ```\n\n2. **Upgrade Python**:\n   - If you are on a Unix-based system, you can use a package manager like `apt`, `brew`, or `pyenv`.\n   - On Windows, you can download the latest Python installer from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/) and run it to upgrade.\n\nAfter upgrading to Python 3.7 or later, the `from __future__ import annotations` statement should work without any issues."
