Normally, when I run my application in development mode, the terminal prints out the message \"* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ * Restarting with reloader\". However, in this project, the second line of the message has changed to \"* Restarting with stat\". I am using the same starter-kit project that I have used many times before and this behavior did not occur. Furthermore, this project is consuming about 15% of the CPU steadily, which is significantly higher than my other projects. Can you help me understand why this is happening?"

        "content": "The message \"* Restarting with stat\" indicates that the Flask development server is using the `stat` module to detect changes in your files and automatically reload the application. This behavior is normal but seeing it instead of the typical reloader message might suggest a change in your project's configuration or environment.\n\nHere's what could cause this:\n\n1. **Change in Environment or Dependencies:**\n   - If you've updated Flask or any related dependencies recently, it's possible there's a change in how the reloader works.\n\n2. **Configuration Changes:**\n   - Check your Flask configuration settings. Ensure that there's nothing unusual or different concerning the development server settings.\n\n3. **File System Monitoring:**\n   - The `stat` reloader is used when the `watchdog` package, which provides more efficient file system monitoring, is not installed. You can try installing it using `pip install watchdog` to see if it changes the behavior.\n\n4. **High CPU Usage:**\n   - High CPU usage could be due to the application logic itself, which might have loops or processing tasks running in the background.\n   - Check for any inefficient code or logic that might be causing the CPU to spike.\n   - If `watchdog` isn't installed, `stat` can be more CPU-intensive as it checks files frequently. Installing `watchdog` might help reduce the CPU load.\n\n5. **Check for Recursive Operations:**\n   - Ensure there are no recursive operations in your code that might be executing repeatedly without termination.\n\n6. **External Libraries:**\n   - Evaluate any new libraries or extensions added to this project that might have different performance characteristics.\n\nBy investigating these areas, you should be able to pinpoint the cause of the change in the reloader behavior and the increased CPU usage. If all else fails, try creating a new virtual environment and reinstalling your dependencies to see if the issue persists."
