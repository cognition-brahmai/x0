I have a list that contains both numbers and letters in string format, for example, mylist=['1','orange','2','3','4','apple']. I want to create a new list that only contains the numbers, like mynewlist=['1','2','3','4']. Is there a way to check if each item in the list can be converted to an Integer and append it to the new list?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this by iterating through each item in the list and attempting to convert it to an integer. If the conversion is successful, it means that the item is a number in string format and can be added to the new list. You can use a try-except block to handle any exceptions that occur when trying to convert a non-numeric string to an integer. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nmylist = ['1', 'orange', '2', '3', '4', 'apple']\nmynewlist = []\n\nfor item in mylist:\n    try:\n        # Try to convert the item to an integer\n        int(item)\n        # If successful, append it to the new list\n        mynewlist.append(item)\n    except ValueError:\n        # If there's a ValueError, it means the item cannot be converted to an integer\n        continue\n\nprint(mynewlist)\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n```\n['1', '2', '3', '4']\n```\n\nThis way, only the items that can be successfully converted to integers are added to `mynewlist`."
