        "content": "To perform a select operation in SQLAlchemy that includes an alias for a column or a literal value, you can use the `label` method or the `literal` function. In your case, you want to include a literal string `'user'` as a new column with an alias. Here's how you can do it:\n\nFirst, ensure you have the necessary imports:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import select, literal\nfrom sqlalchemy.sql import table, column\n```\n\nAssuming `users_table` is your table object, here's how you can construct the query:\n\n```python\n# Assuming users_table is already defined as your table object\nquery = select([\n    users_table.c.username,\n    users_table.c.userid,\n    literal('user').label('new_column')\n])\n```\n\nIn this query:\n- `users_table.c.username` and `users_table.c.userid` are columns from your table.\n- `literal('user')` creates a SQL expression representing the string `'user'`.\n- `.label('new_column')` assigns the alias `new_column` to the literal value.\n\nThis query will produce an SQL statement similar to:\n\n```sql\nSELECT username, userid, 'user' AS new_column FROM users_table\n```\n\nThis method allows you to add static values or expressions with an alias as part of your query in SQLAlchemy."
