I understand that if a number divides by anything within this range, it is not a prime number, and that's why the function returns False. But, I am not sure about the role of taking the square root of the number. Why do we check up to the square root of the number in the loop?\n\nHere is the function for reference:\n```python\ndef isPrime(n):\n    for i in range(2,int(n**0.5)+1):\n        if n%i==0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```"

        "content": "The reason for checking divisibility only up to the square root of the number in your prime-checking function is based on the properties of divisors. Here's a more detailed explanation:\n\n1. **Understanding Divisors**: If a number \\( n \\) is not a prime, it can be factored into two factors, say \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), such that \\( n = a \\times b \\).\n\n2. **Properties of Factors**: If both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) were greater than the square root of \\( n \\), then their product \\( a \\times b \\) would be greater than \\( n \\), which is a contradiction. Therefore, at least one of the factors must be less than or equal to the square root of \\( n \\).\n\n3. **Efficiency**: By checking divisibility only up to the square root of \\( n \\), you significantly reduce the number of potential factors you need to check. This makes the algorithm more efficient, especially for larger numbers. Instead of checking all numbers up to \\( n-1 \\), you only check up to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n\n4. **Mathematical Insight**: If no number less than or equal to the square root of \\( n \\) divides \\( n \\), then \\( n \\) must be a prime number. This is because if \\( n \\) is not a prime, it must have a divisor other than 1 and itself within the range of 2 to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n\nThis is why you use the loop from 2 to \\( \\text{int}(\\sqrt{n}) + 1 \\) in your function. It effectively and efficiently checks for potential factors, ensuring that your function works correctly and optimally."
