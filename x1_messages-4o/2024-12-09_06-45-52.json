All models are trying to use all available GPUs, which results in an OUT_OF_MEMORY_ERROR. I found that I can assign a specific GPU to a Python script with `os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '1'`, but when I try to instantiate the FCN object from another script, it uses all 3 GPUs instead of using the only one assigned in the `__init__()` method. How can I limit Tensorflow to only use the specific GPU I assign?"

        "content": "To ensure that your Python application using TensorFlow only utilizes a specific GPU, you should set the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable before importing TensorFlow in your script. This environment variable masks the GPUs you want TensorFlow to see. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how you can do this:\n\n1. **Set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` Early**: Ensure that the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable is set before importing TensorFlow. This is crucial because TensorFlow will allocate resources based on this setting when it is first imported.\n\n2. **Set Environment Variable in Script**:\n   At the beginning of your main Python script, set the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable. It's important to do this before any TensorFlow imports.\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '0'  # Replace '0' with the GPU you want to use\n   import tensorflow as tf\n   ```\n\n3. **Use TensorFlow\u2019s GPU Options**:\n   You can also further configure TensorFlow to manage memory growth on a specific GPU, which can help prevent out-of-memory errors.\n\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n\n   gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')\n   if gpus:\n       try:\n           # Currently, memory growth needs to be the same across GPUs\n           for gpu in gpus:\n               tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)\n       except RuntimeError as e:\n           # Memory growth must be set before GPUs have been initialized\n           print(e)\n   ```\n\n4. **Using Logical Devices**:\n   If you want to ensure strict control over the GPU usage, you can also create logical devices. This allows you to partition a single GPU into multiple logical GPUs, each of which can be used by different processes.\n\n   ```python\n   gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')\n   if gpus:\n       # Restrict TensorFlow to only use the first GPU\n       try:\n           tf.config.experimental.set_visible_devices(gpus[0], 'GPU')\n           logical_gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_logical_devices('GPU')\n           print(len(gpus), \"Physical GPUs,\", len(logical_gpus), \"Logical GPUs\")\n       except RuntimeError as e:\n           # Visible devices must be set before GPUs have been initialized\n           print(e)\n   ```\n\n5. **Check GPU Allocation**:\n   Use `nvidia-smi` in the terminal to monitor and ensure that only the specified GPU is being used by your application.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to control which GPUs are visible and used by TensorFlow, thus avoiding the `OUT_OF_MEMORY_ERROR` by ensuring that your models only use the GPU resources you have assigned to them."
