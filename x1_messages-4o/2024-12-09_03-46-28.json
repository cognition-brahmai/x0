I want to convert the 'scores' from the classification layer to probabilities, and then use these probabilities to calculate the loss during training. I have written a piece of code to achieve this, but I am unsure whether it is correct or not. Here is my code:\n\n```python\nP = net.forward(x)\np = torch.nn.functional.softmax(P, dim=1)\nloss = torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy(P, y)\n```\n\nIs this the correct way to convert scores to probabilities and calculate loss in PyTorch? Specifically, I am not sure about passing probabilities as the input to the cross entropy loss function."

        "content": "Your approach has a small misunderstanding regarding how the `cross_entropy` function in PyTorch works. The `torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy` function expects raw scores (logits) as input, not probabilities. This is because `cross_entropy` combines `log_softmax` and `nll_loss` in one function, which is more numerically stable than applying `softmax` followed by `log` separately.\n\nHere is what you should do:\n\n```python\nP = net.forward(x)  # Get raw scores (logits) from the network\n# Do not apply softmax here. Pass raw logits directly to cross_entropy\nloss = torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy(P, y)\n```\n\nIf you want to interpret the outputs as probabilities for any other purpose (e.g., evaluation or visualization), you can apply `softmax` outside of the training loss calculation:\n\n```python\np = torch.nn.functional.softmax(P, dim=1)  # Convert logits to probabilities for interpretation\n```\n\nBut for calculating the loss during training, you should directly use the logits (raw outputs from the network) with the `cross_entropy` function."
