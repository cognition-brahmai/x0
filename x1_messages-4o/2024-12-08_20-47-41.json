The code uses `requests` to fetch web pages and `BeautifulSoup` from `bs4` to parse HTML content.\n2. It extracts details like title, author, date, and summary from the HTML tags commonly used for these elements. However, the actual tags or structure may differ across websites, so you might need to adjust the code for specific sites.\n3. The articles' URLs provided in the code are hypothetical examples. You may need to replace them with actual URLs of recent or popular articles from the respective websites.\n4. The Excel file is saved as `nlp_articles.xlsx` in the current working directory. You will need `pandas` and `openpyxl` (or `xlsxwriter`) installed to write to Excel.\n\nBefore running the code, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:\n\n```bash\npip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas openpyxl\n```"
