These elements are supposed to be stored in an existing file (which is not empty). But, when I try to load these elements using pickle in the following code, the error occurs. \n\nCode:\n```python\ndef array():\n\n    name = 'puntos.df4'\n\n    m = open(name, 'rb')\n    v = []*5000\n\n    m.seek(-5000, io.SEEK_END)\n    fp = m.tell()\n    sz = os.path.getsize(name)\n\n    while fp < sz:\n        pt = pickle.load(m)\n        v.append(pt)\n\n    m.close()\n    return v\n```\nThe error I get is:\n```python\nline 23, in array\npt = pickle.load(m)\n_pickle.UnpicklingError: invalid load key, ''.\n```"

        "content": "The error `_pickle.UnpicklingError: invalid load key, ''` typically occurs when the data being unpickled is not valid pickle data. In your case, there are a few potential issues in your code that might be causing this error:\n\n1. **File Content**: If the file `'puntos.df4'` contains non-pickle data (or is corrupted), attempting to unpickle it will result in an error. Ensure that the file contains only valid pickle data.\n\n2. **File Positioning**: The use of `m.seek(-5000, io.SEEK_END)` is problematic if the file size is smaller than 5000 bytes or if the file size is not a multiple of the size of the individual pickled objects. This could lead to seeking to an invalid position, causing incorrect data to be read.\n\n3. **Empty or Misaligned Data**: If the file contains records that are not aligned properly (for instance, if you attempt to read from the middle of a pickled object), it will result in an error.\n\n4. **Incorrect Initialization of List**: The line `v = []*5000` is not creating a list of 5000 elements, but rather an empty list. This doesn't directly cause the error, but it might be worth correcting for clarity.\n\nHere is a revised version of your function with some adjustments:\n\n```python\nimport pickle\nimport os\nimport io\n\ndef array():\n    name = 'puntos.df4'\n    \n    # Open the file in binary read mode\n    with open(name, 'rb') as m:\n        v = []\n        \n        # Ensure the file is positioned at the start\n        m.seek(0, io.SEEK_SET)\n        \n        # Read until the end of the file\n        while True:\n            try:\n                pt = pickle.load(m)\n                v.append(pt)\n            except EOFError:\n                # End of file reached\n                break\n            except pickle.UnpicklingError as e:\n                # Handle or log specific unpickling errors\n                print(f\"Unpickling error: {e}\")\n                break\n\n    return v\n```\n\nChanges made:\n- Removed the `m.seek(-5000, io.SEEK_END)`. Instead, start reading from the beginning of the file, which is more typical when dealing with pickle files.\n- Used a `while True` loop with exception handling to catch the end of the file or any unpickling errors.\n- Used a `with` statement to handle file opening and closing automatically.\n\nThis approach reads the entire contents of the file, unpickling each object until the end of the file is reached. Make sure that the file `puntos.df4` contains only valid, properly aligned pickle data."
