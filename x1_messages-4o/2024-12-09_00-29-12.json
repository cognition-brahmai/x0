I would like to have them plotted separately, as shown in the image. Here is my current code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ngridnumber = range(1,4)\n\nb1 = plt.bar(gridnumber, [0.2, 0.3, 0.1], width=0.4,\n                label=\"Bar 1\", align=\"center\")\n\nb2 = plt.bar(gridnumber, [0.3, 0.2, 0.2], color=\"red\", width=0.4,\n                label=\"Bar 2\", align=\"center\")\n\nplt.ylim([0,0.5])\nplt.xlim([0,4])\nplt.xticks(gridnumber)\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```"

        "content": "To plot the bar graphs side by side (also known as \"dodged\") in Matplotlib, you need to adjust the X coordinates of the bars so that they don't overlap. You can achieve this by offsetting the positions of the bars for each group. Here's how you can modify your code to plot the bars side by side:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ngridnumber = range(1, 4)\nwidth = 0.4  # Width of each bar\n\n# Adjust the positions for each bar group\nb1_positions = [x - width/2 for x in gridnumber]\nb2_positions = [x + width/2 for x in gridnumber]\n\n# Plot the bars with adjusted positions\nb1 = plt.bar(b1_positions, [0.2, 0.3, 0.1], width=width, label=\"Bar 1\", align=\"center\")\nb2 = plt.bar(b2_positions, [0.3, 0.2, 0.2], color=\"red\", width=width, label=\"Bar 2\", align=\"center\")\n\nplt.ylim([0, 0.5])\nplt.xlim([0, 4])\nplt.xticks(gridnumber)  # Keep the original grid numbers for x-ticks\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this updated code, the `b1_positions` are shifted slightly to the left and the `b2_positions` are shifted slightly to the right, allowing the bars to be displayed side by side without overlapping."
