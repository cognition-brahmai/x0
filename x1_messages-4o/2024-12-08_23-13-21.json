Mathematically, this can be represented as c^2 = a^2 + b^2, where c is the length of the hypotenuse and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides. \nIn MATLAB, we can use this theorem to calculate the length of the hypotenuse given the lengths of the other two sides using the following code:\na = 3; % length of first side\nb = 4; % length of second side\nc = sqrt(a^2 + b^2); % calculate length of hypotenuse\ndisp(['The length of the hypotenuse is ' num2str(c)]);\nThis code first assigns values to the variables a and b, representing the lengths of the other two sides of the right triangle. It then calculates the length of the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean Theorem and assigns the result to the variable c. Finally, the code uses the disp function to print out a message displaying the calculated length of the hypotenuse."

        "content": "Certainly! The example you provided is a straightforward demonstration of how to use the Pythagorean Theorem in MATLAB to calculate the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle. Let's break down the code and discuss how it works:\n\n```matlab\n% Define the lengths of the two sides of the triangle\na = 3; % Length of the first side\nb = 4; % Length of the second side\n\n% Calculate the length of the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean Theorem\nc = sqrt(a^2 + b^2);\n\n% Display the result\ndisp(['The length of the hypotenuse is ' num2str(c)]);\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Variable Assignment**:\n   - `a = 3;` assigns the value 3 to the variable `a`, representing the length of one side of the triangle.\n   - `b = 4;` assigns the value 4 to the variable `b`, representing the length of the other side of the triangle.\n\n2. **Hypotenuse Calculation**:\n   - `c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2);` calculates the length of the hypotenuse `c` using the Pythagorean Theorem (`c^2 = a^2 + b^2`). The `sqrt` function computes the square root of the sum of the squares of `a` and `b`.\n\n3. **Display the Result**:\n   - `disp(['The length of the hypotenuse is ' num2str(c)]);` uses the `disp` function to print a message that includes the calculated length of the hypotenuse. The `num2str` function converts the numeric value of `c` to a string so that it can be concatenated with the rest of the message.\n\nThis example demonstrates a simple application of the Pythagorean Theorem in MATLAB. You can change the values of `a` and `b` to compute the hypotenuse for different right triangles."
