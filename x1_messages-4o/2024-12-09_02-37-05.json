I am currently using the following code: \n\n```python\nconfigfiles = glob.glob('C:/Users/sam/Desktop/file1/*.txt')\n```\nHowever, it seems to be unable to access the subfolders. Is there a way to modify this command to also search within subfolders?"

        "content": "Certainly! The `glob.glob` function by itself doesn't recursively search through subdirectories. However, you can achieve this by using the `**` pattern in combination with setting the `recursive` parameter to `True`. Here's how you can modify your code to search for text files in subfolders:\n\n```python\nimport glob\n\n# Use '**' to include subdirectories, and set recursive=True\nconfigfiles = glob.glob('C:/Users/sam/Desktop/file1/**/*.txt', recursive=True)\n\n# Print the list of text files found\nfor file in configfiles:\n    print(file)\n```\n\nIn this modified version, `**` is used as a wildcard that matches any files and zero or more directories and subdirectories. Setting `recursive=True` enables the recursive search feature. This way, your search will include all text files within the specified directory and any of its subdirectories."
