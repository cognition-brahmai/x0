The first line should paint a peaceful picture, the second line should introduce a natural element, the third line should describe a contrasting element, the fourth line should contrast the two elements, and the fifth line should leave the reader with a sense of wonder. Can you provide an example code snippet to help me get started?\n[Swift code]\nfunc createHaiku() -> String {\n   let line1 = \"Sunset over hills,\"\n   let line2 = \"Raindrops kiss the leaves below,\"\n   let line3 = \"A rainbow appears.\"\n   let line4 = \"Contrasting hues, nature's art,\"\n   let line5 = \"Captivating souls with awe.\"\n   return \"\\(line1)\\n\\(line2)\\n\\(line3)\\n\\(line4)\\n\\(line5)\"\n}"
