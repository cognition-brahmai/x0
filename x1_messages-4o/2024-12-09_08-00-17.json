However, on my machine it opens Internet Explorer instead of Chrome which is my default browser. I found an answer online suggesting that I need to register the browser, but I'm uncertain about how to use webbrowser.register() and the provided documentation does not seem clear. How can I register Chrome in Python so that URLs passed to webbrowser.open() open in Chrome instead of Internet Explorer?"

        "content": "To ensure that URLs open in Google Chrome using Python's `webbrowser` module, you can register Chrome as a browser and then use it to open URLs. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Locate the Chrome Executable:**\n   First, you need to know the path to the Chrome executable on your machine. On Windows, this is typically something like `C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe`.\n\n2. **Register Chrome with the webbrowser Module:**\n   Use the `webbrowser.register()` function to specify Chrome as a browser to be used by the module.\n\n3. **Open URLs with Chrome:**\n   Use the `webbrowser.get()` function to retrieve the Chrome browser and open the URL.\n\nHere is an example code snippet demonstrating how to do this:\n\n```python\nimport webbrowser\nimport os\n\n# Path to the Chrome executable\nchrome_path = \"C:/Program Files/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe\"\n\n# Registering Chrome as the web browser\nwebbrowser.register('chrome', None, webbrowser.BackgroundBrowser(chrome_path))\n\n# Get the Chrome browser and open a URL\nwebbrowser.get('chrome').open('http://www.example.com')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`webbrowser.register()`**: This function registers a new browser type. `BackgroundBrowser` is used to open the browser in a separate process.\n- **`webbrowser.get()`**: This function retrieves the specified browser type, allowing you to open URLs with it.\n\nMake sure that the path to your Chrome executable is correct. If Chrome is installed in a different directory, you'll need to update the `chrome_path` variable accordingly. This setup should ensure that URLs are opened in Chrome instead of Internet Explorer."
