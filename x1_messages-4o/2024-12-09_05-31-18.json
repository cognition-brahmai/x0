        "content": "Thrust is a high-level C++ template library that provides a convenient and powerful interface for CUDA programming. However, it doesn't natively encapsulate all CUDA libraries, such as CUFFT, which is specifically designed for fast Fourier transforms on NVIDIA GPUs.\n\nTo use CUFFT in conjunction with Thrust, you'll typically need to manage the CUFFT operations separately, since Thrust doesn't provide direct wrappers for CUFFT functions. However, you can still integrate the two by following these general steps:\n\n1. **Allocate Memory:** Use Thrust to allocate device memory for your input and output data. Thrust's device vectors are useful for managing memory on the GPU.\n\n   ```cpp\n   thrust::device_vector<cufftComplex> d_signal(N); // For complex data\n   ```\n\n2. **Data Initialization:** Initialize your data in the Thrust device vector as needed.\n\n3. **Plan and Execute CUFFT:** Use the CUFFT library to plan and execute FFT operations. You'll need to create a CUFFT plan, execute the FFT, and then destroy the plan once you're done.\n\n   ```cpp\n   cufftHandle plan;\n   cufftPlan1d(&plan, N, CUFFT_C2C, 1); // For 1D complex-to-complex FFT\n\n   // Execute forward FFT\n   cufftExecC2C(plan, thrust::raw_pointer_cast(d_signal.data()), thrust::raw_pointer_cast(d_signal.data()), CUFFT_FORWARD);\n   ```\n\n4. **Post-Processing:** Once CUFFT has computed the transform, you can use Thrust for any additional processing on the data.\n\n5. **Cleanup:** Destroy the CUFFT plan to free resources.\n\n   ```cpp\n   cufftDestroy(plan);\n   ```\n\nWhile there isn't a direct encapsulation of CUFFT within Thrust, the approach of combining Thrust for memory management and CUFFT for FFT operations is quite effective. This allows you to leverage the strengths of both libraries: Thrust's ease of use for device memory management and CUFFT's optimized FFT performance. If you find yourself needing to frequently combine these operations, you might consider writing your own utility functions to streamline the process."
