I have attempted to implement this functionality with the following code:\n\n```python\nimport urllib2\nproxy_handler = urllib2.ProxyHandler({\"tcp\":\"http://127.0.0.1:9050\"})\nopener = urllib2.build_opener(proxy_handler)\nurllib2.install_opener(opener)\n```\n\nHowever, it seems to be not working as my IP address remains the same even after I use Tor, which I checked using Python itself."

        "content": "To configure `urllib2` (or `urllib` in Python 3) to make requests through Tor, you need to ensure that the requests are routed through the Tor network. Tor typically listens on port 9050 for SOCKS5 connections, not HTTP, which is a common mistake. You will also need to use a library that supports SOCKS5 proxies, such as `socks` or `requests`.\n\nHere's how you can use the `PySocks` library (which is bundled with `requests` via `requests[socks]`) to configure your requests to go through Tor:\n\n1. **Install the necessary package**:\n   If you haven't already, you will need to install the `PySocks` library. You can do this using pip:\n\n   ```\n   pip install requests[socks]\n   ```\n\n2. **Adapt your code to use SOCKS5 proxy**:\n   You need to modify your code to use a library that supports SOCKS5. Here is an example using `requests`:\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n\n   # Configure the proxy to use Tor\n   proxies = {\n       'http': 'socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050',\n       'https': 'socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050'\n   }\n\n   # Make a request through the proxy\n   response = requests.get('http://icanhazip.com', proxies=proxies)\n   print(response.text)\n   ```\n\n3. **Ensure Tor is running**:\n   Ensure that the Tor service is running on your machine. On most systems, you can start Tor with the command:\n\n   ```\n   tor\n   ```\n\n   If you are using a Tor Browser, ensure it is open and configured to accept connections on port 9050.\n\n4. **Verify the IP address**:\n   The above code will fetch your public IP address by making a request through Tor. If Tor is configured correctly, the IP address printed should be different from your actual IP address.\n\nBy using `requests` with the `socks5h` protocol, you ensure that your requests are routed through the Tor network, and you should see a different IP address indicating a successful connection through Tor."
