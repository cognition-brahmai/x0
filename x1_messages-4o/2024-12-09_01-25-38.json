The link should work in Sphinx as well as other Python IDEs like Spyder. Here's the structure I have in mymodule.py:\n\n```python\ndef class MyClass():\n    def foo(self):\n        print 'foo'\n    def bar(self):\n        \"\"\"This method does the same as <link to foo>\"\"\"\n        print 'foo'\n```\n\nI have tried the following options for `<link to foo>`:\n\n- :func:`foo`\n- :func:`self.foo`\n- :func:`MyClass.foo`\n- :func:`mymodule.MyClass.foo`\n\nThe only option that produces a link is :func:`mymodule.MyClass.foo`, but it shows the link as `mymodule.MyClass.foo()`. I want the link to be shown as `foo()` or `foo`. However, none of these options produce a link in Spyder. Any suggestions?"

        "content": "To create a link to another method within the same class in a way that works with Sphinx and potentially with IDEs like Spyder, you can use a combination of Sphinx's referencing system and some customization for how the link is displayed.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Sphinx Docstring Formatting:**\n\n   In Sphinx, you can create a cross-reference to another method using the `:meth:` role. To customize the text that appears for the link, you can use the `~` (tilde) syntax to shorten the displayed link text. Here's how you can modify your `bar` method's docstring:\n\n   ```python\n   class MyClass:\n       def foo(self):\n           \"\"\"Prints 'foo'.\"\"\"\n           print('foo')\n\n       def bar(self):\n           \"\"\"This method does the same as :meth:`~MyClass.foo`.\"\"\"\n           self.foo()\n   ```\n\n   Here, `:meth:`~MyClass.foo`` will create a link to the `foo` method, but only display `foo` as the link text.\n\n2. **Spyder and Other IDEs:**\n\n   Not all IDEs, including Spyder, support Sphinx-style markup in docstrings directly in the editor. They might display the raw text instead. However, by using Sphinx to generate HTML documentation, you can ensure the links appear correctly in the generated docs.\n\n3. **Generating Documentation with Sphinx:**\n\n   - Ensure your project is set up to use Sphinx. You typically need a `conf.py` and an `index.rst` file.\n   - Use Sphinx's autodoc feature to extract docstrings and generate documentation.\n   - Run `sphinx-build` in your project directory to generate the HTML documentation.\n\n4. **Alternative for IDEs:**\n\n   Since direct linking in docstrings might not work in all IDEs, consider adding inline comments or references in a more IDE-friendly manner, such as adding a note directly in the code or using descriptive comments.\n\nBy using the Sphinx documentation generator, you can ensure the links are displayed correctly in the generated HTML documents. While IDEs like Spyder might not render these links, the generated documentation will give you the desired outcome."
