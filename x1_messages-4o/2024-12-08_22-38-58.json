Here's a riddle for you:\n\n---\n\nIn a land where petals bask in the sun's warm glow,  \nA cube of mystery lies, with secrets to show.  \nIts volume whispers, \"64,\" in a gentle breeze,  \nCalculate its surface area with the greatest of ease.  \n\nConvert your number to a floral delight,  \nA bloom that dances in the Himalayan light.  \nWhat am I, this flower so fair?  \nIts petals tell tales in the mountain air.\n\n---\n\nTo solve this riddle:\n1. Find the side length of the cube by taking the cube root of 64.\n2. Calculate the surface area of the cube using the formula \\(6 \\times (\\text{side length})^2\\).\n3. Convert the resulting number into a flower known to grow in the Himalayan region.\n\nThe answer is \"Edelweiss,\" which corresponds to the surface area calculation and is a flower that can be found in the Himalayan region."
