For example, I have the following list: `['elm0', 'elm1', 'Elm2', 'elm9', 'elm10', 'Elm11', 'Elm12', 'elm13']`. When I use the `sorted()` function, the output is `['Elm11', 'Elm12', 'Elm2', 'elm0', 'elm1', 'elm10', 'elm13', 'elm9']`. However, I would like the output to be in natural sort order as in the first list."

        "content": "Python's built-in `sorted()` function sorts strings lexicographically by default, which means it sorts based on the ASCII values of the characters. This can result in the order you've observed, where numbers within strings are not treated numerically.\n\nTo achieve a natural sort order, where numbers within strings are sorted numerically, you can use the `natsort` library, which is designed for this purpose. First, you'll need to install the library if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install natsort\n```\n\nThen, you can use the `natsorted()` function from the `natsort` library to sort your list naturally:\n\n```python\nfrom natsort import natsorted\n\ndata = ['elm0', 'elm1', 'Elm2', 'elm9', 'elm10', 'Elm11', 'Elm12', 'elm13']\nsorted_data = natsorted(data, key=lambda x: x.lower())  # Use case-insensitive sorting\n\nprint(sorted_data)\n```\n\nThis will give you the desired natural sort order output:\n\n```\n['elm0', 'elm1', 'Elm2', 'elm9', 'elm10', 'Elm11', 'Elm12', 'elm13']\n```\n\nBy using the `natsorted()` function with a key function to handle case insensitivity (`key=lambda x: x.lower()`), you can achieve the natural sorting you want."
