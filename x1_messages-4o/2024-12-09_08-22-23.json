More specifically, I want to link a file named 'install.rst' to my quickstart guide within a paragraph. I am not sure how to accomplish this. Also, could you recommend a comprehensive resource for learning the syntax of reST? The default quickstart guide is not detailed enough for my needs. The documentation I am working on is located at http://todx.rtfd.io."

        "content": "To insert a reference to another reST (reStructuredText) document within your documentation, you can use the `:doc:` role provided by Sphinx, which is a popular documentation generator that uses reST. Assuming you are using Sphinx, here's how you can link to the 'install.rst' file from your quickstart guide:\n\n```rst\nFor more detailed installation instructions, please refer to the :doc:`installation guide <install>`.\n```\n\nIn this example, `<install>` is the name of the target document without the '.rst' extension. Make sure that 'install.rst' is in the same directory as the document you are linking from, or adjust the path accordingly if it is located in a subdirectory.\n\nIf you are not using Sphinx, you might need to adjust your approach based on the specific tool you are using to process your reST files.\n\nRegarding a comprehensive resource for learning reST syntax, here are a few recommendations:\n\n1. **Sphinx Official Documentation**: If you are using Sphinx, their official documentation is a great resource for understanding how to use reST with Sphinx-specific extensions. You can find it here: [Sphinx Documentation](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).\n\n2. **reStructuredText Primer**: The Docutils project provides a good primer on reStructuredText syntax. It covers the basics and is a great starting point: [reStructuredText Primer](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/rst/quickstart.html).\n\n3. **reStructuredText Markup Specification**: For a more in-depth understanding of reST, the official specification is the most comprehensive resource: [reStructuredText Markup Specification](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html).\n\n4. **\"Writing Documentation\" by Jacob Kaplan-Moss**: This is a well-regarded guide that covers documentation processes, tools, and writing practices, including reST: [Writing Documentation](https://jacobian.org/writing/what-to-write/).\n\nThese resources should help you get a better grasp of reST syntax and how to effectively use it in your documentation projects."
