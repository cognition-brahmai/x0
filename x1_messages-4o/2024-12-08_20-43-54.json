Your preference is a medium-sized t-shirt, but unfortunately, the search bar is malfunctioning. Your task is to narrow down your search for medium-sized t-shirts. However, to make it more challenging, you cannot use the search bar or the filter options directly. Instead, you must use your knowledge of color and material to filter out the t-shirts that are not medium-sized. For instance, try selecting only the black or white t-shirts and then determine which material is suitable for a medium size. Can you solve this puzzle and find the perfect t-shirt?"

        "content": "Certainly! If you're browsing through an e-commerce website without using the search bar or filters, here's a strategy you can use to identify medium-sized t-shirts based on color and material:\n\n1. **Color Selection**: Focus on visually identifying t-shirts that are black or white. These colors are generally versatile and popular, making them more likely to be available in multiple sizes, including medium.\n\n2. **Material Consideration**: Different materials often have different fits. For medium-sized t-shirts, look for materials known for their flexibility and comfort, such as:\n   - **Cotton**: A classic choice, known for its breathability and softness. Cotton t-shirts often fit true to size.\n   - **Blend Fabrics**: Often a mix of cotton and polyester, these fabrics provide a good fit and are less likely to shrink.\n   - **Jersey Knit**: This material is stretchy and soft, ensuring a comfortable fit that adapts to different body shapes.\n\n3. **Visual Inspection**: As you browse, keep an eye on the product images and descriptions that might include size indicators or models wearing the t-shirts. Sometimes, product listings will show the model's size which can give you an idea of how the t-shirt might fit someone of a medium build.\n\n4. **Check Reviews**: Look at customer reviews for comments about fit. Often, previous buyers will mention if the t-shirt runs small, large, or true to size.\n\n5. **Brand Familiarity**: If you recognize certain brands that you know fit well in a medium size, prioritize those. Brands often have consistent sizing across their products.\n\nBy using these strategies, you should be able to narrow down your selection to find the perfect medium-sized black or white t-shirt, even without direct search or filter functionalities."
