Just replace `your_date_here` with the specific date you're interested in:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM Orders\nWHERE order_date >= 'your_date_here'\n  AND order_status = 'completed'\nORDER BY order_date\nLIMIT 10;\n```\n\nThis query selects all columns from the \"Orders\" table where the `order_date` is on or after the specified date and the `order_status` is \"completed\". It orders the results by `order_date` and limits the output to the first 10 records."
