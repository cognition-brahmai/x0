        "content": "Can you solve this land division puzzle? You have a rectangular piece of land with dimensions A x B. Your task is to divide this land into smaller rectangular plots, all with the same dimensions C x D, so that the total perimeter of the smaller rectangular plots is minimized. Remember, you cannot leave any unused area in the larger rectangular plot. What is the maximum number of smaller rectangular plots that you can create, and what should be the dimensions of each? Put on your thinking cap and apply the principle of minimizing waste to solve this puzzle!"

        "content": "To tackle this land division puzzle, we need to focus on dividing the larger rectangular piece of land (with dimensions A x B) into smaller, identical rectangular plots (with dimensions C x D) such that the total perimeter of these plots is minimized and the entire area is utilized without any waste.\n\nGiven that the entire area must be utilized, the number of smaller plots you can create is determined by how well the dimensions A x B can be divided by C x D.\n\n1. **Calculate the Number of Smaller Plots:**\n\n   - The number of plots along the length of A is \\( n = \\frac{A}{C} \\) (assuming C divides A perfectly).\n   - The number of plots along the width of B is \\( m = \\frac{B}{D} \\) (assuming D divides B perfectly).\n\n   Therefore, the maximum number of smaller plots is \\( n \\times m = \\frac{A}{C} \\times \\frac{B}{D} \\).\n\n2. **Minimize the Perimeter:**\n\n   The perimeter of each smaller plot is \\( 2 \\times (C + D) \\).\n\n   The total perimeter for all the plots is given by:\n\n   \\[\n   P_{\\text{total}} = nm \\times 2 \\times (C + D)\n   \\]\n\n   To minimize this perimeter, you would ideally want the dimensions C and D to be as large as possible, because fewer plots with larger dimensions will have less total perimeter than many small plots with smaller dimensions.\n\n3. **Optimal Dimensions:**\n\n   - If C and D are divisors of A and B, respectively, then this is optimal.\n   - If not, you might have to consider the greatest common divisor (GCD) approach, where you choose C and D such that they are the largest possible divisors fitting into A and B.\n\nIn practical terms, the solution involves ensuring that C and D are chosen in such a way that they are divisors of A and B and are the largest possible to minimize the perimeter while also maximizing the number of plots.\n\nThus, the problem boils down to finding the largest C and D such that \\( C \\mid A \\) and \\( D \\mid B \\), which will maximize the number of plots and minimize the perimeter."
