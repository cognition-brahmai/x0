        "content": "Certainly! Let's break down the code step by step to understand how it works, and then I'll explain how you can modify it for different names.\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n\n1. **Initialize the Full Name:**\n   ```python\n   full_name = \"Captain Jack Sparrow\"\n   ```\n   This line initializes a variable `full_name` with the string \"Captain Jack Sparrow\". This is the full name of the pirate protagonist in your example.\n\n2. **Extract the First Name:**\n   ```python\n   first_name = full_name.split()[0]\n   ```\n   - The `split()` method is used on the `full_name` string, which splits the string into a list of words based on spaces. So, `\"Captain Jack Sparrow\".split()` results in `[\"Captain\", \"Jack\", \"Sparrow\"]`.\n   - `[0]` is used to access the first element of the list, which is `\"Captain\"` in this case.\n\n3. **Extract the Last Name:**\n   ```python\n   last_name = full_name.split()[-1]\n   ```\n   - Similarly, `[-1]` is used to access the last element of the list, which is `\"Sparrow\"`.\n\n4. **Calculate the Sum of Letters:**\n   ```python\n   sum_of_letters = len(first_name) + len(last_name)\n   ```\n   - `len(first_name)` calculates the number of characters in the first name, which is 7 for \"Captain\".\n   - `len(last_name)` calculates the number of characters in the last name, which is 7 for \"Sparrow\".\n   - The sum of these lengths is calculated and stored in `sum_of_letters`.\n\n5. **Print the Result:**\n   ```python\n   print(\"The sum of the letters in the first and last name of the protagonist is:\", sum_of_letters)\n   ```\n   - This line prints the result to the console.\n\n### How to Modify the Code:\n\nIf you want to calculate the sum of the letters in the first and last name for a different protagonist, you simply need to change the `full_name` variable to the new name. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nfull_name = \"Anne Bonny\"  # Replace with another pirate protagonist's name\nfirst_name = full_name.split()[0]\nlast_name = full_name.split()[-1]\nsum_of_letters = len(first_name) + len(last_name)\nprint(\"The sum of the letters in the first and last name of the protagonist is:\", sum_of_letters)\n```\n\nReplace `\"Anne Bonny\"` with any other name you wish to use, and the program will automatically calculate and print the sum of the letters in the first and last name of that character."
