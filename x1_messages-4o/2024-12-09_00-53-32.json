I have tried using 'data_only = True' while loading the workbook to get the computed cell value. However, this is not giving me the current cell value but rather the value that was stored the last time Excel read the sheet. Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nwbFile = openpyxl.load_workbook(filename = xxxx, data_only=True)\nwsFile = wbFile[c_sSheet]\n```\nHow can I read the actual current value of the cell in Excel using openpyxl?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is due to how `openpyxl` handles formulas and their results. When you load a workbook with `data_only=True`, `openpyxl` will give you the last calculated value stored in the Excel file, not the current value computed by Excel or any add-in.\n\nUnfortunately, `openpyxl` cannot recalculate formulas because it doesn't have a calculation engine like Excel. It can only read the last saved values. If the Excel file was not saved after the web service add-in updated the cell, `openpyxl` will not be able to see the new value.\n\nHere are a few workarounds you might consider:\n\n1. **Save with Excel**: Ensure the Excel file is saved after the web service updates the values. You would then be able to read the updated values using `openpyxl`.\n\n2. **Use a different library**: Use a library that can interact with Excel's COM interface, such as `xlwings`, which allows you to execute Excel functions and get real-time values from Excel. Here is a basic example using `xlwings`:\n\n   ```python\n   import xlwings as xw\n\n   # Open the Excel application\n   app = xw.App(visible=False)  # Set to False if you want to hide the Excel window\n   wb = xw.Book('path_to_your_file.xlsx')\n   ws = wb.sheets[c_sSheet]\n\n   # Read the value from a specific cell\n   cell_value = ws.range('A1').value  # Change 'A1' to the cell you want to read\n\n   # Don't forget to close the workbook and app\n   wb.close()\n   app.quit()\n\n   print(cell_value)\n   ```\n\n   Note that `xlwings` requires Excel to be installed on your machine because it interacts directly with it.\n\n3. **Automate Excel Saving**: If you have control over the Excel add-in or the process that updates the Excel file, you might automate the process to save the workbook after updates, ensuring the latest values are stored.\n\nEach approach has its own use cases and limitations, so choose the one that best fits your scenario."
