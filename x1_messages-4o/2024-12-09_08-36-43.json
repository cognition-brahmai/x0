However, I've noticed that when testing the pattern with the string '12345121,223456,123123,3234,4523,523523', it doesn't seem to evaluate, even after several minutes. On the other hand, the expression executes almost instantly with the string '12345121,223456,123123,3234,4523,523523/'. There were no matches expected in the first case. Is this a bug in my code?"

        "content": "The behavior you're encountering is likely due to the way your regular expression is constructed. Specifically, the pattern `r'(\\d+(,)?)+/$'` can lead to what's known as \"catastrophic backtracking\" when it doesn't find a match, especially with long strings like `'12345121,223456,123123,3234,4523,523523'`.\n\nLet's break down the pattern:\n\n- `\\d+` matches one or more digits.\n- `(,)?` makes the comma optional after the digits.\n- `(\\d+(,)?)+` means you want one or more groups of digits optionally followed by a comma.\n- `/$` expects the string to end with a slash.\n\nIn the case of the string without the trailing slash (`'12345121,223456,123123,3234,4523,523523'`), the regex engine tries numerous combinations to fulfill the pattern, which involves a lot of unnecessary backtracking, making it inefficient.\n\nTo improve this, you can be more specific about what you're matching:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Correct pattern\npattern = r'^\\d+(?:,\\d+)*\\/$'\n\n# Test strings\ntest_string_with_slash = '12345121,223456,123123,3234,4523,523523/'\ntest_string_without_slash = '12345121,223456,123123,3234,4523,523523'\n\n# Matching\nmatch_with_slash = re.match(pattern, test_string_with_slash)\nmatch_without_slash = re.match(pattern, test_string_without_slash)\n\nprint(bool(match_with_slash))  # Should be True\nprint(bool(match_without_slash))  # Should be False\n```\n\nKey changes in the pattern:\n\n- `^\\d+` ensures the string starts with digits.\n- `(?:,\\d+)*` matches zero or more occurrences of a comma followed by digits, preventing unnecessary backtracking.\n- `/` requires a trailing slash.\n- `$` ensures the string ends with a slash.\n\nThis pattern should perform efficiently and give you the expected results."
