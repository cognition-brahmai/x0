When I compile, I get warnings that libGL.so, libGLU.so, and libX11.so are not found, even though these libraries do exist on the system. I've tried symlinking to /usr/lib/libGL.so with the nvidia-352 version but it doesn't resolve the issue. I am concerned about causing damage to the system as I've had issues with drivers suddenly not working when I start manipulating this kind of stuff. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "It sounds like you are facing issues with the linker not being able to find the necessary OpenGL libraries when compiling the 5_Simulations directory. This is a common issue when dealing with CUDA and OpenGL on Linux systems, especially when considering different library versions and locations. Here are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Identify Library Locations**:\n   First, confirm the locations of the required libraries on your system. You can use the `locate` or `find` command:\n   ```bash\n   locate libGL.so\n   locate libGLU.so\n   locate libX11.so\n   ```\n\n2. **Update `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`**:\n   If the libraries are not in standard locations, you can temporarily add their directories to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. This can help the linker find them during compilation:\n   ```bash\n   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/libGL:/path/to/libGLU:/path/to/libX11:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Development Packages**:\n   Ensure that you have the development packages for OpenGL and X11 installed. On a Debian-based system like Linux Mint, you can install them via:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install build-essential libgl1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libx11-dev\n   ```\n\n4. **Check Symlinks**:\n   Double-check the symlinks you created. They should point to the correct versions of the libraries. Remove any incorrect symlinks and recreate them if necessary:\n   ```bash\n   sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/nvidia-352/libGL.so /usr/lib/libGL.so\n   sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/nvidia-352/libGLU.so /usr/lib/libGLU.so\n   sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/nvidia-352/libX11.so /usr/lib/libX11.so\n   ```\n\n5. **Modify the Makefile**:\n   You may need to manually specify the library paths in the Makefile of the project you are compiling. Look for lines that specify linker flags, usually starting with `-L` (for library paths) and `-l` (for library names), and modify them to include the correct paths.\n\n6. **Reinstall or Update CUDA and NVIDIA Drivers**:\n   If the above steps don\u2019t work, consider reinstalling or updating CUDA and NVIDIA drivers to ensure there are no installation issues. Use the official NVIDIA and CUDA repositories for this purpose.\n\n7. **Verify Compiler and CUDA Toolkit Compatibility**:\n   Ensure that the compiler you are using is compatible with the version of the CUDA toolkit installed on your system. Sometimes, newer versions of GCC may not be compatible with older CUDA toolkits and vice versa.\n\nIf you follow these steps and still encounter issues, please provide additional details such as the exact error messages received during compilation. That way, I can assist you further."
