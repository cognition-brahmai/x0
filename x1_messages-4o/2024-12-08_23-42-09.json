        "content": "To modify your Go program to find all prime factors of a given number while ensuring that the time complexity remains under \\(O(\\sqrt{n})\\), you can enhance your existing factor-finding code by incorporating primality checks and optimizations. Below is an example of how you might achieve this:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"math\"\n)\n\nfunc primeFactors(n int) []int {\n\tpfactors := []int{}\n\n\t// Check for number of 2s in n\n\tfor n%2 == 0 {\n\t\tpfactors = append(pfactors, 2)\n\t\tn /= 2\n\t}\n\n\t// Check for odd factors from 3 to sqrt(n)\n\tfor i := 3; i <= int(math.Sqrt(float64(n))); i += 2 {\n\t\tfor n%i == 0 {\n\t\t\tpfactors = append(pfactors, i)\n\t\t\tn /= i\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t// If n is a prime number greater than 2\n\tif n > 2 {\n\t\tpfactors = append(pfactors, n)\n\t}\n\n\treturn pfactors\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tnumber := 315\n\tfmt.Printf(\"Prime factors of %d are: %v\\n\", number, primeFactors(number))\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Divisibility by 2:** The code first checks how many times `2` divides into the number `n` and appends it to the list of prime factors. This step efficiently handles all even numbers.\n\n2. **Odd Factor Check:** After removing all factors of `2`, the code checks for odd numbers starting from `3` up to the square root of `n`. This is efficient because any larger factor of `n` must be paired with a smaller factor.\n\n3. **Handling Remaining Prime:** If after removing all smaller factors the number `n` is still greater than `2`, it must be prime, and it is added to the list of prime factors.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds all prime factors with a time complexity of \\(O(\\sqrt{n})\\), as it limits the number of iterations significantly by only checking up to the square root of `n` and skipping even numbers after handling `2`."
