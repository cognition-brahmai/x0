I have an array like this:\n\n<pre><code>a = [ 0, 47, 48, 49, 50, 97, 98, 99]\n</code></pre>\n\nI need to cluster these elements into groups where each group contains consecutive numbers. The output should look like this:\n\n<pre><code>[(0), (47, 48, 49, 50), (97, 98, 99)]\n</code></pre>\n\nIdeally, I would like to be able to specify the difference between the consecutive numbers, it could be a limit or a hardcoded number. Any ideas on how to do this?"

        "content": "You can achieve this by iterating through the array and grouping consecutive numbers based on a specified difference. Here's a Python function that uses NumPy to group the consecutive elements:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef group_consecutive_numbers(arr, diff=1):\n    # Convert the input list to a numpy array\n    arr = np.array(arr)\n    # Find the indices where the difference between consecutive elements is greater than the specified difference\n    split_indices = np.where(np.diff(arr) > diff)[0] + 1\n    # Use np.split to divide the array into groups based on the indices found\n    groups = np.split(arr, split_indices)\n    # Convert the list of arrays into a list of tuples for the desired output format\n    grouped_tuples = [tuple(group) for group in groups]\n    return grouped_tuples\n\n# Example usage\na = [0, 47, 48, 49, 50, 97, 98, 99]\nresult = group_consecutive_numbers(a, diff=1)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `group_consecutive_numbers` function takes two arguments: the input array `arr` and the `diff`, which specifies the maximum difference allowed between consecutive numbers to be considered part of the same group. The default value for `diff` is 1, which means that only directly consecutive numbers will be grouped together. You can adjust this value as needed.\n\nWhen you run the code with the provided array `a`, the output will be:\n\n```\n[(0,), (47, 48, 49, 50), (97, 98, 99)]\n```\n\nThis will give you the desired grouping of consecutive numbers."
