Here is an array of population data for a city over the years:\nlet population = [100, 150, 225, 337, 505, 758, 1137, 1705];\nUsing this data, can you write a JavaScript code that calculates the growth rate and predicts the population for the next 5 years assuming the growth rate remains constant?"

        "content": "Certainly! Exponential growth is a phenomenon where the rate of growth is proportional to the current size, leading to growth that accelerates over time. A common real-world example is population growth, where the population increases at a constant percentage rate over time.\n\nTo calculate the growth rate and predict future population using JavaScript, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Average Growth Rate**: We'll calculate the average growth rate between each consecutive year using the formula:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Growth Rate} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Current Year Population}}{\\text{Previous Year Population}} \\right) - 1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Average Growth Rate**: Find the average of these growth rates.\n\n3. **Project Future Population**: Use the average growth rate to project the population for the next 5 years.\n\nHere is the JavaScript code to perform these calculations:\n\n```javascript\nlet population = [100, 150, 225, 337, 505, 758, 1137, 1705];\n\n// Function to calculate average growth rate\nfunction calculateGrowthRate(population) {\n    let growthRates = [];\n    for (let i = 1; i < population.length; i++) {\n        let growthRate = (population[i] / population[i - 1]) - 1;\n        growthRates.push(growthRate);\n    }\n    \n    // Calculate average growth rate\n    let totalGrowthRate = growthRates.reduce((acc, rate) => acc + rate, 0);\n    return totalGrowthRate / growthRates.length;\n}\n\n// Calculate future population\nfunction predictPopulation(population, yearsToPredict) {\n    let growthRate = calculateGrowthRate(population);\n    let lastYearPopulation = population[population.length - 1];\n    let futurePopulation = [];\n\n    for (let i = 1; i <= yearsToPredict; i++) {\n        lastYearPopulation *= (1 + growthRate);\n        futurePopulation.push(lastYearPopulation.toFixed(0)); // Round to nearest whole number\n    }\n\n    return futurePopulation;\n}\n\nlet averageGrowthRate = calculateGrowthRate(population);\nconsole.log(\"Average Growth Rate:\", (averageGrowthRate * 100).toFixed(2) + \"%\");\n\nlet futurePopulation = predictPopulation(population, 5);\nconsole.log(\"Projected Population for Next 5 Years:\", futurePopulation);\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **calculateGrowthRate**: Computes the growth rate between each consecutive year's population and calculates the average growth rate.\n- **predictPopulation**: Uses the average growth rate to predict the population for the next five years based on the last known population.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will give you the average growth rate and the projected population for the next five years. This simple model assumes the future growth rate will remain constant as calculated from historical data."
