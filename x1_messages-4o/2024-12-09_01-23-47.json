This data set can include initial values for any of the fields. Even though the code block `if field_value:` populates the initial form dictionary attribute, the initial value isn't being displayed. Is there a way to set the initial value in the form? If so, what am I doing wrong in the following code?\n\n```python\ndef __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n    id = kwargs.pop('values_id', 0)\n    super(LaunchForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n    # Lots of code here that uses the id value\n    # to execute a query and build the form\n    # fields and their attributes from the \n    # result set\n\n    if field_value:\n        self.initial[field_name] = field_value\n```"

        "content": "In Django forms, setting initial values for fields is typically done in the `__init__` method as you have attempted. However, there are a few things to check and consider if the initial values are not being displayed as expected:\n\n1. **Ensure Field Definitions**: Make sure the fields are defined in the form class before setting their initial values. If you are dynamically creating fields, ensure that they are added to the form before you set the initial values.\n\n2. **Check for Arguments in `super()`**: When calling `super(LaunchForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)`, ensure that you are passing all necessary arguments. This call initializes the form with any data provided in `args` and `kwargs`.\n\n3. **Initial Values vs. Bound Data**: If the form is bound (i.e., if `args` contains data, typically when handling a POST request), the initial values dictionary won't affect the displayed values. Make sure that the form is not bound with data when you are setting initial values.\n\n4. **Ensure Correct `field_name` and `field_value`**: Double-check that `field_name` and `field_value` are correctly populated and correspond to actual fields in your form.\n\n5. **Debugging**: Add some debug statements to verify that `field_value` and `field_name` are being correctly populated and that `self.initial` is being updated as expected.\n\nHere's an example of how you might structure the `__init__` method to ensure proper setting of initial values:\n\n```python\ndef __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n    id = kwargs.pop('values_id', 0)\n    super(LaunchForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n    \n    # Example data; replace with actual logic to build your form fields\n    fields_data = [\n        {'field_name': 'name', 'field_value': 'John Doe'},\n        {'field_name': 'age', 'field_value': 30},\n        # Add more fields as needed\n    ]\n\n    for field in fields_data:\n        field_name = field.get('field_name')\n        field_value = field.get('field_value')\n        \n        # Ensure the field exists in the form before setting initial\n        if field_name in self.fields:\n            self.initial[field_name] = field_value\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to set initial values in your form successfully. If the problem persists, please provide more context or details about how fields are being added or any additional code you have that might be relevant."
