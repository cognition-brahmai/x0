        "content": "How can I set the state of a TensorFlow RNN when the parameter `state_is_tuple=True`? I have an RNN language model implemented as an RNN class in TensorFlow. The graph structure is built in the constructor, while the `RNN.train` and `RNN.test` methods are used to run it. I want to be able to reset the RNN state when I move to a new document in the training set, or when I want to run a validation set during training. I am doing this by managing the state inside the training loop, passing it into the graph via a feed dictionary. My current implementation has the following code for the constructor and the training loop. I want to use the recommended `state_is_tuple=True`, but I am unsure how to pass the more complex LSTM state object via a feed dictionary, and what arguments to pass to the `self.state = tf.placeholder(...)` line in my constructor. \n\n```\nConstructor:\n    cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMCell(hidden_units)\n    rnn_layers = tf.nn.rnn_cell.MultiRNNCell([cell] * layers)\n    self.reset_state = rnn_layers.zero_state(batch_size, dtype=tf.float32)\n    self.state = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, self.reset_state.get_shape(), \"state\")\n    self.outputs, self.next_state = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(rnn_layers, self.embedded_input, time_major=True,\n                                                  initial_state=self.state)\n\nTraining loop:\n for document in document:\n     state = session.run(self.reset_state)\n     for x, y in document:\n          _, state = session.run([self.train_step, self.next_state], \n                                 feed_dict={self.x:x, self.y:y, self.state:state})\n```"

        "content": "To manage the LSTM state as a tuple when `state_is_tuple=True`, you need to handle the LSTM state as a tuple of LSTMStateTuples, which consists of `(c, h)` pairs, where `c` is the cell state and `h` is the hidden state. Here's how you can modify your code to work with this:\n\n1. **Define the LSTM state placeholders as tuples**: You'll need separate placeholders for the cell state and the hidden state. Each LSTM layer in the RNN will have its own `(c, h)` pair.\n\n2. **Feed the state tuples separately**: When passing the state into the feed dictionary, you'll need to construct the state tuples from separate cell and hidden state values.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n### Constructor\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ncell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMCell(hidden_units)\nrnn_layers = tf.nn.rnn_cell.MultiRNNCell([cell] * layers)\n\n# Create zero state with tuple structure\nself.reset_state = rnn_layers.zero_state(batch_size, dtype=tf.float32)\n\n# Create placeholders for the cell state and hidden state\nself.state = tuple(\n    tf.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMStateTuple(\n        tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, hidden_units], name=f\"c{i}\"),\n        tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, hidden_units], name=f\"h{i}\")\n    ) for i in range(layers)\n)\n\n# RNN outputs and next state\nself.outputs, self.next_state = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(\n    rnn_layers, self.embedded_input, time_major=True, initial_state=self.state\n)\n```\n\n### Training Loop\nIn the training loop, you will need to separate the `state` into its components (cell state `c` and hidden state `h`) for each layer, and then pass them into the feed dictionary.\n\n```python\nfor document in documents:\n    # Initialize state as zero state\n    state = session.run(self.reset_state)\n    for x, y in document:\n        # Create a dictionary to pass the state to the feed dictionary\n        feed_dict = {self.x: x, self.y: y}\n        \n        # Add each layer's state to the feed dictionary\n        for i, (c, h) in enumerate(self.state):\n            feed_dict[c] = state[i].c\n            feed_dict[h] = state[i].h\n\n        # Run the session to train and get the next state\n        _, state = session.run(\n            [self.train_step, self.next_state], \n            feed_dict=feed_dict\n        )\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **State Placeholders**: Placeholders are created for each component (`c` and `h`) of the LSTM state tuple.\n- **Feed Dictionary**: The feed dictionary is constructed by extracting each layer's cell and hidden states from the current state and feeding them accordingly.\n- **Dynamic RNN**: The `tf.nn.dynamic_rnn` function correctly handles the state tuples when `state_is_tuple=True`.\n\nThis approach allows you to manage the LSTM states effectively with `state_is_tuple=True`, ensuring that the state is handled as a tuple of `LSTMStateTuple` objects throughout your RNN operations."
