If the rule determines that the numbers can form a triangle, output \"Yes, they can form a triangle.\" Otherwise, output \"No, they cannot form a triangle.\" Remember that a triangle can only be formed if the sum of the two smallest sides is greater than the largest side."

        "content": "To determine if three numbers can form a triangle, we can use the triangle inequality theorem. This theorem states that for three sides to form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. In simpler terms, for three sides with lengths \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) (where \\(a \\leq b \\leq c\\)), the following conditions must all be true:\n\n1. \\(a + b > c\\)\n2. \\(a + c > b\\)\n3. \\(b + c > a\\)\n\nHowever, if we sort the numbers and ensure \\(a \\leq b \\leq c\\), we only need to check the first condition \\(a + b > c\\), as the other two are always true in this scenario.\n\nLet's apply this rule to three randomly generated numbers. I'll generate three numbers for this example:\n\nSuppose the numbers are 5, 7, and 10.\n\nFirst, sort the numbers: \\(a = 5\\), \\(b = 7\\), \\(c = 10\\).\n\nNow, check the condition: \\(a + b > c\\) which translates to \\(5 + 7 > 10\\).\n\nSince \\(12 > 10\\) is true, the numbers can form a triangle.\n\nTherefore, the output is: \"Yes, they can form a triangle.\""
