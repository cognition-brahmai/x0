I am still getting used to pandas and I believe we should try to avoid for-loops for such operations. How can I achieve this in a 'pandas' way?"

        "content": "Certainly! In pandas, you can perform operations on entire columns or rows without the need for explicit loops, thanks to its vectorized operations. Here's how you can sum across columns 0 to 13 for each row and then divide each cell by the row sum:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming 'df' is your DataFrame\n# Calculate the sum across columns 0 to 13 for each row\nrow_sums = df.iloc[:, 0:14].sum(axis=1)\n\n# Divide each element by the corresponding row sum\n# Use the broadcasting feature of pandas\nnormalized_df = df.iloc[:, 0:14].div(row_sums, axis=0)\n\n# If you want to update the original DataFrame\ndf.iloc[:, 0:14] = normalized_df\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nHere's what the code does:\n- `df.iloc[:, 0:14]`: Selects all rows and columns 0 to 13.\n- `.sum(axis=1)`: Computes the sum across the selected columns for each row.\n- `.div(row_sums, axis=0)`: Divides each cell by the corresponding row sum. The `axis=0` parameter ensures that the division is done row-wise.\n- If you want to update the original DataFrame with the normalized values, you can assign the result back to the relevant slice of the DataFrame.\n\nThis approach efficiently utilizes pandas' capabilities and avoids the need for explicit loops."
