        "content": "The behavior you're encountering with the `str.translate` method in Python 3 is due to the way the method is designed to work. The `translate` method in Python 3 requires a translation table that maps Unicode ordinals (integers) to either Unicode ordinals, strings, or `None`. However, the dictionary you provided, `{'a': 'b'}`, is using characters as keys instead of their Unicode ordinal values.\n\nTo make it work as expected, you need to convert the characters to their Unicode ordinal values using the `ord()` function. Here's how you can achieve the desired translation:\n\n```python\ntranslation_table = {ord('a'): 'b'}\nresult = 'a'.translate(translation_table)\nprint(result)  # This will output 'b'\n```\n\nIn this example, `ord('a')` returns the Unicode ordinal of `'a'`, which is then mapped to `'b'` in the translation table. When you use this table with `str.translate`, it correctly translates `'a'` to `'b'`."
