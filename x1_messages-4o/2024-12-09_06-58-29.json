Here's how you can add a comment in your template:\n\n```Django\n{% comment %}\n    This is a comment.\n{% endcomment %}\n{% if something.property %}\n    <table>\n        <tr>...\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use `{# ... #}` for inline comments:\n\n```Django\n{% if something.property %}\n    {# This is an inline comment #}\n    <table>\n        <tr>...\n```\n\nBoth methods will ensure that the comments are not included in the rendered HTML. Use whichever method fits your needs best."
