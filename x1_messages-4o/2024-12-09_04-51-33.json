I have tried various options but each one has its limitations. \n\nOption 1:\n\n    def myquery():\n        sql = \"select field1, field2, field3, field4 from table where condition1=1 and condition2=2\"\n        con = mymodule.get_connection()\n        ...\n\nThis option is good for printing the SQL string, but it's not a good solution if the string is long and doesn't fit the standard width of 80 characters.\n\nOption 2:\n\n    def query():\n        sql = \"\"\"\n            select field1, field2, field3, field4\n            from table\n            where condition1=1\n            and condition2=2\"\"\"\n        con = mymodule.get_connection()\n        ...\n\nIn this option, the code is clear but when you print the SQL query string, it outputs annoying white spaces.\n\nOption 3:\n\n    def query():\n        sql = \"\"\"select field1, field2, field3, field4\n    from table\n    where condition1=1\n    and condition2=2\"\"\"\n        con = mymodule.get_connection()\n        ...\n\nI don't like this option because it breaks the clearness of the well tabulated code.\n\nOption 4:\n\n    def query():\n        sql = \"select field1, field2, field3, field4 \" \\\n              \"from table \" \\\n              \"where condition1=1 \" \\\n              \"and condition2=2 \"\n        con = mymodule.get_connection()    \n        ...\n\nI don't like this option because of all the extra typing in each line and it's also difficult to edit the query.\n\nFor me, the best solution would be Option 2 but I don't like the extra whitespaces when I print the SQL string. Are there any other options?"

        "content": "Certainly! If you prefer Option 2 for its readability but are concerned about the extra whitespace when printing, you can address this with a few techniques. Let's explore a couple of options that maintain readability and produce clean output:\n\n### Option 5: Using `textwrap.dedent`\nYou can use the `textwrap.dedent` function from the `textwrap` module to remove the leading whitespace from multiline strings:\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef query():\n    sql = textwrap.dedent(\"\"\"\n        SELECT field1, field2, field3, field4\n        FROM table\n        WHERE condition1=1\n        AND condition2=2\n    \"\"\").strip()\n    con = mymodule.get_connection()\n    # Log or print the SQL query\n    print(sql)\n```\n\n- **Advantages**: \n  - Maintains code readability.\n  - Removes leading whitespace.\n\n### Option 6: Using f-strings for Dynamic Queries\nIf your query string needs to incorporate dynamic parameters, you can use f-strings for both clarity and flexibility:\n\n```python\ndef query(field1, field2, field3, field4, table, condition1, condition2):\n    sql = f\"\"\"\n        SELECT {field1}, {field2}, {field3}, {field4}\n        FROM {table}\n        WHERE condition1={condition1}\n        AND condition2={condition2}\n    \"\"\".strip()\n    con = mymodule.get_connection()\n    # Log or print the SQL query\n    print(sql)\n```\n\n- **Advantages**:\n  - Readable and clean.\n  - Flexible for dynamic content.\n  - Removes extra whitespace with `.strip()`.\n\n### Option 7: Using Join for Concatenation\nIf you prefer to build the query string programmatically without dealing with whitespace issues, you can use a list and `join`:\n\n```python\ndef query():\n    sql_parts = [\n        \"SELECT field1, field2, field3, field4\",\n        \"FROM table\",\n        \"WHERE condition1=1\",\n        \"AND condition2=2\"\n    ]\n    sql = \" \".join(sql_parts)\n    con = mymodule.get_connection()\n    # Log or print the SQL query\n    print(sql)\n```\n\n- **Advantages**:\n  - Clean output without extra whitespace.\n  - Easy to modify individual parts of the query.\n\nEach of these options maintains the readability of your SQL query in the source code while ensuring that the printed or logged output is free of unwanted whitespace. Choose the one that best fits your coding style and requirements."
