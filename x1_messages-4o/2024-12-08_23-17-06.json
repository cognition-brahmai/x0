A + C = 60\n\nTo find the total number of birds that A, B, and C have together, let's add all three equations:\n\n(A + B) + (B + C) + (A + C) = 40 + 50 + 60\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2A + 2B + 2C = 150\n\nNow, divide the entire equation by 2:\n\nA + B + C = 75\n\nTherefore, the total number of birds that A, B, and C have together is 75."
