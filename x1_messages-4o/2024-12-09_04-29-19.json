However, I'm encountering an issue where the module 'itertools' doesn't seem to have an attribute 'ifilter'. The specific code section that is causing the error is as follows: \n```python\nreturn itertools.ifilter(lambda i: i.state == \"IS\", self.storage)\n```\nHow can I resolve this issue and successfully run the code in Python 3?"

        "content": "In Python 3, `itertools.ifilter()` was removed and replaced with the built-in `filter()` function. The `filter()` function in Python 3 behaves like `itertools.ifilter()` did in Python 2, returning an iterator instead of a list. \n\nHere's how you can modify your code to work in Python 3:\n\n```python\nreturn filter(lambda i: i.state == \"IS\", self.storage)\n```\n\nThis change should resolve the issue, allowing your code to filter elements based on the condition specified in the lambda function. The `filter()` function will return an iterator over the items in `self.storage` where the lambda condition is `True`."
