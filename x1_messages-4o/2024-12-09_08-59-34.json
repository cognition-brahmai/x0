        "content": "To modify a C# program to calculate the average of two numbers, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Take input** for two numbers from the user.\n2. **Calculate the average** of these numbers.\n3. **Display the result** to the user.\n\nHere's a simple example of how you can implement this:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        // Prompt the user to enter the first number\n        Console.Write(\"Enter the first number: \");\n        double number1 = Convert.ToDouble(Console.ReadLine());\n\n        // Prompt the user to enter the second number\n        Console.Write(\"Enter the second number: \");\n        double number2 = Convert.ToDouble(Console.ReadLine());\n\n        // Calculate the average of the two numbers\n        double average = (number1 + number2) / 2;\n\n        // Display the average to the user\n        Console.WriteLine(\"The average of the two numbers is: \" + average);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Input:** The program prompts the user to enter two numbers, which are read as strings using `Console.ReadLine()` and then converted to `double` using `Convert.ToDouble()`.\n  \n- **Calculation:** The average is calculated by adding the two numbers and dividing the sum by 2.\n\n- **Output:** The result is displayed using `Console.WriteLine()`.\n\nYou can modify this code further based on your requirements, such as adding error handling for invalid inputs or formatting the output to a specific number of decimal places."
