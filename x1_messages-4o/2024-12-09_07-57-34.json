I already have a solution for opening a specific folder using the `subprocess` module, as shown below:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\nsubprocess.Popen('explorer \"C:\\\\path\\\\of\\\\folder\"')\n```\nHowever, I am having trouble finding a similar solution for files. How can I use Python to open a file in the Windows Explorer?"

Here's how you can modify your code to open Windows Explorer and highlight a specific file:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\n# Replace with your file path\nfile_path = \"C:\\\\path\\\\of\\\\folder\\\\file.txt\"\nsubprocess.Popen(f'explorer /select,\"{file_path}\"')\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, the `/select,` option is used with the `explorer` command to open the specified directory and highlight the specific file within Windows Explorer. Just replace `\"C:\\\\path\\\\of\\\\folder\\\\file.txt\"` with the path to your specific file."
