Let's start with the initial prompt: \n\n\"Find the value of x in the equation \\(2x + 5 = 17\\).\"\n\nNow, let's modify the prompt to include the constraint that \\(x\\) must be a prime number:\n\n\"Find the value of \\(x\\) in the equation \\(2x + 5 = 17\\), where \\(x\\) is a prime number.\"\n\nTo find the solution, we'll solve the equation step-by-step:\n\n1. Start with the equation:\n   \\[\n   2x + 5 = 17\n   \\]\n\n2. Subtract 5 from both sides to isolate the term with \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   2x = 17 - 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2x = 12\n   \\]\n\n3.

However, 6 is not a prime number (as it is divisible by 2 and 3).\n\nSince the solution \\(x = 6\\) does not satisfy the constraint that \\(x\\) must be a prime number, there is no solution to the equation \\(2x + 5 = 17\\) where \\(x\\) is a prime number."
