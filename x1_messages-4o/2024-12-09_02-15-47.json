        "content": "The issue you are encountering is likely due to the neural network being unable to generalize beyond the training data effectively. Here are several strategies to improve the performance of your neural network for predicting squares:\n\n1. **Data Normalization**: Neural networks perform better when the input data is normalized. Consider normalizing your input data and labels. For example, scale your inputs and outputs to a range between 0 and 1.\n\n2. **Network Architecture**: The architecture of your neural network might not be suitable for this task. Try experimenting with different numbers of neurons and layers. Sometimes fewer neurons might work better for simpler tasks.\n\n3. **Activation Functions**: Ensure that the activation functions used in the network layers are appropriate. The default activation function might not be suitable for your problem. You could try using different activation functions like ReLU, Tanh, or Sigmoid.\n\n4. **Learning Rate and Training Epochs**: Experiment with different learning rates and the number of training epochs. A learning rate that\u2019s too high might cause the network to converge poorly, while one that\u2019s too low might make training very slow.\n\n5. **Regularization**: Consider using regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, such as dropout or L2 regularization. Overfitting might be causing the network to memorize the training data instead of learning the underlying pattern.\n\n6. **Loss Function**: Ensure that the loss function used is suitable for regression tasks. If you are using a classification loss function, it might not perform well for this task.\n\n7. **Training Data**: Ensure that your training data is comprehensive enough to allow the model to learn the underlying pattern. Consider extending your training dataset.\n\n8. **Use a Different Framework**: The `neurolab` library might have limitations. Consider using more advanced libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, which offer more flexibility and tools for debugging.\n\nHere's an example of how you might adjust your code for normalization and using a different library (TensorFlow):\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\n\n# Load input data\ntext = np.loadtxt('data_sq.txt')\n\n# Separate it into datapoints and labels\ndata = text[:, :1]\nlabels = text[:, 1:]\n\n# Normalize data\nscaler_data = MinMaxScaler()\nscaler_labels = MinMaxScaler()\ndata_scaled = scaler_data.fit_transform(data)\nlabels_scaled = scaler_labels.fit_transform(labels)\n\n# Define a neural network model\nmodel = tf.keras.Sequential([\n    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),\n    tf.keras.layers.Dense(6, activation='relu'),\n    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)\n])\n\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')\n\n# Train the neural network\nmodel.fit(data_scaled, labels_scaled, epochs=2000, verbose=1)\n\n# Run the classifier on test datapoints\nprint('\\nTest results:')\ndata_test = np.array([[100], [101]])\ndata_test_scaled = scaler_data.transform(data_test)\npredictions_scaled = model.predict(data_test_scaled)\npredictions = scaler_labels.inverse_transform(predictions_scaled)\n\nfor i, item in enumerate(data_test):\n    print(item, '-->', predictions[i][0])\n```\n\nThis example uses TensorFlow and includes data normalization, which should help the model learn better. Adjust the model architecture and training parameters as needed to achieve better performance."
