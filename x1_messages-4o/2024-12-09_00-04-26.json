Can you provide me with a code snippet that would allow me to do this seamlessly?\nHere is a sample Swift code that utilizes the Natural Language framework to translate text:\nimport NaturalLanguage\nlet inputText = \"I would like to go to school\"\nlet targetLanguage = \"es\"\nlet translator = NLLanguageRecognizer()\nlet detectedLanguage = translator.dominantLanguage(for: inputText)!.rawValue\nlet options = [NLTranslationOptions.targetLanguage: targetLanguage]\nlet translator = NLTranslator(options: options)\nlet translatedText = translator.translateText(inputText, fromLanguage: detectedLanguage)!\nprint(translatedText)\nYou will need to replace \"es\" with the appropriate language code for the language you want to translate the text to."

        "content": "The Swift code snippet you provided attempts to use the Natural Language framework for translation, but unfortunately, Apple's Natural Language framework doesn't directly support translation. Instead, it focuses on language identification and text classification.\n\nTo achieve translation in Swift, you typically need to use a third-party service, such as Google's Cloud Translation API or Microsoft Translator API. Below is an example of how you can use URLSession to make a network request to a translation API. This example assumes you are using Google Cloud Translation API:\n\nFirstly, you would need to have an API key from the Google Cloud Platform and enable the Cloud Translation API.\n\nHere's a simplified example using Google's Translation API:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\n// Function to perform translation\nfunc translateText(_ text: String, targetLanguage: String, completion: @escaping (String?) -> Void) {\n    let apiKey = \"YOUR_API_KEY\" // Replace with your actual API key\n    let urlStr = \"https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?q=\\(text.addingPercentEncoding(withAllowedCharacters: .urlQueryAllowed) ?? \"\")&target=\\(targetLanguage)&key=\\(apiKey)\"\n\n    guard let url = URL(string: urlStr) else {\n        completion(nil)\n        return\n    }\n\n    let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { data, response, error in\n        guard let data = data, error == nil else {\n            print(\"Error: \\(error?.localizedDescription ?? \"Unknown error\")\")\n            completion(nil)\n            return\n        }\n\n        do {\n            if let json = try JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data, options: []) as? [String: Any],\n               let data = json[\"data\"] as? [String: Any],\n               let translations = data[\"translations\"] as? [[String: Any]],\n               let translatedText = translations.first?[\"translatedText\"] as? String {\n                completion(translatedText)\n            } else {\n                completion(nil)\n            }\n        } catch {\n            print(\"JSON error: \\(error.localizedDescription)\")\n            completion(nil)\n        }\n    }\n\n    task.resume()\n}\n\n// Usage\nlet inputText = \"I would like to go to school\"\nlet targetLanguage = \"es\" // Spanish\n\ntranslateText(inputText, targetLanguage: targetLanguage) { translatedText in\n    if let translatedText = translatedText {\n        print(\"Translated Text: \\(translatedText)\")\n    } else {\n        print(\"Translation failed.\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Important Notes:\n- Replace `\"YOUR_API_KEY\"` with your actual Google Cloud Translation API key.\n- Make sure to handle API keys securely and not expose them in your client-side code.\n- This code uses URLSession to perform an HTTP GET request to the Google Cloud Translation API, which returns the translated text.\n\nThis example is quite basic and does not include error handling or support for multiple simultaneous requests. Depending on your requirements, you might need to expand upon this with better error handling, asynchronous programming practices, or even using a third-party library to manage network requests more effectively."
