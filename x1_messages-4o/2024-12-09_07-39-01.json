        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error messages suggest that CMake is having trouble finding the Python interpreter and libraries. Here's a step-by-step approach to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify Python Installation**:\n   - Ensure that Python is correctly installed on your system. You can verify this by running:\n     ```bash\n     python --version\n     ```\n   - If you have multiple versions of Python installed, use the specific version command like `python2.7` or `python3.x`.\n\n2. **Set Python Executable**:\n   - You need to tell CMake where to find the Python executable. You can do this by setting the `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE` variable in your CMake command or CMakeLists.txt file. You can find the Python executable path with:\n     ```bash\n     which python\n     ```\n   - Use the path obtained from the above command in your CMake command:\n     ```bash\n     cmake -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=/usr/bin/python2.7 ..\n     ```\n\n3. **Correct Include and Library Paths**:\n   - Double-check the paths for `PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIRS` and `PYTHON_LIBRARIES`. Make sure they are set correctly and match the Python version you intend to use.\n\n4. **Update CMake Version**:\n   - Your CMake version seems quite old (2.8). Consider updating CMake to a more recent version, if possible, as newer versions have improved support for finding Python components. You can update CMake using:\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt-get update\n     sudo apt-get install cmake\n     ```\n\n5. **Environment Variables**:\n   - Ensure that the environment variables are exported correctly in the terminal session where you are running CMake. You can export them like this:\n     ```bash\n     export PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIRS=/usr/include/python2.7\n     export PYTHON_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib/python2.7/config/libpython2.7.so\n     ```\n\n6. **Use Python3 if Possible**:\n   - If feasible, consider using Python 3 as it's more up-to-date and better supported. Install Python 3 development packages using:\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt-get install python3-dev\n     ```\n\n7. **Check CMakeLists.txt**:\n   - Ensure that the `CMakeLists.txt` file is correctly set up to find Python. It should have something like:\n     ```cmake\n     find_package(PythonInterp REQUIRED)\n     find_package(PythonLibs REQUIRED)\n     ```\n\n8. **Verify Hostname Resolution**:\n   - The message `sudo: unable to resolve host coderw@ll` indicates a hostname resolution issue. Ensure that your `/etc/hosts` file has the correct entries, such as:\n     ```\n     127.0.0.1 localhost coderwall\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with CMake not finding the Python libraries. If you continue to face problems, consider providing the specific error messages or logs for further assistance."
