        "content": "To find the shortest path in a graph, one of the most commonly used algorithms is Dijkstra's Algorithm. This algorithm is suitable for graphs with non-negative edge weights. It calculates the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in the graph.\n\n### Dijkstra's Algorithm Overview:\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - Set the distance to the starting node to zero and all other nodes to infinity.\n   - Set the starting node as the current node.\n   - Create a priority queue to store nodes based on their current known shortest distance.\n\n2. **Visit Nodes**:\n   - While there are nodes yet to be visited:\n     - Extract the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\n     - For each neighbor of the current node, calculate the potential new shortest distance from the starting node.\n     - If this path is shorter, update the shortest distance for that neighbor.\n     - Add the neighbor to the priority queue for further exploration.\n\n3. **Repeat**: Continue the process until all nodes have been visited and their shortest distances determined.\n\n### Java Code Implementation:\n\nHere's a simple Java implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm using a priority queue:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class Dijkstra {\n\n    static class Edge {\n        int target;\n        int weight;\n\n        Edge(int target, int weight) {\n            this.target = target;\n            this.weight = weight;\n        }\n    }\n\n    static class Graph {\n        int vertices;\n        List<List<Edge>> adjList;\n\n        Graph(int vertices) {\n            this.vertices = vertices;\n            adjList = new ArrayList<>(vertices);\n            for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {\n                adjList.add(new LinkedList<>());\n            }\n        }\n\n        void addEdge(int source, int target, int weight) {\n            adjList.get(source).add(new Edge(target, weight));\n        }\n    }\n\n    public int[] dijkstra(Graph graph, int start) {\n        int[] distances = new int[graph.vertices];\n        Arrays.fill(distances, Integer.MAX_VALUE);\n        distances[start] = 0;\n\n        PriorityQueue<Edge> priorityQueue = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(e -> e.weight));\n        priorityQueue.add(new Edge(start, 0));\n\n        while (!priorityQueue.isEmpty()) {\n            Edge current = priorityQueue.poll();\n            int currentNode = current.target;\n\n            for (Edge edge : graph.adjList.get(currentNode)) {\n                int neighbor = edge.target;\n                int newDist = distances[currentNode] + edge.weight;\n\n                if (newDist < distances[neighbor]) {\n                    distances[neighbor] = newDist;\n                    priorityQueue.add(new Edge(neighbor, newDist));\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        return distances;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Graph graph = new Graph(5);\n        graph.addEdge(0, 1, 10);\n        graph.addEdge(0, 4, 5);\n        graph.addEdge(1, 2, 1);\n        graph.addEdge(4, 1, 3);\n        graph.addEdge(4, 2, 9);\n        graph.addEdge(4, 3, 2);\n        graph.addEdge(3, 2, 4);\n        graph.addEdge(2, 3, 6);\n\n        Dijkstra dijkstra = new Dijkstra();\n        int[] distances = dijkstra.dijkstra(graph, 0);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Shortest distances from node 0:\");\n        for (int i = 0; i < distances.length; i++) {\n            System.out.println(\"To node \" + i + \" : \" + distances[i]);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented as an adjacency list. Each node has a list of edges, where each edge contains the target node and the weight of the edge.\n- **Priority Queue**: Used to efficiently fetch the next node with the smallest tentative distance.\n- **Distance Array**: Keeps track of the shortest known distance from the start node to each node.\n\nThis implementation can be used to find the shortest path in a directed or undirected graph with non-negative weights."
