        "content": "To find the values of \\( w_1 \\), \\( w_2 \\), and \\( w_3 \\) that result in a leadership score of 10, we can use the given function and constraints. The function is:\n\n\\[ \\text{score} = w_1 \\times \\text{marketTrends} + w_2 \\times \\text{culturalInfluences} + w_3 \\]\n\nGiven:\n\n- Market trends = 0.8\n- Cultural influences = 0.9\n- \\( w_3 = 0.3 \\)\n\nSubstitute these into the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{score} = w_1 \\times 0.8 + w_2 \\times 0.9 + 0.3 \\]\n\nWe want the score to be 10:\n\n\\[ 10 = w_1 \\times 0.8 + w_2 \\times 0.9 + 0.3 \\]\n\nSubtract 0.3 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 9.7 = w_1 \\times 0.8 + w_2 \\times 0.9 \\]\n\nNow, we can solve for \\( w_1 \\) and \\( w_2 \\). We know:\n\n- \\( w_1 \\) should be influenced by a weight of 0.4\n- \\( w_2 \\) should be influenced by a weight of 0.3\n\nAssume \\( w_1 = 0.4 \\) and \\( w_2 = 0.3 \\) and substitute them into the equation:\n\n\\[ 9.7 = 0.4 \\times 0.8 + 0.3 \\times 0.9 \\]\n\nCalculate the values:\n\n\\[ 9.7 = 0.32 + 0.27 \\]\n\n\\[ 9.7 = 0.59 \\]\n\nThis does not satisfy the equation, so we need to adjust \\( w_1 \\) and \\( w_2 \\). We can use a system of equations approach, considering the influence of 0.4 and 0.3 as factors for adjusting weights, but the values should satisfy the equation to make the total leadership score equal to 10.\n\nInstead of assuming specific weights, let's solve the equation:\n\n\\[ w_1 \\times 0.8 + w_2 \\times 0.9 = 9.7 \\]\n\nAssume \\( w_1 = a \\) and \\( w_2 = b \\):\n\n- \\( 0.8a + 0.9b = 9.7 \\)\n\nThis is a linear equation, and you can choose values that satisfy it. Let's explore potential solutions:\n\n- Set \\( a = 10 \\), then:\n  \\[ 0.8 \\times 10 + 0.9b = 9.7 \\]\n  \\[ 8 + 0.9b = 9.7 \\]\n  \\[ 0.9b = 1.7 \\]\n  \\[ b = \\frac{1.7}{0.9} \\approx 1.89 \\]\n\nSo a potential solution is \\( w_1 = 10 \\), \\( w_2 \\approx 1.89 \\), and \\( w_3 = 0.3 \\) to achieve a score of 10. However, this combination of weights may need adjustment based on specific conditions you want to impose."
