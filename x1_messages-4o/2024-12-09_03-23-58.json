        "content": "In Python, enumerations (enums) can be created using the `enum` module, which provides a way to define a set of named values. When you return an enum member from a function and want to print its name, you can use the `name` attribute of the enum member. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\nFirst, you need to define an enumeration using the `enum` module. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom enum import Enum\n\nclass MyEnum(Enum):\n    SomeNameA = 1\n    SomeNameB = 2\n    SomeNameC = 3\n\ndef get_enum_value():\n    # Return an enum member\n    return MyEnum.SomeNameA\n\n# Get an enum member from the function\nenum_value = get_enum_value()\n\n# Print the name of the enum member\nprint(f\"{enum_value.__class__.__name__}.{enum_value.name}\")\n```\n\nIn this example, `MyEnum` is an enumeration with three members: `SomeNameA`, `SomeNameB`, and `SomeNameC`. The function `get_enum_value()` returns one of these enum members. When you want to print the name of the enum member, you can use `enum_value.__class__.__name__` to get the name of the enumeration class and `enum_value.name` to get the name of the specific member. The `f-string` is used here to format the output.\n\nRunning the above code will output:\n\n```\nMyEnum.SomeNameA\n```\n\nThis method allows you to print the full name of the enum member in the desired format."
