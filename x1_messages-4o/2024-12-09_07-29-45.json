I run pysmell in the Django directory and move the generated tags to my project directory. I then run pysmell in the project directory as well. However, Vim does not pick up the Django tags and they do not get auto completed. How can I set up autocompletion in Vim so that it will complete the long Django functions like get_object_or_404, as well as classes or functions in my own code?"

        "content": "Setting up autocompletion in Vim for Python and Django can be quite efficient once you configure the right tools. Here\u2019s a general guide on how you can achieve this using various plugins and tools:\n\n1. **Install a Python Autocompletion Plugin:**\n   - **YouCompleteMe (YCM):** This is a powerful autocompletion engine for Vim. It requires compiling and setting up, but offers excellent autocompletion features.\n     - Install it using a plugin manager like Vundle, Pathogen, or Vim-Plug.\n     - Follow the [official installation guide](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe#installation) to compile it with support for Python.\n\n   - **Deoplete and deoplete-jedi:** Another option is using Deoplete, along with its Python autocompletion source, deoplete-jedi.\n     - Install Deoplete and deoplete-jedi using your preferred plugin manager.\n     - Ensure you have Python 3 support in Vim for Deoplete to work.\n\n2. **Configure the Plugin for Django Autocompletion:**\n   - **Jedi-vim:** Install jedi-vim for Python autocompletion. It uses the Jedi autocompletion library, which is great for Python and works well with Django.\n     - You can install it via a plugin manager. After installation, jedi-vim should work out of the box.\n     - It provides features like go-to definition, renaming, and finding references, which can be very useful for Django development.\n\n3. **Set Up Python Environment:**\n   - Ensure that your Python virtual environment is properly configured and activated in Vim. This ensures that the autocompletion engine can access your project's packages, including Django.\n\n4. **Add Django Autocompletion:**\n   - Sometimes the plugins need additional settings for Django. You can add Django-specific paths to your `PYTHONPATH` in your `.vimrc` to ensure that Django modules are recognized.\n   - Example:\n     ```vim\n     let g:ycm_python_interpreter_path = '/path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/python'\n     let g:ycm_python_sys_path = ['/path/to/your/project', '/path/to/your/project/venv/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages']\n     ```\n\n5. **Use Pysmell:**\n   - If you prefer using Pysmell, ensure that the Pysmell-generated `PYSMELLTAGS` file is correctly placed in your project directory.\n   - In your `.vimrc`, include:\n     ```vim\n     let g:pysmell_enable = 1\n     ```\n\n6. **Additional Tools:**\n   - **ALE (Asynchronous Linting Engine):** It provides linting and can also be configured for autocompletion.\n   - **CtrlP or FZF:** These plugins help you quickly navigate through your project files, which can complement your autocompletion setup.\n\n7. **Troubleshooting:**\n   - Make sure you have the latest versions of Vim and the plugins.\n   - Ensure that your project\u2019s dependencies, especially Django, are installed in your virtual environment.\n   - Check for any errors in Vim using `:messages` if something isn\u2019t working as expected.\n\n8. **Update Regularly:**\n   - Keep your plugins updated to ensure compatibility with the latest Django and Python features.\n\nBy setting up these plugins and ensuring your environment is correctly configured, you should be able to achieve efficient autocompletion for Python and Django in Vim."
