        "content": "In Python, the precedence of logical operators is similar to many other programming languages, including C and C++. The order of precedence from highest to lowest for logical operators is as follows:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nThis means that `not` has the highest precedence and will be evaluated first, followed by `and`, and then `or`. However, as with any language, it's always a good practice to use parentheses to make your intentions clear and ensure that your code is readable. For example:\n\n```python\nresult = not A and B or C\n```\n\nThis expression will be evaluated as:\n\n```python\nresult = ((not A) and B) or C\n```\n\nUsing parentheses can help make the code more understandable:\n\n```python\nresult = (not A) and (B or C)\n```\n\nBy structuring your expressions with parentheses, you avoid any potential confusion and ensure that the operations are performed in the order you intend."
