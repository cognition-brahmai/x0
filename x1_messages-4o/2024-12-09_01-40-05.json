        "content": "Relative imports in Python can be tricky, especially when trying to execute a script directly. The error you're encountering, `ValueError: Attempted relative import beyond toplevel package`, typically occurs because relative imports are intended to be used within a package, but when you run a script directly, it's not treated as part of a package.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n### Restructure Your Code to Use Absolute Imports\n\n1. **Use Absolute Imports Instead**: Modify your directory structure to treat it as a package and use absolute imports. This involves adding an `__init__.py` file to your directories to recognize them as packages. Your structure will look like this:\n\n    ```\n    /project_root\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Driver.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 A\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Account.py\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 B\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 Test.py\n    ```\n\n2. **Modify the Import Statement**: In `Test.py`, modify the import statement to use absolute imports. For example:\n\n    ```python\n    from A import Account\n    ```\n\n3. **Run as a Module**: To run your `Driver.py` file, execute it as a module from the project root:\n\n    ```bash\n    python -m Driver\n    ```\n\n### Alternative: Adjust the `sys.path`\n\nIf restructuring isn't an option, you can manually adjust the Python path in `Driver.py` to include the project root directory:\n\n1. **Modify `sys.path`**: Add the project root to `sys.path` at the beginning of your `Driver.py` file:\n\n    ```python\n    import sys\n    import os\n\n    # Append the project root directory to sys.path\n    sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))\n\n    # Now you can perform absolute imports\n    from A import Account\n    ```\n\n### Using a Package Structure with `__init__.py`\n\nBy adding `__init__.py` files, you can explicitly define package boundaries. This is often the preferred approach for larger projects.\n\nRemember to keep in mind that Python's module system is designed to work within a package structure context, and direct script execution may not respect this structure unless explicitly defined as shown above.\n\nThese approaches should help you resolve the issue and correctly import modules from sibling directories."
