I have a 2D matrix similar to this:\n\n```\nt = np.array([[1,2,3,'foo'],\n [2,3,4,'bar'],\n [5,6,7,'hello'],\n [8,9,1,'bar']])\n ```\nI am trying to get the indices where the rows contain the string 'bar'. This is what I have tried with a 1D array:\n\n```\nrows = np.where(t == 'bar')\n```\nThis should give me the indices [0,3] and broadcasting with \n\n```\nresults = t[rows]\n```\nshould give me the right rows. However, I can't figure out how to get the similar result with 2D matrices."

        "content": "To find the indices of rows in a 2D numpy array that contain a specific string, such as `'bar'`, you can use the `numpy.where()` function in combination with boolean indexing. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nt = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 'foo'],\n              [2, 3, 4, 'bar'],\n              [5, 6, 7, 'hello'],\n              [8, 9, 1, 'bar']])\n\n# Use np.where() to find the indices of rows containing 'bar'\nrows_with_bar = np.where(t[:, 3] == 'bar')[0]\n\n# Extract the specific rows\nresults = t[rows_with_bar]\n\nprint(\"Indices of rows containing 'bar':\", rows_with_bar)\nprint(\"Rows containing 'bar':\\n\", results)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Slicing with `t[:, 3]`:** This selects the fourth column of the matrix `t` (since indexing starts at 0). This column contains the strings you are interested in.\n   \n2. **Condition `t[:, 3] == 'bar'`:** This creates a boolean array where each element is `True` if the condition is met and `False` otherwise.\n\n3. **`np.where(condition)[0]`:** This returns the indices of the `True` elements in the boolean array. The `[0]` is used to get the indices, as `np.where` returns a tuple of arrays, one for each dimension.\n\n4. **Indexing `t[rows_with_bar]`:** This uses the indices to extract the rows from the original array `t` that contain the string `'bar'`.\n\nThis will output:\n```\nIndices of rows containing 'bar': [1 3]\nRows containing 'bar':\n [['2' '3' '4' 'bar']\n  ['8' '9' '1' 'bar']]\n```\n\nThis approach effectively filters the rows that contain the string `'bar'` in the specified column."
