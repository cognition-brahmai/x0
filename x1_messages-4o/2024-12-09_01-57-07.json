For example, when I run the following code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.system('ls')\n```\n\nIt lists the files in the current directory and then returns a 0. What does the return value of `os.system()` represent and why does it return 0 in this case?"

        "content": "The return value of the `os.system()` function in Python represents the exit status of the command that was executed. Specifically, it is the return code of the shell command. \n\nIn Unix-like operating systems, a return code of `0` typically indicates that the command was executed successfully without any errors. Non-zero return codes usually indicate that some error occurred during the execution of the command. The exact meaning of non-zero exit codes can vary depending on the command being executed; each command might have its own set of exit codes that signify different types of errors or outcomes.\n\nIn your example:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.system('ls')\n```\n\nThe `ls` command is used to list directory contents. When it completes successfully and lists the files in the current directory without any issues, it exits with a status code of `0`. Therefore, `os.system()` returns `0` to indicate that the command ran successfully."
