        "content": "In Python, when you attempt to use `new_dic[1][2] = 5` on an empty dictionary initialized with `new_dic = {}`, you'll encounter a `KeyError` because the key `1` doesn't exist yet, and you can't assign a value to a non-existent nested dictionary.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can use the `collections.defaultdict` class, which allows you to specify a default type for the dictionary values. Here's how you can create a two-dimensional dictionary using `defaultdict`:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\n# Create a two-dimensional dictionary\nnew_dic = defaultdict(dict)\n\n# Now you can insert values without encountering a KeyError\nnew_dic[1][2] = 5\n\n# Access the value to check if it was inserted correctly\nprint(new_dic[1][2])  # Output: 5\n```\n\nThe `defaultdict(dict)` creates a dictionary that automatically creates a new dictionary for any key that doesn't already exist. This way, you can directly assign values to nested keys without having to check if the intermediate keys exist. \n\nAlternatively, you can manually check and initialize each key before assigning values if you prefer not to use `defaultdict`:\n\n```python\n# Create a standard dictionary\nnew_dic = {}\n\n# Check and initialize the first level key if it doesn't exist\nif 1 not in new_dic:\n    new_dic[1] = {}\n\n# Now you can safely assign the value\nnew_dic[1][2] = 5\n\n# Access the value to check if it was inserted correctly\nprint(new_dic[1][2])  # Output: 5\n```\n\nBoth methods will allow you to work with two-dimensional dictionaries effectively in Python."
