However, I am encountering a problem where the server seems to cache the files. As a result, old versions of files are served despite newer ones being available. Is there a way to specify the \"no cache\" option directly from the command line?"

        "content": "The behavior you're experiencing with caching is likely due to the client's browser caching the files, rather than the Python SimpleHTTPServer itself, as it doesn't inherently cache files. SimpleHTTPServer is quite basic and doesn't have built-in options to control HTTP headers directly from the command line.\n\nHowever, you can apply a workaround by modifying the server code to include no-cache headers. Here's how you can do this:\n\n1. Create a custom Python script to run your HTTP server with caching headers disabled. You can use the `http.server` module in Python 3 or `SimpleHTTPServer` in Python 2.\n\nFor Python 3, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\nimport http.server\nimport socketserver\n\nPORT = 8888\n\nclass NoCacheRequestHandler(http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):\n    def end_headers(self):\n        # Set headers to disable caching\n        self.send_header(\"Cache-Control\", \"no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0\")\n        self.send_header(\"Pragma\", \"no-cache\")\n        self.send_header(\"Expires\", \"0\")\n        super().end_headers()\n\nHandler = NoCacheRequestHandler\n\nwith socketserver.TCPServer((\"\", PORT), Handler) as httpd:\n    print(f\"Serving at port {PORT}\")\n    httpd.serve_forever()\n```\n\nFor Python 2, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\nimport SimpleHTTPServer\nimport SocketServer\n\nPORT = 8888\n\nclass NoCacheRequestHandler(SimpleHTTPServer.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):\n    def end_headers(self):\n        # Set headers to disable caching\n        self.send_header(\"Cache-Control\", \"no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0\")\n        self.send_header(\"Pragma\", \"no-cache\")\n        self.send_header(\"Expires\", \"0\")\n        SimpleHTTPServer.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler.end_headers(self)\n\nHandler = NoCacheRequestHandler\n\nhttpd = SocketServer.TCPServer((\"\", PORT), Handler)\n\nprint(f\"Serving at port {PORT}\")\nhttpd.serve_forever()\n```\n\n2. Save the script as `no_cache_server.py` or any name you prefer.\n\n3. Run the script using the command:\n\n   ```bash\n   python no_cache_server.py\n   ```\n\nThis will start a simple HTTP server on port 8888 with caching disabled, ensuring that you always get the most recent versions of your files."
