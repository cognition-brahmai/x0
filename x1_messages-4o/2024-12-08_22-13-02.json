INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY**\n\n*The room is dimly lit. A single bulb hangs overhead, casting shadows on the walls. A POLICE OFFICER, stern and composed, sits across the table from the SUSPECT, who appears anxious and fidgety.*\n\n**POLICE OFFICER**  \n(leaning forward)  \nAlright, let's go over this one more time. Where were you on the night of the 15th?\n\n**SUSPECT**  \n(nervously)  \nI told you, I was at home. I didn't go anywhere.\n\n**POLICE OFFICER**  \n(firmly)  \nWe've got witnesses who saw you near the scene. You want to explain that?\n\n**SUSPECT**  \n(shaking head)  \nThey're lying. I swear, I wasn't there.\n\n**POLICE OFFICER**  \n(skeptical)  \nYou expect me to believe that? You have a reputation, you know.\n\n**SUSPECT**  \n(defensive)  \nPeople talk, Officer. Doesn't mean it's true.\n\n**POLICE OFFICER**  \n(leaning back)  \nAlright, let's say I believe you. Can anyone vouch for your whereabouts?\n\n**SUSPECT**  \n(pauses, hesitates)  \nMy sister. She was with me all night.\n\n**POLICE OFFICER**  \n(noting)  \nWe'll check with her. But remember, if you're lying, it's only going to get worse.\n\n**SUSPECT**  \n(pleading)  \nI'm not lying. Please, you have to believe me.\n\n**POLICE OFFICER**  \n(calmer)  \nWe'll see about that. For now, just stay put. We'll be back.\n\n*The officer stands up, giving the suspect one last scrutinizing look before exiting the room. The suspect sits back, exhaling deeply, tension still palpable.*\n\n**FADE OUT.**\n\n--- \n\n*Note: This is a fictional scenario and any resemblance to actual events or persons is purely coincidental.*"
