I'm not sure what I'm missing or how to solve this. Here's my code:\n\n```python\nimport dateutil.parser\nimport datetime\n\nmy_date = datetime.datetime(2000, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 000000, tzinfo=tzutc())\n\nprint(my_date)\n```\n\nAnd here's the error I'm getting:\n\n```python\nNameError: name 'tzutc' is not defined\n```\n\nHow can I correctly use the tzutc() function to make this code work?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the `tzutc` function not being imported. The `tzutc` function is part of the `dateutil` library's `tz` module. To resolve the `NameError`, you need to import `tzutc` from the `dateutil.tz` module.\n\nHere's how you can update your code to fix the issue:\n\n```python\nimport dateutil.parser\nimport datetime\nfrom dateutil.tz import tzutc\n\nmy_date = datetime.datetime(2000, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 000000, tzinfo=tzutc())\n\nprint(my_date)\n```\n\nWith this change, the `tzutc` function is properly imported, and your code should work as expected. The `tzutc` function provides a timezone object for UTC, which you can use as the `tzinfo` parameter in your `datetime` object."
