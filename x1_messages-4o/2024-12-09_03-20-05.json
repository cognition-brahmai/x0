However, due to Python's sensitivity to whitespace, the copied code does not function as intended, likely because indentation gets messed up. I am looking for an efficient way to copy and paste code into the Python interpreter. For example, consider this class definition that I'd like to copy without having to manually adjust the indentation or type out everything:\n\n```python\nclass bcolors: \n    HEADER = '\\033[95m' \n    OKBLUE = '\\033[94m' \n    OKGREEN = '\\033[92m' \n    WARNING = '\\033[93m' \n    FAIL = '\\033[91m' \n    ENDC = '\\033[0m' \n\n    def disable(self):  \n        self.HEADER = '' \n        self.OKBLUE = '' \n        self.OKGREEN = '' \n        self.WARNING = '' \n        self.FAIL = '' \n        self.ENDC = ''\n```"

        "content": "Copying and pasting code into a Python interpreter can indeed be tricky due to the sensitivity of indentation. Here are a few ways you can efficiently handle this issue:\n\n1. **Use an IDE or Text Editor**: Many Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) or text editors (such as PyCharm, VSCode, or Sublime Text) correctly maintain indentation when copying and pasting code due to their support for Python.\n\n2. **Use an Online Python Interpreter**: Some online Python interpreters or Jupyter Notebooks handle indentation better when pasting code. These platforms often provide a more forgiving environment for copying and pasting code.\n\n3. **Use Triple-Quoted Strings**: If you need to paste code into an interactive Python session, you can wrap your code block in triple-quoted strings. This allows you to paste the entire block at once and execute it with the `exec()` function.\n\n   ```python\n   code = \"\"\"\n   class bcolors: \n       HEADER = '\\\\033[95m' \n       OKBLUE = '\\\\033[94m' \n       OKGREEN = '\\\\033[92m' \n       WARNING = '\\\\033[93m' \n       FAIL = '\\\\033[91m' \n       ENDC = '\\\\033[0m' \n\n       def disable(self):  \n           self.HEADER = '' \n           self.OKBLUE = '' \n           self.OKGREEN = '' \n           self.WARNING = '' \n           self.FAIL = '' \n           self.ENDC = ''\n   \"\"\"\n\n   exec(code)\n   ```\n\n4. **Use a Python Script File**: If you often need to run complex code, consider saving your code in a `.py` file and running it. This way, you can maintain proper formatting and avoid any indentation issues. You can use the `execfile()` function in Python 2 or `exec(open(\"file.py\").read())` in Python 3 to execute the file contents in an interpreter session.\n\n5. **Copy-Paste Carefully**: If you must use a simple text editor, ensure that your text editor's tab settings are consistent with Python's requirements (usually 4 spaces per tab). When pasting, check that your indentation levels are preserved correctly.\n\nBy employing these methods, you should be able to copy and paste Python code into an interpreter without encountering indentation issues."
