When I print the value of 'test' using square bracket notation, it's working perfectly. However, I wish to use dot notation to get the value. I attempted to achieve this by overriding the '__getattr__' method in my class. This seems to work when I try to get the value using dot notation, but when I try to print 'test' alone, I receive an error saying \"Sorry no key matches\". Why is this happening?"

        "content": "In Python, the dot notation is typically used for accessing attributes of objects, not for dictionary keys. When you use dot notation, Python looks for an attribute with the specified name rather than a dictionary key. However, you can achieve similar functionality by creating a custom class that overrides the `__getattr__` method to allow access to dictionary keys using dot notation.\n\nThe issue you're experiencing stems from how `__getattr__` works. The `__getattr__` method is only called when the attribute being accessed isn't found in the usual places (i.e., as an instance attribute or in the class). If you try to access an attribute that doesn\u2019t exist, `__getattr__` will be invoked, and since the dictionary doesn't have an attribute by that name, it ends up calling your custom error message.\n\nHere's a sample implementation to make your dictionary support dot notation:\n\n```python\nclass DotDict:\n    def __init__(self, dictionary):\n        self._dict = dictionary\n\n    def __getattr__(self, item):\n        try:\n            return self._dict[item]\n        except KeyError:\n            raise AttributeError(f\"Sorry no key matches: {item}\")\n\n    def __getitem__(self, item):\n        return self._dict[item]\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return repr(self._dict)\n\n# Usage\ntest = DotDict({'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'})\n\nprint(test.key1)  # Access using dot notation\nprint(test['key2'])  # Access using square bracket notation\nprint(test)  # Print the dictionary\n```\n\nIn this code, `DotDict` wraps a dictionary and overrides `__getattr__` to look up keys using dot notation. The `__getitem__` method is also defined to allow standard dictionary access using square brackets. The `__repr__` method is overridden to provide a string representation of the dictionary when you print the object. This should solve the error you were encountering when trying to print the dictionary."
