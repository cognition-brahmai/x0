Here's how you can achieve this using only the day, month, and year:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Define the date\nyear = 2023\nmonth = 10\nday = 25\n\n# Create a datetime object for midnight of the given date\ndate_object = datetime(year, month, day)\n\n# Get the UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch)\ntimestamp = int(date_object.timestamp())\n\nprint(\"UNIX timestamp at midnight:\", timestamp)\n```\n\nThis code snippet creates a `datetime` object for the specified date with the time set to midnight (hour, minute, and second all zero). The `timestamp()` method then converts this `datetime` object into a UNIX timestamp, representing the number of seconds since the epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC)."
