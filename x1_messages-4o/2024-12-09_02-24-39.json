        "content": "The purpose of the `finally` clause in Python's `try/except/finally` statements is to ensure that a block of code is executed no matter what happens in the `try` block. This includes whether an exception was raised and caught or not, and even if an exception was raised that wasn't caught by an `except` block. The `finally` block is typically used for cleanup actions, such as closing files, releasing resources, or other necessary clean-up tasks.\n\nIn the code examples you provided, there is a subtle but important difference between the two:\n\n1. **Without `finally`:**\n\n   ```python\n   try:\n       run_code1()\n   except TypeError:\n       run_code2()\n   other_code()\n   ```\n\n   In this setup, `other_code()` will only be executed if `run_code1()` does not raise a `TypeError` or if a `TypeError` is raised and caught by the `except` block. If any other exception is raised and not handled, `other_code()` will not be executed.\n\n2. **With `finally`:**\n\n   ```python\n   try:\n       run_code1()\n   except TypeError:\n       run_code2()\n   finally:\n       other_code()\n   ```\n\n   In this setup, `other_code()` will be executed regardless of whether an exception is raised or not, and regardless of whether the exception was caught. This ensures that `other_code()` runs every time the `try` block is executed, making it a reliable place for cleanup operations.\n\nSo, the key thing you're overlooking is that the `finally` block guarantees execution of the code within it, irrespective of whether exceptions occur or not. If you need `other_code()` to always run, regardless of exceptions, you should use the `finally` block."
