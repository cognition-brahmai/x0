You can verify it by running:\n\n     ```bash\n     python --version\n     ```\n\n   - If it points to the original system Python, then you're all set.\n\nIf you still encounter issues or if the `conda` command is still available, double-check any other shell configuration files such as `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` for leftover Anaconda configurations and paths, and remove them accordingly."
