I used to receive logs from my Python Cloud Functions in the Google Cloud Console within the logging dashboard, but recently, it just stopped working. Even when I created a simple \"hello world\" function with different logging levels, it seems like something that was parsing the Python built-in log records into Stackdriver has stopped parsing the log severity parameter. I've also noticed that all of the Python logs are now under the \"Default\" filter. What could be causing these issues and how can I solve them?\n\nHere's the simple function I created:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\ndef cf_endpoint(req):\n    logging.debug('log debug')\n    logging.info('log info')\n    logging.warning('log warning')\n    logging.error('log error')\n    logging.critical('log critical')\n    return 'ok'\n```"

        "content": "It sounds like there might be a couple of issues contributing to your logging problem with Google Cloud Functions. Here are some steps and considerations to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Log Configuration:**\n   Ensure that the logging configuration in your Python function is set to capture the desired log levels. By default, the root logger may not be configured to capture all log levels. You can explicitly set the logging level at the start of your function:\n\n   ```python\n   import logging\n\n   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\n\n   def cf_endpoint(req):\n       logging.debug('log debug')\n       logging.info('log info')\n       logging.warning('log warning')\n       logging.error('log error')\n       logging.critical('log critical')\n       return 'ok'\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify IAM Permissions:**\n   Ensure that the service account associated with your Cloud Function has the necessary permissions to write logs to Stackdriver (now Google Cloud Logging). The role `roles/logging.logWriter` should be assigned to the service account.\n\n3. **Check Logging Dashboard Filters:**\n   In the Google Cloud Console, make sure there are no filters applied in the Logging dashboard that might be hiding the logs. Check the time range and any other filters that might limit the visibility of your logs.\n\n4. **Review Cloud Function Configuration:**\n   Double-check the configuration of your Cloud Function to ensure there are no recent changes that might affect logging, such as changes to the runtime or environment variables.\n\n5. **Inspect the Logs Format:**\n   Sometimes, changes in how logs are structured or parsed might cause issues. Verify if the logs are appearing under a different label or severity. You can use the advanced filters in the Logging dashboard to search for your logs based on their content rather than severity.\n\n6. **Update Google Cloud SDK:**\n   Ensure that you are using the latest version of the Google Cloud SDK and have updated any dependencies or libraries related to Google Cloud in your development environment.\n\n7. **Check for Recent Changes or Incidents:**\n   There might have been changes or incidents with Google Cloud Logging that could cause temporary issues. Check the Google Cloud Status Dashboard for any ongoing issues or recent changes.\n\nIf none of these suggestions solve your problem, consider creating a minimal reproducible example and reaching out to Google Cloud Support with detailed information about your setup, including any recent changes that might have coincided with the logging issues."
