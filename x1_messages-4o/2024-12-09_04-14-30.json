As per my understanding from the http://docs.scipy.org manual, both these functions are related to the Gaussian distribution. However, I am curious to know if there are any subtle differences between `randn` and `normal` that I might need to be aware of? In what scenarios would it be more beneficial to use one function over the other?"

        "content": "Yes, both `randn` and `normal` functions in the `numpy.random` module are related to Gaussian (normal) distributions, but there are some differences in their usage and functionality that you should be aware of.\n\n### `randn` Function\n\n- **Purpose**: `randn` is used to generate samples from a standard normal distribution, which has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n- **Usage**: It is typically used when you want to quickly generate samples from a standard normal distribution without specifying the mean and standard deviation.\n- **Syntax**: `numpy.random.randn(d0, d1, ..., dn)`\n- **Dimensions**: The arguments specify the dimensions of the returned array. For example, `numpy.random.randn(3, 2)` will generate a 3x2 matrix of samples from the standard normal distribution.\n\n### `normal` Function\n\n- **Purpose**: `normal` is more flexible and allows you to specify the mean and standard deviation of the distribution you want to sample from.\n- **Usage**: It is beneficial when you need to generate samples from a normal distribution with specific mean and standard deviation values.\n- **Syntax**: `numpy.random.normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=None)`\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `loc`: The mean of the distribution (default is 0).\n  - `scale`: The standard deviation of the distribution (default is 1).\n  - `size`: The shape of the output array. If `None`, a single value is returned.\n  \n### When to Use Each\n\n- **Use `randn`**: When you need samples from a standard normal distribution and want to keep your code concise and straightforward.\n- **Use `normal`**: When you need more control over the distribution parameters, such as specifying a different mean or standard deviation.\n\nIn summary, choose `randn` for simplicity and speed when working with the standard normal distribution, and opt for `normal` when you need flexibility in defining the distribution's parameters."
