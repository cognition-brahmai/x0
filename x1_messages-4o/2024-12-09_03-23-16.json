For example, I have 600 values, 50% of which are zero, and the rest are between 1 and 100. I want to categorize all the zero values in fractile 1, and then the rest of the non-zero values in fractile labels 2 to 10 (assuming I want 10 fractiles). Is there a way to convert the zeroes to nan, qcut the remaining non-nan data into 9 fractiles (1 to 9), then add 1 to each label (now 2 to 10) and label all the zero values as fractile 1 manually? I also have a few hundred values which may already be nan before I would convert the zeroes to nan. I have tried an interim solution (provided below), but it doesn't work properly if the high frequency value is not on the edges of the distribution.\n\n```python\ndef fractile_cut(ser, num_fractiles):\n    num_valid = ser.valid().shape[0]\n    remain_fractiles = num_fractiles\n    vcounts = ser.value_counts()\n    high_freq = []\n    i = 0\n    while vcounts.iloc[i] > num_valid/ float(remain_fractiles):\n        curr_val = vcounts.index[i]\n        high_freq.append(curr_val)\n        remain_fractiles -= 1\n        num_valid = num_valid - vcounts[i]\n        i += 1\n    curr_ser = ser.copy()\n    curr_ser = curr_ser[~curr_ser.isin(high_freq)]\n    qcut = pd.qcut(curr_ser, remain_fractiles, retbins=True)\n    qcut_bins = qcut[1]\n    all_bins = list(qcut_bins)\n    for val in high_freq:\n        bisect.insort(all_bins, val)\n    cut = pd.cut(ser, bins=all_bins)\n    ser_fractiles = pd.Series(cut.labels + 1, index=ser.index)\n    return ser_fractiles\n```"

        "content": "To address the issue of non-unique bin edges and to ensure that all zero values are placed in the first fractile, you can follow a more structured approach. The idea is to handle zeros separately and then apply `qcut` to the non-zero values. After that, you combine the results. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Convert zeros to NaN temporarily.\n2. Use `qcut` to divide non-zero values into the desired number of fractiles minus one.\n3. Adjust the bins obtained from `qcut` to account for the missing zero fractile.\n4. Combine the results by assigning zero values to the first fractile manually.\n\nHere's an updated version of your function:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef fractile_cut(ser, num_fractiles):\n    # Step 1: Convert zeros to NaN temporarily\n    ser_mod = ser.replace(0, np.nan)\n    \n    # Step 2: Apply qcut on non-zero values\n    non_zero_fractiles = num_fractiles - 1\n    qcut_result, bins = pd.qcut(ser_mod.dropna(), non_zero_fractiles, retbins=True, labels=False, duplicates='drop')\n    \n    # Step 3: Adjust the qcut labels to start from 2\n    qcut_result = qcut_result + 2\n    \n    # Create a full series with the same index\n    full_series = pd.Series(index=ser.index, dtype=float)\n    \n    # Fill in with qcut results\n    full_series.loc[qcut_result.index] = qcut_result\n    \n    # Step 4: Assign zero values to fractile 1\n    full_series.loc[ser == 0] = 1\n    \n    # Handle existing NaN values separately if needed\n    # (in this case, they will remain NaN in the final series)\n    \n    return full_series\n\n# Example usage:\ndata = pd.Series([0] * 300 + list(np.random.randint(1, 101, 300)))\nresult = fractile_cut(data, 10)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Convert Zeros to NaN**: This ensures that zero values don't interfere with the `qcut` binning process.\n- **Apply qcut**: We apply `qcut` to the non-zero values, specifying `duplicates='drop'` to handle any potential overlap in bin edges.\n- **Adjust qcut Labels**: Increment the labels by 2 to ensure they start from 2.\n- **Combine Results**: Assign zero values to the first fractile (label 1) manually, and ensure that the final series maintains the original index of the input series.\n\nThis approach ensures that all zero values are captured in the first fractile, and the non-zero values are distributed across the remaining fractiles."
