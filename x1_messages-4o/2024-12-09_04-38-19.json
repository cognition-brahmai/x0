My Python version is 3.7.1 and the code for my test case is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\nclass MyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):\n\ndef test_dummy(self):\n    self.assertEqual(2+2,4)\n```\n\nI am running my test using the command `python -m unittest tests\\test_file.py` in cmd. The file structure of my project is as follows:\n\n```\nMWE -|\n      |_tests - |\n                |_test_file.py\n```\n\nThe expected outcome is for the test to execute successfully. However, I am getting the following error:\n\n```\nstrclass\nERROR: test_file (unittest.loader._FailedTest)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nImportError: Failed to import test module: test_file\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"C:\\Users\\yadada\\AppData\\Local\\Continuum\\anaconda3\\lib\\unittest\\loader.py\", line 156, in loadTestsFromName\n    module = __import__(module_name)\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tests.test_file'\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nRan 1 test in 0.001s\n```\n\nWhat could be causing this issue and how can I fix it?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is typically related to Python not being able to locate the `test_file` module. This can happen due to several reasons, such as incorrect paths or issues with the `__init__.py` files. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check the Import Path**: Ensure that your current working directory is set to the root of your project (`MWE`) when you run the command. If you are in a different directory, Python might not be able to find the `tests` package.\n\n2. **Add `__init__.py`**: Although not strictly necessary for Python 3.3 and later, adding an empty `__init__.py` file in your `tests` directory can help Python recognize it as a package. This can help with import issues.\n\n3. **Correct Indentation**: In your test case, ensure that the method `test_dummy` is properly indented. It should be indented under the class definition:\n\n    ```python\n    import unittest\n\n    class MyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):\n\n        def test_dummy(self):\n            self.assertEqual(2 + 2, 4)\n    ```\n\n4. **Execute from Project Root**: When you run the command, make sure you do it from the root directory of your project (i.e., the same level as the `tests` directory):\n\n    ```bash\n    python -m unittest tests.test_file\n    ```\n\n5. **Check Python Environment**: Ensure that you are using the correct Python environment where your project dependencies and modules are set up.\n\nAfter making these changes, try running your test again. If the issue persists, double-check the directory structure and ensure that there are no typos or misplaced files."
