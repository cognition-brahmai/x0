For instance, if my input dictionary is:\n```python\na = dict()\na['one'] = 1\na['two'] = 2\n```\nI want the output to be:\n```python\n{1: 'one', 2: 'two'}\n```\nThis should be the equivalent of:\n```python\nres = dict()\nres[1] = 'one'\nres[2] = 'two'\n```\nIs there a Pythonic way to accomplish this?"

        "content": "Yes, you can easily swap the keys and values in a Python dictionary using a dictionary comprehension. Since the values in your dictionary are unique, this process will work without any issues. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\na = {'one': 1, 'two': 2}\n\n# Swapping keys and values\nswapped = {value: key for key, value in a.items()}\n\nprint(swapped)\n```\n\nThe output will be:\n\n```python\n{1: 'one', 2: 'two'}\n```\n\nIn this code, we use a dictionary comprehension to iterate over the items of the original dictionary `a`. For each key-value pair, we create a new key-value pair in the `swapped` dictionary with the value as the key and the key as the value. This approach is both concise and efficient."
