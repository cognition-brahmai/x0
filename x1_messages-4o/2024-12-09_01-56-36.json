        "content": "To implement a \"keep alive\" HTTP request using Python's `urllib2` library, you need to ensure that the `Connection: keep-alive` header is included in your requests. This header tells the server that you want to keep the connection open for further requests, rather than closing it immediately after a single request/response cycle.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you can achieve this in Python 2 using `urllib2`:\n\n```python\nimport urllib2\n\nclass KeepAliveHandler(urllib2.BaseHandler):\n    def http_request(self, req):\n        req.add_header('Connection', 'keep-alive')\n        return req\n\n    https_request = http_request\n\n# Create an opener with the KeepAliveHandler\nopener = urllib2.build_opener(KeepAliveHandler)\n\n# Use the opener to make a request\nurl = 'http://example.com'\nrequest = urllib2.Request(url)\nresponse = opener.open(request)\n\n# Read and print the response\nprint(response.read())\n\n# You can reuse the opener to make more requests, which will use the same connection\n# if the server supports keep-alive.\nrequest2 = urllib2.Request(url)\nresponse2 = opener.open(request2)\nprint(response2.read())\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **KeepAliveHandler:** This custom handler adds the `Connection: keep-alive` header to every HTTP request.\n2. **Opener:** `urllib2.build_opener(KeepAliveHandler)` creates an opener object that uses the `KeepAliveHandler`.\n3. **Reusability:** By using the same opener for multiple requests, you can keep the connection alive for supported servers.\n\nRemember that `urllib2` is specific to Python 2. If you're using Python 3, you would typically use `urllib.request` instead, or more commonly, the `requests` library, which handles keep-alive connections automatically. If you're able to use Python 3, I would recommend switching to `requests` for more modern and easier HTTP handling."
