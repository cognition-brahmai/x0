        "content": "To resolve the issue of not having `pip3` available on your Windows machine, even though you have Python 3.x installed, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Python Installation**:\n   Ensure that Python 3.5.2 or Python 3.6 is installed correctly. Open a command prompt and run:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 --version\n   ```\n\n   or\n   \n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   ```\n\n   If you see the correct version of Python 3.x, proceed with the following steps.\n\n2. **Download get-pip.py**:\n   If `pip3` is not installed by default, you can install it manually using the `get-pip.py` script. Download it using your web browser from the official source: [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py).\n\n3. **Install pip3 using get-pip.py**:\n   Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where `get-pip.py` is downloaded. Run the following command to install `pip` for Python 3.x:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 get-pip.py\n   ```\n\n   or if your command prompt recognizes `python` as Python 3.x:\n\n   ```bash\n   python get-pip.py\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify pip3 Installation**:\n   After the installation, verify that `pip3` is installed by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip3 --version\n   ```\n\n   This should display the version of `pip3` installed.\n\n5. **Add Python and Pip to PATH**:\n   Make sure your Python installation and `Scripts` directory are in your system's PATH environment variable. You can do this by:\n   \n   - Right-click on 'This PC' or 'My Computer' and go to 'Properties'.\n   - Click on 'Advanced system settings'.\n   - Click on 'Environment Variables'.\n   - Under 'System variables', find the 'Path' variable, select it, and click 'Edit'.\n   - Add the paths where Python and `pip` are installed, typically something like `C:\\Python36\\` and `C:\\Python36\\Scripts\\`.\n\n6. **Restart Command Prompt**:\n   Close and reopen your command prompt to ensure the PATH changes take effect.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to get `pip3` installed and working on your Windows machine. If you encounter any errors, make sure you have the necessary permissions to install software on your machine or try running the command prompt as an administrator."
