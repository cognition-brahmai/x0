In the context of merging two dictionaries into a third one using the aforementioned expression, I'm unclear on the role of the `**` operator. While I'm familiar with `**` as the power operator in Python, I have not encountered this usage before in my experience. Here's the full snippet of code for reference:\n\n```python\nd1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\nd2 = {'c': 3, 'd': 4}\nd3 = dict(d1, **d2)\nprint(d3)\n```\n\nThe output of the print statement is `{'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'b': 2, 'd': 4}`. Can you explain what the `**` operator is doing in this context?"

        "content": "In the context of the expression `dict(d1, **d2)`, the `**` operator is being used for unpacking the dictionary `d2` into keyword arguments for the `dict()` constructor.\n\nHere's what happens in this expression:\n\n1. **Unpacking with `**`:** In Python, the `**` operator is used to unpack dictionaries. When you use `**d2`, it unpacks the key-value pairs in `d2` and passes them as keyword arguments to the function it is called in. So, `**d2` essentially turns the dictionary `d2` into `c=3, d=4` in the context of the function call.\n\n2. **Merging dictionaries:** The `dict()` constructor can accept keyword arguments in addition to a dictionary. When you call `dict(d1, **d2)`, you are creating a new dictionary. It starts with the contents of `d1`, and then the unpacked key-value pairs from `d2` are added or updated into it. If there were any overlapping keys, the values from `d2` would override those from `d1`.\n\n3. **Order of keys:** The order of keys in the resulting dictionary `d3` (`{'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'b': 2, 'd': 4}`) reflects how the keys are added during the construction of the dictionary. Starting with `d1`, keys from `d2` are added subsequently.\n\nThus, `dict(d1, **d2)` effectively merges the two dictionaries `d1` and `d2` into a new dictionary `d3`, with `d2`'s entries being added to or updating `d1`'s in `d3`. This is a common Python idiom for merging dictionaries when you want to create an entirely new dictionary without modifying the originals."
