I understand that the range() function, which is actually an object type in Python 3, generates its contents dynamically, similar to a generator. Considering this, I would have expected the operation to take a significant amount of time as it would have to generate a quadrillion values to determine whether 1 quadrillion is in the range. But, it seems no matter how many zeros I add, the computation more or less takes the same amount of time (almost instant). I have also tried variations but the computation is still almost immediate. When I attempt to implement my own range function, the result is not as efficient. Could you explain what the range() object does internally to make it so fast?"

        "content": "The reason the operation `\"1000000000000000 in range(1000000000000001)\"` is so fast in Python 3 is due to the efficient implementation of the `range` object. Here's what happens internally:\n\n1. **Range Object**: In Python 3, `range` does not generate a list of numbers. Instead, it creates a `range` object that represents the sequence. This object uses start, stop, and step values to define the sequence without actually generating all the numbers at once.\n\n2. **Membership Testing**: When you perform a membership test with `in`, Python does not iterate over each element in the range. Instead, it uses mathematical calculations to determine if a number is within the specified range. \n\n3. **Mathematical Check**: For a range defined as `range(start, stop, step)`, to check if a number `n` is in the range, Python performs a quick calculation:\n   - First, it checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `start` and less than `stop`.\n   - Then, it checks if `(n - start) % step == 0`. This determines if `n` aligns with the step from the starting point.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: These mathematical operations are highly efficient, operating in constant time, O(1), regardless of the size of the range. This is why the operation is almost instantaneous, even for very large numbers.\n\nYour own implementation might not be as efficient if it generates elements or checks each one individually, which would take linear time, O(n), relative to the size of the range. The built-in `range` object, on the other hand, leverages its arithmetic-based approach to membership testing, bypassing the need to explicitly generate all numbers."
