        "content": "To import a Python script from a sibling directory, you can modify the Python path at runtime within your script. This can be done using the `sys` module to add the parent directory to the system path, allowing you to import the sibling module directly. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Modify `foo.py` to Include the Parent Directory in the Path:**\n\n   You\u2019ll first need to import the `sys` and `os` modules and then append the parent directory to the `sys.path`. Once that's done, you can import `bar` from `bar_dir`.\n\n   Here\u2019s an example of how `foo.py` could be structured:\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   import os\n\n   # Get the parent directory\n   parent_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))\n\n   # Add the parent directory to the sys.path\n   sys.path.append(os.path.join(parent_dir, '..', 'bar_dir'))\n\n   # Now you can import bar\n   import bar\n\n   # Use functions or classes from bar.py\n   bar.some_function()\n   ```\n\n2. **Alternative Approach Using a Package:**\n\n   If you want a cleaner approach and you have control over the directory structure, you might consider converting your directories into packages. This involves adding an `__init__.py` file to each directory you want to treat as a package. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n   - Create an empty `__init__.py` file in both `foo_dir` and `bar_dir`.\n\n   - Modify the import statement in `foo.py`:\n\n     ```python\n     from bar_dir import bar\n\n     # Call functions from bar\n     bar.some_function()\n     ```\n\n3. **Using Relative Imports:**\n\n   If both directories are part of a larger package and you are executing the package as a module, you can use relative imports. However, this requires that the package is structured correctly and is executed as a module, which might not always be feasible.\n\nOverall, the first method is more direct and is often used for quick scripts, while the second method is more conventional for larger projects."
