I created a project and tried to start an app that uses customized users and registration with email validation, utilizing django-registration. However, when running `manage runserver`, I encountered an error: \"ValueError: Dependency on app with no migrations: customuser\". My `models.py` file contains the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser\nfrom django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _\n\nclass User(AbstractUser):\n    username = models.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True, verbose_name=_(\"Username\")) \n    email = models.EmailField(unique=True, verbose_name=_(\"Email Address\"))\n    favorite_animal = models.CharField(max_length=255, verbose_name=_(\"Favorite Animal\"))\n```\n\nWhat could be causing this ValueError and how can I fix it?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to Django's migration system. It indicates that Django cannot find migrations for your `customuser` app. Here\u2019s how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Migrations Directory Exists**: First, make sure that your app has a `migrations` directory, which is crucial for Django to handle database schema changes. This directory should have an `__init__.py` file to be recognized as a Python package.\n\n2. **Create Initial Migrations**: If you haven't created any migrations yet, you'll need to do so. Run the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py makemigrations\n   ```\n\n   This will create the initial migration files for the `customuser` app based on the models you've defined.\n\n3. **Apply Migrations**: Once the migration files are created, apply them to your database:\n\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py migrate\n   ```\n\n   This will apply the changes to your database schema.\n\n4. **Check for Dependencies**: If your app depends on other apps that haven't had migrations applied, you might encounter similar issues. Ensure that all apps in your project have their migrations up to date by running `makemigrations` and `migrate` for those apps as well.\n\n5. **Update Installed Apps**: Ensure that your app is included in the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in your `settings.py` file. It should look something like this:\n\n   ```python\n   INSTALLED_APPS = [\n       # ... other installed apps\n       'customuser',\n   ]\n   ```\n\n6. **Check for Any Circular Dependencies**: Sometimes circular dependencies between apps can cause issues. Make sure that your app doesn't depend circularly on another app that has not yet been migrated.\n\nOnce you've gone through these steps, your `ValueError` should be resolved, and your custom user model should be properly set up and ready to use."
