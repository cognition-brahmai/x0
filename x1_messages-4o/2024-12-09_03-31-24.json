I have the following model:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass PopulationData(models.Model):\n    slot = models.IntegerField(db_index=True)\n    sample = models.IntegerField()\n    value = models.FloatField()\n\n    class Meta:\n        unique_together = (('slot', 'sample'),)\n```\nI want to create a compound index on the column pair that has the `UNIQUE` constraint, like so:\n\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX my_compound_index ON myapp_populationdata (slot, sample);\n```\nCurrently, I have a separate code connected to the `post_syncdb` signal that issues the previous SQL statement. Is there any way to indicate it from the model specification? I'm using the Django 1.3 branch."

        "content": "In Django 1.3, there is no direct way to specify non-unique composite indexes directly in the model's `Meta` class. However, you can achieve this by using custom SQL. Since you are using Django 1.3 and it doesn't support the `indexes` option in the `Meta` class (which is available in Django 1.11 and later), you will need to use custom SQL files to define your composite index.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Create a SQL file for your custom index:**\n\n   You can create a SQL file that contains the SQL statement to create the composite index. Name this file `myapp/sql/populationdata.sql` (where `myapp` is the name of your Django app).\n\n   ```sql\n   CREATE INDEX my_compound_index ON myapp_populationdata (slot, sample);\n   ```\n\n2. **Place the SQL file in the appropriate directory:**\n\n   Place this SQL file in a directory named `sql` within your app directory. Django will look for SQL files in this location when you run `manage.py syncdb` (or `manage.py migrate` in later versions of Django).\n\n3. **Ensure the SQL file is executed:**\n\n   When you run `manage.py syncdb`, Django will execute the SQL file to create the index. Note that `syncdb` does not apply migrations in Django 1.3 (migrations were introduced in Django 1.7).\n\n4. **Using South for migrations:**\n\n   If you are using South for schema migrations (a popular choice before Django 1.7 introduced native migrations), you can create a migration for your index. South allows you to write custom SQL in migrations. Here\u2019s a basic example:\n\n   ```python\n   from south.db import db\n   from django.db import models\n\n   class Migration:\n       def forwards(self):\n           db.execute(\"CREATE INDEX my_compound_index ON myapp_populationdata (slot, sample);\")\n\n       def backwards(self):\n           db.execute(\"DROP INDEX my_compound_index;\")\n\n   ```\n\n5. **Consider upgrading:**\n\n   Since you are using a very old version of Django, consider upgrading to a newer version where defining composite indexes becomes much more straightforward using the `indexes` option in the `Meta` class of your model.\n\nIf you decide to upgrade Django to a version that supports it (like Django 1.11 or later), you can use the `indexes` option:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass PopulationData(models.Model):\n    slot = models.IntegerField(db_index=True)\n    sample = models.IntegerField()\n    value = models.FloatField()\n\n    class Meta:\n        indexes = [\n            models.Index(fields=['slot', 'sample'], name='my_compound_index'),\n        ]\n        unique_together = (('slot', 'sample'),)\n```\n\nThis way, you can manage your database schema directly from the Django model without resorting to custom SQL."
