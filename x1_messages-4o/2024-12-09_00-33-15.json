I am attempting to write this response out to an Excel file. However, I encounter an error that says \"TypeError: expected a character buffer object\" when I try to write the response to the file. How can I resolve this issue?\n\nHere is the code for reference:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\nfiles = {'f': ('1.pdf', open('1.pdf', 'rb'))}\nresponse = requests.post(\"https://pdftables.com/api?&format=xlsx-single\",files=files)\nresponse.raise_for_status() # ensure we notice bad responses\nfile = open(\"out.xls\", \"w\")\nfile.write(response)\nfile.close()\n```\n\nAnd this is the error I'm getting:\n\n```python\nfile.write(response)\nTypeError: expected a character buffer object\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering occurs because the `response` object from the `requests` library isn't a string or character buffer that can be directly written to a file. The `response` object contains the entire HTTP response, which includes headers and other metadata, not just the content you want to save. To write the content of the response to a file, you need to access the `response.content` attribute, which contains the raw bytes of the response body. Since you're writing an Excel file, you'll also want to open the file in binary write mode.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to resolve the issue:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\nfiles = {'f': ('1.pdf', open('1.pdf', 'rb'))}\nresponse = requests.post(\"https://pdftables.com/api?&format=xlsx-single\", files=files)\nresponse.raise_for_status()  # ensure we notice bad responses\n\n# Open the output file in binary write mode\nwith open(\"out.xlsx\", \"wb\") as file:\n    file.write(response.content)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Binary Write Mode:** Open the output file with `\"wb\"` mode to write binary data.\n2. **`response.content`:** Use `response.content` to get the raw bytes of the response body suitable for writing binary data to a file.\n3. **Context Manager:** Use a `with` statement to open the file, which ensures that the file is properly closed after writing. \n\nNote: Ensure that the API call is correctly formatted and that the API you're interacting with is capable of returning data in the format you expect (in this case, an Excel file). Adjust the URL and request method parameters as necessary based on the API documentation."
