        "content": "In Python, is there a standard way to normalize a unicode string so that it only includes the simplest unicode entities that can be used to represent it? For instance, I would like to convert a sequence like ['LATIN SMALL LETTER A', 'COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT'] to ['LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH ACUTE']. I have tried the following code:\n\n```python\nimport unicodedata\nchar = \"\u00e1\"\nlen(char)\n[ unicodedata.name(c) for c in char ]\n```\n\nIt returns ['LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH ACUTE'] which is correct, but for some unicode character \"a\u0301\", it returns ['LATIN SMALL LETTER A', 'COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT'] when I use the same code:\n\n```python\nchar = \"a\u0301\"\nlen(char)\n[ unicodedata.name(c) for c in char ]\n```\n\nI could possibly iterate over all the characters and perform manual replacements, but I am concerned it might not be efficient and I could miss out on many special cases and make errors. Is there a better solution to this?"

        "content": "Yes, there is a standard way to normalize Unicode strings in Python, which helps convert characters composed of a base character and combining marks into their precomposed form, if such a form exists. You can use the `unicodedata` module's `normalize` function to achieve this. The `normalize` function allows you to specify a normalization form, and for your case, you want to use the \"NFC\" (Normalization Form C) form. This form composes characters to their canonical composed form, which is exactly what you need.\n\nHere's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nimport unicodedata\n\n# Original string with combining character\nchar = \"a\u0301\"\n\n# Normalize to NFC\nnormalized_char = unicodedata.normalize('NFC', char)\n\n# Check the length and names of characters in the normalized string\nprint(len(normalized_char))  # Should print 1\nprint([unicodedata.name(c) for c in normalized_char])  # Should print ['LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH ACUTE']\n```\n\nBy using `unicodedata.normalize('NFC', char)`, the sequence of \"LATIN SMALL LETTER A\" and \"COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT\" is converted to \"LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH ACUTE\", which is a single precomposed character. This approach is efficient and handles special cases automatically, as it relies on Unicode's normalization rules."
