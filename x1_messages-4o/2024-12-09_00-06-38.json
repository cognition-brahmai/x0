For example, if I have the string \"The journey lasted for 8 hours,\" how can I replace \"lasted\" with \"took\" to get \"The journey took for 8 hours\"? Can you provide some sample Java code to accomplish this task?"

        "content": "Certainly! In Java, you can use the `replace` or `replaceAll` method of the `String` class to replace a specific word in a string. Here's a simple example to demonstrate how you can replace the word \"lasted\" with \"took\" in the given string:\n\n```java\npublic class ReplaceWordExample {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Original string\n        String originalString = \"The journey lasted for 8 hours.\";\n\n        // Word to be replaced\n        String targetWord = \"lasted\";\n\n        // New word to replace with\n        String replacementWord = \"took\";\n\n        // Replacing the word\n        String modifiedString = originalString.replace(targetWord, replacementWord);\n\n        // Displaying the modified string\n        System.out.println(\"Original String: \" + originalString);\n        System.out.println(\"Modified String: \" + modifiedString);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **originalString**: This is the initial string where you want to make the replacement.\n- **targetWord**: This is the word you want to replace in the original string.\n- **replacementWord**: This is the new word that will replace the target word.\n- **replace() method**: This method will replace all occurrences of the target word with the replacement word in the original string.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\nOriginal String: The journey lasted for 8 hours.\nModified String: The journey took for 8 hours.\n```\n\nThis simple code snippet will help you replace any specific word in a Java string with another word as needed."
