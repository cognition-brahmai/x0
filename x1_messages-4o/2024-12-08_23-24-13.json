We can observe:\n- 3 to 5 increases by 2.\n- __ to 18 increases by 13.\n- 18 to 25 increases by 7.\n\nIf we assume that the differences follow a pattern, let's check if there's a sequence. It seems the differences themselves might be forming a sequence. Let's try adding 2, 4, 6, 8, etc., to 3:\n- 3 + 2 = 5\n- 5 + 4 = 9\n- 9 + 6 = 15\n- 15 + 8 = 23\n\nLet's adjust the sequence accordingly:\n- 3, 5, 9, 18, 25\n\nNow, let's apply these differences to the original sequence:\n- Start with 5.\n- 5 + 3 = 8\n- 8 + 5 = 13\n- 13 + 9 = 22\n- 22 + 18 = 40\n- 40 + 25 = 65\n\nTherefore, the missing number in the sequence is 22."
