I have tried using multi-line strings but they introduce a newline `\\n` character which is causing my tests to fail. Here are the two versions of my string, the first one is the original long string and the second one is my attempt at splitting it into multiple lines:\n```python\nf'Leave Request created successfully. Approvers sent the request for approval: {leave_approver_list}'\n\nf'''Leave Request created successfully.\nApprovers sent the request for approval: {leave_approver_list}'''\n```\nHow can I split this string into multiple lines without introducing newline characters and while still adhering to PEP 8 standards?"

        "content": "To split a long f-string in Python without introducing newline characters and while adhering to PEP 8 standards, you can use parentheses to implicitly concatenate the strings. This way, you can split the string across multiple lines without adding any unwanted newline characters. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nf_string = (\n    f\"Leave Request created successfully. \"\n    f\"Approvers sent the request for approval: {leave_approver_list}\"\n)\n```\n\nIn this approach, Python automatically concatenates the strings inside the parentheses, and the f-string formatting is preserved. This method is PEP 8 compliant and ensures that no extra newline characters are introduced into the string."
