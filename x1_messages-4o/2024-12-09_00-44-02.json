        "content": "Your approach is already quite efficient and pythonic, using list comprehensions to achieve the desired duplication and suffix addition. However, if you're looking for a slightly more concise version, you can use a single list comprehension with the `chain` function from the `itertools` module to flatten the list:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import chain\n\na = ['a', 'b', 'c']\nc = list(chain.from_iterable((x, f\"{x}_ind\") for x in a))\nprint(c)\n```\n\nThis approach uses `chain.from_iterable` to flatten the list of tuples generated by the comprehension, resulting in the desired output. This method is clean and eliminates the need for a double list comprehension."
