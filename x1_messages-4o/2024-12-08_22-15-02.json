        "content": "To compute the mean and standard deviation for the set of numbers 2, 3, 7, and 5, follow these steps:\n\n**Mean:**\n\n1. Add all the numbers together: \\(2 + 3 + 7 + 5 = 17\\).\n2. Divide the sum by the total number of data points: \\( \\frac{17}{4} = 4.25\\).\n\nSo, the mean is 4.25.\n\n**Standard Deviation:**\n\n1. Subtract the mean from each number and square the result:\n   - \\( (2 - 4.25)^2 = 5.0625 \\)\n   - \\( (3 - 4.25)^2 = 1.5625 \\)\n   - \\( (7 - 4.25)^2 = 7.5625 \\)\n   - \\( (5 - 4.25)^2 = 0.5625 \\)\n\n2. Find the average of these squared differences:\n   - Sum of squared differences: \\(5.0625 + 1.5625 + 7.5625 + 0.5625 = 14.75\\)\n   - Divide by the number of data points: \\(\\frac{14.75}{4} = 3.6875\\)\n\n3. Take the square root of the average: \\(\\sqrt{3.6875} \\approx 1.9203\\).\n\nSo, the standard deviation is approximately 1.9203."
