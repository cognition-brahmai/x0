I prefer everything in 64 bits as I need Cython for another package for some specialized numerical analysis and x64 is potentially an advantage for storage of large data sets. I downloaded the x64 Python 2.7 from the official website and got Cython from Christoph Gohlke. I added Python 2.7 into the registry with the .reg file and installed the Visual C++ compiler. I have tried building a \"hello world\" test file following the instructions on the Cython documentation page. When I try to build the extension in place, I first encountered an error saying that it's unable to find vcvarsall.bat. I renamed vcvars64.bat to vcvarsall.bat and then encountered a fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'basetsd.h': No such file or directory. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "It seems like you're encountering a common issue when setting up Cython with Python 2.7 on a 64-bit Windows system. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you resolve these issues:\n\n1. **Verify Visual C++ Build Tools Installation**: \n   - Ensure you have the correct version of Visual C++ Build Tools installed. For Python 2.7, you need to have the Visual C++ 2008 compiler. It's possible that you're using a more recent version that doesn't include the necessary files for Python 2.7.\n\n2. **Environment Variables**:\n   - Ensure that your environment variables are correctly set up. Specifically, verify that the `INCLUDE` and `LIB` paths in your environment variables point to the directories containing the necessary header and library files, like `basetsd.h`.\n\n3. **Windows SDK**:\n   - Install the Windows 7 SDK, which includes the `basetsd.h` file. You can download it from the Microsoft website. This SDK includes the headers and libraries you might be missing.\n\n4. **Correct `vcvarsall.bat` Setup**:\n   - Reverting the renaming of `vcvars64.bat` back to its original name might be necessary. Instead, ensure that your environment is set up correctly by running the appropriate `vcvarsall.bat` from the Visual C++ 2008 or corresponding compiler that supports x64.\n\n5. **Ensure Compiler Compatibility**:\n   - Double-check that the compiler being used matches the architecture of your Python installation (x64 in this case). The Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable is required for compatibility with Python 2.7.\n\n6. **Cython and Python Version**:\n   - Be sure you are using a version of Cython that is compatible with Python 2.7. Although Python 2.7 is outdated, using the latest Cython version that supports it could help.\n\n7. **Alternative Python Distribution**:\n   - Consider using a pre-packaged Python distribution like Anaconda or WinPython, which might simplify the setup process by including pre-built binaries.\n\n8. **Building with Setup Script**:\n   - If you are using a setup script (`setup.py`), ensure it is correctly configured. Sometimes providing the full path to the compiler and necessary libraries can resolve issues.\n\nIf after these steps you still encounter issues, it might be helpful to check online forums or communities for specific guidance related to the software versions you are using."
