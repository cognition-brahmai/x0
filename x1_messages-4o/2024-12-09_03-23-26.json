        "content": "To convert a `datetime.timedelta` object into a more readable format with minutes and hours, you can extract the total number of seconds and then convert those seconds into hours and minutes. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n```python\nfrom django.utils.timezone import utc\nimport datetime\n\nstart_date = datetime.datetime.utcnow().replace(tzinfo=utc)\n# Simulating a delay for demonstration purposes\nend_date = start_date + datetime.timedelta(seconds=3661)  # Example duration of 1 hour, 1 minute, and 1 second\nduration = end_date - start_date\n\n# Get the total number of seconds\ntotal_seconds = int(duration.total_seconds())\n\n# Calculate hours and minutes\nhours = total_seconds // 3600\nminutes = (total_seconds % 3600) // 60\nseconds = total_seconds % 60\n\n# Format the output\noutput = f\"{hours} hour{'s' if hours != 1 else ''}, {minutes} minute{'s' if minutes != 1 else ''}\"\n\nprint(output)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `total_seconds()` gives you the total number of seconds in the `timedelta`.\n- To get the number of hours, you perform an integer division of `total_seconds` by 3600 (the number of seconds in an hour).\n- The remaining seconds are calculated using the modulus operator `%`.\n- Then, the number of minutes is calculated by dividing the remaining seconds by 60.\n- Lastly, format the string to accommodate singular and plural forms of \"hour\" and \"minute\" appropriately.\n\nThis code will output \"1 hour, 1 minute\" for the example provided. Adjust the `end_date` as per your actual use case to see results accordingly."
