For many types of JSON errors such as missing delimiters, incorrect backslashes in strings, etc, Python prints a helpful error message indicating the line and column number where the error was found. However, for other types of JSON errors, like using a comma on the last item in a list or capitalizing true/false, Python's output is simply \"No JSON object could be decoded\". Here is the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nwith open(filename, \"r\") as f:\n  data = json.loads(f.read())\n```\n\nAnd here is the error traceback I'm getting:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"myfile.py\", line 8, in myfunction\n    config = json.loads(f.read())\n  File \"c:\\python27\\lib\\json\\__init__.py\", line 326, in loads\n    return _default_decoder.decode(s)\n  File \"c:\\python27\\lib\\json\\decoder.py\", line 360, in decode\n    obj, end = self.raw_decode(s, idx=_w(s, 0).end())\n  File \"c:\\python27\\lib\\json\\decoder.py\", line 378, in raw_decode\n    raise ValueError(\"No JSON object could be decoded\")\nValueError: No JSON object could be decoded\n```\n\nHow can I get Python to tell me where the error is in the JSON file when this type of ValueError occurs?"

        "content": "When dealing with JSON parsing in Python, especially with the standard library, the error messages can sometimes be vague, as you've noticed. However, there are a few strategies you can employ to get more informative error messages:\n\n1. **Use a JSON Validator:**\n   Before loading your JSON file in Python, you can use online JSON validators like [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/) to check for syntax errors. These tools often provide more detailed error messages, including line numbers and specific issues.\n\n2. **Try Using `simplejson`:**\n   The `simplejson` library is a third-party JSON library that can sometimes provide more informative error messages than the built-in `json` module. You can install it via pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install simplejson\n   ```\n\n   Then, modify your code to use `simplejson` instead:\n\n   ```python\n   import simplejson as json\n\n   with open(filename, \"r\") as f:\n       try:\n           data = json.loads(f.read())\n       except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n           print(f\"Error decoding JSON: {e}\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Manually Validate JSON Syntax:**\n   You can write a small script to validate JSON syntax line by line. This can help pinpoint the exact location of the error:\n\n   ```python\n   import json\n\n   def validate_json_line_by_line(filename):\n       with open(filename, 'r') as f:\n           for i, line in enumerate(f, 1):\n               try:\n                   json.loads(line)\n               except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n                   print(f\"Error on line {i}: {e}\")\n\n   validate_json_line_by_line(filename)\n   ```\n\n   This script attempts to decode each line individually, which can help identify which line contains the error. Note that this method assumes each line is a standalone JSON object, which may not be the case for your file. It can still help narrow down the problematic area.\n\n4. **Check JSON Format:**\n   Make sure your JSON file adheres to the proper JSON syntax. Common issues include:\n   - Ensure that boolean values are lowercase (`true`, `false`).\n   - Remove trailing commas in objects or arrays.\n   - Ensure that strings are properly quoted with double quotes.\n   - Use `null` for null values instead of `None`.\n\nBy using these methods, you should be able to get a better indication of where the error occurs in your JSON file."
