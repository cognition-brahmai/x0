        "content": "I have a Python sequence of variable-length lists and I am trying to convert it into a NumPy array. However, the implicit conversion of this sequence into a NumPy array causes the array to be of type object, as shown below:\n\n```python\nv = [[1], [1, 2]]\nnp.array(v)\n# Output: array([[1], [1, 2]], dtype=object)\n```\nWhen I try to force another type, it results in an exception:\n\n```python\nnp.array(v, dtype=np.int32)\n# Output: ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence.\n```\nWhat is the most efficient way to convert this sequence into a dense NumPy array of type int32 by filling the missing values with a given placeholder? For example, if 0 is the placeholder, from my sample sequence v, I would like to get the following result:\n\n```python\n# Desired output: array([[1, 0], [1, 2]], dtype=int32)\n```"

        "content": "To convert a sequence of variable-length lists into a dense NumPy array, you can first determine the maximum length of the lists, then create a new list where each sublist is padded with the placeholder value to match this maximum length. Finally, you can convert this padded list into a NumPy array with the desired dtype. Here's how you can do this efficiently:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nv = [[1], [1, 2]]\nplaceholder = 0\n\n# Determine the maximum length of the lists\nmax_length = max(len(sublist) for sublist in v)\n\n# Create a new list where each sublist is padded with the placeholder\npadded_v = [sublist + [placeholder] * (max_length - len(sublist)) for sublist in v]\n\n# Convert the padded list into a NumPy array with the desired dtype\nresult = np.array(padded_v, dtype=np.int32)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will produce the desired output:\n\n```\narray([[1, 0],\n       [1, 2]], dtype=int32)\n```\n\nThis method ensures that each sublist is extended to the same length with the specified placeholder value, allowing the entire structure to be converted into a dense NumPy array with a consistent dtype."
