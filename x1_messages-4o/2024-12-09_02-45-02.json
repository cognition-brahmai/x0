I followed the tutorial found at http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/using_gpu.html. However, when I run the example code `THEANO_FLAGS=mode=FAST_RUN,device=gpu,floatX=float32 python check1.py`, it seems to use the CPU instead of the GPU. The terminal output gives me a warning: `CUDA is installed, but device gpu0 is not  available  (error: cuda unavailable)`. I also tried running `THEANO_FLAGS=device=cuda0 python check1.py` but the output says `ERROR (theano.sandbox.gpuarray): pygpu was configured but could not be imported` and it still used the CPU. I have installed the CUDA toolkit from apt. How can I fix this issue?"

        "content": "Running deep learning models on a GPU using Theano on an older version of Ubuntu like 16.04 can be challenging due to compatibility issues with CUDA, Theano, and the GPU driver. Here are some steps you can follow to troubleshoot and potentially resolve your issue:\n\n1. **Verify CUDA Installation:**\n   - Ensure that the CUDA toolkit and driver versions are compatible with each other and with your GPU. You can check compatibility on NVIDIA's website.\n   - Verify if CUDA is properly installed by running `nvcc --version` and `nvidia-smi` in the terminal. This should display the CUDA version and show details about your GPU if everything is installed correctly.\n\n2. **Check GPU Drivers:**\n   - Make sure that the NVIDIA drivers are correctly installed and up to date. Sometimes, using the drivers from the official NVIDIA website rather than the ones from the Ubuntu repositories can help.\n   - You can check the driver version with `nvidia-smi`.\n\n3. **Install and Configure PyCUDA and libgpuarray:**\n   - Install PyCUDA, which is required by Theano to access GPU functionalities:\n     ```bash\n     pip install pycuda\n     ```\n   - Install `libgpuarray` and `pygpu` for Theano:\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev\n     git clone https://github.com/Theano/libgpuarray.git\n     cd libgpuarray\n     mkdir Build\n     cd Build\n     cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\n     make\n     sudo make install\n     cd ..\n     python setup.py build\n     python setup.py install\n     ```\n\n4. **Configure Theano:**\n   - Ensure your `.theanorc` file is properly configured. It should look something like this:\n     ```\n     [global]\n     floatX = float32\n     device = cuda\n\n     [nvcc]\n     fastmath = True\n\n     [lib]\n     cnmem = 0.8\n\n     [blas]\n     ldflags = -lopenblas\n\n     [gpuarray]\n     preallocate = 1\n     ```\n\n5. **Verify Python Environment:**\n   - Ensure you\u2019re using a compatible version of Python for Theano. Sometimes Python 3.x may have issues with older versions of Theano, so you might want to try using Python 2.7 if you encounter any further issues.\n\n6. **Test with a Simple Script:**\n   - Try running a simple Theano script to see if the GPU is being utilized. This can help isolate whether it's an issue with your environment or with the specific script you are trying to run.\n\n7. **Consider Upgrading:**\n   - If possible, consider upgrading your Ubuntu version and using a more modern deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch, which may have better support and documentation for newer environments.\n\nIf after following these steps you still encounter issues, it may be helpful to consult forums such as Stack Overflow or the Theano user group, as others may have encountered similar problems."
