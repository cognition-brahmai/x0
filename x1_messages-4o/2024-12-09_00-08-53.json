        "content": "Designing a robust encryption algorithm for securely storing sensitive information is a critical task, especially for a financial institution. To achieve this, you should leverage well-established cryptographic libraries and algorithms rather than attempting to create your own from scratch. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to implement this using C#:\n\n### Step 1: Choose a Cryptographic Library\n\nFor C#, the `System.Security.Cryptography` namespace provides a robust set of cryptographic services. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely used and highly secure algorithm suitable for this purpose.\n\n### Step 2: Implement AES Encryption and Decryption\n\nBelow is a sample implementation of AES encryption and decryption in C#:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.IO;\nusing System.Security.Cryptography;\nusing System.Text;\n\npublic class AesEncryption\n{\n    private static readonly byte[] Key = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(\"Your16CharKeyHere\");\n    private static readonly byte[] IV = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(\"Your16CharIVHere\");\n\n    public static string Encrypt(string plainText)\n    {\n        using (Aes aes = Aes.Create())\n        {\n            aes.Key = Key;\n            aes.IV = IV;\n\n            ICryptoTransform encryptor = aes.CreateEncryptor(aes.Key, aes.IV);\n\n            using (MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream())\n            {\n                using (CryptoStream cs = new CryptoStream(ms, encryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Write))\n                {\n                    using (StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter(cs))\n                    {\n                        sw.Write(plainText);\n                    }\n                }\n                return Convert.ToBase64String(ms.ToArray());\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static string Decrypt(string cipherText)\n    {\n        using (Aes aes = Aes.Create())\n        {\n            aes.Key = Key;\n            aes.IV = IV;\n\n            ICryptoTransform decryptor = aes.CreateDecryptor(aes.Key, aes.IV);\n\n            using (MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream(Convert.FromBase64String(cipherText)))\n            {\n                using (CryptoStream cs = new CryptoStream(ms, decryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Read))\n                {\n                    using (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(cs))\n                    {\n                        return sr.ReadToEnd();\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Sample Data for Testing\n\nYou can use the following sample set of personal information data for testing:\n\n```plaintext\nName: John Doe\nAddress: 123 Main St, Anytown, AN 12345\nSocial Security Number: 123-45-6789\n```\n\n### Step 4: Testing the Encryption and Decryption\n\nTo test the encryption and decryption, you can run the following code:\n\n```csharp\npublic class Program\n{\n    public static void Main()\n    {\n        string sensitiveData = \"Name: John Doe\\nAddress: 123 Main St, Anytown, AN 12345\\nSocial Security Number: 123-45-6789\";\n        \n        string encryptedData = AesEncryption.Encrypt(sensitiveData);\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Encrypted: {encryptedData}\");\n\n        string decryptedData = AesEncryption.Decrypt(encryptedData);\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Decrypted: {decryptedData}\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 5: Testing the Strength of the Encryption\n\nTo test the strength of the encryption algorithm without sharing the decryption algorithm:\n\n1. **Key Size and Configuration**: Ensure you use a strong key size (e.g., 256 bits) and secure IV.\n2. **Security Audits**: Conduct security audits and penetration testing.\n3. **Algorithm Testing Tools**: Use tools like Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP) to validate the implementation.\n4. **Independent Reviews**: Have the algorithm reviewed by independent security experts.\n\n### Important Considerations\n\n- **Key Management**: Securely store and manage encryption keys. Use a Key Management Service (KMS) if possible.\n- **IV Security**: Ensure the IV is unique for each encryption operation to enhance security.\n- **Performance**: Test the performance of your implementation under load to ensure it meets your efficiency requirements.\n\nBy following these steps, you can create a secure system for encrypting sensitive information using C#."
