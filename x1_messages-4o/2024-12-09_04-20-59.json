This thread is meant to handle some background work that is initiated by a request, but I don't need it to complete before responding to the request. I want to set the Flask request in this sub-thread as the incoming request. The reason being, our Access Control List (ACL) on our queries to our Database (we use MongoEngine in front of MongoDB) relies on the request's user (which is derived from Flask's request object) to determine if they have access to the objects. However, the code is failing because the request is not available in the sub-thread. Is there a way to make this work? Here's my code:\n\n```python\n@app.route('/my_endpoint', methods=['POST'])\ndef my_endpoint_handler():\n    #do tracking in sub-thread so we don't hold up the page\n    def handle_sub_view(req):\n        from flask import request\n        request = req\n        # Do Expensive work\n    thread.start_new_thread(handle_sub_view, (request))\n    return \"Thanks\"\n```\n\nHowever, this code is throwing the error 'working outside of request context'. Any suggestions on how to solve this?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that Flask's request context is not available in the new thread. Flask uses a context stack to manage the request and application contexts, and this stack is not automatically propagated to new threads.\n\nTo solve this issue, you can manually push the request context to the sub-thread. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, copy_current_request_context\nimport threading\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/my_endpoint', methods=['POST'])\ndef my_endpoint_handler():\n    \n    @copy_current_request_context\n    def handle_sub_view():\n        # You can now access the request object here\n        # Do the Expensive work\n        user = request.user  # Example of accessing the request object\n        print(f\"Handling request for user: {user}\")\n\n    # Start a new thread to handle the sub-view\n    thread = threading.Thread(target=handle_sub_view)\n    thread.start()\n\n    return \"Thanks\"\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`copy_current_request_context`:** This decorator copies the current request context and makes it available to the function it decorates. This allows your sub-thread to access the request object as if it were running in the main thread.\n\n2. **`threading.Thread`:** Instead of using `thread.start_new_thread`, which is a lower-level and less flexible threading approach, we use Python's `threading.Thread` class, which allows for more control and is generally preferred for threading in Python.\n\n3. **No need to pass `request`:** Because the request context is copied, you don't need to pass the request object explicitly to the sub-thread.\n\nThis way, the request context will be properly set up for the sub-thread, allowing you to access request-specific information like the user for your ACL checks."
