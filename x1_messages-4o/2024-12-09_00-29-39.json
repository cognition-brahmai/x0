        "content": "The error you're encountering is likely because of the version of TensorFlow you're using. In TensorFlow 2.0, the `config.experimental.list_physical_devices` method is not available. Instead, you should use `tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')`. However, in later versions of TensorFlow (from 2.1 onwards), the method `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')` is used.\n\nSince you are using TensorFlow 2.0, you can try the following:\n\n1. First, ensure that your TensorFlow version is indeed 2.0 by running:\n\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n   print(tf.__version__)\n   ```\n\n2. If the version is confirmed to be 2.0, you can use the following code to list the available GPUs:\n\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n   from tensorflow.python.client import device_lib\n\n   def get_available_gpus():\n       local_device_protos = device_lib.list_local_devices()\n       return [x.name for x in local_device_protos if x.device_type == 'GPU']\n\n   print(\"Available GPUs:\", get_available_gpus())\n   ```\n\n3. Alternatively, consider upgrading TensorFlow to a newer version where `tf.config.list_physical_devices` is available. You can upgrade TensorFlow using pip:\n\n   ```shell\n   pip install --upgrade tensorflow\n   ```\n\n   After upgrading, you can use:\n\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n   gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\n   print(\"Num GPUs Available: \", len(gpus))\n   ```\n\nThis should help you resolve the issue and correctly identify the GPUs available for use with TensorFlow."
