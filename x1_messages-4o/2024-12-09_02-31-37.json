For instance, in a script named test.sh, I have the following code:\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\nmongo myDbName\ndb.mycollection.findOne()\nshow collections\n```\n\nWhen I run the script using ./test.sh, it establishes a connection to MongoDB, but it doesn't execute the subsequent commands. How can I get these commands to execute within the shell script test.sh?"

        "content": "To execute MongoDB commands through a shell script, you can pass the commands to the `mongo` shell as a JavaScript file or directly as a string using the `--eval` option. Here's how you can modify your `test.sh` script to accomplish this:\n\n### Method 1: Using a JavaScript File\n1. Create a JavaScript file, say `commands.js`, with the MongoDB commands you want to run:\n   ```javascript\n   db.mycollection.findOne();\n   show collections;\n   ```\n\n2. Modify your `test.sh` script to execute this JavaScript file:\n   ```sh\n   #!/bin/sh\n   mongo myDbName commands.js\n   ```\n\n### Method 2: Using the `--eval` Option\nYou can pass the commands directly using the `--eval` option:\n```sh\n#!/bin/sh\nmongo myDbName --eval 'printjson(db.mycollection.findOne()); db.getCollectionNames().forEach(function(c) { print(c) });'\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **JavaScript File Method**: This method is useful if you have multiple commands or complex logic, as it keeps your script clean and allows you to use JavaScript syntax fully.\n- **`--eval` Option**: This is suitable for running simple commands directly from the shell script. Note that `--eval` runs the command in the context of the MongoDB shell, so you can execute JavaScript directly.\n\n### Important Tips\n- Ensure the MongoDB shell (`mongo`) is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.\n- You might need to adjust the `printjson` and `print` functions to properly output results in the shell, especially for `findOne()` and listing collections.\n- Make sure the MongoDB server is running and accessible when you execute the script.\n\nChoose the method that best suits your needs and the complexity of the commands you wish to execute."
