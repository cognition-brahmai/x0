Is there a way to perform this initialization only once in one place so that the same settings can be reused for logging throughout the project?"

        "content": "Yes, you can centralize the logging configuration by setting it up once in a dedicated module and then importing this setup across the other modules in your project. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Create a dedicated logging configuration module**: Let's create a new Python file, for example, `logger_config.py`, in your project directory. This file will contain the logging configuration setup.\n\n2. **Initialize logging in `logger_config.py`**:\n   ```python\n   # logger_config.py\n   import logging.config\n\n   logging.config.fileConfig('logging.conf')\n   logger = logging.getLogger('pyApp')\n   ```\n\n3. **Use the logger in other modules**: In your other modules, you can import the `logger` from `logger_config.py` and use it for logging.\n\n   For example, in `test01.py`:\n   ```python\n   # test01.py\n   from logger_config import logger\n\n   logger.info('This is a log message from test01')\n   ```\n\n   And in `test02.py`:\n   ```python\n   # test02.py\n   from logger_config import logger\n\n   logger.info('This is a log message from test02')\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, your logging configuration is centralized in `logger_config.py`. You only need to modify the logging setup in one place (`logger_config.py`) if you ever need to change it. This way, all modules that import the logger will automatically use the updated configuration."
