Amoebas are single-celled organisms that are typically found in water or moist environments. They are characterized by their ability to change shape and move using pseudopodia (temporary projections of their cytoplasm). Protists are a diverse group of eukaryotic microorganisms, and amoebas fit this description due to their unicellular nature and mode of movement.\n\nIn contrast, fungi, which include organisms like yeast, mold, and mushrooms, are primarily multicellular (with the exception of some unicellular fungi like yeast) and have a different mode of nutrition, obtaining nutrients through absorption. Amoebas, on the other hand, ingest their food through phagocytosis, which aligns them more closely with protists."
