You decide to use a letter shuffling technique to create a unique code for each invitation. \nTo create the code, you will take the first three letters of your friend's name and the last three letters of their favorite food. Then, you will shuffle the letters to create a new string. \nFor example, if your friend's name is \"Alex\" and their favorite food is \"pizza\", you would create the code \"zalixepp\". \nCan you create a code for your friend named \"Emma\" whose favorite food is \"sushi\"? Remember, the code must contain all six letters but in a different order."

One possible code could be \"mimesh.\" \n\nFeel free to shuffle the letters in any other combination to create different codes, such as \"meshim\" or \"shimem.\""
