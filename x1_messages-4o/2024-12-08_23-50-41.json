        "content": "To solve this problem, you need to join the `employees` table with the `physical_characteristics` table and perform some additional filtering and aggregation to find employees who share at least two physical characteristics with Willy Wonka. Here's a SQL query to achieve this:\n\n```sql\nWITH WillyWonkaCharacteristics AS (\n    SELECT pc.height, pc.hair_color, pc.eye_color\n    FROM employees e\n    JOIN physical_characteristics pc ON e.name = pc.employee_name\n    WHERE e.name = 'Willy Wonka'\n),\nSameDepartmentEmployees AS (\n    SELECT e.name, e.age, e.occupation, e.department, pc.height, pc.hair_color, pc.eye_color\n    FROM employees e\n    JOIN physical_characteristics pc ON e.name = pc.employee_name\n    WHERE e.department = (\n        SELECT department\n        FROM employees\n        WHERE name = 'Willy Wonka'\n    ) AND e.name <> 'Willy Wonka'\n),\nMatchingCharacteristicsCount AS (\n    SELECT sde.name, sde.age, sde.occupation,\n           (CASE WHEN sde.height = wwc.height THEN 1 ELSE 0 END +\n            CASE WHEN sde.hair_color = wwc.hair_color THEN 1 ELSE 0 END +\n            CASE WHEN sde.eye_color = wwc.eye_color THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS match_count\n    FROM SameDepartmentEmployees sde\n    CROSS JOIN WillyWonkaCharacteristics wwc\n)\nSELECT name, age, occupation\nFROM MatchingCharacteristicsCount\nWHERE match_count >= 2;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **WillyWonkaCharacteristics CTE**: This Common Table Expression (CTE) retrieves Willy Wonka's physical characteristics (height, hair color, and eye color).\n\n2. **SameDepartmentEmployees CTE**: This CTE selects all employees who work in the same department as Willy Wonka (excluding Willy Wonka himself), along with their physical characteristics.\n\n3. **MatchingCharacteristicsCount CTE**: This CTE calculates the number of matching characteristics for each employee in the same department as Willy Wonka by comparing their characteristics against Willy Wonka's. The `CROSS JOIN` is used to compare each employee's characteristics with Willy Wonka's characteristics.\n\n4. **Final SELECT**: The final query selects the name, age, and occupation of employees who have at least two matching characteristics with Willy Wonka.\n\nThis query assumes that both tables have the necessary data and that each employee's name is unique in the `employees` table. Adjust the query as needed based on your database schema and constraints."
