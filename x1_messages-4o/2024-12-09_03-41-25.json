There is no shorthand like `Optional[T, U]` in Python's typing system. Therefore, you should either use `Union[T, U, None]` directly or `Optional[Union[T, U]]` if you prefer to emphasize the optionality aspect. Both are equivalent in meaning, allowing for either `T`, `U`, or `None` as valid values."
