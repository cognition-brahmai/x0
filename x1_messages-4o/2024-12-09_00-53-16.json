I can select all items \"DeutscheBahn\" in the column \"Train\" using `DB = df[df['Train'] == 'DeutscheBahn']`. However, I am struggling to select all trains except DeutscheBahn and British Rails and SNCF simultaneously. I can select them individually using `notDB = df[df['Train'] != 'DeutscheBahn']` and `notSNCF = df[df['Train'] != 'SNCF']`, but I am not sure how to combine these into one command. The command `df[df['Train'] != 'DeutscheBahn', 'SNCF']` does not work. How can I achieve this?"

This method allows you to filter out multiple values at once. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nexcluded_trains = ['DeutscheBahn', 'British Rails', 'SNCF']\nfiltered_df = df[~df['Train'].isin(excluded_trains)]\n```\n\nThis command creates a list of train companies you want to exclude and then uses the `isin()` method to filter out those rows from the DataFrame. The `~` operator negates the condition, effectively selecting all rows where the 'Train' value is not in the list `excluded_trains`."
