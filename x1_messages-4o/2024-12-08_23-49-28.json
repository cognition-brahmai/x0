Here's an enhanced version of the PHP code with additional explanations of the pricing strategies:\n\n### Optimized PHP Code with Pricing Strategies\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Establish a database connection with error handling\n$servername = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"username\";\n$password = \"password\";\n$dbname = \"myDB\";\n\n$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);\n\nif ($conn->connect_error) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n}\n\n// SQL query to calculate total cost with detailed pricing strategies and discounts\n$sql = \"SELECT SUM(\n            CASE \n                WHEN Quantity >= 10 THEN Quantity * (Price * 0.75)  -- 25% discount for bulk purchases\n                WHEN Quantity >= 5 AND Price > 500 THEN Quantity * (Price * 0.8)  -- 20% discount for high-value items\n                WHEN Quantity >= 3 AND Price > 100 THEN Quantity * (Price * 0.9)  -- 10% discount for medium purchases\n                ELSE Quantity * Price  -- No discount\n            END\n        ) AS TotalCost \n        FROM apple_products\";\n\n$result = $conn->query($sql);\n\nif ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n    while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n        echo \"The total cost of purchasing the specific Apple products with applied discounts and pricing strategies is $\" . number_format($row[\"TotalCost\"], 2) . \" dollars.\";\n    }\n} else {\n    echo \"No results found.\";\n}\n\n$conn->close();\n?>\n```\n\n### Explanation of Pricing Strategies and Discounts\n\n1. **Bulk Purchase Discount (25% off):**\n   - If the customer buys 10 or more units of a product, they receive a 25% discount on that product. This encourages larger orders.\n\n2. **High-Value Item Discount (20% off):**\n   - For purchases where the quantity is 5 or more, and the individual product price exceeds $500, a 20% discount is applied. This aims to incentivize the purchase of premium products in larger quantities.\n\n3. **Medium Purchase Discount (10% off):**\n   - A 10% discount applies to orders of 3 or more units, where the product price is over $100. This is designed to encourage moderate purchases of mid-range items.\n\n4. **No Discount:**\n   - Products that do not meet the above criteria are sold at their regular price.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Error Handling:** Ensure proper error handling during database connection and query execution.\n- **Scalability:** This code can be easily adapted to accommodate additional products or pricing strategies by updating the SQL logic.\n- **Readability:** Use comments and structured code to enhance readability and maintainability.\n- **Formatting:** The `number_format()` function is used to format the total cost to two decimal places for better presentation.\n\nThis optimized code provides a flexible and efficient way to calculate the total cost of Apple products, considering various discount strategies based on purchase quantity and product price."
