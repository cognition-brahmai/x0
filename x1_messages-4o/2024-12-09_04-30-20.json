        "content": "The error message `'Tensor' object has no attribute '_keras_history'` typically indicates that there is an issue with how the layers are connected in your Keras model. This often happens when mixing TensorFlow operations (like `tf.reshape`) with Keras layers, as they may produce a TensorFlow tensor that is not properly tracked by Keras.\n\nHere's how you can resolve the issue and ensure your model is correctly set up:\n\n1. **Avoid using `tf.reshape` directly**: When you reshape tensors within a Keras model, use `keras.layers.Reshape` instead of `tf.reshape`. This ensures that the reshaping operation is tracked as part of the Keras model.\n\n2. **Check the shape compatibility**: Ensure that the dimensions of the tensors you're concatenating or reshaping are compatible. Your reshape operation needs to produce a shape that matches the expected input for subsequent layers.\n\nHere is a revised version of your code with the necessary changes:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense, LSTM, Dropout, Bidirectional, concatenate, Reshape\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Model\n\n# Define inputs\nAux_input = Input(shape=(wrd_temp.shape[1], 1), dtype='float32')  # shape (,200)\nMain_input = Input(shape=(wrdvec.shape[1],), dtype='float32')     # shape(,367)\n\n# Auxiliary branch\nX = Bidirectional(LSTM(20, return_sequences=True))(Aux_input)\nX = Dropout(0.2)(X)\nX = Bidirectional(LSTM(28, return_sequences=True))(X)\nX = Dropout(0.2)(X)\nX = Bidirectional(LSTM(28, return_sequences=False))(X)\nAux_Output = Dense(Opt_train.shape[1], activation='softmax')(X)  # total 22 classes\n\n# Concatenate and reshape\nx = concatenate([Main_input, Aux_Output])\nx = Reshape((389, 1))(x)  # Ensure this shape matches your intended configuration\n\n# Main branch\nx = Bidirectional(LSTM(20, return_sequences=True))(x)\nx = Dropout(0.2)(x)\nx = Bidirectional(LSTM(28, return_sequences=True))(x)\nx = Dropout(0.2)(x)\nx = Bidirectional(LSTM(28, return_sequences=False))(x)\nMain_Output = Dense(Opt_train.shape[1], activation='softmax')(x)\n\n# Build model\nmodel = Model(inputs=[Aux_input, Main_input], outputs=[Aux_Output, Main_Output])\n\n# Print model summary to verify architecture\nmodel.summary()\n```\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n- Ensure that the input shapes are correctly set when defining the `Input` layers, especially if your data shape has changed since the initial setup.\n- Double-check the shape of the tensors after each layer, especially after operations like `concatenate` and `Reshape`, to verify that they align with subsequent layer expectations.\n- Use `model.summary()` to print out the model architecture and confirm that each layer has the expected output shape.\n\nWith these changes, your code should be free from the `AttributeError` and function as intended."
