        "content": "The error message you're encountering is typically due to incorrect line endings in your `configure` script. It seems like the script has Windows-style line endings (CRLF, represented by `^M`) instead of Unix/Linux-style line endings (LF).\n\nTo fix this issue, you can convert the line endings of the `configure` script from Windows-style to Unix-style. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using `dos2unix` Command**:\n   - If you have `dos2unix` installed, you can easily convert the file by running:\n     ```bash\n     dos2unix configure\n     ```\n   - If `dos2unix` is not installed, you can install it using:\n     ```bash\n     yum install dos2unix\n     ```\n\n2. **Using `sed` Command**:\n   - If you prefer not to install additional packages, you can use `sed`:\n     ```bash\n     sed -i 's/\\r//' configure\n     ```\n\n3. **Using `tr` Command**:\n   - Another way is to use `tr` to remove the carriage return character:\n     ```bash\n     tr -d '\\r' < configure > configure.new\n     mv configure.new configure\n     ```\n\n4. **Using a Text Editor**:\n   - Open the `configure` script in a text editor that can handle different line endings (like `vim`, `nano`, or `gedit`).\n   - Change the line ending settings to Unix/Linux and save the file.\n\nAfter converting the line endings, try running the `./configure` command again. It should work without the bad interpreter error. If you encounter any more issues, feel free to ask for further assistance!"
