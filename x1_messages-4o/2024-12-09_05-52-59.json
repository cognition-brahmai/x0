I have a conditional statement in my code where I want to execute some code only if the tuple is not found in the list. However, it seems to not be working as expected. Here is the code snippet:\n\n```python\nif curr_x -1 > 0 and (curr_x-1 , curr_y) not in myList: \n    # Do Something\n```\n\nWhat could be wrong with this implementation?"

        "content": "Your implementation looks generally correct for checking if a tuple is not in a list of tuples. However, there are a few things you might want to check to ensure it's functioning as expected:\n\n1. **Check the Values**: Ensure that `curr_x` and `curr_y` are holding the values you expect them to. It might be helpful to print them out before the conditional statement to verify.\n\n2. **Data Type Consistency**: Make sure that `myList` is indeed a list of tuples and that the tuples are structured in the same way throughout your code. For example, `myList` should be initialized as something like `myList = [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ...]`.\n\n3. **Boundary Conditions**: In your condition `curr_x - 1 > 0`, consider if your logic requires `curr_x - 1 >= 0` instead, depending on whether you want to include 0 as a valid value. If the range of `curr_x` starts from 0, you might need to adjust this condition.\n\n4. **Loop Context**: If this condition is inside a loop, ensure that the loop is iterating over the correct range or elements.\n\n5. **Debugging**: You can add a debug print statement to see what exactly is being checked in the condition:\n\n    ```python\n    print(f\"Checking if ({curr_x-1}, {curr_y}) is not in {myList}\")\n    if curr_x - 1 > 0 and (curr_x - 1, curr_y) not in myList:\n        # Do Something\n    ```\n\n6. **List Contents**: Ensure `myList` is populated as expected and was not accidentally modified elsewhere in the code.\n\nIf after these checks the logic still doesn't seem to work, please provide more context or additional code snippets, and I can help troubleshoot further."
