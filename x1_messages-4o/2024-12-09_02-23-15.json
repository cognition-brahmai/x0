        "content": "I'm using the pyyaml library in Python 2.7.3 to dump an object to a file. The object contains several unicode strings. Previously, this has worked fine, but now it's producing output items that look like this: `'item': !!python/unicode \"some string\"`. However, I want the output to be `'item': 'some string'`. The command I currently use is: `yaml.dump(data,file(suite_out,'w'),encoding='utf-8',indent=4,allow_unicode=True)`. In other places in my code, I do the following and it works correctly: `codecs.open(suite_out,\"w\",\"utf-8\").write(yaml.dump(suite,indent=4,width=10000))`. What am I doing wrong?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to how PyYAML handles Unicode strings when dumping data. By default, PyYAML tries to preserve the data types, including distinguishing between regular strings and Unicode strings, which is why you're seeing the `!!python/unicode` tag. To produce output without these tags, you can use a representer to customize the output format. Here\u2019s how you can achieve that:\n\n```python\nimport yaml\nimport codecs\n\n# Define a representer to handle unicode conversion\ndef unicode_representer(dumper, data):\n    return dumper.represent_scalar('tag:yaml.org,2002:str', data)\n\n# Add the custom representer to handle Unicode strings\nyaml.add_representer(unicode, unicode_representer)\n\n# Your data object\ndata = {\n    'item1': u'some string',\n    'item2': u'another string'\n}\n\n# Write to file using codecs and yaml.dump\nwith codecs.open('output_file.yaml', 'w', 'utf-8') as file:\n    yaml.dump(data, file, indent=4, width=10000, allow_unicode=True)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Custom Representer**: By defining `unicode_representer`, we instruct PyYAML to treat Unicode strings as regular strings when dumping them. This avoids the `!!python/unicode` tag.\n\n2. **Adding Representer**: We add the custom representer to PyYAML's representers using `yaml.add_representer`.\n\n3. **File Writing**: Use `codecs.open` to ensure the file is opened with the correct encoding. This allows you to write Unicode content directly to the file without encoding issues.\n\nThis approach should give you the desired output format without the `!!python/unicode` tags."
