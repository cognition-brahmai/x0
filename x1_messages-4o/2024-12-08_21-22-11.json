        "content": "To tackle the problem of analyzing waste production data and developing a plan to reduce waste by at least 50% using Swift, you can follow a structured approach. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n### Step 1: Data Preprocessing\n1. **Data Collection**: Ensure you have the waste production data in a format that is accessible via Swift. This could be in a CSV, JSON, or database format.\n2. **Data Parsing**: Use Swift's Foundation framework to parse the data. For example, if the data is in CSV format, you can read and parse it into a usable structure like arrays or dictionaries.\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\n// Assuming CSV data is read into a string\nlet data = \"\"\"\nType,Weight\nPlastic,500\nPaper,300\nMetal,200\n\"\"\"\n\n// Parse the CSV data\nvar wasteData: [String: Double] = [:]\nlet lines = data.split(separator: \"\\n\")\nfor line in lines.dropFirst() {  // Drop header\n    let components = line.split(separator: \",\")\n    if let weight = Double(components[1]) {\n        wasteData[String(components[0])] = weight\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Data Analysis\n1. **Calculate Total Waste**: Sum up the waste for each type to get the total waste produced.\n2. **Identify Major Contributors**: Determine which types of waste contribute the most to the total waste.\n\n```swift\nlet totalWaste = wasteData.values.reduce(0, +)\nvar majorContributors: [String] = []\nfor (type, weight) in wasteData {\n    if weight / totalWaste > 0.1 {  // Example threshold for major contributors\n        majorContributors.append(type)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Develop Reduction Strategies\n1. **Research Reduction Methods**: For each major contributor, research possible methods to reduce waste. Consider recycling, reusing, reducing production, or switching to alternative materials.\n2. **Evaluate Cost-Effectiveness and Environmental Impact**: For each method, evaluate its cost-effectiveness and environmental impact. This step involves gathering additional data and may require external APIs or databases.\n\n### Step 4: Plan Formulation\n1. **Prioritize Methods**: Given the company\u2019s limited budget, prioritize methods that offer the highest reduction potential at the lowest cost and with the least environmental impact.\n2. **Set Reduction Targets**: Assign specific reduction targets for each waste type based on the chosen methods.\n\n### Step 5: Implementation Plan\n1. **Create an Action Plan**: Detail the steps required to implement each method, including timelines, responsibilities, and resource allocation.\n2. **Monitor and Adjust**: Implement a system to monitor waste reduction progress and make adjustments as necessary.\n\n### Example Swift Code for Strategy Evaluation\nHere is a hypothetical example of how you might structure some of this analysis in Swift:\n\n```swift\nstruct WasteReductionStrategy {\n    let type: String\n    let reductionPercentage: Double\n    let cost: Double\n    let environmentalImpact: String\n}\n\nvar strategies: [WasteReductionStrategy] = [\n    WasteReductionStrategy(type: \"Plastic\", reductionPercentage: 60, cost: 1000, environmentalImpact: \"Low\"),\n    WasteReductionStrategy(type: \"Paper\", reductionPercentage: 50, cost: 500, environmentalImpact: \"Medium\")\n]\n\n// Filter strategies based on cost and impact\nlet budget = 1500.0\nlet optimalStrategies = strategies.filter { $0.cost <= budget && $0.environmentalImpact == \"Low\" }\n```\n\n### Conclusion\nBy following this structured approach, you can effectively analyze waste production data and develop a comprehensive plan to reduce waste by at least 50% while considering cost-effectiveness and environmental impact. This plan should be continuously monitored and adjusted based on its effectiveness and any changes in company circumstances or external factors."
