Friend C's movie was released before any of the others, which means it was released in 2015.\n2. Friend B's movie has the highest rating, followed by Friend D's movie, then Friend A's movie, and finally Friend C's movie.\n\nUsing these clues, let's organize the information:\n\n- Friend C's movie is the lowest rated and was released in 2015.\n- Friend B's movie is the highest rated.\n\nSince Friend B's movie has the highest rating, it must be released the latest in 2018. \n\nNow, we have:\n\n- Friend C: 2015\n- Friend B: 2018\n\nNext, Friend D's movie is rated higher than Friend A's, so it must be released after Friend A's movie.\n\nThat leaves us with:\n\n- Friend A: 2016\n- Friend D: 2017\n\nPutting this all together, the order of the release dates from the highest to the lowest rated movie is:\n\n1. Friend B: 2018\n2. Friend D: 2017\n3. Friend A: 2016\n4. Friend C: 2015"
