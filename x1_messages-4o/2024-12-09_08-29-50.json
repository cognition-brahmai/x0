For example, I'm able to slice a 2D tensor X using X[:,1:], and a 3D tensor Y using Y[:,:,1:]. However, I'm unsure of how to approach this when the tensor Z has an unknown number of dimensions. The same problem also applies to numpy arrays."

        "content": "To index or slice the last dimension of a PyTorch tensor or a NumPy array when the number of dimensions is unknown, you can utilize Python's `Ellipsis` (`...`) object. This allows you to specify that you want to include all preceding dimensions without explicitly stating them, and then you can slice the last dimension.\n\nHere's how you can do it for both PyTorch tensors and NumPy arrays:\n\n### PyTorch\n\nFor a PyTorch tensor, you can use `...` to represent all preceding dimensions, and then slice the last dimension:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\n# Example tensor with an unknown number of dimensions\nZ = torch.randn(2, 3, 4, 5)  # This could have any number of dimensions\n\n# Slice the last dimension using Ellipsis\nsliced_Z = Z[..., 1:]\n\nprint(sliced_Z.shape)  # This will slice the last dimension\n```\n\n### NumPy\n\nSimilarly, for a NumPy array, you can use `...` to slice the last dimension:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Example array with an unknown number of dimensions\nZ = np.random.randn(2, 3, 4, 5)  # This could have any number of dimensions\n\n# Slice the last dimension using Ellipsis\nsliced_Z = Z[..., 1:]\n\nprint(sliced_Z.shape)  # This will slice the last dimension\n```\n\nIn both cases, `...` effectively replaces the need to specify each preceding dimension individually, allowing you to focus on slicing the last dimension regardless of how many dimensions the tensor or array has."
