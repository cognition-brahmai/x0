I understand that \"timedelta\" supports days (and weeks), while \"relativedelta\" supports periods defined in terms of years, months, weeks or days, as well as defining absolute values for year, month or day. However, I am only working with \"datetime.date\" objects and only interested in periods defined by the number of days. Is there any difference between \"timedelta\" and \"relativedelta\" in this context? Specifically, is there any difference between the two lines of code below?\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import date, timedelta\nfrom dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta\n\ni = -1  # This could have been any integer, positive or negative\nsomeday = date.today()\notherday = someday + timedelta(days=i)\notherday = someday + relativedelta(days=i)\n```"

        "content": "When working specifically with days and `datetime.date` objects, both `datetime.timedelta` and `dateutil.relativedelta.relativedelta` behave similarly in terms of adding or subtracting a specified number of days. For your specific use case of manipulating only days, there is no practical difference between using `timedelta` and `relativedelta`. Both lines of code will produce the same result:\n\n1. `otherday = someday + timedelta(days=i)`\n2. `otherday = someday + relativedelta(days=i)`\n\nHere's a breakdown of what happens:\n\n- **`timedelta`:** This is a straightforward way to represent a duration, which can be expressed in days (and other units like seconds, minutes, etc.). When you add a `timedelta` to a `datetime.date` object, it directly adjusts the date by the specified number of days.\n\n- **`relativedelta`:** Although more flexible and capable of handling more complex date manipulations (like adding months or years), when used with only the `days` argument, it behaves similarly to `timedelta`. It adjusts the given date by the number of days specified.\n\nIn summary, for operations involving only the addition or subtraction of days to a `datetime.date` object, `timedelta` and `relativedelta` are interchangeable, and you won't notice any difference in the results. However, `relativedelta` can be more powerful and flexible if you plan to extend your use case to involve more complex date manipulations in the future."
