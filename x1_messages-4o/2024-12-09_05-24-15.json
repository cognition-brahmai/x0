I am attempting to write a script that automates downloading files from FTP servers, and I want to display the progress of the download. Ideally, I'd like the output to stay in the same position, such as \"Downloading File FooFile.txt [47%]\". What I'm trying to avoid is something like this:\n\n    Downloading File FooFile.txt [47%]\n    Downloading File FooFile.txt [48%]\n    Downloading File FooFile.txt [49%]\n\nHow should I approach this problem?"

        "content": "To write output in the same place on the console in Python, you can use carriage return (`\\r`) to return the cursor to the beginning of the line, allowing you to overwrite the current line with new content. You'll want to ensure that the new content completely overwrites the old one, so it's important to manage the length of your strings accordingly.\n\nHere's how you can approach this problem:\n\n```python\nimport time\nimport sys\n\ndef download_file(file_name):\n    # Simulate downloading with a for loop and time.sleep\n    for progress in range(101):\n        # Print the progress with carriage return and flush the output\n        sys.stdout.write(f\"\\rDownloading File {file_name} [{progress}%]\")\n        sys.stdout.flush()\n\n        # Simulate some work being done\n        time.sleep(0.1)\n\n    # Print a new line after completion\n    print(\"\\nDownload complete!\")\n\n# Example usage\ndownload_file(\"FooFile.txt\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Carriage Return (`\\r`)**: This character moves the cursor back to the beginning of the line without advancing to the next line. When you use it in `sys.stdout.write()`, it allows you to overwrite the existing text in the console.\n\n2. **`sys.stdout.flush()`**: This is used to force the buffer to output the content immediately. It's necessary when you're overwriting output in the console to ensure that the new content is displayed promptly.\n\n3. **Fixed-Length Output**: Ensure the output string length remains consistent or is padded with spaces to fully overwrite the previous content. This avoids leftover characters from previous output, especially when progress percentage increases from 9% to 10%, for example.\n\n4. **Time Simulation**: In real scenarios, replace `time.sleep(0.1)` with your actual downloading logic. The sleep function is used here just to simulate the passage of time during download progress.\n\nBy following this approach, you can effectively display and update download progress on the same console line."
