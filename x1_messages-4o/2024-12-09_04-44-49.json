However, I've run into a problem: I expected each thread to complete its plotting task and then close, but this is not happening. If the code line that creates a figure is commented out, it runs as expected. Also, it behaves as intended when only one thread is spawned. Can someone help me understand why this is happening and how to fix it?\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport time\nimport Queue\nimport threading\n\ndef TapHistplots():\n    ##  for item in ['str1']:\n    # it behaves as expected if the line above is used instead of the one below\n    for item in ['str1','str2']:\n        otheritem = 1\n        TapHistQueue.put((item, otheritem))\n        makeTapHist().start()\n\nclass makeTapHist(threading.Thread):\n    def run(self):\n        item, otheritem = TapHistQueue.get()\n        fig = FigureQueue.get()\n        FigureQueue.put(fig+1)\n        print item+':'+str(fig)+'\\n',\n        time.sleep(1.3)\n        plt.figure(fig) # comment out this line and it behaves as expected\n        plt.close(fig)\n\nTapHistQueue = Queue.Queue(0)\nFigureQueue = Queue.Queue(0)\ndef main():\n    start = time.time()\n    \"\"\"Code in here runs only when this module is run directly\"\"\"\n    FigureQueue.put(1)\n    TapHistplots()\n    while threading.activeCount()>1:\n        time.sleep(1)\n        print 'waiting on %d threads\\n' % (threading.activeCount()-1),\n    print '%ds elapsed' % (time.time()-start)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering relates to how Matplotlib and threading interact. Matplotlib is not inherently thread-safe, which means its methods can cause unexpected behavior when called from multiple threads. Here are some strategies to help you resolve this problem:\n\n1. **Use a Thread-Safe Library**: Consider using `multiprocessing` instead of `threading`. This library is designed to circumvent the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and can safely manage separate processes. This approach allows each process to have its own memory space, avoiding conflicts with Matplotlib.\n\n2. **Use `concurrent.futures`**: If you are using Python 3.2 or higher, you can use the `concurrent.futures` module, which provides a higher-level interface for asynchronously executing callables.\n\n3. **Centralize Plotting**: If you must use threads, centralize the plotting to a single thread. You can use a thread-safe queue to send data to this single plotting thread.\n\nHere's an example using `multiprocessing`:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport time\nimport multiprocessing\n\ndef plot_figure(fig):\n    plt.figure(fig)\n    plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])  # Example plot\n    plt.title(f\"Figure {fig}\")\n    plt.savefig(f\"figure_{fig}.png\")\n    plt.close(fig)\n    print(f\"Completed plot for figure {fig}\")\n\ndef TapHistplots():\n    processes = []\n    for item in ['str1', 'str2']:\n        fig = FigureQueue.get()\n        FigureQueue.put(fig+1)\n        print(item + ':' + str(fig))\n        p = multiprocessing.Process(target=plot_figure, args=(fig,))\n        processes.append(p)\n        p.start()\n    \n    for p in processes:\n        p.join()\n\nFigureQueue = multiprocessing.Queue()\nFigureQueue.put(1)\n\ndef main():\n    start = time.time()\n    TapHistplots()\n    print('%ds elapsed' % (time.time() - start))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\nThis example uses `multiprocessing` to create separate processes for each plot. Each process handles its own instance of Matplotlib, which should resolve the thread-safety issue. Note that you'll need to manage the data flow and process synchronization to suit your specific application."
