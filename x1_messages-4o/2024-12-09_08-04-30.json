The error message I am getting is: 'dict' object does not support indexing. The query I am using is as follows:\n\n```\nsql = \"\"\"\n       SELECT DISTINCT u.name from user u\n        INNER JOIN city c ON u.city_id = c.id\n        WHERE c.designation=upper('fantasy') \n        AND c.id IN (select id from ref_geog where short_name LIKE '%opt')\n      \"\"\"\n\n# The last line in the above statement throws the error mentioned in the title. \n# However if the last line is change to:\n# AND c.id IN (select id from ref_geog where short_name = 'helloopt')\n# the script runs correctly.\n#\n# I also tried double escaping the '%' i.e. using '%%' instead - that generated the same error as previously.\n\nconnectDb()\nres = executeSql(sql)\nprint res\ncloseDbConnection()\n```\nThe error seems to be thrown at the last line of the query. However, when I change the last line to `AND c.id IN (select id from ref_geog where short_name = 'helloopt')`, the script runs correctly. I have also tried double escaping the '%' by using '%%', but that still generates the same error. \nThe function executeSql() simply invokes conn.execute(sql) and returns the results, and the variable conn is the previously established database connection. \nCan someone help me understand what's causing this error and how I can resolve it?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering seems to be related to how the SQLAlchemy `execute` function processes the query string. The issue is likely due to the way the '%' character is interpreted by SQLAlchemy's underlying database engine or the Python DBAPI. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Parameter Binding:**\n   SQLAlchemy might be interpreting the `%` character as a placeholder for parameter binding, which is common in some database backends. You should explicitly use parameter binding to avoid this issue. Modify your query to use a parameter for the pattern:\n\n   ```python\n   sql = \"\"\"\n       SELECT DISTINCT u.name from user u\n       INNER JOIN city c ON u.city_id = c.id\n       WHERE c.designation=upper('fantasy') \n       AND c.id IN (select id from ref_geog where short_name LIKE :pattern)\n   \"\"\"\n   \n   params = {'pattern': '%opt'}\n   ```\n\n   Then pass the `params` dictionary to the `executeSql` function:\n\n   ```python\n   res = executeSql(sql, params)\n   ```\n\n2. **Modify the `executeSql` function:**\n   Ensure your `executeSql` function is set up to accept parameters and pass them to the `conn.execute` method:\n\n   ```python\n   def executeSql(sql, params=None):\n       if params:\n           return conn.execute(sql, params)\n       else:\n           return conn.execute(sql)\n   ```\n\n3. **Use Raw SQL Execution:**\n   If you're using SQLAlchemy's `engine`, you can execute raw SQL directly, which might help bypass some of the ORM's query building:\n\n   ```python\n   from sqlalchemy import text\n\n   sql = \"\"\"\n       SELECT DISTINCT u.name from user u\n       INNER JOIN city c ON u.city_id = c.id\n       WHERE c.designation=upper('fantasy') \n       AND c.id IN (select id from ref_geog where short_name LIKE :pattern)\n   \"\"\"\n\n   with engine.connect() as conn:\n       res = conn.execute(text(sql), {'pattern': '%opt'})\n       for row in res:\n           print(row)\n   ```\n\nThese steps should help resolve the `TypeError` you are experiencing. Using parameter binding not only resolves potential issues with query parsing but also provides a layer of security against SQL injection attacks."
