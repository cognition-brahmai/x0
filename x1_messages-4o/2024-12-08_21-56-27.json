It's a captivating non-fiction book that tells the story of the University of Washington's rowing team and their journey to the 1936 Berlin Olympics. The book beautifully captures the essence of teamwork, perseverance, and the spirit of sportsmanship. It's an inspiring read for anyone interested in sports and history."
