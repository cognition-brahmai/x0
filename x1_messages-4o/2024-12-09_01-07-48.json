The Python interactive shell only understands Python code, and `pip install selenium` is a command meant to be run in the system command line or terminal, not in the Python shell.\n\nHere's how you can correctly install a package using pip:\n\n1. **Open your Command Line or Terminal**:\n   - On Windows, you can use Command Prompt or PowerShell.\n   - On macOS or Linux, you can use Terminal.\n\n2. **Run the pip install command**:\n   - Type the following command and press Enter:\n     ```\n     pip install selenium\n     ```\n\nThis command will install the Selenium package for your Python environment.\n\nIf you're using a virtual environment, make sure it is activated before running the `pip install` command to ensure that the package is installed in the correct environment.\n\nAdditionally, if you encounter any issues with permissions or need to install the package for a specific version of Python, you might need to run:\n- `python -m pip install selenium` for a specific Python version.\n- `pip3 install selenium` if you're using Python 3 on some systems where both Python 2 and Python 3 are installed."
