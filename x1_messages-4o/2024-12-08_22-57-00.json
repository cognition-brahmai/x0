        "content": "To implement a Python script that sends out automatic email notifications to customers stored in a MySQL database, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set Up the Environment**: Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed. You will need `mysql-connector-python` to interact with the MySQL database, `smtplib` for sending emails, and `email` for constructing the email messages.\n\n2. **Connect to the Database**: Use `mysql-connector-python` to connect to your MySQL database and retrieve customer data.\n\n3. **Compose the Email**: Use the `email` library to create an HTML formatted email.\n\n4. **Send the Email**: Use `smtplib` to send the email to each customer.\n\nBelow is a sample implementation of the script:\n\n```python\nimport mysql.connector\nimport smtplib\nfrom email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart\nfrom email.mime.text import MIMEText\n\n# Database connection\ndef get_customers():\n    try:\n        connection = mysql.connector.connect(\n            host='your_host',\n            database='your_database',\n            user='your_username',\n            password='your_password'\n        )\n        cursor = connection.cursor(dictionary=True)\n        cursor.execute(\"SELECT first_name, last_name, email FROM customers\")\n        customers = cursor.fetchall()\n        return customers\n    except mysql.connector.Error as err:\n        print(f\"Error: {err}\")\n    finally:\n        if connection.is_connected():\n            cursor.close()\n            connection.close()\n\n# Send email\ndef send_email(to_email, subject, content):\n    from_email = 'your_email@example.com'\n    from_password = 'your_email_password'\n\n    msg = MIMEMultipart('alternative')\n    msg['Subject'] = subject\n    msg['From'] = from_email\n    msg['To'] = to_email\n\n    # Record the MIME type of the email content\n    part = MIMEText(content, 'html')\n    msg.attach(part)\n\n    # Sending the email\n    try:\n        server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)\n        server.starttls()\n        server.login(from_email, from_password)\n        server.sendmail(from_email, to_email, msg.as_string())\n        server.quit()\n        print(f\"Email sent to {to_email}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Failed to send email to {to_email}: {e}\")\n\n# Main function\ndef main():\n    customers = get_customers()\n    for customer in customers:\n        first_name = customer['first_name']\n        last_name = customer['last_name']\n        email = customer['email']\n        \n        # Email content\n        subject = \"Hello from Our Company!\"\n        content = f\"\"\"\n        <html>\n        <body>\n            <p>Dear {first_name} {last_name},</p>\n            <p>Thank you for being a valued customer. We appreciate your business and look forward to serving you in the future.</p>\n            <p>Best regards,<br>Your Company Team</p>\n        </body>\n        </html>\n        \"\"\"\n        \n        send_email(email, subject, content)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Important Considerations:\n- **Security**: Ensure secure handling of credentials. It's better to use environment variables or secure vaults for storing sensitive information like database and email credentials.\n- **Error Handling**: The script should be robust enough to handle exceptions, such as database connection errors or email sending failures.\n- **Testing**: Test the script with a small set of data to ensure it works correctly before running it on the full customer list.\n- **Performance**: Consider batching the emails if dealing with a large number of customers to avoid server overload or hitting SMTP limits.\n\nThis script provides a basic framework for sending personalized emails using Python and SQL. Adjust the queries, email content, and settings to fit your specific requirements."
