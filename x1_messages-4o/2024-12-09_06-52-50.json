Currently, I'm running a query based on other ids and sometimes it returns no result, and consequently, the program crashes. Here is the query I'm running:\n\n```python\nsub_report_id = DBSession.query(TSubReport.ixSubReport).filter(and_(TSubReport.ixSection==sectionID[0], TSubReport.ixReport== reportID[0])).one()\n```\n\nWhen SQLAlchemy's `.one()` method finds no result, it raises a `NoResultFound` exception like this:\n\n```\nNoResultFound: No row was found for one()\n```\n\nIs there a way I can check if the result will be None and in case of no result, just skip the query?"

        "content": "To handle an empty result from a SQLAlchemy query using the `.one()` method without crashing your program, you can use a try-except block to catch the `NoResultFound` exception. This way, you can gracefully handle the situation where no result is found and take appropriate action, such as skipping the query or providing a default value.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to handle this scenario:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm.exc import NoResultFound\n\ntry:\n    sub_report_id = DBSession.query(TSubReport.ixSubReport).filter(\n        and_(TSubReport.ixSection == sectionID[0], TSubReport.ixReport == reportID[0])\n    ).one()\nexcept NoResultFound:\n    # Handle the case where no result is found\n    sub_report_id = None  # or take some other appropriate action\n    print(\"No result found, skipping the query or handling it accordingly.\")\n\n# You can now safely use `sub_report_id` knowing it may be None\nif sub_report_id is not None:\n    # Process the result if it was found\n    print(f\"Sub report ID: {sub_report_id}\")\nelse:\n    # Handle the absence of a result\n    print(\"No sub report ID found.\")\n```\n\nBy catching the `NoResultFound` exception, you ensure that your program doesn't crash when the query returns no results, and you can implement the necessary logic to handle such cases gracefully."
