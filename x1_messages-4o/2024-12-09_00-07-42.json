The incidence rate is calculated by dividing the number of cases by the population size, and then multiplying the result by 100,000 to adjust for the per 100,000 individuals scale.\n\nHere's the Excel formula you can use:\n\n1. Assume the \"Number of cases\" is in cell A2 and the \"Population size\" is in cell B2.\n2. In cell C2, you can enter the following formula to calculate the incidence rate per 100,000 individuals:\n\n   ```excel\n   = (A2 / B2) * 100000\n   ```\n\nThis formula will give you the incidence rate per 100,000 individuals for the data in row 2. You can then drag this formula down to calculate the incidence rate for additional rows of data in your table."
