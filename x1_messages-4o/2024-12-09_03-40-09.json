The `-c` argument in the command continues the download from where it left off if interrupted, `--read-timeout=5` gives up and tries again if no new data is received for over 5 seconds and `--tries=0` argument indicates that the function should retry forever. I'm unsure of where to begin in duplicating these features in my Python script."

        "content": "To create a Python function that replicates the functionality of the `wget` command with the specified options, you can use the `requests` library to handle HTTP requests and file downloads. Additionally, you'll need to handle retries and resuming the download manually. Here's a step-by-step guide and a sample implementation:\n\n1. **Install Required Libraries**: You need the `requests` library. Install it using pip if you haven't already:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\n2. **Function Implementation**: We'll create a function that handles downloading with retries, resuming, and timeout features.\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom time import sleep\n\ndef download_file(url, dest, timeout=5):\n    headers = {}\n    if os.path.exists(dest):\n        # Resume download by getting the file size\n        file_size = os.path.getsize(dest)\n        headers['Range'] = f'bytes={file_size}-'\n    else:\n        file_size = 0\n\n    while True:\n        try:\n            # Stream the request to handle large files\n            with requests.get(url, headers=headers, stream=True, timeout=timeout) as r:\n                r.raise_for_status()  # Raise an error on bad status\n                mode = 'ab' if file_size > 0 else 'wb'\n                with open(dest, mode) as f:\n                    for chunk in r.iter_content(chunk_size=8192):\n                        if chunk:  # filter out keep-alive new chunks\n                            f.write(chunk)\n                            f.flush()\n            print(\"Download completed successfully.\")\n            break\n        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n            print(f\"Error encountered: {e}. Retrying...\")\n            sleep(1)  # Optional: Add a delay between retries\n\n# Usage\nurl = \"http://example.com/largefile.zip\"\ndestination = \"largefile.zip\"\ndownload_file(url, destination)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Resuming Downloads**: We check if the destination file already exists and get its current size. We use this size to set the `Range` header, allowing the server to send only the remaining bytes.\n\n- **Retries**: The function is wrapped in a `while True` loop to keep retrying indefinitely if an exception occurs. You can modify this to limit the number of retries if desired.\n\n- **Timeout**: The `requests.get` method includes a `timeout` parameter to stop waiting for a response after the specified number of seconds. If the request times out, it raises an exception, which is caught and retried.\n\n- **Chunked Download**: Using `iter_content` with a reasonable chunk size allows downloading large files without using excessive memory.\n\nThis function should provide similar functionality to your specified `wget` command in Python. Adjust the parameters as needed for your specific use case."
