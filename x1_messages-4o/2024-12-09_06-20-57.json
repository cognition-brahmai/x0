Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, send_file\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/download')\ndef download_file():\n    path_to_file = 'path/to/your/table.csv'  # Specify the path to your file\n    return send_file(path_to_file, as_attachment=True, download_name='table.csv')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\nIn this example, when the user accesses the `/download` URL, the file located at `path/to/your/table.csv` will be sent as an attachment with the correct filename `table.csv`. The `as_attachment=True` part ensures that the file is downloaded as an attachment, and `download_name='table.csv'` specifies the name that should be used for the downloaded file."
