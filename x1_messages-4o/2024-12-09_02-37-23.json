Specifically, how does the optimizer know where to get the gradients of the loss without a call like 'optimizer.step(loss)'? When I minimize the loss, I don't have to pass the gradients to the optimizer. The code I'm using is as follows:\n```\nloss.backward() # Back Propagation\noptimizer.step() # Gradient Descent\n```"

        "content": "In PyTorch, the connection between the optimizer and the loss is established through the computational graph and the parameters of the model. Here's how it works in the code you provided:\n\n1. **Computational Graph**: When you perform operations on PyTorch tensors, a computational graph is dynamically created. This graph keeps track of the operations and their gradients. The loss is a result of operations on your model's outputs and targets, and it is part of this graph.\n\n2. **Gradient Calculation**: When you call `loss.backward()`, PyTorch computes the gradient of the loss with respect to each parameter in the model that requires gradients. This is done using backpropagation through the computational graph. These gradients are stored in the `.grad` attribute of each parameter.\n\n3. **Optimizer and Parameters**: The optimizer in PyTorch is initialized with the parameters of the model, e.g., `optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)`. This means the optimizer has access to all parameters of the model that it needs to update.\n\n4. **Optimizer Step**: When you call `optimizer.step()`, the optimizer updates the parameters of the model using the gradients stored in the `.grad` attribute of each parameter. The optimizer does not need to be explicitly told what the gradients are because they are already computed and stored during the `loss.backward()` call.\n\nSo, the connection is not explicit in the code you write for the optimizer. Instead, it is established through the computational graph and the model parameters that the optimizer is managing. The optimizer knows where to get the gradients from the `.grad` attribute of each parameter it is responsible for updating."
