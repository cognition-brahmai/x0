        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that your script is attempting to use a graphical backend that requires a display, which isn't available in your current environment (likely a headless server or a non-GUI environment).\n\nTo resolve this issue, you should ensure that the `Agg` backend is set before any other imports from `matplotlib`. This backend allows you to create plots without needing a display. Here's how you can modify your script to set the backend properly:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport matplotlib\nmatplotlib.use('Agg')  # Use the 'Agg' backend for rendering PNGs\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport networkx as nx\n\nG = nx.Graph()\nG.add_node(1)\nG.add_nodes_from([2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\nnx.draw(G)\nplt.savefig(\"/var/www/node.png\")\n```\n\nMake sure to place `matplotlib.use('Agg')` before importing `matplotlib.pyplot`. This change will ensure the script uses the non-interactive backend suitable for environments without a display server. \n\nAdditionally, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to write to the specified directory `/var/www/`. If the directory is not writable, choose another path or adjust the permissions accordingly."
