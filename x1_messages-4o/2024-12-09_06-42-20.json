        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"RuntimeError: Input, output and indices must be on the current device,\" typically occurs when some components of your data or model are not properly transferred to the same device (in this case, CUDA). Here's a checklist and some potential solutions to address this issue:\n\n1. **Verify Device Placement**:\n   Ensure that all components of your input data are moved to the correct device. You already have this line:\n   ```python\n   batch = tuple(b.to(device) for b in batch)\n   ```\n   This should move your input tensors to the specified device, so make sure `device` is set correctly, typically:\n   ```python\n   device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Model Device**:\n   Ensure that your model is also on the same device. You can set the model to the device using:\n   ```python\n   model.to(device)\n   ```\n\n3. **Check all Input Components**:\n   Double-check that all inputs to the model are on the same device. Sometimes, if you have additional components like token type IDs or position IDs, they also need to be transferred to the device.\n\n4. **Debugging**:\n   Insert debugging print statements before the line throwing the error to check where the issue might be:\n   ```python\n   print(batch[0].device, batch[1].device, batch[2].device)  # Check if all inputs are on 'cuda'\n   print(next(model.parameters()).device)  # Check if model is on 'cuda'\n   ```\n\n5. **Mismatch in DataLoader**:\n   Ensure that your `DataLoader` is not causing issues. Sometimes, if your dataset has components that aren't tensors, they might not be moved to the device. Make sure all batches are tensors and properly transferred.\n\n6. **Inspect Custom Layers or Components**:\n   If you've added any custom layers or components to your model, ensure they are also moved to the device using `.to(device)`.\n\n7. **Evaluate and Other Functions**:\n   If you have any other custom functions, such as `evaluate`, make sure they also handle device placement properly.\n\nIf you've checked all of the above and the error persists, try to isolate the issue by running each component separately to identify where the incompatibility arises. By carefully checking each part of your code with respect to device placement, you should be able to resolve the issue."
