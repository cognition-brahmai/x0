I found a script that generates a wide array of different colors across the RGB spectrum. Here's the script:\n\n```python\ndef random_color():\n    levels = range(32,256,32)\n    return tuple(random.choice(levels) for _ in range(3))\n```\n\nHowever, I want to modify this script to generate only three random colors, specifically red, green, and blue. How can I do this?"

        "content": "To modify the script to generate only the three primary colors\u2014red, green, and blue\u2014you need to adjust the function so that it returns a color that is either pure red, pure green, or pure blue. In the RGB color model, these colors are represented as follows:\n\n- Red: (255, 0, 0)\n- Green: (0, 255, 0)\n- Blue: (0, 0, 255)\n\nYou can achieve this by creating a list of these color tuples and randomly selecting one of them. Here's how you can modify the script:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef random_primary_color():\n    primary_colors = [(255, 0, 0), (0, 255, 0), (0, 0, 255)]\n    return random.choice(primary_colors)\n\n# Example usage\nfor _ in range(3):\n    print(random_primary_color())\n```\n\nThis function, `random_primary_color`, will randomly select one of the primary colors each time it is called. You can use this function to generate patterns using only red, green, and blue colors."
