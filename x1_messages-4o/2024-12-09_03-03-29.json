I want to group this dataframe by 'Company Name', and for each group, I want to calculate the total sum of the 'Amount' and count the number of 'Organisation Name'. I know how to do either one of these tasks using the groupby function in pandas, like so:\n\n```python\ndf.groupby('Company Name').sum()\ndf.groupby('Company Name').count()\n```\n\nBut, I'm not sure how to do both at the same time. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "You can achieve both tasks simultaneously using the `groupby` function in pandas along with the `agg` method, which allows you to apply multiple aggregation functions to different columns. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample dataframe\ndata = {\n    'Company Name': ['A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'C'],\n    'Organisation Name': ['Org1', 'Org2', 'Org3', 'Org1', 'Org2'],\n    'Amount': [100, 150, 200, 100, 250]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Group by 'Company Name' and calculate the sum of 'Amount' and count of 'Organisation Name'\nresult = df.groupby('Company Name').agg({\n    'Amount': 'sum',                    # Sum the 'Amount' column\n    'Organisation Name': 'count'        # Count the number of 'Organisation Name'\n})\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will give you a new DataFrame with the total sum of the 'Amount' and the count of 'Organisation Name' for each 'Company Name'. The `agg` method allows you to specify a dictionary where the keys are the column names and the values are the aggregation functions you want to apply."
