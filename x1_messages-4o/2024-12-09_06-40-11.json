        "content": "In Python, what does the `platforms` argument to `setup()` in `setup.py` do? I noticed some projects use `platforms` argument to `setup()` in `setup.py`, with only one value of `any`. For example,\n\n```python\n#setup.py file in project's package folder \n...   \nsetup(\n      ...,\n      platforms=['any'],\n      ...\n)\n```\nor \n\n```python\n#setup.py file in project's package folder\n...  \nsetup(\n      ...,\n      platforms='any',\n      ...\n)\n```\nFrom the name \"platforms\", I am guessing it implies the platform on which the package can run. However, I am unsure about the possible values to `platforms` and what it does/affects in the package. I have checked the setuptools docs but I failed to find any clear explanation. Can you explain or provide a link to an explanation of what it does exactly and what values it accepts? I've also tried to provide different values to it in my OS independent package and see what changes, when creating wheels, but it doesn't seem to affect anything."

        "content": "The `platforms` argument in the `setup()` function of `setup.py` is indeed intended to specify the platforms on which the package can run. However, this argument is mostly informational and does not affect the installation or operation of the package in any significant way.\n\nHere's a bit more detail on its purpose and usage:\n\n1. **Informational Purpose**: The `platforms` argument is primarily used to inform users and other developers about the intended platforms for the package. This information can be helpful when browsing package metadata, for instance, on PyPI or when generating documentation.\n\n2. **Accepted Values**: The `platforms` argument can take a list or a single string, indicating the platforms. Common values include:\n   - `'any'`: Indicates that the package is platform-independent and can run on any platform.\n   - Specific platforms like `'win32'`, `'linux'`, `'macosx'`, etc., if the package is designed to work only on those platforms.\n\n3. **Impact on Package Installation**: As you have observed, specifying different values for the `platforms` argument does not affect how the package is installed or built. It is not used by setuptools or pip to enforce any constraints on where the package can be installed. This means that even if you specify a specific platform, the package can still technically be installed on any system.\n\n4. **Usage in Practice**: Many projects simply specify `'any'` to indicate cross-platform compatibility. If a package is truly platform-specific, it might be more common to use other mechanisms to enforce this, such as specifying platform-specific dependencies or using conditional logic within the package itself.\n\nOverall, the `platforms` argument is a metadata field that serves to convey information rather than enforce any restrictions or behaviors in the package management process."
