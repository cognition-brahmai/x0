The commands `pip update` and `pip upgrade` don't exist, which is why they didn't work for you. Here is how you can upgrade a package:\n\n1. Open your terminal or command prompt.\n2. Use the following command to upgrade a specific package:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade package_name\n   ```\n\n   Replace `package_name` with the name of the package you want to upgrade.\n\nFor example, if you want to upgrade the `requests` package, you would run:\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade requests\n```\n\nIf you want to upgrade all installed packages, you can use a combination of commands. Here\u2019s one way to do it on Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS):\n\n```bash\npip list --outdated --format=freeze | grep -v '^\\-e' | cut -d = -f 1 | xargs -n1 pip install -U\n```\n\nAnd on Windows, you can do something similar using PowerShell:\n\n```bash\npip list --outdated --format=freeze | ForEach-Object {pip install --upgrade $_.Split('==')[0]}\n```\n\nRemember that for some packages, you might need administrative privileges, so you may need to run your terminal as an administrator or use `sudo` on Unix-based systems."
