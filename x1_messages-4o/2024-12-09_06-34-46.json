When I compiled all the examples except for simpleMPI without error and ran `./devicequery`, I encountered the CUDA Runtime API error 38: no CUDA-capable device is detected. What could be the cause of this error?\n\nI have tried all the recommendations from CUDA-capable device but nothing has worked. I have verified that `/dev/nvidia*` is present with permissions set to 666 (crw-rw-rw-) and owner root:root. I have also tried executing the code with sudo and I am aware that CUDA 5.0 installs driver and libraries at the same time.\n\nAdditionally, when I run `nvidia-smi -a`, I get an API mismatch error. How could this happen if I used the CUDA 5.0 installer to install the driver and libs at the same time? Could the old 4.2 version be causing the problem?"

        "content": "The issues you're experiencing with the GPU on your Ubuntu 12.04 system could be due to a number of factors. Let's break down possible causes and solutions:\n\n1. **Driver Version Mismatch**: The error message about an API mismatch suggests that there may be a conflict between different versions of the NVIDIA driver. Even though you installed CUDA 5.0, which includes a specific driver version, remnants of the previous CUDA 4.2 installation could be causing conflicts. You should:\n\n   - Completely uninstall any existing NVIDIA drivers and CUDA installations. You can do this by using:\n     ```\n     sudo apt-get remove --purge '^nvidia-.*'\n     sudo apt-get remove --purge '^cuda-.*'\n     ```\n   - After purging, you can also remove the residual configuration files:\n     ```\n     sudo apt-get autoremove\n     sudo apt-get autoclean\n     ```\n   - Reinstall CUDA 5.0, ensuring that the installation process completes without errors.\n\n2. **Kernel Module Issues**: Ensure that the NVIDIA kernel module is properly loaded. You can check if the module is loaded using:\n   ```\n   lsmod | grep nvidia\n   ```\n   If it's not present, you might need to load it manually:\n   ```\n   sudo modprobe nvidia\n   ```\n   If there are errors when loading the module, it might indicate a compatibility issue with the kernel.\n\n3. **Compatibility Issues**: Check that the GTX 670 is supported by the driver version bundled with CUDA 5.0. You might need to upgrade to a later CUDA version that explicitly supports the GTX 670, or alternatively, download a compatible driver from the NVIDIA website and install it separately.\n\n4. **Library Path Configuration**: Ensure that your environment variables are set correctly to point to the CUDA 5.0 libraries. Add the following lines to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:\n   ```sh\n   export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-5.0/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}\n   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-5.0/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}\n   ```\n   After editing, reload the profile with `source ~/.bashrc`.\n\n5. **Check for Conflicting Drivers**: Sometimes, Nouveau (the open-source NVIDIA driver) can conflict with the proprietary NVIDIA driver. Ensure that Nouveau is disabled by adding it to the blacklist:\n   ```\n   echo \"blacklist nouveau\" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n   sudo update-initramfs -u\n   ```\n\n6. **Reboot**: After making these changes, reboot your system to ensure that all configurations are applied correctly.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with the CUDA runtime environment and get the GTX 670 recognized as a CUDA-capable device. If problems persist, consider checking system logs (`dmesg`, `/var/log/syslog`) for more detailed error messages that can provide further insights."
