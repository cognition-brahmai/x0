        "content": "To assign appropriate numerical values to the responses for data analysis, you can use a binary encoding system. This is a common practice in data analysis to transform categorical data into numerical values that can be easily processed and analyzed. Here's how you can assign values:\n\n- Assign a value of **1** to \"Yes\" responses, indicating that the respondent likes apple pie.\n- Assign a value of **0** to \"No\" responses, indicating that the respondent does not like apple pie.\n\nThis binary encoding allows for straightforward statistical analysis, such as calculating the proportion of respondents who like apple pie or performing more complex statistical tests. For example, if you wanted to calculate the percentage of people who like apple pie, you would sum the \"Yes\" responses (count the 1s) and divide by the total number of respondents, then multiply by 100 to get a percentage."
