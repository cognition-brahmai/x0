Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Use a Form Element**: If this input is part of a form, wrap it in a `<form>` element for better semantics and structure.\n\n2. **Add Accessibility Features**: Ensure accessibility by using the `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attributes, although the `for` attribute in the label is already quite effective.\n\n3. **CSS Classes**: Add CSS classes for styling, which can help separate structure from presentation.\n\n4. **Self-Closing Tags**: Although not mandatory, you can use self-closing tags for XHTML compatibility, like `<input />`.\n\nHere's a revised version incorporating some of these suggestions:\n\n```html\n<form>\n    <div class=\"form-group\">\n        <label for=\"firstName\" class=\"form-label\">First Name</label>\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"firstName\" id=\"firstName\" class=\"form-input\" aria-labelledby=\"firstNameLabel\">\n    </div>\n</form>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Form Element**: Encapsulating the input within a `<form>` provides context if this is part of a data submission process.\n- **CSS Classes**: `form-group`, `form-label`, and `form-input` can be used for styling. This makes your HTML cleaner and your CSS more organized.\n- **Accessibility**: Using `aria-labelledby` can improve accessibility for screen readers, especially if the label text is not directly adjacent to the input.\n\nThese changes don't necessarily make the HTML \"more efficient\" in terms of performance but improve its maintainability, readability, and accessibility."
