        "content": "To disable interaction with a master frame (or window) in Tkinter when a popup `Toplevel` window is active, you can use the `grab_set()` method on the `Toplevel` window. This method ensures that all events are directed to the `Toplevel` window until it is closed, effectively preventing interaction with other windows.\n\nHere's a simple example to illustrate how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\nfrom tkinter import Toplevel\n\ndef open_popup():\n    # Create a Toplevel window\n    popup = Toplevel(root)\n    popup.title(\"Popup Window\")\n    popup.geometry(\"200x100\")\n    \n    # Make the Toplevel window modal\n    popup.grab_set()\n\n    # Add a label and a button to close the popup\n    label = tk.Label(popup, text=\"This is a popup window\")\n    label.pack(pady=10)\n    \n    close_button = tk.Button(popup, text=\"Close\", command=popup.destroy)\n    close_button.pack()\n\n# Create the main application window\nroot = tk.Tk()\nroot.title(\"Main Window\")\nroot.geometry(\"300x200\")\n\n# Add a button to open the popup\nopen_button = tk.Button(root, text=\"Open Popup\", command=open_popup)\nopen_button.pack(pady=20)\n\n# Start the Tkinter event loop\nroot.mainloop()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **`Toplevel` Window:** We create a `Toplevel` window named `popup`.\n2. **`grab_set()` Method:** This method is called on the `popup` window, which makes it modal. While the `popup` window is open, the user won't be able to interact with the main window (`root`).\n3. **Closing the Popup:** The popup can be closed using the \"Close\" button, which destroys the `popup` window and releases the grab, returning control to the main window.\n\nWith this setup, all user interactions are captured by the popup until it is closed, preventing any interaction with the main window."
