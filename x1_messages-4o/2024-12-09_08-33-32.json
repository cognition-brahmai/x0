        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to differences in how octal numbers are represented in Python 2 versus Python 3. In Python 2, octal numbers were denoted with a leading zero, like `010`. However, in Python 3, this notation was changed to avoid confusion and potential errors.\n\nIn Python 3, you should use the prefix `0o` (zero followed by a lowercase 'o') to indicate an octal number. Here's how you can define an octal number in Python 3:\n\n```python\na = 0o10\nprint(a)  # This will print 8 because 0o10 is the octal representation of the decimal number 8.\n```\n\nIf you use the `0o` prefix, your code should work without any syntax errors."
