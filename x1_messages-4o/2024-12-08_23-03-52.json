Since 4 is smaller than 7, 4 comes before 7.\n   - Compare 4 and 11. Since 4 is smaller, 4 stays first.\n   - Compare 7 and 11. Since 7 is smaller, it comes before 11.\n\n3. **Arrange in Order**:\n   - The smallest number is 4, so it comes first.\n   - The next smallest number is 7, so it comes second.\n   - The largest number is 11, so it comes last.\n\n4. **Write the Numbers**: Arrange them in the order determined: 4, 7, 11.\n\nTherefore, the integers in ascending order are 4, 7, and 11."
