I created a venv using Python 3.6 on my MacOS in the folder `/Users/kim/Documents/Apps/PythonApps/python36-miros-a3`. After activating the virtual environment, I ran `pip install pylint`. My workspace is in `/Users/kim/Documents/Apps/WebApps/miros-a3`. In my VSCode workspace settings, I have the following configuration:\n\n```\n{\n    \"folders\": [\n        {\n            \"path\": \".\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"settings\": {\n        \"python.pythonPath\": \"/Users/kim/Documents/Apps/PythonApps/python36-miros-a3/bin/python3.6\",\n        \"python.venvPath\": \"/Users/kim/Documents/Apps/PythonApps\"\n    }\n}\n```\nDespite trying to set a custom path for pylint and changing the venvpath, pylint is still complaining about the import statement saying it does not exist, even though the files are in the same folder and I can execute my python files. I have also tried turning on the virtual environment from the command line and then typing `code` to activate VSCode, as well as using the troubleshooting guide provided at `https://donjayamanne.github.io/pythonVSCodeDocs/docs/troubleshooting_linting/`. How can I avoid these false positive import errors?"

        "content": "Dealing with pylint false positives related to import errors in a virtual environment can be frustrating, but there are several steps you can take to resolve this issue in Visual Studio Code:\n\n1. **Verify Python Path**: Ensure that your VSCode is using the correct Python interpreter. Go to the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`), type `Python: Select Interpreter`, and ensure that the interpreter from your virtual environment is selected. It should be `/Users/kim/Documents/Apps/PythonApps/python36-miros-a3/bin/python3.6`.\n\n2. **Configure VSCode Settings**:\n   - Open your workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json`) and make sure it includes:\n     ```json\n     {\n         \"python.pythonPath\": \"/Users/kim/Documents/Apps/PythonApps/python36-miros-a3/bin/python3.6\",\n         \"python.linting.pylintArgs\": [\n             \"--init-hook\",\n             \"import sys; sys.path.append('/Users/kim/Documents/Apps/WebApps/miros-a3')\"\n         ]\n     }\n     ```\n     This configuration adds your workspace directory to the `sys.path`, which helps pylint recognize the imports.\n\n3. **Install Dependencies in Virtual Environment**: Ensure all your project's dependencies are installed within your virtual environment. Activate the virtual environment and run:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r /path/to/your/requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n4. **Ensure Consistent Linting Configuration**:\n   - Create a `.pylintrc` file in your project root directory (if you don't have one already) and customize it to exclude specific directories or suppress certain warnings/errors as needed.\n\n5. **Verify PYTHONPATH Environment Variable**:\n   - You can set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable in your terminal to include your project directory before starting VSCode:\n     ```bash\n     export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/Users/kim/Documents/Apps/WebApps/miros-a3\n     code .\n     ```\n\n6. **Use VSCode Terminal**:\n   - When opening VSCode, ensure you are doing so from a terminal that has the virtual environment activated. This helps VSCode inherit the correct environment variables.\n\n7. **Update VSCode and Extensions**:\n   - Ensure that both VSCode and the Python extension for VSCode are up to date, as updates might resolve existing bugs and improve compatibility.\n\nIf you've tried all of the above and still face issues, consider disabling pylint temporarily to see if the problem lies with the linter itself or other configurations. Additionally, sometimes issues can be resolved by simply restarting VSCode after making changes to settings or configurations."
