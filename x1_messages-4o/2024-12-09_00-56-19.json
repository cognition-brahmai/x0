I have two variables that are supposed to be strings and I want to verify that only one of them contains a True value (i.e., is not None or an empty string). However, the '^' operator seems to be bitwise and is not defined on all objects. How can I perform this operation?\n\nCode:\n```python\nstr1 = raw_input(\"Enter string one:\")\nstr2 = raw_input(\"Enter string two:\")\nif logical_xor(str1, str2):\n    print \"ok\"\nelse:\n    print \"bad\"\n```\n\nWhen I try to use the '^' operator, I get the following error:\n```python\n>>> 1 ^ 1\n0\n>>> 2 ^ 1\n3\n>>> \"abc\" ^ \"\"\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for ^: 'str' and 'str'\n```"

        "content": "In Python, the `^` operator is indeed a bitwise XOR operator and is typically used with integers. For logical operations like XOR on non-integer types, you need to implement the logic manually.\n\nThe logical XOR can be defined as \"true if exactly one of the operands is true.\" For your specific use case, where you want to check that only one of the two string variables is not `None` or an empty string, you can define a function like this:\n\n```python\ndef logical_xor(str1, str2):\n    # Convert strings to boolean: True if they are not None and not empty\n    bool1 = bool(str1)\n    bool2 = bool(str2)\n    # Return True if exactly one of them is True\n    return bool1 != bool2\n\nstr1 = input(\"Enter string one:\")  # Use input() instead of raw_input() in Python 3\nstr2 = input(\"Enter string two:\")\n\nif logical_xor(str1, str2):\n    print(\"ok\")\nelse:\n    print(\"bad\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `logical_xor` converts the strings to boolean values. Non-empty strings evaluate to `True`, and empty strings or `None` evaluate to `False`.\n- The XOR operation is implemented using `!=`, which effectively checks if the boolean values are different.\n- This function returns `True` if one and only one of the strings is non-empty.\n\nThis solution will work correctly in both Python 2 and Python 3, but note that `raw_input()` is replaced by `input()` in Python 3."
