For instance, I tried deleting the 'cos' function from the 'math' module and re-importing the module, but the 'cos' function was still missing. Why does Python behave this way and where does it store this information? Can I access or change it?\n\nHere is the code I executed:\n```python\nimport math\n\nmath.cos(0)\ndel math.cos\n\ntry:\n    math.cos(0)\nexcept AttributeError as e:\n    print(str(e))\n\ndel math\n\ntry:\n    math.cos(0)\nexcept NameError as e:\n    print(str(e))\n\nimport math\n\ntry:\n    math.cos(0)\nexcept AttributeError as e:\n    print(str(e))\n```\n\nThe output was:\n```\nmodule 'math' has no attribute 'cos'\nname 'math' is not defined\nmodule 'math' has no attribute 'cos'\n```\nThis suggests that Python remembers the 'cos' function was deleted from the 'math' module, even after the whole module was deleted and re-imported."

        "content": "The behavior you're encountering is due to Python's module caching mechanism. When you import a module, Python checks if the module is already present in the `sys.modules` dictionary, which acts as a cache for all the imported modules. If the module is found there, Python uses the cached version instead of reloading the module from scratch.\n\nHere's what's happening step-by-step in your case:\n\n1. When you first import the `math` module, it gets loaded into `sys.modules`.\n\n2. The `del math.cos` statement removes the `cos` function from the `math` module in the current session.\n\n3. When you delete the `math` module with `del math`, you're only removing the reference to the module from your local namespace, but it still exists in `sys.modules`.\n\n4. When you re-import the `math` module, Python uses the cached version from `sys.modules` where `cos` has already been deleted.\n\nTo completely reload the module and clear the cached version, you can use the `importlib.reload` function from the `importlib` module in Python's standard library:\n\n```python\nimport importlib\nimport math\n\n# Modify the math module\nmath.cos(0)\ndel math.cos\n\n# Delete the reference\ndel math\n\n# Use importlib.reload to ensure a fresh import\nimport math\nimportlib.reload(math)\n\n# Now math.cos should be available again\ntry:\n    print(math.cos(0))  # Should work without raising an error\nexcept AttributeError as e:\n    print(str(e))\n```\n\nBy using `importlib.reload`, Python will reload the `math` module from scratch, restoring all its original attributes. Note that this approach works for pure Python modules, but for built-in modules like `math`, the behavior may still depend on the implementation and Python version you are using."
