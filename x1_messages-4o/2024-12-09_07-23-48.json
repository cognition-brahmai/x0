        "content": "How can I convert a grayscale OpenCV image to black and white using OpenCV 2.3? I am trying to create a binary mask where anything not absolutely black turns white, so that I can use this mask to ignore keypoints found on the edge of the black mask area in surf.detect() function. However, I am having trouble with the threshold value parameter in the Threshold() function. No matter what value I set the threshold to (0, 16, 128, or 255), the result is always the same, with all pixels with a value greater than 128 becoming white and everything else becoming black. Here is the Python code I am working with:\n\n```python\nimport cv, cv2\nfn = 'myfile.jpg'\nim_gray = cv2.imread(fn, cv.CV_LOAD_IMAGE_GRAYSCALE)\nim_gray_mat = cv.fromarray(im_gray)\nim_bw = cv.CreateImage(cv.GetSize(im_gray_mat), cv.IPL_DEPTH_8U, 1);\nim_bw_mat = cv.GetMat(im_bw)\nthreshold = 0 # 128#255# HAS NO EFFECT!?!?\ncv.Threshold(im_gray_mat, im_bw_mat, threshold, 255, cv.CV_THRESH_BINARY | cv.CV_THRESH_OTSU);\ncv2.imshow('', np.asarray(im_bw_mat))\ncv2.waitKey()\n```\n\nWhat could I be doing wrong?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to the use of the `cv.CV_THRESH_OTSU` flag in the `cv.Threshold` function. When you use the Otsu's method (`cv.CV_THRESH_OTSU`), it automatically determines the optimal threshold value, effectively overriding any threshold value you specify.\n\nTo fix your code and manually set the threshold value, you should remove the `cv.CV_THRESH_OTSU` flag. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport cv2\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load the image in grayscale\nfn = 'myfile.jpg'\nim_gray = cv2.imread(fn, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)\n\n# Convert the grayscale image to binary (black and white)\nthreshold = 128 # Set your desired threshold value here\n_, im_bw = cv2.threshold(im_gray, threshold, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)\n\n# Display the result\ncv2.imshow('Binary Image', im_bw)\ncv2.waitKey(0)\ncv2.destroyAllWindows()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Threshold Value**: You can adjust the `threshold` variable to the value you want. This will determine the cutoff point for converting grayscale to black and white.\n2. **Threshold Function**: Use the `cv2.threshold` function without Otsu's method to manually specify the threshold.\n3. **Display**: Use `cv2.imshow` to display the processed image and `cv2.waitKey(0)` to wait indefinitely until a key is pressed.\n\nThis code will convert the grayscale image to a binary image based on the threshold value you specify, allowing you to create a mask where everything not absolutely black becomes white."
