I want to create a subclass 'SubThing' that inherits from 'Thing' and adds a 'time' attribute. Here is the code I have so far:\n\n```python\nclass Thing():\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n\nclass SubThing(Thing):\n    # something here to extend the init and add a \"time\" property\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return '<%s %s>' % (self.name, self.time)\n```\n\nCould you provide some guidance on how to do this?"

        "content": "To extend the `__init__` method in a subclass, you'll need to call the `__init__` method of the base class using `super()`. This ensures that the subclass inherits and initializes the attributes of the base class before adding any new attributes specific to the subclass.\n\nHere's how you can modify your `SubThing` class to include a `time` attribute:\n\n```python\nclass Thing():\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n\nclass SubThing(Thing):\n    def __init__(self, name, time):\n        super().__init__(name)  # Call the __init__ method of the base class\n        self.time = time        # Add the new attribute specific to SubThing\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return '<%s %s>' % (self.name, self.time)\n\n# Example usage\nsubthing_instance = SubThing(\"ExampleName\", \"12:00\")\nprint(subthing_instance)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- The `super().__init__(name)` line calls the `__init__` method of the base class `Thing`, passing the `name` parameter to it.\n- The `self.time = time` line adds the `time` attribute to the `SubThing` class, allowing you to store and manage additional data specific to `SubThing`.\n\nThis way, when you create an instance of `SubThing`, it will have both `name` and `time` attributes."
