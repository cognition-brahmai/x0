The pattern must be symmetrical, with 6 blocks on each side of the board. The rules are as follows:\n- The red block must be in the center of the board.\n- The orange block must be to the left of the red block, and the green block must be to the right of the red block.\n- The blue block must be directly below the red block, with the purple block directly below the orange block and the yellow block directly below the green block.\n- The remaining 6 blocks can be arranged in any order, as long as they form a symmetrical pattern on both sides of the board.\nCan you solve this puzzle and create the correct pattern?"

        "content": "To solve this puzzle, let's arrange the blocks according to the given rules and create a symmetrical pattern:\n\n1. **Center of the Board:**\n   - Red block\n\n2. **Right and Left of the Red Block:**\n   - Orange block on the left\n   - Green block on the right\n\n3. **Directly Below Each of These Blocks:**\n   - Below the red block: Blue block\n   - Below the orange block: Purple block\n   - Below the green block: Yellow block\n\nNow, we have used 6 blocks: Red, Orange, Green, Blue, Purple, and Yellow.\n\n4. **Remaining Blocks:**\n   We have 6 blocks left to arrange symmetrically. Let's denote these blocks as A, B, C, D, E, and F. These can be any colors that you have left.\n\n5. **Symmetrical Placement:**\n   - Place blocks A, B, and C on the left side.\n   - Place blocks D, E, and F on the right side.\n\nThe board will look like this:\n\n```\n[ A ] [Orange] [Red] [Green] [ D ]\n[ B ] [Purple] [Blue] [Yellow] [ E ]\n[ C ]                     [ F ]\n```\n\nThis setup maintains symmetry, with the specified blocks in their required positions, and the remaining blocks matched symmetrically across the center."
