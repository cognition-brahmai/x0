        "content": "The phrase \"alone together\" is considered an oxymoron because it combines contradictory terms. \"Alone\" implies being by oneself, without the presence of others, while \"together\" suggests being in the company of others. When paired, the two words create a paradoxical situation where people are simultaneously solitary and in a group. This phrase is often used to describe scenarios where individuals are physically present with others but feel isolated or disconnected, such as when people are focused on their devices instead of interacting with each other."
