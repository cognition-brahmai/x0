Here's how you can check if all the values in the sequence are integers:\n\n```python\nmy_sequence = (2, 5, 7, 82, 35)\nall_int = all(type(i) is int for i in my_sequence)\n\nif all_int:\n    do()\n```\n\nIn this code, `all()` takes a generator expression `(type(i) is int for i in my_sequence)` and returns `True` if all elements in the sequence are integers, otherwise it returns `False`. This way, you can achieve the desired check in one concise line."
