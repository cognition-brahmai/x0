        "content": "In Nathaniel Hawthorne's \"The Scarlet Letter,\" the changing colors of the rose embroidered by Hester serve as a symbolic representation of her evolving emotions and character development throughout the story.\n\n1. **Deep Crimson (Initial Color)**: At the beginning, the rose is described as a deep crimson color. According to the clues, the darker the color, the less guilty Hester feels about her sin. This initial deep crimson might suggest that at this point, Hester does not feel the weight of guilt as heavily. It could indicate a sense of defiance or acceptance of her actions, as she has yet to endure the full extent of public shaming and internal reflection.\n\n2. **Lighter Pink (After Public Shaming)**: After Hester is publicly shamed, the rose becomes a lighter shade of pink. This change signifies an increase in the guilt she feels about her sin. The public humiliation and the burden of wearing the scarlet letter \"A\" have made her more aware of her societal transgression and its repercussions, leading to a deeper internalization of guilt and shame. This lighter color reflects her vulnerability and the emotional turmoil she experiences during this period.\n\n3. **Deeper Red (Towards the End)**: Towards the end of the story, the rose returns to a deeper shade of red. This suggests a reduction in the guilt Hester feels, likely due to her personal growth and acceptance over time. By this point, Hester has undergone significant character development, finding strength and resilience despite her circumstances. The deeper red may symbolize her reconciliation with her past and her ability to redefine her identity beyond her sin.\n\nOverall, the changing colors of the rose highlight Hester's emotional journey from initial defiance or acceptance, through deep guilt and shame, to eventual reconciliation and inner strength. This progression underscores her complex character development as she navigates the challenges imposed by her society and her own conscience."
