I have an array of lists of numbers in the following format: \n```python\n[0] (0.01, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.03)\n[1] (0.00, 0.02, 0.02, 0.03, 0.02)\n[2] (0.01, 0.02, 0.02, 0.03, 0.02)\n     ...\n[n] (0.01, 0.00, 0.01, 0.05, 0.03)\n```\nTo calculate the mean, I have been looping through the array, summing the value at a given index of a list, and then dividing each value in my \"averages list\" by `n`. To calculate the standard deviation, I loop through the array again, after I have calculated the mean. I'm looking for a more efficient method that only requires going through the array once. Can you provide a solution in an interpreted language, such as Perl or Python, or pseudocode?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can calculate the mean and standard deviation in a single pass through the array by using an online algorithm approach. This method involves keeping track of both the sum and sum of squares for each index as you iterate through the array. Here's how you can do it in Python:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_mean_and_std(data):\n    n = len(data)\n    if n == 0:\n        return [], []\n\n    length_of_tuples = len(data[0])\n    means = [0] * length_of_tuples\n    sum_of_squares = [0] * length_of_tuples\n\n    for entry in data:\n        for i in range(length_of_tuples):\n            means[i] += entry[i]\n            sum_of_squares[i] += entry[i] ** 2\n\n    for i in range(length_of_tuples):\n        means[i] /= n\n\n    std_devs = [0] * length_of_tuples\n    for i in range(length_of_tuples):\n        variance = (sum_of_squares[i] / n) - (means[i] ** 2)\n        std_devs[i] = variance ** 0.5\n\n    return means, std_devs\n\n# Example usage:\ndata = [\n    (0.01, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.03),\n    (0.00, 0.02, 0.02, 0.03, 0.02),\n    (0.01, 0.02, 0.02, 0.03, 0.02),\n    (0.01, 0.00, 0.01, 0.05, 0.03)\n]\n\nmeans, std_devs = calculate_mean_and_std(data)\nprint(\"Means:\", means)\nprint(\"Standard Deviations:\", std_devs)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Initialization**: Start by initializing two lists, `means` and `sum_of_squares`, to store the cumulative sum and sum of squares for each index.\n- **First Pass**: As you iterate over each entry in the data, update `means` by adding the current values and `sum_of_squares` by adding the square of the values.\n- **Calculate Means**: After processing all entries, divide each cumulative sum in `means` by the total number of entries `n` to get the mean for each index.\n- **Calculate Standard Deviations**: Use the formula for variance: `variance = (sum_of_squares / n) - (mean**2)` and then take the square root to obtain the standard deviation for each index.\n\nThis method is efficient as it only requires a single pass through the data, maintaining O(n) complexity."
