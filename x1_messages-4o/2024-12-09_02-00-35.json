The code is as follows: \n\n```python\nlistoflists = []\nlist = []\nfor i in range(0,10):\n    list.append(i)\n    if len(list)>3:\n        list.remove(list[0])\n        listoflists.append((list, list[0]))\nprint listoflists\n```\n\nThe current output of this code is `[(7, 8, 9], 0), ([7, 8, 9], 0), ([7, 8, 9], 0), ([7, 8, 9], 1), ([7, 8, 9], 2), ([7, 8, 9], 3), ([7, 8, 9], 4), ([7, 8, 9], 5), ([7, 8, 9], 6), ([7, 8, 9], 7)]`. However, I am trying to achieve an output such as `[(0],0), ([0,1],0), ...`. Could someone explain why the first argument of each tuple in my list of lists is being updated each time, but the second argument list[0] is not? How can I fix this issue?"

        "content": "The issue in your code stems from the way lists are being appended to `listoflists`. When you append `(list, list[0])`, you are appending a reference to the same `list` object each time. Therefore, when `list` is modified in subsequent iterations, all the tuples in `listoflists` reflect the most recent state of `list`. However, `list[0]` is evaluated at the time of appending, so its value is fixed at that moment for each tuple.\n\nTo fix this issue and achieve the desired output, you should append a copy of `list` to `listoflists` instead of the reference to the same `list` object. You can use `list.copy()` or `list[:]` for this purpose. Here's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nlistoflists = []\nlist = []\nfor i in range(0, 10):\n    list.append(i)\n    if len(list) > 3:\n        list.remove(list[0])\n        # Append a copy of the list\n        listoflists.append((list[:], list[0]))\nprint(listoflists)\n```\n\nThis code will give you the desired output where each tuple in `listoflists` contains a distinct copy of the list at that iteration, along with the first element of that list."
