I want to sum the elements for the indices of each list in the list, like adding numbers in a matrix column to get a single list. I am assuming that all lists in data are equal in length. How can I iterate over this list of lists without getting an index out of range error? Could I possibly use a lambda function for this task?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can sum the elements for each index across the sublists using a combination of Python's `zip` function and a list comprehension. This approach will naturally handle lists of equal length without running into an \"index out of range\" error. You can indeed use a lambda function, although it's not necessary. Here is a simple and effective way to do it:\n\n```python\ndata = [[3, 7, 2], [1, 4, 5], [9, 8, 7]]\n\n# Using zip to transpose the list of lists and then summing each tuple\ncolumn_sums = list(map(lambda x: sum(x), zip(*data)))\n\nprint(column_sums)  # Output: [13, 19, 14]\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of how this works:\n- `zip(*data)`: This transposes the list of lists, so that each tuple contains the elements from each sublist at the same index. For the given `data`, this results in `[(3, 1, 9), (7, 4, 8), (2, 5, 7)]`.\n- `map(lambda x: sum(x), ...)`: This applies a lambda function to sum each tuple produced by `zip`.\n- `list(...)`: Converts the map object back into a list to get the final result.\n\nThis method is efficient and clean, making good use of Python's built-in functions."
