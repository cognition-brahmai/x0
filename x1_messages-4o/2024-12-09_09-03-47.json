        "content": "Certainly! To create an online store using Django where you can list products and accept orders, you'll need to define several models to represent the core entities of your application. Typically, you'll need models for `Product`, `Order`, and `OrderItem`. Here's a basic example of how you might define these models:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass Product(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n    description = models.TextField()\n    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)\n    stock = models.PositiveIntegerField()\n    available = models.BooleanField(default=True)\n    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)\n    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return self.name\n\nclass Order(models.Model):\n    customer_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n    customer_email = models.EmailField()\n    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)\n    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)\n    is_paid = models.BooleanField(default=False)\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"Order {self.id} by {self.customer_name}\"\n\nclass OrderItem(models.Model):\n    order = models.ForeignKey(Order, related_name='items', on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n    product = models.ForeignKey(Product, related_name='order_items', on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n    quantity = models.PositiveIntegerField()\n    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)  # price at the time of order\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"{self.quantity} of {self.product.name}\"\n\n    def get_total_price(self):\n        return self.price * self.quantity\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Product Model**: Represents the items available in your store. It includes fields like `name`, `description`, `price`, `stock`, and `available` to track the basic attributes of a product.\n\n- **Order Model**: Represents a customer order. It stores information like `customer_name`, `customer_email`, `created_at`, and `is_paid`. Each order can have multiple items, hence the relationship with `OrderItem`.\n\n- **OrderItem Model**: Represents a specific product within an order. It links to both the `Order` and `Product` models and includes fields for `quantity` and `price` (at the time of order).\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- **Relationships**: The `ForeignKey` fields establish a one-to-many relationship between `Order` and `OrderItem`, and between `Product` and `OrderItem`.\n\n- **Methods**: The `get_total_price()` method in `OrderItem` calculates the total cost of each item based on its quantity and price.\n\n- **Admin Interface**: You will likely want to register these models in the Django admin to easily manage them.\n\nRemember, this is a basic setup. Depending on your requirements, you might want to add more fields or models, such as categories, product images, user authentication, or payment processing."
