        "content": "Certainly! The Shoelace algorithm, also known as Gauss's area formula, is a mathematical algorithm to determine the area of a simple polygon whose vertices are defined by their Cartesian coordinates. Below is a Python script to calculate the area of a polygon using the Shoelace algorithm.\n\n```python\ndef shoelace_algorithm(vertices):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a polygon using the Shoelace algorithm.\n\n    Parameters:\n    vertices (list): A list of tuples where each tuple contains the x and y coordinates of a vertex.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The absolute area of the polygon.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(vertices)  # Number of vertices\n    area = 0\n\n    # Iterate through each vertex\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Calculate the partial area for the current vertex\n        x1, y1 = vertices[i]\n        x2, y2 = vertices[(i + 1) % n]  # Next vertex, using modulo for wrap-around\n\n        # Shoelace formula contribution\n        area += x1 * y2\n        area -= y1 * x2\n\n    # Return the absolute value of the area divided by 2\n    return abs(area) / 2.0\n\n# Example usage:\n# Define the vertices of the polygon\npolygon_vertices = [(4, 10), (9, 7), (11, 2), (2, 2)]\n\n# Calculate the area\narea = shoelace_algorithm(polygon_vertices)\nprint(\"The area of the polygon is:\", area)\n```\n\nIn this script, you provide the vertices of the polygon as a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the x and y coordinates of a vertex. The function `shoelace_algorithm` handles the calculation and returns the area of the polygon. The example usage illustrates how to use the function with a sample set of vertices."
