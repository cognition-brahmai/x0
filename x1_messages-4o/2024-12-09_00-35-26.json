I have trained over all the chunks in a random order six times, but the network has started to overfit. My assumption is that internal regularities within each chunk are starting to contradict one another. Therefore, I want to shuffle the data more thoroughly to train on different combinations. However, I am having issues generating a new permutation of 3.6 million rows of numpy data. Writing these arrays using numpy.savetxt creates very large files and I am unable to manipulate individual rows from a standard npy file in a way that can help to solve this problem. Currently, my idea is to create a permutation of paired indices (c, r) into the data, where c chooses a chunk and r chooses a row from that chunk. I would then store each row in a new preallocated array, and then save it. But I am looking for a less I/O-bound solution, preferably a principled way to shuffle random pairs of chunks together until I get a permutation that's statistically independent from the starting permutation. Can anyone suggest a good way to do this?"

        "content": "Shuffling large datasets effectively while minimizing I/O operations can be a challenge due to memory constraints. Your approach of using paired indices (c, r) to represent chunks and rows is a good start. Here's a strategy you can use to shuffle your data more efficiently:\n\n1. **Index Mapping**: Create an index array that maps each row to its respective chunk and row index. This will be a list of tuples, where each tuple is (chunk_index, row_index). If you have 3.6 million rows in 36 chunks of 100,000 rows each, this list will have 3.6 million entries.\n\n    ```python\n    import numpy as np\n\n    num_chunks = 36\n    rows_per_chunk = 100000\n    index_map = [(c, r) for c in range(num_chunks) for r in range(rows_per_chunk)]\n    ```\n\n2. **Shuffle Index Map**: Shuffle this index map using `numpy.random.shuffle`. This step randomizes the order of the index map without touching the actual data, minimizing I/O.\n\n    ```python\n    np.random.shuffle(index_map)\n    ```\n\n3. **Data Access**: When accessing your data for training, use this shuffled index map to retrieve data in a random order. This way, you are shuffling the order in which you access the rows, without physically reorganizing your data on disk.\n\n4. **Batch Processing**: Use the shuffled index map to create batches for training. For each index in the shuffled list, access the corresponding chunk and row, and construct your batch.\n\n    ```python\n    def get_shuffled_batch(data_chunks, index_map, batch_size):\n        batch = []\n        for i in range(batch_size):\n            c, r = index_map[i]\n            batch.append(data_chunks[c][r])\n        return np.array(batch)\n    ```\n\n5. **Iterate Over Epochs**: After each epoch, reshuffle the index map to ensure that the data is accessed in a new random order each time.\n\nBy using this index-based shuffling, you minimize data movement and I/O operations, while ensuring that each epoch processes the data in a new order. This approach is both memory-efficient and effective in reducing overfitting by improving the randomness of your input data."
