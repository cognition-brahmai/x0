However, I am having trouble applying this concept to lambda functions. For example, I have a lambda function that looks like this:\n```python\nfunc = lambda var1, var2: var1.index(var2)\n```\nEvery attempt I've made to add type hints to this lambda function's parameters and return types has resulted in a syntax error. Is it possible to type hint a lambda function? If not, are there any planned updates to allow type hinting for lambdas or is there a specific reason, beyond the clear syntax conflict, why it's not possible?"

        "content": "In Python, type hinting for lambda functions isn't as straightforward as it is for regular functions, because the syntax of lambda functions is designed to be concise and doesn't support annotations directly. However, you can achieve a similar effect by using type hints in a couple of alternative ways.\n\nOne common approach is to use the `Callable` type from the `typing` module to specify the expected types of the lambda function's parameters and return value. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable\n\n# Define the type hint for the lambda\nFuncType = Callable[[str, str], int]\n\n# Assign the lambda to a variable with the specified type\nfunc: FuncType = lambda var1, var2: var1.index(var2)\n```\n\nIn this example, `FuncType` is a type hint that specifies a callable taking two `str` arguments and returning an `int`. You then use `FuncType` to annotate the `func` variable.\n\nAnother approach is to use a regular function instead of a lambda if type hinting is crucial for the clarity of your code. Here\u2019s how you can rewrite the lambda using a regular function with type hints:\n\n```python\ndef func(var1: str, var2: str) -> int:\n    return var1.index(var2)\n```\n\nAs of now, there are no plans in the Python language to add syntax for directly type hinting lambda functions due to their nature of being anonymous and concise. The current best practice is to use `Callable` or define a regular function when you need to provide clarity with type hints."
