I have lists like [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6]] and I want to convert them into [[1,3,5], [2,4,6]]. I am having difficulty figuring out how to split the list and pass the individual elements to the zip function. I would prefer a functional solution."

        "content": "To achieve this transformation, you can use the `zip` function along with the unpacking operator (`*`). The unpacking operator is used to unpack the elements of the list of lists, so that they can be passed as individual arguments to the `zip` function. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nlist_of_lists = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]\nzipped_list = list(zip(*list_of_lists))\n\n# If you want the result as a list of lists instead of a list of tuples\nzipped_list_of_lists = [list(item) for item in zipped_list]\n\nprint(zipped_list_of_lists)  # Output: [[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of how this works:\n- `*list_of_lists` unpacks the list into individual lists, so `zip` receives them as separate arguments.\n- `zip` pairs up elements from each list, creating tuples.\n- The result from `zip` is a list of tuples, so we use a list comprehension to convert each tuple into a list, resulting in the desired format.\n\nThis solution is both functional and concise."
