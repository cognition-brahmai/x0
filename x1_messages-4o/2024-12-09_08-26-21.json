I currently have a list as follows:\n\n```python\nx = [[\"a\",\"b\"], [\"c\"]]\n```\n\nI want to iterate over \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\". The best solution I have found so far is:\n\n```python\nresult = []\n[ result.extend(el) for el in x] \n\nfor el in result:\n  print el\n```\n\nIs there a better or more concise way to achieve this?"

        "content": "Yes, there is a more concise and Pythonic way to flatten a list of lists into a single list or iterator. You can use a list comprehension along with the `itertools.chain` function to achieve this. Here are two ways to do it:\n\n1. **Using List Comprehension:**\n\n   You can flatten the list using a nested list comprehension. This is concise and easy to understand:\n\n   ```python\n   x = [[\"a\", \"b\"], [\"c\"]]\n   result = [item for sublist in x for item in sublist]\n\n   for el in result:\n       print(el)\n   ```\n\n2. **Using `itertools.chain`:**\n\n   The `itertools.chain` function is a great way to flatten a list of lists. It creates an iterator that returns elements from the first iterable until it is exhausted, then proceeds to the next iterable, until all of the iterables are exhausted:\n\n   ```python\n   from itertools import chain\n\n   x = [[\"a\", \"b\"], [\"c\"]]\n   result = chain.from_iterable(x)\n\n   for el in result:\n       print(el)\n   ```\n\nBoth methods will give you the desired result of iterating over \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\". Choose the one that you find more readable and suitable for your use case."
