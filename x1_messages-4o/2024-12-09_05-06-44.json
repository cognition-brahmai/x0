I am aware of the timeit module, but it has some limitations like the inability to adaptively select the number of runs. Using the current code, it runs the code a million times:\n\n```python\nimport timeit\nt=timeit.Timer(\"code(f)\", \"from __main__ import code,f\")\nt.timeit() \n```\nHowever, the %timeit IPython magic command does this adaptively. Is there a way to call the %timeit magic from a Python script? Or is there a better solution for timing Python scripts, similar to this MATLAB code that does the job automatically and also indicates if the function's overhead is large? http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/18798"

        "content": "In Python scripts, you cannot directly use IPython magic commands like `%timeit` because they are specific to the IPython environment. However, you can achieve similar functionality by using the `timeit` module in a more flexible way or by using other approaches.\n\nHere's how you can mimic the adaptive behavior of `%timeit` in a Python script:\n\n1. **Using the `timeit` module with a custom setup:**\n\n   You can create a function that measures the execution time and adjusts the number of iterations based on the time taken. Here's a simple example of how you can implement adaptive timing:\n\n   ```python\n   import timeit\n\n   def adaptive_timeit(stmt, setup=\"pass\", target_time=1.0):\n       # Start with a single iteration\n       number = 1\n       while True:\n           # Measure the time for the current number of iterations\n           timer = timeit.Timer(stmt, setup)\n           time_taken = timer.timeit(number)\n           \n           # If the time taken is longer than the target, break the loop\n           if time_taken >= target_time:\n               break\n           \n           # Otherwise, increase the number of iterations\n           number *= 10\n       \n       # Return the time taken per iteration\n       return time_taken / number\n\n   # Example usage\n   code = \"sum(range(100))\"\n   setup = \"\"\n   avg_time_per_run = adaptive_timeit(code, setup)\n   print(f\"Average time per run: {avg_time_per_run:.6f} seconds\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Using `time` module for a more manual approach:**\n\n   If you want a more manual approach, you can use the `time` module to measure the start and end times around your code block:\n\n   ```python\n   import time\n\n   def your_function():\n       # Your code here\n       sum(range(100))\n\n   # Measure the time\n   start_time = time.time()\n   your_function()\n   end_time = time.time()\n\n   print(f\"Execution time: {end_time - start_time:.6f} seconds\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Using external libraries like `perf_counter` from `time` module:**\n\n   The `time.perf_counter()` function provides a higher resolution timer which is more appropriate for timing code execution:\n\n   ```python\n   import time\n\n   def your_function():\n       # Your code here\n       sum(range(100))\n\n   start_time = time.perf_counter()\n   your_function()\n   end_time = time.perf_counter()\n\n   print(f\"Execution time: {end_time - start_time:.6f} seconds\")\n   ```\n\nThese methods allow you to measure the execution time of your Python code more flexibly and can be adapted to suit your specific needs."
