Currently, I am able to plot them on a normal scale using the following code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nx = 10**np.arange(1, 10)\ny = 10**np.arange(1, 10)*2\ndf1 = pd.DataFrame(data=y, index=x)\ndf2 = pd.DataFrame(data = {'x': x, 'y': y}) \nsns.lmplot('x', 'y', df2)\n```\n\nThe plot generated is on a normal scale. How can I adjust this to a log-log scale?"

        "content": "To plot your data on a log-log scale using Seaborn's `lmplot`, you can make use of Matplotlib's `LogScale` after creating the plot. The `lmplot` function itself doesn't have a direct parameter to set the axes to a logarithmic scale, but you can adjust the axes after the plot has been created.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve a log-log scale:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Generate data\nx = 10**np.arange(1, 10)\ny = 10**np.arange(1, 10)*2\ndf2 = pd.DataFrame(data={'x': x, 'y': y})\n\n# Create the plot\nsns.lmplot('x', 'y', data=df2)\n\n# Set the x and y axes to a log scale\nplt.xscale('log')\nplt.yscale('log')\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this code, after creating the `lmplot`, we use `plt.xscale('log')` and `plt.yscale('log')` to set the x and y axes to a logarithmic scale, respectively. This will transform the plot into a log-log scale."
