However, to make it a little more challenging, you have set certain rules that need to be followed. The first rule is that the gift opening should be conducted before the dance-off, while the balloon popping activity should happen after the cake cutting ceremony. Additionally, the cake cutting should take place before the gift opening, and the dance-off activity should be scheduled after the gift opening. Given these constraints, can you come up with a perfect schedule for the activities to make your friend's birthday unforgettable?"

Let's break down the constraints:\n\n1. Gift opening should be before the dance-off.\n2. Balloon popping should happen after the cake cutting.\n3. Cake cutting should be before the gift opening.\n4. Dance-off should be after the gift opening.\n\nBased on these rules, we can derive the following order:\n\n1. **Cake Cutting**: This activity should happen first since it needs to be before both gift opening and balloon popping.\n2. **Gift Opening**: This should follow the cake cutting, as it needs to happen before the dance-off.\n3. **Balloon Popping**: This can happen after cake cutting, but before or after the dance-off doesn't matter according to the rules. However, to follow the natural flow after cake cutting, it can be placed here.\n4. **Dance-Off**: Finally, this should be the last activity, as it must occur after gift opening.\n\nSo, the schedule will be:\n\n1. Cake Cutting\n2. Gift Opening\n3. Balloon Popping\n4. Dance-Off\n\nThis schedule meets all the specified constraints and should make for a fun and memorable birthday party for your friend!"
