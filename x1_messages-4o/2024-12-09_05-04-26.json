I have two fixtures, 'form_data' and 'example_event', where 'example_event' uses 'form_data' as an argument. However, when I run pytest, it gives an error saying \"fixture 'form_data' not found\". Is it possible to use one fixture inside another and if so, how can I resolve this error? Here is the code I'm working with:\n\n```python\n@pytest.fixture\ndef form_data():\n    return { ... }\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef example_event(form_data):\n    return {... 'data': form_data, ... }\n```"

        "content": "Yes, it's definitely possible to use one fixture inside another in pytest. The error you're encountering might be due to several reasons, such as incorrect import statements or scope issues. Let's go through a few steps to ensure that your fixtures are set up correctly:\n\n1. **Ensure Proper Imports**: Make sure you have imported `pytest` at the top of your test file.\n\n    ```python\n    import pytest\n    ```\n\n2. **Check Fixture Scope**: By default, fixtures have a function scope. If you have defined these fixtures in a different module, ensure that they are being imported correctly in your test file. Fixtures can be shared across multiple test files if they are placed in a `conftest.py` file in the same directory or in a parent directory.\n\n3. **Using Decorators Correctly**: Ensure that the `@pytest.fixture` decorator is directly above the fixture function and there are no syntax issues.\n\n4. **Run Pytest from the Correct Directory**: Execute `pytest` from the directory where your test files are located, or use the correct path.\n\n5. **Check for Typos**: Verify there are no spelling mistakes in the fixture names.\n\nHere is a revised example of how you should structure your code:\n\n```python\nimport pytest\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef form_data():\n    return {\n        # Example data\n        'key1': 'value1',\n        'key2': 'value2'\n    }\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef example_event(form_data):\n    return {\n        'event_type': 'example',\n        'data': form_data\n    }\n\ndef test_example_event(example_event):\n    assert example_event['data']['key1'] == 'value1'\n```\n\n**Additional Tips**:\n\n- **Check Test Discovery**: Make sure your test filename starts with `test_` or ends with `_test.py` to ensure pytest discovers and runs the tests.\n\n- **Debugging**: If the issue persists, you can run pytest with the `-v` (verbose) flag or `--fixtures` option to get more information about the fixtures.\n\n- **Pytest Version**: Ensure that you are using a compatible version of pytest. Consider updating it to the latest version if necessary.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to resolve the fixture not found error and successfully utilize one fixture within another."
