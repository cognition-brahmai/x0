On the gallery list page, I do not want to display all the photos of each gallery, as it would consume too much space and load time. Is there a way to display only the first 3 photos from the photo set? I am trying to use a for loop with a counter, but it does not seem to be possible with the templating system, as shown in my pseudocode:\n\n```python\n{% for photos in gallery.photo_set %}\n   {% if forloop.counter lt 3 %}\n     <img src=\"{{ photos.url }}\">\n   {% endif %}\n{% endfor %}\n```\n\nI am aware that I could potentially write my own template tag or do something from the view aspect, but I haven't looked too far into that yet. I could also consider adding a preview field to the model. However, I was wondering if there are other, more efficient methods to achieve this."

        "content": "In Django templates, you can achieve this by using the `slice` template filter, which allows you to work with a subset of a list. This is a more straightforward way than using a loop counter to limit the number of photos displayed. Here's how you can modify your template code to display only the first three photos:\n\n```html\n{% for photo in gallery.photo_set.all|slice:\":3\" %}\n    <img src=\"{{ photo.url }}\" alt=\"Gallery Photo\">\n{% endfor %}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- The `slice` filter is applied to the `photo_set.all` queryset, which returns the first 3 photos.\n- The syntax `\":3\"` within the `slice` filter specifies that you want to include elements from the start of the list up to, but not including, the 3rd element (i.e., indices 0, 1, and 2).\n\nThis approach is efficient and clean because it leverages Django's template filters without needing to modify your models or views.\n\nIf you want to do this from the view side, you can limit the queryset in your view function before passing it to the template:\n\n```python\ndef gallery_list(request):\n    galleries = Gallery.objects.all()\n    for gallery in galleries:\n        gallery.preview_photos = gallery.photo_set.all()[:3]\n    return render(request, 'gallery_list.html', {'galleries': galleries})\n```\n\nThen, in your template, you would iterate over `gallery.preview_photos`:\n\n```html\n{% for gallery in galleries %}\n    <div class=\"gallery\">\n        {% for photo in gallery.preview_photos %}\n            <img src=\"{{ photo.url }}\" alt=\"Gallery Photo\">\n        {% endfor %}\n    </div>\n{% endfor %}\n```\n\nThis method allows you to handle the slicing logic in the view, which can be useful if you have more complex logic or want to keep your templates simple."
