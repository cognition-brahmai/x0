This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS/BODMAS.\n\n1. First, perform the multiplication and division:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Now substitute back into the expression:\n   \\[\n   10 - 4 + 4\n   \\]\n\n3. Then perform the subtraction and addition from left to right:\n   \\[\n   10 - 4 = 6\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   6 + 4 = 10\n   \\]\n\nSo, the result of the expression \\(10 - 6 \\times \\frac{2}{3} + 4\\) is 10."
