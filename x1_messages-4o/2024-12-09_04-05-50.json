I was hoping for a code like this:\n\n```python\nimport datetime as dt\n\nnow = dt.datetime.now()\nlater = now + dt.timedelta(months=1)\n```\nHowever, this does not seem to work. I also want to be able to go to the same day, or the nearest alternative, in the next month. For instance, if I have a datetime object set at January 1st, I want it to increment to February 1st. Conversely, if set at February 28th, I'd like it to increment to March 31st, not March 28th. The idea is for the last day of the month to map to the last day of the next month, with all other days directly linking to the same numbered day in the next month. Is there a simple way to get this done in the current release of Python?"

        "content": "The task of incrementing a `datetime` object by one month can be handled using the `dateutil` library, which offers a convenient `relativedelta` class that supports month increments. This library is not part of the standard library, so you'll need to install it first using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install python-dateutil\n```\n\nThen, you can use `relativedelta` to achieve the desired functionality. Here's how you can increment a `datetime` object by one month, taking care of edge cases like the end of the month:\n\n```python\nimport datetime as dt\nfrom dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta\n\nnow = dt.datetime.now()\n\n# Increment by one month\nlater = now + relativedelta(months=1)\n\nprint(\"Current Date:\", now)\nprint(\"One Month Later:\", later)\n```\n\nThe `relativedelta` class automatically manages the transition between months, taking into account different month lengths and leap years. For example, it will correctly handle cases like moving from January 31st to February 28th/29th, or February 28th to March 31st, as you described.\n\nThis method should satisfy your requirement of mapping the last day of the month to the last day of the next month, and other days to the same day number in the next month."
