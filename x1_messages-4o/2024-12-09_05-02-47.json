My goal is to have a dataframe that looks like this:\n\n```python\nA   B   SUM_C   CUMSUM_C       \n1   1   10      10     \n1   2   20      30   \n```\n\nHow can I add the cumulative sum as a new column to the existing dataframe rather than generating a new dataframe with 'SUM_C' replaced with cumulative sum?"

        "content": "You can add a cumulative sum column to your existing DataFrame using the `cumsum()` method provided by pandas. This method calculates the cumulative sum of the specified column. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Define your dataframe\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    'A': [1, 1],\n    'B': [1, 2],\n    'SUM_C': [10, 20]\n})\n\n# Calculate the cumulative sum of the 'SUM_C' column and add it as a new column 'CUMSUM_C'\ndf['CUMSUM_C'] = df['SUM_C'].cumsum()\n\n# Display the updated dataframe\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThis will output the updated DataFrame with the cumulative sum column added:\n\n```\n   A  B  SUM_C  CUMSUM_C\n0  1  1     10        10\n1  1  2     20        30\n```\n\nBy using `df['SUM_C'].cumsum()`, you calculate the cumulative sum of the 'SUM_C' column and assign it to a new column 'CUMSUM_C' in the same DataFrame."
