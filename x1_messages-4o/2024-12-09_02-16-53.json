        "content": "Yes, in Python 3.7 and later, dictionaries maintain the insertion order of items. This means that when you iterate over a dictionary or retrieve its items, they will be in the order they were inserted. Here\u2019s a simple example:\n\n```python\n# Creating a dictionary\nmy_dict = {\n    'apple': 1,\n    'banana': 2,\n    'cherry': 3\n}\n\n# Iterating over the dictionary\nfor key, value in my_dict.items():\n    print(key, value)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\napple 1\nbanana 2\ncherry 3\n```\n\nIn Python 3.6, maintaining insertion order was an implementation detail of CPython, but it became a part of the language specification starting from Python 3.7.\n\nIf you are using a version prior to Python 3.7 and want to ensure order, you can use `collections.OrderedDict`:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\n\n# Creating an OrderedDict\nordered_dict = OrderedDict()\nordered_dict['apple'] = 1\nordered_dict['banana'] = 2\nordered_dict['cherry'] = 3\n\n# Iterating over the OrderedDict\nfor key, value in ordered_dict.items():\n    print(key, value)\n```\n\nThis will also maintain the insertion order when iterated."
