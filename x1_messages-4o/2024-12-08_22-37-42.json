The prime digit numbers are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\nLet's break down the steps to achieve the solution:\n\n1. Identify the digit characters in the string: \"8\", \"3\", \"7\", \"6\".\n2. Check which of these digits are prime: \n   - \"8\" is not a prime number.\n   - \"3\" is a prime number.\n   - \"7\" is a prime number.\n   - \"6\" is not a prime number.\n3. Sum the prime digits: 3 + 7 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the summation of the prime digit numbers in the string \"fw83p7r6\" is 10."
