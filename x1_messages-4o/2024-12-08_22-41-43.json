Your task is to come up with a C++ code that showcases the AR technology in each industry. The code should not only demonstrate the technical aspects but also solve a real-world problem faced by the industry. Here is an example code snippet that showcases AR technology in retail. Can you modify it to make it more applicable to healthcare, education, or entertainment?\nCode Snippet:\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\nint main()\n{\n  //initialize AR object\n  AR retail;\n  \n  //load retail product data\n  retail.loadProductData(\"product_data.csv\");\n  \n  //display product info with AR overlay\n  retail.displayProductInfo();\n  \n  return 0;\n}\nTable of AR Implementations:\n| Industry    | AR Implementation                                       |\n|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| Entertainment|                                                         |\n| Education   |                                                         |\n| Healthcare  |                                                         |\n| Retail      | Load product data from a CSV file and display info with AR|"

Below, I will provide modified versions of the code for each of these industries:\n\n### Entertainment:\nIn the entertainment industry, AR can be used to create interactive experiences for users, such as adding virtual characters or effects to live performances or games.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nclass AR {\npublic:\n    void loadCharacterData(const string& filePath) {\n        // Load virtual character data from a file\n        cout << \"Loading character data from \" << filePath << endl;\n    }\n\n    void displayInteractiveExperience() {\n        // Display interactive AR experience with virtual characters\n        cout << \"Displaying interactive AR experience with virtual characters.\" << endl;\n    }\n};\n\nint main() {\n    // Initialize AR object\n    AR entertainment;\n\n    // Load virtual character data\n    entertainment.loadCharacterData(\"character_data.csv\");\n\n    // Display interactive AR experience\n    entertainment.displayInteractiveExperience();\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Education:\nIn the education sector, AR can be used to create immersive learning experiences, such as visualizing complex concepts or historical events.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nclass AR {\npublic:\n    void loadEducationalContent(const string& filePath) {\n        // Load educational content data from a file\n        cout << \"Loading educational content from \" << filePath << endl;\n    }\n\n    void displayLearningExperience() {\n        // Display AR-based learning experience\n        cout << \"Displaying AR-based learning experience.\" << endl;\n    }\n};\n\nint main() {\n    // Initialize AR object\n    AR education;\n\n    // Load educational content data\n    education.loadEducationalContent(\"educational_content.csv\");\n\n    // Display AR-based learning experience\n    education.displayLearningExperience();\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Healthcare:\nIn the healthcare sector, AR can be used for various applications such as assisting in surgeries or providing patients with a better understanding of their medical conditions.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nclass AR {\npublic:\n    void loadPatientData(const string& filePath) {\n        // Load patient data from a file\n        cout << \"Loading patient data from \" << filePath << endl;\n    }\n\n    void displayMedicalVisualization() {\n        // Display medical visualization with AR\n        cout << \"Displaying medical visualization with AR.\" << endl;\n    }\n};\n\nint main() {\n    // Initialize AR object\n    AR healthcare;\n\n    // Load patient data\n    healthcare.loadPatientData(\"patient_data.csv\");\n\n    // Display medical visualization\n    healthcare.displayMedicalVisualization();\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate how AR can be tailored to different industries by addressing specific needs and enhancing the user experience in entertainment, education, and healthcare."
