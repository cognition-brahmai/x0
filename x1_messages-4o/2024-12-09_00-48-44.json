        "content": "To change the Python interpreter path in Spyder on a Debian system, you'll want to configure Spyder to use a different Python environment or interpreter. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Open Spyder:**\n   - Launch Spyder from your applications menu or by typing `spyder` in the terminal.\n\n2. **Access Preferences:**\n   - Go to `Tools` in the top menu and select `Preferences`.\n\n3. **Configure Python Interpreter:**\n   - In the Preferences window, navigate to `Python interpreter` on the left pane.\n\n4. **Select a New Interpreter:**\n   - You will see options to select the Python interpreter. You can choose from the following:\n     - **Default**: Uses the default Python interpreter.\n     - **Use the following Python interpreter**: Allows you to specify a custom path.\n\n5. **Specify the Custom Path:**\n   - Select \"Use the following Python interpreter\" option.\n   - Enter the path to your desired Python interpreter. For example, if you have another version installed, such as Python 3.8 in `/usr/local/bin/python3.8`, you would enter that path.\n\n6. **Apply and Restart:**\n   - Click `Apply` and then `OK` to save the changes.\n   - Restart Spyder for the changes to take effect.\n\nBy doing this, you can direct Spyder to use a different version of Python than the one located at `/usr/bin/python3`. Make sure the desired Python version is properly installed on your system. You can check available versions by typing `which python3.x` or `ls /usr/bin/python*` in the terminal."
