However, I am encountering an AssertionError: 'Could not compute output Tensor'. The model is defined as follows:\n\n```python\ndef create_model_multiple():\n    input1 = tf.keras.Input(shape=(13,), name = 'I1')\n    input2 = tf.keras.Input(shape=(6,), name = 'I2')\n    hidden1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units = 4, activation='relu')(input1)\n    hidden2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units = 4, activation='relu')(input2)\n    merge = tf.keras.layers.concatenate([hidden1, hidden2])\n    hidden3 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units = 3, activation='relu')(merge)\n    output1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units = 2, activation='softmax', name ='O1')(hidden3)\n    output2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units = 2, activation='softmax', name = 'O2')(hidden3)\n    model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs = [input1,input2], outputs = [output1,output2])\n    model.compile(optimizer='adam',\n                  loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',\n                  metrics=['accuracy'])\n    return model\n```\n\nI am using the following command to fit the model:\n\n```python\nhistory = model.fit({'I1':train_data, 'I2':new_train_data},\n                    {'O1':train_labels, 'O2': new_target_label},\n                    validation_data=(val_data,val_labels),\n                    epochs=100,\n                    verbose = 1)\n```\nThe shapes of my input data are as follows: train_data is (192,13), new_train_data is (192,6), and train_labels, new_target_labels are (192,). The error occurs after a few steps into the first epoch. How can I solve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you are encountering likely arises from a mismatch in the expected format of the validation data in the `fit` method. When using multiple inputs and outputs, you must ensure that both your training and validation data are structured correctly. Here's a breakdown of potential issues and how to address them:\n\n1. **Validation Data Structure**: The validation data should be provided in a similar structure to the training data. This means that both the input and output data for validation should be dictionaries when you're using named inputs and outputs.\n\n2. **Validation Data Format**: In your `fit` method, you are providing the validation data as `validation_data=(val_data, val_labels)`. This should be structured like the training data, where both input and output are dictionaries.\n\n3. **Ensure Consistent Input Shapes**: Make sure that each input and output in the dictionaries corresponds to the model inputs and outputs. \n\nHere's how you can modify the `fit` method to include validation data correctly:\n\n```python\nhistory = model.fit(\n    {'I1': train_data, 'I2': new_train_data},\n    {'O1': train_labels, 'O2': new_target_labels},\n    validation_data=(\n        {'I1': val_data, 'I2': val_new_data},\n        {'O1': val_labels, 'O2': val_new_labels}\n    ),\n    epochs=100,\n    verbose=1\n)\n```\n\nMake sure that `val_data` and `val_new_data` correspond to the shapes expected by your model's input layers, i.e., `val_data` should be `(num_samples, 13)` and `val_new_data` should be `(num_samples, 6)`. Similarly, ensure that `val_labels` and `val_new_labels` are properly formatted for each output.\n\nIf this does not resolve the problem, it might be helpful to print out the shapes of your validation data before fitting the model to ensure that they match the expected shapes."
