Whenever I try to plot something in JupyterLab, I encounter the following error: \"Javascript Error: IPython is not defined\". However, when I run the same code in Spyder using an IPython kernel, it seems to work perfectly fine. I have been searching online but cannot seem to find a solution for this issue. Can anyone help me understand and resolve this error?"

        "content": "The error message \"Javascript Error: IPython is not defined\" in JupyterLab is typically related to frontend issues, particularly with JavaScript dependencies that are not loading correctly. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure JupyterLab is Up-to-Date**: Make sure you are using the latest version of JupyterLab. You can update it using the following command:\n   ```bash\n   conda update jupyterlab\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Extensions**: Sometimes, JupyterLab extensions can cause conflicts. Check if there are any extensions installed that might be causing the issue and try disabling them temporarily to see if the problem persists:\n   ```bash\n   jupyter labextension list\n   ```\n\n3. **Rebuild JupyterLab**: If you've installed or updated extensions, you might need to rebuild JupyterLab to ensure everything is properly set up:\n   ```bash\n   jupyter lab build\n   ```\n\n4. **Clear Cache**: Sometimes, clearing the browser cache can help resolve frontend issues. Clear your browser cache and try again.\n\n5. **Check for Specific Library Issues**: If you're using a specific library for plotting (like Plotly, Bokeh, etc.), ensure that the library is properly installed and that you're using compatible versions. Some libraries might require additional JupyterLab extensions.\n\n6. **Update Node.js and npm**: JupyterLab uses Node.js for its extensions. Ensure you have the latest version of Node.js and npm:\n   ```bash\n   conda install -c conda-forge nodejs\n   ```\n\n7. **Use `%matplotlib inline`**: If you are using Matplotlib for plotting, ensure that the magic command `%matplotlib inline` is included at the beginning of your notebook to enable inline plotting.\n\n8. **Try Another Browser**: Sometimes, certain browsers handle JavaScript differently. Try accessing JupyterLab using a different browser to see if the issue remains.\n\nIf none of the above solutions work, consider reinstalling JupyterLab and its dependencies as a last resort. Remember to back up your work before doing so. If the problem persists even after these attempts, it might be helpful to check for any open issues on the JupyterLab GitHub repository or consider raising a new issue with details of your setup and the error you're encountering."
