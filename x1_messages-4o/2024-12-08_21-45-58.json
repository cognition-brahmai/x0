Additionally, the speech must be presented in front of a diverse audience with varying educational backgrounds and cultural perspectives. The speech must be delivered in English, but can include quotes or phrases in a second language. Finally, the topic must not be a commonly discussed issue such as climate change or gun control, but should instead focus on a lesser-known but equally important topic such as the impact of gentrification on marginalized communities or the need for increased mental health resources in underserved areas."
