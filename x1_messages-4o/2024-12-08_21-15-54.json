        "content": "I recommend \"The Breadwinner\" by Deborah Ellis. This book won the Peter Pan Award in Sweden and has been translated into multiple languages. It tells the story of a young girl named Parvana living under the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. The novel provides a glimpse into Afghan culture and the challenges faced by its people. It's an engaging and thought-provoking read for a 12-year-old interested in exploring different cultures."
