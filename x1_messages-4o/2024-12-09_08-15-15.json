The error I'm getting seems to be related to my attempt to assign a many-to-many field in my view (`views.py`) from a form (`forms.py`). The error message is \"Direct assignment to the forward side of a many-to-many set is prohibited. Use emails_for_help.set() instead\". I'm currently using Django version 2.0 and Python 3.5. How can I correctly assign a many-to-many field in Django views? \n\nHere is the code for `models.py`:\n```python\nclass User(AbstractUser):\n    username=models.CharField(max_length=20)\n    email = models.EmailField(_('email address'), unique=True)\n\n\nclass Setupuser(models.Model):\n    organization=models.CharField(max_length=200,blank=False,null=True)\n    emails_for_help = models.ManyToManyField(User)\n```\n\nFor `views.py`, the code is:\n```python\nclass Set_user(FormView):\n    template_name=\"pkm_templates/set_up_user.html\"\n    form_class = Set_User_Form\n    success_url = '/thanks/'\n\n    def form_valid(self, form):\n        org = form.cleaned_data.get('organization')\n        emails = form.cleaned_data.get(\"emails_for_help\")\n        instance = Setupuser(organization=org,emails_for_help=emails)\n        instance.save()\n        return redirect(\"/\")\n```\n\nAnd for `forms.py`:\n```python\nclass Set_User_Form(ModelForm):\n    emails_for_help = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(\n        queryset=User.objects.all(),\n        widget=forms.CheckboxSelectMultiple\n    )\n\n    class Meta:\n        model = Setupuser\n        fields = [\"organization\",\"emails_for_help\"]\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the way the ManyToManyField is being handled in your view. In Django, you can't directly assign a list of objects to a ManyToManyField when creating a new instance. Instead, you should first create and save the instance, and then use the `.set()` method to assign the many-to-many relationships. Here's how you can fix the code in your `views.py`:\n\n```python\nclass Set_user(FormView):\n    template_name = \"pkm_templates/set_up_user.html\"\n    form_class = Set_User_Form\n    success_url = '/thanks/'\n\n    def form_valid(self, form):\n        org = form.cleaned_data.get('organization')\n        emails = form.cleaned_data.get(\"emails_for_help\")\n        \n        # First create and save the Setupuser instance\n        instance = Setupuser(organization=org)\n        instance.save()\n\n        # Then set the many-to-many field using the .set() method\n        instance.emails_for_help.set(emails)\n\n        return redirect(\"/\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Create and Save the Instance First**:\n   You first need to create the `Setupuser` instance with the fields that are not many-to-many. This means saving the `organization` field first.\n\n2. **Use `.set()` Method**:\n   After saving the instance, use the `.set()` method to assign the many-to-many relationships. This method takes a list of objects or a queryset and assigns them to the many-to-many field.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to correctly assign the many-to-many field in your Django application."
