        "content": "In SQLAlchemy, both the `one` and `first` methods are used to retrieve records from a query result, but they have different behaviors and use cases:\n\n1. **`one()` Method:**\n   - The `one()` method is used when you expect exactly one result from a query. It assumes that the query should return exactly one row.\n   - If the query returns more than one row, `one()` will raise a `MultipleResultsFound` exception.\n   - If the query returns no rows, it will raise a `NoResultFound` exception.\n   - Use `one()` when you are certain that your query should return a single, unique result, and you want to enforce this expectation.\n\n   ```python\n   result = session.query(MyModel).filter_by(some_column=some_value).one()\n   ```\n\n2. **`first()` Method:**\n   - The `first()` method retrieves the first result of a query, or `None` if no results are found.\n   - It does not raise an exception if more than one row is returned; it simply fetches the first one.\n   - Use `first()` when you want to get a single row from a query but don't necessarily expect only one result. It's a safer option when you are uncertain about the number of results and only care about the first one.\n\n   ```python\n   result = session.query(MyModel).filter_by(some_column=some_value).first()\n   ```\n\nIn summary, use `one()` when you expect exactly one result and want to enforce it, and use `first()` when you want to retrieve the first result and don't mind if there are more or no results."
