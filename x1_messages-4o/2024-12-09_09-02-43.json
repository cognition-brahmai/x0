        "content": "Creating a new folder using PHP can be done using the `mkdir()` function. This function allows you to create a directory with specified permissions. Here's a simple example of how to use it:\n\n```php\n<?php\n$directoryPath = \"new_folder\"; // Specify the name or path of the directory you want to create\n\n// Check if the directory already exists\nif (!is_dir($directoryPath)) {\n    // Attempt to create the directory\n    if (mkdir($directoryPath, 0755, true)) {\n        echo \"Directory created successfully!\";\n    } else {\n        echo \"Failed to create directory.\";\n    }\n} else {\n    echo \"Directory already exists.\";\n}\n?>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`$directoryPath`**: This variable holds the path of the directory you want to create.\n- **`is_dir()`**: This function checks whether a directory already exists. It's a good practice to check before trying to create it to avoid errors.\n- **`mkdir()`**: This function creates the directory. It takes three parameters:\n  - The path of the directory.\n  - The permissions for the directory (e.g., `0755`).\n  - A boolean indicating whether to create nested directories specified in the path (set to `true` if you need to create nested directories).\n\n### Permissions:\n- The permission `0755` is a common setting that allows the owner to read, write, and execute, while others can only read and execute. Adjust this according to your needs.\n\nRemember to ensure that the PHP script has the necessary permissions to create directories in the specified location."
