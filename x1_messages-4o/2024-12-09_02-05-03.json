I have seen many posts addressing how to extract all text in an ordered manner, but I am interested in an intermediate step where I also get the text locations. The output should ideally look something like this:\n\n```\n489, 41,  \"Signature\"\n500, 52,  \"b\"\n630, 202, \"a_g_i_r\"\n```"

        "content": "To extract text boxes and their coordinates from a PDF file using PDFMiner, you can utilize the `PDFPageInterpreter` and `LAParams` classes to analyze the layout of the PDF. Below is a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n1. **Install PDFMiner**: Make sure you have PDFMiner installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pdfminer.six\n   ```\n\n2. **Python Script**: Use the following Python script to extract text and its coordinates:\n\n   ```python\n   from pdfminer.high_level import extract_pages\n   from pdfminer.layout import LTTextBoxHorizontal, LTTextLineHorizontal\n\n   def extract_text_and_coordinates(pdf_path):\n       for page_layout in extract_pages(pdf_path):\n           for element in page_layout:\n               if isinstance(element, LTTextBoxHorizontal):\n                   for text_line in element:\n                       if isinstance(text_line, LTTextLineHorizontal):\n                           x, y, _, _ = text_line.bbox\n                           text = text_line.get_text().strip()\n                           print(f\"{int(x)}, {int(y)}, \\\"{text}\\\"\")\n\n   # Replace 'yourfile.pdf' with the path to your PDF file\n   extract_text_and_coordinates('yourfile.pdf')\n   ```\n\n3. **Explanation**:\n   - `extract_pages(pdf_path)`: This function from PDFMiner extracts pages from the PDF and provides a layout object for each page.\n   - `LTTextBoxHorizontal` and `LTTextLineHorizontal`: These classes represent boxes and lines of text in the PDF layout.\n   - `text_line.bbox`: This attribute gives the bounding box coordinates (x0, y0, x1, y1) of the text line. We are using `x0` and `y0` to denote the position of the text.\n   - `text_line.get_text().strip()`: This extracts the actual text content from the text line.\n\n4. **Output**: The script will print the x and y coordinates of each text line along with the text, similar to the format you specified.\n\nYou can run this script by saving it to a `.py` file and executing it with Python. Ensure that you provide the correct path to your PDF file when calling the `extract_text_and_coordinates` function. Adjust the script as needed depending on your specific requirements or the structure of your PDF documents."
