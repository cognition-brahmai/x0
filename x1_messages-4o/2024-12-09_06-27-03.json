The script produces the desired sounds but also clutters the shell with some errors like 'ALSA lib...', 'no socket connect', which makes it hard for me to read what was printed earlier. The exit code is 0, but there seems to be no documented option to turn off its verbosity. I want to silence it visually and keep the open shell clean for further interaction. How can I achieve this?\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\ntext = 'Hello World.'\nprint text\nsubprocess.call(['espeak', text])\n```"

This effectively silences any error messages that might clutter the shell. You can achieve this using Python's `subprocess` module by redirecting `stderr` to `subprocess.DEVNULL`.\n\nHere is your updated script:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\nimport os\n\ntext = 'Hello World.'\nprint text\n\n# Redirect stderr to devnull to silence error messages\nwith open(os.devnull, 'w') as devnull:\n    subprocess.call(['espeak', text], stderr=devnull)\n```\n\nThis will suppress any error messages that eSpeak might produce, leaving your shell clean for further interaction. The standard output will still be visible, and the speech will be produced as expected."
