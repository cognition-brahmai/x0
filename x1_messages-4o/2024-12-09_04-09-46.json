The existing code provides an accuracy metric, but it seems that I can't add a \"confusion matrix\" metric directly as it is not a streaming metric. I attempted to add the confusion matrix with some code, but I'm not getting a meaningful image in TensorBoard. The matrix should be normalized between 0-1 for a meaningful image. Can you help me understand the difference between streaming metrics and non-streaming ones? Also, how can I produce a meaningful confusion matrix and deal with multi-batch evaluation process?\n\n```python\nc_matrix = slim.metrics.confusion_matrix(predictions, labels)\n\n#These operations needed for image summary\nc_matrix = tf.cast(c_matrix, uint8)\nc_matrix = tf.expand_dims(c_matrix, 2)\nc_matrix = tf.expand_dims(c_matrix, 0)\n\nop = tf.image_summary(\"confusion matrix\", c_matrix, collections=[])\ntf.add_to_collection(tf.GraphKeys.SUMMARIES, op)\n```"

        "content": "In TensorFlow, the distinction between streaming and non-streaming metrics lies in how they handle data over multiple batches. Streaming metrics are designed to accumulate results over multiple batches and provide a final aggregated result, such as accuracy or precision over an entire dataset. Non-streaming metrics, on the other hand, compute results on a per-batch basis without accumulation.\n\nFor confusion matrices, which are typically computed over the entire dataset, you need to accumulate results across batches to get the final matrix. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n1. **Accumulate Confusion Matrix Across Batches:** You need to collect predictions and labels across all batches, compute the confusion matrix for each batch, and then sum them to get the final confusion matrix.\n\n2. **Normalize the Confusion Matrix for Visualization:** To visualize it as an image in TensorBoard, normalize the confusion matrix so that values are between 0 and 1.\n\nHere's an example of how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.contrib import slim\n\n# Assuming `predictions` and `labels` are your model predictions and true labels\nconfusion_matrix = tf.confusion_matrix(labels, predictions, num_classes=num_classes)\n\n# Accumulate confusion matrices\ntotal_cm = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([num_classes, num_classes], dtype=tf.int32), trainable=False)\nupdate_op = tf.assign_add(total_cm, confusion_matrix)\n\n# Normalize the confusion matrix\nnormalized_cm = tf.divide(tf.cast(total_cm, tf.float32), tf.reduce_sum(total_cm, axis=1, keepdims=True))\n\n# Prepare the confusion matrix for visualization\ncm_image = tf.expand_dims(normalized_cm, -1)\ncm_image = tf.expand_dims(cm_image, 0)\n\n# Add the confusion matrix image to TensorBoard\ntf.summary.image(\"confusion_matrix\", cm_image)\n\n# In your session, run the `update_op` in each batch to accumulate the confusion matrix\nwith tf.Session() as sess:\n    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())\n    \n    # ... your code for loading data and running batches ...\n    for batch in range(num_batches):\n        # Run your model predictions and labels fetching\n        sess.run(update_op, feed_dict={...})\n\n    # At the end of evaluation, log the confusion matrix\n    summary_writer = tf.summary.FileWriter(logdir, sess.graph)\n    cm_summary = sess.run(tf.summary.merge_all())\n    summary_writer.add_summary(cm_summary)\n    summary_writer.close()\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Use `tf.Variable` to accumulate the confusion matrix across batches.\n- Make sure `update_op` is run in each batch to add the current batch's confusion matrix to the total.\n- Normalize the confusion matrix by dividing each row by the sum of the row to ensure the values are between 0 and 1.\n- Use `tf.summary.image` to add the confusion matrix as an image to TensorBoard.\n\nThis approach ensures that you gather and visualize a meaningful confusion matrix over your entire evaluation dataset."
