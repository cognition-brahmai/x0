I've installed the SDK as per instructions found on the EmguCV website but I'm unable to run the samples. I receive an error which says \"The program can't start because nvcuda.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.\" I've tried adding the bin folder to my environment path and copying the dll's into my system32 folder, but it hasn't worked. I'm using EmguCV version 2.4.2.1777-windows-x64-gpu on Windows 8 with an AMD Radeon HD 6700 series graphics card. I suspect this might be due to not having an nVidia graphics card. If so, what can I do about it? I plan to try recompiling the source rather than using the downloaded .exe to see if that helps. Any suggestions?"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering indicates that the application is trying to use NVIDIA's CUDA for GPU acceleration, but your system lacks the necessary NVIDIA CUDA libraries because you have an AMD graphics card. Here's a step-by-step approach to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Use CPU Version:**\n   - Since you have an AMD graphics card, you should use the CPU version of EmguCV instead of the GPU version. The GPU version is optimized for NVIDIA's CUDA, which is not compatible with AMD cards.\n   - Download the EmguCV package that is intended for CPU processing.\n\n2. **Disable CUDA in Your Application:**\n   - If you have access to the source code of your application, you might be able to disable CUDA-specific code paths and rely solely on CPU-based processing.\n\n3. **Recompile EmguCV without CUDA:**\n   - If you want to continue using the current version, you can recompile EmguCV from source without CUDA support. Ensure that CUDA-related flags and dependencies are not included in the build process.\n   - You can find the source code on EmguCV's GitHub repository and follow their instructions for building from source.\n\n4. **Consider OpenCL:**\n   - Check if there's OpenCL support in the libraries you're using. OpenCL is a framework for writing programs that execute across heterogeneous platforms, including AMD and Intel GPUs.\n\n5. **Alternative Libraries:**\n   - If none of the above options are feasible, consider using other libraries that support AMD GPUs or are CPU-optimized, like Dlib or the CPU version of OpenCV.\n\n6. **Consult Documentation and Forums:**\n   - Look into EmguCV and OpenCV documentation for any AMD-specific instructions or forums where others might have faced similar issues.\n\nBy following the above steps, you should be able to configure your application to run without the need for the missing NVIDIA CUDA libraries."
