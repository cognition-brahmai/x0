I need to strip the whitespace from all the cells that contain stringlike objects, leaving the other cells untouched. I am currently using the following function:\n\n```python\ndef remove_whitespace( x ):\n    if isinstance( x, basestring ):\n        return x.strip()\n    else:\n        return x\n\nmy_data = my_data.applymap( remove_whitespace )\n```\n\nIs there a more efficient or more idiomatic way to achieve this in Pandas? I'm also wondering if there's a more efficient method that involves doing things column-wise. I've tried searching for a definitive answer, but most questions on this topic seem to be about stripping whitespace from column names, or they assume all cells are strings."

        "content": "To achieve the goal of stripping whitespace from all string-like objects in a DataFrame while leaving other types untouched, your current approach using `applymap` is quite effective for handling each cell individually. However, if you're looking for a more efficient or idiomatic approach, especially if your DataFrame is large, you might consider a column-wise approach. This method can be more efficient because it processes each column separately, taking advantage of vectorized operations for string-type columns.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfor column in my_data.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns:\n    my_data[column] = my_data[column].str.strip()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`select_dtypes(include=['object'])`:** This selects only the columns with data type `object`, which are typically used for string-like data in Pandas.\n\n2. **`my_data[column].str.strip()`:** This uses Pandas' `str` accessor to apply the `strip()` function to each element of the string columns. This operation is vectorized, meaning it is typically faster than applying a function to each element individually with `applymap`.\n\n### Advantages:\n\n- **Efficiency:** Vectorized operations are generally faster because they are implemented in C and avoid the Python-level loop overhead.\n  \n- **Readability:** This approach clearly shows that the operation is applied only to string-like columns, making the intent of the code more explicit.\n\nThis should give you a more idiomatic and potentially faster solution, especially with larger DataFrames."
