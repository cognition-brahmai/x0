        "content": "When using the `openpyxl` module in Python, if you encounter a situation where `cell.value` returns the formula instead of the calculated result, it's because `openpyxl` does not evaluate formulas. It only reads the formula as a string. To obtain the calculated result of a formula, you have a couple of options:\n\n1. **Pre-calculate values in Excel**: Ensure that the Excel file you are reading has been saved with the calculated values. `openpyxl` can read the cached value of a formula from the workbook. This means that before reading the Excel file with `openpyxl`, you should open it in Excel, make sure all formulas are calculated, and then save the file. \n\n2. **Use an alternative library**: If you need to evaluate the formulas dynamically within Python, consider using a library like `xlwings` or `pandas` with Excel as a backend, which can interface with Excel itself to get the calculated values.\n\nHere is how you can access the pre-calculated values using `openpyxl`:\n\n```python\nfrom openpyxl import load_workbook\n\n# Load the workbook\nworkbook = load_workbook('your_file.xlsx', data_only=True)\n\n# Select the active worksheet\nsheet = workbook.active\n\n# Access the cell value\ncell = sheet['A1']\nvalue = cell.value\n\nprint(f\"The calculated value of the cell is: {value}\")\n```\n\nIn this code, the `data_only=True` parameter when loading the workbook ensures `openpyxl` returns the cached value of the formula, not the formula itself. Remember, this only works if the Excel file was saved with the calculated values."
