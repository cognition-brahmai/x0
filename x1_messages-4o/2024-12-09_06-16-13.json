        "content": "What is the correct naming convention for a variable referencing a class in Python? For instance, in the below Python code, which one is more recommendable: `reference_to_class = MyClass` or `ReferenceToClass = MyClass`? I'm also wondering if there's a literature reference for this.\n\n```python\nclass MyClass(object):\n    pass\n\n# which one is correct?\nreference_to_class = MyClass\n\n# or\nReferenceToClass = MyClass\n```\n\nAdditionally, here is another example that resembles my situation:\n\n```python\n# cars.py\nclass Car(object):\n    pass\n\nclass Sedan(Car):\n    pass\n\nclass Coupe(Car):\n    pass\n\nclass StatonWagon(Car):\n    pass\n\nclass Van(Car):\n    pass\n\ndef get_car_class(slug, config):\n    return config.get(slug)\n\n# config.py\nCONFIG = {\n    'ford-mustang': Coupe,\n    'buick-riviera': Coupe,\n    'chevrolet-caprice': Sedan,\n    'chevy-wan' Van:\n    'ford-econoline': Van\n}\n\n# main.py\nfrom config.py import CONFIG\nfrom cars import get_car_class\n\nMyCarClass = get_car_class('buick-riviera')\n\nmy_car = MyCarClass()\n```\nI would prefer `ReferenceToClass`, so that it's clear it's a class reference and not an instance. But I would appreciate a literature reference."

        "content": "In Python, the naming conventions for variables, including those referencing classes, are guided by the PEP 8 style guide. According to PEP 8, variable names should generally follow the `lower_case_with_underscores` convention, while class names should follow the `CapitalizedWords` convention.\n\n### For your specific question:\n\n- **`reference_to_class = MyClass`**: This follows the typical variable naming convention as per PEP 8 and is usually preferred for variables, even if they reference a class.\n  \n- **`ReferenceToClass = MyClass`**: This uses the class naming convention, which can be misleading because it suggests that `ReferenceToClass` is a class itself rather than a reference to one.\n\n### Recommendation:\n\nIn the context of your code, using `reference_to_class` for a variable that holds a reference to a class is more in line with PEP 8 guidelines.\n\n### Literature Reference:\n\nPEP 8 is the primary reference for Python style conventions. You can find the relevant section under \"Naming Conventions\" in the PEP 8 document. It doesn\u2019t explicitly specify conventions for variables that reference classes, but the general guidelines for variable names apply.\n\nHere's a link to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for more detailed information.\n\n### Example:\n\nIn your main example, it would be more conventional to use:\n\n```python\nmy_car_class = get_car_class('buick-riviera', CONFIG)\n```\n\nThis follows the standard variable naming convention and avoids confusion with class names. The context in which the variable is used should make it clear enough that it references a class, especially when combined with meaningful function and variable names."
