In other words, elements such as `{% block %}` and references like `{{variable}}` do not receive any special treatment/ highlighting. The project is already configured as a Django project. Is there a way I can force PyCharm to use the Django template syntax highlighter for these files, or am I possibly doing something incorrectly?"

        "content": "It sounds like PyCharm is not correctly recognizing your Django templates, which can happen if certain configurations are not set up properly. Here are a few steps you can follow to ensure that Django template syntax highlighting works correctly:\n\n1. **Ensure Django Support is Enabled:**\n   - Go to `File` > `Settings` (or `PyCharm` > `Preferences` on macOS).\n   - Navigate to `Languages & Frameworks` > `Django`.\n   - Make sure that the \"Enable Django Support\" checkbox is ticked.\n\n2. **Set the Template Language:**\n   - Right-click on your project or the specific template folder in the `Project` tool window.\n   - Choose `Mark Directory as` > `Templates Folder`. This helps PyCharm understand that files in this directory are Django templates and not just plain HTML files.\n\n3. **Check File Associations:**\n   - Go to `File` > `Settings` > `Editor` > `File Types`.\n   - Under `Recognized File Types`, make sure that the file extension used for your Django templates (e.g., `.html`) is associated with `Django Template` and not plain `HTML`.\n\n4. **Install Django Plugin:**\n   - Ensure that the Django support plugin is installed and enabled in PyCharm. You can check this by going to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` and searching for \"Django.\"\n\n5. **Check Python Interpreter:**\n   - Make sure that your project is using the correct Python interpreter where Django is installed.\n   - Go to `File` > `Settings` > `Project: <Your Project Name>` > `Python Interpreter` and verify that the interpreter is set correctly.\n\n6. **Invalidate Caches/Restart:**\n   - Sometimes, simply invalidating the cache and restarting PyCharm can resolve such issues.\n   - Go to `File` > `Invalidate Caches / Restart` and select `Invalidate and Restart`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to get proper syntax highlighting for your Django templates in PyCharm. If the issue persists, consider checking PyCharm's documentation or reaching out to their support for further assistance."
