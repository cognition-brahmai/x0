        "content": "Jupyter Notebook itself does not have a built-in variable explorer like Spyder. However, you can achieve similar functionality by using extensions or additional tools. Here are a couple of ways to have a variable explorer-like feature in Jupyter:\n\n1. **JupyterLab Variable Inspector Extension**:\n   - If you use JupyterLab, you can install the \"Variable Inspector\" extension which provides a Spyder-like variable explorer.\n   - To install it, you can run the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:\n     ```\n     pip install lckr-jupyterlab-variableinspector\n     jupyter labextension install @lckr/jupyterlab-variableinspector\n     ```\n   - Once installed, you can find the Variable Inspector in the left sidebar of JupyterLab.\n\n2. **Nbextensions for Jupyter Notebook**:\n   - For the classic Jupyter Notebook, you can use the `jupyter_contrib_nbextensions` package, which includes a variable inspector extension.\n   - First, install the nbextensions package:\n     ```\n     pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions\n     jupyter contrib nbextension install --user\n     ```\n   - Then, enable the Variable Inspector extension:\n     ```\n     jupyter nbextension enable varInspector/main\n     ```\n   - After enabling it, you'll see a new tab in the Jupyter Notebook interface that shows the list of variables.\n\n3. **Using Magic Commands**:\n   - You can use the `%who`, `%whos`, and `%who_ls` magic commands in Jupyter Notebook to list variables in the current namespace. Though not as interactive, they provide a quick overview.\n   - For example, `%whos` will give you a list of all variables along with their types and data/info.\n\n4. **Jupyter Notebook Extensions**:\n   - Explore additional extensions that might offer similar capabilities. Jupyter Notebook extensions can often be found and configured via the Nbextensions tab in your Jupyter Notebook interface.\n\nThese options can help you manage and inspect your variables more conveniently while working in Jupyter."
