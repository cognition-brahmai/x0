For instance, this code works fine:\n\n```python\na, *rest = 1, 2, 3\n```\nBut when I try to use starred iterable unpacking in a return statement, like this:\n\n```python\ndef f():\n    rest = [2, 3]\n    return 1, *rest  # Invalid\n```\n\nIt gives me a syntax error. I can make it work by encapsulating the returned tuple in parentheses:\n\n```python\ndef f():\n    rest = [2, 3]\n    return (1, *rest)  # Valid\n```\n\nAlso, I noticed that using starred iterable unpacking in variable assignment works fine:\n\n```python\nt = 1, *rest\n```\n\nIs there any specific reason why this case is invalid syntax in Python 3.6 and 3.7?"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is due to how Python's syntax rules were designed for different contexts, particularly regarding starred unpacking. In Python 3.6 and 3.7, the language had some limitations with starred expressions in certain contexts, including return statements.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why you're encountering this issue:\n\n1. **Tuple Context and Starred Unpacking**: In Python, starred unpacking allows you to capture multiple elements from an iterable. While it's allowed in tuple assignment (like `a, *rest = 1, 2, 3`) and in lists (such as `[1, *rest]`), its use in return statements directly without parentheses wasn't permitted in Python 3.6 and 3.7.\n\n2. **Ambiguity in Syntax**: When you use `return 1, *rest` without parentheses, the parser might not easily distinguish between a tuple return and multiple return values. Parentheses explicitly define the context as a tuple, making the intention clear to the interpreter.\n\n3. **Language Evolution**: Python is an evolving language, and certain syntax features are often expanded or refined in later versions. In this case, starting from Python 3.8, the language was updated to allow starred unpacking directly in return statements without needing parentheses, as the parser and grammar were updated to handle these cases more gracefully.\n\n4. **Historical Constraints**: When Python 3.6 and 3.7 were developed, certain constraints in the language grammar made it more challenging to implement flexible starred unpacking in all contexts without potentially introducing ambiguity or complexity in the parser.\n\nIn summary, the need for parentheses in Python 3.6 and 3.7 is due to syntax limitations and parser constraints at the time. The language has since evolved, and if you use Python 3.8 or later, you should be able to use starred unpacking in return statements without parentheses."
