Start with the multiplication and division from left to right:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 4 = 12\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   12 \\div 6 = 2\n   \\]\n\n2. The expression now becomes \\(7 - 2 + 9\\).\n\n3. Next, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n   \\[\n   7 - 2 = 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   5 + 9 = 14\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the result of the expression \\(7 - 3 \\times 4 \\div 6 + 9\\) is \\(14\\)."
