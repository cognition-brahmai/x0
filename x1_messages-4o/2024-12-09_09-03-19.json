        "content": "To decrypt a ciphertext using a simple substitution cipher in Python, you need to have a mapping of each letter in the ciphertext to its corresponding plaintext letter. This mapping is often referred to as the key. If you don't have the key, you might need to perform frequency analysis or other techniques to deduce it.\n\nHere's a basic example to demonstrate how you can decrypt using a known key:\n\n```python\ndef decrypt(ciphertext, key):\n    # Create a dictionary to map each letter in the ciphertext to the plaintext\n    decryption_dict = {v: k for k, v in key.items()}\n    \n    # Decrypt the message\n    plaintext = \"\"\n    for char in ciphertext:\n        if char in decryption_dict:\n            plaintext += decryption_dict[char]\n        else:\n            # If character is not in the key (e.g., spaces, punctuation), keep it unchanged\n            plaintext += char\n    \n    return plaintext\n\n# Example usage\nciphertext = \"Wklv lv d whvw phvvdjh.\"\nkey = {\n    'a': 'x', 'b': 'y', 'c': 'z', 'd': 'a', 'e': 'b', 'f': 'c',\n    'g': 'd', 'h': 'e', 'i': 'f', 'j': 'g', 'k': 'h', 'l': 'i',\n    'm': 'j', 'n': 'k', 'o': 'l', 'p': 'm', 'q': 'n', 'r': 'o',\n    's': 'p', 't': 'q', 'u': 'r', 'v': 's', 'w': 't', 'x': 'u',\n    'y': 'v', 'z': 'w'\n}\n\nplaintext = decrypt(ciphertext, key)\nprint(\"Decrypted message:\", plaintext)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `key` dictionary defines a simple substitution mapping. The `decrypt` function reverses this mapping to convert the ciphertext back into plaintext. If you don't have the key, you'll need to analyze the frequency of letters in the ciphertext and compare it to the expected frequency in the language you're working with (e.g., English) to make educated guesses about the mapping."
