I am using the main example from the documentation provided. I am curious about whether a lower ranking value is better or vice versa. I noted that the features with the highest ranking value usually have the highest scores in `grid_scores_`. However, shouldn't a feature with a `ranking = 1` be ranked as the best in the group? This is what the documentation seems to suggest. Yet, in an example with some real data, the features with `ranking=1` have the lowest score while the feature with the highest ranking value has the highest score. Furthermore, in a figure in the documentation, the y axis reads \"number of misclassifications\", but it is plotting `grid_scores_` which used 'accuracy' as a scoring function. Shouldn't the y label read accuracy (the higher the better) instead of \"number of misclassifications\" (the lower the better)?"

        "content": "Let's break down your questions to understand the behavior of `RFECV` in scikit-learn and the interpretation of the `grid_scores_` and `ranking_`.\n\n1. **Ranking in RFECV**: \n   - In Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and its cross-validated variant RFECV, the `ranking_` attribute indicates the relative importance of the features. A ranking of `1` means that a feature is considered one of the most important, and it is retained in the optimal feature subset. Therefore, a lower ranking value (specifically `1`) is indeed better, indicating that the feature is part of the optimal set.\n   - Features with higher ranking values (greater than `1`) are considered less important and are eliminated in the process.\n\n2. **Grid Scores**:\n   - The `grid_scores_` attribute in RFECV represents the cross-validated scores (performance metric) of the model for different numbers of features. Higher `grid_scores_` indicate better model performance.\n   - If you're observing that features with `ranking=1` have lower scores in your real data scenario, it might be due to specific data characteristics or model behavior. It's possible that with fewer features (those with a `ranking=1`), the model is not performing as well as when more features are included, which can sometimes happen if important interactions between features are excluded.\n\n3. **Confusion in the Documentation**:\n   - The discrepancy you mentioned regarding the y-axis label in the documentation might be a misunderstanding or an oversight. If the scoring function is set to 'accuracy', then `grid_scores_` should indeed reflect accuracy values, where higher is better.\n   - It's possible that the figure in the documentation is plotting something specific to the example used, or there might be a mismatch between the y-axis label and the actual metric plotted.\n\nTo resolve these issues practically, ensure that:\n- You are correctly interpreting the metrics based on your scoring function.\n- You carefully examine the context in which the `grid_scores_` are being evaluated, and consider additional validation or diagnostic checks on your data to understand feature interactions and model behavior."
