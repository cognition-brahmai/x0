In a meeting, one partner might say, \"I know we have a lot of challenges ahead and success won't come overnight, but I believe in our vision and I'm in it for the long haul.\" This indicates that they are committed to working through the ups and downs and are dedicated to seeing the project through to fruition, regardless of how long it might take."
