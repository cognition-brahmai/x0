        "content": "Modifying a list during iteration can be safe if you're replacing or modifying the values themselves, rather than changing the structure of the list (like adding or removing elements). In your case, since you want to strip the strings within the list, you can safely do this during a for loop. Here's a way to achieve that using a for loop with indexing:\n\n```python\n# Your list of strings\nmy_list = [\"  hello  \", \"  world  \", \"  python  \"]\n\n# Loop through the list using indices\nfor i in range(len(my_list)):\n    # Strip each string and update the list\n    my_list[i] = my_list[i].strip()\n\nprint(my_list)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n['hello', 'world', 'python']\n```\n\nIn this example, we're iterating over the indices of the list and directly modifying the string at each index. This approach works because you're not altering the structure of the list\u2014just the contents of each element.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a list comprehension to achieve the same result, which is often more Pythonic:\n\n```python\n# Using list comprehension to strip strings\nmy_list = [s.strip() for s in my_list]\n\nprint(my_list)\n```\n\nThis will give you the same output and is generally more concise and considered a better practice in Python."
