I need to retrieve all the links in the `href=` property of all the `<a>` tags on the webpage \"http://psychoticelites.com/\". I have written a script that appears to be functional, but it returns the object address instead of the desired link. I attempted to use the `id` tag to get the value, but it was unsuccessful. Here is my current script:\n\n```python\nfrom selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys\n\ndriver = webdriver.Firefox()\ndriver.get(\"http://psychoticelites.com/\")\n\nassert \"Psychotic\" in driver.title\n\ncontinue_link = driver.find_element_by_tag_name('a')\nelem = driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\"//*[@href]\")\n#print(continue_link)\nprint(elem)\n```\nHow can I modify this script to return the actual links instead of the object address?"

        "content": "To retrieve the actual URLs from the `href` attributes of all `<a>` tags on the webpage, you need to iterate through the list of elements returned by `find_elements_by_xpath(\"//*[@href]\")` and extract the `href` attribute from each element. Here's how you can modify your script to achieve that:\n\n```python\nfrom selenium import webdriver\n\n# Initialize the WebDriver instance\ndriver = webdriver.Firefox()\n\n# Navigate to the web page\ndriver.get(\"http://psychoticelites.com/\")\n\n# Check the page title to ensure the correct page is loaded\nassert \"Psychotic\" in driver.title\n\n# Find all elements with an 'href' attribute using XPath\nelements = driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\"//*[@href]\")\n\n# Extract the 'href' attribute from each element and print the URLs\nfor elem in elements:\n    link = elem.get_attribute('href')\n    print(link)\n\n# Close the browser after retrieving the links\ndriver.quit()\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- Replaced `continue_link` with `elements` to store all elements containing an `href` attribute.\n- Used a loop to iterate through each element in `elements` and extracted the `href` attribute using `elem.get_attribute('href')`.\n- Printed each extracted link to the console.\n\nThis script will now print all the links found on the webpage. Make sure you have the necessary WebDriver executable (e.g., geckodriver for Firefox) in your system PATH or specify its location in the WebDriver initialization."
