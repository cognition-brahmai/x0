For instance, when I try to use `pip install seaborn`, it doesn't work. As a workaround, I've downloaded the tar.gz file of the packages I need and extracted its contents. However, I am unsure of how to proceed with the installation from here. I noticed a \"setup\" file in the extracted contents, but I'm not sure how to use it. Could someone explain how to install Python packages from a tar.gz file without using `pip install` on a Windows machine?"

        "content": "To install a Python package from a tar.gz file without using `pip install`, you can manually use the setup script that comes with the package. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you install the package on a Windows machine:\n\n1. **Extract the tar.gz File:**\n   - You mentioned you've already extracted the contents of the tar.gz file. Ensure you have all the files extracted into a directory.\n\n2. **Open Command Prompt:**\n   - Navigate to the directory where you've extracted the package contents. You can do this by using the `cd` command in the Command Prompt. For example:\n     ```bash\n     cd path\\to\\extracted\\package\n     ```\n\n3. **Run the Setup Script:**\n   - In the directory, you should see a file named `setup.py`. This script is used to install the package. Execute the following command to install the package:\n     ```bash\n     python setup.py install\n     ```\n   - Ensure that your Python installation is in your system's PATH, so you can run the `python` command from any directory.\n\n4. **Verify the Installation:**\n   - After the installation completes, you can verify it by trying to import the package in a Python interactive shell:\n     ```python\n     import seaborn\n     ```\n\nIf you encounter any permission issues, you might want to run the Command Prompt as an administrator. Additionally, ensure that all dependencies required by the package are already installed, as manual installation using `setup.py` doesn't automatically resolve dependencies like `pip` does.\n\nIf the package has additional dependencies, you may need to download and install them manually in the same way.\n\nThis process should allow you to install Python packages without using `pip`, overcoming your network constraints."
