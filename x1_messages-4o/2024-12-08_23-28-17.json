        "content": "Certainly! The idiom \"to wear one's heart on one's sleeve\" means to openly show one's emotions and feelings rather than hiding them. It suggests that the person's emotional state is easily visible to others, much like a heart worn on a sleeve would be easily seen.\n\nHere's how you can use it in a sentence:\n\n[English Language]\n\"John tends to wear his heart on his sleeve, so it's easy to tell when he's upset.\"\n\nAnd here's an example of a C# code snippet that uses this idiom in a string variable:\n\n[C# code]\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        string idiomUsage = \"Sarah is known to wear her heart on her sleeve, expressing her feelings openly.\";\n        Console.WriteLine(idiomUsage);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this C# example, the idiom is stored in the `idiomUsage` string variable and then printed to the console. This demonstrates how you can incorporate the idiom into a programming context."
