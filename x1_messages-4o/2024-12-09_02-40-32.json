However, when this is converted to a list, it results in `[False, True, 2]`. I am confused as to why the key '1' is not present in the list. Furthermore, when I print `exDict.items()`, the output is `[(False, 1), (True, 'a'), (2, 'b')]`. I am unsure about what is happening here, can anyone explain this to me?"

        "content": "In Python, dictionaries cannot have duplicate keys, and keys must be unique. If you attempt to create a dictionary with duplicate keys, the latest value for a given key will overwrite any previous ones.\n\nIn your dictionary:\n\n```python\nexDict = {True: 0, False: 1, 1: 'a', 2: 'b'}\n```\n\nHere's what happens:\n\n1. **Boolean and Integer Equivalence:** In Python, `True` and `False` are actually subclasses of `int`, with `True` equivalent to `1` and `False` equivalent to `0`. Therefore, when you use `1` as a key, it is considered equivalent to `True`. This means that when you define `1: 'a'` after `True: 0`, it overwrites the previous `True` key-value pair.\n\n2. **Resulting Dictionary:** After processing, your dictionary effectively looks like this:\n   - `False: 1`  (Since `False` is equivalent to `0`)\n   - `True: 'a'` (Since `True` is equivalent to `1`, and `1: 'a'` overwrites `True: 0`)\n   - `2: 'b'`\n\n3. **Output of `exDict.keys()`:** When you convert the keys to a list, you get `[False, True, 2]`. This represents the current state of the keys in your dictionary.\n\n4. **Output of `exDict.items()`:** The items in the dictionary reflect the last assigned values, resulting in `[(False, 1), (True, 'a'), (2, 'b')]`.\n\nThis behavior showcases how Python handles keys that are of types which can have equivalent integer representations. It's a good practice to avoid using `True` and `False` as dictionary keys if you also plan to use integers like `1` and `0` to avoid this type of confusion."
