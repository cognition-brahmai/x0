For instance, if I have the following lists:\n\n```python\nsomelists = [\n   [1, 2, 3],\n   ['a', 'b'],\n   [4, 5]\n]\n```\n\nI want to generate the following output:\n\n```python\n[(1, 'a', 4), (1, 'a', 5), (1, 'b', 4), (1, 'b', 5), (2, 'a', 4), (2, 'a', 5) ...]\n```"

        "content": "To obtain the Cartesian product of a group of lists in Python, you can use the `itertools.product` function from the `itertools` module. This function computes the Cartesian product of input iterables, which is exactly what you need. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nsomelists = [\n    [1, 2, 3],\n    ['a', 'b'],\n    [4, 5]\n]\n\n# Use itertools.product to get the Cartesian product\ncartesian_product = list(itertools.product(*somelists))\n\n# Print the result\nprint(cartesian_product)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output the Cartesian product as a list of tuples:\n\n```\n[(1, 'a', 4), (1, 'a', 5), (1, 'b', 4), (1, 'b', 5), (2, 'a', 4), (2, 'a', 5), (2, 'b', 4), (2, 'b', 5), (3, 'a', 4), (3, 'a', 5), (3, 'b', 4), (3, 'b', 5)]\n```\n\nThis code uses the unpacking operator `*` to pass each list in `somelists` as separate arguments to `itertools.product`. The function then returns an iterator of tuples that represent the Cartesian product, which is converted to a list for easier viewing."
