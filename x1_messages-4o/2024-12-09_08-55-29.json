Here's a simple example of how you can do it:\n\n```r\n# Define a function to calculate the sum of elements in a vector\ncalculate_sum <- function(numbers_vector) {\n  # Use the built-in sum() function to calculate the sum\n  total_sum <- sum(numbers_vector)\n  return(total_sum)\n}\n\n# Example usage\n# Create a vector of numbers\nmy_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\n# Call the function and print the result\nresult <- calculate_sum(my_vector)\ncat(\"The sum of the elements in the vector is:\", result)\n```\n\nIn this script:\n\n- We define a function `calculate_sum` that takes a vector as an argument.\n- Inside the function, we use the `sum()` function, which is built into R, to calculate the sum of the numbers in the vector.\n- We then return the result.\n- Finally, we create an example vector `my_vector`, call the `calculate_sum` function with this vector, and print out the result.\n\nYou can replace `my_vector` with any other vector of numbers to calculate its sum."
