Here is a sample of the code that I am using:\n\n```python\ndef apply_op():\n    x, y, z = [0.5, 0.25, 0.75]\n    op = \"x,y,z\"\n    return [eval(o) for o in op.split(\",\")]\nprint(apply_op())\n```\n\nWhen I run this code, I get the following error:\n\n```python\n\u25b6 python --version\nPython 3.4.3\n\u25b6 python eval.py\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"eval.py\", line 7, in &lt;module&gt;\n    print(apply_op())\n  File \"eval.py\", line 5, in apply_op\n    return [eval(o) % 1 for o in op.split(\",\")]\n  File \"eval.py\", line 5, in &lt;listcomp&gt;\n    return [eval(o) % 1 for o in op.split(\",\")]\n  File \"&lt;string&gt;\", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\nNameError: name 'x' is not defined\n```\n\nThe strange thing is that this same code works perfectly in Python 2:\n\n```python\n\u25b6 python --version\nPython 2.7.8\n\u25b6 python eval.py\n[0.5, 0.25, 0.75]\n```\n\nIf I move the eval calls outside of the list comprehension, then the problem seems to go away:\n\n```python\ndef apply_op():\n    x, y, z = [0.5, 0.25, 0.75]\n    return [eval(\"x\"), eval(\"y\"), eval(\"z\")]\n```\n\nIs this a bug in Python 3 or is this the intended behavior?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The behavior you're encountering is not a bug but rather a change in how Python 3 handles the scope for variables used inside `eval` within a list comprehension. In Python 2, list comprehensions have their own scope, but the variables from the outer function's scope can be accessed directly. However, in Python 3, list comprehensions have their own scope, and the variables from the outer function are not directly accessible within `eval` unless explicitly provided.\n\nTo resolve the issue in Python 3, you can pass the local variables to `eval` using its `locals` parameter. Here's how you can modify your code to work in Python 3:\n\n```python\ndef apply_op():\n    x, y, z = [0.5, 0.25, 0.75]\n    op = \"x,y,z\"\n    return [eval(o, {}, locals()) for o in op.split(\",\")]\n\nprint(apply_op())\n```\n\nBy providing `locals()` as the third argument to `eval`, you ensure that the local variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are available within the scope of the `eval` call inside the list comprehension. This should resolve the `NameError` you're encountering."
