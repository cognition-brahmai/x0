Here's one way to do it:\n\n```java\npublic class PrincessStory {\n   public static void main(String[] args) {\n      boolean curse = true;\n      boolean frog = true;\n      boolean fog = true;\n      boolean prince = true;\n      while (curse) {\n         if (frog && fog) {\n            System.out.println(\"The curse is lifted!\");\n            prince = false;\n            break;\n         }\n         else {\n            System.out.println(\"The princess must find a frog and kiss it in the fog.\");\n            break;\n         }\n      }\n      if (!prince) {\n         System.out.println(\"The princess and her true love lived happily ever after.\");\n      }\n      else {\n         System.out.println(\"The prince was not meant to be her true love after all.\");\n         \n         // New twist: The princess realizes her true calling\n         System.out.println(\"The princess embarked on a journey of self-discovery.\");\n         System.out.println(\"She traveled the world, helping those in need and finding happiness in her adventures.\");\n         System.out.println(\"Eventually, she became known as the wise queen who brought peace to the land.\");\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\n\nIn this version, instead of being tied to the prince, the princess discovers her own strengths and purpose, leading to a fulfilling life full of adventures and wisdom. This adds a modern twist to the traditional tale, emphasizing personal growth and independence."
