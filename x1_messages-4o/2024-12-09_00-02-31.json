The sentence in question is \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\" Your task is to select only the letters that occur multiple times in the sentence and create a novel string by sorting them in alphabetical order. However, there's a challenge - you must use a sophisticated approach that guarantees that each letter is counted only once, even if it appears more than twice in the original sentence. Can you crack this intricate puzzle with your intellect?"

        "content": "Certainly! Let's tackle this linguistic puzzle step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the Letters**: First, we'll identify the letters that occur multiple times in the sentence \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\n\n2. **Count the Frequency**: The sentence has the following frequency of letters:\n   - 't': 2\n   - 'h': 2\n   - 'e': 3\n   - 'o': 4\n   - 'u': 2\n   - 'r': 2\n\n3. **Select the Letters**: We select only those letters which occur more than once: 't', 'h', 'e', 'o', 'u', 'r'.\n\n4. **Sort Alphabetically**: Finally, we'll sort these letters alphabetically: 'e', 'h', 'o', 'r', 't', 'u'.\n\n5. **Formulate the String**: The resulting string is \"ehortu\".\n\nSo, the answer to the puzzle is the string \"ehortu\", with each selected letter counted only once and arranged in alphabetical order."
