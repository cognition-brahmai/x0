The first task asks me to use Python Set Comprehension to generate a set of all of the prime numbers that are less than 100. The second task is to use a Python Set Comprehension to generate a set of ordered pairs consisting of all of the prime pairs consisting of primes less than 100. A Prime Pair is defined as a pair of consecutive odd numbers that are both prime. I was able to solve the first task using the following code:\n\n```python\nr= {x for x in range(2, 101) \nif not any(x % y == 0 for y in range(2, x))} \n```\n\nHowever, I'm having trouble with the second task. I think I need to take the Cartesian product of the set r with something but I'm not sure what that something should be. I tried using the following code but it only gets me somewhat close to the solution, as it doesn't only get the consecutive pairs.\n\n```python\ncart = { (x, y) for x in r for y in r\n     if x < y }\n```\n\nHow can I modify this to only get the consecutive prime pairs?"

        "content": "You're on the right track with using set comprehension! To find consecutive prime pairs, you need to ensure that the pairs are not only prime but also consecutive odd numbers. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n1. Use your existing set `r` of prime numbers less than 100.\n2. Iterate over the sorted set `r` and check for consecutive prime numbers.\n3. Use set comprehension to create pairs only if they are consecutive.\n\nHere's the code to generate the set of ordered pairs of consecutive prime numbers:\n\n```python\n# Generate the set of prime numbers less than 100\nr = {x for x in range(2, 101) if not any(x % y == 0 for y in range(2, x))}\n\n# Generate the set of consecutive prime pairs\nprime_pairs = {(x, y) for x, y in zip(sorted(r), sorted(r)[1:]) if y - x == 2}\n\nprint(prime_pairs)\n```\n\nThis code uses `zip(sorted(r), sorted(r)[1:])` to iterate over consecutive pairs in the sorted set of primes. It then checks if the difference between the two numbers is 2, which is the condition for consecutive odd primes. This will give you the set of prime pairs as defined."
