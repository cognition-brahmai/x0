I have a grouped bar chart created from seaborn countplot as follows:\n```python\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set(style=\"darkgrid\")\ntitanic = sns.load_dataset(\"titanic\")\nax = sns.countplot(x=\"class\", hue=\"who\", data=titanic)\n```\nThe chart looks like this: ![Chart](https://i.stack.imgur.com/b1m5F.png)\nI want to display the ratio of each group to the total for each class on top of their respective bars. For example, for \"First\" I want to display the ratio of total First men to total First, total First women to total First, and total First children to total First."

        "content": "To display percentages on top of the bars in your seaborn count plot, you can iterate over the bars and annotate them with the corresponding percentage. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the dataset\ntitanic = sns.load_dataset(\"titanic\")\n\n# Create the count plot\nsns.set(style=\"darkgrid\")\nax = sns.countplot(x=\"class\", hue=\"who\", data=titanic)\n\n# Calculate the total count for each class\nclass_counts = titanic['class'].value_counts()\n\n# Iterate over each patch (bar) in the plot\nfor p in ax.patches:\n    # Get the height of each bar\n    height = p.get_height()\n    \n    # Get the total count for the current class\n    total = class_counts[p.get_x() + p.get_width()/2]\n    \n    # Calculate the percentage\n    percentage = 100 * height / total\n    \n    # Annotate the percentage on the bar\n    ax.annotate(f'{percentage:.1f}%', \n                (p.get_x() + p.get_width() / 2., height), \n                ha='center', va='bottom', \n                fontsize=10, color='black', weight='bold')\n\n# Adjust the plot\nplt.title('Percentage of Each Group within Each Class')\nplt.ylabel('Count')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Class Counts**: We first calculate the total count for each class using `value_counts()` and store it in `class_counts`.\n- **Iterate Over Bars**: We iterate over each bar in the plot using `ax.patches`.\n- **Calculate Percentage**: For each bar, we calculate the percentage as `(height of bar / total count for the class) * 100`.\n- **Annotate**: We annotate each bar with its percentage using `ax.annotate()`, positioning it at the center top of each bar.\n\nThis script will add the percentage labels on top of each bar, showing the ratio of each group within its respective class."
