I've tried using the following code:\n```python\n{{quotes|withlinebreaks\\n}}\n```\nBut it's not working. How can I print line breaks in the Python Django template?"

        "content": "To display line breaks in a Django template, you can use the `linebreaks` or `linebreaksbr` filter provided by Django's template system. These filters convert line breaks in your text into HTML `<p>` or `<br>` tags, respectively.\n\nHere is how you can use `linebreaksbr` to achieve your desired output:\n\nFirst, ensure your dictionary is passed to the template context in your view:\n\n```python\n# views.py\nfrom django.shortcuts import render\n\ndef quotes_view(request):\n    context = {\n        'quotes': u'Live before you die.\\n\\n\"Dream as if you\\'ll live forever, live as if you\\'ll die today\"\\n\\n\"Love one person, take care of them until you die. You know, raise kids. Have a good life. Be a good friend. Try to be completely who you are, figure out what you personally love and go after it with everything you\\'ve got no matter how much it takes.\" -Angelina Jolie.'\n    }\n    return render(request, 'your_template.html', context)\n```\n\nThen, in your Django template, use the `linebreaksbr` filter:\n\n```html\n<!-- your_template.html -->\n{{ quotes|linebreaksbr }}\n```\n\nWith `linebreaksbr`, each newline (`\\n`) in your text will be converted to a `<br>` tag, preserving the line breaks in the HTML output. If you want the text to be wrapped in `<p>` tags instead, you could use `linebreaks`:\n\n```html\n{{ quotes|linebreaks }}\n```\n\nThis will wrap paragraphs separated by double newlines in `<p>` tags and convert single newlines to `<br>` tags. Choose the filter that best suits your needs based on how you want the line breaks to appear in your rendered HTML."
