I'm currently using Python 3.3.2 and Tk 8.5. Am I using the incorrect version of Python or is there a mistake in my import statement? Is there an alternative module I could use in my current version?"

This is part of the changes made to the `tkinter` package to ensure consistency and to follow Python's naming conventions.\n\nHere is how you can import and use the `messagebox` in Python 3:\n\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\nfrom tkinter import messagebox\n\nroot = tk.Tk()\nroot.withdraw()  # This hides the main window\n\n# Example usage\nmessagebox.showinfo(\"Title\", \"This is an info message box\")\n```\n\nMake sure you have `tkinter` installed and correctly set up in your Python environment. Most standard Python distributions include `tkinter` by default, so you shouldn't need to install it separately unless you have a custom setup."
