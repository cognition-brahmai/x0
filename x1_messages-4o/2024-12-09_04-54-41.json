Both functions seem to produce the same results, as shown in the following example:\n\n<pre><code>In [30]: np.mean([1, 2, 3])\nOut[30]: 2.0\n\nIn [31]: np.average([1, 2, 3])\nOut[31]: 2.0\n</code></pre>\n\nWhy are there two different functions for this?"

        "content": "In NumPy, both `np.mean()` and `np.average()` are used to calculate the average of an array, but there are some key differences between them:\n\n1. **Basic Functionality**:\n   - `np.mean()`: This function computes the arithmetic mean along the specified axis. It is straightforward and only calculates the mean of the input array or along a specified axis.\n   - `np.average()`: This function computes the weighted average if the `weights` parameter is provided. It can calculate the simple average just like `np.mean()`, but its additional capability is to compute a weighted average when weights are specified.\n\n2. **Weights**:\n   - `np.mean()` does not have the capability to handle weights.\n   - `np.average()` allows you to pass a `weights` parameter. By providing weights, you can calculate a weighted mean, which is useful if you want to give different importance to different elements.\n\n3. **Use Case**:\n   - Use `np.mean()` when you need a simple arithmetic mean without any additional complexity.\n   - Use `np.average()` when you need to calculate a weighted average or when you might need the flexibility to switch between simple and weighted averages.\n\nHere's an example to illustrate the use of weights with `np.average()`:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndata = [1, 2, 3]\nweights = [0.1, 0.3, 0.6]\n\n# Simple mean\nmean = np.mean(data)\nprint(\"Mean:\", mean)  # Output: 2.0\n\n# Weighted average\nweighted_average = np.average(data, weights=weights)\nprint(\"Weighted Average:\", weighted_average)  # Output: 2.5\n```\n\nIn the example above, `np.mean()` calculates the simple average of the list `[1, 2, 3]`, while `np.average()` calculates a weighted average using the weights `[0.1, 0.3, 0.6]`. The weighted average places more emphasis on the value `3` because it has the highest weight."
