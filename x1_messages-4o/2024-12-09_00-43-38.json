        "content": "To implement a Finite State Machine (FSM) that determines if a binary number has an even number of 0s, you can use any programming language you're comfortable with. Let's consider Python for this example, as it is widely used and easy to understand.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to implementing the FSM:\n\n1. **Define States**: You need two states:\n   - `S0`: Represents that the number of 0s encountered so far is even.\n   - `S1`: Represents that the number of 0s encountered so far is odd.\n\n2. **Define the State Transition Table**:\n   - From `S0`, if you read a `0`, transition to `S1`. If you read a `1`, stay in `S0`.\n   - From `S1`, if you read a `0`, transition to `S0`. If you read a `1`, stay in `S1`.\n\n3. **Determine the Accepting State**: The machine should accept if you are in `S0` after processing the entire input, as this indicates an even number of 0s.\n\n4. **Implement the FSM**: Here's how you can implement it in Python:\n\n```python\nclass FSM:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.state = 'S0'  # Initial state\n\n    def transition(self, input_char):\n        if self.state == 'S0':\n            if input_char == '0':\n                self.state = 'S1'\n            elif input_char == '1':\n                self.state = 'S0'\n        elif self.state == 'S1':\n            if input_char == '0':\n                self.state = 'S0'\n            elif input_char == '1':\n                self.state = 'S1'\n\n    def is_accepted(self):\n        return self.state == 'S0'\n\ndef check_even_zeros(binary_string):\n    fsm = FSM()\n    for char in binary_string:\n        fsm.transition(char)\n    return fsm.is_accepted()\n\n# Example Usage\nbinary_input = '110100'\nif check_even_zeros(binary_input):\n    print(f\"The binary number {binary_input} has an even number of 0s.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"The binary number {binary_input} does not have an even number of 0s.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **FSM Class**: This class maintains the current state and has a method `transition` to change the state based on the input character.\n- **is_accepted Method**: This checks if the final state is `S0` (indicating an even number of 0s).\n- **check_even_zeros Function**: This function initializes the FSM and processes each character of the input string to determine if the number of 0s is even.\n\nYou can adapt this example to other programming languages by following the same logic and syntax structure relevant to the language of your choice."
