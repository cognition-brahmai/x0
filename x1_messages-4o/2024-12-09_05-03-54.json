However, I am encountering an issue when I try to evaluate the predicted results using the `accuracy_score` metric. My true data is a binary array, but my predicted data is a set of continuous values. Here's the code I'm using: `accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred, normalize=False)`. But I get an error message saying `ValueError: Can't handle mix of binary and continuous target`. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is because `accuracy_score` is designed for classification problems with discrete class labels, whereas `LinearRegression` outputs continuous values. To compute accuracy for a binary classification task, you need to convert the continuous predictions into binary class labels.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this:\n\n1. **Thresholding**: Determine a threshold to convert continuous predictions into binary predictions. A common threshold is 0.5, but this can be adjusted based on your specific problem and data distribution.\n\n2. **Convert Predictions**: Use the threshold to convert your continuous predictions into binary values (0 or 1).\n\nHere's an example of how you can do this:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Assuming y_true is your binary true labels\n# and y_pred_continuous is the continuous predictions from LinearRegression\n\n# Example data\ny_true = np.array([0, 1, 0, 1, 1])\ny_pred_continuous = np.array([0.3, 0.7, 0.4, 0.6, 0.9])\n\n# Define a threshold\nthreshold = 0.5\n\n# Convert continuous predictions to binary\ny_pred_binary = (y_pred_continuous >= threshold).astype(int)\n\n# Calculate accuracy\naccuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred_binary)\n\nprint(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')\n```\n\nThis will give you the accuracy of your model's predictions after converting them to binary values. Adjust the threshold if needed to better fit your data."
