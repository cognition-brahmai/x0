How would I go about this?\n\n![heatmap_with_lines](https://i.stack.imgur.com/lO3uP.png)"

        "content": "To emphasize the quarters of the year on your seaborn heatmap, you can add lines to separate these groups. You can achieve this by using `ax.hlines()` and `ax.vlines()` to draw horizontal and vertical lines at the appropriate positions on the heatmap. Here's how you can modify your code to include these lines:\n\n```python\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Set seaborn style\nsns.set()\n\n# Load and pivot the flights dataset\nflights = sns.load_dataset(\"flights\")\nflights = flights.pivot(\"month\", \"year\", \"passengers\")\n\n# Create a heatmap\nax = sns.heatmap(flights, cbar=False)\n\n# Define the positions where you want to add lines\n# Since the months are indexed from 0 to 11, quarters end at 2, 5, 8\nquarter_positions = [3, 6, 9]\n\n# Draw horizontal lines to separate quarters\nfor pos in quarter_positions:\n    ax.hlines(y=pos, xmin=0, xmax=len(flights.columns), color='white', linewidth=2)\n\n# Draw vertical lines to separate years (quarters)\nax.vlines(x=quarter_positions, ymin=0, ymax=len(flights.index), color='white', linewidth=2)\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`ax.hlines(y=pos, ...)`**: Draws horizontal lines at the y-positions specified in `quarter_positions` which separate the months into quarters.\n- **`ax.vlines(x=quarter_positions, ...)`**: Draws vertical lines at the x-positions specified in `quarter_positions` which can be used to separate sections if there are multiple years.\n- **`color='white'` and `linewidth=2`**: These parameters set the color and thickness of the lines. You can adjust these to suit your preference.\n\nThis code assumes that your dataset is structured such that the months are in order and that each quarter consists of three months. Adjust the `quarter_positions` list if your data structure differs."
