In one of my submodules, I have an import statement in the `__init__.py` file that looks like this: `from .my_class import MyClass`. The purpose of this line is to allow me to import MyClass from the submodule using `from somemodule import MyClass`, instead of the longer `from somemodule.my_class import MyClass`. However, this seems to be causing a PEP8 violation. Is there a way to retain this import functionality while still adhering to PEP8 guidelines?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely due to the relative import style or possibly an unused import warning from the flake8 tool. To adhere to PEP8 guidelines while maintaining the import functionality you want, you can consider the following approaches:\n\n1. **Absolute Imports**: PEP8 recommends using absolute imports. However, in your case, since you're within a package and want to keep the flexibility, using a relative import like `from .my_class import MyClass` is acceptable as it clearly indicates that `my_class` is a sibling module in the same package.\n\n2. **Unused Import Warning**: If flake8 is raising an issue because `MyClass` is imported but not used within `__init__.py`, you can suppress this specific warning by using flake8's configuration options. You can add a `# noqa` comment at the end of the import line to tell flake8 to ignore warnings for that line:\n\n   ```python\n   from .my_class import MyClass  # noqa: F401\n   ```\n\n   Here, `F401` is the specific code for \"imported but unused\" warnings in flake8.\n\n3. **Explicit Export**: To make it clear that `MyClass` is part of the submodule's public API, you can add it to the `__all__` list in your `__init__.py` file. This is a good practice to explicitly declare what the module exports:\n\n   ```python\n   from .my_class import MyClass\n\n   __all__ = ['MyClass']\n   ```\n\n4. **Flake8 Configuration**: If you have a lot of these cases, you might want to configure flake8 to ignore `F401` warnings globally by adding this to your `setup.cfg` or `.flake8` configuration file:\n\n   ```ini\n   [flake8]\n   ignore = F401\n   ```\n\n   Be careful with this approach as it will ignore all unused import warnings, which might hide genuine issues elsewhere in your code.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to keep your code PEP8-compliant while preserving the import functionality you desire."
