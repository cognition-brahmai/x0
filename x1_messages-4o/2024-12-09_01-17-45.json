I'm trying to update a dictionary called `award_dict` within a function and return it. However, I find the process cumbersome and would rather do it in a more concise way, similar to how chaining is done in jQuery.\n\nHere is the code I'm working with:\n\n```python\naward_dict = {\n    \"url\" : \"http://facebook.com\",\n    \"imageurl\" : \"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3431/3939267074_feb9eb19b1_o.png\",\n    \"count\" : 1,\n}\n\ndef award(name, count, points, desc_string, my_size, parent) :\n    if my_size > count :\n        a = {\n            \"name\" : name,\n            \"description\" : desc_string % count,\n            \"points\" : points,\n            \"parent_award\" : parent,\n        }\n        a.update(award_dict)\n        return self.add_award(a, siteAlias, alias).award\n```\n\nWhat I would prefer to do is:\n\n```python\nreturn self.add_award({\n    \"name\" : name,\n    \"description\" : desc_string % count,\n    \"points\" : points,\n    \"parent_award\" : parent,\n}.update(award_dict), siteAlias, alias).award\n```\n\nCan anyone explain why this is not possible in Python?"

        "content": "The `update()` method in Python does not return the dictionary object itself because it is designed to modify the dictionary in place. This behavior is typical of many in-place modification methods in Python, such as `list.append()`, `list.extend()`, or `set.update()`. These methods return `None` to emphasize that they modify the existing object rather than creating and returning a new one. This design decision reflects Python's philosophy of clarity and explicitness over method chaining for in-place modifications.\n\nIf you want to achieve a more concise syntax similar to method chaining, you can create a utility function or use dictionary unpacking to merge dictionaries. Here's how you can refactor your code using dictionary unpacking:\n\n```python\ndef award(name, count, points, desc_string, my_size, parent, siteAlias, alias):\n    if my_size > count:\n        a = {\n            \"name\": name,\n            \"description\": desc_string % count,\n            \"points\": points,\n            \"parent_award\": parent,\n            **award_dict  # Use dictionary unpacking to merge dictionaries\n        }\n        return self.add_award(a, siteAlias, alias).award\n```\n\nIn this example, the `**award_dict` syntax is used to unpack the `award_dict` dictionary and merge it into the new dictionary `a`. This approach provides a concise and readable way to combine dictionaries without altering the original `update()` method behavior.\n\nThis solution aligns with Python's design principles, providing a clear and explicit way to achieve the desired functionality without modifying the core language behavior."
