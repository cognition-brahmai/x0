For instance, when I run `re.sub('a(b)','d','abc')`, I get the output as `dc`, but I was expecting `adc`. Why does `re.sub` replace the entire capturing group, rather than just the group '(b)'?"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing with `re.sub` in Python is due to how the function is designed to operate. The `re.sub` function is intended to replace occurrences of the entire pattern with the specified replacement string. When you use a pattern like `'a(b)'`, it matches the entire substring `'ab'` in the target string `'abc'`, not just the capturing group `(b)`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Pattern Matching**: The pattern `'a(b)'` is composed of two parts: the literal `'a'` and the capturing group `(b)`. The pattern `'a(b)'` matches the substring `'ab'` in `'abc'`.\n\n2. **Replacement**: Once a match is found, `re.sub` replaces the entire matched substring (`'ab'` in this case) with the replacement string `'d'`.\n\n3. **Capturing Groups**: Capturing groups are useful when you want to utilize parts of the matched text in the replacement string, which you can do by using backreferences like `\\1`, `\\2`, etc., in the replacement string.\n\nIf you want to replace only the part captured by the group `(b)`, you can use backreferences in the replacement string. For example:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nresult = re.sub('a(b)', r'a\\1d', 'abc')\nprint(result)  # Outputs: 'abdc'\n```\n\nIn this example, `\\1` refers to the text captured by the first capturing group `(b)`, which is `'b'`. The replacement string `'a\\1d'` effectively becomes `'abd'`, and thus, `'abc'` is transformed into `'abdc'`.\n\nIf you want to replace only the captured group while keeping the rest of the match, you need to incorporate parts of the original match in your replacement logic using these backreferences."
