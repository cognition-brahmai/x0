        "content": "To create a simple front-end website with two text boxes and a submit button using React, you can follow these steps. This involves setting up a basic React application and implementing a form with the required elements.\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Your React Project\n\nFirst, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can create a new React project using Create React App by running the following commands in your terminal:\n\n```bash\nnpx create-react-app my-react-app\ncd my-react-app\nnpm start\n```\n\nThis will create a new React project named `my-react-app` and start a development server.\n\n### Step 2: Create the Form Component\n\nNavigate to the `src` folder of your React project and open the `App.js` file. You can create a simple form component with two text boxes and a submit button as follows:\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [input1, setInput1] = useState('');\n  const [input2, setInput2] = useState('');\n\n  const handleSubmit = (event) => {\n    event.preventDefault();\n    alert(`Input 1: ${input1}, Input 2: ${input2}`);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div style={{ padding: '20px' }}>\n      <h1>Simple Form</h1>\n      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n        <div>\n          <label>\n            Input 1:\n            <input\n              type=\"text\"\n              value={input1}\n              onChange={(e) => setInput1(e.target.value)}\n            />\n          </label>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <label>\n            Input 2:\n            <input\n              type=\"text\"\n              value={input2}\n              onChange={(e) => setInput2(e.target.value)}\n            />\n          </label>\n        </div>\n        <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n      </form>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\n### Step 3: Run Your Application\n\nAfter you've set up the form component, make sure your development server is running. If not, you can start it using:\n\n```bash\nnpm start\n```\n\nNavigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser, and you should see your simple form with two text boxes and a submit button.\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **State Management**: We use the `useState` hook to manage the state of the text boxes (`input1` and `input2`).\n- **Form Handling**: The `handleSubmit` function prevents the default form submission and displays the values of the text boxes using an alert.\n- **Rendering**: The form is rendered with two labeled text inputs and a submit button.\n\nThis is a basic example to get you started with React. You can further customize your application by adding styles, validation, or connecting it to a backend for more complex functionality."
