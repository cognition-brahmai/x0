My code, as shown below, generates a graph with a y-axis that ranges from 10 to 30:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nf, ax = plt.subplots(1)\nxdata = [1, 4, 8]\nydata = [10, 20, 30]\nax.plot(xdata, ydata)\nplt.show(f)\n```\n\nI am happy with the range of the x-axis but I want to change the range of the y-axis to start from 0, and adjust the ymax value to accommodate all the data. I currently use the following code to do this:\n\n```python\nax.set_ylim(0, max(ydata))\n```\n\nHowever, I am wondering if there is a way to autoscale the y-axis but have it start from 0?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this by using the `autoscale` method of the axes object while setting the y-axis lower limit to 0. This way, the y-axis will start from 0 and automatically adjust the upper limit to accommodate all the data points. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nf, ax = plt.subplots(1)\nxdata = [1, 4, 8]\nydata = [10, 20, 30]\nax.plot(xdata, ydata)\n\n# Set the lower limit of the y-axis to 0\nax.set_ylim(bottom=0)\n\n# Autoscale the y-axis to find the best upper limit\nax.autoscale(enable=True, axis='y', tight=True)\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis code sets the lower limit of the y-axis to 0 and then uses `autoscale` to automatically adjust the upper limit based on your data. The `tight=True` parameter ensures that the autoscaling fits the data tightly within the plot window."
