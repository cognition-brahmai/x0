Therefore, I don't want to rely on an external source for data in a unit test. Here's a sample of my code:\n\n```\nparams = (url, urlencode(data),) if data else (url,)\nreq = Request(*params)\nresponse = urlopen(req)\n#check headers, content-length, etc...\n#parse the response XML with lxml...\n```\n\nHow can I unit test this module?"

        "content": "To unit test a module that makes HTTP requests using `urllib2`, you can use mocking to simulate the responses. This way, you can test your code's logic without relying on actual external resources.\n\nHere's how you can do it using the `unittest` framework and the `unittest.mock` module, which provides utilities to replace parts of your system under test and make assertions about how they have been used.\n\nHere's an example of how you can mock `urlopen` to test your module:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\nfrom unittest.mock import patch, Mock\nfrom urllib.request import urlopen, Request\nfrom io import BytesIO\n\nclass TestMyModule(unittest.TestCase):\n    @patch('urllib.request.urlopen')\n    def test_my_module(self, mock_urlopen):\n        # Create a mock response object\n        mock_response = Mock()\n        mock_response.read.return_value = b'<xml>Test XML Content</xml>'\n        mock_response.headers = {\n            'Content-Length': '19',\n            'Content-Type': 'application/xml'\n        }\n        \n        # Set the mock response to be returned when urlopen is called\n        mock_urlopen.return_value = mock_response\n        \n        # Call your function or code that uses urlopen\n        url = 'http://example.com/api'\n        req = Request(url)\n        response = urlopen(req)\n        \n        # Put your assertions here\n        self.assertEqual(response.read(), b'<xml>Test XML Content</xml>')\n        self.assertEqual(response.headers['Content-Length'], '19')\n        self.assertEqual(response.headers['Content-Type'], 'application/xml')\n\n        # You can also assert that urlopen was called with the expected parameters\n        mock_urlopen.assert_called_with(req)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- We use `patch` to replace `urlopen` with a mock object.\n- We define what the mock `urlopen` should return when called by setting `mock_urlopen.return_value`.\n- We create a `mock_response` object to mimic the behavior of an actual HTTP response, including the `read` method and headers.\n- We perform the same steps your code would do to ensure it behaves correctly with the mocked response.\n- Finally, we make assertions to verify that the response was processed correctly and that `urlopen` was called with the expected parameters.\n\nThis approach allows you to test your code logic without making actual HTTP requests."
