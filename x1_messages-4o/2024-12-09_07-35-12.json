I have written some code that I believe will implement the slice functionality correctly. However, whenever I attempt a call such as `v[4]` where `v` is a vector, Python returns an error about not having enough parameters. How can I define the `__getitem__` special method in my class to handle both plain indexes and slicing?\n\nHere's the code I have so far:\n\n```python\ndef __getitem__(self, start, stop, step):\n    index = start\n    if stop == None:\n        end = start + 1\n    else:\n        end = stop\n    if step == None:\n        stride = 1\n    else:\n        stride = step\n    return self.__data[index:end:stride]\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering arises from the incorrect definition of the `__getitem__` method. In Python, the `__getitem__` method should only take two parameters: `self` and a single key. This key can either be an integer (for a single index) or a `slice` object (for slicing). \n\nHere's how you can define the `__getitem__` method to handle both cases:\n\n```python\ndef __getitem__(self, key):\n    if isinstance(key, slice):\n        # Extract the slice parameters\n        start = key.start\n        stop = key.stop\n        step = key.step\n        # Return the sliced data\n        return self.__data[start:stop:step]\n    elif isinstance(key, int):\n        # Handle the single index case\n        return self.__data[key]\n    else:\n        raise TypeError(\"Invalid argument type.\")\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the changes:\n\n1. **Single Parameter**: The `__getitem__` method now takes only one argument besides `self`, which is `key`.\n   \n2. **Check Type of Key**: Use `isinstance` to determine if `key` is a `slice` object or an integer.\n\n3. **Handle Slicing**: If `key` is a `slice`, extract `start`, `stop`, and `step` using `key.start`, `key.stop`, and `key.step`, respectively. Then, use these to slice `self.__data`.\n\n4. **Handle Single Index**: If `key` is an integer, simply return the corresponding element from `self.__data`.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Raise a `TypeError` if `key` is neither an integer nor a `slice`.\n\nThis should allow your vector class to properly handle both single index accesses like `v[4]` and slicing like `v[1:4:2]`."
