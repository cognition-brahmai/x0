The dataset is in the form of an Excel table with the following columns: Country 1, Country 2, Border Type, Border Length. \nUsing this dataset, can you determine which two adjacent countries share a water border? Specifically, which countries share a water border with India and Pakistan?"

        "content": "To determine which countries share a water border with India and Pakistan using the dataset you described, you would need to filter the dataset based on the \"Border Type\" column to identify entries that indicate a water border (e.g., entries labeled as \"Water\" or other relevant terms indicating a water border). Then, you would look for entries in the \"Country 1\" and \"Country 2\" columns that contain either \"India\" or \"Pakistan.\"\n\nHere's a general approach you could follow using Excel:\n\n1. **Apply Filters**: Enable filtering for your Excel table by selecting the entire table and clicking on the \"Filter\" option under the \"Data\" tab.\n\n2. **Filter by Border Type**: Use the filter to display only those rows where the \"Border Type\" column indicates a water border.\n\n3. **Identify India and Pakistan**: \n   - Look for rows where \"Country 1\" is India or Pakistan and note the corresponding \"Country 2\".\n   - Similarly, look for rows where \"Country 2\" is India or Pakistan and note the corresponding \"Country 1\".\n\n4. **Compile Results**: Compile a list of countries that appear alongside India and Pakistan in the filtered dataset.\n\nFor your specific query, the countries that share a water border with India include Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Maldives, and possibly others depending on the dataset's granularity. For Pakistan, the relevant country is Iran in the context of water borders.\n\nKeep in mind that the actual countries may vary based on the dataset's completeness and accuracy."
