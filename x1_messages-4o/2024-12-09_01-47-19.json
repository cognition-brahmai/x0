        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to a compatibility issue between Ansible 2.0.0.2 and Python 3. The `basestring` type was used in Python 2 to represent string types, but it was removed in Python 3, which is why you're getting a `NameError`.\n\nThere are a few ways to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Upgrade Ansible**: If possible, upgrade to a more recent version of Ansible that fully supports Python 3. Ansible 2.0.0.2 is quite old, and newer versions have better support for Python 3.\n\n    You can upgrade Ansible using pip:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install --upgrade ansible\n    ```\n\n2. **Use Python 2.7**: If upgrading Ansible is not an option, consider using Python 2.7. Ansible 2.0.0.2 is designed to work with Python 2.7, and switching to this version of Python might resolve the issue.\n\n    You can create a virtual environment using Python 2.7:\n\n    ```bash\n    virtualenv -p python2.7 myenv\n    source myenv/bin/activate\n    ```\n\n    Then, reinstall Ansible in this environment:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install ansible==2.0.0.2\n    ```\n\n3. **Modify Source Code (Not recommended for long-term use)**: As a temporary workaround, you can manually modify the Ansible source code. Locate the file `task_queue_manager.py` and replace `basestring` with `str`. However, this is not recommended for a production environment or as a long-term solution.\n\nTo summarize, upgrading Ansible to a version that supports Python 3 is the best option. If that's not possible, using Python 2.7 with Ansible 2.0.0.2 is a viable alternative."
