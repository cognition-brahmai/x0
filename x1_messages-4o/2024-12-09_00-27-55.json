You can do this by adding the following line to your `.gitignore` file:\n\n   ```\n   *.pyc\n   ```\n\n2. **Check if `.pyc` files are already tracked:**\n   If `.pyc` files were already tracked before you added them to your `.gitignore`, Git will continue tracking them. You need to untrack these files. To do this, run the following command:\n\n   ```\n   git rm --cached *.pyc\n   ```\n\n   This command removes the `.pyc` files from the staging area (index) without deleting them from your working directory.\n\n3. **Commit the changes:**\n   After you've removed the `.pyc` files from the index, commit the changes to ensure they are no longer tracked:\n\n   ```\n   git commit -m \"Remove tracked .pyc files and update .gitignore\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify the `.gitignore` is working:**\n   To verify that your `.gitignore` is working correctly, you can use:\n\n   ```\n   git check-ignore -v path/to/file.pyc\n   ```\n\n   Replace `path/to/file.pyc` with the path to a `.pyc` file in your project. This command should return the rule in your `.gitignore` that is causing the file to be ignored.\n\nBy following these steps, `.pyc` files should be untracked and ignored by Git in your repository."
