However, when I attempt to change one of the innermost values with `xs[0][0] = 5`, every first element of each sublist changes to `5`, resulting in `xs == [[5, 1, 1, 1], [5, 1, 1, 1], [5, 1, 1, 1]]`. Why is this happening?"

        "content": "The behavior you're encountering is due to how Python handles list multiplication and referencing. When you create a list of lists using the expression `xs = [[1] * 4] * 3`, you are not actually creating three independent sublists. Instead, you're creating one list (`[1, 1, 1, 1]`) and then replicating the reference to this same list three times. This means all three sublists in `xs` refer to the same single list in memory.\n\nAs a result, when you modify one of these sublists (like `xs[0][0] = 5`), all references to this list reflect the change, resulting in `xs == [[5, 1, 1, 1], [5, 1, 1, 1], [5, 1, 1, 1]]`.\n\nTo create a list of independent sublists, you can use a list comprehension:\n\n```python\nxs = [[1] * 4 for _ in range(3)]\n```\n\nThis will create a new list for each sublist, so changes to one sublist will not affect the others. With this approach, if you modify `xs[0][0] = 5`, only the first sublist will change, and the result will be:\n\n```python\nxs == [[5, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1]]\n```"
