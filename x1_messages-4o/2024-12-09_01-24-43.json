I divide the set indices into 11 bins and create custom probabilities for them. Here is the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nbin_probs = [0.5, 0.3, 0.15, 0.04, 0.0025, 0.0025, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001]\n\nX_train = list(range(2000000))\n\ntrain_probs = bin_probs * int(len(X_train) / len(bin_probs)) # extend probabilities across bin elements\ntrain_probs.extend([0.001]*(len(X_train) - len(train_probs))) # a small fix to match number of elements\ntrain_probs = train_probs/np.sum(train_probs) # normalize\nindices = np.random.choice(range(len(X_train)), replace=False, size=50000, p=train_probs)\nout_images = X_train[indices.astype(int)] # this is where I get the error\n```\n\nWhen I run this, I get a TypeError: only integer scalar arrays can be converted to a scalar index with 1D numpy indices array. This confuses me because the array of indices I created is 1-D, it's an integer, and it's scalar. I've also tried passing indices with astype(int) with no luck. What am I missing?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to attempting to index a Python list (`X_train`) with a NumPy array (`indices`). In Python, unlike NumPy arrays, lists do not support advanced indexing. You need to convert your indices into a list or use a NumPy array for `X_train`. Here's how you can fix it:\n\nOption 1: Convert `X_train` to a NumPy array:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nbin_probs = [0.5, 0.3, 0.15, 0.04, 0.0025, 0.0025, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001]\n\nX_train = np.array(range(2000000))\n\ntrain_probs = np.array(bin_probs * int(len(X_train) / len(bin_probs))) # extend probabilities across bin elements\ntrain_probs = np.append(train_probs, [0.001] * (len(X_train) - len(train_probs))) # a small fix to match number of elements\ntrain_probs = train_probs/np.sum(train_probs) # normalize\nindices = np.random.choice(range(len(X_train)), replace=False, size=50000, p=train_probs)\nout_images = X_train[indices.astype(int)]\n```\n\nOption 2: Convert `indices` to a list:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nbin_probs = [0.5, 0.3, 0.15, 0.04, 0.0025, 0.0025, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001]\n\nX_train = list(range(2000000))\n\ntrain_probs = np.array(bin_probs * int(len(X_train) / len(bin_probs))) # extend probabilities across bin elements\ntrain_probs = np.append(train_probs, [0.001] * (len(X_train) - len(train_probs))) # a small fix to match number of elements\ntrain_probs = train_probs/np.sum(train_probs) # normalize\nindices = np.random.choice(range(len(X_train)), replace=False, size=50000, p=train_probs)\nout_images = [X_train[i] for i in indices] # convert indices to list for indexing\n```\n\nEither of these options should resolve the TypeError you're encountering."
