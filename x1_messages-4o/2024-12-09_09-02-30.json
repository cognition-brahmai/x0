        "content": "Certainly! Below is an example of SQL code to create a table for storing contact information. This example assumes you want to store basic contact details such as a unique ID, name, email, phone number, and address:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE Contacts (\n    ContactID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n    LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,\n    PhoneNumber VARCHAR(15),\n    Address VARCHAR(255),\n    City VARCHAR(50),\n    State VARCHAR(50),\n    ZipCode VARCHAR(10),\n    Country VARCHAR(50)\n);\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **ContactID**: An integer field that serves as a unique identifier for each contact. It is set to auto-increment, so it will automatically increase with each new entry.\n- **FirstName** and **LastName**: These fields store the first and last names of the contact, respectively. They are required (`NOT NULL`).\n- **Email**: A field to store the contact's email address, which must be unique.\n- **PhoneNumber**: A field to store the contact's phone number.\n- **Address**, **City**, **State**, **ZipCode**, and **Country**: Fields to store the contact's physical address details.\n\nThis is a basic structure, and you can adjust the fields and data types according to your specific requirements."
