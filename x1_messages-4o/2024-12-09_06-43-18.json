I want to start familiarizing myself with Python 3.x syntax as much as possible while still using Python 2.7. I know that running 'python -3' will warn about Python 3.x incompatibilities that 2to3 cannot trivially fix, but I'm more interested in writing Python 2.7 code that is as compatible as possible with Python 3.x. I understand that I should be using the following import statements:\n\n```\nfrom __future__ import print_function\nfrom __future__ import unicode_literals\nfrom __future__ import division\nfrom __future__ import absolute_import\n```\n\nThese are required in Python 3.0 but not in Python 2.7. What other practices should I adopt to write Python 2.7 code that will be as compatible as possible with Python 3.x?"

        "content": "To write Python 2.7 code that is as compatible as possible with Python 3.x, you can adopt the following practices in addition to the `__future__` imports you've mentioned:\n\n1. **Use `six` Library**: The `six` library provides utilities for writing code that is compatible with both Python 2 and 3. It abstracts differences like string handling, metaclasses, iterators, and more.\n\n   ```sh\n   pip install six\n   ```\n\n   Example usage:\n   ```python\n   import six\n\n   if six.PY2:\n       # Python 2 specific code\n   elif six.PY3:\n       # Python 3 specific code\n   ```\n\n2. **Use `print` as a Function**: Always use `print()` with parentheses.\n\n   ```python\n   print(\"Hello, World!\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Use `new-style` Classes**: Always inherit from `object` for all classes.\n\n   ```python\n   class MyClass(object):\n       pass\n   ```\n\n4. **Use `iteritems` and `itervalues` from `six`**: When iterating over dictionaries, use `six.iteritems()` and `six.itervalues()` to handle dictionary items and values.\n\n   ```python\n   for key, value in six.iteritems(my_dict):\n       pass\n   ```\n\n5. **Use `range` instead of `xrange`**: In Python 3, `xrange` is not available, and `range` behaves like `xrange` in Python 2.\n\n   ```python\n   for i in range(10):\n       pass\n   ```\n\n6. **Use `//` for Floor Division**: Use the `//` operator for integer division to get consistent behavior.\n\n   ```python\n   result = 5 // 2  # This will be 2 in both Python 2 and 3\n   ```\n\n7. **Use `bytes` and `str` Correctly**: In Python 3, `str` is unicode, and `bytes` is a separate type. Use `b\"string\"` for byte strings.\n\n   ```python\n   byte_string = b\"hello\"\n   unicode_string = u\"hello\"\n   ```\n\n8. **Use `__future__` for `unicode_literals`**: This is already covered by your imports, but always handle string literals as unicode.\n\n9. **Avoid `cmp` Function**: Use key functions in sorting instead of `cmp`.\n\n   ```python\n   sorted_items = sorted(items, key=lambda x: x.some_attribute)\n   ```\n\n10. **Handle Exception Syntax**: Use `as` for exception handling.\n\n    ```python\n    try:\n        pass\n    except Exception as e:\n        pass\n    ```\n\n11. **Use `io` Module for File Operations**: Use `io.open()` for file operations to ensure correct handling of file encoding.\n\n    ```python\n    import io\n\n    with io.open('file.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n        content = f.read()\n    ```\n\n12. **Explicit `relative imports`**: Use explicit relative imports for intra-package imports to avoid ambiguity.\n\n    ```python\n    from . import sibling_module\n    ```\n\nBy following these practices, you can write Python 2.7 code that is more compatible with Python 3.x, easing the eventual transition."
