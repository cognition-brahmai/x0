        "content": "How can I prevent a class from direct instantiation in Python? I have a superclass with a method that calls other methods that are only defined in its subclasses. When I create an instance of my superclass and call its method, it cannot find the method and raises an AttributeError. For instance, given the following code:\n\n```python\nclass SuperClass(object):\n\n  def method_one(self):\n    value = self.subclass_method()\n    print value\n\n\nclass SubClassOne(SuperClass):\n\n  def subclass_method(self):\n    return 'subclass 1'\n\n\nclass SubClassTwo(SuperClass):\n\n  def subclass_method(self):\n    return 'nubclass 2'\n\n\ns1 = SubClassOne()\ns1.method_one()\n\ns2 = SubClassTwo()\ns2.method_one()\n\nc = SuperClass()\nc.method_one()\n```\nIt gives me this output:\n```\nsubclass 1\nnubclass 2\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"abst.py\", line 28, in &lt;module&gt;\n    c.method_one()\n  File \"abst.py\", line 4, in method_one\n    value = self.subclass_method()\nAttributeError: 'SuperClass' object has no attribute 'subclass_method'\n```\nI am considering changing the __init__ of the superclass and verifying the type of the object when a new instance is created. If the object belongs to the superclass, it will raise an error. However, I'm not sure if this is the best way to handle this in Python. Can you provide any recommendations?"

        "content": "To prevent direct instantiation of a superclass in Python, you can make the class abstract. This is a common practice to ensure that the superclass is only used as a base class and cannot be instantiated directly. The `abc` module in Python provides a convenient way to achieve this through the use of abstract base classes (ABCs).\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use the `abc` module and make `SuperClass` an abstract class:\n\n```python\nfrom abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n\nclass SuperClass(ABC):\n\n    @abstractmethod\n    def subclass_method(self):\n        pass\n\n    def method_one(self):\n        value = self.subclass_method()\n        print(value)\n\n\nclass SubClassOne(SuperClass):\n\n    def subclass_method(self):\n        return 'subclass 1'\n\n\nclass SubClassTwo(SuperClass):\n\n    def subclass_method(self):\n        return 'subclass 2'\n\n\ns1 = SubClassOne()\ns1.method_one()\n\ns2 = SubClassTwo()\ns2.method_one()\n\n# This will now raise a TypeError because SuperClass cannot be instantiated directly\ntry:\n    c = SuperClass()\n    c.method_one()\nexcept TypeError as e:\n    print(e)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Inherit from `ABC`:** Make `SuperClass` inherit from `abc.ABC` to designate it as an abstract base class.\n\n2. **Use `@abstractmethod`:** Mark `subclass_method` with the `@abstractmethod` decorator. This enforces that any non-abstract subclass must implement this method.\n\n3. **Attempting to Instantiate:** Trying to instantiate `SuperClass` will now result in a `TypeError`, as it contains abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses.\n\nBy doing this, you ensure that `SuperClass` can only be used as a base class, and any attempt to instantiate it directly will raise an error, preventing the `AttributeError` you encountered."
