My prediction matrix has the shape [n_samples,n_classes] and my ground truth vector has the shape [n_samples]. I named them 'np_pred' and 'np_label' respectively. I am looking to get a set of AUC scores, one for each class. I tried to use the 'average' parameter option 'None' and set the 'multi_class' parameter to 'ovr', but when I try to run 'roc_auc_score(y_score=np_pred, y_true=np_label, multi_class=\"ovr\",average=None)', I receive a ValueError: 'average must be one of ('macro', 'weighted') for multiclass problems'. This error seems to suggest that I should be able to execute a multiclass with a 'None' average in a 'One vs Rest' case but the if statements in the source code do not allow such a combination. Have I made a mistake? Should I simulate a multilabel case to get different AUCs for different classes, or should I write my own function that cycles through different classes and outputs the AUCs?"

        "content": "It looks like you're encountering a common issue when trying to compute AUC scores for each class in a multiclass classification problem using `roc_auc_score` from `sklearn`. The `roc_auc_score` function can be a bit tricky to use in this context due to its handling of the `average` parameter.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to help you calculate the AUC for each class individually:\n\n1. **Binarize the Ground Truth Labels**: Convert the `np_label` vector into a binary format for each class. This means creating a binary label vector for each class where the entries are 1 if the sample belongs to that class and 0 otherwise.\n\n2. **Compute the AUC for Each Class**: Use a loop to iterate over each class and compute the AUC score using the binarized labels and the corresponding column in `np_pred`.\n\nHere's some sample code to illustrate this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import label_binarize\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Assuming np_pred is your prediction matrix and np_label is your ground truth vector.\n# Let's say you have 3 classes, so np_label values are in the range [0, 2].\n\n# Binarize the ground truth labels\nn_classes = np_pred.shape[1]\nnp_label_binarized = label_binarize(np_label, classes=range(n_classes))\n\n# Calculate AUC for each class\nauc_scores = []\nfor i in range(n_classes):\n    auc = roc_auc_score(np_label_binarized[:, i], np_pred[:, i])\n    auc_scores.append(auc)\n\nprint(\"AUC scores for each class:\", auc_scores)\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- `label_binarize` is used to convert the `np_label` vector into a binary matrix where each column corresponds to a class and each row represents whether the sample belongs to that class or not.\n- Then, for each class, you compute the AUC using the binarized labels (`np_label_binarized[:, i]`) and the predicted probabilities for that class (`np_pred[:, i]`).\n\nThis approach should give you the AUC scores for each class separately.
