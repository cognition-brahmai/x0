My initial code is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ntest3 = pd.Series([1,2,3], index = ['a','b','c'])\ntest3 = test3.reindex(index = ['f','g','z'])\n```\n\nIn the beginning, `test3` has an index of 'a', 'b', 'c' and the corresponding values 1,2,3. However, when I reindex `test3`, it seems that my original values of 1, 2, 3 are lost. Can anyone explain why this is happening and how can I achieve my desired output where the reindexed series has indices 'f', 'g', 'z' and retains the original values 1, 2, 3 respectively?"

        "content": "When you reindex a pandas Series, you are essentially aligning the Series to a new set of indices. If the new indices don't match any of the existing indices, the resulting Series will have `NaN` values for those positions because there is no data available for those indices.\n\nIn your case, you are reindexing `test3` with the indices `['f', 'g', 'z']`, which don't match any of the original indices `['a', 'b', 'c']`. That's why the values 1, 2, and 3 are lost, and you get `NaN` for each of the new indices.\n\nIf you want to assign the values 1, 2, and 3 to the indices `['f', 'g', 'z']`, you can create a new Series with these indices and values directly. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create a new Series with the desired indices and values\ntest3 = pd.Series([1, 2, 3], index=['f', 'g', 'z'])\n\nprint(test3)\n```\n\nThis will give you a Series with the indices 'f', 'g', 'z' and the corresponding values 1, 2, and 3."
