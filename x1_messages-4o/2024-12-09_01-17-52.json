I have already installed several versions of CUDA toolkit, but my system only recognizes the latest version installed. I have added the path to an environment variable and included the CUDNN copied file in the environment. However, I need to use CUDA 9.0 for my current code, but the default setting is CUDA 11.0. How can I switch between these versions easily?"

        "content": "Managing multiple CUDA versions on Windows can be a bit tricky, but it's definitely doable. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you switch between different CUDA versions for your project:\n\n1. **Install Multiple CUDA Versions**: Ensure you have the required CUDA versions installed. You can install multiple CUDA versions side by side.\n\n2. **Environment Variables**: Each CUDA installation comes with its own `bin`, `lib`, and `include` directories. You'll need to manipulate the `PATH`, `CUDA_PATH`, and other related environment variables to switch between versions.\n\n3. **Switching CUDA Versions**: You can create batch scripts to switch between different CUDA versions by updating the environment variables. Here\u2019s a sample script you can use to switch to CUDA 9.0:\n\n   ```batch\n   @echo off\n   set CUDA_PATH=C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v9.0\n   set PATH=%CUDA_PATH%\\bin;%CUDA_PATH%\\libnvvp;%PATH%\n   set LIB=%CUDA_PATH%\\lib;%LIB%\n   set INCLUDE=%CUDA_PATH%\\include;%INCLUDE%\n   echo Switched to CUDA 9.0\n   ```\n\n   You can create a similar script for CUDA 11.0 or any other version you have installed.\n\n4. **CUDA CUDNN Compatibility**: Make sure the CUDNN version you are using is compatible with the CUDA version you are switching to. You might need to switch CUDNN files as well when you switch CUDA versions.\n\n5. **Project Settings**: If you are using an IDE like Visual Studio, ensure that your project settings point to the correct CUDA toolkit version. This includes setting the correct paths for CUDA and CUDNN in the project properties.\n\n6. **Testing**: After switching versions, test your setup by compiling a simple program to ensure that the correct CUDA version is being used.\n\n7. **Using Virtual Environments**: If you are working with Python, consider using virtual environments to manage different dependencies for different projects. Tools like `conda` can help manage different CUDA versions for different environments.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to switch between different CUDA versions on your Windows machine easily."
