Here is an example of the issue I'm facing:\n\n```python\n>>> key = 'foo'\n>>> a={}\n>>> b={key:'bar'}\n>>> b.get(key, a[key])\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<pyshell#5>\", line 1, in <module>\n    b.get(key, a[key])\nKeyError: 'foo'\n```\n\nIn the above code, the `KeyError` exception is raised when trying to evaluate `a[key]` which is passed as the default argument in `b.get()`, even though the key 'foo' is present in dictionary `b`."

        "content": "The behavior you are encountering is due to the way function arguments are evaluated in Python. In Python, all arguments to a function are evaluated before the function is called. This includes default arguments, even if they are not ultimately used by the function.\n\nIn the case of the `dict.get()` method, when you call `b.get(key, a[key])`, both `key` and `a[key]` are evaluated before `get()` is executed. Since `a[key]` tries to access a key that does not exist in dictionary `a`, a `KeyError` is raised.\n\nTo avoid this issue, you can provide a default value directly that doesn't require additional evaluation or computation. For example, if you want to return `None` or some other constant value when the key is not found, you can do this:\n\n```python\nresult = b.get(key, None)\n```\n\nIf you need to perform some computation or access another dictionary only if the key is not present, you can use a conditional expression or a try-except block instead:\n\n```python\nresult = b[key] if key in b else a.get(key)\n```\n\nOr using try-except:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    result = b[key]\nexcept KeyError:\n    result = a.get(key)\n```\n\nThese approaches ensure that the default value is only accessed if necessary, avoiding the premature evaluation problem."
