I'm aware that Python doesn't have 'real' private/protected methods. Here is the code I'm working with:\n\n```python\nclass Parent(object):\n    def _protected(self):\n        pass\n\n    def __private(self):\n        pass\n\nclass Child(Parent):\n    def foo(self):\n        self._protected()   # This works\n\n    def bar(self):\n        self.__private()    # This doesn't work, I get a AttributeError:\n                            # 'Child' object has no attribute '_Child__private'\n```\n\nDoes this behavior imply that 'protected' methods will be inherited but 'private' methods won't? Or am I missing something?"

        "content": "In Python, the concepts of \"private\" and \"protected\" methods are implemented differently compared to languages like Java or C++. Here's a breakdown of what's happening in your code:\n\n1. **Protected Methods**:\n   - In Python, a single underscore (`_`) prefix suggests that a method or attribute is intended for internal use. It's a convention and doesn't enforce any real restrictions on access. Thus, `_protected()` is accessible in subclasses, as shown in your `Child` class where `self._protected()` works just fine.\n\n2. **Private Methods**:\n   - A double underscore (`__`) prefix is Python's way of name mangling to create a kind of private method. When you define `__private` in the `Parent` class, Python internally changes its name to `_Parent__private`. This means it's not directly accessible from outside the class or from derived classes using its original name.\n   - When you try to call `self.__private()` in the `Child` class, Python looks for `_Child__private`, which doesn't exist, hence the `AttributeError`.\n\nTo access a \"private\" method from a derived class, you'd need to use the mangled name like `_Parent__private()`, although this is generally discouraged as it breaks encapsulation principles.\n\nIn summary:\n- **Protected methods** (with `_`) are accessible in subclasses and are meant to be a convention for internal use.\n- **Private methods** (with `__`) use name mangling to prevent accidental access and are not directly accessible from subclasses.\n\nYour understanding is correct that \"protected\" methods are inherited in a way that allows them to be accessed by subclasses, while \"private\" methods are not intended to be accessed outside their own class, hence they appear not to be inherited in the usual sense."
