        "content": "Sending a `multipart/form-data` request using the `requests` library in Python is quite straightforward. This is commonly used when you need to send both files and form data in the same request. Below is an example of how you can accomplish this:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# URL to which the request will be sent\nurl = 'https://example.com/upload'\n\n# Form data\nform_data = {\n    'key1': 'value1',\n    'key2': 'value2',\n    # Add more key-value pairs as needed\n}\n\n# Files to be sent\nfiles = {\n    'file1': ('filename1.txt', open('filename1.txt', 'rb'), 'text/plain'),\n    'file2': ('filename2.jpg', open('filename2.jpg', 'rb'), 'image/jpeg'),\n    # Add more files as needed\n}\n\n# Send the POST request\nresponse = requests.post(url, data=form_data, files=files)\n\n# Check the response\nprint(response.status_code)\nprint(response.text)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **URL**: Replace `'https://example.com/upload'` with the actual URL where you want to send the request.\n\n2. **Form Data**: The `form_data` dictionary contains key-value pairs of the form data you want to send.\n\n3. **Files**: The `files` dictionary specifies the files to be uploaded. Each entry consists of:\n   - The key as the form field name.\n   - A tuple containing:\n     - The file name as it should appear on the server.\n     - The file object opened in binary read mode.\n     - The MIME type of the file.\n\n4. **Sending Request**: The `requests.post()` method is used to send the request, with `data` parameter for form data and `files` parameter for files.\n\n5. **Response**: After sending the request, you can check the response status code and content to verify that the request was successful.\n\nMake sure to handle the file opening and closing appropriately, or use a context manager (`with` statement) to ensure files are properly closed after usage."
