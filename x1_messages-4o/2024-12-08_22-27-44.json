You have 4 containers of different sizes and want to fit everything into them as efficiently as possible.\nYour goal is to determine the maximum total importance level you can pack into the containers while ensuring that each container is not overfilled. \nFor example, if you have 5 items with importance levels of 8, 5, 6, 7, and 9 and sizes of 2, 3, 1, 4, and 5 respectively, you could pack them into the containers with sizes of 8, 7, 6, and 4 in the following manner:\nContainer 1: item 5 (size 5, importance level 9)\nContainer 2: items 1 and 4 (sizes 2+4 = 6, importance levels 8+7 = 15)\nContainer 3: item 2 (size 3, importance level 5)\nContainer 4: item 3 (size 1, importance level 6)\nIn this scenario, the maximum total importance level is 30.\nYour task is to write a C++ program that takes in the number of items, their sizes, and their importance levels as inputs, and outputs the maximum total importance level that can be packed into the containers using a priority queue. Good luck!"

        "content": "Sure! Here is a C++ program that implements a solution to this problem using a priority queue. The approach is similar to solving a knapsack problem, where we aim to maximize the total importance level while considering the size constraints of the containers.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <queue>\n#include <algorithm>\n\nstruct Item {\n    int size;\n    int importance;\n};\n\nbool compareItems(Item a, Item b) {\n    return a.importance > b.importance;\n}\n\nint maximizeImportance(std::vector<Item>& items, std::vector<int>& containerSizes) {\n    // Sort items based on importance in descending order\n    std::sort(items.begin(), items.end(), compareItems);\n\n    // Sort containers based on their sizes in ascending order\n    std::sort(containerSizes.begin(), containerSizes.end());\n\n    int totalImportance = 0;\n    std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> pq;\n\n    for (auto& container : containerSizes) {\n        pq.push(container);\n    }\n\n    for (auto& item : items) {\n        if (!pq.empty()) {\n            int smallestContainer = pq.top();\n\n            if (item.size <= smallestContainer) {\n                totalImportance += item.importance;\n                pq.pop();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    return totalImportance;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int numItems;\n    std::cout << \"Enter the number of items: \";\n    std::cin >> numItems;\n\n    std::vector<Item> items(numItems);\n    std::cout << \"Enter the size and importance level of each item:\" << std::endl;\n    for (int i = 0; i < numItems; ++i) {\n        std::cin >> items[i].size >> items[i].importance;\n    }\n\n    int numContainers = 4;\n    std::vector<int> containerSizes(numContainers);\n    std::cout << \"Enter the sizes of the containers:\" << std::endl;\n    for (int i = 0; i < numContainers; ++i) {\n        std::cin >> containerSizes[i];\n    }\n\n    int maxImportance = maximizeImportance(items, containerSizes);\n    std::cout << \"The maximum total importance level that can be packed is: \" << maxImportance << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Data Structures**: We use a vector to store items, each containing `size` and `importance`. Another vector stores the container sizes.\n   \n2. **Sorting**: \n   - Items are sorted in descending order based on their importance. This ensures we try to pack the most important items first.\n   - Containers are sorted in ascending order by size to fit items in the smallest available container that can hold them.\n\n3. **Priority Queue**: A priority queue (`std::priority_queue`) is used to manage available containers, always accessing the smallest container that can accommodate an item.\n\n4. **Greedy Approach**: We iterate over each item, check the smallest container that can fit it, and add its importance to the total if it fits.\n\n5. **Output**: Finally, the program outputs the maximum total importance level that can be packed into the containers.\n\nCompile and run this program, inputting the number of items, their sizes, and importance levels, as well as the container sizes, to find the optimal packing."
