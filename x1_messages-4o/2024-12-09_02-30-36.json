I created a blue HSV color boundary and thresholded the HSV image using the command `mask_img = cv2.inRange(hsv, lower_blue, upper_blue)`. After this, I used `bitwise_and` on the input image and the thresholded image with the command `res = cv2.bitwise_and(img, img, mask = mask_img)`. In this command, `img` is the input image. I do not understand why there are three arguments used in `bitwise_and` and what each argument means. Why is the same image used for src1 and src2? Also, what is the use of the `mask` keyword in this context?"

        "content": "The `cv2.bitwise_and` function in OpenCV is used to perform a bitwise AND operation between two arrays (images) of the same size. Let's break down the arguments used in the command:\n\n1. **src1 and src2**: These are the first and second input arrays. In your command, both `src1` and `src2` are set to `img`, which means that the bitwise AND operation is being performed between the image and itself. This might seem redundant at first, but it makes sense when you consider the use of the `mask`.\n\n2. **mask**: This is an optional argument that allows you to specify a binary mask, which determines where the operation should be applied. In this context, the mask is `mask_img`, which is the result of your thresholding operation (using `cv2.inRange`). This mask defines the region of interest where the bitwise AND operation will be applied.\n\nWhen you use a mask, the bitwise operation is only applied to the pixels where the mask is non-zero (in this case, the pixels that fall within the specified blue boundary). Pixels outside this boundary are set to zero in the result image.\n\nSo, the `bitwise_and` operation in your code can be understood as follows: It takes the input image (`img`) and produces a new image (`res`) where only the areas of `img` that correspond to the blue color (as defined by `mask_img`) are retained. The rest of the image is set to black (zero pixel values).\n\nIn summary:\n- `src1` and `src2` being the same (`img`) means that you are not altering the pixel values, just filtering them.\n- The `mask` is used to specify which parts of the image to keep (the blue areas) and which to discard (set to zero)."
