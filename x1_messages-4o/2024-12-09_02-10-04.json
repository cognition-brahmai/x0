I followed a tutorial for uploading images and it worked fine, but the problem arises when I try to display the images in the template. I learned that I should add `+ static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)` to the end of my `urls.py` file. However, after doing this, I get an \"ImproperlyConfigured at / Empty static prefix not permitted\" error. I have `MEDIA_URL` and `MEDIA_ROOT` in my `settings.py` file and neither are empty. The relevant parts of my `urls.py` file looks like this:\n\n```\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.conf.urls.static import static\nimport notifications\nadmin.autodiscover()\n\nurlpatterns = patterns('',\n    ....urls......\n\n) + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)\n```\n\nAnd my `settings.py` file contains:\n\n```\nBASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))\n\nMEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')\n\n# URL that handles the media served from MEDIA_ROOT. Make sure to use a\n# trailing slash.\n# Examples: \"http://example.com/media/\", \"http://media.example.com/\"\nMEDIA_URL = '/media/'\n```\n\nWhy am I getting this error and how can I fix it?"

        "content": "The \"ImproperlyConfigured at / Empty static prefix not permitted\" error you're encountering is typically related to Django's configuration for serving static files and media files. When deploying on Heroku, it's important to remember that Heroku doesn\u2019t handle static and media files in the same way as your local development environment. Here's a step-by-step guide to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure MEDIA_URL and MEDIA_ROOT are Correct:**\n   - Your `MEDIA_URL` and `MEDIA_ROOT` seem correctly set in your `settings.py` file. Make sure these settings are not overridden elsewhere in your settings.\n\n2. **Check STATIC_URL and STATIC_ROOT:**\n   - Ensure you have defined `STATIC_URL` and `STATIC_ROOT` properly in your `settings.py`. Even though this error is related to media files, sometimes static files settings can interfere if they're not correctly configured.\n\n    ```python\n    STATIC_URL = '/static/'\n    STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')\n    ```\n\n3. **Serving Media Files in Production:**\n   - In production (like on Heroku), Django is not supposed to serve media files. Instead, you should use a cloud storage service (like Amazon S3) or a CDN to serve these files.\n   - For local development, the configuration you have should work, but in production, you need a different approach.\n\n4. **Use Whitenoise for Static Files:**\n   - Although Whitenoise is typically used for static files, ensuring your static files are correctly handled can sometimes resolve related media issues. Make sure you have Whitenoise configured:\n\n    ```python\n    MIDDLEWARE = [\n        'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',\n        # ... other middleware ...\n    ]\n    ```\n\n5. **Check for Trailing Slashes:**\n   - Ensure your `MEDIA_URL` has a trailing slash (`/`), which it does, but double-check in case there's a typo elsewhere.\n\n6. **Debugging:**\n   - If you're still facing issues, try running `python manage.py collectstatic` and see if there are any errors or warnings that could provide more context.\n\n7. **Use a Suitable Storage Backend:**\n   - For deployment, you will need to use a third-party storage solution like Amazon S3. You can use `django-storages` package to configure this.\n\n8. **Heroku Logs:**\n   - Check your Heroku logs using `heroku logs --tail` to see if there are additional error messages that can provide more insight.\n\nBy setting up a proper storage backend for media files and ensuring your static files are correctly handled, you should be able to resolve the error and have your images displayed correctly."
