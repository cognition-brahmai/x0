I have already checked the description of the operator module in Python's documentation, but I found it to be lacking. For instance, it does not include operators that cannot be overloaded, misses the 'r' operators, or provide sensible defaults. Are there any references where these can be found? Writing these operators is good practice, but I still think it belongs in a good reference."

        "content": "For a comprehensive guide to operator overloading in Python, you're right that the official documentation can sometimes feel lacking in depth. However, there are several resources that provide more detailed explanations and examples. Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **Books:**\n   - **\"Fluent Python\" by Luciano Ramalho**: This book is highly regarded for its deep dive into Python's advanced features, including operator overloading. It explains the use of special methods and provides practical examples.\n   - **\"Python Cookbook\" by David Beazley and Brian K. Jones**: This book offers practical solutions to many Python problems, including operator overloading, with clear examples.\n\n2. **Online Resources:**\n   - **Real Python**: They have a detailed article on operator overloading, which covers the basics and provides examples (realpython.com/operator-overloading/).\n   - **GeeksforGeeks**: Offers a straightforward guide with examples on operator overloading in Python (geeksforgeeks.org/operator-overloading-in-python/).\n   - **Stack Overflow**: It's not a formal guide, but many questions and answers on this topic delve into specifics that might be helpful for understanding nuances.\n\n3. **Blogs and Tutorials:**\n   - **Towards Data Science on Medium**: Often has articles about Python's advanced features, including operator overloading, written by various authors.\n   - **Corey Schafer's YouTube Channel**: He has a series on Python that includes operator overloading, with clear explanations and demonstrations.\n\n4. **GitHub Repositories**:\n   - Searching GitHub for projects or repositories focused on Python's advanced features can sometimes yield practical examples of operator overloading in real-world applications.\n\n5. **Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)**:\n   - Reviewing PEPs related to Python's data model can give you insights into the design philosophy behind operator overloading.\n\nWhile these resources should cover a broad range of topics related to operator overloading, they also provide context and examples that can help you understand the \"why\" and \"how\" behind using these features effectively in your Python code."
