The code I am using seems to work fine for most images, but I have discovered that some images (particularly PNGs if that's relevant) are raising an error. The error comes from the PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngStream instance and says that \"NoneType\" object has no attribute 'read'. The error doesn't occur when I don't use the `copy()` function on the image. I am looking for a better solution rather than having to open and crop the image for every thumbnail. Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nimage = Image.open(path)\nimage = image.crop((left, upper, right, lower))\nfor size in sizes:\n  temp = copy.copy(image)\n  temp.thumbnail((size, height), Image.ANTIALIAS)\n  temp.save('%s%s%s.%s' % (path, name, size, format), quality=95)\n```\n\nAnd the error I am receiving is:\n\n```python\n/usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/PIL/PngImagePlugin.py in read(self=<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngStream instance>)\nline: s = self.fp.read(8)\n<type 'exceptions.AttributeError'>: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'read' \n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with the `NoneType` object has no attribute 'read' typically indicates a problem with the underlying file object that the image is being processed from. Here are a few suggestions to help you address this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure the Image is Loaded Properly**:\n   Check if the image is loaded properly and not corrupted. You can add a try-except block to catch any exceptions while opening the image.\n\n2. **Use `copy.deepcopy`**:\n   Instead of `copy.copy`, try using `copy.deepcopy`. This can ensure that you are creating a complete and independent copy of the image object.\n\n3. **Use `image.copy()` Method**:\n   Use PIL's built-in `copy()` method for creating a copy of the image, which might be more reliable than `copy.copy`.\n\n4. **Check the Image Mode**:\n   Ensure that the image is in a mode that is appropriate for the operations you are performing. Convert it to RGB mode if necessary.\n\n5. **Close Files Properly**:\n   Ensure that files are being closed properly after processing. Use context managers (`with` statement) to handle file operations.\n\nHere's a revised version of your code with these suggestions:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport os\n\ndef create_thumbnails(path, left, upper, right, lower, sizes, name, format):\n    try:\n        with Image.open(path) as image:\n            image = image.crop((left, upper, right, lower))\n            for size in sizes:\n                temp = image.copy()\n                temp.thumbnail((size, size), Image.ANTIALIAS)\n                temp.save(f'{os.path.splitext(path)[0]}_{name}_{size}.{format}', quality=95)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n# Example usage\ncreate_thumbnails('path/to/image.png', 0, 0, 100, 100, [50, 75, 100], 'thumbnail', 'png')\n```\n\n**Additional Tips**:\n- Ensure you have the latest version of the Pillow library, as bugs and issues are often fixed in newer releases. You can update it using `pip install --upgrade Pillow`.\n- Ensure that the path, name, and format variables are correctly defined and that the path to save the thumbnails is valid.\n- If the problem persists with specific PNG files, try converting them to another format temporarily to see if the issue is related to the PNG format itself.\n\nThese changes should help you handle the issue with PNG files raising an error."
