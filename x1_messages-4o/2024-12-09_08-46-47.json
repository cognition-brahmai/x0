        "content": "To create a class in C# that can store customer details such as name, age, and address, you can define a class with properties for each of these attributes. Below is an example of how you can implement such a class:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nnamespace CustomerDetailsApp\n{\n    public class Customer\n    {\n        // Property for storing the customer's name\n        public string Name { get; set; }\n\n        // Property for storing the customer's age\n        public int Age { get; set; }\n\n        // Property for storing the customer's address\n        public string Address { get; set; }\n\n        // Constructor to initialize a new customer\n        public Customer(string name, int age, string address)\n        {\n            Name = name;\n            Age = age;\n            Address = address;\n        }\n\n        // Method to display customer details\n        public void DisplayCustomerDetails()\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Customer Details:\");\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Name: {Name}\");\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Age: {Age}\");\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Address: {Address}\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            // Create a new Customer object\n            Customer customer = new Customer(\"John Doe\", 30, \"123 Main St, Anytown, USA\");\n\n            // Display the customer's details\n            customer.DisplayCustomerDetails();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Properties**: The `Customer` class has three properties: `Name`, `Age`, and `Address`, which are used to store the respective details of a customer.\n- **Constructor**: The constructor `Customer(string name, int age, string address)` initializes a new instance of the `Customer` class with the provided values.\n- **Display Method**: The `DisplayCustomerDetails` method is a simple method to print the customer's details to the console.\n- **Main Method**: In the `Main` method, an instance of the `Customer` class is created and its details are displayed using the `DisplayCustomerDetails` method.\n\nThis code provides a basic structure for managing customer details in a C# application. You can expand this class by adding more properties or methods as needed."
