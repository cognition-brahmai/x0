        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to an issue with the `typing` module and its interaction with the `abc` module in Python. This problem has been observed in some older versions of Python and related libraries. Here's how you can potentially fix it:\n\n### Steps to Resolve the Issue:\n\n1. **Upgrade Python**: First, consider upgrading your Python version if possible. Python 3.7.2 is quite old, and upgrading to a newer version might resolve compatibility issues.\n\n2. **Upgrade Jupyter and Dependencies**: Make sure you have the latest versions of Jupyter and its dependencies. You can upgrade them using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade jupyter notebook\n   ```\n\n3. **Upgrade Tornado**: Since the stack trace mentions the `tornado` module, ensure that you have an updated version of Tornado, as some issues might have been fixed in newer releases:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade tornado\n   ```\n\n4. **Check the `typing` Module**: Ensure that the `typing` module is not manually installed in your site-packages, as it is part of the Python standard library for Python 3.5 and above. If you find a `typing` package in your `site-packages`, it might be worth removing it and relying on the standard library version.\n\n5. **Reinstall Dependencies**: Sometimes, a clean reinstall of the Jupyter and its dependencies can help:\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall jupyter notebook tornado\n   pip install jupyter\n   ```\n\n6. **Check for Compatibility Issues**: If you're using a virtual environment, make sure all packages within it are compatible with each other. It might be worth creating a new virtual environment and installing Jupyter there to see if the issue persists.\n\n7. **Alternative Solutions**: If none of the above steps work, consider using a Conda environment, which can manage dependencies more effectively:\n   ```bash\n   conda create -n jupyter_env python=3.7\n   conda activate jupyter_env\n   conda install jupyter\n   ```\n\nAfter performing these steps, try launching Jupyter Notebook again to see if the issue has been resolved. If you continue to face problems, it might be helpful to check forums or the GitHub issues page for Jupyter and Tornado for similar issues and solutions."
