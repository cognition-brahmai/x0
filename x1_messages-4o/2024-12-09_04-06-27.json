For instance, if I have an array `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, I would like to retrieve `b = [1, 2, 6, 7]` by taking two values (m = 2) every five elements (n = 5). Is it possible to accomplish this by using array slicing? I've used a nested list comprehension method as follows:\n\n```python\nb = [k for j in [a[i:i+2] for i in range(0,len(a),5)] for k in j]\n```\nBut I'm curious if there's a way to do this using only indices."

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this using array slicing with indices. The idea is to iterate over the array in steps of `n` and take `m` elements at each step. Here's how you can do it using a loop and slicing:\n\n```python\na = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nm = 2\nn = 5\nb = []\n\nfor i in range(0, len(a), n):\n    b.extend(a[i:i+m])\n\nprint(b)\n```\n\nThis code loops over the array `a` with a step size of `n` (5 in this case) and collects `m` (2) elements at each step using slicing. The `extend` method is used to add these elements to the list `b`.\n\nThis approach is pretty straightforward and uses slicing effectively without needing a nested list comprehension."
