        "content": "To accomplish this task in C++, you'll need to use a JSON parsing library like `nlohmann/json`, which is a popular single-header library for working with JSON in C++. Below is a C++ script that reads a JSON file named \"numbers.json\", calculates the sum of the numbers in the list, and displays the result.\n\nFirst, ensure you have the `nlohmann/json` library. You can download it from [GitHub](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) or install it via a package manager if you are using one that supports it.\n\nHere's the C++ code:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <nlohmann/json.hpp> // Include the JSON library\n\nusing json = nlohmann::json;\n\nint main() {\n    std::ifstream file(\"numbers.json\");\n    \n    // Check if the file is open\n    if (!file.is_open()) {\n        std::cerr << \"Error: Could not open the file 'numbers.json'.\" << std::endl;\n        return 1;\n    }\n    \n    json jsonData;\n    try {\n        file >> jsonData; // Parse the JSON file\n    } catch (const json::parse_error& e) {\n        std::cerr << \"Error: Failed to parse the JSON data. \" << e.what() << std::endl;\n        return 1;\n    }\n    \n    // Check if the \"numbers\" key is present\n    if (!jsonData.contains(\"numbers\") || !jsonData[\"numbers\"].is_array()) {\n        std::cerr << \"Error: The 'numbers' key is missing or is not an array.\" << std::endl;\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    std::vector<int> numbers = jsonData[\"numbers\"];\n    int sum = 0;\n\n    // Calculate the sum of the numbers\n    for (int num : numbers) {\n        sum += num;\n    }\n\n    // Display the result\n    std::cout << \"The sum of [\";\n    for (size_t i = 0; i < numbers.size(); ++i) {\n        std::cout << numbers[i];\n        if (i != numbers.size() - 1) {\n            std::cout << \", \";\n        }\n    }\n    std::cout << \"] is \" << sum << \".\" << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Steps to Compile and Run:\n\n1. Save the above code in a file, say `sum_numbers.cpp`.\n2. Ensure you have `nlohmann/json.hpp` in your include path.\n3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler, for example:\n   ```bash\n   g++ -o sum_numbers sum_numbers.cpp -std=c++11\n   ```\n4. Run the compiled program:\n   ```bash\n   ./sum_numbers\n   ```\n\n### Note:\n- Make sure the `numbers.json` file is in the same directory as your compiled program, or provide the correct path to it in the `std::ifstream file(\"numbers.json\");` line.\n- If you encounter any compilation errors related to the JSON library, ensure that you have included the `nlohmann/json` header correctly and that it's available in your include path."
