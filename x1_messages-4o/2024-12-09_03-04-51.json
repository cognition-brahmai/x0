I'm confused because the description of Tensorflow's tf.layers.batch_normalization suggests performing batch normalization with respect to the channels. However, I seem to recall having used the other approach with good results."

        "content": "In Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), batch normalization is typically applied to the channels of the feature maps, not on a per-pixel basis. This means that for each feature map channel, batch normalization computes the mean and variance across the batch, height, and width dimensions, and then normalizes the values in that channel using these statistics.\n\nHere's a bit more detail:\n\n1. **Channel-wise Normalization**: In this approach, for each channel, you compute the mean and variance over all the pixels in that channel across the batch. This is the standard practice and is what TensorFlow's `tf.layers.batch_normalization` (or its updated versions in TensorFlow 2.x like `tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization`) typically does. This method helps in stabilizing the learning process by normalizing the activations across the entire channel, thus reducing internal covariate shift.\n\n2. **Pixel-wise Normalization**: Normalizing each pixel individually is not a common practice in CNNs. This would involve computing a mean and variance for each individual pixel position across the batch, essentially treating each pixel location as its own feature. While you might have seen some positive results with this method, it could potentially lead to less stable training since it treats each pixel location independently rather than considering the spatial coherence that channel-wise normalization maintains.\n\nThe channel-wise approach is generally preferred because it maintains the spatial structure of the data, which is crucial for CNNs, given that spatial hierarchies and patterns are what these networks aim to learn. It also helps in making the network more robust and aids in faster convergence during training.\n\nIf you have experienced good results with the pixel-wise approach, it might be specific to certain architectures or datasets, but it is not the conventional methodology. If you are experimenting, it's always interesting to try different approaches, but for standard practice and reproducibility, sticking to channel-wise normalization is recommended."
