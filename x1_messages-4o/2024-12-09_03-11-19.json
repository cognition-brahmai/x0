It was working as expected, logging my messages, but after rearranging some packages and modules, I'm getting a KeyError: 'formatters'. I'm using Mac OS X 10.9.2, Eclipse Kepler with PyDev and Python 3.3, but I've also tested it on a Raspberry Pi with Raspbian Wheezy and Python 3.2 and in Eclipse with Python 2.7 and I'm getting the same error. Here is the traceback I'm seeing:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Volumes/Daten/Eclipse/workspace/Carputer/src/pyboard/__init__.py\", line 42, in <module>\n    logging.config.fileConfig('../logging.conf', disable_existing_loggers=False)\n  File \"/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.3/lib/python3.3/logging/config.py\", line 70, in fileConfig\n    formatters = _create_formatters(cp)\n  File \"/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.3/lib/python3.3/logging/config.py\", line 103, in _create_formatters\n    flist = cp[\"formatters\"][\"keys\"]\n  File \"/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.3/lib/python3.3/configparser.py\", line 937, in __getitem__\n    raise KeyError(key)\nKeyError: 'formatters'\n```\n\nAnd here is my logging file:\n\n```\n[loggers]\nkeys=root,pyBoard\n\n[handlers]\nkeys=consoleHandler\n\n[formatters]\nkeys=detailedFormatter\n\n[logger_root]\nlevel=DEBUG\nhandlers=consoleHandler\n\n[logger_pyBoard]\nlevel=DEBUG\nhandlers=consoleHandler\nqualname=pyBoard\npropagate=0\n\n[handler_consoleHandler]\nclass=StreamHandler\nlevel=DEBUG\nformatter=detailedFormatter\nargs=(sys.stdout,)\n\n[formatter_detailedFormatter]\nformat=%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s : Line %(lineno)s - %(message)s\ndatefmt=\n```\n\nAnd the relevant section of my code looks like this:\n\n```\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n\n    logging.config.fileConfig('../logging.conf', disable_existing_loggers=False)\n    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n    obc = Onboard_computer('/dev/ttys001')\n    obc.run()\n```\n\nI've followed the Python Logging Tutorial closely, but I can't figure out why this is happening. Can anyone help me solve this issue?"

        "content": "The `KeyError: 'formatters'` in your logging configuration usually indicates that there is an issue with the way your logging configuration file is being read or parsed. This error suggests that the configuration parser is unable to find the section `[formatters]` or its contents. Here are some steps to help you troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **File Path**: Make sure that the path to your logging configuration file (`../logging.conf`) is correct relative to the current working directory of your script. You can use `os.path.abspath()` to print the absolute path and verify it.\n\n2. **File Encoding**: Ensure that your logging configuration file is saved with the correct encoding (e.g., UTF-8) and does not have any invisible characters or byte order marks that could affect parsing.\n\n3. **Config File Format**: Double-check the syntax and format of your `logging.conf` file. Ensure that there are no leading or trailing spaces or tabs that could interfere with parsing. It should be formatted exactly as expected by the `configparser`.\n\n4. **Readability**: Verify that the file is readable before attempting to load it. Add some debugging code to check if the file exists and can be opened without errors:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n\n   config_path = '../logging.conf'\n   if not os.path.exists(config_path):\n       raise FileNotFoundError(f\"Logging configuration file not found: {config_path}\")\n   if not os.access(config_path, os.R_OK):\n       raise PermissionError(f\"Logging configuration file is not readable: {config_path}\")\n   ```\n\n5. **Debugging**: Add some print statements before and after loading the configuration to ensure the execution flow is as expected.\n\n6. **Testing**: As a sanity check, try a minimal configuration to ensure that the basic setup works:\n\n   ```ini\n   [loggers]\n   keys=root\n\n   [handlers]\n   keys=consoleHandler\n\n   [formatters]\n   keys=detailedFormatter\n\n   [logger_root]\n   level=DEBUG\n   handlers=consoleHandler\n\n   [handler_consoleHandler]\n   class=StreamHandler\n   level=DEBUG\n   formatter=detailedFormatter\n   args=(sys.stdout,)\n\n   [formatter_detailedFormatter]\n   format=%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s : Line %(lineno)s - %(message)s\n   ```\n\n7. **Python Version Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility between your Python version and the logging configuration format. Although you mentioned testing across different Python versions, ensure that the configuration syntax is compatible with each version.\n\n8. **Logging Module Import**: Ensure you have the correct import statements at the top of your script:\n\n   ```python\n   import logging\n   import logging.config\n   import sys\n   ```\n\nBy going through these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue with the `KeyError: 'formatters'`. If the problem persists, consider using an inline dictionary configuration with `logging.config.dictConfig()` to bypass file reading issues."
