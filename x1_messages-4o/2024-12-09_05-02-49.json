Post installation, whenever I open a new terminal window, I get an error related to Python Virtualenv. The error message states `ImportError: No module named virtualenvwrapper.hook_loader` and suggests that I check if virtualenv is installed for `VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python` and if the PATH is set properly. In addition, when I tried `easy_install eventlet`, I received another error saying `pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: setuptools==0.6c11`. Can someone assist me on how to resolve this issue?"

        "content": "It seems like there are a couple of issues related to Python virtual environments and package management on your MacBook Pro after installing Lion. Let's address them step by step:\n\n1. **Virtualenvwrapper Issue:**\n\n   The error `ImportError: No module named virtualenvwrapper.hook_loader` indicates that the virtualenvwrapper is not properly installed or its path is not set correctly.\n\n   - First, ensure that `virtualenvwrapper` is installed. You can install it using `pip`:\n\n     ```bash\n     pip install virtualenvwrapper\n     ```\n\n   - After installation, you need to set up the environment variables in your shell configuration file (like `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc` if you're using Zsh). Add the following lines to your configuration file:\n\n     ```bash\n     export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs\n     export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python\n     source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh\n     ```\n\n   - Reload the configuration file by running:\n\n     ```bash\n     source ~/.bashrc   # or source ~/.bash_profile or source ~/.zshrc\n     ```\n\n2. **Setuptools Error:**\n\n   The error `pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: setuptools==0.6c11` suggests that a specific version of `setuptools` is not found. This can be resolved by upgrading `setuptools`:\n\n   - Upgrade `setuptools` using `pip`:\n\n     ```bash\n     pip install --upgrade setuptools\n     ```\n\n   - If you encounter issues with `easy_install`, it's recommended to use `pip` instead, as `pip` is the more modern and preferred tool for package management in Python.\n\n3. **General Recommendations:**\n\n   - Ensure that your Python and pip are updated. You can update pip using:\n\n     ```bash\n     python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n     ```\n\n   - If you are using multiple versions of Python, ensure that the correct version is being used for virtualenvwrapper by setting `VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON` to the path of your desired Python version.\n\n   - If problems persist, consider creating a new virtual environment to ensure a clean setup:\n\n     ```bash\n     mkvirtualenv myenv\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issues with your Python virtual environment on your MacBook Pro. Let me know if you need further assistance!"
