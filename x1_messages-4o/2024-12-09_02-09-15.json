I am dealing with old versions of PyTorch and torchvision due to hardware constraints, especially when using ppc64le IBM architectures. As a result, I am experiencing issues when transmitting and receiving checkpoints across different machines, clusters, and my personal mac. Is there a method to load models to avoid this problem? For instance, saving models in both old and new formats when using 1.6.x. I am looking for a solution where I won't have to worry about it and can always save and load my checkpoints and everything I usually pickle uniformly across all my hardware. However, I am encountering errors related to zip jit and different PyTorch versions, which I am obliged to use. \n\nHere's my code:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\ndef load(path):\n    import torch\n    import pickle\n    import dill\n\n    path = str(path)\n    try:\n        db = torch.load(path)\n        f = db['f']\n    except Exception as e:\n        db = torch.jit.load(path)\n        f = db['f']\n    return db, f\n\np = \"~/data/f.pt\"\npath = Path(p).expanduser()\n\ndb, f = load(path)\n\nDin, nb_examples = 1, 5\nx = torch.distributions.Normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0).sample(sample_shape=(nb_examples, Din))\n\ny = f(x)\n\nprint(y)\nprint('Success!\\a')\n```\n\nHere's the error I am encountering:\n\n```python\nRuntimeError: version_number <= kMaxSupportedFileFormatVersion INTERNAL ASSERT FAILED at /opt/anaconda/conda-bld/pytorch-base_1581395437985/work/caffe2/serialize/inline_container.cc:131, please report a bug to PyTorch. Attempted to read a PyTorch file with version 3, but the maximum supported version for reading is 1. Your PyTorch installation may be too old.\n```\n\nAny suggestions on how to achieve consistency across the clusters? I am unable to even open the pickle files."

        "content": "Loading checkpoints across different versions of PyTorch, especially when dealing with older versions and different architectures like ppc64le and x86, can be challenging. The inconsistency in file formats and serialization protocols across versions complicates the process. Here are some strategies you can employ to maintain compatibility:\n\n### 1. Use State Dictionaries\nInstead of saving the entire model using `torch.save()`, which includes the model architecture and other metadata, save only the model's state dictionary. This approach is often more version-tolerant.\n\n**Saving the state dictionary:**\n```python\n# Assuming `model` is your PyTorch model\ntorch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model_state.pth')\n```\n\n**Loading the state dictionary:**\n```python\n# Assuming `model` is your model architecture\nmodel.load_state_dict(torch.load('model_state.pth', map_location='cpu'))\n```\n\n### 2. Avoid JIT Serialization\nJIT serialization can cause compatibility issues between versions. If possible, avoid using `torch.jit.save()` and instead rely on state_dict serialization.\n\n### 3. Use `map_location`\nWhen loading models across different architectures or hardware, use the `map_location` argument to ensure compatibility.\n\n```python\nstate_dict = torch.load('model_state.pth', map_location=torch.device('cpu'))\nmodel.load_state_dict(state_dict)\n```\n\n### 4. Save in a Compatible Format\nIf you must use code across different versions, consider saving the model in a format that both versions can read. PyTorch's pickle protocol can sometimes be a source of issues, so ensure the version used for saving is compatible with the version used for loading.\n\n### 5. Handle Version Incompatibility\nFor cases where you encounter serialization version errors, you may need to:\n\n- **Update PyTorch:** If possible, update the older PyTorch installation to at least a version that supports the serialized format.\n- **Re-save on a Compatible Version:** Load the model on a compatible version and re-save it using `state_dict`.\n\n### 6. Use ONNX for Interoperability\nIf the above methods do not work due to hardware constraints or architecture differences, consider exporting your models to the ONNX format, which provides a consistent way to save models independent of PyTorch versions.\n\n**Export to ONNX:**\n```python\ndummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)\ntorch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, \"model.onnx\")\n```\n\n**Load ONNX model (using ONNX Runtime):**\n```python\nimport onnxruntime as ort\n\nort_sess = ort.InferenceSession(\"model.onnx\")\noutputs = ort_sess.run(None, {\"input\": x.numpy()})\n```\n\n### 7. Debugging and Testing\nEnsure your loading script is tested on both hardware architectures. You might need to include checks and logs to identify which part of the process fails and adapt accordingly.\n\nBy following these strategies, you can improve the consistency of loading checkpoints across different PyTorch versions and hardware architectures, minimizing version-related issues."
