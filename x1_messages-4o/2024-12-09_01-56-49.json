For example, I want a function `remove_values_from_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 3], 2)` to return `[1, 3, 4, 3]`. How can I do this?"

        "content": "To remove all occurrences of a specific value from a list in Python, you can use a list comprehension to create a new list that includes only the elements that are not equal to the value you want to remove. Here's how you can define a function to do this:\n\n```python\ndef remove_values_from_list(lst, value):\n    return [item for item in lst if item != value]\n\n# Example usage:\nresult = remove_values_from_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 3], 2)\nprint(result)  # Output: [1, 3, 4, 3]\n```\n\nIn this function, `lst` is the list from which you want to remove the value, and `value` is the value you want to remove. The list comprehension `[item for item in lst if item != value]` constructs a new list by iterating over each `item` in `lst` and including it in the new list only if it is not equal to `value`. This effectively removes all occurrences of `value` from the list."
