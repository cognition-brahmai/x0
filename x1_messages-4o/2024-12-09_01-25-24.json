I followed the steps from the official PyTorch website, but I'm running into an ImportError when I try to import torch. The error says \"from torch._C import * ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.\" I've tried to follow instructions from some GitHub issues (#4518 and #574) related to this problem, but the error persists. The full traceback is as follows:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"D:\\CFPS.py\", line 1, in <module>\nimport torch\nFile \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Python35\\lib\\site-packages\\torch\\__init__.py\", \nline 78, in <module>\nfrom torch._C import *\nImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.\n[Finished in 0.6s]\n```\n\nHow can I resolve this issue and successfully import torch?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is a common problem when trying to import PyTorch on certain systems, particularly if there are mismatches in dependencies or missing DLLs. Here are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Python Version Compatibility:**  \n   PyTorch support for Python 3.5 has been discontinued. It would be best to upgrade your Python version to at least Python 3.6 or later. Consider using Python 3.8 or 3.9 for better compatibility and support.\n\n2. **Update PyTorch Installation:**  \n   Make sure you are installing a compatible version of PyTorch for your Python environment. Use the following command to install PyTorch with CPU support:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install torch==1.x.x+cpu torchvision==0.x.x+cpu torchaudio==0.x.x+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html\n   ```\n\n   Replace `1.x.x`, `0.x.x` with the latest versions compatible with your Python version.\n\n3. **Check for Missing Dependencies:**  \n   PyTorch may have dependencies that need to be installed manually. Check if you have the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio installed, as PyTorch relies on it. You can download it from the [Microsoft website](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).\n\n4. **Environment Variables:**  \n   Ensure that your environment variables include paths to the necessary libraries. Sometimes, adding the path to the DLL files in your system's PATH variable can resolve the issue.\n\n5. **Verify Installation Path:**  \n   Ensure that PyTorch is installed in the correct Python environment. If you have multiple Python installations, you might be installing PyTorch in a different environment. Use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `myenv\\Scripts\\activate`\n   pip install torch==1.x.x+cpu torchvision==0.x.x+cpu\n   ```\n\n6. **Alternative Installation Methods:**  \n   If `pip` fails, consider using `conda` to install PyTorch, as it may handle dependencies more gracefully:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda create -n myenv python=3.8\n   conda activate myenv\n   conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch\n   ```\n\n7. **Check for Conflicts:**  \n   Ensure there are no conflicting packages that might be causing the import error. You can do this by creating a fresh virtual environment and installing only PyTorch to see if the issue persists.\n\nIf you follow these steps and still encounter issues, please provide additional details about your system configuration and any additional error messages you might see."
