        "content": "In Python, you can use the `re` module to work with regular expressions. To replace only the first occurrence of a pattern in a string, you can use the `re.sub()` function with the `count` parameter set to 1. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Define the input string\ninput_string = \"The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain.\"\n\n# Define the pattern to match\npattern = r\"in\"\n\n# Define the replacement string\nreplacement = \"on\"\n\n# Replace only the first occurrence of the pattern\nresult = re.sub(pattern, replacement, input_string, count=1)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nIn this example, the pattern `\"in\"` is replaced with `\"on\"` only for the first occurrence, resulting in the output:\n\n```\nThe raon in Spain stays mainly in the plain.\n```\n\nYou can adjust the `pattern` and `replacement` variables to suit your needs."
