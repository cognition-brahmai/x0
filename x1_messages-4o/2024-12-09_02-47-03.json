When you create an instance of the `Child` class, it also initializes the `Parent` class, and thus inherits its attributes. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nclass Parent():\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.myvar = 1\n\nclass Child(Parent):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()  # This is a cleaner way to initialize the parent class\n        \n        # Accessing myvar through self\n        print(self.myvar)\n\nchild = Child()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- The `super().__init__()` call is used to initialize the parent class. It\u2019s a more modern and preferred way to call the parent class's `__init__` method, compared to directly calling `Parent.__init__(self)`.\n  \n- You access `myvar` using `self.myvar`, because `self` refers to the instance of `Child` which has inherited `myvar` from `Parent`."
