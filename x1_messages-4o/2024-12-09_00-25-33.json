The code I am using is:\n\n```python\ncv2.putText(image,\"Hello World!!!\", (x,y), cv2.CV_FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 2, 255)\n```\n\nHowever, I am getting an error that says 'module' object has no attribute 'CV_FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX'. I'm not sure if I can use the font type as above. I've searched the internet, but only found the syntax related to OpenCV C++ for initFont. I then tried to use `putText` to pass the font type as a parameter but that didn't work either. Can anyone suggest a solution for overlaying text on an image in OpenCV2?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the incorrect usage of the font constant in OpenCV. In OpenCV's Python API, font constants are prefixed with `cv2.FONT_` instead of `cv2.CV_FONT_`. Additionally, the color parameter expects a tuple representing the BGR color values, not a single integer.\n\nHere's the corrected code to overlay text on an image using OpenCV in Python:\n\n```python\nimport cv2\n\n# Load an image\nimage = cv2.imread('path_to_image.jpg')\n\n# Define the text, position, font, size, color, and thickness\ntext = \"Hello World!!!\"\nposition = (x, y)\nfont = cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX\nfont_scale = 2\ncolor = (255, 255, 255)  # White color in BGR\nthickness = 2\n\n# Put the text on the image\ncv2.putText(image, text, position, font, font_scale, color, thickness)\n\n# Display the image\ncv2.imshow('Image with Text', image)\ncv2.waitKey(0)\ncv2.destroyAllWindows()\n```\n\nReplace `'path_to_image.jpg'` with the path to your image, and `(x, y)` with the coordinates where you want the text to appear on the image.\n\nMake sure to import OpenCV using `import cv2` and have a valid image file path. Adjust the `font_scale`, `color`, and `thickness` parameters as needed for your specific requirements."
