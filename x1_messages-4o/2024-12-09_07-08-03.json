I have tried using the `timeit` module as shown in the code below but I'm having trouble getting it to work correctly. \n\n```python\nimport timeit\nstart = timeit.timeit()\nprint(\"hello\")\nend = timeit.timeit()\nprint(end - start)\n```"

        "content": "The issue with your code is that the `timeit.timeit()` function is not meant to be used directly for measuring elapsed time like a stopwatch. Instead, it's designed to repeatedly execute a statement and return the time it took to execute. To measure the elapsed time for a specific function or block of code, you can use the `time` module instead. Here's how you can modify your code to measure the elapsed time:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\n# Start the timer\nstart = time.time()\n\n# Code block to measure\nprint(\"hello\")\n\n# End the timer\nend = time.time()\n\n# Calculate the elapsed time\nelapsed_time = end - start\nprint(f\"Elapsed time: {elapsed_time} seconds\")\n```\n\nThis will give you the elapsed time in seconds that it took to execute the `print(\"hello\")` statement. If you need more precision or are looking to measure very short durations, you can also use `time.perf_counter()` which provides a higher resolution timer.\n\nHere's an example using `time.perf_counter()`:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\n# Start the timer\nstart = time.perf_counter()\n\n# Code block to measure\nprint(\"hello\")\n\n# End the timer\nend = time.perf_counter()\n\n# Calculate the elapsed time\nelapsed_time = end - start\nprint(f\"Elapsed time: {elapsed_time} seconds\")\n```\n\nThis method is more suitable for performance measurements where higher accuracy is needed."
