Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ntuples_list = [(1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (3, 'three')]\nfirst_elements = [t[0] for t in tuples_list]\n```\n\nThis code snippet will give you the desired output:\n\n```python\n[1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nIn this list comprehension, `t` represents each tuple in `tuples_list`, and `t[0]` extracts the first element from each tuple. The result is a new list containing all the first elements from the tuples."
