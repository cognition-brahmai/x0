Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\n# Assuming df is your DataFrame\ndf.index.name = None\n```\n\nAfter running this line of code, the output will be:\n\n```python\nIn [10]: df\nOut[10]: \n         Column 1\nApples          1\nOranges         2\nPuppies         3\nDucks           4\n```\n\nThis effectively removes the index name from your DataFrame."
