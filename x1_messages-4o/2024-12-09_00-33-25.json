My spider and pipelines are functioning as expected, but the issue arises with the logs. The logs are printing out the full Scrapy Item as it exits the pipeline. Here's an example of what gets printed in the logs:\n\n```\n2013-01-17 18:42:17-0600 [tutorial] DEBUG: processing Pipeline pipeline module\n2013-01-17 18:42:17-0600 [tutorial] DEBUG: Scraped from <200 http://www.example.com>\n    {'attr1': 'value1',\n     'attr2': 'value2',\n     'attr3': 'value3',\n     ...\n     snip\n     ...\n     'attrN': 'valueN'}\n2013-01-17 18:42:18-0600 [tutorial] INFO: Closing spider (finished)\n```\n\nI want to avoid having all this data cluttering up the log files. Is there a way to suppress this output?"

        "content": "Certainly! To reduce or suppress the amount of data being logged for Scrapy Items in your logs, you can adjust the logging level or customize the logging output. Here are a few strategies you can consider:\n\n1. **Adjust Logging Level**: Change the logging level for your Scrapy project to a higher level, like `INFO` or `WARNING`, in order to suppress `DEBUG` messages. You can do this by modifying your Scrapy project's `settings.py`:\n\n    ```python\n    LOG_LEVEL = 'INFO'\n    ```\n\n   This will prevent `DEBUG` level messages from appearing in your logs, including the detailed item outputs.\n\n2. **Customize Logging**: You can define a custom logging handler or filter to modify how items are logged. For example, you can create a custom logging filter that limits the amount of item data being printed:\n\n    ```python\n    import logging\n\n    class ItemFilter(logging.Filter):\n        def filter(self, record):\n            if record.getMessage().startswith('Scraped from'):\n                # Modify the message to show only a snippet of the item\n                record.msg = record.msg.split('\\n')[0] + ' ... (item data truncated)'\n            return True\n\n    LOGGING = {\n        'version': 1,\n        'disable_existing_loggers': False,\n        'filters': {\n            'item_filter': {\n                '()': ItemFilter,\n            },\n        },\n        'handlers': {\n            'console': {\n                'level': 'DEBUG',\n                'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',\n                'filters': ['item_filter'],\n            },\n        },\n        'loggers': {\n            'scrapy': {\n                'handlers': ['console'],\n                'level': 'DEBUG',\n            },\n        },\n    }\n    ```\n\n   Add this configuration to your `settings.py`. This example modifies the message for items being scraped to only show a snippet.\n\n3. **Override the Logging in Pipelines**: If you want to control the logging specifically in your pipeline, you can override the logging behavior there. For example, modify how the item is logged in the pipeline:\n\n    ```python\n    import logging\n\n    class MyPipeline:\n        def __init__(self):\n            self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n        def process_item(self, item, spider):\n            # Log a compact version of the item\n            self.logger.debug(f'Processing item with id: {item.get(\"id\", \"unknown\")}')\n            # Continue processing the item\n            return item\n    ```\n\nBy applying one or more of these strategies, you should be able to control the verbosity of your logs and suppress the full output of Scrapy items."
