        "content": "Yes, you're correct that the issue might be related to pip not being proxy-aware, especially if you're working in an environment where internet access is controlled through a proxy server. When pip tries to connect to the Python Package Index (PyPI) to download packages, it needs to go through the proxy, but it might not be configured to do so by default.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Configure Proxy Settings for pip:**\n\n   You can set your proxy settings using environment variables. Open a terminal or command prompt and set the following variables:\n\n   On Windows:\n   ```shell\n   set HTTP_PROXY=http://username:password@proxyserver:port\n   set HTTPS_PROXY=https://username:password@proxyserver:port\n   ```\n\n   On macOS/Linux:\n   ```shell\n   export HTTP_PROXY=http://username:password@proxyserver:port\n   export HTTPS_PROXY=https://username:password@proxyserver:port\n   ```\n\n   Replace `username`, `password`, `proxyserver`, and `port` with your actual proxy credentials and details. If your proxy does not require authentication, you can omit `username:password@`.\n\n2. **Configure pip to use the proxy:**\n\n   You can also configure pip to use a proxy by editing or creating a `pip.ini` or `pip.conf` file depending on your operating system:\n\n   - **Windows:** Create or edit a file at `%APPDATA%\\pip\\pip.ini`\n   - **macOS/Linux:** Create or edit a file at `~/.pip/pip.conf`\n\n   Add the following to the file:\n\n   ```ini\n   [global]\n   proxy = http://username:password@proxyserver:port\n   ```\n\n3. **Use the `--proxy` option with pip:**\n\n   You can also specify the proxy directly in the pip command using the `--proxy` option:\n\n   ```shell\n   pip install numpy --proxy http://username:password@proxyserver:port\n   ```\n\n4. **Check with Your Network Administrator:**\n\n   Sometimes, corporate networks may require additional settings or have specific proxy configurations. It's a good idea to check with your IT or network administrator to ensure you have the correct proxy settings.\n\n5. **Use a Package Manager:**\n\n   If the above steps don't work, consider using a package manager like Anaconda, which might handle proxies differently and could provide a simpler setup for scientific packages like numpy.\n\nBy setting the proxy correctly, you should be able to resolve the connection timeout issue and install packages using pip."
