Currently, I am using the following code where I initialize a list and then append the dates to it in a loop. Is there a more efficient way to achieve this?\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\na = datetime.datetime.today()\nnumdays = 100\ndateList = []\nfor x in range (0, numdays):\n    dateList.append(a - datetime.timedelta(days = x))\nprint dateList\n```"

        "content": "Your current approach works perfectly fine, but there is a more concise and efficient way to achieve the same result by using list comprehension. This method reduces the number of lines in your code and is generally faster due to its optimization in Python. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\nnumdays = 100\ndateList = [(datetime.datetime.today() - datetime.timedelta(days=x)).date() for x in range(numdays)]\nprint(dateList)\n```\n\nThis code does the following:\n- Uses list comprehension to generate the list of dates.\n- Calculates each date by subtracting `x` days from today's date.\n- `(datetime.datetime.today() - datetime.timedelta(days=x)).date()` ensures that only the date part is added to the list, which might be more desirable if you don't need the time component.\n\nThis way, you achieve the same result with a more Pythonic and efficient approach."
