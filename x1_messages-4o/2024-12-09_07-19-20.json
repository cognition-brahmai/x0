I usually use methods such as 'assertEqual', 'assertTrue', etc. However, these methods all require a return value from the function being tested. How can I conduct a unit test on a function that does not have a return value? For instance, how can I test the function 'foo(self, msg)' in the following 'HelloTest' class?\n\n```python\nclass HelloTest(object):\n    def foo(self, msg):\n        MSG = msg.upper()\n        self.bar(MSG)\n\n    def bar(self, MSG):\n        print MSG\n```"

        "content": "When you want to test a function that doesn't return a value, like `foo(self, msg)` in your `HelloTest` class, you can focus on testing its side effects or the interactions it triggers. In this example, `foo` transforms the input and calls another method, `bar`, with the transformed data. You can test this behavior by using mocking techniques to verify that `bar` was called with the expected argument.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide using `unittest` and `unittest.mock` to test the `foo` method:\n\n1. **Import the necessary modules**: You'll need `unittest` for writing the test and `unittest.mock` to mock methods.\n\n2. **Mock the `bar` method**: You can use `unittest.mock.patch.object` to replace `bar` with a mock that lets you verify how it was called.\n\n3. **Write the test case**: Check that `bar` is called with the correct uppercase version of the input message.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\n\nclass HelloTest(object):\n    def foo(self, msg):\n        MSG = msg.upper()\n        self.bar(MSG)\n\n    def bar(self, MSG):\n        print(MSG)\n\nclass TestHelloTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def test_foo_calls_bar_with_uppercase_msg(self):\n        # Create an instance of HelloTest\n        hello_test = HelloTest()\n        \n        # Mock the bar method\n        with patch.object(hello_test, 'bar') as mock_bar:\n            # Call the foo method with a sample message\n            hello_test.foo('hello')\n            \n            # Assert that bar was called with 'HELLO'\n            mock_bar.assert_called_once_with('HELLO')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **patch.object**: This is used to temporarily replace the `bar` method in the `hello_test` instance with a mock object. This allows you to track its calls and check the arguments it received.\n- **assert_called_once_with**: This assertion checks that the mock method was called exactly once and with the specified argument, which should be the uppercase version of the input message.\n\nThis approach lets you verify that the side effect of the `foo` method (calling `bar` with the transformed message) is correct, even though `foo` itself doesn't return anything."
