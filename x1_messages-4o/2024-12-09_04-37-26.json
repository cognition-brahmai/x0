How can I fix this error and give shape to my `X_train` so that MLP will accept it as an input?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering stems from trying to use the `add` method, which is not available for Python lists. Instead, you should use the `append` method to add elements to a list. Additionally, you need to ensure that your query is properly defined to fetch data from the database. Here's how you can fix your code:\n\n1. Use `append` instead of `add` to add rows to `X_train`.\n2. Define your query to fetch data from the database.\n3. Ensure that you process each row correctly to match the expected input shape for an MLP, which typically requires a 2D array where each row is a sample and each column is a feature.\n\nHere's the revised code:\n\n```python\nimport mysql.connector\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Connect to the MySQL database\nconnection = mysql.connector.connect(\n    host='localhost', \n    port=3306, \n    user='root', \n    passwd='mysql', \n    db='medicalgame'\n)\n\ncur = connection.cursor()\n\n# Define your SQL query to fetch data\nquery = \"SELECT * FROM your_table_name\"  # Replace 'your_table_name' with your actual table name\n\ncur.execute(query)\n\n# X_train will be a list of list, each inner list is a row from the database\nX_train = []\n\nfor row in cur:\n    X_train.append(list(row))  # Use append and convert row to a list\n\nconnection.close()\n\n# Convert X_train to a numpy ndarray\nX_train = np.asarray(X_train)\n\nprint('The shape of X_train is', X_train.shape)\n\n# Make sure X_train is reshaped appropriately for your MLP\n# For example, if you need to ensure it has the correct number of features:\n# X_train = X_train.reshape((number_of_samples, number_of_features))\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `'your_table_name'` with the actual name of your table in the database. Also, adjust the reshaping of `X_train` if needed, depending on how your MLP expects the input data to be structured. The shape of your input should align with the input layer of your MLP model, which usually requires a 2D array where each row is a sample and each column is a feature."
