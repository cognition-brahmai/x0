Here's a breakdown of how it works and how you can implement it:\n\n### Step-by-Step Implementation\n\n1. **Create the PHP File:**\n\n   - Open a text editor and create a new PHP file named `relativity.php`.\n   - Insert the following code to define and echo the explanation:\n\n   ```php\n   <?php\n   $explanation = \"Insert your explanation of Einstein's theory of relativity here\";\n   echo \"<div class='relativity'>$explanation</div>\";\n   ?>\n   ```\n\n   - Replace the placeholder text with your own detailed explanation of Einstein's theory of relativity.\n\n2. **Include the PHP File in Your HTML:**\n\n   - In your HTML file, decide where you want the explanation to appear.\n   - Use the `include` statement to insert the content of `relativity.php` into your HTML:\n\n   ```html\n   <div class=\"explanation\">\n     <?php include 'relativity.php'; ?>\n   </div>\n   ```\n\n   - This will dynamically include the content from `relativity.php` into the specified location in your HTML.\n\n3. **Style the Explanation with CSS:**\n\n   - Open your CSS file and style the `.relativity` class to ensure the explanation is displayed with your desired formatting:\n\n   ```css\n   .relativity {\n     font-size: 16px;\n     line-height: 1.5;\n     color: #333;\n     /* Add more styles as needed */\n   }\n   ```\n\n   - You can adjust the font size, line height, color, and any other CSS properties to suit your design preferences.\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- **Security Considerations:** Ensure that your PHP file does not expose any sensitive data and is securely configured to prevent unauthorized access.\n- **Dynamic Content:** If you plan to include additional explanations or content, consider using a database or a content management system to dynamically manage the content.\n- **Responsive Design:** Ensure your CSS styles are responsive to different screen sizes for a better user experience.\n\nBy following these steps, you can efficiently embed and style an explanation of Einstein's theory of relativity on your web page using PHP and HTML."
