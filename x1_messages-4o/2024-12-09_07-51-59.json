Currently, I'm using the following code:\n\n```python\nim = cv2.imread(path,0)\nprint im\n```\n\nThe output I get is:\n\n```python\n[[25 25 28 ...,  0  0  0]\n[ 0  0  0 ...,  0  0  0]\n[ 0  0  0 ...,  0  0  0]\n..., \n```\n\nHow can I modify my code so that it correctly loads the image as 16-bit?"

        "content": "To read a 16-bit grayscale image using OpenCV, you need to specify the correct flag when calling `cv2.imread`. The default flag `0` loads the image as grayscale, but it does not explicitly specify the bit depth, which might lead to it being interpreted as 8-bit.\n\nTo ensure you're loading a 16-bit image, you should use the `cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED` flag. This flag tells OpenCV to load the image as is, preserving the original bit depth. Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport cv2\n\n# Load the image with the IMREAD_UNCHANGED flag\nim = cv2.imread(path, cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED)\n\n# Check the data type to ensure it's 16-bit\nprint(im.dtype)\n\n# Print the image data to verify\nprint(im)\n```\n\nBy using `cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED`, you ensure that the image is loaded with its original bit depth (in this case, 16-bit). Checking `im.dtype` will confirm the bit depth of the loaded image. It should print `uint16` if the image is loaded correctly as a 16-bit image."
