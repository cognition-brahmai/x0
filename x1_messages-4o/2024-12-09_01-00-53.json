However, when I implement the following code:\n\n```python\nthatLine.replace('\\n', '<br />')\nprint thatLine\n```\nI am still seeing text output with newline characters. What could be the reason for this?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the fact that the `replace` method in Python strings returns a new string with the replacements made, but it does not modify the original string in place. In your code, you are calling `replace` on `thatLine`, but you're not storing the result back to `thatLine`. Therefore, the original string remains unchanged.\n\nHere's how you can fix it:\n\n```python\nthatLine = thatLine.replace('\\n', '<br />')\nprint(thatLine)\n```\n\nBy assigning the result of `replace` back to `thatLine`, you'll update the variable with the modified string. Additionally, make sure to use parentheses with the `print` function if you're using Python 3."
