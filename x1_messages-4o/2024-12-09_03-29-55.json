It seems to not recognize certain methods such as `map`, `range` and `filter` among others, and my code completion has stopped working. When I try to use code completion with CTRL+SPACE, I get the error \"Port not bound (found port -1). Is there an enabled firewall?\" even though my code runs without any issues. I am using windows 7 and have searched for a solution but have been unable to find one. Can anyone help me with this issue?"

        "content": "It sounds like you're experiencing a couple of issues with Aptana Studio 3 after your update. Here are some steps you can try to resolve these issues:\n\n1. **Check Firewall Settings**:\n   - Ensure that your firewall is not blocking Aptana Studio or its related processes. You may need to add an exception for Aptana Studio in your firewall settings.\n\n2. **Java Installation**:\n   - Aptana Studio relies on Java, so make sure you have a compatible version of Java installed. Sometimes, updating Java to the latest version can resolve such issues.\n\n3. **Aptana Studio Configuration**:\n   - Go to `Window` > `Preferences` > `PyDev` > `Interpreters` > `Python Interpreter` and make sure that the Python interpreter is correctly configured. You might need to remove the current interpreter and re-add it.\n\n4. **Rebuild Python Environment**:\n   - In the Python Interpreter configuration, try rebuilding the environment. This can help Aptana recognize built-in functions like `map`, `range`, and `filter`.\n\n5. **Check for Plugin Issues**:\n   - Sometimes, plugin issues can cause problems with code completion. Try disabling any recently added plugins to see if this resolves the problem.\n\n6. **Reinstall Aptana Studio**:\n   - If none of the above steps work, consider reinstalling Aptana Studio. Before doing this, make sure to back up your workspace and any important settings.\n\n7. **Check for Updates or Patches**:\n   - Visit the Aptana Studio website or forums to see if there are any updates or patches available that address this specific issue.\n\n8. **Alternative Editors**:\n   - If the problem persists and you need a quick solution, consider using an alternative editor like Visual Studio Code or PyCharm, which also support Python development with robust code completion features.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to troubleshoot and hopefully resolve the issues with Aptana Studio 3. If the problem continues, consider reaching out to Aptana's support community for more detailed assistance."
