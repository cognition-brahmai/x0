I've tried putting my authorization decorator in my test.py file. However, I'm having trouble accessing `current_identity` within my authorization decorator, `authorized_api_user_type`, as it appears to be empty. In order to work around this, I had to inspect the code of `jwt_handler` and replicate what was done there. Is there a better way to do this? What's the correct way to handle authorization in flask-restful?"

        "content": "To handle authorization in a Flask application using `flask-restful` and `flask-jwt`, you should ensure that your JWT authentication and authorization mechanisms are properly integrated. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n1. **Integrate Flask-JWT**: Ensure that your application is properly set up with `flask-jwt`. You should have a JWT authentication handler and a way to identify the user (typically using `current_identity`).\n\n2. **Authorization Decorator**: Create a decorator for authorization that checks the user's permissions or roles. This decorator can be applied to your resource methods to enforce authorization policies. The key is to properly access `current_identity` which is set by `flask-jwt`.\n\n3. **Accessing `current_identity`**: `current_identity` is populated by the `jwt_required()` decorator from Flask-JWT. Ensure that this decorator is applied to your resource methods before your custom authorization decorator.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how you can set this up:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, jsonify\nfrom flask_restful import Resource, Api\nfrom flask_jwt import JWT, jwt_required, current_identity\nfrom functools import wraps\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napi = Api(app)\napp.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'super-secret'\n\n# Dummy user data\nusers = [\n    {'id': 1, 'username': 'user1', 'password': 'abcxyz', 'role': 'admin'},\n    {'id': 2, 'username': 'user2', 'password': 'abcxyz', 'role': 'user'}\n]\n\ndef authenticate(username, password):\n    user = next((u for u in users if u['username'] == username and u['password'] == password), None)\n    return user\n\ndef identity(payload):\n    user_id = payload['identity']\n    return next((u for u in users if u['id'] == user_id), None)\n\njwt = JWT(app, authenticate, identity)\n\ndef authorized_api_user_type(required_role):\n    def decorator(fn):\n        @wraps(fn)\n        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            if not current_identity or current_identity['role'] != required_role:\n                return jsonify({'message': 'Unauthorized access'}), 403\n            return fn(*args, **kwargs)\n        return wrapper\n    return decorator\n\nclass MyResource(Resource):\n    @jwt_required()\n    @authorized_api_user_type('admin')\n    def get(self):\n        return {'message': 'Hello, Admin User!'}\n\napi.add_resource(MyResource, '/resource')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Decorator Order**: Make sure that `@jwt_required()` is applied before your custom `@authorized_api_user_type` decorator. This ensures `current_identity` is set before your authorization decorator checks it.\n\n- **Custom Authorization Logic**: Your `authorized_api_user_type` decorator checks the role of the `current_identity` to determine if the user has the required permissions.\n\n- **Flexibility**: You can extend the `authorized_api_user_type` decorator to check for multiple roles or add more complex authorization logic.\n\nBy setting up your application this way, you can cleanly separate authentication and authorization concerns and ensure that your resources are accessed only by users with the correct permissions."
