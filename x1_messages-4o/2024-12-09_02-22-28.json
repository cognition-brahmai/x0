Additionally, I need to move each character in a given string X steps back in the alphabet. For example, the string \"hi\" would become \"gh\" if moved one step back.

        "content": "To find the position of a specific character in the English alphabet where 'a' or 'A' is 0, you can use Python's built-in `ord()` function, which returns the Unicode code of a character. Here's how you can calculate the position:\n\n1. For lowercase letters:\n   ```python\n   position = ord(character) - ord('a')\n   ```\n\n2. For uppercase letters:\n   ```python\n   position = ord(character) - ord('A')\n   ```\n\nTo move each character in a given string X steps back in the alphabet, you can iterate through the string and adjust each character's position accordingly. Here is a Python function that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef move_characters_back(s, steps):\n    result = []\n    for char in s:\n        # Check if the character is a lowercase or uppercase letter\n        if 'a' <= char <= 'z':\n            # Calculate new position and wrap around the alphabet if necessary\n            new_char = chr((ord(char) - ord('a') - steps) % 26 + ord('a'))\n        elif 'A' <= char <= 'Z':\n            new_char = chr((ord(char) - ord('A') - steps) % 26 + ord('A'))\n        else:\n            # If it's not a letter, don't change it\n            new_char = char\n        result.append(new_char)\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Example usage:\nstring = \"hi\"\nsteps = 1\nnew_string = move_characters_back(string, steps)\nprint(new_string)  # Output: \"gh\"\n```\n\nThis function handles both uppercase and lowercase letters and maintains non-alphabetic characters unchanged. You can adjust the `steps` parameter to move characters by a different number of steps."
