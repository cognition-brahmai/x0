I understand that prepared statements are a database feature allowing to separate parameters from the code, while parameterized queries substitute the manual string interpolation. However, there seems to be some overlapping between the two and some sources indicate they are the same. I would like to know: \n\n1. Is there a meaningful difference between a prepared statement and a parameterized query? Does this distinction matter in practice? If I use parameterized queries, do I need to worry about prepared statements?\n2. If there is a difference, what is the current status of prepared statements in the Python ecosystem? Which database adapters support prepared statements?\n\nAn example of prepared statements is:\n\n```python\nPREPARE fooplan (int, text, bool, numeric) AS\n    INSERT INTO foo VALUES($1, $2, $3, $4);\nEXECUTE fooplan(1, 'Hunter Valley', 't', 200.00);\n```\n\nAn example of a parameterized query is:\n\n```python\ncursor.execute(\"SELECT FROM tablename WHERE fieldname = %s\", [value])\n```"

        "content": "The concepts of prepared statements and parameterized queries are closely related, and while they are sometimes used interchangeably, there are subtle distinctions between them. Let's delve into your questions:\n\n1. **Meaningful Difference and Practical Distinction:**\n   - **Prepared Statements:** These are a feature of many database systems that allow you to prepare a SQL statement once and then execute it multiple times with different parameters. Prepared statements can offer performance benefits because the database can parse, compile, and optimize the statement once, and then reuse this compiled version for multiple executions. Additionally, they help prevent SQL injection by separating SQL code from data.\n   - **Parameterized Queries:** This is a technique often used in application code (like Python) to safely insert user input into a SQL query. By using placeholders and binding parameters, parameterized queries help prevent SQL injection. In many database adapters, parameterized queries are implemented using prepared statements under the hood.\n\n   In practice, when you use parameterized queries in Python with libraries like `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL or `mysql-connector-python` for MySQL, the library often handles the preparation and execution of statements for you. This means you don't need to explicitly prepare statements yourself.\n\n2. **Prepared Statements in the Python Ecosystem:**\n   - **Support by Database Adapters:**\n     - **`psycopg2` (PostgreSQL):** This library supports prepared statements. You can explicitly use them with the `prepare` method or rely on the library's automatic use of prepared statements when using parameterized queries.\n     - **`mysql-connector-python` (MySQL):** This library provides support for parameterized queries, which are often backed by prepared statements.\n     - **`sqlite3`:** The SQLite adapter in Python uses parameterized queries, and while SQLite doesn't have a separate prepared statement API in the same way as some other databases, the use of parameterized queries provides similar benefits.\n     - **`pyodbc` (ODBC):** This library provides support for parameterized queries, with many ODBC drivers using prepared statements.\n\n   In summary, while technically there is a difference in terms of what the database is doing, the distinction often doesn't matter in practice for most Python developers. By using parameterized queries, you benefit from the security and potential performance benefits of prepared statements without needing to manage them explicitly. The database libraries you use will typically handle this efficiently for you.\n\nIf you need specific control over prepared statements for optimization or other reasons, you can look into the documentation for the specific database adapter you're using to see how they can be managed manually."
