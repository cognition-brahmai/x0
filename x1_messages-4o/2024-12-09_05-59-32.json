However, their documentation is sparse and even advanced Python textbooks offer limited information. Can you explain how these methods are meant to be used and their differences, such as which has higher priority or which side of the relationship they refer to?"

        "content": "Certainly! In Python, `__subclasscheck__` and `__subclasshook__` are special methods that are part of the Abstract Base Classes (ABC) mechanism, which is used to provide a way to define interfaces when using object-oriented programming.\n\n### `__subclasscheck__`\n\n- **Purpose**: This method is used to customize the behavior of `issubclass()`. It allows you to define custom logic to determine if a class should be considered a subclass of another, even if it is not directly inherited.\n- **Implementation**: This method should be defined in a class that derives from `abc.ABCMeta`, which is the metaclass for defining abstract base classes.\n- **Priority**: `__subclasscheck__` has higher priority in the `issubclass()` check. If implemented, it will be called first to determine the subclass relationship.\n- **Relationship**: This method is called on the class that is being checked against (the \"superclass\"). For example, if you call `issubclass(Derived, Base)`, `Base.__subclasscheck__(Derived)` is invoked.\n\n### `__subclasshook__`\n\n- **Purpose**: This method provides an additional way to define subclass checks, mainly for structural (or \"duck-typed\") interfaces. It allows classes to define what it means to be a subclass based on the presence of certain methods or properties.\n- **Implementation**: Like `__subclasscheck__`, this method is also implemented in classes that derive from `abc.ABCMeta`. It is typically used to define interfaces that do not rely on inheritance.\n- **Priority**: `__subclasshook__` is called only if `__subclasscheck__` returns `NotImplemented`. It acts as a fallback mechanism, thus has lower priority compared to `__subclasscheck__`.\n- **Relationship**: This method is also called on the \"superclass\" side, but it's more focused on checking structural compliance rather than inheritance hierarchy.\n\n### Usage Example\n\nHere's a basic example illustrating how these methods might be used:\n\n```python\nimport abc\n\nclass MyABC(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):\n    @classmethod\n    def __subclasshook__(cls, subclass):\n        if cls is MyABC:\n            if any(\"my_method\" in B.__dict__ for B in subclass.__mro__):\n                return True\n        return NotImplemented\n\nclass MyClass:\n    def my_method(self):\n        pass\n\nprint(issubclass(MyClass, MyABC))  # This will be True if MyClass has 'my_method'\n```\n\n### Summary\n\n- **`__subclasscheck__`**: Directly overrides `issubclass()` behavior for a class and has higher priority.\n- **`__subclasshook__`**: Provides structural subclass checks as a fallback if `__subclasscheck__` returns `NotImplemented`.\n\nThese methods allow for flexible subclass checks, enabling both inheritance-based and interface-based designs in Python."
