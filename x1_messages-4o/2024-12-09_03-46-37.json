        "content": "The issue you're encountering arises from the fact that you're trying to load model weights as if they were a full model. When you save a model using `model.save_weights()`, you're only saving the weights of the model, not its architecture. The `load_model()` function expects a full model saved with `model.save()`, which includes both the architecture and the weights.\n\nHere's how you can properly save and load your model:\n\n### Saving the Model\n\nIf you want to save both the architecture and the weights, you should use `model.save()` instead of `model.save_weights()`. This method saves the entire model, including:\n\n- Architecture\n- Weights\n- Training configuration (loss, optimizer)\n- State of the optimizer\n\nHere's how you can save the model:\n\n```python\nmodel.save('myModel.h5')\n```\n\n### Loading the Model\n\nYou can load the model using the `load_model()` function as you were trying to do:\n\n```python\nfrom keras.models import load_model\nmodel = load_model('myModel.h5')\n```\n\n### If You Only Want to Save and Load Weights\n\nIf you only want to save and load weights, you'll need to save the model architecture separately (for example, by saving the model's JSON or YAML configuration) and then load the weights into that model. Here's how you can do it:\n\n#### Saving Weights\n\n```python\n# Save weights\nmodel.save_weights('myModel_weights.h5')\n```\n\n#### Saving Architecture\n\n```python\n# Save architecture as JSON\nmodel_json = model.to_json()\nwith open(\"model_architecture.json\", \"w\") as json_file:\n    json_file.write(model_json)\n```\n\n#### Loading Model and Weights\n\n```python\nfrom keras.models import model_from_json\n\n# Load architecture\nwith open('model_architecture.json', 'r') as json_file:\n    loaded_model_json = json_file.read()\n\n# Create model from architecture\nloaded_model = model_from_json(loaded_model_json)\n\n# Load weights into the model\nloaded_model.load_weights('myModel_weights.h5')\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you can properly save and load your Keras model and weights."
