        "content": "In non-batched reinforcement learning, I am using an environment where duration is rewarded, for instance pole-balancing, and rewards of 1 per step are given. I process this array of 1's with standard discounting and normalization to generate returns. The code I use is as follows: \n\n```python\nreturns = self.discount_rewards(rewards)\nreturns = (returns - np.mean(returns)) / (np.std(returns) + 1e-10) // usual normalization\n```\n\nFor instance, an array of rewards [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] would become an array of returns [1.539, 1.160, 0.777, 0.392, 0.006, -0.382, -0.773, -1.164, -1.556]. My question is, if positive returns are enforced and negative returns are discouraged during the optimization step, then no matter the length of the episode, approximately the first half of the actions will be encouraged and the latter half will be discouraged. Is that true, or am I misunderstanding something? If it's not true, could you please explain what I got wrong? If it is true, I don't understand why the model still trains well even though the latter half of the actions in a good-performing episode are discouraged. I would like to clarify this is non-batched learning; the returns are not relative to returns in another episode in the training step. After each episode, the model trains well."

        "content": "In your scenario, you're applying standard discounting and normalization to the reward array in a reinforcement learning context. Let's break down what you're observing and clarify why the model might still train well despite your concerns.\n\n### Understanding Reward Processing\n\n1. **Discounting**: Typically, rewards are discounted over time to prioritize earlier rewards. This means that each reward is multiplied by a discount factor (usually denoted as gamma, \\( \\gamma \\)), giving more weight to immediate rewards compared to future rewards.\n\n2. **Normalization**: After obtaining the discounted rewards, you normalize them by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. This helps stabilize the learning process by ensuring that the scale of the rewards is consistent.\n\n### Observation\n\nThe observation you've made is that after processing, the returns array tends to have positive values for the first half of the episode and negative values for the second half. This happens because of the way discounting and normalization work in tandem:\n\n- **Discounting Effect**: As you apply discounting, the impact of each reward diminishes the further it is from the current time step. This typically results in a declining pattern of returns over time.\n\n- **Normalization Effect**: By normalizing, you're centering the returns around zero. In a monotonically decreasing array (like a series of discounted rewards), this will often result in earlier (and hence higher) values being positive and later (lower) values being negative.\n\n### Why It Still Works\n\n1. **Temporal Credit Assignment**: The key role of discounting is to assign credit appropriately across time. Even if later actions are associated with negative returns, this doesn't mean they are inherently bad. Instead, they have less credit assigned to them because their contribution to the immediate outcome is smaller due to the discounting.\n\n2. **Gradient Descent Dynamics**: When updating the model, it considers the overall gradient of the returns. The optimization process doesn't just maximize positive returns and minimize negative ones in isolation but rather seeks to improve the policy based on the trajectory's cumulative effect.\n\n3. **Exploration and Policy Improvement**: The learning process incorporates exploration, which means that despite some actions being discouraged, the agent can still explore and find effective strategies. Over time, the policy improves as it learns which sequences of actions yield higher cumulative rewards.\n\n4. **Non-Batched Learning Context**: Since you're training after each episode, the model continuously updates its parameters based on the latest trajectory. This allows it to adapt quickly to what works and what doesn't, even if some actions in a high-reward episode appear to be discouraged.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile it might seem counterintuitive that some actions in a successful episode are discouraged, the overall learning process is more nuanced. The combination of discounting and normalization helps the model focus on meaningful patterns in the data, leading to effective learning despite the apparent discouragement of later actions in a sequence."
