I initially tried to connect without escaping, but received an \"InvalidURI\" error as my password contains an '@'. I then tried escaping using urllib.quote(), but received an \"Authentication failed\" error. I have confirmed that the credentials are correct by successfully connecting to the MongoDB instance using a GUI MongoDB Management Tool."

        "content": "When you're connecting to a MongoDB instance and your password contains special characters like `@`, you should encode your password properly in the connection URI. In newer versions of Python, `urllib.parse.quote_plus()` is typically used for encoding special characters in URLs. However, in Python 2, which is likely the version you're using with PyMongo 3.2.2, you should use `urllib.quote_plus()`.\n\nHere's how you can encode your password and construct the MongoDB URI:\n\n```python\nimport urllib\n\nusername = \"yourUsername\"\npassword = \"yourP@ssword\"  # Password containing '@'\nencoded_password = urllib.quote_plus(password)\n\n# Construct the connection URI\nuri = f\"mongodb://{username}:{encoded_password}@your.mongodb.host:port/yourDatabase\"\n\n# Connect using PyMongo\nfrom pymongo import MongoClient\nclient = MongoClient(uri)\n\n# Test connection\ndb = client.yourDatabase\nprint(\"Connection Successful:\", db.list_collection_names())\n```\n\nMake sure you replace `\"yourUsername\"`, `\"yourP@ssword\"`, `\"your.mongodb.host\"`, `\"port\"`, and `\"yourDatabase\"` with your actual MongoDB credentials and database information.\n\nIf you're still facing authentication issues, double-check the following:\n\n1. Ensure that there are no additional special characters in the username or password that need encoding.\n2. Verify that the database name and the host address are correct.\n3. Check for any network restrictions or firewall settings that might be affecting the connection.\n4. Make sure that your MongoDB server allows authentication from the client you're using.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to connect to your MongoDB instance without encountering the \"InvalidURI\" or \"Authentication failed\" errors."
