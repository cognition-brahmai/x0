Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you create your first web page:\n\n1. **Choose a Code Editor:**\n   - You can use any text editor like Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac). However, using a code editor like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom can make the process easier and more efficient.\n\n2. **Create a New HTML File:**\n   - Open your code editor and create a new file. Save it with a `.html` extension, such as `index.html`.\n\n3. **Basic HTML Structure:**\n   - Every HTML page starts with a basic structure. Here\u2019s a simple template you can use:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>My First Web Page</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>\n    <p>This is a simple web page created using HTML.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n4. **Understanding the HTML Structure:**\n   - `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type and version of HTML.\n   - `<html lang=\"en\">`: The root element of the HTML page with the language attribute set to English.\n   - `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document, such as the character set and the title.\n   - `<title>`: Sets the title of the web page, which appears in the browser tab.\n   - `<body>`: Contains the content that will be displayed on the web page.\n   - `<h1>`: A heading tag, with `<h1>` being the largest and `<h6>` the smallest.\n   - `<p>`: A paragraph tag for adding text content.\n\n5. **Save and View Your Web Page:**\n   - Save your HTML file and open it using a web browser by double-clicking the file. You should see the text \"Welcome to My Web Page\" as the heading and \"This is a simple web page created using HTML.\" as a paragraph.\n\n6. **Enhance with More HTML Elements:**\n   - You can add more elements such as images, links, and lists to your web page.\n\n   - **Image:**\n     ```html\n     <img src=\"image.jpg\" alt=\"Description of image\" width=\"300\">\n     ```\n\n   - **Link:**\n     ```html\n     <a href=\"https://example.com\">Visit Example</a>\n     ```\n\n   - **List:**\n     ```html\n     <ul>\n         <li>First item</li>\n         <li>Second item</li>\n     </ul>\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you can create a simple web page using HTML. As you become more comfortable, you can explore CSS and JavaScript to enhance the appearance and functionality of your web pages."
