        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to a mismatch between the types used by different CUDA APIs. In CUDA, there are two primary APIs: the Runtime API and the Driver API. Each of these APIs uses different types for error codes:\n\n1. **Runtime API** uses `cudaError_t`.\n2. **Driver API** uses `CUresult`.\n\nThe function `cudaGetErrorString()` is designed for the Runtime API and expects a `cudaError_t` as its argument, not a `CUresult`. Because `cuInit()` is from the Driver API, it returns a `CUresult`, which is why you're seeing the type mismatch error.\n\nTo get a human-readable description of a `CUresult`, you should use the Driver API's equivalent function. Unfortunately, the Driver API does not provide a direct `cudaGetErrorString` equivalent. However, NVIDIA provides a header file called `nvrtc.h` that contains a function, `cuGetErrorString`, which can be used to convert `CUresult` error codes into strings:\n\n```cpp\n#include <cuda.h>\n\nconst char* getCuErrorString(CUresult result) {\n    const char* errorName = nullptr;\n    const char* errorDesc = nullptr;\n    cuGetErrorName(result, &errorName);\n    cuGetErrorString(result, &errorDesc);\n    return errorDesc;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    CUresult res = cuInit(0);\n    if (res != CUDA_SUCCESS) {\n        const char* errorStr = getCuErrorString(res);\n        printf(\"CUDA Driver API error: %s\\n\", errorStr);\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `cuGetErrorName` returns the name of the error.\n- `cuGetErrorString` returns a description of the error.\n\nBy using these functions, you can obtain a human-readable description of the error returned by `cuInit`. Make sure to link against the CUDA Driver API when compiling your program."
