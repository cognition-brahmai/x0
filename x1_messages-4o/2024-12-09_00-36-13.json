I want each input/output pair to be tested in its own 'test_*' method. How can I accomplish this? Also, is it appropriate to define 'self.expected_pairs' in 'setUp'? Lastly, I have tried using 'doublep's' advice, but it doesn't work and no tests are run. Did I adapt the example incorrectly?"

        "content": "To generate multiple tests programmatically in Python using the `unittest` library, you can dynamically create test methods and add them to a test class. This is particularly useful when you have a set of input/output pairs and want to create a separate test case for each pair.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how you can accomplish this:\n\n1. **Define the function under test:** This is the function you want to test, for example, `under_test`.\n\n2. **Create a test class:** Use the `unittest.TestCase` class as a base.\n\n3. **Dynamically create test methods:** You can use a loop to create test methods for each input/output pair and add them to the test class.\n\n4. **Use `setUp` if necessary:** If you have common setup code, use the `setUp` method, but it's generally not used for defining test data.\n\nHere is an example implementation:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\ndef under_test(x):\n    # Example function to be tested\n    return x * 2\n\nclass DynamicTestCase(unittest.TestCase):\n    # Example input/output pairs\n    input_output_pairs = [\n        (1, 2),\n        (2, 4),\n        (3, 6),\n        (4, 8),\n    ]\n\n    @classmethod\n    def generate_test(cls, input_value, expected_output):\n        def test(self):\n            self.assertEqual(under_test(input_value), expected_output)\n        return test\n\n    @classmethod\n    def setUpClass(cls):\n        for i, (input_value, expected_output) in enumerate(cls.input_output_pairs):\n            test_name = f'test_pair_{i}'\n            test_method = cls.generate_test(input_value, expected_output)\n            setattr(cls, test_name, test_method)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Dynamic Method Creation**: The `generate_test` method generates a test method for each input/output pair. This method is then added to the test class using `setattr`.\n\n- **`setUpClass`**: This class method is used to attach dynamically created test methods to the class. It runs once for the class, rather than `setUp`, which runs before each test method.\n\n- **Test Discovery**: Ensure that the dynamically created method names start with `test_` so that `unittest` can discover them.\n\n- **Running Tests**: Use `unittest.main()` to discover and run the tests when executing the script directly.\n\n### Issues with Advice from 'doublep':\n\nIf you followed advice that didn't work, it might be due to not correctly attaching the dynamically created test methods to the test class, or not ensuring the generated test names start with `test_`. Ensure that your dynamic method creation and attachment logic is correctly implemented as shown above.\n\nThis approach should allow you to effectively generate and run a separate test for each input/output pair using the `unittest` framework."
