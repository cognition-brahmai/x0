I have set the Project Interpreter in PyCharm IDE to the path of python.exe installed with Anaconda. However, when I run a simple script:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nprint(np.pi)\n```\nI get an ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found. This does not happen when I run the same code from the Anaconda Prompt. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling numpy using conda but the problem persists. The path of the python executable in both Anaconda Prompt and Python Console of PyCharm is the same. Scripts not importing any library or importing libraries like sys or os work fine in PyCharm. It's only when I try to import a library that depends on numpy that it fails. These scripts work fine in Anaconda Prompt. Can you help me solve this problem?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely due to a mismatch in environment variables or missing dependencies for the numpy library when running your script in PyCharm, even though the Python executable path is the same. Here are several steps you can take to resolve this problem:\n\n1. **Check Environment Variables:**\n   - Ensure that the environment variables are correctly set in PyCharm. Sometimes, PyCharm doesn't inherit the environment variables from Anaconda Prompt.\n   - Go to `Run > Edit Configurations...` in PyCharm, select your running configuration, and check the \"Environment Variables\" section. Compare these with those available in your Anaconda Prompt (`echo %PATH%` in Windows or `echo $PATH` in Unix-based systems).\n\n2. **Activate the Environment in PyCharm:**\n   - Ensure that PyCharm is using the correct Conda environment. Go to `File > Settings > Project: <project_name> > Python Interpreter` and confirm that the interpreter is pointing to the correct Conda environment.\n   - If possible, activate the Conda environment manually in the terminal within PyCharm before running your script (using `conda activate <your_env_name>`).\n\n3. **Check numpy Installation:**\n   - Ensure numpy is installed correctly in your Conda environment. You can verify this by running `conda list numpy` in the Anaconda Prompt to check the version and installation status.\n\n4. **Reinstall numpy and Dependencies:**\n   - Sometimes, reinstallation can help in case of corrupted installations. Run the following commands in Anaconda Prompt:\n     ```bash\n     conda remove numpy\n     conda clean --all\n     conda install numpy\n     ```\n\n5. **Update Anaconda and PyCharm:**\n   - Make sure both Anaconda and PyCharm are up to date, as updates can resolve compatibility and environment issues.\n\n6. **Check for Missing DLLs:**\n   - The error might be due to missing DLLs. You can use a tool like Dependency Walker to check for missing dependencies in the `numpy` library.\n   - If you find missing DLLs, ensure that they are available in your system's PATH or reinstall the necessary packages.\n\n7. **Use a Virtual Environment:**\n   - If none of the above works, try creating a new virtual environment specifically for your project. This can sometimes resolve hidden configuration issues:\n     ```bash\n     conda create -n new_env_name python=3.7\n     conda activate new_env_name\n     conda install numpy pandas\n     ```\n   - Then, configure PyCharm to use this new environment.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the ImportError related to DLL load failures when running numpy in PyCharm. If the problem persists, consider checking PyCharm's logs for additional error messages that might provide more clues."
