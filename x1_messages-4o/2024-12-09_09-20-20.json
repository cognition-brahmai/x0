This method returns the index of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. Here's how you can use it to find the index of the first value that is divisible by 5:\n\n```javascript\nconst array = [3, 7, 10, 14, 25, 30];\n\nconst index = array.findIndex(element => element % 5 === 0);\n\nconsole.log(index); // This will output 2, since 10 is the first number divisible by 5.\n```\n\nIn this example, the `findIndex()` method iterates over the array and applies the function `element % 5 === 0` to each element. It returns the index of the first element for which the function returns `true`. If no such element is found, it returns `-1`."
