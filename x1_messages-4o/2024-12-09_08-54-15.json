        "content": "When storing user information such as usernames and passwords in a database, it is important to prioritize security. Storing passwords in plain text is highly discouraged. Instead, passwords should be hashed and optionally salted before being stored. Here's an example of how you might write a SQL query to insert a new user into a database, assuming you have already hashed the password:\n\nLet's assume you have a table named `users` with columns `id`, `username`, and `password_hash`.\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO users (username, password_hash) VALUES (?, ?);\n```\n\nThis SQL query uses placeholders (`?`) for parameterized queries, which you should use to prevent SQL injection. Here's an example in Python using a library like SQLite or a similar database connector:\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\nimport hashlib\nimport os\n\n# Function to hash a password\ndef hash_password(password):\n    # Generate a random salt\n    salt = os.urandom(16)\n    # Create a password hash using SHA-256 algorithm\n    password_hash = hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac('sha256', password.encode('utf-8'), salt, 100000)\n    # Return the salt and hash concatenated\n    return salt + password_hash\n\n# Sample data\nusername = \"new_user\"\npassword = \"secure_password\"\n\n# Hash the password\npassword_hash = hash_password(password)\n\n# Connect to your database\nconn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')\ncursor = conn.cursor()\n\n# Insert the new user into the users table\ncursor.execute(\"INSERT INTO users (username, password_hash) VALUES (?, ?)\", (username, password_hash))\nconn.commit()\n\n# Close the connection\nconn.close()\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how to securely hash a password before storing it in the database. Note that the `password_hash` column should be large enough to store the salt and hashed password combination. Always ensure you follow best practices for security, including using well-tested libraries for hashing and salting passwords."
