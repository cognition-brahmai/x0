However, since I can't execute or verify live data from the internet, I'll provide a general overview of three lesser-known mobile platforms and their distinguishing features.\n\n### 1. Sailfish OS\n- **Features:**\n  - Developed by Jolla, Sailfish OS is known for its privacy-focused approach and open-source nature.\n  - It supports Android apps through a compatibility layer, allowing users to access a vast library of applications.\n  - The user interface is gesture-based, offering a unique and intuitive navigation experience.\n  - Sailfish OS emphasizes security and independence from major tech ecosystems.\n\n### 2. Ubuntu Touch\n- **Features:**\n  - Developed by the UBports community, Ubuntu Touch is a mobile version of the popular Ubuntu Linux distribution.\n  - It features a convergent interface, meaning the OS can adapt its UI when connected to a larger screen, essentially turning the phone into a desktop computer.\n  - Ubuntu Touch is open-source, offering users control over their software and privacy.\n  - It focuses on community-driven development and has a unique app ecosystem.\n\n### 3. KaiOS\n- **Features:**\n  - Designed for feature phones, KaiOS is based on the Linux kernel and forked from the discontinued Firefox OS.\n  - It brings smartphone-like functionalities to non-touch devices, emphasizing affordability and battery efficiency.\n  - KaiOS supports 4G LTE, GPS, and Wi-Fi, and has a dedicated app store with popular apps like WhatsApp and Facebook.\n  - It's geared towards emerging markets, bridging the digital divide with essential connectivity features.\n\nThese platforms stand out due to their unique approaches to privacy, user interface, compatibility, and market focus, distinguishing them from dominant players like Android and iOS."
