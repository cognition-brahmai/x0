        "content": "To extract the nth digit from a given number in Python, you can indeed convert the number to a string. This is a straightforward method because it allows you to easily access any digit by its index. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef extract_nth_digit(number, n):\n    # Convert the number to a string\n    number_str = str(number)\n    \n    # Get the length of the number\n    length = len(number_str)\n    \n    # Ensure n is within the range\n    if n > length or n < 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"n is out of range\")\n    \n    # Calculate the index (0-based)\n    index = length - n\n    \n    # Return the nth digit\n    return int(number_str[index])\n\n# Example usage\nnumber = 9876543210\nn = 4\ndigit = extract_nth_digit(number, n)\nprint(f\"The {n}th digit is {digit}\")\n```\n\nThis function converts the number to a string and then calculates the index to access the desired digit. Note that the indexing is zero-based, so you need to adjust for that by subtracting `n` from the length of the string to get the correct index. This method is efficient for extracting digits from relatively small numbers."
