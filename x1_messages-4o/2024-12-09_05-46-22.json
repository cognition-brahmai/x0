        "content": "The issue in your code arises because the `add()` method in Python modifies the set in place and returns `None`. Therefore, when you do `a = set().add(1)`, `a` is assigned the value `None`, not the modified set. To fix this, you should first create the set and then call the `add()` method on it separately. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\na = set()  # Create an empty set\na.add(1)   # Add the number 1 to the set\nprint(a)   # This will correctly print the set: {1}\n```\n\nThis way, `a` retains its identity as a set, and you can successfully add elements to it and print the updated set."
