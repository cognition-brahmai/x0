Here's how you can do it with your existing array:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\ndeclare -A array\narray[foo]=bar\narray[bar]=foo\n\n# Iterate over the keys of the associative array\nfor key in \"${!array[@]}\"; do\n    # Retrieve the value corresponding to the key\n    value=${array[$key]}\n    # Print the key and value\n    echo \"Key: $key, Value: $value\"\ndone\n```\n\nIn this loop:\n\n- `${!array[@]}` is used to get all the keys of the associative array.\n- For each key, you can access the corresponding value using `${array[$key]}`.\n- The loop iterates over each key-value pair, and you can perform any operations you need inside the loop."
