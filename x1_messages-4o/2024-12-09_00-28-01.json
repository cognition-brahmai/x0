        "content": "The `neuralnet` package in R does not natively support the ReLU activation function, as it primarily supports the logistic and tanh activation functions. However, you can work around this limitation by creating a custom activation function in R. Unfortunately, the `neuralnet` package does not allow user-defined activation functions directly due to its internal structure. \n\nHowever, you can try a workaround by using another package that supports custom activation functions. One such package is `keras`, which is a high-level neural networks API capable of running on top of TensorFlow. Here's how you can implement a neural network with ReLU activation using `keras`:\n\n1. **Install and load the `keras` package:**\n\n   ```R\n   install.packages(\"keras\")\n   library(keras)\n   ```\n\n2. **Define your model using `keras`:**\n\n   ```R\n   # Assume your data is in a matrix format or can be converted to one\n   X_train <- as.matrix(Z[, 2:10])\n   y_train <- as.matrix(Z[, 1])\n\n   model <- keras_model_sequential() %>%\n     layer_dense(units = 5, activation = \"relu\", input_shape = c(ncol(X_train))) %>%\n     layer_dense(units = 1, activation = \"linear\")\n\n   model %>% compile(\n     optimizer = \"adam\",\n     loss = \"mean_squared_error\"\n   )\n\n   model %>% fit(\n     X_train,\n     y_train,\n     epochs = 100,\n     batch_size = 32,\n     validation_split = 0.2\n   )\n   ```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `layer_dense` is used to add a layer to the model. The `activation = \"relu\"` specifies that you want to use the ReLU activation function.\n- The `compile` function sets up the model with an optimizer and a loss function.\n- The `fit` function is used to train the model on your data.\n\nBy using `keras`, you gain the flexibility to define various architectures and custom activation functions and easily switch to using ReLU."
