I'm currently inserting rows one by one using a for loop like this:\n\n```python\nfor i in [['a','b'],['c','d']]:\n    c.execute(\"insert into T (F1,F2) values (%s, %s)\", (i[0], i[1]))\n```\nI would like to know how to achieve this in a single command or call. The table I'm working with is named 'T' and it has two fields 'F1' and 'F2', where the first item in each inner list maps to 'F1' and the second one maps to 'F2'."

        "content": "To insert multiple rows at once using Python's `MySQLdb` library, you can make use of the `executemany()` method. This method allows you to execute an SQL command against all parameter sequences provided, which is ideal for inserting multiple rows in a single operation. Here is an example of how you can do this with your list of lists:\n\n```python\nimport MySQLdb\n\n# Connect to the database\ndb = MySQLdb.connect(\n    host=\"your_host\",\n    user=\"your_username\",\n    passwd=\"your_password\",\n    db=\"your_database\"\n)\n\n# Prepare a cursor object using cursor() method\ncursor = db.cursor()\n\n# Your data\ndata = [['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd']]\n\n# SQL query to insert data\nquery = \"INSERT INTO T (F1, F2) VALUES (%s, %s)\"\n\n# Use executemany() to insert multiple rows\ncursor.executemany(query, data)\n\n# Commit the transaction\ndb.commit()\n\n# Close the cursor and connection\ncursor.close()\ndb.close()\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `\"your_host\"`, `\"your_username\"`, `\"your_password\"`, and `\"your_database\"` with your actual database connection details.\n\nThis method is efficient because it reduces the overhead of multiple round trips between your application and the database server, which is beneficial for performance, especially when dealing with a large number of rows."
