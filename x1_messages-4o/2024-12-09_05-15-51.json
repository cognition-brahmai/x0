        "content": "I am using Python and trying to connect to a laboratory instrument via telnet. For this, I want to extend the `Telnet` class from the `telnetlib` module in the standard library, to include functions specific to our instrument. Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nimport telnetlib\nclass Instrument(telnetlib.Telnet):\n    def __init__(self, host=None, port=0, timeout=5):\n        super(Instrument,self).__init__(host, port, timeout)\n```\n\nI am inheriting the `__init__` method from the parent class (`telnetlib.Telnet`) and passing on the standard arguments, so I can add more things to `__init__` later. I have used this formula on other occasions and it has worked but this time it is throwing an error at the `super()` statement when I try to instantiate it. The error is `TypeError: must be type, not classobj`. \n\nLooking at the source code for `telnetlib`, I noticed that `Telnet` seems to be an old-style class as it doesn't inherit from `object`. Could this be the source of my problem? If so, how can I fix it? I have seen code examples where the derived class inherits both from the superclass and `object`. Is this a solution to my issue? \n\nI have also tried using `telnetlib.Telnet` in place of `super()`, and `from telnetlib import Telnet` with `Telnet` in place of `super()`. However, the problem still persists. How can I solve this?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is indeed related to the fact that `telnetlib.Telnet` is an old-style class. In Python 2, classes that do not explicitly inherit from `object` are considered old-style. This can cause issues with the `super()` function, which is designed to work with new-style classes (those that derive from `object`).\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can modify your class to explicitly inherit from both `telnetlib.Telnet` and `object`, making it a new-style class. This approach will bypass the limitation of `super()` with old-style classes. Here's an updated version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport telnetlib\n\nclass Instrument(telnetlib.Telnet, object):\n    def __init__(self, host=None, port=0, timeout=5):\n        telnetlib.Telnet.__init__(self, host, port, timeout)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- We are explicitly calling the `__init__` method of `telnetlib.Telnet` instead of using `super()`.\n- By inheriting from both `telnetlib.Telnet` and `object`, you ensure that `Instrument` is treated as a new-style class, which is important for consistent behavior in Python 2.\n\nIf you are working with Python 3, the `super()` function should work out of the box since all classes are new-style by default. However, if you are maintaining compatibility with Python 2, the above approach should resolve your issue.\n\nAdditionally, if you're working exclusively with Python 3, you can use `super()` without any arguments in your code, like this:\n\n```python\nimport telnetlib\n\nclass Instrument(telnetlib.Telnet):\n    def __init__(self, host=None, port=0, timeout=5):\n        super().__init__(host, port, timeout)\n```\n\nThis version works because Python 3's `super()` automatically resolves the method resolution order and doesn't require explicit arguments."
