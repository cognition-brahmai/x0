        "content": "To retrieve a list of all countries that are currently part of the European Union along with their corresponding codes, you can use a Python package like `pycountry`. This package allows you to access a database of countries and their information. Additionally, you can manually maintain a list of EU countries since the package doesn't directly provide a list of EU members.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport pycountry\n\n# List of EU countries' ISO Alpha-2 codes\neu_country_codes = [\n    'AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'HR', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DK', 'EE', 'FI', 'FR', \n    'DE', 'GR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IT', 'LV', 'LT', 'LU', 'MT', 'NL', \n    'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'SK', 'SI', 'ES', 'SE'\n]\n\n# Retrieve the list of EU countries and their codes\neu_countries = [(country.name, country.alpha_2) for country in pycountry.countries if country.alpha_2 in eu_country_codes]\n\n# Print the list of EU countries\nprint(\"EU Countries and their codes:\")\nfor name, code in eu_countries:\n    print(f\"{name}: {code}\")\n\n# Potential candidate countries (this needs to be updated manually as necessary)\npotential_candidate_countries = ['TR', 'RS', 'ME', 'MK', 'AL', 'BA']\n\n# Filter out potential candidate countries\nfiltered_eu_countries = [country for country in eu_countries if country[1] not in potential_candidate_countries]\n\n# Print the filtered list of EU countries\nprint(\"\\nFiltered EU Countries (excluding candidates):\")\nfor name, code in filtered_eu_countries:\n    print(f\"{name}: {code}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **pycountry**: This package is used to access standardized country data, including names and codes.\n2. **eu_country_codes**: A list of ISO Alpha-2 codes for all current EU member states.\n3. **Retrieving EU countries**: We filter `pycountry.countries` to get the names and codes of EU member countries.\n4. **Potential candidate countries**: A list of ISO Alpha-2 codes representing countries that are candidates for EU membership but are not yet official members.\n5. **Filtering**: We exclude potential candidate countries from the list of EU countries.\n\nKeep in mind that the list of EU countries and potential candidates may change over time, so you'll need to update the lists accordingly."
