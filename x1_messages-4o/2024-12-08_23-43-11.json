        "content": "Certainly! Solving the equation \\(5 + 2 \\times 4 - 3\\) involves using the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)). Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Operations**: \n   - Addition: \\(5 +\\)\n   - Multiplication: \\(2 \\times 4\\)\n   - Subtraction: \\(- 3\\)\n\n2. **Perform Multiplication First**: \n   - According to PEMDAS, multiplication comes before addition and subtraction. \n   - Compute \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\).\n   - The equation now becomes: \\(5 + 8 - 3\\).\n\n3. **Perform Addition and Subtraction from Left to Right**:\n   - Next, handle the addition and subtraction in the order they appear from left to right.\n   - First, perform the addition: \\(5 + 8 = 13\\).\n   - Now the equation is: \\(13 - 3\\).\n\n4. **Finally, Perform Subtraction**:\n   - Compute \\(13 - 3 = 10\\).\n\nThus, the final result of the equation \\(5 + 2 \\times 4 - 3\\) is \\(10\\). Each step follows the order of operations to ensure that the calculations are performed correctly."
