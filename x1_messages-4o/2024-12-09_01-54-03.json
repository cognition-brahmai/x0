I want to be able to create a venv with a user-specified version of pip installed initially, rather than first creating one and then upgrading the pip installation from within the environment. By default, it uses a vendored pip distribution which might be out of date or unsuitable for other reasons."

        "content": "To control the version of pip that is used in a newly created virtual environment, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Preinstall a Specific pip Version Globally:**\n   Before creating a virtual environment, you can install a specific version of pip globally using the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m pip install pip==<specific_version>\n   ```\n\n   This approach temporarily sets the desired pip version globally, which will then be used when you create a new virtual environment.\n\n2. **Use `--without-pip` and Install Manually:**\n   You can create a virtual environment without pip and then install the desired pip version manually:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv --without-pip myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `myenv\\Scripts\\activate`\n   curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python - 'pip==<specific_version>'\n   ```\n\n   This method allows you to specify the exact version of pip to install in the virtual environment.\n\n3. **Custom Script for venv Creation:**\n   You can automate the process by writing a custom script that creates the virtual environment and installs the specified version of pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   #!/bin/bash\n\n   ENV_DIR=$1\n   PIP_VERSION=$2\n\n   python -m venv --without-pip $ENV_DIR\n   source $ENV_DIR/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `$ENV_DIR\\Scripts\\activate`\n   curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python - \"pip==$PIP_VERSION\"\n   ```\n\n   Save this script as `create_venv_with_pip.sh`, make it executable, and run it with the environment directory and desired pip version as arguments:\n\n   ```bash\n   ./create_venv_with_pip.sh myenv 21.2.4\n   ```\n\n4. **Modify the `ensurepip` Module:**\n   This is a more advanced and less recommended approach, but you can modify the `ensurepip` module used by Python to bundle a different version of pip. This would require altering the Python standard library, which can be cumbersome and may lead to maintenance issues.\n\nBy using these methods, you can ensure that your newly created virtual environment starts with a specific version of pip, tailored to your requirements."
