However, please be aware that the `googletrans` library might not always be reliable due to potential changes in the API endpoints or rate limiting by Google. \n\nFirst, you'll need to install the `googletrans` library if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1\n```\n\nHere's a Python function that uses `googletrans` to translate an English sentence to Spanish:\n\n```python\nfrom googletrans import Translator\n\ndef translate_to_spanish(sentence):\n    # Initialize the Translator\n    translator = Translator()\n    \n    # Translate the sentence to Spanish\n    translation = translator.translate(sentence, src='en', dest='es')\n    \n    # Return the translated text\n    return translation.text\n\n# Example usage\nenglish_sentence = \"The man drove the car to the store\"\nspanish_translation = translate_to_spanish(english_sentence)\nprint(spanish_translation)\n```\n\nThis code initializes a `Translator` object and uses it to translate the given English sentence to Spanish. The `src` parameter specifies the source language (English), and the `dest` parameter specifies the destination language (Spanish). The function then returns the translated text. \n\nPlease note that usage of this library should comply with Google's terms of service."
