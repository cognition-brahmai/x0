Is there a more efficient or shorter way to increment a value for a key in a dictionary without needing to check for its existence first?

        "content": "Yes, there is a more efficient and Pythonic way to achieve this using the `dict.get()` method or the `collections.defaultdict` class.\n\n1. **Using `dict.get()`**:\n\n   You can use the `get()` method of dictionaries to simplify the process. The `get()` method returns the value for the specified key if the key is in the dictionary, otherwise, it returns a default value (which you can specify).\n\n   ```python\n   my_dict[key] = my_dict.get(key, 0) + num\n   ```\n\n   This line of code retrieves the current value associated with `key` if it exists; otherwise, it defaults to `0`. Then, it adds `num` to this value.\n\n2. **Using `collections.defaultdict`**:\n\n   You can also use `collections.defaultdict` to automatically handle missing keys by initializing them with a default value.\n\n   ```python\n   from collections import defaultdict\n\n   my_dict = defaultdict(int)  # Default value for missing keys is 0\n   my_dict[key] += num\n   ```\n\n   With `defaultdict`, you don't need to check if the key exists; it will automatically initialize any missing key with the specified default value (in this case, `0` for integers) and then perform the increment operation.\n\nBoth methods help streamline your code and avoid repetitive checks for the existence of keys in the dictionary."
