Polarity ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a very negative sentiment, 0 is neutral, and 1 is very positive. A score of -0.4 suggests that the sentiment is somewhat negative.\n\n- **Subjectivity**: This score is 0.7. Subjectivity ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 is very objective (fact-based) and 1 is very subjective (opinion-based). A score of 0.7 indicates that the statement is fairly subjective, meaning it expresses personal feelings or opinions rather than objective facts."
