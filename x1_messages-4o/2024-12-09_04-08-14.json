Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Assume r and c are the dimensions of the array\nr, c = 3, 3  # Example dimensions\ncells = np.empty((r, c), dtype=np.object)\n\n# Iterate over the array using numpy.nditer\nfor element in np.nditer(cells, flags=['refs_ok']):\n    print(element)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `np.nditer` is used to iterate over each element of the array, regardless of the order.\n- The `flags=['refs_ok']` flag is used because the elements are of `dtype=np.object`, and this allows `nditer` to handle object references correctly.\n\nThis method is efficient and works well for iterating over arrays without concerning about the order of elements."
