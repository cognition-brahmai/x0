        "content": "The issue you're encountering is a common one when dealing with relationships in databases. When you create a `Parent` object and add it to the session, its `id` is not immediately available because it hasn't been committed to the database yet. This can be resolved by using SQLAlchemy's support for relationships and by managing your session more effectively. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n1. Define a relationship between `Parent` and `Child`.\n2. Add the `Parent` to the session and commit it to get the ID.\n3. Use the relationship to associate the `Child` with the `Parent`.\n\nHere's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import relationship\n\nclass Parent(db.Model):\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n    children = relationship('Child', backref='parent', lazy=True)\n\nclass Child(db.Model):\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n    parent_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('parent.id'))\n\n# Create a new parent object\nparent = Parent()\n\n# Add the parent to the session and commit it to generate an ID\ndb.session.add(parent)\ndb.session.commit()\n\n# Now create a child object and associate it with the parent\nchild = Child(parent_id=parent.id)\n\n# Alternatively, you can use the relationship to associate the child\n# child = Child(parent=parent)\n\n# Add the child to the session\ndb.session.add(child)\n\n# Commit the session to save the child\ndb.session.commit()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Relationship Definition**: By defining a relationship using `relationship()`, you can directly establish a connection between `Parent` and `Child`.\n\n2. **Commit Parent First**: You add the `Parent` to the session and commit it before creating the `Child`. This ensures that the `parent.id` is populated with the correct value from the database.\n\n3. **Use the Relationship**: You can directly create a `Child` by associating it with the `Parent` using `child = Child(parent=parent)`, which automatically takes care of setting the `parent_id`.\n\nBy following these steps, you ensure that the `parent_id` is correctly populated when you create and commit the `Child` object."
