I have saved the names of the columns I want to select in a Python list and intend to filter my dataframe using this list. I tried using the code:\n\n```python\ndf_new = df[[list]]\n```\nwhere `list` includes all the column names that I want to select. However, this returns an error:\n\n```python\nTypeError: unhashable type: 'list'\n```\nCan someone help me understand how to correctly select columns using a list of column names?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is because you're using `list` in double square brackets, which Pandas interprets incorrectly in this context. Instead, you should pass the actual list variable that contains your column names directly to the DataFrame indexing. Here's how you can do it correctly:\n\nSuppose you have a list of column names you want to select:\n\n```python\ncolumns_to_select = ['column1', 'column2', 'column3']\n```\n\nYou should use this list to select the columns from your DataFrame like this:\n\n```python\ndf_new = df[columns_to_select]\n```\n\nThis will create a new DataFrame `df_new` that contains only the columns specified in `columns_to_select`. Make sure that the variable `columns_to_select` is not named `list`, as `list` is a built-in Python type and using it as a variable name can lead to confusion and errors."
