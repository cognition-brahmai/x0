Here's a sample query you could use:\n\n```plaintext\n\"history of Ancient Greece\" OR \"Ancient Greek history\" OR \"Greece history\" OR \"Greece civilization\" AND \"books\" -fiction\n```\n\nThis query uses quotation marks to search for the exact phrases, the OR operator to include different variations, and excludes fiction books by using the `-fiction` modifier. You can adjust the query based on the platform's search capabilities and filters."
