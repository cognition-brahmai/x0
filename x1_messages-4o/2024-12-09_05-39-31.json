This comment can be placed at the top of the file to disable the error for the entire file, or it can be placed at the end of a specific line to disable the error for that particular line. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. To disable the error for the entire file, add the following comment at the top of your file:\n\n   ```python\n   # noqa: E223\n   ```\n\n2. To disable the error for a specific line, add the comment at the end of the line:\n\n   ```python\n   some_code_here  # noqa: E223\n   ```\n\nIf you are using `flake8` as your linter, make sure that the `noqa` comments are being picked up correctly. If they aren't, ensure that your `flake8` configuration is set up properly and that there are no other configuration files that might be overriding this setting."
