I am aware of the 'order' attribute in seaborn.countplot, but I am looking for an inbuilt functionality in seaborn.countplot to achieve this. Is it possible to do this without manually computing the count using a 'groupby' operation on the original dataframe?"

However, you can achieve this by utilizing Pandas to pre-process the data and then passing the ordered categories to the `order` parameter in `countplot`.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Use Pandas to compute the counts for each category.\n2. Sort the categories based on the count in descending order.\n3. Pass the ordered categories to the `order` parameter of `countplot`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step example:\n\n```python\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Sample data\ndata = {'category': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Compute the counts and order categories by descending count\ncategory_order = df['category'].value_counts().index\n\n# Create the countplot\nsns.countplot(data=df, x='category', order=category_order)\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this example, `value_counts()` computes the count of each category, and `index` retrieves the categories sorted by their count in descending order. This ordered list is then used in the `order` parameter of `countplot`. This approach efficiently orders the categories without manually performing a `groupby` operation."
