I conducted an experiment where I set two variables to the same integer and checked if they were the same object. The results were different when the integers were less or equal to 256, and when they were greater than 256. Moreover, I found that the results also varied when I ran the code in a Python file versus when I ran them in the Python shell. After digging into Python's source code, I found that two different `PyInt_Object`s are created during the `cst` to `ast` transform, but they are later merged. Can anyone help me understand why this happens and how Python's integer cache works?"

        "content": "Python's integer caching mechanism is an optimization strategy used by the Python interpreter to improve performance and memory efficiency when dealing with integer objects. Here's a detailed explanation of how it works and why you observed different behaviors:\n\n### Integer Caching in Python\n\n1. **Small Integers Caching**: Python automatically caches small integer objects in a range of -5 to 256. This means that any time you create an integer within this range, Python doesn't create a new object; instead, it uses an existing object from the cache. This is why, when you set two variables to the same integer within this range, they are actually the same object (i.e., they have the same memory address).\n\n   ```python\n   a = 256\n   b = 256\n   print(a is b)  # Outputs: True\n   ```\n\n2. **Larger Integers**: For integers outside this range, Python creates a new integer object each time, hence they do not share the same memory location. This is why, when you set two variables to the same integer greater than 256, they are not the same object.\n\n   ```python\n   a = 257\n   b = 257\n   print(a is b)  # Outputs: False\n   ```\n\n### Behavior Differences in Python Shell vs. Python File\n\n- **Interactive Shell (REPL)**: When you run code in the interactive shell, Python sometimes optimizes further by reusing integer objects more aggressively. This can lead to objects appearing to be the same when they are not within the cached range.\n\n- **Python Scripts**: In a script, the code is compiled and executed as a whole, which can change how and when objects are created and optimized. This can result in different behaviors compared to the interactive shell because the interpreter might not apply the same optimizations.\n\n### PyInt_Object and AST Transformation\n\nWhen you write code, it is first parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) before being compiled to bytecode. During this transformation, constants (like integers) are represented as `PyInt_Object`s. In the case of small integers, the Python interpreter merges these objects to use the cached versions, reducing memory usage. For larger integers, new objects are created unless specific optimizations are in place.\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Integer Caching Range**: -5 to 256, for which Python reuses objects.\n- **Different Behavior**: Results differ in interactive vs. script due to different optimization strategies.\n- **AST and Compilation**: The transformation and optimization phases can affect how integer objects are handled.\n\nUnderstanding these nuances helps explain the behavior you observed during your experiments."
