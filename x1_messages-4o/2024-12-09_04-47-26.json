        "content": "How can I make scatterplots in Matplotlib transparent as a group? I'm using Python 3.4.0, matplotlib 1.4.3, on a Linux Mint 17 system. I can set alpha transparency for each point individually, but how can I set them as a group, so that two overlapping points from the same group don't change the color? Below is my current code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef points(n=100):\n    x = np.random.uniform(size=n)\n    y = np.random.uniform(size=n)\n    return x, y\nx1, y1 = points()\nx2, y2 = points()\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(4,4))\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, title=\"Test scatter\")\nax.scatter(x1, y1, s=100, color=\"blue\", alpha=0.5)\nax.scatter(x2, y2, s=100, color=\"red\", alpha=0.5)\nfig.savefig(\"test_scatter.png\")\n```\n\nThis results in an output where overlapping points from the same group change the color. I can manually group and set transparency in Inkscape after saving as SVG, but I'm looking for a way to do this directly in the code. Any suggestions?"

        "content": "To achieve the effect you're looking for, where overlapping points within the same group don't change the color intensity, you can use a combination of lower alpha values and a higher z-order for plotting. However, Matplotlib doesn't directly support grouping in a way that prevents overlapping colors from becoming darker. Instead, you can use a workaround by adjusting the transparency and plotting order.\n\nHere's an approach to handle this:\n\n1. Use the `zorder` parameter to layer the plots appropriately.\n2. Adjust the `alpha` value to be low enough to minimize the effect of overlapping colors within the same group.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef points(n=100):\n    x = np.random.uniform(size=n)\n    y = np.random.uniform(size=n)\n    return x, y\n\nx1, y1 = points()\nx2, y2 = points()\n\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(4,4))\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, title=\"Test scatter\")\n\n# Plot the first group with lower alpha and a higher zorder\nax.scatter(x1, y1, s=100, color=\"blue\", alpha=0.3, zorder=2)\n\n# Plot the second group with lower alpha and a higher zorder\nax.scatter(x2, y2, s=100, color=\"red\", alpha=0.3, zorder=1)\n\nfig.savefig(\"test_scatter.png\")\n```\n\nIn this setup:\n- The `alpha` is set to 0.3, making each point more transparent, which helps to reduce the effect of overlapping points intensifying the color.\n- The `zorder` parameter ensures that one group is plotted over the other, which helps in maintaining visual clarity.\n\nThis method does not completely eliminate the darkening of overlapping points within the same group, but it minimizes the effect by reducing the opacity and controlling the order of plotting. If you require more advanced control over transparency effects, consider using additional visualization libraries such as `seaborn` or `plotly` which might offer more sophisticated layering techniques."
