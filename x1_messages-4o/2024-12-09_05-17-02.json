However, when I try to implement this, I receive an error saying \"global name 'question_votes' is not defined\". How can I correctly use this function to annotate my QuerySet?\n\nHere's the function I'm using:\n\n```python\ndef hot(ups, downs, date):\n    # Do something here..\n    return hotness\n```\nThe relevant parts of my question and vote models are as follows:\n```python\nclass Question(models.Model):\n    title = models.CharField(max_length=150)\n    body = models.TextField()\n    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)\n\nclass Vote(models.Model):\n    question = models.ForeignKey(Question, related_name='questions_votes')\n    delta = models.IntegerField(default=0)\n```\nThe `delta` attribute is either positive or negative. The hot function receives the number of positive votes, the number of negative votes, and the creation date of the question. I've tried to annotate my QuerySet like this, but it isn't working:\n```python\nquestions = Question.objects.annotate(hotness=hot(question_votes.filter(delta, > 0),question_votes.filter(delta < 0), 'created_at')).order_by('hotness')\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the `question_votes` variable is not defined in your `annotate` call. You need to aggregate the votes for each question and then pass those aggregates to your `hot` function. Here's how you can approach this:\n\nFirst, you need to aggregate the votes for each question. You can do this using Django's `annotate` and `Sum` functionality, which will help you to calculate the number of positive and negative votes for each question. Then, you can use a custom function to calculate the hotness.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n1. Import the necessary functions from Django:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db.models import Sum, F, ExpressionWrapper, fields\nfrom django.utils import timezone\n```\n\n2. Modify your `hot` function to work with Django's `annotate`. Since you can't directly use Python functions in Django's QuerySet annotations, you need to use an `ExpressionWrapper` to handle calculations directly in the database. Here's an example of how you can structure it:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_hotness(ups, downs, age_in_seconds):\n    # Example calculation; you can replace it with your actual hotness formula\n    return ups - downs + age_in_seconds * 0.001\n```\n\n3. Annotate your `QuerySet` with the number of upvotes and downvotes, and calculate the hotness:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db.models import Count\nfrom django.db.models.functions import Now\n\nquestions = Question.objects.annotate(\n    upvotes=Count('questions_votes', filter=F('questions_votes__delta__gt=0')),\n    downvotes=Count('questions_votes', filter=F('questions_votes__delta__lt=0')),\n    age_in_seconds=ExpressionWrapper(\n        (Now() - F('created_at')).total_seconds(),\n        output_field=fields.FloatField()\n    )\n).annotate(\n    hotness=ExpressionWrapper(\n        calculate_hotness(F('upvotes'), F('downvotes'), F('age_in_seconds')),\n        output_field=fields.FloatField()\n    )\n).order_by('-hotness')\n```\n\nIn this setup:\n\n- `upvotes` and `downvotes` are calculated using `Count` and filtering based on the `delta` value.\n- `age_in_seconds` calculates the age of the question in seconds.\n- `hotness` is calculated using an `ExpressionWrapper` to apply the `calculate_hotness` function.\n\nYou can replace the `calculate_hotness` function with your actual logic for determining hotness. This should help you resolve the error and correctly annotate your QuerySet with the calculated hotness."
