        "content": "To address the problem of a traveler trying to get from point A to point B with three layovers, we can develop a simple program that simulates the travel itinerary. This program will allow the user to input details about each leg of their journey, including the starting point, layovers, and the final destination. The program will then output a structured itinerary.\n\nBelow is a Python program that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef get_travel_plan():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Travel Itinerary Planner!\")\n    \n    # Get the starting point\n    start_point = input(\"Enter the starting point (Point A): \")\n\n    # Initialize a list to hold the layovers\n    layovers = []\n\n    # Get details for the three layovers\n    for i in range(1, 4):\n        layover = input(f\"Enter layover {i} location: \")\n        layovers.append(layover)\n\n    # Get the final destination\n    final_destination = input(\"Enter the final destination (Point B): \")\n\n    # Create and display the itinerary\n    itinerary = [start_point] + layovers + [final_destination]\n    print(\"\\nYour travel itinerary is as follows:\")\n    for i, location in enumerate(itinerary):\n        if i == 0:\n            print(f\"Start at: {location}\")\n        elif i == len(itinerary) - 1:\n            print(f\"Final Destination: {location}\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Layover {i}: {location}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nSafe travels!\")\n\n# Run the travel planner\nget_travel_plan()\n```\n\n### Program Explanation\n\n1. **Input Gathering**: \n   - The program begins by welcoming the user to the Travel Itinerary Planner.\n   - It then prompts the user to enter the starting point (Point A).\n   - The user is asked to input three layover locations, which are stored in a list named `layovers`.\n\n2. **Final Destination**:\n   - The user is prompted to enter the final destination (Point B).\n\n3. **Itinerary Construction**:\n   - The program constructs the itinerary by concatenating the starting point, layover locations, and final destination into a single list named `itinerary`.\n\n4. **Output**:\n   - The program iterates through the `itinerary` list, displaying each segment of the journey in a structured format.\n   - It identifies the starting point, each layover, and the final destination.\n\n5. **User Interaction**:\n   - The program runs interactively, allowing the user to input their journey details and receive a formatted itinerary as output.\n\nThis program provides a basic structure for planning a trip with multiple layovers, and it can be expanded with additional features such as time management, transportation methods, or accommodation details."
