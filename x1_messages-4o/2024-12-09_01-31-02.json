I want to remove all rows from df1 where df1.userid equals df2.userid and df1.group equals df2.group. I have tried using join() and filter() functions, but these seem to be adding additional rows instead of deleting them. I am using Python 2.7 and Spark 2.1.0."

        "content": "To filter a PySpark DataFrame (`df1`) based on the columns of another DataFrame (`df2`), and specifically to remove rows from `df1` where `df1.userid` equals `df2.userid` and `df1.group` equals `df2.group`, you can perform an anti join. An anti join will return only the rows from `df1` that do not have a match in `df2`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\n# Assuming you have a Spark session already created\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"FilterDataFrame\").getOrCreate()\n\n# Assuming df1 and df2 are already created DataFrames\n\n# Perform an anti join to filter out the rows from df1 that match with df2\nfiltered_df = df1.join(df2, (df1.userid == df2.userid) & (df1.group == df2.group), \"left_anti\")\n\n# Show the result\nfiltered_df.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Join Type `left_anti`:** This type of join returns only the rows from the left DataFrame (`df1`) that do not have any matching rows in the right DataFrame (`df2`) based on the specified conditions.\n- **Conditions:** You specify the join conditions using `(df1.userid == df2.userid) & (df1.group == df2.group)`, which means you're looking for rows where both `userid` and `group` match in both DataFrames.\n\nBy using `left_anti`, you effectively filter out all rows from `df1` where there is a corresponding row in `df2` with the same `userid` and `group`. This is typically more efficient and straightforward than using `filter()` in this context."
