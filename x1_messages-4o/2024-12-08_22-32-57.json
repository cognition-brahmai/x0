Remote work allows employees to manage their schedules more effectively, balancing personal and professional responsibilities. This flexibility can lead to improved work-life balance, as individuals have the ability to work during their most productive hours and attend to personal commitments more easily. Additionally, it can reduce the stress and time associated with commuting, leading to increased job satisfaction and overall well-being."
