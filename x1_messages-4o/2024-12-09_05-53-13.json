This option will collect and display all the test functions it finds without actually running them. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```bash\npytest --collect-only\n```\n\nThis command will give you an output of all the test nodes, including test functions, classes, and modules. If you want to filter this list by a specific pattern, you can combine it with the `-k` option:\n\n```bash\npytest --collect-only -k PATTERN\n```\n\nReplace `PATTERN` with the pattern you want to match. This will list only those tests that match the given pattern.\n\nThis method allows you to see all the tests that are available to run in your suite and helps you verify which tests match a particular pattern without executing them."
