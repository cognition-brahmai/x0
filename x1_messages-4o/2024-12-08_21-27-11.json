Each term in the sequence is described by the previous term. To arrive at the answer, carefully analyze the description of each term with multiple-step reasoning. The next term is a mystery, waiting to be revealed. Are you up for the challenge?"

To determine each subsequent term, you describe the digits of the previous term.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the sequence:\n\n1. **1** is read as \"one 1\" (which is 11).\n2. **11** is read as \"two 1s\" (which is 21).\n3. **21** is read as \"one 2, then one 1\" (which is 1211).\n4. **1211** is read as \"one 1, one 2, two 1s\" (which is 111221).\n5. **111221** is read as \"three 1s, two 2s, one 1\" (which is 312211).\n\nNow, let's determine the next term:\n\n6. **312211** is read as \"one 3, one 1, two 2s, two 1s\" (which is 13112221).\n\nSo, the next term in the sequence is **13112221**."
