Currently, my program accepts user input for their age and then determines whether they can vote in the United States. However, if the user enters an invalid input (like a non-numeric value or negative number), the program crashes or accepts the invalid value. How can I handle this?\n\nBelow is my current code:\n```python\n#note: Python 2.7 users should use `raw_input`, the equivalent of 3.X's `input`\nage = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\nif age >= 18: \n    print(\"You are able to vote in the United States!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"You are not able to vote in the United States.\")\n```\nFor example, if the user enters \"23\", the program prints \"You are able to vote in the United States!\". However, if the user enters \"dickety six\", it throws a ValueError:\n```python\nPlease enter your age: dickety six\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"canyouvote.py\", line 1, in <module>\n    age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\nValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'dickety six'\n```"

        "content": "To modify your Python program so that it continues to prompt the user for input until it receives a valid response, you can use a loop along with exception handling. This will allow you to catch errors and prompt the user again without crashing the program. Here's a modified version of your code that includes these enhancements:\n\n```python\nwhile True:\n    try:\n        age = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\n        if age < 0:\n            print(\"Age cannot be negative. Please try again.\")\n            continue\n        break  # Exit the loop if the input is valid and non-negative\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a numeric value.\")\n\nif age >= 18:\n    print(\"You are able to vote in the United States!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"You are not able to vote in the United States.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Loop**: We use a `while True` loop to keep asking the user for input until a valid input is received.\n\n2. **Try-Except Block**: We wrap the input and conversion to an integer in a `try` block to catch `ValueError` exceptions. If a `ValueError` is raised (e.g., if the user inputs a non-numeric value), the `except` block will handle it by printing an error message and continuing the loop.\n\n3. **Negative Age Check**: After successfully converting the input to an integer, we check if the age is negative. If it is, we print an error message and continue to prompt the user.\n\n4. **Break Statement**: If the input is valid and non-negative, we use `break` to exit the loop and proceed with the rest of the program.\n\nThis approach ensures that the user is continuously prompted until they enter a valid, non-negative integer for their age."
