        "content": "Certainly! To include the year when each category was first recognized as a significant aspect of software engineering in your Excel table, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Categories**: List all categories in your Excel table. These could be aspects such as \"Version Control,\" \"Testing,\" \"Agile Methodologies,\" etc.\n\n2. **Research**: For each category, research the year when it was first recognized or became significant in the field of software engineering. This might involve looking into historical documents, academic papers, or reputable sources online.\n\n3. **Add a Column**: In your Excel table, add a new column titled \"Year Recognized.\"\n\n4. **Enter Data**: For each category, enter the corresponding year in the \"Year Recognized\" column.\n\nHere's a simple example of how your table might look:\n\n| Category            | Year Recognized |\n|---------------------|-----------------|\n| Version Control     | 1972            |\n| Agile Methodologies | 2001            |\n| Testing             | 1960            |\n\n5. **Verify**: Double-check the years to ensure accuracy, as the significance of categories can sometimes be subjective or vary based on different sources.\n\nBy adding this column, you'll have a comprehensive table that not only lists the categories but also provides historical context for when they became crucial in software engineering."
