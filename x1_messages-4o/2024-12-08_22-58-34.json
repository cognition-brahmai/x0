        "content": "To determine the shortest distance between any two trees while adhering to the constraint that no tree is closer than 5 meters to any edge of the rectangular garden, we need to consider a few factors.\n\n1. **Garden Dimensions**: Let's assume the dimensions of the rectangular garden are \\( L \\) meters in length and \\( W \\) meters in width.\n\n2. **Effective Planting Area**: Because no tree can be closer than 5 meters to any edge, the effective planting area is reduced. This means the effective dimensions of the area where you can plant trees are \\( (L - 10) \\) meters by \\( (W - 10) \\) meters. This is because you need to maintain a 5-meter margin on all sides.\n\n3. **Placement of Trees**: Trees should be placed within this effective area such that they are not closer than a certain distance to each other.\n\n4. **Shortest Distance Calculation**: The shortest distance between any two trees will depend on how many trees are planted and their arrangement. If you arrange the trees in a grid pattern within the effective planting area, the shortest distance between any two trees will be determined by the grid spacing.\n\n   - **Grid Arrangement**: If you plant the trees in rows and columns, the distance \\( d \\) between adjacent trees (in any direction) should be maximized to fit the maximum number of trees while maintaining the desired spacing.\n   - The distance \\( d \\) is constrained by the dimensions of the effective area and the number of trees in each row and column.\n\n5. **Example Calculation**:\n   - Let's assume you want to plant \\( n \\) rows and \\( m \\) columns of trees. The distance \\( d \\) between trees in a row is \\( (L - 10)/(m - 1) \\), and the distance between trees in a column is \\( (W - 10)/(n - 1) \\).\n   - The shortest distance will be the smaller of these two values.\n\nBy ensuring that the trees are placed within this effective area and considering the desired number of trees, you can determine the shortest distance between any two trees. This distance will ensure that the trees are planted optimally while adhering to the 5-meter edge constraint."
