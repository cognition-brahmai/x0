For example, I have the following dataframe:\n\n```\nA | B | C | D\nJohn Doe | 45 | True | False\nJane Smith | 32 | False | False\nAlan Holmes | 55 | False | True\nEric Lamar | 29 | True | True\n```\nThe dtype for columns C and D is Boolean. I want to filter this dataframe to create a new one (df1) with only the rows where either C or D is True. The expected output is:\n\n```\nA | B | C | D\nJohn Doe | 45 | True | False\nAlan Holmes | 55 | False | True\nEric Lamar | 29 | True | True\n```\nI tried to do this using the following code, but it's not working because it can't handle the Boolean type:\n\n```\ndf1 = df[(df['C']=='True') or (df['D']=='True')]\n```\nWhat would be the correct way to do this?"

        "content": "To filter a pandas DataFrame using multiple Boolean conditions, you need to use the bitwise operators `|` for \"or\" and `&` for \"and\", along with parentheses to ensure the correct precedence. Additionally, you should compare Boolean columns directly without quotes around `True` or `False`, as they are already Boolean values.\n\nHere is the correct way to filter the DataFrame based on your conditions:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'A': ['John Doe', 'Jane Smith', 'Alan Holmes', 'Eric Lamar'],\n    'B': [45, 32, 55, 29],\n    'C': [True, False, False, True],\n    'D': [False, False, True, True]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Filter the DataFrame\ndf1 = df[(df['C'] == True) | (df['D'] == True)]\n\nprint(df1)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- `df['C'] == True` checks if the value in column `C` is `True`.\n- `df['D'] == True` checks if the value in column `D` is `True`.\n- The `|` operator is used to combine these two conditions to filter rows where either condition is met.\n\nWhen you run this code, `df1` will contain only the rows where either column `C` or column `D` is `True`, which matches your expected output."
