The first half should be stored in a variable called \"firstHalf\", and the second half should be stored in a variable called \"secondHalf\".\nWhat Scala code can I use to achieve this?"

        "content": "To accomplish this task, you can use Scala to find the position of the specific word and then split the sentence into two halves based on that position. Here's a simple example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```scala\nobject SentenceSplitter extends App {\n  // The sentence you want to split\n  val sentence = \"Scala has revolutionized the way we write code and build applications.\"\n\n  // The word to split the sentence on\n  val wordToSplit = \"revolutionized\"\n\n  // Finding the index of the word in the sentence\n  val indexOfWord = sentence.indexOf(wordToSplit)\n\n  if (indexOfWord != -1) {\n    // Splitting the sentence into two halves\n    val firstHalf = sentence.substring(0, indexOfWord + wordToSplit.length).trim\n    val secondHalf = sentence.substring(indexOfWord + wordToSplit.length).trim\n\n    // Printing the results\n    println(s\"First Half: $firstHalf\")\n    println(s\"Second Half: $secondHalf\")\n  } else {\n    println(s\"The word '$wordToSplit' was not found in the sentence.\")\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We define a string `sentence` which contains the sentence you want to split.\n- `wordToSplit` is the word based on which you want to divide the sentence.\n- `indexOfWord` is used to find the position of `wordToSplit` in the sentence.\n- If the word is found (`indexOfWord != -1`), we use the `substring` method to split the sentence into two parts:\n  - `firstHalf` contains the part of the sentence from the beginning up to and including the specified word.\n  - `secondHalf` contains the part of the sentence after the specified word.\n- We trim any extra spaces from both halves and print the results.\n\nYou can modify the `sentence` and `wordToSplit` variables to fit your specific use case."
