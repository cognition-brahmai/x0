I want to obtain the same result that I would have gotten with the command line. For instance, if I run the command 'mysqladmin create test -uroot -pmysqladmin12', the function should return an output similar to 'mysqladmin: CREATE DATABASE failed; error: 'Can't create database 'test'; database exists'."

        "content": "To execute a shell command in Python and capture its output, including both standard output and error messages, you can use the `subprocess` module. The `subprocess.run()` function is particularly useful for this task because it provides a straightforward way to execute a command and get its results.\n\nHere is a function that executes a shell command and returns its output as a string:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\ndef execute_shell_command(command):\n    try:\n        # Run the command with subprocess.run\n        result = subprocess.run(command, shell=True, check=True, text=True, capture_output=True)\n        # Return the standard output\n        return result.stdout\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:\n        # If an error occurs, return the error output\n        return e.stderr\n\n# Example usage\ncommand = \"mysqladmin create test -uroot -pmysqladmin12\"\noutput = execute_shell_command(command)\nprint(output)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **subprocess.run**: This function is used to run the command. It takes several arguments:\n  - `command`: The command string you want to execute.\n  - `shell=True`: This allows the command to be executed through the shell.\n  - `check=True`: This raises a `CalledProcessError` if the command exits with a non-zero status.\n  - `text=True`: This ensures that the output is returned as a string instead of bytes.\n  - `capture_output=True`: This captures both standard output and standard error.\n\n- **Try-Except Block**: The `try` block captures the standard output if the command is successful. If the command fails (returns a non-zero exit status), the `except` block captures the error output.\n\nThis function will return the command's output or error message as a string, similar to what you would see in the command line."
