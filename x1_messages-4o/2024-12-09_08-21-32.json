I have Mercurial and Git installed, as well as Python 2.5 (32-bit). When I initially tried to install the extension following the instructions on http://hg-git.github.com/, easy_install failed as it was unable to compile dulwich without Visual Studio 2003. I have manually installed dulwich and easy_install hg-git succeeds now, but when I run 'hg', I get an error message that says, \"failed to import extension hggit: No module named hggit\". I have also tried the \"more involved\" instructions from the hg-git page but I am still facing an issue. Can you help me resolve this?"

        "content": "To get the hg-git Mercurial extension working on Windows, you need to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and configured. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify Python Installation**:\n   - Ensure you have Python 2.5 installed correctly. However, I recommend upgrading to at least Python 2.7 if possible, as Python 2.5 is quite outdated and might not be compatible with newer packages.\n\n2. **Install Mercurial**:\n   - Make sure you have the latest compatible version of Mercurial installed. You can download it from [Mercurial's official website](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/).\n\n3. **Install Git**:\n   - Ensure Git is installed and accessible from the command line. You can download it from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/).\n\n4. **Install setuptools**:\n   - Make sure `setuptools` is installed. You can install it using:\n     ```bash\n     easy_install setuptools\n     ```\n\n5. **Install Dulwich**:\n   - Since you faced issues with `easy_install`, try using `pip` to install dulwich. If you don't have `pip`, you can install it by downloading `get-pip.py` and running:\n     ```bash\n     python get-pip.py\n     ```\n   - Then, install dulwich using:\n     ```bash\n     pip install dulwich\n     ```\n\n6. **Install hg-git**:\n   - Use `pip` to install hg-git as well:\n     ```bash\n     pip install hg-git\n     ```\n\n7. **Configure Mercurial**:\n   - Open your Mercurial configuration file, usually located at `%USERPROFILE%\\Mercurial.ini` or `%HOMEPATH%\\.hgrc`.\n   - Add the following lines to enable the hg-git extension:\n     ```ini\n     [extensions]\n     hggit =\n     ```\n\n8. **Verify Installation**:\n   - Run `hg` in your command line to check if the extension is correctly loaded. If you still face the \"No module named hggit\" error, ensure that Python can locate the installed packages. This might involve checking your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.\n\n9. **Check for Compatibility**:\n   - If you are still encountering issues, verify that you are using compatible versions of Python, Mercurial, Git, and the hg-git extension. Sometimes version mismatches can cause such errors.\n\nIf you continue to have problems, consider using a virtual environment to manage dependencies, which can help isolate the environment and avoid conflicts. You can set up a virtual environment using `virtualenv`:\n\n```bash\npip install virtualenv\nvirtualenv myenv\nmyenv\\Scripts\\activate\n```\n\nAfter activating the virtual environment, reinstall the necessary packages within it. This can often resolve issues related to conflicting Python packages."
