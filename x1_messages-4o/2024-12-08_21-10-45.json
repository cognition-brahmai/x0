Let's arrange them:\n\n1, 4, 5, 7, 8\n\nThe median is the middle value of the ordered set. Since there are five numbers, the third number in this ordered list is the median. Therefore, the median is 5. This is the value that divides the set into two equal parts with two smaller and two larger values."
