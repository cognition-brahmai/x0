I tried running `pip install dotenv` and `python -m pip install dotenv` but neither of them work. I'm getting an error that says \"AttributeError: module 'importlib._bootstrap' has no attribute 'SourceFileLoader'. Command \"python setup.py egg_info\" failed with error code 1 in C:\\Users\\USER~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\pip-build-7bbdcnx2\\dotenv\". I have also tried to upgrade setuptools with `python -m pip install setuptools --upgrade`, uninstalled and reinstalled setuptools, and restarted my computer. I've installed flask before this and it worked, and I can install other things like mitmproxy. What else can I try to install dotenv?"

        "content": "It looks like you're encountering an issue with the installation of the `dotenv` package, which might be due to a compatibility or dependency problem. Here's a step-by-step guide you can follow to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Virtual Environment is Activated**: Double-check that your virtual environment is activated. You should see the environment name in your command prompt. If it's not activated, navigate to your project directory and activate it:\n\n    ```bash\n    # On Windows\n    .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate\n    ```\n\n2. **Install `python-dotenv` Instead**: The package you might be looking for is `python-dotenv`, not `dotenv`. Try installing it using:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install python-dotenv\n    ```\n\n3. **Check Python Version Compatibility**: Since you're using Python 3.6.4, ensure that `python-dotenv` supports this Python version. It generally does, but it's good to verify by checking the [official documentation](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/).\n\n4. **Clear Pip Cache**: Sometimes, cached files can lead to issues. Clear the pip cache and try installing again:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip cache purge\n    pip install python-dotenv\n    ```\n\n5. **Upgrade Pip and Wheel**: Ensure you have the latest versions of pip and wheel:\n\n    ```bash\n    python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel\n    ```\n\n6. **Verify setuptools Version**: After upgrading setuptools, verify its version to ensure it's updated:\n\n    ```bash\n    python -m pip show setuptools\n    ```\n\n7. **Check for Conflicting Packages**: Sometimes other installed packages can cause conflicts. List all installed packages and look for potential conflicts:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip list\n    ```\n\n8. **Manual Installation**: If none of the above works, try manually downloading the `python-dotenv` package from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/#files) and install it using pip:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install path_to_downloaded_file.whl\n    ```\n\n9. **Check for System Path Issues**: Ensure that your Python installation and virtual environment paths are correctly set and not conflicting with other Python installations.\n\n10. **Try a Fresh Environment**: As a last resort, create a new virtual environment and attempt the installation again:\n\n    ```bash\n    python -m venv new_env\n    .\\new_env\\Scripts\\activate\n    pip install python-dotenv\n    ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully install `python-dotenv`."
