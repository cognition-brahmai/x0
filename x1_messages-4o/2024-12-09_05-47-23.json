For instance, I have a long-running loop that doesn't produce any output, similar to this:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(100):\n    time.sleep(2)\n```\nI initiated this block a while back, but I can't tell if it's completed or still running as the IPython status bar only displays: `Last Checkpoint: 23 minutes ago (autosaved)`. I don't want to proceed to the next block without knowing the current status of this block. I also don't want to interrupt the kernel and add print statements as it might be close to completion. Is there any feature in IPython - either in the browser window or the console - that would indicate the status of the code currently running?"

        "content": "In IPython notebooks (Jupyter Notebooks), there are a few visual indicators that can help you determine if a cell is still executing:\n\n1. **Asterisk in the Brackets**: One of the most direct indicators is the appearance of an asterisk (*) in the brackets to the left of the cell. For instance, you may see `[ * ]` instead of a number like `[5]`, which indicates that the cell is currently executing.\n\n2. **Kernel Indicator**: In the top right corner of the Jupyter Notebook interface, there's a small circle. If it is solid (filled), it means the kernel is busy executing a task. If it's empty, the kernel is idle.\n\n3. **Status Bar**: As you mentioned, the status bar does not directly indicate the ongoing execution of a cell, but keeping an eye on the kernel indicator can help.\n\n4. **Interrupting and Resuming Execution**: If you're willing to risk a small interruption to check, you can use the \"Interrupt the Kernel\" button (the stop icon) in the Jupyter Notebook toolbar. This will stop the execution of the current cell. After stopping, you can add print statements or other indicators and re-run the cell from where it left off. However, as you noted, this may not be ideal if the cell is close to completion.\n\n5. **Running a Separate Terminal or Console**: If you are running Jupyter via a terminal, you can sometimes see output or messages related to execution in that terminal window, which might give clues about what is currently happening.\n\nTo summarize, the asterisk in the execution brackets and the kernel indicator in the Jupyter interface are your best bets for determining if a cell is still running without adding additional code to the cell itself."
