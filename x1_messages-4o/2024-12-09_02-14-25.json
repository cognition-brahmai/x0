How can I adjust this to skip the tests?"

        "content": "When compiling Python from source, the tests are typically run using the `make test` or `make check` commands. If your tests are running twice, it might be due to some custom configuration in your Makefile or build process that explicitly or implicitly triggers these tests.\n\nHere are some steps to prevent the tests from running:\n\n1. **Skip the Test Step**: Ensure that the `make` command is not explicitly or implicitly calling a test target. You should only use `make` and `make install`, without any test-related targets:\n\n   ```bash\n   make -C dl/Python-${PYTHON_VERSION} -j8\n   make -C dl/Python-${PYTHON_VERSION} install\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Makefile Rules**: Inspect your Makefile for any rules that might invoke testing. Ensure there are no `test` or `check` targets being called.\n\n3. **Environment Variables**: Some build systems use environment variables to control test execution. Ensure that no environment variable is set that would trigger tests automatically.\n\n4. **Parallel Build Considerations**: Sometimes when using `-j` (parallel execution), unintended targets might be built. Make sure that your Makefile is not structured in a way that causes this.\n\n5. **Configuration Options**: During the configuration step, ensure no flags are set that would trigger tests. The `--enable-optimizations` flag should not cause tests to run, but verify if there are other flags or cached options in your `configure` command.\n\n6. **Manual Installation**: If none of the above works, you can manually control the build and installation process by executing the required steps individually, ensuring that no test commands are run.\n\nGiven your setup, you should modify the build script to ensure it only compiles and installs without any test-related commands being executed. If you have control over the Makefile or build scripts, remove any lines related to testing."
