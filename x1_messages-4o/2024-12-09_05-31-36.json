        "content": "To manage fractions of a second in Python, especially when you need more precision than the `datetime` module offers, you can utilize the `time` module or the `datetime` module in combination with the `timedelta` class. However, for even more precision, you can use the `time` module with functions like `time.time()` or `time.perf_counter()`, which provide floating-point numbers with fractions of a second.\n\nHere are a few methods you can use:\n\n1. **Using the `time` module:**\n\n   - `time.time()` returns the current time in seconds since the epoch as a floating-point number, which includes fractions of a second.\n\n     ```python\n     import time\n\n     current_time = time.time()\n     print(f\"Current Time: {current_time} seconds\")\n     ```\n\n   - `time.perf_counter()` provides a higher resolution timer than `time.time()`, suitable for measuring short durations.\n\n     ```python\n     start = time.perf_counter()\n     # ... some code you want to time ...\n     end = time.perf_counter()\n     print(f\"Elapsed time: {end - start} seconds\")\n     ```\n\n2. **Using `datetime` and `timedelta` for microseconds:**\n\n   While the `datetime` module does not natively support nanoseconds, it can handle microseconds.\n\n   ```python\n   from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n   now = datetime.now()\n   # Adding microseconds\n   future_time = now + timedelta(microseconds=500)\n   print(f\"Current Time: {now}\")\n   print(f\"Future Time: {future_time}\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Using third-party libraries:**\n\n   If you need even finer precision, consider using third-party libraries like `numpy` or `pandas` which can handle more precise time intervals efficiently.\n\n   - **Using `pandas`:**\n\n     ```python\n     import pandas as pd\n\n     current_time = pd.Timestamp.now()\n     print(f\"Current Time: {current_time}\")\n\n     # You can also use Timedelta for precise durations\n     precise_duration = pd.Timedelta(microseconds=100)\n     print(f\"Precise Duration: {precise_duration}\")\n     ```\n\n   - **Using `numpy`:**\n\n     ```python\n     import numpy as np\n\n     high_precision_time = np.datetime64('now', 'ns')\n     print(f\"High Precision Time: {high_precision_time}\")\n     ```\n\nThese methods should provide you with the precision you need for handling fractions of a second in Python. Choose the one that best fits your use case and performance requirements."
