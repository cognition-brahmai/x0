        "content": "You can write a function in Python to accomplish this task using simple conditional statements. Here's an example of how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef find_highest(num1, num2, num3):\n    if num1 >= num2 and num1 >= num3:\n        return num1\n    elif num2 >= num1 and num2 >= num3:\n        return num2\n    else:\n        return num3\n\n# Example usage:\nhighest = find_highest(10, 20, 15)\nprint(f\"The highest number is: {highest}\")\n```\n\nIn this function, `find_highest`, three numbers are passed as arguments (`num1`, `num2`, and `num3`). The function checks which number is the greatest using conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, and `else`) and returns the highest number. You can test this function with different sets of numbers to see it in action."
