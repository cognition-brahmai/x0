It's important that the values of the returned integer be uniformly distributed for common data to minimize collisions. Can you provide some best practices for achieving these values? Are collisions a problem? I am working with a small class that acts as a container class holding some integers, floats, and a string."

        "content": "Implementing a good `__hash__()` function in Python is crucial for ensuring that objects can be used effectively in hash-based collections like sets and dictionaries. Here are some best practices to achieve this:\n\n1. **Immutability**: Ensure that the object's hash value does not change over its lifetime. This means that the fields used to calculate the hash should be immutable or the object should be treated as immutable.\n\n2. **Consistent with `__eq__()`**: If two objects are considered equal (i.e., `__eq__()` returns `True`), they must have the same hash value. This is essential for maintaining the integrity of hash-based collections.\n\n3. **Use Tuple of Attributes**: A common technique is to create a tuple of the object's attributes and then return the hash of that tuple. This ensures that all relevant attributes are considered in the hash calculation.\n\n4. **Uniform Distribution**: To minimize collisions, the hash function should produce a uniform distribution of hash values. Python\u2019s built-in `hash()` function already does a good job at this.\n\n5. **Combine Hashes**: If your object has multiple attributes, you can combine their hashes using XOR (`^`) or other techniques to blend them together. This helps in reducing the chances of collisions.\n\n6. **Avoid Collisions**: Collisions can degrade the performance of hash-based collections, but Python's dictionaries handle collisions gracefully. However, minimizing them is still beneficial.\n\nHere\u2019s an example implementation for a class with integer, float, and string attributes:\n\n```python\nclass ContainerClass:\n    def __init__(self, int_attr, float_attr, string_attr):\n        self.int_attr = int_attr\n        self.float_attr = float_attr\n        self.string_attr = string_attr\n\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        if not isinstance(other, ContainerClass):\n            return False\n        return (self.int_attr == other.int_attr and\n                self.float_attr == other.float_attr and\n                self.string_attr == other.string_attr)\n\n    def __hash__(self):\n        # Create a tuple of the attributes\n        attributes = (self.int_attr, self.float_attr, self.string_attr)\n        # Return the hash of the tuple\n        return hash(attributes)\n```\n\nIn this example, we ensure that `__eq__()` and `__hash__()` are consistent with each other. We use a tuple of the attributes to compute the hash, which ensures that all relevant attributes contribute to the hash value. Python's `hash()` function is capable of providing a good distribution of hash values, helping to minimize collisions.\n\nRemember, while collisions are a consideration, Python's dictionaries are designed to handle them effectively. Your primary goal should be to maintain consistency and ensure a good distribution of hash values."
