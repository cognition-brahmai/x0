However, when I try to install dlib from the command prompt, I get an error that says \"Cannot find cmake, ensure it is installed and in the path. You can also specify its path with --cmake parameter.\" Can you provide a solution for this problem?"

        "content": "To install dlib on Windows 10, especially when you encounter the error related to CMake, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install CMake:**\n   - Download the latest version of CMake from the official [CMake website](https://cmake.org/download/).\n   - Choose the Windows installer version and install it.\n   - During installation, make sure to select the option to \"Add CMake to the system PATH for all users\" or \"Add CMake to the system PATH for the current user.\"\n\n2. **Install Visual Studio:**\n   - Install Visual Studio Community Edition from the [Visual Studio Downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).\n   - During installation, ensure that you select the \"Desktop development with C++\" workload. This will provide you with the necessary build tools for compiling dlib.\n\n3. **Install Boost and other dependencies (optional but recommended):**\n   - Download and install Boost, which can be helpful if you plan to use some advanced features of dlib. You can find it on the [Boost website](https://www.boost.org/).\n   - Extract the Boost files to a directory, e.g., `C:\\local\\boost`.\n\n4. **Install Python and Pip:**\n   - Ensure that Python and pip are installed on your system and are accessible via the command prompt. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n   - Make sure to add Python to the system PATH during installation.\n\n5. **Install dlib using pip:**\n   - Open a command prompt and upgrade pip to the latest version:\n     ```bash\n     python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n     ```\n   - Install dlib using pip:\n     ```bash\n     pip install dlib\n     ```\n\n6. **Troubleshooting:**\n   - If you encounter any issues related to CMake or Visual Studio versions, ensure that your PATH includes the directories where these tools are installed. You can manually add them to the PATH environment variable by navigating to:\n     - Control Panel -> System and Security -> System -> Advanced system settings -> Environment Variables\n   - Add the paths for CMake and Visual Studio's `vcvarsall.bat` (usually found in `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Community\\VC\\Auxiliary\\Build\\`) to the PATH variable.\n\n7. **Verify Installation:**\n   - You can verify the installation by starting a Python shell and running:\n     ```python\n     import dlib\n     ```\n\nIf you follow these steps, you should be able to successfully install dlib on your Windows 10 system for use with Python and OpenCV."
