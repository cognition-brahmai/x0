I want to shuffle the order of DataFrame's rows so that the 'Type' values are mixed. Here is what my DataFrame currently looks like:\n\n```python\n    Col1  Col2  Col3  Type\n0      1     2     3     1\n1      4     5     6     1\n...\n20     7     8     9     2\n21    10    11    12     2\n...\n45    13    14    15     3\n46    16    17    18     3\n...\n```\n\nI want it to potentially look like this after shuffling:\n\n```python\n    Col1  Col2  Col3  Type\n0      7     8     9     2\n1     13    14    15     3\n...\n20     1     2     3     1\n21    10    11    12     2\n...\n45     4     5     6     1\n46    16    17    18     3\n...\n```\n\nHow can I accomplish this?"

        "content": "To shuffle the rows of your DataFrame such that the 'Type' values are mixed, you can use the `pandas` library's `sample` method. This method allows you to randomly permute the rows of a DataFrame. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming 'df' is your DataFrame\ndf = pd.read_csv('your_file.csv')\n\n# Shuffle the DataFrame\nshuffled_df = df.sample(frac=1).reset_index(drop=True)\n\n# Display the shuffled DataFrame\nprint(shuffled_df)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening in the code:\n\n- `df.sample(frac=1)`: This line samples all of the rows (`frac=1` means 100% of the rows) from the DataFrame and effectively shuffles them.\n- `.reset_index(drop=True)`: This line resets the index of the shuffled DataFrame so that it starts from 0 again, and `drop=True` ensures that the old index is not added as a column to the DataFrame.\n\nThis should give you a DataFrame where the 'Type' values are mixed randomly, as you wanted."
