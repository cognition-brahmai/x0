Here is how you can achieve that:\n\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.attribute1 = 'value1'\n        self.attribute2 = 'value2'\n        self.attribute3 = 'value3'\n\n# Create an instance of the class\nmy_object = MyClass()\n\n# Enumerate the object's properties\nfor property_name in dir(my_object):\n    # Filter out built-in properties and methods\n    if not property_name.startswith('__'):\n        current_property_value = getattr(my_object, property_name)\n        print(f\"{property_name}: {current_property_value}\")\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `dir(my_object)` returns a list of all the attributes, including methods, of the `my_object` instance.\n- `property_name.startswith('__')` filters out the built-in properties and methods that start and end with double underscores (often referred to as \"dunder\" methods or attributes).\n- `getattr(my_object, property_name)` retrieves the value of each attribute.\n\nThis approach will list all the public attributes of an object, similar to how reflection or property enumeration works in other programming languages."
