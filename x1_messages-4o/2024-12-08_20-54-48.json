Along with the given example \"The singer joyfully belted their solo\", I also need to ensure that the sentence follows proper subject-verb agreement. Can you provide a sample code that can perform these tasks efficiently?"

        "content": "To identify grammatical errors in a sentence using Python, you can leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries such as `spaCy` or `Grammarly`. For subject-verb agreement and other grammatical checks, `LanguageTool` is another popular option.\n\nHere's a sample code using `LanguageTool` to identify grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement:\n\nFirst, you'll need to install the `language-tool-python` library:\n\n```bash\npip install language-tool-python\n```\n\nThen, you can use the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport language_tool_python\n\n# Initialize the language tool\ntool = language_tool_python.LanguageTool('en-US')\n\n# Example sentence\nsentence = \"The singer joyfully belted their solo\"\n\n# Check the sentence for grammatical errors\nmatches = tool.check(sentence)\n\n# Process and display the errors\nif matches:\n    print(\"Grammatical errors found:\")\n    for match in matches:\n        print(f\"Error: {match.message}\")\n        print(f\"Suggested Correction: {match.replacements}\")\n        print(f\"Error Context: {sentence[match.offset:match.offset + match.errorLength]}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No grammatical errors found.\")\n\n# Close tool\ntool.close()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **LanguageTool**: It's a tool for detecting grammar mistakes, and it supports a wide array of error types, including subject-verb agreement.\n- **Initialization**: You initialize the `LanguageTool` object with the desired language (e.g., 'en-US' for American English).\n- **Check Method**: The `check` method analyzes the sentence and returns a list of matches (errors).\n- **Error Details**: For each match, you get the error message, suggested corrections, and the context of the error.\n\nThis code will help you identify grammatical errors in sentences, including issues related to subject-verb agreement. You can further expand it to process multiple sentences or integrate it into a larger application."
