I am using the Sympy library to solve a list of equations with two unknown variables. However, after solving it with the `linsolve()` method, the result is a `finiteset` object that I'm unable to extract the results from into a variable. I have tried using dicts, lists, tuples, indexing commands, but I always get an error stating \"Finiteset objects has no attribute 'command'\". How can I solve this problem?\n\nHere is an example of the code I'm running:\n\n```python\na1, a2 = symbols('a1, a2')\neq2_1 = Eq(-3*a1/10 - 3*a2/20 + 1/12)\neq2_2 = Eq(-3*a1/20 - 13*a2/105 + 1/20)\nlista = [eq2_1,eq2_2]\na = linsolve(lista,a1,a2)\n```\n\nThe output of `a` is: `{(71/369, 7/41)}`"

        "content": "To extract values from a `FiniteSet` object returned by Sympy's `linsolve()` function, you need to understand that the result is a set containing tuples of solutions. In your case, it appears as `{(71/369, 7/41)}` indicating a single solution tuple within a `FiniteSet`. You can easily extract the values by iterating over the set or converting it to a list. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, linsolve\n\n# Define symbols\na1, a2 = symbols('a1 a2')\n\n# Define equations\neq2_1 = Eq(-3*a1/10 - 3*a2/20 + 1/12)\neq2_2 = Eq(-3*a1/20 - 13*a2/105 + 1/20)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolutions = linsolve([eq2_1, eq2_2], a1, a2)\n\n# Extract the solution from the FiniteSet\nfor solution in solutions:\n    # 'solution' is a tuple containing the values for a1 and a2\n    a1_value, a2_value = solution\n    print(f\"a1 = {a1_value}, a2 = {a2_value}\")\n\n# Alternatively, convert the FiniteSet to a list and access the first element\nsolution_list = list(solutions)\nif solution_list:\n    a1_value, a2_value = solution_list[0]\n    print(f\"a1 = {a1_value}, a2 = {a2_value}\")\n```\n\nIn this code, we either iterate over the `FiniteSet` to unpack the solution tuple or convert the `FiniteSet` to a list and access the first element. Both methods will give you the values of `a1` and `a2` that solve the system of equations."
