The first time Python encounters it, it is imported, but what happens the second time? Does Python check if the module has been imported, or does it make a copy?\n\nIn the second scenario, consider the following module, called bla.py:\n\n```\na = 10\n```\n\nWe also have another module, foo.py, which imports bla.py:\n\n```\nfrom bla import *\n\ndef Stuff ():\n    return a\n```\n\nFinally, we have a script called bar.py, which gets executed by the user:\n\n```\nfrom foo import *\nStuff() #This should return 10 \na = 5\nStuff()\n```\n\nIn this case, what does `Stuff()` return? Is it 10 or 5?"

        "content": "Let's address each of your questions regarding Python importing:\n\n### First Scenario: Importing the Same Module in Two Scripts\n\nWhen you import a module in Python, it is loaded into memory, and a reference to that module is stored in the `sys.modules` dictionary. The first time a module is imported, Python executes the module's code and creates an entry in `sys.modules`. Subsequent imports of the same module will not re-execute the module's code; instead, Python will use the already-loaded instance from `sys.modules`.\n\nSo, if you import the same module in two different scripts, Python will not import and execute the module twice. Instead, it will check `sys.modules`, find that the module is already loaded, and reuse that instance.\n\n### Second Scenario: Understanding the `Stuff()` Function\n\nIn your example, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Module `bla.py`:** \n   ```python\n   a = 10\n   ```\n\n2. **Module `foo.py`:** \n   ```python\n   from bla import *\n\n   def Stuff():\n       return a\n   ```\n\n3. **Script `bar.py`:** \n   ```python\n   from foo import *\n   Stuff() # This should return 10\n   a = 5\n   Stuff()\n   ```\n\nHere\u2019s what happens:\n\n- When `bar.py` is executed, it imports everything from `foo.py`, which in turn imports everything from `bla.py`. The variable `a` from `bla.py` is imported with the value `10`.\n\n- The first call to `Stuff()` in `bar.py` will return `10` because `Stuff()` references `a` from `bla.py`, which is initially set to `10`.\n\n- Then, you set `a = 5` in `bar.py`. This creates a new local variable `a` in the `bar.py` namespace, shadowing the `a` from `bla.py`.\n\n- The second call to `Stuff()` will still return `10` because `Stuff()` uses its own reference to `a` that was imported from `bla.py`, not the local `a` defined in `bar.py`. The function `Stuff()` doesn't see the changes made to `a` in `bar.py` since it captured the value of `a` from `bla.py` at the time of import.\n\nThus, the output for both calls to `Stuff()` is `10`."
