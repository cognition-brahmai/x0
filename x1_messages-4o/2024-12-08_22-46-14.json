Here are four measures to help prevent the spread of COVID-19:\n\n1. **Wear Masks**: Use masks that cover both your nose and mouth, especially in crowded or indoor settings, to reduce the transmission of respiratory droplets.\n\n2. **Practice Social Distancing**: Maintain a safe distance (at least 6 feet) from others, particularly in situations where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.\n\n3. **Hand Hygiene**: Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol to kill any viruses that may be on your hands.\n\n4. **Vaccination**: Get vaccinated and stay up-to-date with booster shots as recommended by health authorities to protect yourself and reduce the spread of the virus.\n\nThese measures, combined with staying informed about local health guidelines and avoiding large gatherings, can significantly reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission."
