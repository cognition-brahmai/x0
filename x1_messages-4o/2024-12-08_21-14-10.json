        "content": "To efficiently identify the longest consecutive sequence of prime numbers, calculate their sum, and find the average value of non-prime numbers in Excel, you can use a combination of formulas and VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) for more advanced operations. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Prime Numbers\n\n1. **Add a Helper Column:** Create a helper column to identify if a number is prime. Let's assume your data is in column A starting from A2.\n\n2. **Prime Check Formula:** In cell B2, use the following formula to check if a number is prime:\n   ```excel\n   =IF(A2<2, FALSE, IF(A2=2, TRUE, IF(MOD(A2,2)=0, FALSE, SUMPRODUCT(--(MOD(A2,ROW(INDIRECT(\"2:\"&INT(SQRT(A2)))))=0))=0)))\n   ```\n   Drag this formula down to fill the column for all your numbers.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Longest Consecutive Sequence of Primes\n\n3. **Consecutive Sequence Counter:** In column C, track the length of consecutive prime sequences. Place this formula in cell C2:\n   ```excel\n   =IF(B2, IF(B1, C1+1, 1), 0)\n   ```\n   Drag this formula down through your dataset.\n\n4. **Identify Maximum Sequence:** Use an additional cell, say D1, to find the maximum length of consecutive primes:\n   ```excel\n   =MAX(C:C)\n   ```\n\n5. **Locate the Sequence:** To identify the start of the longest sequence, use the following formula in E1:\n   ```excel\n   =MATCH(D1, C:C, 0)\n   ```\n   This will give you the row number where the longest sequence starts.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Sum of the Longest Prime Sequence\n\n6. **Sum of Longest Sequence:** Use the following formula in F1 to calculate the sum of the longest sequence:\n   ```excel\n   =SUM(OFFSET(A1, E1-1, 0, D1, 1))\n   ```\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Average of Non-Prime Numbers\n\n7. **Average of Non-Primes:** Use this formula in G1 to calculate the average of non-prime numbers:\n   ```excel\n   =AVERAGEIF(B:B, FALSE, A:A)\n   ```\n\n### Step 5: VBA for Larger Datasets\n\nFor larger datasets, you can automate this process with VBA to optimize speed and efficiency. Here's a basic script to automate the prime identification and sequence detection:\n\n```vba\nSub CalculatePrimeSequences()\n    Dim ws As Worksheet\n    Dim lastRow As Long\n    Dim i As Long\n    Dim currentSeq As Long\n    Dim maxSeq As Long\n    Dim startRow As Long\n    Dim primeSum As Long\n    Dim nonPrimeSum As Long\n    Dim nonPrimeCount As Long\n    \n    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets(\"Sheet1\") ' Adjust sheet name as necessary\n    lastRow = ws.Cells(ws.Rows.Count, \"A\").End(xlUp).Row\n    \n    maxSeq = 0\n    currentSeq = 0\n    primeSum = 0\n    nonPrimeSum = 0\n    nonPrimeCount = 0\n    \n    For i = 2 To lastRow\n        If IsPrime(ws.Cells(i, 1).Value) Then\n            currentSeq = currentSeq + 1\n            primeSum = primeSum + ws.Cells(i, 1).Value\n            If currentSeq > maxSeq Then\n                maxSeq = currentSeq\n                startRow = i - maxSeq + 1\n            End If\n        Else\n            currentSeq = 0\n            nonPrimeSum = nonPrimeSum + ws.Cells(i, 1).Value\n            nonPrimeCount = nonPrimeCount + 1\n        End If\n    Next i\n    \n    ' Output results\n    ws.Cells(1, 5).Value = \"Max Prime Seq Length\"\n    ws.Cells(1, 6).Value = \"Start Row\"\n    ws.Cells(1, 7).Value = \"Sum of Primes in Seq\"\n    ws.Cells(1, 8).Value = \"Average of Non-Primes\"\n    \n    ws.Cells(2, 5).Value = maxSeq\n    ws.Cells(2, 6).Value = startRow\n    ws.Cells(2, 7).Value = primeSum\n    ws.Cells(2, 8).Value = IIf(nonPrimeCount > 0, nonPrimeSum / nonPrimeCount, 0)\nEnd Sub\n\nFunction IsPrime(number As Long) As Boolean\n    Dim i As Long\n    If number < 2 Then\n        IsPrime = False\n        Exit Function\n    End If\n    If number = 2 Then\n        IsPrime = True\n        Exit Function\n    End If\n    If number Mod 2 = 0 Then\n        IsPrime = False\n        Exit Function\n    End If\n    For i = 3 To Sqr(number) Step 2\n        If number Mod i = 0 Then\n            IsPrime = False\n            Exit Function\n        End If\n    Next i\n    IsPrime = True\nEnd Function\n```\n\n### How to Use the VBA Script\n\n1. Press `ALT + F11` to open the VBA editor.\n2. Insert a new module via `Insert > Module`.\n3. Copy and paste the script into the module.\n4. Run the `CalculatePrimeSequences` macro to execute the script.\n\nThis solution will handle large datasets efficiently by automating the process and reducing the number of manual steps required. Adjust the script and formulas as needed for your specific dataset and sheet configuration."
