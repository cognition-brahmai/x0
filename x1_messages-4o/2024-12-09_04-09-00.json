However, I am encountering an ImportError when I try to import gof from theano. I attempted to install Keras using the command `conda install keras` and then tried to install Theano with `pip install Theano` but neither worked. I also tried to install using `pip install git` but received an error saying \"cannot find command git\". After installing Git and setting the environment variables, the problem still persisted. Is there a specific procedure to install these packages?"

You can download it from the Anaconda [official website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).\n\n### Step 2: Create a New Conda Environment\nIt\u2019s a good practice to create a new environment for your project to avoid dependency conflicts.\n\nOpen the Anaconda Prompt and execute the following commands:\n\n```bash\nconda create -n keras_theano_env python=3.8\nconda activate keras_theano_env\n```\n\n### Step 3: Install Theano\nUsing `conda` to install Theano is usually more reliable since it handles dependencies better than `pip` on Windows.\n\n```bash\nconda install theano\n```\n\n### Step 4: Install Keras\nOnce Theano is installed, you can proceed to install Keras. It\u2019s beneficial to keep the installation within the conda environment.\n\n```bash\nconda install keras\n```\n\n### Step 5: Verify Installation\nTo ensure Theano and Keras are installed correctly, you can run a simple script in Python:\n\n```python\nimport theano\nimport keras\n\nprint(\"Theano version:\", theano.__version__)\nprint(\"Keras version:\", keras.__version__)\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting Tips\n1. **Conda vs. Pip**: Always prefer `conda` over `pip` when installing packages in Anaconda, especially for packages like Theano that have complex dependencies.\n\n2. **Git Installation**: If you had issues with Git, ensure it's correctly installed and added to your system's PATH. You can check by running `git --version` in your command prompt.\n\n3. **Environment Variables**: Ensure your Anaconda environment is activated when running your Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks.\n\n4. **Check for Updates**: Sometimes, updating Anaconda itself can resolve package conflicts. Use `conda update conda` and `conda update anaconda`.\n\n5. **Alternative Installations**: If you continue to face issues, consider using a virtual environment via `virtualenv` instead of Conda, or using Docker to set up your environment.\n\nFollowing these steps should help you set up Keras and Theano on your Windows machine successfully. If any specific error messages persist, please provide them for further assistance."
