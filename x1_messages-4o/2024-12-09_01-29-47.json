I have tried using the Atom Hashrocket and Python Debugger packages, but the former does not allow stepping through the code and the latter does not support watched variables. Can anyone suggest a solution?"

        "content": "Atom is a versatile text editor with a range of packages available to extend its functionality. However, when it comes to debugging, Atom isn't as fully featured as some dedicated IDEs like PyCharm or Visual Studio Code. That said, there are a few approaches you might consider:\n\n1. **Atom IDE Debugger**: The Atom IDE package, which is part of the Atom IDE project, provides a more integrated development environment experience. It includes support for debugging, though it's generally more limited than full-fledged IDEs. You can try installing `atom-ide-ui` and `atom-ide-debugger-python` to see if they meet your needs. This combination should offer basic debugging features, including breakpoints and stepping through code.\n\n2. **Hydrogen**: While primarily used for running code interactively, Hydrogen can be useful for exploring variables. It is based on Jupyter and allows you to execute Python code blocks and inspect outputs directly within Atom. Although it doesn't provide traditional debugging features, it can be helpful for checking variable states.\n\n3. **Visual Studio Code**: If you're open to trying a different editor, Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular choice with robust debugging capabilities for Python. The Python extension for VS Code includes a powerful debugger with support for breakpoints, variable watches, and more.\n\n4. **Alternative IDEs**: If Atom's capabilities don't meet your requirements, consider using a dedicated Python IDE like PyCharm, which provides comprehensive debugging tools, including variable watching, interactive consoles, and more.\n\nWhile Atom is a great text editor, its debugging capabilities are somewhat limited compared to dedicated IDEs. If debugging is a critical part of your workflow, exploring other options might be beneficial."
