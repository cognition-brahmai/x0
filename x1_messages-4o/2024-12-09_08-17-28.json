Why do I need the descriptor class?\n2. What is `instance` and `owner` here? (in `__get__`). What is the purpose of these parameters?\n3. How would I call/use this example?"

        "content": "Certainly! Let's go through your doubts one by one:\n\n1. **Why do I need the descriptor class?**\n\n   Descriptors in Python are a way to create managed attributes. They allow you to customize attribute access at a lower level than properties. Descriptors are useful when you want to reuse the same logic across multiple attributes or classes. In this case, the `Celsius` class is a descriptor that manages how you get and set the `celsius` attribute of the `Temperature` class. This encapsulates the logic for managing the value, such as converting it to a float, which can be reused or extended easily.\n\n2. **What is `instance` and `owner` here? (in `__get__`). What is the purpose of these parameters?**\n\n   - `instance`: This parameter refers to the instance of the class where the descriptor is being accessed. If the descriptor is accessed through the class itself and not an instance, `instance` will be `None`.\n   \n   - `owner`: This parameter is the class that owns the descriptor. It's the class where the descriptor is defined as a class attribute.\n\n   These parameters allow the descriptor to know the context in which it's being accessed, which can be useful for complex behavior. For example, based on the `instance`, the descriptor can decide whether to return a value specific to that instance or a shared value.\n\n3. **How would I call/use this example?**\n\n   You can use the `Temperature` class and its `celsius` attribute as follows:\n\n   ```python\n   temp = Temperature()      # Create an instance of Temperature\n   print(temp.celsius)       # Access the celsius attribute, which uses the __get__ method of Celsius\n\n   temp.celsius = 37.5       # Set the celsius attribute, which uses the __set__ method of Celsius\n   print(temp.celsius)       # Access the updated celsius attribute\n   ```\n\n   Here's what's happening in this example:\n\n   - When you access `temp.celsius`, Python calls the `__get__` method of the `Celsius` descriptor. The `instance` parameter is `temp`, and the `owner` parameter is `Temperature`.\n   \n   - When you set `temp.celsius`, Python calls the `__set__` method of the `Celsius` descriptor. The `instance` is `temp`, and the `value` is whatever you assign to `temp.celsius`.\n\n   Descriptors provide a powerful way to manage attributes, allowing you to control how they are accessed and modified, making them ideal for cases where you want to enforce specific behaviors or constraints on attribute values."
