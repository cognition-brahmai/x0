I have written a simple back-propagation neural network, which uses sigmoid activation functions, random weight initialization, and learning/gradient momentum. When configured with 2 inputs, 2 hidden nodes, and 1 output node, my network fails to learn XOR and AND logic gates. However, it successfully learns OR logic gate. I've tested with 2 hidden nodes but the code below shows a configuration of 3. I forgot to change this back to 2 after running tests using 3 hidden nodes. I am unable to understand what I've done wrong, can anyone assist me on this?"

        "content": "Implementing a neural network to learn logic gates is a great way to understand how these systems work. Let's go through some key areas to troubleshoot your implementation when it comes to learning XOR, AND, and OR logic gates.\n\n1. **XOR Problem**: The XOR logic gate is not linearly separable, which means a single-layer perceptron (without a hidden layer) cannot solve it. However, since you're using a network with hidden layers, theoretically, it should be able to learn XOR if everything else is correct.\n\n2. **Network Configuration**: You've mentioned that you tested with both 2 and 3 hidden nodes. Generally, a small network with 2 hidden nodes should be able to learn XOR. However, more nodes could potentially make the learning easier, given a proper training regime.\n\n3. **Activation Function**: The sigmoid activation function is a common choice, but it can suffer from vanishing gradients, especially with deeper networks or poor weight initialization. Make sure your inputs are normalized, as sigmoid functions work best with inputs between 0 and 1.\n\n4. **Weight Initialization**: Random weight initialization is critical. If weights are too small, the network may not learn; if too large, it could explode. A common approach is to use Xavier (Glorot) initialization for sigmoid activations.\n\n5. **Learning Rate and Momentum**: Ensure your learning rate is neither too high nor too low. A high learning rate can cause overshooting, while a low rate can make the learning process very slow or get stuck in local minima. Momentum can help accelerate learning in the right direction, but needs to be tuned as well.\n\n6. **Training Data**: Double-check your training data and labels. Make sure they are correctly implemented for XOR, AND, and OR gates.\n\n7. **Error Function**: Use a suitable error function like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and monitor it over training epochs to understand if the network is converging.\n\n8. **Debugging Steps**:\n   - Visualize the decision boundary to see how well the network is separating the classes.\n   - Print the weights and biases after training to see if they are updating as expected.\n   - Track the loss over time to ensure it is decreasing.\n\nIf you'd like, you can share your code, and I can help pinpoint specific issues or suggest improvements."
