When I try to add a new player in the Admin section of Django, I keep receiving an error message stating \"This field is required.\" Is it possible to accomplish this within models.py or admin.py? Here is what my class in models.py currently looks like:\n```python\nclass PlayerStat(models.Model):\n    player = models.ForeignKey(Player)\n\n    rushing_attempts = models.CharField(\n        max_length = 100,\n        verbose_name = \"Rushing Attempts\"\n        )\n    rushing_yards = models.CharField(\n        max_length = 100,\n        verbose_name = \"Rushing Yards\"\n        )\n    rushing_touchdowns = models.CharField(\n        max_length = 100,\n        verbose_name = \"Rushing Touchdowns\"\n        )\n    passing_attempts = models.CharField(\n        max_length = 100,\n        verbose_name = \"Passing Attempts\"\n        )\n```"
    },

        "content": "To make a field not mandatory in Django, you can set the `blank` attribute to `True` in your model field definitions. The `blank` attribute is specifically used to determine whether a field is required in forms. Setting `blank=True` allows the field to be optional in forms, including the Django admin interface. Here's how you can adjust your `PlayerStat` model:\n\n```python\nclass PlayerStat(models.Model):\n    player = models.ForeignKey(Player, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n\n    rushing_attempts = models.CharField(\n        max_length=100,\n        verbose_name=\"Rushing Attempts\",\n        blank=True  # Field is optional in forms\n    )\n    rushing_yards = models.CharField(\n        max_length=100,\n        verbose_name=\"Rushing Yards\",\n        blank=True  # Field is optional in forms\n    )\n    rushing_touchdowns = models.CharField(\n        max_length=100,\n        verbose_name=\"Rushing Touchdowns\",\n        blank=True  # Field is optional in forms\n    )\n    passing_attempts = models.CharField(\n        max_length=100,\n        verbose_name=\"Passing Attempts\",\n        blank=True  # Field is optional in forms\n    )\n```\n\nAdditionally, make sure your foreign key relation is complete by specifying `on_delete` behavior, as it is required from Django 2.0 onwards.\n\nAfter making these changes, run `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate` to apply the changes to your database schema.\n\nThese changes will make the specified fields optional in the Django admin interface, and you should no longer receive the \"This field is required\" error when adding a new player if those fields are left empty."
