        "content": "How can I fetch a row-by-row MySQL ResultSet in Python? By default, MySQL ResultSets are retrieved completely from the server before any work can be done. This becomes an issue when dealing with very large result sets. In Java, I am able to retrieve the rows one by one from the server by creating a statement like this:\n\n```\nstmt = conn.createStatement(java.sql.ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY,\n              java.sql.ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY);\nstmt.setFetchSize(Integer.MIN_VALUE);\n```\n\nIs there a similar way to achieve this in Python? I tried limiting the query to a 1000 rows at a time as shown:\n\n```\nstart_row = 0\nwhile True:\n    cursor = conn.cursor()\n    cursor.execute(\"SELECT item FROM items LIMIT %d,1000\" % start_row)\n    rows = cursor.fetchall()\n    if not rows:\n        break\n    start_row += 1000\n    # Do something with rows...\n```\n\nHowever, this seems to slow down as the start_row increases. I've also tried using `fetchone()` instead of `fetchall()`, but there was no change. Is there a better way to fetch large result sets row by row in Python?"

        "content": "To fetch large MySQL result sets row by row in Python without loading the entire result set into memory, you can use the `MySQLdb` or `mysql-connector-python` library's cursor with an iterator. This way, the results are fetched one by one from the server as needed, rather than all at once.\n\nHere's an example using `mysql-connector-python`, which supports server-side cursors (also known as buffered and unbuffered cursors):\n\n### Using `mysql-connector-python`\n\n1. **Install the library** if you haven't already:\n\n   ```sh\n   pip install mysql-connector-python\n   ```\n\n2. **Use an unbuffered cursor** to fetch data row by row:\n\n   ```python\n   import mysql.connector\n\n   # Establish the connection\n   conn = mysql.connector.connect(\n       host='your_host',\n       user='your_username',\n       password='your_password',\n       database='your_database'\n   )\n\n   # Create an unbuffered cursor\n   cursor = conn.cursor(buffered=False)\n\n   # Execute the query\n   cursor.execute(\"SELECT item FROM items\")\n\n   # Fetch rows one by one\n   for row in cursor:\n       # Do something with each row\n       print(row)\n\n   # Close the cursor and connection\n   cursor.close()\n   conn.close()\n   ```\n\n### Notes:\n\n- **Buffered vs Unbuffered Cursors**: By default, `mysql-connector-python` uses buffered cursors, which retrieve all results upfront. By setting `buffered=False`, you switch to an unbuffered cursor, which fetches rows as you iterate over them.\n  \n- **Memory Efficiency**: Unbuffered cursors help in reducing memory usage because rows are fetched one at a time instead of all at once. This is especially useful for large data sets.\n\n### Performance Considerations:\n\n- **Network Latency**: Fetching rows one by one can introduce network latency. However, if your main concern is memory usage, this trade-off might be acceptable.\n  \n- **Batch Fetching**: If performance becomes an issue, consider fetching rows in small batches instead of one by one, which can reduce the number of round trips to the server while still being memory efficient.\n\nBy using these techniques, you can handle large result sets efficiently in Python, similar to what you were able to achieve in Java."
