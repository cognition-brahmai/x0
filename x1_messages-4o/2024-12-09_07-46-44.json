Here is what I am doing:\n\n```python\nimport mock\n@mock.patch('datetime.date.today')\ndef today(cls):\n  return date(2010, 1, 1)\n\nfrom datetime import date\ndate.today()\n```\n\nBut instead of returning the mocked date (2010, 1, 1), it's showing the current date (2010, 12, 19). Can anyone explain why this is happening and suggest a better way to achieve this?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the scope and application of the `mock.patch` decorator. When using the `mock.patch` decorator, it temporarily replaces the target with a mock object only within the scope of the decorated function. Since you're calling `date.today()` outside of the `today` function, the patch isn't applied.\n\nTo correctly mock `datetime.date.today()`, you need to ensure that the mock is active when `date.today()` is called. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\nfrom datetime import date\n\n# Use patch as a context manager\nwith patch('datetime.date.today') as mock_today:\n    mock_today.return_value = date(2010, 1, 1)\n    # Now when date.today() is called, it will return the mocked date\n    print(date.today())  # Output: 2010-01-01\n\n# Outside the context manager, date.today() returns the actual current date\nprint(date.today())  # Output: Current date\n```\n\nKey points:\n- Use `unittest.mock.patch` as a context manager to ensure the patch is only applied within the desired scope.\n- Set the `return_value` of the mock object to the desired mock date.\n- Ensure all calls to the method you want to mock occur within the context manager block.\n\nThis approach allows you to control the behavior of `date.today()` temporarily and ensures that it returns the mock date only where you intend it to."
