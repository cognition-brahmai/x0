I tried using the `__new__()` method but it caused errors with `__init__()` arguments. I ended up using a static method called `get`, but is there a better way to solve this problem?\n\nHere's the code I used initially:\n\n```\nclass Flub(object):\n    instances = {}\n\n    def __new__(cls, flubid):\n        try:\n            self = Flub.instances[flubid]\n        except KeyError:\n            self = Flub.instances[flubid] = super(Flub, cls).__new__(cls)\n            print 'making a new one!'\n            self.flubid = flubid\n        print id(self)\n        return self\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def destroy_all():\n        for flub in Flub.instances.values():\n            print 'killing', flub\n\na = Flub('foo')\nb = Flub('foo')\nc = Flub('bar')\n\nprint a\nprint b\nprint c\nprint a is b, b is c\n\nFlub.destroy_all()\n```"

        "content": "To memoize class instantiation in Python, especially when you want to ensure that only one instance of a class exists for each unique identifier (in your case, a filename), you can indeed use the `__new__` method. However, it seems like you encountered issues with `__init__` arguments. The `__new__` method is responsible for creating a new instance of a class, while `__init__` initializes it. \n\nTo solve your problem effectively, you can maintain a class-level dictionary to store instances and ensure that `__new__` correctly handles instance creation. Here's a refined version of your code:\n\n```python\nclass Flub(object):\n    _instances = {}\n\n    def __new__(cls, flubid):\n        if flubid in cls._instances:\n            return cls._instances[flubid]\n        else:\n            instance = super(Flub, cls).__new__(cls)\n            cls._instances[flubid] = instance\n            return instance\n\n    def __init__(self, flubid):\n        # Initialization logic should only run once per unique instance\n        if not hasattr(self, '_initialized'):\n            self.flubid = flubid\n            print('Initializing with flubid:', flubid)\n            self._initialized = True\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def destroy_all():\n        for flub in Flub._instances.values():\n            print('Destroying', flub.flubid)\n        Flub._instances.clear()\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"<Flub(flubid={self.flubid})>\"\n\n# Example usage\na = Flub('foo')\nb = Flub('foo')\nc = Flub('bar')\n\nprint(a)\nprint(b)\nprint(c)\nprint(a is b, b is c)\n\nFlub.destroy_all()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Class-Level Dictionary**: Use a class-level dictionary `_instances` to store and retrieve instances based on the unique identifier `flubid`.\n2. **`__new__` Method**: This method checks if an instance already exists for the given `flubid`. If it does, it returns the existing instance; otherwise, it creates a new one.\n3. **`__init__` Method**: This method is called after `__new__` and should only perform initialization once per instance. We use an instance attribute `_initialized` to ensure that initialization logic runs only once per instance.\n4. **`destroy_all` Method**: This static method clears the stored instances and can perform any cleanup actions needed.\n\nWith this setup, you ensure that each unique `flubid` corresponds to a single instance of `Flub`, and you avoid unnecessary reinitialization."
