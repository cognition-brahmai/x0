This could be accomplished by finding the set difference between the two arrays and calculating its size. How would you approach solving this problem? Take for example the arrays: array1 = [2, 3, 7, 8] and array2 = [3, 2, 8, 7]. How many unique elements do they have?"

        "content": "To determine the number of distinct elements between the two arrays, you can use the concept of set operations. Specifically, you'll want to find the symmetric difference between the two arrays, which includes elements that are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. Here's how you can approach solving this problem:\n\n1. Convert both arrays into sets. This will automatically remove any duplicate elements within each array.\n2. Calculate the symmetric difference between the two sets. The symmetric difference can be found using the set operation `(set1 ^ set2)` in Python, or `set1.symmetric_difference(set2)`.\n3. Count the number of elements in the resulting set, which represents the number of distinct elements between the two arrays.\n\nLet's apply this approach to the given example:\n\n```python\narray1 = [2, 3, 7, 8]\narray2 = [3, 2, 8, 7]\n\n# Convert arrays to sets\nset1 = set(array1)\nset2 = set(array2)\n\n# Calculate the symmetric difference\nsymmetric_difference = set1 ^ set2\n\n# Count the number of distinct elements\nnum_distinct_elements = len(symmetric_difference)\n\nprint(num_distinct_elements)\n```\n\nIn this particular example, since both arrays contain the same elements, albeit in different orders, the symmetric difference is an empty set. Therefore, the number of distinct elements between the two arrays is `0`."
