I have two functions, func1 and func2, and I am trying to call them within a wrapper function. Here is the code I am working with:\n\n```python\ndef wrapper(func, args):\n    func(args)\n\ndef func1(x):\n    print(x)\n\ndef func2(x, y, z):\n    return x+y+z\n\nwrapper(func1, [x])\nwrapper(func2, [x, y, z])\n```\nThe first call to the wrapper function works, but the second one doesn't. I would like to modify the wrapper function so that it can handle calls to both func1 and func2. The modifications should not affect func1 and func2. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that `func2` requires three arguments, but you're passing a single list as the second argument to the `wrapper` function. To fix this, you can unpack the list of arguments inside the `wrapper` function using the `*` operator, which will allow you to pass the elements of the list as separate arguments to the function being called.\n\nHere's how you can modify the `wrapper` function to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef wrapper(func, args):\n    func(*args)  # Unpack the list of arguments\n\ndef func1(x):\n    print(x)\n\ndef func2(x, y, z):\n    return x + y + z\n\n# Example usage\nx = 10\ny = 20\nz = 30\n\nwrapper(func1, [x])\nresult = wrapper(func2, [x, y, z])\nprint(result)  # This will print the result of func2\n```\n\nIn this updated version, the `wrapper` function uses `*args` to unpack the list and pass its elements as separate arguments to the function `func`. This way, you can call both `func1` and `func2` using the `wrapper` function without modifying the original functions."
