I understand that it is used with methods in a class to get the value of the method, but I'm not sure why it's necessary since I can just call the method like normal. For example, in the following code from the Django docs, what difference does it make if the `@property` decorator is present or not in the `full_name` method?\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass Person(models.Model):\n    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n    birth_date = models.DateField()\n\n    def baby_boomer_status(self):\n        \"Returns the person's baby-boomer status.\"\n        import datetime\n        if self.birth_date < datetime.date(1945, 8, 1):\n            return \"Pre-boomer\"\n        elif self.birth_date < datetime.date(1965, 1, 1):\n            return \"Baby boomer\"\n        else:\n            return \"Post-boomer\"\n\n    @property\n    def full_name(self):\n        \"Returns the person's full name.\"\n        return '%s %s' % (self.first_name, self.last_name)\n```"

        "content": "The `@property` decorator in Python is a built-in decorator that allows you to define methods in a class that can be accessed like attributes. This can make your code more intuitive and cleaner by providing a way to control access to the attributes of a class without changing the interface.\n\nHere's why `@property` might be useful and how it makes a difference:\n\n1. **Attribute-Like Access**: By using `@property`, you can access the method like an attribute. This means you can write `person.full_name` instead of `person.full_name()`. This can make the code more readable and expressive, as it reflects the idea that `full_name` is a property of the `Person` object.\n\n2. **Encapsulation**: Using properties allows you to encapsulate the internal representation of your object. If later you want to change the way the full name is generated (e.g., pulling it from a different database field), you can do so without changing how the `full_name` attribute is accessed. This can be useful for maintaining backward compatibility.\n\n3. **Read-Only Property**: By default, the `@property` decorator makes the method read-only. If you don't specify a setter method, the property cannot be set, which can be useful for derived values like `full_name`. If you need to make a property writable, you can define a setter method with the `@<property_name>.setter` decorator.\n\n4. **Computed Properties**: Properties are great for computed values that depend on other fields in the class. In your example, `full_name` is computed from `first_name` and `last_name`.\n\n5. **Consistency and Validation**: You can add validation logic in the property method to ensure consistency whenever the property is accessed. This can be particularly useful for more complex properties that rely on multiple internal states.\n\nIn summary, the `@property` decorator enhances code readability and maintainability by allowing methods to be accessed like attributes, providing a clean interface for computed or derived values."
