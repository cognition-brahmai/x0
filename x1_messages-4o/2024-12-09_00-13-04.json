        "content": "To write a C++ program that reads a story from a file and generates a summary in markdown format, you can follow these steps. The program will use some basic text processing to identify key sentences and generate a summary. Note that creating a highly accurate summary is challenging without advanced natural language processing, but a basic approach can be implemented.\n\nBelow is a sample C++ program that demonstrates how to achieve this:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <sstream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <string>\n#include <algorithm>\n\n// Function to split a string into sentences\nstd::vector<std::string> splitIntoSentences(const std::string& text) {\n    std::vector<std::string> sentences;\n    std::stringstream stream(text);\n    std::string sentence;\n    while (std::getline(stream, sentence, '.')) {\n        if (!sentence.empty()) {\n            sentences.push_back(sentence + \".\");\n        }\n    }\n    return sentences;\n}\n\n// Function to generate a simple summary based on first few sentences\nstd::string generateSummary(const std::vector<std::string>& sentences, size_t wordLimit) {\n    std::string summary;\n    size_t totalWords = 0;\n\n    for (const auto& sentence : sentences) {\n        std::istringstream wordStream(sentence);\n        size_t wordCount = std::distance(std::istream_iterator<std::string>(wordStream), std::istream_iterator<std::string>());\n        \n        if (totalWords + wordCount <= wordLimit) {\n            summary += sentence + \" \";\n            totalWords += wordCount;\n        } else {\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    return summary;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::ifstream storyFile(\"story.txt\");\n    if (!storyFile.is_open()) {\n        std::cerr << \"Error opening file.\" << std::endl;\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    std::stringstream buffer;\n    buffer << storyFile.rdbuf();\n    storyFile.close();\n\n    std::string story = buffer.str();\n    auto sentences = splitIntoSentences(story);\n    std::string summary = generateSummary(sentences, 100);\n\n    std::ofstream summaryFile(\"summary.md\");\n    if (!summaryFile.is_open()) {\n        std::cerr << \"Error creating summary file.\" << std::endl;\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    summaryFile << \"# Story Summary\\n\\n\" << summary << std::endl;\n    summaryFile.close();\n\n    std::cout << \"Summary generated successfully in summary.md\\n\";\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Reading the Story**: The program reads the entire story from a file named `story.txt`.\n\n2. **Splitting into Sentences**: It splits the story into sentences using the period (`.`) as a delimiter.\n\n3. **Generating Summary**: It constructs a summary by concatenating the first few sentences until the word limit is reached.\n\n4. **Output**: The summary is written to a file named `summary.md` in markdown format with a title.\n\n### Steps to Run:\n\n1. Prepare a text file named `story.txt` containing the story about the alien family.\n2. Compile the C++ program using a C++ compiler, e.g., `g++ -o summary summary.cpp`.\n3. Run the compiled program using `./summary`.\n4. Check the generated `summary.md` file for the output.\n\nThis program provides a basic summary by selecting the initial sentences. For a more nuanced summary, consider using more sophisticated text analysis or machine learning techniques."
