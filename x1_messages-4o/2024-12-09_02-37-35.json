I'm currently doing some unit testing and I need to pass a test when a variable lies between two boundary conditions. For example, I would like to use something similar to the following code:\n\n```python\ndef myTest(self):\n    myInt = 5\n    self.assertBetween(myInt,3,8)\n```\n\nThis would pass the test if `myInt` lies within the range 3 to 8 and fail otherwise. I've checked the list of assert methods in the Python documentation but can't find one that provides this functionality."

        "content": "Python's `unittest` framework does not provide a built-in `assertBetween` method. However, you can easily create a custom assertion method within your test class to achieve this functionality. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\nclass MyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):\n    def assertBetween(self, value, lower, upper, msg=None):\n        \"\"\"Check that value is between lower and upper, inclusive.\"\"\"\n        if not (lower <= value <= upper):\n            standardMsg = f'{value} not between {lower} and {upper}'\n            self.fail(self._formatMessage(msg, standardMsg))\n    \n    def test_example(self):\n        myInt = 5\n        self.assertBetween(myInt, 3, 8)\n\n# Run the test\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\nIn this implementation, `assertBetween` is defined as a method within your test case class, `MyTestCase`. It checks if the `value` is between `lower` and `upper`, inclusive. If not, it raises an assertion error with a meaningful message. You can then use `self.assertBetween()` in your test methods just like any other assertion method."
