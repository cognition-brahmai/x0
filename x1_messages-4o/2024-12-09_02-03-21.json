Here is my code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\nfiddy_states = pd.read_html('https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states')\n\nprint(fiddy_states)\n```\n\nHowever, I'm encountering an error that says `ImportError: lxml not found, please install it`. The error traceback is as follows:\n\n```python\n/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin/python3.6 /Users/user_name/PycharmProjects/PandasTest/Doc3.py\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Users/user_name/PycharmProjects/PandasTest/Doc3.py\", line 9, in &lt;module&gt;\n    fiddy_states = pd.read_html('https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states')\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pandas/io/html.py\", line 906, in read_html\n    keep_default_na=keep_default_na)\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pandas/io/html.py\", line 733, in _parse\n    parser = _parser_dispatch(flav)\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pandas/io/html.py\", line 693, in _parser_dispatch\n    raise ImportError(\"lxml not found, please install it\")\nImportError: lxml not found, please install it\n```\n\nIn Anaconda, it shows that the latest version of lxml (3.8.0) is installed. I've tried to reinstall it using `pip install lxml` and also by downloading the lxml wheel corresponding to my python version (`lxml-3.8.0-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl`), but neither method seems to work. In the second case, I'm getting the error that it is `not a supported wheel on this platform`, despite my Python version being correct (3.6, 64 bits). How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering indicates that the `lxml` library, which is required by `pandas` to parse HTML, is not available in your environment. Even though you mentioned that `lxml` is installed in Anaconda, it seems it's not available in the environment you're using in PyCharm. Here are some steps you can follow to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check the Python Interpreter in PyCharm:**\n   Ensure that the interpreter selected in PyCharm is the one where the `lxml` package is installed. You can check or change the interpreter by going to `File > Settings > Project: <Your Project Name> > Python Interpreter`.\n\n2. **Install `lxml` in the Correct Environment:**\n   If the correct environment is not selected, you can switch to the Anaconda environment if that's where `lxml` is installed. Otherwise, you can install `lxml` in the current environment by running the following command in your terminal or Anaconda prompt:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install lxml\n   ```\n\n   If you're using Anaconda, you might want to use:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda install lxml\n   ```\n\n3. **Ensure You\u2019re Using the Correct Platform-Specific Wheel:**\n   The wheel file you mentioned (`lxml-3.8.0-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl`) is for Windows, while you're on macOS. Make sure you are using the correct command to install packages on macOS, and avoid manually downloading Windows-specific wheels.\n\n4. **Verify Python Path:**\n   In your terminal, run the following command to verify which Python interpreter is being used:\n\n   ```bash\n   which python\n   ```\n\n   Make sure it matches the path used by PyCharm. You can find the Python path used by PyCharm under `Settings` as mentioned above.\n\n5. **Restart PyCharm:**\n   Sometimes a simple restart of PyCharm can refresh the environment settings and resolve any discrepancies.\n\n6. **Virtual Environment:**\n   Consider creating a virtual environment and installing your packages there. This can help avoid conflicts with other installations:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate  # On macOS and Linux\n   # myenv\\Scripts\\activate  # On Windows\n   pip install pandas lxml\n   ```\n\n   Update your PyCharm project to use this new virtual environment.\n\nFollowing these steps should help resolve the issue by ensuring that the `lxml` package is properly installed and recognized in the environment PyCharm is using."
