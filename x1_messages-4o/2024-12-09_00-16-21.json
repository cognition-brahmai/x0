        "content": "To calculate the inverse of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution in Python, you can indeed use the SciPy library, which provides convenient functions for this purpose. Specifically, you can use the `ppf` (percent-point function) from the `scipy.stats.norm` module, which effectively computes the quantile function, or the inverse CDF, of the normal distribution.\n\nHere's how you can do it using SciPy:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\n\n# Parameters for the normal distribution\nmu = 0       # Mean\nsigma = 1    # Standard deviation\n\n# Probability for which you want to find the inverse CDF\np = 0.95\n\n# Calculate the inverse CDF (quantile function)\ninverse_cdf = norm.ppf(p, loc=mu, scale=sigma)\n\nprint(f\"The inverse CDF for probability {p} is: {inverse_cdf}\")\n```\n\nIn this example, `norm.ppf(p, loc=mu, scale=sigma)` calculates the inverse CDF of the normal distribution with mean (`mu`) and standard deviation (`sigma`) for the given probability `p`. The `ppf` function is used to find the value `x` such that the CDF at `x` is equal to `p`.\n\nYou can adjust the `mu` and `sigma` to fit the parameters of your specific normal distribution. SciPy is a well-established library in Python for scientific and mathematical computations, making it a reliable choice for this kind of task."
