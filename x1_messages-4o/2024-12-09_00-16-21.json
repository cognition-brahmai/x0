The solution provided by the author of the book is referred to as O(n). However, I am wondering if the time-complexity of this iterative string append operation is actually O(n^2), or O(n)? Since strings in Python are immutable, does the \"+\" operator allocate the necessary space, copy over the original, and then copy over the appending string when concatenating? If I have a collection of n strings each of length 1, wouldn't it take O(n^2) time? Could someone help me understand how Python handles string appending or direct me to a source where I can find this information?"

        "content": "In Python, strings are indeed immutable, which means that every time you concatenate strings using the `+` operator, a new string is created. This involves allocating space for the new string and copying the content of the original strings into it. Therefore, if you are repeatedly using the `+` operator to build a longer string from smaller strings, the time complexity can indeed end up being O(n^2), because each concatenation step can take linear time relative to the size of the strings being concatenated.\n\nTo elaborate, if you concatenate n strings each of length 1, the first concatenation takes 1 operation, the second takes 2 operations, and so on, up to n operations for the nth concatenation. The sum of the first n integers is (n(n + 1))/2, which simplifies to O(n^2) in terms of time complexity.\n\nFor more efficient string building, it is recommended to use a list to collect all the string parts and then use `''.join(list_of_strings)` to concatenate them all at once. This approach takes advantage of the fact that `join` calculates the final size of the resulting string in advance and performs the concatenation in a single pass, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n).\n\nFor further reading, you can refer to the Python documentation or explore Python's source code, particularly the implementation of the `str` type and the `join` method, to gain more insights into how these operations are handled internally."
