        "content": "I am trying to create buttons in tkinter within a for loop. Each loop passes the count value `i` as an argument to the command value. The intention is to identify which button was pressed based on this value, and perform actions accordingly. However, when I press any of the buttons, the printed value is always `2` - the last iteration. This seems to imply that although the buttons are being created as separate entities, the `i` value in the command arguments seem to be consistent across all buttons. How can I ensure that the current `i` value in each iteration sticks with the corresponding button? Here is the code I have been working with:\n\n```python\ndef createGameURLs(self):\n    self.button = []\n    for i in range(3):\n        self.button.append(Button(self, text='Game '+str(i+1),\n                                  command=lambda: self.open_this(i)))\n        self.button[i].grid(column=4, row=i+1, sticky=W)\n\ndef open_this(self, myNum):\n    print(myNum)\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is a common one when using lambda functions in a loop. The problem arises because the lambda function captures the variable `i` by reference, not by value. By the time the button is pressed, the loop has already completed, and `i` is set to its final value, which is why you always see `2`.\n\nTo solve this issue, you can use a default argument in the lambda function to capture the current value of `i` at each iteration. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef createGameURLs(self):\n    self.button = []\n    for i in range(3):\n        # Use a default argument to capture the current value of i\n        self.button.append(Button(self, text='Game '+str(i+1),\n                                  command=lambda myNum=i: self.open_this(myNum)))\n        self.button[i].grid(column=4, row=i+1, sticky=W)\n\ndef open_this(self, myNum):\n    print(myNum)\n```\n\nIn this code, `myNum=i` is used as a default argument in the lambda function. This captures the current value of `i` during each iteration, ensuring that each button's command has its own distinct value. This way, when a button is pressed, it will correctly print the number associated with that button."
