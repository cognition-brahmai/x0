However, whenever I try to run this, I get the error \"ImportError: No module named IPython\" both when I run this code in a file and in the command line. The error is specifically tied to IPython, not any of its submodules. I have looked at previous questions and answers on this topic, but none of them have solved my problem. How can I fix this error?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering indicates that the `IPython` module is not installed in your Python environment. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Install IPython**: You need to install IPython in your Python environment. Since you're using Python 2.7.13, ensure that you install a version compatible with it. You can use pip to install IPython. Run the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install ipython\n   ```\n\n   If you have multiple versions of Python installed, you may need to specify `pip2` to ensure it installs for Python 2.7:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip2 install ipython\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify Installation**: After installing, you can verify the installation by importing IPython in a Python shell. Open the Python shell by running `python` or `python2` and then type:\n\n   ```python\n   import IPython\n   print(IPython.__version__)\n   ```\n\n   If there's no error, IPython is installed correctly.\n\n3. **Check Python Path**: Ensure that the Python environment you are using is the one where IPython is installed. Sometimes, the IDE or command line might use a different Python environment. You can check the Python path by running:\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   print(sys.executable)\n   ```\n\n   Make sure it points to the Python 2.7.13 interpreter where you installed IPython.\n\n4. **Virtual Environment**: If you're working within a virtual environment, make sure it's activated before running your script or installing packages. You can activate it using:\n\n   ```bash\n   source /path/to/your/venv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n5. **Alternative**: If you continue facing issues, consider upgrading to a more recent version of Python, such as Python 3.x, where you might have fewer compatibility issues and can access more updated libraries.\n\nOnce IPython is installed and correctly set up in your environment, you should be able to run your script without encountering the import error."
