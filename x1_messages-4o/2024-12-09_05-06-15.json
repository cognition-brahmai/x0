According to the Django documentation, I should put a flag on my AppConfig classes to prevent the re-running code which should be executed only once. However, the print statement in my code still executes twice, despite adding a flag. Here is my current code:\n\n```python\nfrom django.apps import AppConfig\nimport app.mqtt\nfrom apscheduler.schedulers.background import BackgroundScheduler\n\nclass MyAppConfig(AppConfig):\n    name = 'app'\n    verbose_name = \"HomeIoT\"\n    run_already = False\n\n    def ready(self):\n        if MyAppConfig.run_already: return\n        MyAppConfig.run_already = True\n        print(\"Hello\")\n```"

        "content": "In Django, the `AppConfig.ready()` method can be called multiple times, especially during testing or when the application is loaded multiple times in different contexts. To ensure that your code runs only once, even if `ready()` is called multiple times, using a class-level flag like `run_already` is a common approach. However, if you find that the method is still executing twice, it may be due to multiple instances of your application configuration being created or other factors such as the application's initialization process.\n\nHere are a few strategies to ensure that your code within the `ready()` method runs only once:\n\n1. **Check for Multiple App Instances**: \n   Ensure that your application is not being instantiated more than once. This can happen if there are multiple configurations or if the application is included in multiple INSTALLED_APPS entries.\n\n2. **Use a Singleton Pattern**:\n   Ensure that any code that should only execute once is wrapped in a singleton pattern or managed by a global state that isn't reset across different instances.\n\n3. **Use Django's Signal System**:\n   You can move your initialization code to a Django signal handler. For example, you can connect a function to the `django.db.models.signals.post_migrate` signal, which runs after all migrations have been applied.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement a more reliable singleton pattern using a module-level flag instead of a class-level flag:\n\n```python\nfrom django.apps import AppConfig\nimport app.mqtt\nfrom apscheduler.schedulers.background import BackgroundScheduler\n\n# Module-level flag\nis_initialized = False\n\nclass MyAppConfig(AppConfig):\n    name = 'app'\n    verbose_name = \"HomeIoT\"\n\n    def ready(self):\n        global is_initialized\n        if is_initialized:\n            return\n        is_initialized = True\n\n        # Your initialization code here\n        print(\"Hello\")\n\n        # Example: Starting a background task\n        scheduler = BackgroundScheduler()\n        # Add your jobs to the scheduler\n        # scheduler.add_job(your_job_function, 'interval', minutes=1)\n        scheduler.start()\n```\n\nBy using a module-level flag like `is_initialized`, you avoid issues that may arise with multiple instances of the `AppConfig` class. This approach ensures that the `ready()` method's logic is executed only once across the application's lifecycle."
