However, the resulting feature names from the encoder are in the format 'x0_female', 'x0_male', 'x1_0.0', 'x1_15.0', etc. Is there a way to instruct the OneHotEncoder to create feature names such that the column name appears at the beginning? I am looking for output similar to what Pandas' get_dummies() function produces, like 'Sex_female', 'AgeGroup_15.0', etc. Here is the code I am currently using:\n\n```python\ntrain_X = pd.DataFrame({'Sex':['male', 'female']*3, 'AgeGroup':[0,15,30,45,60,75]})\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder\nencoder = OneHotEncoder()\ntrain_X_encoded = encoder.fit_transform(train_X[['Sex', 'AgeGroup']])\nencoder.get_feature_names()\n```\n\nThe output of the get_feature_names() method is as follows:\n\n```python\narray(['x0_female', 'x0_male', 'x1_0.0', 'x1_15.0', 'x1_30.0', 'x1_45.0', 'x1_60.0', 'x1_75.0'], dtype=object)\n```"

        "content": "To customize the feature names generated by `OneHotEncoder` so they include the original column names, you can use the `get_feature_names_out()` method from the encoder after fitting it. This method allows you to specify the input feature names so that the resulting feature names are more descriptive.\n\nHere's how you can achieve that:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder\n\n# Your data\ntrain_X = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Sex': ['male', 'female']*3,\n    'AgeGroup': [0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75]\n})\n\n# Initialize the OneHotEncoder\nencoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False)\n\n# Fit and transform the data\ntrain_X_encoded = encoder.fit_transform(train_X)\n\n# Get more descriptive feature names\nfeature_names = encoder.get_feature_names_out(input_features=train_X.columns)\n\n# Convert the encoded data to a DataFrame with the new feature names\ntrain_X_encoded_df = pd.DataFrame(train_X_encoded, columns=feature_names)\n\n# Display the result\nprint(train_X_encoded_df)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `sparse=False` is used to ensure the output is a dense array, which is easier to convert to a DataFrame.\n- `get_feature_names_out(input_features=train_X.columns)` uses the column names from the original DataFrame to generate more meaningful feature names.\n- The resulting DataFrame `train_X_encoded_df` will have columns named like `'Sex_female'`, `'Sex_male'`, `'AgeGroup_0.0'`, etc., similar to the output from `pd.get_dummies()`."
