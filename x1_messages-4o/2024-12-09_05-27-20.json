If I have a program like this:\n\n```\ndef threadfunc():\n    while True:\n        time.sleep(1)\n\nthreading.Thread(target=threadfunc).start()\n```\n\nWill it ever finish, even after the main thread finishes its execution? And what about this program:\n\n```\ndef threadfunc():\n    while True:\n        time.sleep(1)\n\nth = threading.Thread(target=threadfunc)\nth.daemon = True\nth.start()\n```\n\nWill it finish immediately after the main thread has completed execution? I am asking this because in my main thread I am calling sys.exit(), but the process just hangs and my other threads are running, as I can see from the log. Does this have anything to do with sys.exit() being called while other threads are still alive?"

        "content": "In Python, the concept of daemon threads is used to determine whether a thread should keep running or be terminated when the main program exits.\n\n### Normal Threads vs Daemon Threads\n\n1. **Normal Threads:**\n   - A normal thread (non-daemon) will keep the program running as long as it is alive. This means that if you have a normal thread running, the program will not exit until this thread has finished its execution, even if the main thread has completed.\n   - In your first program example:\n     ```python\n     def threadfunc():\n         while True:\n             time.sleep(1)\n\n     threading.Thread(target=threadfunc).start()\n     ```\n     This creates a normal thread. Since the thread is running an infinite loop, it will keep the program running indefinitely, even after the main thread has finished.\n\n2. **Daemon Threads:**\n   - A daemon thread runs in the background and does not prevent the program from exiting. When all non-daemon threads have finished, the program will terminate, and any remaining daemon threads will be abruptly stopped.\n   - In your second program example:\n     ```python\n     def threadfunc():\n         while True:\n             time.sleep(1)\n\n     th = threading.Thread(target=threadfunc)\n     th.daemon = True\n     th.start()\n     ```\n     This creates a daemon thread. Once the main thread completes its execution, the program will terminate, regardless of whether the daemon thread is still running or not.\n\n### Impact of `sys.exit()`\n\n`sys.exit()` raises a `SystemExit` exception, which can terminate the main thread. However, if there are other non-daemon threads still running, the program will not exit until those threads have also finished. If these threads are in infinite loops and are not set as daemon threads, the program will appear to \"hang\" because it is waiting for them to finish.\n\nIn your case, if you want the program to exit cleanly and immediately after the main thread finishes (or calls `sys.exit()`), you should ensure that any long-running or infinite-loop threads are set as daemon threads. This way, they will not block the program from exiting."
