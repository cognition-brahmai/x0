I have the following JSON data that I'm pulling from a CouchDB record:\n\n```\n\"{\\\"description\\\":\\\"fdsafsa\\\",\\\"order\\\":\\\"1\\\",\\\"place\\\":\\\"22 Plainsman Rd, Mississauga, ON, Canada\\\",\\\"lat\\\":43.5969175,\\\"lng\\\":-79.7248744,\\\"locationDate\\\":\\\"03/24/2010\\\"},{\\\"description\\\":\\\"sadfdsa\\\",\\\"order\\\":\\\"2\\\",\\\"place\\\":\\\"50 Dawnridge Trail, Brampton, ON, Canada\\\",\\\"lat\\\":43.7304774,\\\"lng\\\":-79.8055435,\\\"locationDate\\\":\\\"03/26/2010\\\"},\"\n```\n\nThis data is stored inside a Python dictionary under the key 'locations' in a dictionary called 'my_plan'. I'm trying to convert this data into a Python dictionary so I can iterate through it in a Django template as follows:\n\n```\n{% for location in my_plan.locations %}                                                           \n<tr>\n    <td>{{ location.place }}</td>\n    <td>{{ location.locationDate }}</td>\n</tr>\n\n{% endfor %}\n```\n\nI've found a lot of information on converting dictionaries to JSON, but not the other way around."

        "content": "To convert JSON data into a Python dictionary, you can use Python's built-in `json` module, which provides functionalities to parse JSON strings into Python data structures. In your case, it looks like you have a JSON string that represents a list of dictionaries. Here's how you can convert it:\n\n1. First, ensure that the JSON string is formatted correctly. It seems like your JSON data consists of multiple JSON objects separated by commas, but they are not enclosed in a list. You need to wrap them in square brackets `[]` to make them a valid JSON array.\n\n2. Use the `json.loads()` function to parse the JSON string into a Python list of dictionaries.\n\nHere's how you can do that:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Your JSON data as a string\njson_data = \"[{\\\"description\\\":\\\"fdsafsa\\\",\\\"order\\\":\\\"1\\\",\\\"place\\\":\\\"22 Plainsman Rd, Mississauga, ON, Canada\\\",\\\"lat\\\":43.5969175,\\\"lng\\\":-79.7248744,\\\"locationDate\\\":\\\"03/24/2010\\\"},{\\\"description\\\":\\\"sadfdsa\\\",\\\"order\\\":\\\"2\\\",\\\"place\\\":\\\"50 Dawnridge Trail, Brampton, ON, Canada\\\",\\\"lat\\\":43.7304774,\\\"lng\\\":-79.8055435,\\\"locationDate\\\":\\\"03/26/2010\\\"}]\"\n\n# Parse the JSON string into a Python list of dictionaries\nlocations_list = json.loads(json_data)\n\n# Assign this list to the 'locations' key in the 'my_plan' dictionary\nmy_plan = {'locations': locations_list}\n\n# Now you can iterate through 'my_plan.locations' in your Django template\n```\n\nWith this setup, your Django template code should work as expected, iterating over each location and displaying the `place` and `locationDate` fields.\n\nMake sure that your JSON string is correctly formatted before attempting to parse it. If your data source provides the JSON in a different format, you may need to adjust the string accordingly."
