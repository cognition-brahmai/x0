Following the example from the matplotlib documentation, I wrote the following code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nfor i, label in enumerate(('A', 'B', 'C', 'D')):\n    ax = fig.add_subplot(2,2,i+1)\n    ax.text(0.05, 0.95, label, transform=ax.transAxes,\n      fontsize=16, fontweight='bold', va='top')\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nHowever, the labels appear to be in normal weight, not bold as I expected. In addition, I am getting a UserWarning as follows:\n\n```python\nWarning (from warnings module):\nFile \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\font_manager.py\", line 1228\nUserWarning)\nUserWarning: findfont: Could not match :family=Bitstream Vera Sans:style=italic:variant=normal:weight=bold:stretch=normal:size=x-small. Returning C:\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\mpl-data\\fonts\\ttf\\Vera.ttf\n```\n\nHow can I resolve this warning and get the labels to display in bold as intended?"

        "content": "The warning you're encountering suggests that Matplotlib is having trouble finding a font that matches the specified style and weight, which is why the labels are not displaying in bold. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Install Necessary Fonts:**\n   Ensure that you have the necessary fonts installed on your system. The warning indicates that Matplotlib is trying to use the \"Bitstream Vera Sans\" family. You can either install this font or configure Matplotlib to use a different font that is available on your system.\n\n2. **Specify a Different Font:**\n   You can explicitly specify a different font family that you know is available on your system. For example:\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n   import numpy as np\n\n   fig = plt.figure()\n   for i, label in enumerate(('A', 'B', 'C', 'D')):\n       ax = fig.add_subplot(2, 2, i + 1)\n       ax.text(0.05, 0.95, label, transform=ax.transAxes,\n               fontsize=16, fontweight='bold', va='top', family='sans-serif')\n   \n   plt.show()\n   ```\n\n3. **Use Font Configuration:**\n   If you have a specific font in mind, you can configure Matplotlib to use it by default. You can do this by modifying the `matplotlibrc` file or using the `rcParams` within your script:\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib as mpl\n\n   mpl.rcParams['font.family'] = 'sans-serif'\n   mpl.rcParams['font.sans-serif'] = ['Arial']  # Replace 'Arial' with any available font\n\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n   import numpy as np\n\n   fig = plt.figure()\n   for i, label in enumerate(('A', 'B', 'C', 'D')):\n       ax = fig.add_subplot(2, 2, i + 1)\n       ax.text(0.05, 0.95, label, transform=ax.transAxes,\n               fontsize=16, fontweight='bold', va='top')\n\n   plt.show()\n   ```\n\n4. **Check Matplotlib Version:**\n   Ensure that your Matplotlib version is up to date. Older versions may have different font management that could cause these issues. You can update Matplotlib using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade matplotlib\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the warning and get your labels to display in bold as intended."
