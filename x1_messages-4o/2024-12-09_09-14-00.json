        "content": "Certainly! You can easily count the number of even numbers in a list using a simple algorithm in Python. Here's a step-by-step guide and the corresponding code:\n\n### Algorithm:\n\n1. **Initialize a Counter:** Start with a counter set to zero. This will keep track of the number of even numbers.\n2. **Iterate Through the List:** Loop over each number in the list.\n3. **Check if the Number is Even:** For each number, use the modulus operator `%` to determine if the number is even. A number is even if `number % 2 == 0`.\n4. **Increment the Counter:** If the number is even, increment the counter by one.\n5. **Return the Counter:** After the loop, the counter will hold the total number of even numbers.\n\n### Python Code:\n\n```python\ndef count_even_numbers(numbers):\n    even_count = 0  # Initialize the counter\n    for number in numbers:  # Iterate through each number in the list\n        if number % 2 == 0:  # Check if the number is even\n            even_count += 1  # Increment the counter if it's even\n    return even_count  # Return the total count of even numbers\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\neven_count = count_even_numbers(numbers_list)\nprint(\"Number of even numbers:\", even_count)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`even_count = 0`** initializes a counter to keep track of even numbers.\n- **`for number in numbers:`** goes through each number in the list.\n- **`if number % 2 == 0:`** checks if the current number is even.\n- **`even_count += 1`** increments the counter whenever an even number is found.\n- Finally, **`return even_count`** provides the total count of even numbers in the list.\n\nYou can test this function with different lists to see how it works!"
