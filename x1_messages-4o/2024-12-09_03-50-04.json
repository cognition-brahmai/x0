        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that there is an architecture mismatch between the wxPython binary you installed and the Python interpreter you are using. This commonly happens when the binary is compiled for a different architecture (e.g., 32-bit vs 64-bit) than what your Python interpreter supports.\n\nHere are steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Python Architecture**: First, determine the architecture of your Python installation. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   file /usr/local/bin/python2.7\n   ```\n\n   Look for either \"i386\" (32-bit) or \"x86_64\" (64-bit) in the output.\n\n2. **Verify wxPython Architecture**: Ensure that the wxPython package you installed matches the architecture of your Python installation. The error message suggests a mismatch, so you might need to download the correct wxPython binary.\n\n3. **Install the Correct Version**:\n   - If your Python is 64-bit, you must ensure that you have a 64-bit version of wxPython. wxPython 2.8 might not have a 64-bit version compatible with Python 2.7 on your system, so you may need to switch to a later version if possible, or ensure your Python is 32-bit if that's the only available wxPython version.\n   - Consider installing wxPython via `pip` if it's available. First, uninstall the existing wxPython:\n\n     ```bash\n     sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/wxPython-unicode-2.8.12.1\n     ```\n\n   - Then, try installing using pip:\n\n     ```bash\n     pip install wxpython\n     ```\n\n   Note: wxPython Phoenix (a newer version of wxPython) may not support Python 2.7 on Mac OS 10.7, so you may need to stick with an older version compatible with your system.\n\n4. **Use a Virtual Environment**: If you continue to face issues, consider setting up a virtual environment to isolate your Python setup:\n\n   ```bash\n   python2.7 -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n   pip install wxpython\n   ```\n\n5. **Consider Upgrading**: If you are still unable to resolve the issue, consider upgrading your operating system or Python to a more recent version, as wxPython and Python 2.7 support might be limited on older systems like Mac OS 10.7.\n\nBy aligning the architecture of wxPython with your Python installation, you should be able to resolve the ImportError you are experiencing."
