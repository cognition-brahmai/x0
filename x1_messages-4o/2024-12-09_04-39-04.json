        "content": "I am using batch normalization and dropout in TensorFlow, specifically with contrib.layers. I am concerned about the order of using these two. If I use dropout followed by batch normalization, it seems like it might cause issues. For instance, if the shift in the batch normalization is trained to the larger scale numbers of the training outputs, but then the same shift is applied to smaller scale numbers without dropout during testing, it seems like the shift could be off. Does the TensorFlow batch normalization layer automatically compensate for this? Are there other pitfalls to look out for when using these two together? Could there be issues with using both batch normalization and dropout on multiple successive layers? Also, I have conducted an experimental test which seems to suggest that the order of these two does matter. When the dropout is before the batch normalization, the validation loss seems to be going up as the training loss is going down. When the order is reversed, both are going down. However, my observations are based on slow movements and only one test. I would appreciate a more definitive and informed answer."

        "content": "When using batch normalization and dropout together in neural networks, the order in which you apply them can indeed have a significant impact on the model's performance. Let's break down the considerations and potential pitfalls:\n\n1. **Order of Application:**\n   - **Batch Normalization before Dropout:** This is generally the preferred order. Batch normalization normalizes the output of a layer, and dropout then randomly drops some of these normalized activations. This sequence helps maintain the distributional properties of the batch-normalized activations even with dropout.\n   - **Dropout before Batch Normalization:** This can lead to issues as you noticed. The randomness introduced by dropout can interfere with the stable statistics that batch normalization tries to maintain, potentially leading to suboptimal learning and convergence issues, especially during testing when dropout is not applied.\n\n2. **Batch Normalization's Compensation:**\n   - Batch normalization maintains a moving average of the mean and variance of the activations during training, which it uses during inference. This helps stabilize the training by normalizing the inputs to a layer. However, if dropout significantly alters the scale of inputs, this compensation might be less effective.\n\n3. **Pitfalls of Using Both Together:**\n   - **Overfitting:** While both dropout and batch normalization are regularization techniques, using them excessively can lead to underfitting. It's crucial to balance their usage.\n   - **Learning Rate Sensitivity:** Batch normalization can allow for higher learning rates, which might not pair well with dropout. You might need to adjust the learning rate when using both.\n   - **Multiple Successive Layers:** If using both techniques across multiple layers, consider alternating their usage or adjusting their parameters to avoid excessive regularization.\n\n4. **Empirical Observations:**\n   - Your experimental observation is consistent with common findings. When dropout is applied before batch normalization, the model may not learn effectively due to the disrupted statistics that batch normalization tries to learn.\n\n5. **Recommendations:**\n   - Experiment with different configurations. Generally, try applying batch normalization before dropout.\n   - Monitor both training and validation losses closely. If you notice a divergence as in your experiment, re-evaluate the order or hyperparameters.\n   - Consider using other regularization techniques or architectural changes if issues persist.\n\nIn summary, while TensorFlow's batch normalization does compensate for scale changes to some extent, applying dropout before it can still disrupt the learning process. Thus, the order does matter, and it's typically beneficial to apply batch normalization before dropout."
