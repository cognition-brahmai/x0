My \"run.py\" and \"test.py\" files are standard, and they both import the app from \"atcatalog\". I have tried to find a way to omit the virtual environment directory from coverage but have not found any solutions. How can I prevent Python coverage from including my virtual environment site packages in its testing?"

        "content": "To prevent Python coverage from including your virtual environment's site packages in its testing, you need to properly configure your coverage tool to ignore those directories. Here are a few steps you can follow to achieve this:\n\n1. **Check the Coverage Configuration File:**\n\n   If you haven't already, create a `.coveragerc` file in the root of your project directory. This file allows you to specify settings for the coverage tool, including which files or directories to omit from coverage reports.\n\n2. **Configure the Omit Section:**\n\n   Add the following configuration to your `.coveragerc` file to tell coverage to ignore specific directories:\n\n   ```ini\n   [run]\n   omit =\n       */site-packages/*\n       */your-virtualenv-name/*\n   ```\n\n   Replace `your-virtualenv-name` with the actual name of your virtual environment directory.\n\n3. **Use Relative Paths:**\n\n   Ensure that your paths in the `.coveragerc` file are correct and that they match the directory structure of your project. You can also use absolute paths if that's more reliable for your setup.\n\n4. **Exclude Specific Files or Directories:**\n\n   If there are additional files or directories you want to exclude, you can add them to the `omit` list in your `.coveragerc` file. You can use wildcards (`*`) to specify patterns.\n\n5. **Re-run Coverage:**\n\n   After updating the `.coveragerc` file, run your coverage command again to see if the virtual environment files are excluded. Typically, you would run:\n\n   ```bash\n   coverage run test.py\n   coverage report\n   ```\n\n6. **Verify Exclusions:**\n\n   Check the coverage report to ensure that the virtual environment files and directories are not included in the coverage analysis.\n\n7. **Alternative Method:**\n\n   If you're using a command-line execution, you can also specify the omit option directly like this:\n\n   ```bash\n   coverage run --omit=\"*/site-packages/*,*/your-virtualenv-name/*\" test.py\n   ```\n\n   Replace `your-virtualenv-name` with the actual path of your virtual environment directory.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to exclude your virtual environment directories from the coverage analysis, focusing only on your project's source files."
