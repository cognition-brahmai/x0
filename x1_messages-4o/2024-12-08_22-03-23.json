Here's how you can modify the code to calculate the average, minimum, and maximum prices for each make and model:\n\n```r\n# Load the dataset\ncars <- read.csv(\"cars.csv\")\n\n# Define a custom function to calculate mean, min, and max\ncalculate_statistics <- function(x) {\n  c(average = mean(x), minimum = min(x), maximum = max(x))\n}\n\n# Calculate the statistics by make and model\nresult <- aggregate(price ~ make + model, data = cars, FUN = calculate_statistics)\n\n# Convert the result into a more readable format\nresult_df <- do.call(data.frame, result)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result_df)\n```\n\nThis code uses a custom function, `calculate_statistics`, to compute the average, minimum, and maximum prices. The `do.call` function is used to convert the output of `aggregate` into a more readable data frame format."
