        "content": "To launch a script in a distinct console window on Windows using `subprocess.Popen()`, you can use the `START` command through the Windows command shell. This can be done by setting `shell=True` and providing the appropriate command string. Here\u2019s an example of how you can do this:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\n# The script you want to run\nscript_path = \"path_to_your_script.py\"\n\nsubprocess.Popen(\n    ['cmd', '/c', 'start', 'python', script_path],\n    shell=True\n)\n```\n\nThis will open a new console window and run your script in it. Here's a breakdown of the command:\n\n- `cmd` is the Windows command interpreter.\n- `/c` tells `cmd` to execute the command that follows and then terminate.\n- `start` is a command that opens a new command prompt window to run the specified program or command.\n- `python` is the command to run the Python interpreter. Make sure that the Python executable is in your system's PATH.\n- `script_path` is the path to the Python script you want to execute.\n\nMake sure to replace `path_to_your_script.py` with the actual path to your script. This approach should help you achieve your goal of running the script in a new console window on a Windows system."
