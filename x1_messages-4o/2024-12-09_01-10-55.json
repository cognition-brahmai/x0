For instance, when I try inserting list 'k' into list 'a' using the following code:\n\n```python\na = ['foo.py']\nk = ['nice', '-n', '10'] \na.insert(0, k)\nprint(a)\n```\nThe output is `[['nice', '-n', '10'], 'foo.py']` but I want the elements of list 'k' to be on the same level as 'foo.py', not as a sublist."

        "content": "To achieve the desired outcome where the elements of list `k` are inserted at the front of list `a` as individual elements rather than as a sublist, you can use slicing to modify the list `a`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\na = ['foo.py']\nk = ['nice', '-n', '10']\n\n# Insert elements of k at the beginning of a\na[:0] = k\n\nprint(a)\n```\n\nThis code uses slicing (`a[:0] = k`) to insert the elements of list `k` at the start of list `a`. The slicing operation `a[:0]` specifies the position at the start of the list `a`, and assigning `k` to this slice effectively splices the elements of `k` into `a` at the specified position. The result will be:\n\n```\n['nice', '-n', '10', 'foo.py']\n```\n\nThis way, the elements of `k` are inserted into `a` at the same level as `'foo.py'`."
