You can use popular resources like Google Maps, TripAdvisor, or Yelp to get current recommendations based on your location and preferences.\n\nAs for your JavaScript function, you already have a good implementation for randomly selecting a restaurant. Here's the code you provided, packaged neatly:\n\n```javascript\nconst restaurants = [\n  \"The Spotted Pig\",\n  \"Katz's Delicatessen\",\n  \"Joe's Pizza\",\n  \"Russ & Daughters\",\n  \"Shake Shack\",\n  \"Momofuku Noodle Bar\",\n  \"Levain Bakery\",\n  \"Gramercy Tavern\",\n  \"Carbone\",\n  \"Marea\"\n];\n\nfunction suggestRestaurant(restaurants) {\n  const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * restaurants.length);\n  return restaurants[randomIndex];\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconsole.log(suggestRestaurant(restaurants));\n```\n\nThis function will return a random restaurant from the list each time you call it. You can test it by running it multiple times to see different suggestions. If you want to specify a city, just let me know, and I can help you further."
