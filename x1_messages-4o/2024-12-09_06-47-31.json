Now, I need to measure the similarity between two unknown documents that were not in the training data. I have vectors for the two documents but I am unable to find a method in the gensim API that works for me as most of them are expecting TaggedDocument. Is there a way to compare the feature vectors value by value to ascertain the similarity of the texts? Here's the code I have so far:\n\n```python\nd2v_model = doc2vec.Doc2Vec.load(model_file)\n\nstring1 = 'this is some random paragraph'\nstring2 = 'this is another random paragraph'\n\nvec1 = d2v_model.infer_vector(string1.split())\nvec2 = d2v_model.infer_vector(string2.split())\n```\n\nIn the above code, vec1 and vec2 are successfully initialized to some values and are of size - 'vector_size'."

        "content": "To compare the similarity between two document vectors that you have inferred using a Gensim Doc2Vec model, you can use a similarity measure such as cosine similarity. Cosine similarity is a common choice for comparing vectors because it measures the cosine of the angle between them, which is a good indicator of their similarity in the vector space.\n\nHere's how you can compute the cosine similarity between `vec1` and `vec2`:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.spatial.distance import cosine\n\n# Calculate cosine similarity\ncosine_similarity = 1 - cosine(vec1, vec2)\n\nprint(f\"Cosine Similarity: {cosine_similarity}\")\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, `scipy.spatial.distance.cosine` computes the cosine distance between the two vectors, which is then subtracted from 1 to get the cosine similarity. The cosine distance is defined as `1 - cosine_similarity`, so subtracting it from 1 gives you the desired similarity measure directly.\n\nThe cosine similarity will range from -1 to 1, where:\n- 1 indicates that the vectors are identical.\n- 0 indicates no similarity (orthogonal vectors).\n- -1 indicates completely opposite vectors.\n\nThis method should work well for your task of comparing the similarity between the two inferred document vectors."
