        "content": "When I use keras's binary_crossentropy as the loss function, which calls tensorflow's sigmoid_cross_entropy, it appears to produce loss values only in the range [0, 1]. However, looking at the equation itself,\n\n```python\n# The logistic loss formula from above is\n#   x - x * z + log(1 + exp(-x))\n# For x < 0, a more numerically stable formula is\n#   -x * z + log(1 + exp(x))\n# Note that these two expressions can be combined into the following:\n#   max(x, 0) - x * z + log(1 + exp(-abs(x)))\n# To allow computing gradients at zero, we define custom versions of max and\n# abs functions.\nzeros = array_ops.zeros_like(logits, dtype=logits.dtype)\ncond = (logits >= zeros)\nrelu_logits = array_ops.where(cond, logits, zeros)\nneg_abs_logits = array_ops.where(cond, -logits, logits)\nreturn math_ops.add(\n    relu_logits - logits * labels,\n    math_ops.log1p(math_ops.exp(neg_abs_logits)), name=name)\n```\n\nIt appears that the range should be [0, infinity). Is Tensorflow implementing some type of clipping that I'm not spotting? Additionally, as it uses math_ops.add(), I would predict it would definitely be greater than 1. Can I be sure that the loss range can surpass 1?"

        "content": "The behavior you are observing can be explained by understanding how the `binary_crossentropy` (or `sigmoid_cross_entropy`) loss function works in practice and how it is typically used.\n\n### Theoretical Understanding:\n\nThe binary cross-entropy loss is designed to measure the difference between two probability distributions\u2014in this case, the true labels and the predicted probabilities. The loss function is indeed defined as:\n\n\\[ \\text{loss} = \\max(x, 0) - x \\cdot z + \\log(1 + \\exp(-|x|)) \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( x \\) is the predicted logit.\n- \\( z \\) is the true label (0 or 1).\n\nThe theoretical range of the binary cross-entropy loss is indeed \\([0, \\infty)\\) because the loss increases as the predicted probability diverges from the actual label.\n\n### Why It Seems to Be \\([0, 1]\\):\n\n1. **Normalized Inputs**: If your inputs (after passing through a sigmoid activation) are mostly close to 0 or 1, and your labels are binary, the individual losses for each sample may often be less than 1, especially if your model is performing well. The loss values can accumulate to provide an average loss that looks like it\u2019s within a 0 to 1 range.\n\n2. **Average Loss**: The loss value that you see is usually an average of the loss over all samples in the batch. If your batch is large and your model predictions are mostly accurate, this average can often be less than 1.\n\n3. **Logarithmic Nature**: The logarithmic component \\(\\log(1 + \\exp(-|x|))\\) can mitigate the value, especially when predictions are confident, i.e., logits are large positive or large negative values.\n\n### Can the Loss Surpass 1?\n\n- **Yes**, the loss for individual samples can certainly be greater than 1, especially if your model makes poor predictions (e.g., predicting a probability close to 0 for a true label of 1 or vice versa). In such cases, the logarithmic term and the linear components can result in higher loss values.\n\n- **Batch Loss**: The reported loss (e.g., during training or evaluation) is often averaged over the batch, which might give the impression that the loss is capped at 1, especially when the model is performing well.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe observed behavior of loss values being typically within [0, 1] during training is a result of the average and the natural behavior of well-trained models. However, the theoretical range of the binary cross-entropy loss is indeed \\([0, \\infty)\\), and individual sample losses can exceed 1. There is no inherent clipping to the loss value in TensorFlow's implementation."
