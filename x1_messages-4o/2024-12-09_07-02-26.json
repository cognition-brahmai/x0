        "content": "When does the function `socket.recv(recv_size)` return in Python? From my tests, I have concluded that it will return in the following three cases:\n\n1. After the connection was closed. For example, when the client side calls `socket.close()` or any socket error occurs, it returns an empty string.\n2. When some data arrives, and the size of the data is greater than `recv_size`.\n3. When some data arrives, the size of the data is less than `recv_size` and no more data comes after a short time (I found 0.1s would work).\n\nTo elaborate on my third point, consider the following two scripts:\n\nFor server.py:\n```\nwhile True:\n    data = sock.recv(10)\n    print data, 'EOF'\n```\n\nAnd for client1.py:\n```\nsock.sendall(\"12345\")\nsock.sendall(\"a\" * 50)\n```\n\nAnd for client2.py:\n```\nsock.sendall(\"12345\")\ntime.sleep(0.1)\nsock.sendall(\"a\" * 50)\n```\n\nWhen I run client1.py, server.py outputs:\n```\n12345aaaaa EOF\naaaaaaaaaa EOF\naaaaaaaaaa EOF\naaaaaaaaaa EOF\naaaaaaaaaa EOF\naaaaa EOF\n```\n\nAnd when I run client2.py, server.py outputs:\n```\n12345 EOF\naaaaaaaaaa EOF\naaaaaaaaaa EOF\naaaaaaaaaa EOF\naaaaaaaaaa EOF\naaaaaaaaaa EOF\n```\n\nAre these conclusions correct? Where can I find the official documentation related to my third point?"

        "content": "Your observations about the behavior of `socket.recv(recv_size)` in Python are mostly correct, but the third point requires some clarification. Let's break down each of your points:\n\n1. **Connection Closure**: When the connection is closed, `recv()` will indeed return an empty string. This is the standard behavior when the remote side of the socket has performed an orderly shutdown.\n\n2. **Data Arrival Greater Than `recv_size`**: If the incoming data is larger than the buffer size specified in `recv_size`, `recv()` will return as soon as the buffer is filled with data.\n\n3. **Data Arrival Less Than `recv_size`**: The behavior you're observing, where `recv()` returns even if the data is less than `recv_size`, can be attributed to the way TCP sockets work. TCP is a stream protocol, meaning it doesn't preserve message boundaries and can return as soon as any amount of data is available. The function `recv()` will return as soon as there's any data to be read, and if the connection is non-blocking, it may return with whatever data is available at the moment.\n\nThe reason you're seeing different outputs between `client1.py` and `client2.py` is due to the timing and the way the TCP stack handles the buffered data. In `client2.py`, the `time.sleep(0.1)` allows the socket buffer to be flushed, resulting in `recv()` returning the available data immediately, even if it's less than `recv_size`.\n\nThis behavior is not explicitly documented in the Python documentation, but it aligns with the general understanding of how TCP sockets operate. You can refer to the [Python socket documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html) for general socket behavior, but for a deeper understanding, it's beneficial to look into TCP/IP protocol behavior, as `recv()` directly interacts with the underlying TCP stack.\n\nIf you need to ensure that a specific amount of data is received, you may need to implement additional logic to keep reading from the socket until the desired amount of data has been received."
