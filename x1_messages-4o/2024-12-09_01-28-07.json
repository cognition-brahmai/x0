        "content": "In Python, there isn't a direct equivalent to Java's `final` keyword that can be used to prevent a method from being overridden in a subclass. However, you can achieve similar behavior using a couple of techniques:\n\n1. **Name Mangling**: By using name mangling, you can make it more difficult (but not impossible) to override a method. This is done by prefixing the method name with double underscores (`__`). This makes the method name unique to its class.\n\n   ```python\n   class Base:\n       def __final_method(self):\n           print(\"This is a final method\")\n\n       def call_final_method(self):\n           self.__final_method()\n\n   class Derived(Base):\n       def __final_method(self):  # This does not override Base's __final_method\n           print(\"Trying to override\")\n\n   obj = Derived()\n   obj.call_final_method()  # This will call Base's __final_method\n   ```\n\n   Note that this doesn't truly prevent overriding; it just makes it more difficult.\n\n2. **Using a Custom Decorator**: You can create a custom decorator to raise an error if an attempt is made to override the method.\n\n   ```python\n   def final_method(method):\n       method.__is_final__ = True\n       return method\n\n   class BaseMeta(type):\n       def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):\n           for attr_name, attr_value in dct.items():\n               if callable(attr_value) and getattr(attr_value, '__is_final__', False):\n                   for base in bases:\n                       if hasattr(base, attr_name):\n                           raise TypeError(f\"Cannot override final method '{attr_name}'\")\n           return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)\n\n   class Base(metaclass=BaseMeta):\n       @final_method\n       def final_method(self):\n           print(\"This is a final method\")\n\n   class Derived(Base):\n       def final_method(self):  # This will raise a TypeError\n           print(\"Trying to override\")\n\n   # Attempting to create an instance of Derived will raise an error\n   ```\n\nThese methods aren't foolproof, but they can help enforce a \"final\" behavior in your classes."
