        "content": "To achieve your goal of first fetching the top 30 authors with the highest score and then ordering them by their `last_name`, you can utilize Django's QuerySet capabilities. Here's a step-by-step approach to accomplish this:\n\n1. **Fetch the Top 30 Authors by Score:**\n   You can start by querying the top 30 authors ordered by score in descending order.\n\n2. **Reorder the Result by Last Name:**\n   Since slicing a QuerySet (`[:30]`) returns a list and loses the QuerySet capabilities, you need to handle the ordering post-fetch in Python.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Fetch the top 30 authors by score\ntop_authors_by_score = Author.objects.order_by('-score')[:30]\n\n# Step 2: Order these authors by last_name\n# Note: Since top_authors_by_score is a list, use Python's sorted() function\nsorted_authors_by_last_name = sorted(top_authors_by_score, key=lambda author: author.last_name)\n\n# Now, sorted_authors_by_last_name contains the top 30 authors ordered by last_name\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Step 1:** `Author.objects.order_by('-score')[:30]` retrieves the top 30 authors based on score. This returns a list, not a QuerySet, because of slicing.\n\n- **Step 2:** Use Python's built-in `sorted()` function to sort this list by the `last_name` attribute. The `key` argument in `sorted()` accepts a function that extracts the comparison key from each element, which is `author.last_name` in this case.\n\nThis method is efficient for a relatively small number of objects (like 30), but if you need to handle this operation on a larger scale, consider database-level solutions such as using subqueries or raw SQL for more performance-intensive needs."
