I am using the Lebedev quadrature points and when I overlay the scatter plot on the spherical surface, most of the points seem to be 'absorbed' by the sphere, making them difficult to see. \n\nHere is the code I used to generate the plot:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import cm, colors\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create a sphere\nr = 1\npi = np.pi\ncos = np.cos\nsin = np.sin\nphi, theta = np.mgrid[0.0:pi:100j, 0.0:2.0*pi:100j]\nx = r*sin(phi)*cos(theta)\ny = r*sin(phi)*sin(theta)\nz = r*cos(phi)\n\n#Import data\ndata = np.genfromtxt('leb.txt')\nxx, yy, zz = np.hsplit(data, 3) \n\n#Set colours and render\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')\n\nax.plot_surface(\n    x, y, z,  rstride=1, cstride=1, color='c', alpha=0.6, linewidth=0)\n\nax.scatter(xx,yy,zz,color=\"k\",s=20)\n\nax.set_xlim([-1,1])\nax.set_ylim([-1,1])\nax.set_zlim([-1,1])\nax.set_aspect(\"equal\")\nplt.tight_layout()\n#plt.show()\n```"

        "content": "To ensure your points are visible on the surface of the sphere in your 3D plot, you can adjust a few aspects of your matplotlib plot:\n\n1. **Increase Alpha Transparency of the Sphere**: By reducing the alpha value of the sphere, you can make it more transparent. This will make the points more visible.\n\n2. **Reduce the Number of Sphere Surface Lines**: By reducing the density of lines on the sphere, you can make the points stand out more.\n\n3. **Increase Size and Change Color of Points**: You can increase the size of the scatter plot points and change their color to something that contrasts well with the sphere.\n\nHere's your modified code with these adjustments:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create a sphere\nr = 1\npi = np.pi\ncos = np.cos\nsin = np.sin\nphi, theta = np.mgrid[0.0:pi:100j, 0.0:2.0*pi:100j]\nx = r*sin(phi)*cos(theta)\ny = r*sin(phi)*sin(theta)\nz = r*cos(phi)\n\n# Import data\ndata = np.genfromtxt('leb.txt')\nxx, yy, zz = np.hsplit(data, 3)\n\n# Set colors and render\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')\n\n# Plot the sphere with increased transparency\nax.plot_surface(\n    x, y, z, rstride=5, cstride=5, color='c', alpha=0.3, linewidth=0)\n\n# Plot the points with larger size and contrasting color\nax.scatter(xx, yy, zz, color=\"r\", s=50)\n\nax.set_xlim([-1, 1])\nax.set_ylim([-1, 1])\nax.set_zlim([-1, 1])\nax.set_aspect(\"equal\")\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- **`alpha=0.3`**: Made the sphere more transparent.\n- **`rstride=5, cstride=5`**: Reduced the number of grid lines on the sphere for better visibility of points.\n- **`color='r', s=50`**: Changed the color of the points to red and increased the size to 50 for better visibility. You can adjust these values according to your preference.\n\nThese modifications should make your scatter points more visible on the sphere. Adjust the color and size of the scatter points further as needed based on your specific visualization requirements."
