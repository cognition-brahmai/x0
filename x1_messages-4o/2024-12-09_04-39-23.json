In PHP, I would accomplish this with the following code: `$output = implode(\",\", $array)`. However, I am unsure how to do this in Python. I have attempted using join, but it doesn't seem to work because the elements in my list are not strings. Should I create a copy of the list and convert each element into a string? Is there a simpler way to accomplish this?"

        "content": "In Python, you can achieve the same result by using the `join` method in combination with a generator expression or a list comprehension to convert each element to a string. You do not need to create a separate copy of the list; you can convert the elements to strings on the fly. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Your list of long integers\nlongs_list = [1234567890123456789, 9876543210987654321, 11223344556677889900]\n\n# Convert each long to a string and join them with a comma\noutput = \",\".join(str(num) for num in longs_list)\n\nprint(output)\n```\n\nIn this example, `str(num) for num in longs_list` is a generator expression that converts each number in the list to a string. The `join` method then joins these string representations with commas.\n\nAlternatively, you can achieve the same result using a list comprehension:\n\n```python\noutput = \",\".join([str(num) for num in longs_list])\n```\n\nBoth approaches are efficient and commonly used in Python for such tasks."
