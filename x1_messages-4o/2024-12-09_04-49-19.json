While I can perform this task on a CPU, I would like to develop a tool that primarily uses GPU (CUDA/CAL) and only reverts to using CPU if there is no GPU available. I've tried conducting my own research, but I've mostly found results related to MD5 crackers. Are there any existing tools or libraries that could assist me with this task or will I need to develop one from scratch? I've also come across http://www.golubev.com/hashgpu.htm and http://boinc.berkeley.edu/, but I am specifically looking for a library."

        "content": "For your project, you can look into existing libraries that support GPU acceleration for hashing algorithms like MD5 and SHA1. While there are several libraries and tools out there primarily focused on password cracking, some can be adapted for general hashing tasks. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN**: While not specifically for hashing, CUDA Toolkit provides the tools and libraries necessary to develop GPU-accelerated applications. You can implement your own hashing algorithms using CUDA if you don't find a suitable library.\n\n2. **OpenCL Libraries**: Libraries like PyOpenCL or CLBlast can be used for parallel computing tasks on GPUs and might be adapted for hashing algorithms.\n\n3. **Hashcat**: Known for password recovery, Hashcat provides implementations of hash algorithms using GPUs. You could look into its source code for insights or adapt it for your purpose if licensing allows.\n\n4. **Crypto++**: Although primarily a CPU-focused library, Crypto++ could be used in combination with OpenCL or CUDA to handle GPU acceleration. You may need to implement the GPU-specific parts yourself.\n\n5. **GPUs Foundational Libraries**: Libraries like NVIDIA cuBLAS or cuRAND can facilitate general computation on the GPU, and you can build hashing on top of these.\n\n6. **Custom Implementation**: If existing libraries don't meet your needs, you might need to implement the hashing algorithm using CUDA. This would involve writing kernels for the hash computation and handling data transfer between host and device memory.\n\nIf you decide to develop your own solution, starting with CUDA or OpenCL tutorials on parallel programming could be beneficial. Additionally, leveraging community forums or GitHub repositories for similar projects might provide useful insights or starting points."
