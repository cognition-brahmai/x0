However, I am encountering an error that says `Could not read roles from Okta`. The system also informs me that `Your Pipfile requires python_version 3.7, but you are using 3.8.3 (/usr/local/Cellar/o/1.1.4/l/.venv/bin/python)`. I've checked all the Pipfiles on my mac and found that the Pipfile under `~/Pipfile` and `/usr/local/Cellar/python@3.8/3.8.3_2/libexec/bin/Pipfile` both have a Python version of 3.8. However, the Pipfile under `/usr/local/Cellar/okta-aws-tools/1.1.4/libexec/Pipfile` requires Python version 3.7. I've been having trouble with this for some time and I'm not sure how to resolve it. How can I downgrade my Python version from 3.8 to 3.7 on a mac?"

        "content": "To downgrade your Python version from 3.8 to 3.7 on a Mac, you can follow these steps. It's important to ensure you're using the correct version for your specific environment, especially when dealing with dependencies like `okta-aws-tools`. Below are the steps you can follow:\n\n1. **Uninstall Python 3.8**: If you no longer need Python 3.8, you can remove it. However, if other projects rely on it, consider managing multiple versions using a version manager like `pyenv`.\n\n   ```bash\n   brew uninstall python@3.8\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Python 3.7**: You can use Homebrew to install Python 3.7.\n\n   ```bash\n   brew install python@3.7\n   ```\n\n3. **Set Python 3.7 as the Default Version**: If you want to use Python 3.7 by default, you can update your shell configuration file (like `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, etc.) to include the path to Python 3.7.\n\n   Open your shell configuration file with a text editor:\n\n   ```bash\n   nano ~/.bash_profile\n   ```\n\n   Add the following line to set Python 3.7 as the default version:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/python@3.7/bin:$PATH\"\n   ```\n\n   Save the file and exit the editor. Then, reload the shell configuration:\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bash_profile\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify the Python Version**: Check if the correct version of Python is being used.\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 --version\n   ```\n\n5. **Use `pyenv` for Version Management (Optional)**: If you often switch between different Python versions, consider using `pyenv`. This tool allows you to easily install and switch between multiple versions of Python.\n\n   Install `pyenv` with Homebrew:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew install pyenv\n   ```\n\n   Install Python 3.7 using `pyenv`:\n\n   ```bash\n   pyenv install 3.7.12\n   ```\n\n   Set Python 3.7 as the global default:\n\n   ```bash\n   pyenv global 3.7.12\n   ```\n\n6. **Recreate Your Virtual Environment**: If you're using a virtual environment, make sure to recreate it with the correct Python version.\n\n   Navigate to your project directory and remove the existing virtual environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   rm -rf .venv\n   ```\n\n   Create a new virtual environment with Python 3.7:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m venv .venv\n   ```\n\n7. **Reinstall Dependencies**: Activate the virtual environment and reinstall your dependencies.\n\n   ```bash\n   source .venv/bin/activate\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n8. **Run `okta-aws init` Again**: Try running the command again to see if the issue is resolved.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to switch to Python 3.7 and resolve the compatibility issues with `okta-aws-tools`."
