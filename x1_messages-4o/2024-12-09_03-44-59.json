Instead, you should specify just the version number without the `>=` operator or the word \"python.\" Here's the correct way to specify a minimum Python version in a `Pipfile`:\n\n```ini\n[requires]\npython_version = \"3.5\"\n```\n\nThis indicates to Pipenv that your project requires at least Python 3.5. While this doesn't explicitly enforce the minimum version constraint (`>=`), Pipenv will use this version when creating a virtual environment if no other version is specified.\n\nIf you want to be explicit about the minimum version and ensure that your project uses a Python version that meets or exceeds it, it's a good practice to manage your Python installations using a tool like `pyenv`. This way, you can ensure that the correct version of Python is used when creating the virtual environment with Pipenv."
