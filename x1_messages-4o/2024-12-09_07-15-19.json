        "content": "Is there an efficient way to implement a similar functionality to a Python \"for-else\" loop in Java? \n\nIn Python, there is a \"for-else\" loop where the else block executes when the loop has completed normally (i.e. when the loop didn't hit a break statement). An example Python code is provided below:\n\n```python\nfor x in range(2, n):\n    if n % x == 0:\n        print n, 'equals', x, '*', n/x\n        break\nelse:\n    # loop fell through without finding a factor\n    print n, 'is a prime number'\n```\n\nIn Java, I'm currently using a boolean flag to track if the loop completed normally:\n\n```java\nboolean finishedForLoop = true;\nfor (int x : rangeListOfIntegers){\n    if (n % x == 0) {\n        // Some printing here\n        finishedForLoop = false;\n        break;\n    }\n}\nif (finishedForLoop == true) {\n    // Some printing here\n}\n```\n\nIs there a more efficient or more concise way to achieve this in Java?"

        "content": "In Java, you don't have a built-in \"for-else\" construct like Python, but you can achieve similar functionality using a `boolean` flag or through structured control flow, as you've already done. However, there is a slightly more concise and idiomatic way to implement this using a method to encapsulate the loop logic. This can help make your code cleaner and more readable. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Using a Method\n\nYou can extract the loop logic into a separate method that returns a boolean indicating whether the loop completed normally:\n\n```java\npublic class PrimeChecker {\n    \n    public static boolean isPrime(int n) {\n        for (int x = 2; x < n; x++) {\n            if (n % x == 0) {\n                // Found a factor, not a prime\n                System.out.println(n + \" equals \" + x + \" * \" + (n / x));\n                return false;\n            }\n        }\n        // No factors found, it's a prime\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int n = 29; // Example number\n        if (isPrime(n)) {\n            System.out.println(n + \" is a prime number\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Method Extraction**: The loop logic is encapsulated within the `isPrime` method. This method returns `false` as soon as it finds a factor, mimicking the `break` behavior and preventing the `else` block equivalent from executing immediately.\n- **Return Value**: If the method completes without finding a factor, it returns `true`, which can be checked in the `main` method to execute the \"else\" logic only if the loop completes normally.\n- **Readability**: This approach improves readability and separates concerns, making it clear that the method checks for primality and handles the output accordingly.\n\nThis strategy allows you to achieve a similar logical flow to Python's \"for-else\" construct in a more idiomatic Java way."
