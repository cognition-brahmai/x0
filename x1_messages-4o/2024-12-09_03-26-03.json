When trying to use the apply method, as shown below, I noticed that it doesn't accept any arguments. \n\n```python\nx = my_series.apply(my_function, more_arguments_1)\ny = my_series.apply(my_function, more_arguments_2)\n...\n```\n\nIs there a different method that accepts arguments, or am I missing a simple workaround? I did notice an update in October 2017 that the pandas apply() method was updated to handle positional and keyword arguments. How can I include either type of argument?"

        "content": "To apply a function with additional arguments to each element in a `pandas.Series`, you can indeed use the `apply` method along with the `args` and `**kwargs` parameters for positional and keyword arguments, respectively.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Example function that takes multiple arguments\ndef my_function(x, arg1, arg2):\n    return x + arg1 + arg2\n\n# Sample Series\nmy_series = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n\n# Applying the function with additional arguments\n# Using positional arguments with `args`\nresult_with_args = my_series.apply(my_function, args=(10, 20))\n\n# Using keyword arguments with `**kwargs`\nresult_with_kwargs = my_series.apply(my_function, arg1=10, arg2=20)\n\nprint(result_with_args)\nprint(result_with_kwargs)\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- `args` is a tuple of positional arguments that you want to pass to the function.\n- `**kwargs` allows you to pass keyword arguments to the function.\n\nBoth approaches will provide the same result, allowing you to apply `my_function` with additional arguments to each element in `my_series`. This feature lets you pass any number of additional arguments to the function you're applying across the Series."
