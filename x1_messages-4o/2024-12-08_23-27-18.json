The sum of students in departments A and B is a multiple of 10, while the sum of students in departments B and C is a prime number. To find the minimum number of students in each department, please provide a shell command that utilizes multi-step reasoning based on these conditions, replacing general concepts with more specific ones."

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of students in departments A, B, and C that satisfy the given conditions. Let's break down the conditions:\n\n1. Department A has a prime number of students.\n2. Department B has a perfect square number of students.\n3. Department C has a multiple of 5 students.\n4. The sum of students in departments A and B is a multiple of 10.\n5. The sum of students in departments B and C is a prime number.\n\nWe can approach this problem by iterating over possible values for each department and checking the conditions. Here's a shell command using a `bash` script and `awk` for calculations:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Function to check if a number is prime\nis_prime() {\n  local num=$1\n  if (( num <= 1 )); then\n    return 1\n  fi\n  for (( i=2; i*i<=num; i++ )); do\n    if (( num % i == 0 )); then\n      return 1\n    fi\n  done\n  return 0\n}\n\n# Iterate over possible values for department A\nfor A in {2..100}\ndo\n  # Check if A is a prime number\n  is_prime $A\n  if (( $? == 1 )); then\n    continue\n  fi\n\n  # Iterate over possible values for department B\n  for B in {1..10}\n  do\n    B_square=$((B * B))\n\n    # Check if A + B_square is a multiple of 10\n    if (( (A + B_square) % 10 != 0 )); then\n      continue\n    fi\n\n    # Iterate over possible values for department C\n    for C in {0..100}\n    do\n      # Check if C is a multiple of 5\n      if (( C % 5 != 0 )); then\n        continue\n      fi\n\n      # Check if B_square + C is a prime number\n      is_prime $((B_square + C))\n      if (( $? == 0 )); then\n        echo \"Department A: $A, Department B: $B_square, Department C: $C\"\n        exit\n      fi\n    done\n  done\ndone\n```\n\nThis script iteratively checks each combination of students in departments A, B, and C, ensuring each condition is satisfied, and prints the first valid combination it finds. Make sure to save this script to a file and run it in a shell environment that supports bash."
