Here's one way to do it:\n\n```bash\necho '{\"numbers\": ['$(seq -s, 6 5 $((6 + (10 - 1) * 5)))']}' | jq .\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `seq -s, 6 5 $((6 + (10 - 1) * 5))`: This command generates a sequence starting at 6, incrementing by 5, and stopping after generating 10 numbers.\n- `echo '{\"numbers\": ['$(...)']}'`: This wraps the sequence in a JSON structure.\n- `jq .`: This formats the output as pretty JSON for readability.\n\nThis will result in the following JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"numbers\": [6, 11, 16, 21, 26, 31, 36, 41, 46, 51]\n}\n```\n\nYou can run this command in a Unix-like shell environment."
