        "content": "Certainly! To calculate the number of possible paths from one point to another in a grid, you can use a combinatorial approach if movements are restricted to only right and down directions (like in a classic grid problem). Here's a Python script that calculates the number of paths using the concept of binomial coefficients:\n\n```python\nfrom math import comb\n\ndef number_of_paths(m, n):\n    # Calculate the number of paths using the binomial coefficient\n    # (m+n-2) choose (m-1) or (m+n-2) choose (n-1)\n    return comb(m + n - 2, m - 1)\n\ndef main():\n    # Define grid size (m x n)\n    m = 3  # number of rows\n    n = 3  # number of columns\n    \n    # Calculate number of paths\n    paths = number_of_paths(m, n)\n    \n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The number of possible paths in a {m}x{n} grid is: {paths}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Binomial Coefficient**: The problem can be seen as choosing `m-1` movements down (or `n-1` movements right) from a total of `m+n-2` movements. This is a classic combinatorial problem where you calculate the binomial coefficient \\( C(m+n-2, m-1) \\).\n\n2. **Python `math.comb`**: The `math.comb` function is used to compute the binomial coefficient directly, which represents the number of ways to choose `k` items from `n` items without regard to the order of selection.\n\n3. **Function `number_of_paths(m, n)`**: This function calculates the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of an `m x n` grid.\n\nFeel free to modify the `m` and `n` values in the `main` function to test with different grid sizes. This script assumes that you can only move right or down at any point in time, which is a common constraint in grid path problems."
