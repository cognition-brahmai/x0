I am specifically looking for which CSS file to modify and what should be put in it to change the font. I am on a Windows system. I have tried solutions from previous Stack Overflow questions, including modifying an unnamed file in /usr/lib/python2.6/.../css/, changing the monospace font in the browser, and altering custom.css in the profile subdirectory /static/custom/custom.css. However, the font changed to italic after I change the monospace font in my browser, which is not what I intended."

        "content": "To change the default font in an IPython (Jupyter) Notebook, you can modify the `custom.css` file. This file allows you to override the default styles used by Jupyter Notebook. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to change the font:\n\n1. **Locate the `custom.css` File:**\n   - The `custom.css` file is typically located in your Jupyter profile directory under `~/.jupyter/custom/` on Unix-like systems. On Windows, you can usually find it in `C:\\Users\\<YourUsername>\\.jupyter\\custom\\`.\n\n2. **Create or Edit `custom.css`:**\n   - If the `custom` directory or `custom.css` file does not exist, you need to create them. Navigate to the `.jupyter` directory and create a folder named `custom` if it isn't there. Inside the `custom` folder, create a new file named `custom.css`.\n\n3. **Modify `custom.css`:**\n   - Open `custom.css` in a text editor and add the following CSS to change the font. You can specify the font family you prefer:\n\n   ```css\n   /* Change the font of code cells */\n   .CodeMirror pre {\n       font-family: \"YourPreferredFont\", monospace;\n       font-size: 12pt; /* You can adjust the size as needed */\n   }\n\n   /* Change the font of markdown cells */\n   .rendered_html {\n       font-family: \"YourPreferredFont\", sans-serif;\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Replace `\"YourPreferredFont\"` with the name of the font you want to use. Make sure the font is installed on your system.\n\n4. **Restart Jupyter Notebook:**\n   - After saving your changes, restart your Jupyter Notebook server for the changes to take effect. You can do this by closing the terminal or command prompt running the notebook server and starting it again.\n\n5. **Check Browser Settings:**\n   - Since you mentioned the font changed to italic, ensure your browser settings are not overriding the font style. Reset any custom settings related to font styling in your browser.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to change the font in your Jupyter Notebook without it turning italic unless specified. If you continue to experience issues, double-check the CSS syntax and ensure there are no other conflicting styles in your environment."
