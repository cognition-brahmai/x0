I currently have a list as follows:\n\n```python\nnumbers = ['1', '5', '10', '8'];\n```\n\nI want to transform it into:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 5, 10, 8];\n```\n\nI am currently using a loop to achieve this:\n\n```python\nnew_numbers = [];\nfor n in numbers:\n    new_numbers.append(int(n));\nnumbers = new_numbers;\n```\n\nI believe there is a more pythonic way to do this in a single line of code. Do you have any suggestions?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this transformation in a more concise and pythonic way using a list comprehension. List comprehensions are a powerful feature in Python that allow you to create new lists by applying an expression to each item in a sequence. Here's how you can transform your list of numeric strings into a list of integers in a single line:\n\n```python\nnumbers = ['1', '5', '10', '8']\nnumbers = [int(n) for n in numbers]\n```\n\nThis line of code creates a new list by iterating over each element `n` in the original `numbers` list, converting each `n` to an integer using `int(n)`, and collecting the results into a new list. The resulting `numbers` list will contain the integers `[1, 5, 10, 8]`."
