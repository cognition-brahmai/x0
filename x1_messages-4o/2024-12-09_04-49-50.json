But is there a way to get two output lists instead, one containing elements that match the criterion and another with the remaining elements? I would like to achieve this without calling the `filter()` function twice. The order of elements should be preserved and identical elements could appear multiple times."

        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this by using a list comprehension or by iterating through the list once and using a tuple of lists to separate the elements based on the condition. Here's one way to do it:\n\n```python\ndef separate_lists(criteria, lst):\n    match, no_match = [], []\n    for item in lst:\n        if criteria(item):\n            match.append(item)\n        else:\n            no_match.append(item)\n    return match, no_match\n\n# Example usage:\nlst = [1, 4, 12, 7, 42]\ncriteria = lambda x: x > 10\nmatched, not_matched = separate_lists(criteria, lst)\n\nprint(\"Matched:\", matched)\nprint(\"Not Matched:\", not_matched)\n```\n\nIn this code, we define a function `separate_lists` that takes a criterion and a list as input. It iterates over the list once and appends each element to either the `match` or `no_match` list based on whether it satisfies the criterion. This way, you get two separate lists with only one pass through the original list."
