Even though I am certain that I have modules like pandas installed, Jupyter Notebook fails to find them and says that they are not found. Interestingly, when I run the script normally using the command `python script.py`, the modules are imported without any errors. Could you suggest a possible solution?"

        "content": "Certainly! This issue often arises due to Jupyter Notebook using a different Python environment than the one where your modules are installed. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this:\n\n1. **Check Python Environment in Jupyter:**\n   - Run the following command in a Jupyter Notebook cell to check which Python executable is being used:\n     ```python\n     import sys\n     print(sys.executable)\n     ```\n   - Compare this path with the one you get from running `which python` (on Unix/Linux) or `where python` (on Windows) in your terminal where the modules work. If they are different, Jupyter is using a different environment.\n\n2. **Install Modules in the Jupyter Environment:**\n   - If Jupyter is using a different environment, you can install the missing packages in that environment by running:\n     ```python\n     !pip install pandas\n     ```\n   - Alternatively, you can install the module from the terminal using the path to the Python executable that Jupyter is using:\n     ```bash\n     /path/to/jupyter/python -m pip install pandas\n     ```\n\n3. **Use Virtual Environments:**\n   - If you are using virtual environments (like `venv` or `conda`), make sure that Jupyter is installed in the same environment.\n   - You can install a specific kernel for Jupyter from your active environment using:\n     ```bash\n     python -m ipykernel install --user --name myenv --display-name \"Python (myenv)\"\n     ```\n   - Then, switch to this kernel in Jupyter Notebook by going to `Kernel` > `Change Kernel` > `Python (myenv)`.\n\n4. **Reinstall Jupyter Notebook:**\n   - If Jupyter Notebook is not installed in the environment where your modules are, consider reinstalling it:\n     ```bash\n     pip install jupyter\n     ```\n\n5. **Check PATH and Environment Variables:**\n   - Ensure that your environment variables and PATH are set correctly to point to the environment you intend to use.\n\nFollowing these steps should help you align the Python environment used by Jupyter Notebook with the one where your packages are installed. If you are using `conda`, make sure to activate your environment before launching Jupyter Notebook."
