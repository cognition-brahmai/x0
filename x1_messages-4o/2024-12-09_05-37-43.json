Given two lists `a = [1,2,3,4,5]` and `b = [1,3,5,6]`, I tried to use a boolean AND operation to find the intersection, like so:\n```python\nc = a and b\nprint(c)\n```\nBut the actual output is `[1,3,5,6]`, while I expected the output to be `[1,3,5]`. How can I correctly perform a list intersection operation on these two lists?"

        "content": "In Python, using the `and` operator between two lists does not perform an intersection; instead, it evaluates to the second list if both are non-empty. To find the intersection of two lists, you can use a set-based approach, which is efficient and straightforward. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\na = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nb = [1, 3, 5, 6]\n\n# Convert both lists to sets and use the intersection operator\nintersection = list(set(a) & set(b))\n\nprint(intersection)\n```\n\nThis code will output `[1, 3, 5]`, which is the intersection of the two lists. The `set` data structure automatically handles duplicates and allows you to use the `&` operator to find common elements between sets. Finally, converting the result back to a list gives you the desired output."
