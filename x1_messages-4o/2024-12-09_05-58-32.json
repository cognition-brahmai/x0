Currently, I am using the following approach:\n\n```python\nfirst = True\nfor member in something.get():\n    if first:\n        root.copy(member)\n        first = False\n    else:\n        somewhereElse.copy(member)\n    foo(member)\n```"

        "content": "Yes, there is a more elegant and Pythonic way to handle this scenario by using the `enumerate` function. This allows you to keep track of the index of each iteration, making it easy to perform an action only on the first iteration. Here's how you can rewrite your code:\n\n```python\nfor index, member in enumerate(something.get()):\n    if index == 0:\n        root.copy(member)\n    else:\n        somewhereElse.copy(member)\n    foo(member)\n```\n\nIn this version, `enumerate` is used to get both the index and the member in each iteration. When `index` is `0`, it means it's the first iteration, and you can execute the specific function for that case. This approach makes the code more concise and removes the need for a separate `first` variable."
