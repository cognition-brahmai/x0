Additionally, how can I generate a similar timestamp using the `strftime` function in Python? My current attempt is as follows: \n```python\nx.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%Z\")\n```\nwhich results in '2015-03-26T10:58:51'. Unfortunately, this doesn't include the 'Z' at the end."

        "content": "In the timestamp format \"2014-09-12T19:34:29Z\", the 'T' and 'Z' have specific meanings:\n\n1. **'T'**: This character is used as a separator between the date and the time components of the timestamp. It indicates the start of the time element of the timestamp.\n\n2. **'Z'**: This letter stands for \"Zulu\" time, which is another term for Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). It indicates that the time is in the UTC timezone. The presence of 'Z' at the end of the timestamp means that the time is not offset by any timezone difference.\n\nTo generate a similar timestamp in Python using the `strftime` method, you need to make sure that you are formatting the time in UTC and explicitly adding the 'Z' to indicate that the time is in UTC. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timezone\n\n# Get the current time in UTC\nnow_utc = datetime.now(timezone.utc)\n\n# Format the time with strftime and append 'Z' to indicate UTC\ntimestamp = now_utc.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S\") + 'Z'\n\nprint(timestamp)\n```\n\nThis will produce a timestamp string that includes the 'Z' at the end, correctly indicating UTC time. Make sure that your datetime object is timezone-aware and set to UTC to ensure the correct representation."
