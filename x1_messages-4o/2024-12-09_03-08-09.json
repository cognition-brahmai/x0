        "content": "I am having trouble understanding method chaining in Python. I have found some resources, including a stack overflow post on method chaining in python, but I'm still not completely confident with callables. My goal is to create a class that has two methods: one sets an object parameter to 'line' and the other overwrites it to 'bar'. I have some code, but it does not give me the desired result. I want to be able to achieve my goal by writing the code as \"a.bar.line.bar.bar.line.my_print()\". I suspect there might be something wrong with how I have defined the \"__call__\" method. Could someone help me correct this?\n\nThis is the code I have so far:\n\n```python\nclass foo():\n    def __init__(self, kind=None):\n        self.kind = kind\n\n    def __call__(self, kind=None):\n        return foo(kind=kind)\n\n    def my_print(self):\n        print (self.kind)\n\n    def line(self):\n        return self(kind='line')\n    def bar(self):\n        return self(kind='bar')\n```\n\nAnd I am currently able to achieve my goal by writing the code as \"a.bar().line().bar().bar().line().my_print()\"."

        "content": "To achieve method chaining without needing to use parentheses after each method, you can modify your class to return `self` directly from the `line` and `bar` methods instead of creating a new instance. You don't need to use the `__call__` method for this particular use case. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nclass foo():\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.kind = None\n\n    def my_print(self):\n        print(self.kind)\n\n    def line(self):\n        self.kind = 'line'\n        return self\n\n    def bar(self):\n        self.kind = 'bar'\n        return self\n\n# Usage\na = foo()\na.bar().line().bar().bar().line().my_print()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Return `self`**: By returning `self`, you allow the next method to be called directly on the same instance, enabling method chaining without parentheses.\n- **Remove `__call__`**: The `__call__` method is not necessary for this chaining pattern since you're modifying the same instance rather than creating a new one.\n- **Modify Kind Directly**: Instead of creating a new instance with a different `kind`, simply modify the `kind` attribute of the current instance.\n\nNow, when you call `a.bar.line.bar.bar.line.my_print()`, it will work as expected, setting `kind` to 'line' and printing it."
