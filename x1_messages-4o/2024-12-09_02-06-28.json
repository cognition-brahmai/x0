        "content": "The error you're encountering indicates that the `%tensorboard` magic command isn't recognized in your Jupyter environment. This could be due to a few reasons, such as the TensorBoard Jupyter extension not being properly installed or enabled. Here's how you can address this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure TensorBoard is Installed:**\n   Make sure TensorBoard is installed in your current Python environment. You can verify and install it using:\n   ```bash\n   pip install tensorboard\n   ```\n\n2. **Install TensorFlow and TensorBoard Jupyter Extension:**\n   You need to have `tensorflow` installed, which you already have. However, ensure that the TensorBoard extension for Jupyter is also installed:\n   ```bash\n   pip install tensorflow\n   pip install tensorboard\n   ```\n\n3. **Load the TensorBoard Extension in Jupyter:**\n   Once installed, you need to enable the TensorBoard extension in Jupyter Notebook. Run the following command in a Jupyter Notebook cell:\n   ```python\n   %load_ext tensorboard\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Updates:**\n   Ensure that your Jupyter and notebook are up to date. You can update them using:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade jupyter\n   pip install --upgrade notebook\n   ```\n\n5. **Use the Correct Command:**\n   Once the extension is loaded, try using the `%tensorboard` magic command again. Make sure your log directory path is correct:\n   ```python\n   %load_ext tensorboard\n   %tensorboard --logdir {logs_base_dir}\n   ```\n\n6. **Alternative Method:**\n   If the magic command still doesn't work, you can launch TensorBoard from the command line or terminal. Navigate to your project directory and run:\n   ```bash\n   tensorboard --logdir=logs_base_dir\n   ```\n\n7. **Check Environment:**\n   Ensure that your Jupyter Notebook is running in the same virtual environment where TensorFlow and TensorBoard are installed.\n\nIf you follow these steps and still face issues, it might be useful to check the version compatibility between TensorFlow, TensorBoard, and your Jupyter Notebook environment."
