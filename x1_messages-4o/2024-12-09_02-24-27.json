I'm trying to use a regular expression with a raw string to define the pattern, which has repeating elements and variables. I also want to use the `format()` method for string formatting. Here's my current code:\n\n```python\nimport re\ntext = '\"\"\"!some text'\nre.findall(r'\"{3}{symbol}some\\stext'.format(symbol='!'), text)\n```\n\nHowever, I'm encountering an `IndexError: tuple index out of range`. How can I format a raw string if it has formatting curly-braces expression, and repeating curly-braces expression inside?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the way Python's `str.format()` method interacts with curly braces `{}` in raw strings, especially when they are used both for string formatting and as part of a regular expression pattern.\n\nTo resolve this, you can use double curly braces `{{` and `}}` to escape the curly braces that are part of the regex pattern, while leaving the single curly braces for the `format()` method to replace. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ntext = '\"\"\"!some text'\npattern = r'\"{{3}}{symbol}some\\stext'.format(symbol='!')\nmatches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n\nprint(matches)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Double Curly Braces `{{}}`:** In the format string, `{{` and `}}` are used to include literal curly braces in the output. This is needed to ensure that the `{3}` part of the regex is treated as a quantifier for three double quotes `\"\"\"`, and not as a placeholder for `format()`.\n- **`format(symbol='!')`:** This will replace `{symbol}` with `!`, resulting in the correct regex pattern.\n\nBy using double curly braces, you can seamlessly integrate string formatting with raw strings and regular expressions."
