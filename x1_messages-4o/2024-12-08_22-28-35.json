Below are the C# code examples for computing the volume of a sphere and the surface area of a cube.\n\n### Volume of a Sphere\n\nThe formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere with radius \\( r \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 \\]\n\nHere is the C# code using `Math.PI` and `Math.Pow`:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        double radius = 5.0;  // Example radius\n        double volume = (4.0 / 3.0) * Math.PI * Math.Pow(radius, 3);\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Volume of the sphere: \" + volume);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Surface Area of a Cube\n\nThe formula for the surface area \\( A \\) of a cube with side length \\( s \\) is:\n\n\\[ A = 6s^2 \\]\n\nHere is the C# code using `Math.Pow`:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        double sideLength = 3.0;  // Example side length\n        double surfaceArea = 6 * Math.Pow(sideLength, 2);\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Surface area of the cube: \" + surfaceArea);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn both examples, you can change the `radius` and `sideLength` variables to compute the volume of a sphere or surface area of a cube with different dimensions."
