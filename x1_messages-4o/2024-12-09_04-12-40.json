        "content": "The issues you're encountering are due to changes in the Python standard library between versions. In Python 3, `urllib` and `urllib2` were merged into the `urllib` package, and some functions were moved around. Since you're using Python 3.1, the updated way to fetch the contents of a webpage is slightly different from Python 2.x.\n\nHere's how you can do it in Python 3.1 using the `urllib` package:\n\n```python\nimport urllib.request\n\nurl = \"http://services.runescape.com/m=hiscore/ranking?table=0&category_type=0&time_filter=0&date=1519066080774&user=zezima\"\n\ntry:\n    with urllib.request.urlopen(url) as response:\n        webpage_content = response.read()\n        print(webpage_content)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`urllib.request.urlopen(url)`**: This is the correct way to open a URL in Python 3.x.\n- **`with` statement**: It's used here to ensure that the connection to the URL is properly closed after the block is executed.\n- **`response.read()`**: This reads the content of the webpage.\n\nMake sure your Python environment has internet access and that the URL is accessible. If you run into further issues, such as network errors, you might want to check your internet connection or the URL's availability."
