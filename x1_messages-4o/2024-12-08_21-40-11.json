        "content": "To achieve this task, you need to parse a JSON dataset containing information about historical figures associated with the Civil Rights Movement. First, I'll provide you with a Python code snippet that retrieves the names of the top 10 most influential figures. Then, I'll show you how to modify the code to also display their birth dates in ascending order.\n\nLet's assume your JSON dataset looks something like this:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"name\": \"Martin Luther King Jr.\", \"birth_date\": \"1929-01-15\", \"birth_place\": \"Atlanta, Georgia\", \"achievements\": \"...\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Rosa Parks\", \"birth_date\": \"1913-02-04\", \"birth_place\": \"Tuskegee, Alabama\", \"achievements\": \"...\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Malcolm X\", \"birth_date\": \"1925-05-19\", \"birth_place\": \"Omaha, Nebraska\", \"achievements\": \"...\"},\n    ...\n]\n```\n\nHere's a Python code snippet to retrieve and print the names of the top 10 most influential figures:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Your JSON dataset as a string\njson_data = '''\n[\n    {\"name\": \"Martin Luther King Jr.\", \"birth_date\": \"1929-01-15\", \"birth_place\": \"Atlanta, Georgia\", \"achievements\": \"...\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Rosa Parks\", \"birth_date\": \"1913-02-04\", \"birth_place\": \"Tuskegee, Alabama\", \"achievements\": \"...\"},\n    {\"name\": \"Malcolm X\", \"birth_date\": \"1925-05-19\", \"birth_place\": \"Omaha, Nebraska\", \"achievements\": \"...\"}\n    // more entries\n]\n'''\n\n# Load the JSON data\ndata = json.loads(json_data)\n\n# Assuming the dataset is pre-filtered or sorted by influence, otherwise you'll need a criteria to sort them.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the first 10 are the most influential.\ntop_10_figures = data[:10]\n\n# Print the names\nprint(\"Top 10 Influential Figures in the Civil Rights Movement:\")\nfor figure in top_10_figures:\n    print(figure[\"name\"])\n\n# Sorting by birth date to display in ascending order\ntop_10_figures_sorted_by_birth_date = sorted(top_10_figures, key=lambda x: x[\"birth_date\"])\n\n# Print names and birth dates in ascending order of birth date\nprint(\"\\nTop 10 Influential Figures in the Civil Rights Movement (Sorted by Birth Date):\")\nfor figure in top_10_figures_sorted_by_birth_date:\n    print(f\"{figure['name']} - {figure['birth_date']}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Loading JSON Data**: The `json.loads()` function is used to parse your JSON data string into a Python list of dictionaries.\n2. **Selecting Top 10**: The code assumes the dataset is already sorted based on influence, and slices the first 10 entries.\n3. **Sorting by Birth Date**: The `sorted()` function sorts the list of dictionaries based on the `birth_date` key.\n4. **Printing**: The code prints the names and birth dates of the top 10 most influential figures.\n\nThis code snippet assumes that your dataset is already filtered or sorted by influence. If not, you would need a specific criterion to determine influence and sort the dataset accordingly before selecting the top 10."
