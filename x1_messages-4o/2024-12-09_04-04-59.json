Is there a more optimal pandas method to truncate the 'TimeStamp' column to hour precision?"

        "content": "Yes, there is a more efficient way to truncate the `Timestamp` column to hour precision using pandas built-in functions. Instead of using the `apply` method with a lambda function, you can utilize the `dt.floor` method, which is specifically designed for this kind of operation and should be faster. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndf['dt2'] = df['dt'].dt.floor('H')\n```\n\nThe `dt.floor` method rounds down the `Timestamp` to the nearest specified frequency, which in this case is 'H' for hour. This method is vectorized and will be more efficient than applying a lambda function over the DataFrame."
