I am considering three options:\n\n1. `def foo() -> None:` Although this seems illogical to me because `None` is not a type.\n2. `def foo() -> type(None):` This uses the best syntax I know for obtaining `NoneType`.\n3. `def foo():` Here, I would omit explicit return type information.\n\nOption 2 seems the most logical to me, but I have already seen some instances of option 1. Can anyone advise on the correct way to annotate a \"void\" return type in Python?"

        "content": "In Python, when you're dealing with a function that does not return a value (similar to \"void\" in other programming languages), the conventional way to annotate its return type is to use `None`. This is because `None` is a singleton instance of `NoneType`, which effectively represents the absence of a value.\n\nHere's the reasoning for each option:\n\n1. `def foo() -> None:` is indeed the correct and most commonly used way to annotate a function that doesn't return a value. Although `None` is not a type by itself, in the context of type annotations, it is used to signify that the function does not return any meaningful value.\n\n2. `def foo() -> type(None):` is technically correct but not commonly used. It does represent the type of `None`, which is `NoneType`. However, this style is more verbose and less idiomatic in the Python community.\n\n3. `def foo():` is also valid and perfectly fine if you prefer not to use type annotations. It simply means you are choosing not to specify a return type, but it doesn't explicitly convey the intention that the function is not returning a value.\n\nIn summary, the most conventional and widely accepted way to annotate a function with no return value in Python is to use `def foo() -> None:`. This is clear, concise, and aligns with the common practices in the Python community."
