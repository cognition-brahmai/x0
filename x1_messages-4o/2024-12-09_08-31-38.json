I've tried looking up solutions, but could not find any. Can anyone explain what this error means and what might be causing it?

        "content": "The `InvalidArgumentError: Expected dimension in the range [-1, 1) but got 1` is typically related to a mismatch in the expected dimensions of tensors in TensorFlow. This error often arises when a tensor operation expects inputs of a certain shape or rank but receives something different. Here are a few potential causes and solutions you can explore:\n\n1. **Shape Mismatch in Tensors**: This error might be occurring if you are passing data to a placeholder or operation with a shape that doesn't match the expected shape. Verify that the shapes of `batch_images`, `batch_labels`, and any other tensors being fed into placeholders or operations match the expected shapes.\n\n2. **Output Layer Shape**: If your network's output layer has a shape that doesn't match the labels' shape, an error like this can occur. Make sure that the output layer of your network produces logits or predictions that have the same shape as your labels.\n\n3. **Accuracy Calculation**: The error may be originating from how the accuracy is calculated. Ensure that the predictions and labels are compatible in shape. If you are using `tf.argmax` or a similar operation, verify that the axis argument is correct.\n\n4. **Placeholder Shapes**: Check the shapes defined in your placeholders. Ensure they match the input data dimensions. For example, if `x` is for images, ensure its shape matches `batch_images`. Similarly, verify the shape of `y` matches `batch_labels`.\n\n5. **Feed Dictionary**: When using `feed_dict`, ensure that each key corresponds to the correct placeholder and that the data being fed matches the placeholder's expected shape.\n\nTo diagnose the exact cause, consider adding print statements or assertions to check the shapes of your tensors before they are fed into operations. You can also use TensorFlow's debugging tools or inspect the model using TensorBoard to visualize the tensor shapes in your graph.\n\nIf these suggestions don't resolve the issue, please check the linked code and trace where the shape mismatch occurs, focusing particularly on the parts of your code where you define models, placeholder shapes, and the accuracy calculation."
