Here is the code I'm trying to use:\n```python\nds = [d1, d2]\n{**d for d in ds}\n```\nThe error message received is `SyntaxError: dict unpacking cannot be used in dict comprehension`.\nTo merge the dictionaries, I have to use `reduce(lambda x,y: {**x, **y}, ds, {})`, which looks a lot more complicated. I don't understand why the parser doesn't allow the simpler way to do it. Is there a reason for this, or a way around it?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that the syntax `{**d for d in ds}` isn't valid in Python. The `**` unpacking operator is not allowed within a dictionary comprehension. This is because dictionary comprehensions are designed to construct dictionaries from key-value pairs, not to perform unpacking operations.\n\nThe `{**d1, **d2}` syntax works because it's directly unpacking two dictionaries into a new dictionary literal, but when you attempt to generalize this inside a comprehension, Python does not support this operation because it expects key-value pairs.\n\nTo merge multiple dictionaries dynamically, you can use a more straightforward approach than `reduce`. One common pattern to achieve this is by using a loop to update a single dictionary:\n\n```python\nd1 = {1: 'one', 2: 'two'}\nd2 = {3: 'three'}\nds = [d1, d2]\n\nmerged_dict = {}\nfor d in ds:\n    merged_dict.update(d)\n\nprint(merged_dict)\n```\n\nThis will give you the desired merged dictionary `{1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}`.\n\nAlternatively, from Python 3.9 onwards, you can use the union operator `|` to merge dictionaries:\n\n```python\nd1 = {1: 'one', 2: 'two'}\nd2 = {3: 'three'}\nds = [d1, d2]\n\nmerged_dict = {}\nfor d in ds:\n    merged_dict |= d\n\nprint(merged_dict)\n```\n\nHowever, since you are using Python 3.5, the loop with `update` is the best approach for clarity and simplicity."
