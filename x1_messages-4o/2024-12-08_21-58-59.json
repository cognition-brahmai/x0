You can use a combination of shell commands and tools like `shuf`, `awk`, and `sed` to generate a unique song title that includes at least one word from a given list of sci-fi jargon. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. Create a file named `sci-fi-jargon.txt` containing your list of sci-fi jargon words, each on a new line. For example:\n\n   ```\n   quantum\n   nebula\n   hyperspace\n   singularity\n   asteroid\n   cyborg\n   terraform\n   warp\n   dystopia\n   nanotech\n   ```\n\n2. Use the following shell command to generate a unique song title:\n\n   ```bash\n   #!/bin/bash\n\n   # Read the list of sci-fi jargon into an array\n   mapfile -t jargon < sci-fi-jargon.txt\n\n   # Generate a random word from the jargon list\n   random_jargon_word=$(shuf -n1 sci-fi-jargon.txt)\n\n   # Generate additional random words for the title\n   additional_words=$(shuf -n$((RANDOM % 3 + 2)) /usr/share/dict/words | awk '{print toupper(substr($0,1,1))tolower(substr($0,2))}')\n\n   # Combine the words into a title\n   title=\"${random_jargon_word^} $additional_words\"\n\n   # Capitalize each word in the title\n   song_title=$(echo \"$title\" | sed 's/\\b[a-z]/\\u&/g')\n\n   echo \"Unique Song Title: $song_title\"\n   ```\n\n3. Save this script to a file, for example `generate_song_title.sh`, and make it executable with `chmod +x generate_song_title.sh`.\n\n4. Run the script with `./generate_song_title.sh` to generate a unique song title.\n\nThis shell script reads a random word from your list of sci-fi jargon and combines it with additional random words from the system dictionary to form a unique song title. The script ensures that the first word from your list is always included and capitalizes each word in the title for a polished look."
