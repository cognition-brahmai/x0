The function `f` and list `a` are defined as follows in Python:\n\n```python\ndef f(x,y,z): return [x,y,z]\n\na=[1,2]\n```\n\nI can successfully call the function with `f(3,*a)` and the elements of `a` get unpacked as if I had called it like `f(3,1,2)`. However, when I try to unpack the elements of `a` into the first two arguments with `f(*a,3)`, instead of calling that like `f(1,2,3)`, I get a \"SyntaxError: only named arguments may follow *expression\".\n\nWhy is it necessary to follow this syntax rule? Is there a clever trick for unpacking arrays into arbitrary parts of argument lists without resorting to temporary variables?"

        "content": "In Python, when you use the `*` operator to unpack elements from an iterable like a list or tuple into function arguments, it's necessary to follow specific syntax rules. The rule you're encountering is that any positional arguments specified after the `*` unpacking must be keyword arguments. This ensures clarity in how elements from the iterable are distributed into the function's parameters.\n\nThe syntax `f(*a, 3)` attempts to unpack `a` into the first arguments and then specifies `3` as another positional argument, which leads to the error. This is because Python cannot differentiate between elements unpacked from the list and the subsequent positional argument without explicit naming.\n\nTo unpack elements into arbitrary positions without using temporary variables, you can use keyword arguments for the later positions like this:\n\n```python\nf(*a, z=3)\n```\n\nIn this example, `*a` unpacks into the first two positions (`x` and `y`), and `z` is assigned the value `3` by using a keyword argument. This way, you maintain the clarity and the required syntax.\n\nSo, while you can't directly intermix unpacked and positional arguments without named keywords following the unpacking, using keyword arguments for subsequent parameters is a simple and effective approach."
