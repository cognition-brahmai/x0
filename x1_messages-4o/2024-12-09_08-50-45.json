        "content": "To implement a function that returns the length of the longest increasing subarray in Python, you can iterate through the array while keeping track of the current increasing subarray's length and updating the maximum length found so far. Here's a sample implementation:\n\n```python\ndef longest_increasing_subarray(arr):\n    if not arr:\n        return 0\n\n    max_length = 1\n    current_length = 1\n\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        if arr[i] > arr[i - 1]:\n            current_length += 1\n        else:\n            max_length = max(max_length, current_length)\n            current_length = 1\n\n    # Check last subarray length\n    max_length = max(max_length, current_length)\n\n    return max_length\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nprint(longest_increasing_subarray(arr))  # Output: 5\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the array while comparing each element to its predecessor. If the current element is greater, it means the subarray is still increasing, so we increment the `current_length`. If it's not greater, we check if the `current_length` is the longest found so far and reset it to 1, indicating the start of a new potential subarray. Finally, we ensure to check the `max_length` one last time after the loop to account for an increasing sequence at the end of the array."
