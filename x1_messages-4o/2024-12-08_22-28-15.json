Each subsequent number is determined by a computation involving the previous number(s). If the 3rd number is 10 and the 4th number is 17, what computation was used to determine the 5th number? Provide the answer as a single integer."

This suggests that the differences form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2.\n\nAssuming this pattern continues, the next difference should be \\(7 + 2 = 9\\).\n\nTherefore, to find the 5th number:\n- Add 9 to the 4th number: \\(17 + 9 = 26\\)\n\nThus, the computation used to determine the 5th number yields the number \\(26\\)."
