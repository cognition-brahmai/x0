I am trying to create a Python dictionary that is going to be used as a JavaScript variable inside an HTML file for visualization purposes. Therefore, I need the dictionary to have all names inside double quotes, instead of the default single quotes used by Python. Is there an easy and elegant way to achieve this? Here's the code I'm currently working with:\n\n```python\ncouples = [\n    ['jack', 'ilena'], \n    ['arun', 'maya'], \n    ['hari', 'aradhana'], \n    ['bill', 'samantha']\n]\npairs = dict(couples)\nprint(pairs)\n```\n\nThe output I get from this code is:\n\n```python\n{'arun': 'maya', 'bill': 'samantha', 'jack': 'ilena', 'hari': 'aradhana'}\n```\n\nHowever, what I want is an output like this:\n\n```python\n{\"arun\": \"maya\", \"bill\": \"samantha\", \"jack\": \"ilena\", \"hari\": \"aradhana\"}\n```\n\nI know that `json.dumps(pairs)` converts the dictionary into a string which isn't what I'm looking for. Is there another way to do this using JSON, especially since I'm dealing with nested dictionaries?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired output where the dictionary keys and values are enclosed in double quotes, you can indeed use the `json` module in Python. Although `json.dumps()` converts the dictionary to a JSON-formatted string, this is actually what you want when embedding the dictionary in JavaScript or HTML. The JSON format is compatible with JavaScript objects, which typically use double quotes.\n\nHere's how you can use `json.dumps()` to convert your dictionary into a JSON string with double quotes:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ncouples = [\n    ['jack', 'ilena'], \n    ['arun', 'maya'], \n    ['hari', 'aradhana'], \n    ['bill', 'samantha']\n]\npairs = dict(couples)\n\n# Convert the dictionary to a JSON string with double quotes\njson_str = json.dumps(pairs)\n\n# Print the JSON string\nprint(json_str)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, `json.dumps()` will output a string that looks like this:\n\n```json\n{\"jack\": \"ilena\", \"arun\": \"maya\", \"hari\": \"aradhana\", \"bill\": \"samantha\"}\n```\n\nThis JSON string can be directly used in your JavaScript within an HTML file. Although `json.dumps()` returns a string representation of the dictionary, it is the correct approach for embedding data in HTML or JavaScript, as JSON is natively supported by JavaScript and is designed to be a data interchange format between languages."
