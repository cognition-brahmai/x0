I am currently using a basic method of plotting which is as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom pylab import *\nboxplot([1,2,3,4,5,10])\nshow()\n```\n\nThe image of the plot doesn't show in this question due to reputation constraints, but it basically produces a boxplot with Q1 at y=1, Q3 at y=5, and an outlier at y=10. I want to remove the outlier at y=10, so that the plot only shows from Q1 to Q3 (in this case from 1 to 5)."

        "content": "To hide the outliers when plotting a boxplot using Matplotlib, you can set the `showfliers` parameter to `False`. This parameter controls whether the outliers are displayed in the plot. Here is how you can modify your code to hide the outliers:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Sample data\ndata = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10]\n\n# Create the boxplot\nplt.boxplot(data, showfliers=False)\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nWith `showfliers=False`, the boxplot will not display any outliers, and you'll only see the box from Q1 to Q3 without the additional points beyond the whiskers."
