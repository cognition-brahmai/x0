        "content": "Your approach to selecting the last three columns and excluding the last three columns from a DataFrame using `pandas` is correct. Let's go through each of your steps to ensure everything is clear:\n\n1. **Selecting the Last Three Columns:**\n\n   ```python\n   y = dataframe.iloc[:, -3:]\n   ```\n\n   This line of code is correct. It uses `iloc` to slice the DataFrame, selecting all rows (`:`) and the last three columns (`-3:`).\n\n2. **Excluding the Last Three Columns:**\n\n   ```python\n   X = dataframe.iloc[:, :-3]\n   ```\n\n   This line is also correct. It selects all rows (`:`) and all columns except the last three (`:-3`).\n\nIf you're experiencing array dimensional errors further in your code, it's worth checking the following:\n\n- **Ensure Compatibility:** Make sure that the operations you're performing later in your code are compatible with the shapes of `X` and `y`. For instance, if you're concatenating or performing matrix operations, the dimensions need to align.\n\n- **Check for NaN Values:** Sometimes, operations can fail if there are NaN or missing values in the DataFrame. Ensure that `X` and `y` do not have unexpected NaN values that might cause issues.\n\n- **Data Types:** Verify that the data types of the columns in `X` and `y` are as expected and compatible with the operations you're performing.\n\n- **Shape and Dimensions:** Print the shapes of `X` and `y` using `X.shape` and `y.shape` to confirm their dimensions are as expected.\n\nIf you provide more details about the specific errors you're encountering, I can help troubleshoot further!"
