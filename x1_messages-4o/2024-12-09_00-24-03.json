I have a string like `'aa33bbb44'` and when I use `re.findall('\\d+',text)` it returns an array with all the matches as `['33', '44']`. I can extract the first element of this list with `re.findall('\\d+',text)[0]`, which gives me `'33'`. However, this approach only works if there is at least one match. If there are no matches, as in the case of a string like `'aazzzbbb'`, I get an `IndexError: list index out of range`. I could define a function to handle this scenario, but is there a way of obtaining the first match, or an empty string if no match exists, without defining a new function?"

        "content": "You can achieve this by using the `re.search()` function, which is designed to find the first match of your regular expression in the string. It returns a match object if a match is found, or `None` if no match is found. Here's how you can use it to achieve your goal:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ntext = 'aa33bbb44'\nmatch = re.search(r'\\d+', text)\n\nfirst_match = match.group(0) if match else ''\n\nprint(first_match)  # Output: '33'\n```\n\nIn this code, `re.search(r'\\d+', text)` looks for the first occurrence of one or more digits in the string. If a match is found, `match.group(0)` returns the matched string. If no match is found, `match` is `None`, and the expression `match.group(0) if match else ''` safely returns an empty string. This approach avoids the need to define a separate function for handling the case where no matches are found."
