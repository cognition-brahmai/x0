I've used the following code:\n\n```python\nimport pprint\npprint({})\n```\n\nHowever, I'm getting a TypeError stating that 'module' object is not callable. The full error message is:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"temp.py\", line 3, in <module>\n    pprint({})\nTypeError: 'module' object is not callable\n```\n\nWhy exactly is this module not callable?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is due to the way you're trying to use the `pprint` module. In your code, you imported the module `pprint`, but then tried to call it directly like a function. In Python, modules are not callable objects.\n\nTo use the `pprint` module to pretty print a dictionary, you need to use the `pprint` function within the `pprint` module. Here's how you can fix your code:\n\n```python\nimport pprint\n\npprint.pprint({})\n```\n\nIn this corrected code, `pprint.pprint` is calling the `pprint` function from the `pprint` module, which is the correct way to pretty print a dictionary or any other data structure in Python."
