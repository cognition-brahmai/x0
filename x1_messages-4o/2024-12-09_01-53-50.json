I've set up the site's url.py and login/urls.py, and the views in login/views.py. I've set the form action to {% url 'login:auth' %}, but it's causing an error when I try to load the page. The error is \"Reverse for 'auth' with arguments '()' and keyword arguments '{}' not found. 1 pattern(s) tried: [u'$auth/']\". The system seems to be unable to verify the username and password. However, if I change the url pattern to url(r'', views.auth, name='auth'), it works fine but sets the action as '/'. I've tried changing the login url pattern to url(r'^login/$', include('login.urls', namespace='login')), but it didn't help. What could be causing this issue and how can I resolve it?"

        "content": "The `NoReverseMatch` error you're encountering is typically due to a mismatch between the URL patterns defined in your Django application and the way you're trying to reference them using the `{% url %}` template tag. Let's break down the possible causes and solutions for this issue.\n\n### Possible Causes:\n1. **Namespace and URL Name**: The error suggests that Django is unable to find a URL pattern named `'auth'` within the `'login'` namespace. The issue might be with the way the namespace and URL name are defined or used.\n\n2. **URL Pattern Definition**: The URL pattern might not be defined correctly in your `urls.py` files.\n\n3. **Inclusion of URLs**: The way you include the `login.urls` in your main `urls.py` might not be correct, especially with regard to the namespace.\n\n### Steps to Resolve:\n\n1. **Check the URL Definition in `login/urls.py`**:\n   Make sure that you have defined a URL pattern with the name `'auth'`. It should look something like this:\n\n   ```python\n   # login/urls.py\n   from django.conf.urls import url\n   from . import views\n\n   urlpatterns = [\n       url(r'^auth/$', views.auth, name='auth'),\n   ]\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Inclusion in the Main `urls.py`**:\n   Ensure that you're including the `login.urls` with the correct namespace in your main `urls.py`:\n\n   ```python\n   # yourproject/urls.py\n   from django.conf.urls import include, url\n   from django.contrib import admin\n\n   urlpatterns = [\n       url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),\n       url(r'^login/', include('login.urls', namespace='login')),\n   ]\n   ```\n\n3. **Using the Template Tag Correctly**:\n   In your template, use the `{% url %}` tag correctly with both the namespace and the URL name:\n\n   ```html\n   <form action=\"{% url 'login:auth' %}\" method=\"post\">\n       <!-- your form fields here -->\n   </form>\n   ```\n\n4. **Check Django Version**:\n   Since you're using Django 1.6, ensure you are correctly using the syntax and features available in that version. Some later features might not be available or might work differently.\n\n5. **Clear Cache and Restart**:\n   Sometimes, Django's URL routing can be affected by caching. Try restarting your development server and clearing any template cache.\n\n6. **Review URL Patterns**:\n   Ensure there are no typos or misunderstandings in the regular expressions used in your URL patterns.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `NoReverseMatch` error and have your login form submit to the correct URL."
