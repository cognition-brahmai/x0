        "content": "To create a Python program that accepts multiple lines of user input, you can use a loop to continuously read input from the user until a specific condition is met, such as entering a blank line or a specific keyword like \"END\". Here's a simple example that demonstrates how to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef read_multiline_input():\n    print(\"Enter multiple lines of input (type 'END' on a new line to finish):\")\n    lines = []\n    while True:\n        line = input()\n        if line.strip().upper() == 'END':\n            break\n        lines.append(line)\n    return \"\\n\".join(lines)\n\nuser_input = read_multiline_input()\nprint(\"You entered:\")\nprint(user_input)\n```\n\nIn this example, the user is prompted to enter multiple lines of text. The input is collected in a list until the user types \"END\" on a new line, which signifies the end of input. The list of lines is then joined into a single string with newline characters (`\\n`) and returned.\n\nYou can modify the code to use a different keyword or condition for ending the input if you prefer."
