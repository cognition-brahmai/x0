        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `set().union(x)` expects its arguments to be hashable. However, in your case, `x` is a list of sets, and sets themselves are not hashable, hence the error.\n\nTo find the union of a list of sets, you need to unpack the list using the `*` operator, which will pass each set in the list as a separate argument to the `union` method. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nx = [{1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 4}, {3, 4, 5}]\nresult = set().union(*x)\nprint(result)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n```\n\nBy using the `*` operator, `set().union(*x)` is effectively calling `set().union({1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 4}, {3, 4, 5})`, which correctly computes the union of all the sets in the list."
