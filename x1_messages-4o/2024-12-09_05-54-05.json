        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering, `ssl.SSLError: [SSL: TLSV1_ALERT_PROTOCOL_VERSION] tlsv1 alert protocol version`, indicates that there is a mismatch between the SSL/TLS protocol versions supported by your client and the server. This often happens when the server requires a newer version of TLS than is being used in your request.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Update Python**: You're using Python 3.5, which may not support the latest TLS versions. Updating Python to a newer version (3.7 or later) which supports more recent TLS protocols like TLS 1.2 and 1.3 is recommended.\n\n2. **Use `requests` library**: Instead of the `http.client` module, use the `requests` library which handles SSL/TLS more gracefully. It's more user-friendly and often better at handling SSL/TLS protocol negotiation.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use the `requests` library:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth\n\n# API endpoint\nurl = 'https://0.0.0.0/api/config/v1/aaa/users'\n\n# Make a GET request with Basic Authentication\nresponse = requests.get(url, auth=HTTPBasicAuth('admin', 'password'), verify=False)\n\n# Print the response data\nprint(response.text)\n```\n\n3. **Install the `requests` library**: If you haven't already, install the `requests` library using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\n4. **SSL Verification**: The `verify=False` argument in the `requests.get()` method disables SSL certificate verification. This is useful for testing but not recommended for production use due to security risks. If the server's certificate is self-signed or if you're testing, you can use it, but otherwise, you should provide a valid certificate or leave it out for secure connections.\n\n5. **Update OpenSSL**: Ensure that OpenSSL is updated on your system. This can sometimes be handled by updating your operating system or by specifically updating the OpenSSL package.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the SSL/TLS version issue and successfully make the API request to the Cisco CMX device."
