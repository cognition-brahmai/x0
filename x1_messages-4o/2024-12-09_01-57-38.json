        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to incorrect usage of boolean indexing and parentheses in your code. When filtering a DataFrame using multiple conditions, each condition should be enclosed in parentheses. Additionally, you should not use nested DataFrame indexing within the condition.\n\nHere's how you can correct your code:\n\n```python\nq1_fisher_r[(q1_fisher_r['TP53'] == 1) & (q1_fisher_r['TumorST'].str.contains(':1:'))]\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- Ensure each condition is wrapped in its own set of parentheses.\n- The `&` operator is used to combine multiple conditions, and each condition should return a boolean Series of the same length as the DataFrame.\n- The condition `q1_fisher_r['TP53'] == 1` checks for rows where the `TP53` column has a value of 1.\n- The condition `q1_fisher_r['TumorST'].str.contains(':1:')` checks for rows where the `TumorST` column contains the substring `':1:'`.\n\nBy fixing the parentheses and removing the unnecessary nested DataFrame indexing, your code should now work without throwing a `TypeError`."
