        "content": "I am trying to use the super() function in combination with @staticmethod in Python but encountering an error. I have two classes, 'First' and 'Second', where 'Second' is a subclass of 'First'. Both classes have a staticmethod 'getlist'. In the 'Second' class, I am trying to call the 'getlist' method from the 'First' class using super(). My code is as follows:\n\n```python\nclass First(object):\n  @staticmethod\n  def getlist():\n    return ['first']\n\nclass Second(First):\n  @staticmethod\n  def getlist():\n    l = super(Second).getlist()\n    l.append('second')\n    return l\n\na = Second.getlist()\nprint a\n```\n\nHowever, I am facing an AttributeError: 'super' object has no attribute 'getlist', which is shown below:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"asdf.py\", line 13, in &lt;module&gt;\n    a = Second.getlist()\n  File \"asdf.py\", line 9, in getlist\n    l = super(Second).getlist()\nAttributeError: 'super' object has no attribute 'getlist'\n```\n\nIf I change the staticmethods to classmethods and pass the class instance to super(), things work fine. Could you help me understand if I am calling super(type) incorrectly or if there is something I'm missing?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering arises from the way `super()` works in conjunction with static methods. The `super()` function is designed to work with instance methods and class methods, but not with static methods, because static methods do not take a reference to the class or instance as a first argument. \n\nHere's a breakdown of why you're seeing the error:\n\n1. **Static Methods**: These methods do not receive an implicit first argument. You can call a static method without creating an instance of the class, and it does not have access to the instance (`self`) or class (`cls`) from which it is called.\n\n2. **Super and Static Methods**: When you use `super()`, it expects a reference to either an instance or a class, which it uses to resolve the method to call. In the case of static methods, there is no such reference, so `super()` cannot be used directly to resolve the method.\n\nTo achieve what you're trying to do, you can either switch to using class methods or directly reference the parent class's static method. Here\u2019s how you can do it with each approach:\n\n### Using Class Methods\n\nChange the static methods to class methods and use `super()`:\n\n```python\nclass First(object):\n    @classmethod\n    def getlist(cls):\n        return ['first']\n\nclass Second(First):\n    @classmethod\n    def getlist(cls):\n        l = super(Second, cls).getlist()\n        l.append('second')\n        return l\n\na = Second.getlist()\nprint(a)\n```\n\n### Directly Calling the Parent Static Method\n\nIf you want to stick with static methods, directly call the parent class's static method:\n\n```python\nclass First(object):\n    @staticmethod\n    def getlist():\n        return ['first']\n\nclass Second(First):\n    @staticmethod\n    def getlist():\n        l = First.getlist()  # Directly call the static method of the parent class\n        l.append('second')\n        return l\n\na = Second.getlist()\nprint(a)\n```\n\nBy using these approaches, you can properly manage method inheritance and avoid the `AttributeError` you encountered."
