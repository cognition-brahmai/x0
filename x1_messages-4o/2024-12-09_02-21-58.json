When I tried using `my_copy = my_dict.copy()`, I found that changes in `my_dict` are also reflected in `my_copy`. For instance, in the following lines of code:\n\n```\n>>> my_dict = {'a': [1, 2, 3], 'b': [4, 5, 6]}\n>>> my_copy = my_dict.deepcopy()\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nAttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'deepcopy'\n>>> my_copy = my_dict.copy()\n>>> my_dict['a'][2] = 7\n>>> my_copy['a'][2]\n7\n```\nThe last line should return `3`, but it's returning `7` instead. How can I make such modifications in `my_dict` without impacting the snapshot `my_copy`?"

        "content": "To create a deep copy of a dictionary in Python, especially when the dictionary contains nested objects like lists, you should use the `copy` module's `deepcopy` function. The method `copy()` that you tried creates a shallow copy, meaning that it copies the references to the nested objects, not the objects themselves. Therefore, changes to mutable objects like lists within the original dictionary will affect the copied dictionary as well.\n\nHere's how you can create a deep copy using the `copy` module:\n\n```python\nimport copy\n\nmy_dict = {'a': [1, 2, 3], 'b': [4, 5, 6]}\nmy_copy = copy.deepcopy(my_dict)\n\n# Now, modifying the original dictionary won't affect the deep copy\nmy_dict['a'][2] = 7\nprint(my_copy['a'][2])  # This will print 3\n```\n\nIn this code, `copy.deepcopy(my_dict)` creates a new dictionary where all the nested objects are also recursively copied, so changes to the nested objects in the original dictionary do not affect the copied dictionary."
