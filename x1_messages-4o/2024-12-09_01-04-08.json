According to an older answer, the homebrew function was faster, however, upon running my own tests, the results suggest that `scipy.misc.comb` is now faster. I have used a time profiling test to measure the performance of both functions. Did the time profiling test show that the new `scipy.misc.comb` is faster than the homemade `choose()` function? Is there an error in my test script that could lead to inaccurate timing? Why might `scipy.misc.comb` be faster now, could it be due to `cython` or `c` wrapping tricks?"

        "content": "To determine if `scipy.misc.comb` is indeed faster than your homebrew function, it's crucial to ensure that your time profiling test is accurate and fair. Here are a few considerations and potential reasons for the observed performance difference:\n\n1. **Ensure Fair Comparison**: \n   - Make sure the inputs to both functions are identical during each test run.\n   - Use a suitable method for time measurement, such as `timeit` module, which minimizes the overhead and provides a reliable benchmark by running the code snippet multiple times.\n\n2. **Implementation Details**:\n   - `scipy.misc.comb` might have been optimized in recent versions of SciPy. If it uses Cython or C extensions under the hood, it can significantly speed up computations compared to a pure Python implementation, especially for large inputs.\n   - Check the version of SciPy you're using, as performance improvements could have been made in recent updates.\n\n3. **Potential Errors in the Test Script**:\n   - Ensure that the setup of the timing test is correct, and there is no overhead or other operations mixed into the timing.\n   - Make sure that any caching or side effects (such as memoization) are accounted for and consistent across both implementations.\n   - If multithreading or multiprocessing is involved, ensure that timing isn't affected by other processes running concurrently.\n\n4. **Profiling and Cython/C Wrapping**:\n   - If `scipy.misc.comb` utilizes Cython or directly interfaces with C libraries, this could explain the speedup due to more efficient memory management and processing at a lower level than Python.\n   - Investigate the source code or documentation of `scipy.misc.comb` to understand its current implementation.\n\nIf the test is set up correctly and you still observe that `scipy.misc.comb` is faster, it's likely due to optimizations in the library's implementation, possibly leveraging Cython or other performance-enhancing techniques."
