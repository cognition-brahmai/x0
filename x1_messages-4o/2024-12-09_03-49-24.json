Despite this, Eclipse still lists Pydev as being installed. This is quite strange to me. For installation, I used the standard method (Through the \"install new software\" option under help). Can someone guide me on how to resolve this issue?"

Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve this problem:\n\n1. **Check Installed Software**: Go to `Help` -> `About Eclipse` -> `Installation Details`, and ensure that PyDev is listed there. If it is not listed, try reinstalling it. \n\n2. **Reset Perspective**: Sometimes resetting the perspective can help. Go to `Window` -> `Perspective` -> `Reset Perspective` and see if PyDev shows up after that.\n\n3. **Open Perspective Manually**: Try opening the PyDev perspective manually by going to `Window` -> `Perspective` -> `Open Perspective` -> `Other...` and see if PyDev is listed there. If it is, select it and open.\n\n4. **Check Eclipse Version Compatibility**: Ensure that the version of PyDev you installed is compatible with your version of Eclipse. Sometimes updates can cause compatibility issues.\n\n5. **Eclipse Workspace**: There could be a problem with your current workspace. Try creating a new workspace and see if PyDev appears there.\n\n6. **Reinstall PyDev**: Sometimes, the installation might not have completed correctly. Try uninstalling PyDev and then reinstalling it:\n   - Go to `Help` -> `Eclipse Marketplace` -> Installed.\n   - Find PyDev in the list and uninstall it.\n   - Restart Eclipse.\n   - Install PyDev again using the Eclipse Marketplace or the \"Install New Software\" option.\n\n7. **Check Error Log**: Go to `Window` -> `Show View` -> `Error Log` and check for any errors that might give you more information about what went wrong during the installation.\n\n8. **Consider Alternative Installations**: If none of the above solutions work, consider installing PyDev using an offline method or through the Eclipse Marketplace client if you haven't tried that yet.\n\n9. **Update Eclipse**: Ensure your Eclipse IDE is updated to the latest version as sometimes bugs are resolved in newer versions.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and get PyDev to appear in your list of perspectives. If the problem persists, consider reaching out to the Eclipse or PyDev community forums for more specific guidance related to your setup."
