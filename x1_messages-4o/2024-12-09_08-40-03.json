I am trying to learn more about regular expressions and saw in a tutorial that I can use \\b to match a word boundary. However, when I use it in my Python code, it doesn't work as expected. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nx = 'one two three'\ny = re.search(\"\\btwo\\b\", x)\n```\n\nThis code should return a match object if there is a match, but it's returning None. Is \\b not supported in Python or am I using it incorrectly?"

        "content": "Yes, Python's `re` module does support the use of word boundaries (`\\b`). The word boundary `\\b` is used to match the position between a word character and a non-word character. However, the issue you're encountering is likely due to not using a raw string for your regular expression pattern.\n\nIn Python, backslashes (`\\`) are used as escape characters in strings, so when you use them in a regular expression, it's best to use a raw string to ensure that the backslashes are interpreted correctly by the regular expression engine. You can create a raw string by prefixing the string with `r`.\n\nHere is how you can modify your code to use a raw string:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nx = 'one two three'\ny = re.search(r\"\\btwo\\b\", x)\n\nif y:\n    print(\"Match found:\", y.group())\nelse:\n    print(\"No match found.\")\n```\n\nBy using `r\"\\btwo\\b\"`, you're ensuring that `\\b` is interpreted as a word boundary by the `re` module, and this should work as expected to find the word \"two\" in the string."
