For instance, if my list of words is [\"tree\", \"bone\", \"indigo\", \"developer\"], the expected frequency count for each letter would be {a:0, b:1, c:0, d:2, e:3, f:0, g:1, h:0, i:1, j:0, k:0, l:1, m:0, n:2, o:3, p:1, q:0, r:2, s:0, t:1, u:0, v:1, w:0, x:0, y:0, z:0}. I tried implementing an algorithm in Python, but it's incomplete and I need help to finalize it."

        "content": "To count the frequency of each letter in a list of words, ensuring that each letter in a word is only counted once regardless of how many times it appears, you can use a Python script to achieve this. Below is a step-by-step implementation:\n\n```python\ndef count_letter_frequency(words):\n    # Initialize a dictionary with all letters set to 0\n    frequency = {chr(i): 0 for i in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1)}\n    \n    # Loop through each word in the list\n    for word in words:\n        # Create a set of unique letters in the word\n        unique_letters = set(word.lower())\n        \n        # Increment the frequency count for each unique letter\n        for letter in unique_letters:\n            if letter in frequency:  # Ensure the letter is a valid alphabet character\n                frequency[letter] += 1\n    \n    return frequency\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"tree\", \"bone\", \"indigo\", \"developer\"]\nfrequency_count = count_letter_frequency(words)\nprint(frequency_count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initialize the Frequency Dictionary:**\n   - We create a dictionary `frequency` with keys as all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', each initialized to 0. This will store the frequency count of each letter.\n\n2. **Iterate Through Each Word:**\n   - For each word in the list, convert it to lowercase (to ensure case insensitivity) and create a set of unique letters using `set(word.lower())`.\n\n3. **Update Frequency Counts:**\n   - For each unique letter in the set, check if it is a valid alphabet character (i.e., within 'a' to 'z'). If it is, increment its count in the `frequency` dictionary.\n\n4. **Return the Frequency Count:**\n   - After processing all words, return the `frequency` dictionary containing the frequency count of each letter.\n\nThis code will provide you with the desired frequency count for each letter in the list of words, counting each unique letter only once per word."
