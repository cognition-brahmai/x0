Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Define the two timestamps as strings\ntimestamp1 = \"2010-01-01 17:31:22\"\ntimestamp2 = \"2010-01-03 17:31:22\"\n\n# Convert the string timestamps to datetime objects\nformat = \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"\ndatetime1 = datetime.strptime(timestamp1, format)\ndatetime2 = datetime.strptime(timestamp2, format)\n\n# Calculate the difference between the two datetime objects\ndifference = datetime2 - datetime1\n\n# Get the difference in minutes\ndifference_in_minutes = difference.total_seconds() / 60\n\nprint(f\"The difference between the two timestamps is {difference_in_minutes} minutes.\")\n```\n\nThis script uses the `strptime` method to convert the string representations of the timestamps into `datetime` objects. Then, it calculates the difference between these two `datetime` objects, which results in a `timedelta` object. The `total_seconds()` method of the `timedelta` object is used to get the difference in seconds, and dividing by 60 converts it into minutes."
