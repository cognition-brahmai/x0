I'm encountering a syntax error after the 'if' in 'else if', which I'm unable to resolve. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef function(a):\n    if a == '1':\n        print ('1a')\n    else if a == '2':\n        print ('2a')\n    else print ('3a')\n\nfunction(input('input:'))\n```\nWhat is the correct way to use 'else if' in Python 3.1.1?"

        "content": "In Python, the `else if` construct is written as `elif`. This is consistent across Python 2 and Python 3, so the syntax remains the same even after transitioning from Python 2.6.4 to Python 3.1.1. Here's how you can correct your code:\n\n```python\ndef function(a):\n    if a == '1':\n        print('1a')\n    elif a == '2':  # Use 'elif' instead of 'else if'\n        print('2a')\n    else:\n        print('3a')  # Don't forget the colon at the end of the else statement\n\nfunction(input('input:'))\n```\n\nThe `elif` keyword is used to check multiple expressions for TRUE and execute a block of code as soon as one of the conditions evaluates to TRUE. If none of the conditions are TRUE, the `else` block will be executed. Also, ensure that the colons are correctly placed at the end of the `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements."
