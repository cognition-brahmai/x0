        "content": "To remove duplicates from a list while preserving the order of elements, you can use a combination of a list and a set. The set will help you track which elements have already been seen, and the list will maintain the order. Here's a Pythonic way to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates_preserve_order(input_list):\n    seen = set()\n    result = []\n    for item in input_list:\n        if item not in seen:\n            seen.add(item)\n            result.append(item)\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\noriginal_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 1, 6, 3]\nunique_list = remove_duplicates_preserve_order(original_list)\nprint(unique_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nThis function iterates through each element in the input list. If the element hasn't been seen before (i.e., it's not in the `seen` set), it gets added to both the `seen` set and the `result` list. This way, the relative order of the first occurrence of each element is preserved."
