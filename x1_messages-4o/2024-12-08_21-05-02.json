        "content": "### Explanation of Naive Bayes Algorithm\n\n#### Overview\nNaive Bayes is a family of probabilistic algorithms based on Bayes' Theorem, which is primarily used for classification tasks. It's termed \"naive\" because it assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is independent of the presence of any other feature (feature independence assumption).\n\n#### Bayes' Theorem\nThe foundation of Naive Bayes is Bayes' Theorem, which is expressed as:\n\n\\[ P(C|X) = \\frac{P(X|C) \\cdot P(C)}{P(X)} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( P(C|X) \\) is the posterior probability of class \\( C \\) given the predictor \\( X \\).\n- \\( P(X|C) \\) is the likelihood, which is the probability of predictor \\( X \\) given class \\( C \\).\n- \\( P(C) \\) is the prior probability of class \\( C \\).\n- \\( P(X) \\) is the prior probability of predictor \\( X \\).\n\nFor text classification, the model calculates the probability of each class given a document and assigns the class with the highest probability.\n\n#### Naive Bayes for Text Classification\nIn text classification, the predictors are the words in the document. Given a document, Naive Bayes computes the posterior probability for each class and assigns the class with the highest probability to the document. Mathematically, for a document with words \\( w_1, w_2, ..., w_n \\) and class \\( C \\), the probability is given by:\n\n\\[ P(C|w_1, w_2, ..., w_n) \\propto P(C) \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(w_i|C) \\]\n\n#### Handling Imbalanced Datasets\nNaive Bayes can handle imbalanced datasets by adjusting the prior probabilities \\( P(C) \\). However, it might not always be effective as the algorithm inherently assumes equal class distribution. Techniques like oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, or using a different evaluation metric like F1-score can be employed to mitigate the impact of imbalance.\n\n### Comparison with Other Text Classification Algorithms\n\n1. **Logistic Regression**\n   - **Accuracy:** Generally provides better accuracy than Naive Bayes on larger datasets.\n   - **Efficiency:** Computationally efficient but might be slower than Naive Bayes due to iterative optimization.\n   - **Interpretability:** Coefficients provide insights into feature importance, making it more interpretable.\n\n2. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**\n   - **Accuracy:** High accuracy, especially in high-dimensional spaces.\n   - **Efficiency:** Computationally intensive, especially with large datasets.\n   - **Interpretability:** Less interpretable compared to linear models due to the complexity of decision boundaries.\n\n3. **Decision Trees**\n   - **Accuracy:** Can be less accurate due to overfitting, but ensemble methods like Random Forests improve this.\n   - **Efficiency:** Efficient on smaller datasets but can be slow on large datasets.\n   - **Interpretability:** Highly interpretable as the decision path is easy to follow.\n\n4. **Deep Learning (e.g., CNN, RNN)**\n   - **Accuracy:** High accuracy, especially for large and complex datasets.\n   - **Efficiency:** Computationally expensive and requires significant resources.\n   - **Interpretability:** Often considered a \"black box,\" making it hard to interpret.\n\n### Sample Code for Text Classification using Naive Bayes\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom nltk.stem import SnowballStemmer\nimport nltk\n\n# Download stopwords\nnltk.download('stopwords')\n\n# Sample data\ndata = {'text': ['I love programming', 'Python is amazing', 'I hate bugs', 'Debugging is fun', 'I enjoy learning AI'],\n        'label': ['positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive']}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Preprocessing function to remove stop words and apply stemming\ndef preprocess_text(text):\n    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n    stemmer = SnowballStemmer('english')\n    words = text.split()\n    words = [stemmer.stem(word) for word in words if word.lower() not in stop_words]\n    return ' '.join(words)\n\n# Applying preprocessing\ndf['text'] = df['text'].apply(preprocess_text)\n\n# Split data\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df['text'], df['label'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Build pipeline\npipeline = Pipeline([\n    ('vectorizer', CountVectorizer()),\n    ('classifier', MultinomialNB())\n])\n\n# Hyperparameter tuning\nparam_grid = {\n    'vectorizer__ngram_range': [(1, 1), (1, 2)],\n    'classifier__alpha': [0.5, 1.0, 1.5]\n}\n\ngrid_search = GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid, cv=3, n_jobs=-1, verbose=1)\ngrid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Evaluate\nbest_pipeline = grid_search.best_estimator_\ny_pred = best_pipeline.predict(X_test)\n\nprint(\"Best Parameters:\", grid_search.best_params_)\nprint(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n1. **Data Preparation:** A sample dataset is created with text and corresponding labels.\n2. **Preprocessing:** A function is defined to remove stop words and apply stemming using NLTK's SnowballStemmer.\n3. **Splitting Data:** The data is split into training and test sets.\n4. **Pipeline:** A pipeline is set up, including a `CountVectorizer` for text vectorization and `MultinomialNB` classifier.\n5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Grid search is used to find the best n-gram range and smoothing parameter (`alpha`) for the Naive Bayes classifier.\n6. **Evaluation:** The best model is used to predict the test set, and a classification report is printed to evaluate performance.\n\nThis code demonstrates how to implement Naive Bayes for text classification with the inclusion of stemming, stop word removal, and hyperparameter tuning for enhanced performance."
