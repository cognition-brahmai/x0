When I start my Rstudio session, I run the following lines of code:\n\n```R\nlibrary(reticulate)\nuse_python(\"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages\")\n```\nBut when I run `py_config()`, it still shows the default Python 2.7 installation. Because of this, I am unable to import any modules that were installed for Python3. Can you help me understand why this isn't working even though I am following the documentation closely?"

        "content": "It seems like you're trying to set the Python path using the `use_python()` function, but it's not taking effect. Let's go through some troubleshooting steps to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Correct Path**: Double-check that the path you provided (`/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages`) points to the Python binary, not the site-packages directory. The path should typically end in `/bin/python3.6` or similar, depending on your setup.\n\n2. **Set Python Path Before Loading Reticulate**: Make sure to set the Python path before loading the `reticulate` library. You can do this by setting the `RETICULATE_PYTHON` environment variable in your R script before loading the library:\n\n   ```r\n   Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = \"/usr/local/bin/python3.6\")\n   library(reticulate)\n   ```\n\n3. **Check for Virtual Environments**: If you're using a virtual environment, make sure to activate it using the `use_virtualenv()` function instead:\n\n   ```r\n   use_virtualenv(\"/path/to/your/virtualenv\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Restart R Session**: After making changes to the environment variables or configuration, restart your R session to ensure that the changes take effect.\n\n5. **Verify Python Installation**: Confirm that the Python installation at the specified path is correct and has the necessary modules installed. You can do this by running Python from the terminal and checking the version and installed packages.\n\n6. **Check RStudio Settings**: Sometimes, RStudio can have its own Python settings that override your script. Check the RStudio settings under Tools -> Global Options -> Python and ensure it's set to use the version you specified.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to configure Reticulate to use the desired Python version. If the issue persists, double-check the paths and configurations to ensure everything is set up correctly."
