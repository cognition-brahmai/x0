But when I use the 'round' function, the result is not as expected. Here is what I tried:\n\n```python\na = 13.949999999999999\nprint(round(a, 2))\n```\n\nThis code still prints '13.949999999999999' and not '13.95'. How can I correctly limit the float to two decimal points?"

        "content": "In Python, the `round` function should correctly round the number to the specified number of decimal places. However, when printing the result, you might still see more decimal places due to how floating-point numbers are represented in memory. To ensure that the output is formatted to two decimal places, you can use Python's string formatting methods. Here are a few ways to do it:\n\n1. **Using f-strings (Python 3.6 and above):**\n\n   ```python\n   a = 13.949999999999999\n   print(f\"{a:.2f}\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Using the `format` method:**\n\n   ```python\n   a = 13.949999999999999\n   print(\"{:.2f}\".format(a))\n   ```\n\n3. **Using the `round` function with string formatting:**\n\n   ```python\n   a = 13.949999999999999\n   a_rounded = round(a, 2)\n   print(f\"{a_rounded:.2f}\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Using the `%` operator:**\n\n   ```python\n   a = 13.949999999999999\n   print(\"%.2f\" % a)\n   ```\n\nAll these methods will ensure that the output is formatted as `13.95`. The key is to use string formatting to control the display of the number, which can help in presenting it in a user-friendly way with the desired number of decimal places."
