The dataframe looks like this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf=pd.read_table(fname)\n```\n\nThe column names are `Time, Time Relative, N2, Time, Time Relative, H2, etc...` and all the `Time` and `Time Relative` columns contain the same data. I would like to remove these duplicate columns and only keep `Time, Time Relative, N2, H2`.\n\nI have tried the following code:\n\n```python\ndf=df.T.drop_duplicates().T\n```\n\nHowever, this results in an error: `Reindexing only valid with uniquely valued index objects`.\n\nI am using Pandas version 0.9.0, Python Version 2.7.3 on Windows 7, installed via Pythonxy 2.7.3.0. The columns in the data file are separated by tabs. How can I efficiently remove these duplicate columns from my dataframe?"

        "content": "To remove duplicate columns from a DataFrame in pandas when the columns have the same name, you can use the following approach. Since you\u2019re using an older version of pandas, ensure that your methods are compatible. The error you're encountering is because the operation you're using assumes a unique index, which is not the case here.\n\nHere's one way to handle this:\n\n1. Read the file into a DataFrame.\n2. Identify and drop duplicate columns by checking their content and names.\n\nHere's a step-by-step implementation:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read your file into a DataFrame\ndf = pd.read_table(fname)\n\n# Get a list of the column names\ncol_names = df.columns\n\n# Create a set for tracking seen columns\nseen = set()\n\n# List for storing columns to keep\nkeep_cols = []\n\n# Iterate over the column names\nfor col in col_names:\n    # Convert the column to a tuple of its values for comparison\n    col_tuple = tuple(df[col])\n    \n    # Check if this column has already been seen\n    if col_tuple not in seen:\n        seen.add(col_tuple)\n        keep_cols.append(col)  # If not, add to keep list\n\n# Create a new DataFrame with only the unique columns\ndf_unique = df[keep_cols]\n\n# Display the resulting DataFrame\nprint(df_unique)\n```\n\nThis approach uses a set to keep track of already seen columns by their content, which allows you to keep only one instance of columns that have identical data. This should work for your use case, given the constraints and version limitations."
