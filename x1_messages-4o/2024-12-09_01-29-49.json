I am not able to understand why the task assignment changes the time of output of error. Can someone explain this?"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is related to how asyncio handles exceptions in tasks and the lifecycle of tasks in an event loop.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening:\n\n1. **Unhandled Exceptions in Tasks**: In asyncio, if a task raises an exception and the exception is not handled, it is stored in the task until it is retrieved. If the exception is not retrieved, asyncio will log a warning when the event loop is closed, indicating that the exception was never retrieved. This is what you're seeing with the message \"Task exception was never retrieved\".\n\n2. **Immediate Error Message**: When you use `loop.create_task(exc())` without assigning it to any variable, the task is created and starts running. Since there is no reference to the task, the exception is raised, but asyncio doesn't have any explicit place to store or check the exception immediately. The event loop continues to run, and since there is nothing to keep track of the task, the warning is logged immediately.\n\n3. **Delayed Error Message upon Assignment**: When you assign the task to a variable like `task = loop.create_task(exc())`, you are keeping a reference to the task. The exception still occurs in the task just as before, but now asyncio knows that there's a reference to the task, and it waits to log the warning until the task object is garbage collected or until the event loop is stopped and closed. When you press Ctrl+C, the loop stops, and then the warning is logged because the task has not been awaited or checked for an exception.\n\nTo handle this properly, you should ensure that any exceptions in tasks are handled. Here's how you could modify your code to handle the exception:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def exc():\n    try:\n        print(1 / 0)\n    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n        print(f\"Caught an exception: {e}\")\n\nloop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\ntask = loop.create_task(exc())\n\ntry:\n    loop.run_forever()\nexcept KeyboardInterrupt:\n    loop.stop()\n    loop.close()\n```\n\nThis way, the exception is caught and handled within the coroutine, and you won't see the \"Task exception was never retrieved\" warning."
