The Amazon S3 REST API documentation mentions a size limit of 5GB for upload in a single PUT operation, and that larger files need to be uploaded using multipart. Since there's no direct rename or move operation, I need to copy the file to a new location and delete the old one. How can this be done for files larger than 5GB? Do I need to execute a multipart upload from the bucket to itself? If so, how can the file be split into parts? I am using boto and it doesn't seem to automatically handle files larger than 5GB. Is there any built-in support for this that I might have overlooked?"

        "content": "When dealing with files larger than 5GB in Amazon S3, you indeed need to use the multipart upload feature, as S3 does not support a direct rename or move operation. Here's how you can handle this using the Boto3 library in Python, which provides built-in support for multipart uploads:\n\n### Steps to Copy a Large File in Amazon S3 using Boto3\n\n1. **Initiate a Multipart Upload:**\n   Begin by initiating a multipart upload, which allows you to upload a large object as a set of parts.\n\n2. **Copy Parts:**\n   Use the `upload_part_copy` method to copy parts of the file from the source object to the destination. This is done by specifying byte ranges.\n\n3. **Complete the Multipart Upload:**\n   Once all parts have been copied, complete the multipart upload to finalize the copy.\n\nHere's a sample code to illustrate the process:\n\n```python\nimport boto3\n\ns3_client = boto3.client('s3')\n\ndef copy_large_file(source_bucket, source_key, dest_bucket, dest_key):\n    # Initiate a multipart upload\n    response = s3_client.create_multipart_upload(Bucket=dest_bucket, Key=dest_key)\n    upload_id = response['UploadId']\n\n    # Get the size of the source file\n    source_object = s3_client.head_object(Bucket=source_bucket, Key=source_key)\n    source_size = source_object['ContentLength']\n\n    # Define part size and calculate number of parts\n    part_size = 5 * 1024 * 1024  # 5 MB\n    num_parts = (source_size // part_size) + (1 if source_size % part_size != 0 else 0)\n\n    try:\n        parts = []\n        for part_number in range(1, num_parts + 1):\n            # Calculate byte range for each part\n            start = (part_number - 1) * part_size\n            end = min(start + part_size - 1, source_size - 1)\n\n            # Copy part from source to destination\n            copy_source = {\n                'Bucket': source_bucket,\n                'Key': source_key\n            }\n            part = s3_client.upload_part_copy(\n                Bucket=dest_bucket,\n                Key=dest_key,\n                PartNumber=part_number,\n                UploadId=upload_id,\n                CopySource=copy_source,\n                CopySourceRange=f'bytes={start}-{end}'\n            )\n            parts.append({'ETag': part['CopyPartResult']['ETag'], 'PartNumber': part_number})\n\n        # Complete the multipart upload\n        s3_client.complete_multipart_upload(\n            Bucket=dest_bucket,\n            Key=dest_key,\n            MultipartUpload={'Parts': parts},\n            UploadId=upload_id\n        )\n    except Exception as e:\n        # Abort the multipart upload in case of failure\n        s3_client.abort_multipart_upload(Bucket=dest_bucket, Key=dest_key, UploadId=upload_id)\n        raise e\n\n# Example usage\ncopy_large_file('source-bucket-name', 'source-key', 'destination-bucket-name', 'destination-key')\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Multipart Upload:** This is necessary for handling files larger than 5GB.\n- **Copy by Parts:** Each part is copied individually using byte-range specifications.\n- **Handle Failures:** Always ensure that multipart uploads are either completed or aborted to avoid incurring storage costs for incomplete uploads.\n\n### Cleanup:\nAfter the copy operation is successful, you can delete the original file if needed.\n\nUsing this approach, you can efficiently manage large file operations in S3 using Boto3."
