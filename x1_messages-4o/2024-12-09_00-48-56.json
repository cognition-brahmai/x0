        "content": "To add a title and axis labels to your Seaborn heatmap, you can use Matplotlib's `pyplot` functions. After creating the heatmap with Seaborn, you can set the title and labels using `plt.title()`, `plt.xlabel()`, and `plt.ylabel()`. Here's how you can modify your code snippet to include these features:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Assuming 'a1' is your DataFrame and it's already defined\na1_p = a1.pivot_table(index='Postcode', columns='Property Type', values='Count', aggfunc=np.mean, fill_value=0)\n\n# Create the heatmap\nsns.heatmap(a1_p, cmap=\"YlGnBu\")\n\n# Add a title and axis labels\nplt.title('Average Property Count by Type and Postcode')\nplt.xlabel('Property Type')\nplt.ylabel('Postcode')\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `plt.title('...')` sets the title of the heatmap plot.\n- `plt.xlabel('...')` sets the label for the x-axis.\n- `plt.ylabel('...')` sets the label for the y-axis.\n- `plt.show()` displays the plot with the added title and labels in your iPython Notebook environment.\n\nMake sure to import `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt` if you haven't already, as it's necessary for these additional plotting functions."
