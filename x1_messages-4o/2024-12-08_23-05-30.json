        "content": "To efficiently compute the median of a massive dataset containing millions of integer values, we can design a streaming algorithm that leverages a divide-and-conquer strategy with a focus on space and time efficiency. One such approach is the \"Median of Medians\" algorithm, which is a deterministic linear-time selection algorithm.\n\n### Algorithm Design:\n\n1. **Data Stream Handling**: Since the dataset is massive, we can assume it's being processed in a streaming fashion or stored in a distributed system like Hadoop or Spark.\n\n2. **Two Heaps Approach**:\n   - Use two heaps to keep track of the lower and upper halves of the dataset.\n   - A max-heap for the lower half to store the smaller elements.\n   - A min-heap for the upper half to store the larger elements.\n   \n3. **Insertion**:\n   - For each element in the dataset, decide which heap it should go to:\n     - If the element is smaller than the maximum of the max-heap, insert it into the max-heap.\n     - Otherwise, insert it into the min-heap.\n\n4. **Balancing**:\n   - Ensure the heaps are balanced:\n     - The max-heap can have at most one more element than the min-heap.\n     - If the max-heap has more than one extra element, move the root of the max-heap to the min-heap.\n     - If the min-heap has more elements, move the root of the min-heap to the max-heap.\n\n5. **Median Calculation**:\n   - If the max-heap has more elements, the median is the root of the max-heap.\n   - If both heaps are of equal size, the median is the average of the roots of the two heaps.\n\n### Implementation Scenario:\n\n**Scenario: Real-time Monitoring of Sensor Data**\n\nIn a smart city infrastructure project, millions of sensors are deployed throughout the city to monitor environmental parameters like temperature, humidity, and pollution levels in real-time. The data is streamed continuously to a central system for analysis.\n\n- **Challenge**: The system needs to compute the median temperature in real-time to trigger alerts for anomalous conditions.\n\n- **Implementation**:\n  - The real-time data stream is fed into a distributed computing framework (e.g., Apache Kafka for data ingestion and Apache Flink or Spark Streaming for processing).\n  - The two heaps approach is implemented within the streaming application, allowing it to compute the median on-the-fly as data arrives.\n  - By maintaining the heaps, the system can provide real-time insights without the need to store all data points, thus optimizing both memory usage and computational time.\n\n- **Optimization**:\n  - Parallel processing is used to handle multiple data streams simultaneously.\n  - The system is benchmarked to ensure low latency, providing median calculations within milliseconds of data arrival.\n\nThis approach demonstrates an efficient and scalable solution for computing the median in massive datasets, making it ideal for real-time analytics in various domains."
