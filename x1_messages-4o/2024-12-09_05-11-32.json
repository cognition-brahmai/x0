However, I understand that this is not how you would use Python's `sum` function. How can I sum up the second column in a Pythonic or functional way?"

        "content": "To calculate the sum of the second column in a functional way, you can use Python's built-in `map` function along with `sum`. The `map` function can apply a transformation function to each element of the iterable, and then `sum` can be used to add up the resulting values. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ntable = [\n    (\"marley\", \"5\"),\n    (\"bob\", \"99\"),\n    (\"another name\", \"3\")\n]\n\n# Use map to transform the second column to integers, then sum them\ntotal = sum(map(lambda tup: int(tup[1]), table))\n\nprint(total)  # Output: 107\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `map(lambda tup: int(tup[1]), table)` applies a lambda function to each tuple in the `table`, converting the second element from a string to an integer.\n- `sum(...)` then adds up all the integer values produced by `map`.\n\nThis approach is both functional and Pythonic."
