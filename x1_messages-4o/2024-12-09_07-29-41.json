        "content": "To convert an integer timestamp like `1485714600` into a human-readable datetime format in Python, you can use the `datetime` module. Specifically, you'll want to use `datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp()` to convert the Unix timestamp into a `datetime` object. Then, you can format that object to your desired string format using `strftime()`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\n# Your Unix timestamp\ntimestamp = 1485714600\n\n# Convert the timestamp to a datetime object\ndt_object = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp)\n\n# Format the datetime object to your desired format\nformatted_date = dt_object.strftime(\"%A, %B %d, %Y %I:%M:%S %p\")\n\nprint(formatted_date)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nMonday, January 30, 2017 12:00:00 AM\n```\n\nMake sure that the timestamp you are using represents seconds since the epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC). The `fromtimestamp()` function interprets the input as seconds, so if your timestamp is in milliseconds, you'll need to divide it by 1000 first."
