Each instance has CUDA 7.5, Anaconda Python 3.5, and Pycuda 2016.1.1 installed. I have a Python-Pycuda project which runs perfectly on my local Spark installation on my Mac, but when I try to run it on AWS, I encounter a FileNotFoundError stating that 'nvcc' is not found. This issue persists despite having set the CUDA_HOME and CUDA_ROOT environment variables in /etc/bash.bashrc and being able to access nvcc from the command line for the ubuntu user, the root user, and the yarn user on all four machines. Could you suggest what might be the issue and how to resolve it?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing with the 'nvcc' not being found on your AWS EC2 cluster, despite setting `CUDA_HOME` and `CUDA_ROOT`, may be due to the environment variables not being recognized by the Spark executors or not being properly propagated to them. Here are some steps to help troubleshoot and resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Environment Variables in Spark Configuration:**\n   Ensure that the environment variables are set for Spark executors. This can be done by setting the `spark.executorEnv` configuration in your Spark job submission. You can specify these in your Spark-submit command:\n   ```bash\n   spark-submit \\\n   --conf \"spark.executorEnv.CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda\" \\\n   --conf \"spark.executorEnv.PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda/bin\" \\\n   ... # other spark-submit configurations\n   ```\n\n2. **Profile and Environment Setup:**\n   Double-check that the environment variables are sourced correctly. Sometimes, environment variables set in `/etc/bash.bashrc` might not be sourced in non-interactive shells used by Spark workers. You can try setting them in `/etc/profile` or `/etc/environment` as well.\n\n3. **YARN Container Environment:**\n   Since you are using YARN, ensure that the environment variables are also configured in YARN's configuration. Edit the `yarn-site.xml` and add the following properties:\n   ```xml\n   <property>\n       <name>yarn.nodemanager.env-whitelist</name>\n       <value>CUDA_HOME,CUDA_ROOT,PATH</value>\n   </property>\n   ```\n\n4. **Path Verification:**\n   Verify that the `nvcc` binary is indeed located in the directory specified by `CUDA_HOME` or `CUDA_ROOT`. For example, it should be in `/usr/local/cuda/bin`.\n\n5. **Permissions:**\n   Ensure that the `nvcc` binary and its directory have the appropriate permissions for all users that need access to it.\n\n6. **Cluster Restart:**\n   After making changes to environment variables or configuration files, ensure that you restart the relevant services or the entire cluster to apply the changes.\n\n7. **Testing:**\n   Run a simple test script on all nodes that checks if `nvcc` can be accessed. This will help confirm if the issue is with a specific node or configuration.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `FileNotFoundError` related to `nvcc` not being found on your AWS EC2 cluster."
