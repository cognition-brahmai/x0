For instance, I want a number like 0.022499999999999999 to round up to 0.03 and a number like 0.1111111111111000 to round up to 0.12. Essentially, if there is any value in the third decimal place, I want it to always round up, leaving me with two values behind the decimal point. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To round up a number to the second decimal place in Python, you can use the `math.ceil` function in combination with some arithmetic operations to achieve the desired rounding behavior. Here is how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef round_up_to_2_decimal_places(number):\n    # Multiply the number by 100 to shift the decimal point two places to the right\n    # Use math.ceil to round up to the nearest integer\n    # Divide by 100 to shift the decimal point back to its original position\n    return math.ceil(number * 100) / 100\n\n# Test cases\nprint(round_up_to_2_decimal_places(0.022499999999999999))  # Output: 0.03\nprint(round_up_to_2_decimal_places(0.1111111111111000))    # Output: 0.12\n```\n\nThis function works by multiplying the number by 100 to shift the decimal point to the right, then using `math.ceil` to round up to the nearest whole number. Finally, it divides by 100 to shift the decimal back to the original position, effectively rounding up to the second decimal place."
