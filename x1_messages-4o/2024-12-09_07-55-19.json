        "content": "In Pandas, to perform an element-wise logical OR operation, you should use the `|` operator. This operator works similarly to the `&` operator for AND operations but is used for OR operations instead.\n\nWhen using `|`, make sure that you enclose conditions in parentheses to ensure proper precedence. Here is an example:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    'A': [True, False, True, False],\n    'B': [False, False, True, True]\n})\n\n# Element-wise logical OR\nresult = df['A'] | df['B']\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n0     True\n1    False\n2     True\n3     True\ndtype: bool\n```\n\nIn this example, the `|` operator is used to perform an element-wise OR operation between the columns 'A' and 'B'."
