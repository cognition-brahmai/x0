        "content": "To find all the prime numbers within a given range, you can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which is an efficient way to identify prime numbers. Here's a simple Python program that implements this algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef sieve_of_eratosthenes(start, end):\n    # Initialize a list to track prime status of numbers\n    prime = [True for _ in range(end + 1)]\n    p = 2\n\n    while (p * p <= end):\n        # If prime[p] is not changed, it is a prime\n        if prime[p]:\n            # Updating all multiples of p to not prime\n            for i in range(p * p, end + 1, p):\n                prime[i] = False\n        p += 1\n\n    # Collecting all prime numbers in the specified range\n    prime_numbers = []\n    for p in range(max(2, start), end + 1):\n        if prime[p]:\n            prime_numbers.append(p)\n\n    return prime_numbers\n\n# Example usage\nstart_range = 10\nend_range = 50\nprimes = sieve_of_eratosthenes(start_range, end_range)\nprint(f\"Prime numbers between {start_range} and {end_range}: {primes}\")\n```\n\nThis code snippet defines a function `sieve_of_eratosthenes` that takes a start and an end number for the range. It initializes a list `prime` where each index corresponds to a number and is marked as True if it's a prime, otherwise False. The algorithm then iterates through the list, marking multiples of each prime number starting from 2 as False. Finally, it collects and returns all the prime numbers within the specified range.\n\nYou can change the `start_range` and `end_range` variables to test other ranges."
