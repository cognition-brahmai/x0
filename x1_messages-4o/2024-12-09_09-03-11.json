        "content": "Certainly! Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to perform Bubble Sort on a given array:\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation\n\n1. **Start with the Array:**\n   Consider an array of `n` elements that you want to sort in ascending order.\n\n2. **Outer Loop:**\n   The outer loop runs from the first element to the second-to-last element. It ensures that every element is bubbled up to its correct position after each pass.\n\n3. **Inner Loop:**\n   The inner loop runs from the first element to the last unsorted element. This loop compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.\n\n4. **Swapping:**\n   During each pass through the inner loop, if the current element is greater than the next element, swap them. This process will push the largest unsorted element to its correct position at the end of the array.\n\n5. **Repeat:**\n   Repeat the process for all elements, reducing the unsorted part of the array by one element after each pass since the largest element of the unsorted section is placed at the end. \n\n6. **Optimization (Optional):**\n   You can optimize the algorithm by adding a flag that checks if any swaps were made during a pass through the array. If no swaps were made, the array is already sorted, and you can terminate early.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's say we have an array `[5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]`. Here's how Bubble Sort would work on this array:\n\n1. **First Pass:**\n   - Compare 5 and 2, swap \u2192 `[2, 5, 9, 1, 5, 6]`\n   - Compare 5 and 9, no swap \u2192 `[2, 5, 9, 1, 5, 6]`\n   - Compare 9 and 1, swap \u2192 `[2, 5, 1, 9, 5, 6]`\n   - Compare 9 and 5, swap \u2192 `[2, 5, 1, 5, 9, 6]`\n   - Compare 9 and 6, swap \u2192 `[2, 5, 1, 5, 6, 9]`\n\n2. **Second Pass:**\n   - Compare 2 and 5, no swap \u2192 `[2, 5, 1, 5, 6, 9]`\n   - Compare 5 and 1, swap \u2192 `[2, 1, 5, 5, 6, 9]`\n   - Compare 5 and 5, no swap \u2192 `[2, 1, 5, 5, 6, 9]`\n   - Compare 5 and 6, no swap \u2192 `[2, 1, 5, 5, 6, 9]`\n\n3. **Third Pass:**\n   - Compare 2 and 1, swap \u2192 `[1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]`\n   - Compare 2 and 5, no swap \u2192 `[1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]`\n   - Compare 5 and 5, no swap \u2192 `[1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]`\n\n4. **Fourth Pass:**\n   - Compare 1 and 2, no swap \u2192 `[1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]`\n\nSince no swaps were made in the last pass, the array is sorted: `[1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBubble Sort is easy to implement but not efficient for large datasets, as its average and worst-case time complexity is \\(O(n^2)\\). Despite this, it's a great way to understand basic sorting concepts."
