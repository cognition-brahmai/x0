The code is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef foo(foo_input):\n    if 0 <= foo_input <= 100:\n        return foo_input\n```\nThis function returns 'None' if `foo_input` is greater than 100. Is there a way for it to not return anything at all, or does a function always have to return something?"

        "content": "In Python, every function returns a value, even if it's not explicitly stated. If a function doesn't have a return statement or if the return statement is without an expression, it implicitly returns `None`. This means that a Python function cannot avoid returning something; it will always return `None` if no other return value is specified.\n\nIn your example, when `foo_input` is greater than 100, the function reaches the end without hitting any return statement, so it returns `None` by default. If you want to indicate that no value should be returned when `foo_input` is outside the desired range, you can handle it explicitly, but it will still return `None`.\n\nHere's an example of how you could modify your code to make it clear when no useful value is returned:\n\n```python\ndef foo(foo_input):\n    if 0 <= foo_input <= 100:\n        return foo_input\n    # Optionally, you could add a return statement explicitly returning None\n    # return None\n```\n\nThis is perfectly normal and expected behavior in Python. If you want to handle the case where the function returns `None`, you can check for it when you call the function:\n\n```python\nresult = foo(150)\nif result is None:\n    print(\"Input was out of range.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Valid input: {result}\")\n```\n\nThis way, you manage what happens when the input is out of the desired range."
