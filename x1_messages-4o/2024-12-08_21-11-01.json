The code is hidden in a matrix with 4 rows and 4 columns. Each cell contains a number from 0 to 9.\nBut cracking the code won't be easy. You'll need to use your deductive skills and apply the following rules: add 3 to each even number and subtract 2 from each odd number in the matrix. \nOnce you have applied the rules, you'll need to add up all the numbers in the matrix to reveal the code. \nAre you ready to accept the challenge and put your spy skills to the test? Remember, time is ticking and you only have one chance to get it right!"
