I've attempted to do this using the following code:\n\n```python\npd.isnull(mys).all()\n```\n\nThe output I got was `True`. Is this the correct approach to determine if all values in a pandas Series are NaN?"

        "content": "Yes, your approach is correct for determining if all values in a pandas Series are NaN. The function `pd.isnull(mys)` returns a boolean Series where each element is `True` if the corresponding element in `mys` is NaN. By chaining `.all()`, you check if all elements in this boolean Series are `True`. If they are, it means all values in the original Series are NaN, and `pd.isnull(mys).all()` will return `True`, which is the desired outcome.\n\nSo, your code effectively checks if all values in the Series `mys` are NaN, and the output `True` confirms this."
