So I uninstalled ansible through pip using `sudo pip uninstall ansible` and reinstalled the latest dev version from the github repo using the classic setup.py method, which seemed to end successfully. However, when I tried using it, I couldn't find the Ansible command. The output for `ansible --version` and `which ansible` returns \"command not found\". I checked where it is installed and found that it is installed in `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages`, and indeed in there I find an egg: `ansible-2.4.0-py2.7.egg`. When I started Python and checked the site-packages folder, I found a different folder. Also, this folder is a symlink to the same folder where Ansible is installed. I'm guessing the problem is that no symlink is created to the Ansible package in `/usr/local/bin/`. But I'm unsure how I could create such a symlink and why it wouldn't appear in the first place. Does anybody know how I can move forward from here?"

        "content": "It sounds like the Ansible installation process didn't create the necessary symlinks in `/usr/local/bin/` for you to access Ansible commands directly from the terminal. This can happen if the installation script doesn't properly link the executable scripts. Let's go through the steps to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify Python Version**: First, make sure you are using the correct version of Python. Since Ansible is installed for Python 2.7, ensure that your default Python version is 2.7. You can check your Python version with `python --version`.\n\n2. **Locate Ansible Executables**: Find the location of the Ansible executables. They are typically located within the `bin/` directory of the Ansible package in the site-packages directory. Check if there are any Ansible executable scripts in `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible-2.4.0-py2.7.egg/bin/`.\n\n3. **Create Symlinks Manually**: If the executables are present, you can create symlinks manually. First, navigate to your Ansible `bin/` directory:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible-2.4.0-py2.7.egg/bin/\n   ```\n\n   Then, create symlinks for the Ansible commands you need, such as `ansible`, `ansible-playbook`, etc., using:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo ln -s $(pwd)/ansible /usr/local/bin/ansible\n   sudo ln -s $(pwd)/ansible-playbook /usr/local/bin/ansible-playbook\n   # Repeat for any other Ansible commands you need\n   ```\n\n4. **Update PATH**: Ensure your `/usr/local/bin/` directory is included in your `PATH` environment variable. You can check this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   echo $PATH\n   ```\n\n   If `/usr/local/bin/` is not in your `PATH`, you can add it by editing your shell's configuration file (like `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bashrc`, or `~/.zshrc`), adding the following line:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\"\n   ```\n\n   After editing the file, reload it with:\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bash_profile  # or source ~/.bashrc, or source ~/.zshrc, depending on your shell\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify Installation**: Now, try running `ansible --version` again to see if the command is recognized.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to use Ansible commands directly from your terminal.
