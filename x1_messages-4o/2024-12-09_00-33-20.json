I currently have the following code, but it does not achieve what I want:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nfrom django.utils import timezone\n\nEASTERN_NOW = timezone.localtime(timezone.now() + timedelta(minutes=30))\n\nTIME = datetime.time(EASTERN_NOW.time().hour, EASTERN_NOW.time().minute).strftime(\n    VALID_TIME_FORMATS[2])\n```\n\nI would like the `TIME` variable to represent the current time, rounded up to the nearest half hour (for example: 12:00PM or 12:30PM)."

        "content": "To round the current time up to the nearest 30 minutes, you can make use of Python's `datetime` and perform some arithmetic operations. Here's a modified version of your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nfrom django.utils import timezone\n\n# Get the current time in the desired timezone\nEASTERN_NOW = timezone.localtime(timezone.now())\n\n# Calculate the minutes to add to round up to the nearest 30 minutes\nminutes_to_add = (30 - EASTERN_NOW.minute % 30) % 30\n\n# Add the calculated minutes to the current time\nrounded_time = EASTERN_NOW + timedelta(minutes=minutes_to_add)\n\n# Define your desired time format\nVALID_TIME_FORMATS = [\"%I:%M %p\", \"%H:%M\", \"%I:%M%p\"]\n\n# Format the rounded time\nTIME = rounded_time.strftime(VALID_TIME_FORMATS[2])\n\nprint(TIME)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what this code does:\n- It calculates how many minutes need to be added to reach the next multiple of 30. This is done by calculating the remainder of the current minute when divided by 30 (`EASTERN_NOW.minute % 30`) and subtracting it from 30.\n- If the current minute is already a multiple of 30, no additional minutes are added (`% 30` ensures this).\n- The `timedelta` with the calculated minutes is added to the current time to get the rounded-up time.\n- Finally, the rounded time is formatted using your desired format.\n\nThis will ensure that the `TIME` variable is set to either the current hour or half-past, depending on the current time."
