Could you provide an example of how to structure the code?\n[Mark down]\nTo effectively demonstrate the cause-and-effect relationship in a JavaScript function, you can use comments with \"therefore\", \"consequently\", and \"as a result\" to explain each step of the process. For example:\n```\nfunction calculateProfit(sales, expenses) {\n    // Calculate the profit by subtracting expenses from sales\n    const profit = sales - expenses;\n    // Therefore, if the sales are higher than the expenses, there will be a positive profit\n    // Consequently, if the expenses are higher than the sales, there will be a negative profit\n    // As a result, the profit will be zero if the sales and expenses are equal\n    return profit;\n}\n```"
