        "content": "You can interleave two lists in Python using a variety of methods. One straightforward way is to use a list comprehension along with the `zip` function. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3]\nlist2 = [10, 20, 30]\n\ninterleaved_list = [item for pair in zip(list1, list2) for item in pair]\n\nprint(interleaved_list)\n```\n\nThis code works as follows:\n\n1. `zip(list1, list2)` pairs up elements from `list1` and `list2`. It produces an iterator of tuples where each tuple contains one element from each list.\n2. The list comprehension `[item for pair in zip(list1, list2) for item in pair]` iterates through each tuple (`pair`) produced by `zip` and then iterates through each item in the tuple, adding it to the resulting list.\n\nThe output will be:\n\n```\n[1, 10, 2, 20, 3, 30]\n```\n\nThis method efficiently interleaves the two lists as desired."
