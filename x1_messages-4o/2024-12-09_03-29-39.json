I achieved this by installing MinGW and creating a `distutils.cfg` file with the following content:\n```[build]\ncompiler = mingw32\n```\nHowever, I would like to utilize pip for its various benefits. How can I configure pip to use MinGW's gcc compiler to compile C code when I run `pip install <package name>`? Currently, I am receiving an error that states: `Unable to find vcvarsall.bat`. It seems like pip is not aware of the gcc compiler."

        "content": "To configure `pip` to use MinGW's GCC compiler for compiling C extensions, you'll need to ensure that the `distutils` configuration is recognized by `pip`. The error `Unable to find vcvarsall.bat` typically arises because `pip` defaults to using Microsoft's Visual C++ compiler on Windows systems. Here's how you can configure `pip` to use MinGW:\n\n1. **Ensure MinGW is in PATH**: Make sure that the path to the MinGW `bin` directory is added to your system's PATH environment variable. This allows the system to locate the MinGW tools easily.\n\n2. **Modify `distutils.cfg`**:\n   Since you already have a `distutils.cfg` file, ensure it is located in the correct directory. Typically, it should be in the `distutils` directory under your Python installation. For example:\n   ```\n   C:\\PythonXX\\Lib\\distutils\\distutils.cfg\n   ```\n   Make sure the content is as follows:\n   ```ini\n   [build]\n   compiler = mingw32\n   ```\n\n3. **Set Environment Variables**:\n   Sometimes, additional environment variables might help `pip` recognize the MinGW compiler. You can set the `DISTUTILS_USE_SDK` and `MSSdk` environment variables:\n   ```cmd\n   set DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1\n   set MSSdk=1\n   ```\n\n4. **Install a Compatible Package**:\n   Some packages provide pre-compiled binaries or wheels that are compatible with Windows. Before compiling, see if the package is available in wheel format for your Python version and architecture by using:\n   ```\n   pip install <package-name> --only-binary=:all:\n   ```\n\n5. **Use `--global-option`**:\n   When installing a package with `pip`, you can specify the compiler using the `--global-option` flag. For example:\n   ```cmd\n   pip install <package-name> --global-option=build_ext --global-option=\"-IC:\\MinGW\\include\" --global-option=\"-LC:\\MinGW\\lib\"\n   ```\n\n6. **Custom Build Command**:\n   If the package's `setup.py` supports it, you can use a custom build command:\n   ```cmd\n   python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32 install\n   ```\n\n7. **Verify Installation**:\n   After configuring, try installing a simple package with C extensions to test if `pip` uses MinGW.\n\n8. **Check for Compatibility Issues**:\n   Some packages may have specific requirements for the compiler or might not support being compiled with MinGW. Check the package documentation or issues for any guidance.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to configure `pip` to use MinGW's gcc compiler for compiling C extensions on Windows."
