Here are the relevant details:\n- Mozart was born on January 27th, 1756\n- He composed Symphony No. 41 in 1788\n- Symphony No. 41 is believed to have been completed when Mozart was in his mid-30s\nPlease include the Python code that you would use to calculate Mozart's age when he composed Symphony No. 41."

        "content": "Certainly! To calculate Mozart's age when he composed Symphony No. 41, we can simply determine the difference in years between the year he composed the symphony (1788) and his birth year (1756). Here's how you can do it in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Mozart's birthdate\nbirth_date = datetime(1756, 1, 27)\n\n# Year when Symphony No. 41 was composed\ncomposition_year = 1788\n\n# Calculate age\nage = composition_year - birth_date.year\n\nprint(f\"Mozart was {age} years old when he composed Symphony No. 41.\")\n```\n\nThis script will output:\n\n```\nMozart was 32 years old when he composed Symphony No. 41.\n```\n\nThis calculation is straightforward as we are only considering the years and not the specific months or days within those years. Since Symphony No. 41 was completed in 1788 and Mozart was born in 1756, Mozart was indeed in his early 30s, specifically 32 years old, when he completed the symphony."
