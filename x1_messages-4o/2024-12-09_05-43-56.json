The filenames are formatted as follows:\n\n```\nminiseries.season 1.part 5.720p.avi\nminiseries.part 5.720p.avi\nminiseries.part VII.720p.avi     # episode or season expressed in Roman numerals\n```\n\nThe \"season XX\" part may or may not be present and it may be written in a shortened form like \"s 1\" or \"seas 1\". I need to capture four groups of data from these filenames:\n\n```\ngroup1 : miniseries\ngroup2 : 1 (or None)\ngroup3 : 5\ngroup4 : 720p.avi\n```\n\nI have attempted this with the following regex:\n\n```\n(.*)(?:s[eason ]*(\\d{1,2}|[ivxlcdm]{1,5}))?.*p[art ]*(\\d{1,2}|[ivxlcdm]{1,5}).*(.*$)\n```\n\nThis regex only works when the filename is fully specified, including the optional \"season XX\" string. How can I modify my regex to return \"None\" as group2 if \"season\" is not found in the filename?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired extraction using regular expressions, you need a regex pattern that correctly identifies and optionally matches the \"season\" part while ensuring that it captures \"None\" when the season is not present. Your current regex pattern can be improved for this purpose.\n\nHere's a revised regex pattern that should work for your requirements:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\npattern = r'^(.*?)\\.(?:s(?:eason|eas)?\\s*(\\d{1,2}|[ivxlcdm]{1,5}))?\\.\\s*p(?:art)?\\s*(\\d{1,2}|[ivxlcdm]{1,5})\\.(.*)$'\n\nfilenames = [\n    \"miniseries.season 1.part 5.720p.avi\",\n    \"miniseries.part 5.720p.avi\",\n    \"miniseries.part VII.720p.avi\"\n]\n\nfor filename in filenames:\n    match = re.match(pattern, filename, re.IGNORECASE)\n    if match:\n        group1, group2, group3, group4 = match.groups()\n        print(f\"Group 1: {group1}, Group 2: {group2}, Group 3: {group3}, Group 4: {group4}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No match found\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Group 1**: `^(.*?)\\.` - This captures the series name (everything before the first dot).\n\n2. **Group 2**: `(?:s(?:eason|eas)?\\s*(\\d{1,2}|[ivxlcdm]{1,5}))?` - This optionally matches the \"season\" part:\n   - `(?:...)` is a non-capturing group used to apply `?` to the whole \"season\" part.\n   - `s(?:eason|eas)?` matches \"season\", \"seas\", or \"s\", accounting for optional variations.\n   - `\\s*` allows for optional spaces.\n   - `(\\d{1,2}|[ivxlcdm]{1,5})` captures the season number in either Arabic or Roman numerals.\n\n3. **Group 3**: `\\s*p(?:art)?\\s*(\\d{1,2}|[ivxlcdm]{1,5})` - This captures the part number:\n   - `p(?:art)?` matches \"part\" or \"p\".\n   - `\\s*` allows for optional spaces.\n   - `(\\d{1,2}|[ivxlcdm]{1,5})` captures the part number in either Arabic or Roman numerals.\n\n4. **Group 4**: `\\.(.*)$` - This captures everything after the part number, which includes the resolution and file extension.\n\nThis pattern should work for various formats of your filenames and correctly capture the four groups, with \"None\" for group 2 when the season is not present."
