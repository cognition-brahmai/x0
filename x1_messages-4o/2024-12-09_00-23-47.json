Currently, I am using an if-else statement to check if the \"host\" key is in the dictionary and then assigning the value to a variable. If the \"host\" key is not present, I assign a default value to the variable. Here is the code snippet:\n\n```python\nif \"host\" in connectionDetails:\n    host = connectionDetails[\"host\"]\nelse:\n    host = someDefaultValue\n```\n\nCould you suggest a more efficient way to write this code?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can make your code more concise and \"pythonic\" by using the `get` method of a dictionary. The `get` method allows you to specify a default value that will be returned if the key is not found in the dictionary. Here's how you can refactor your code:\n\n```python\nhost = connectionDetails.get(\"host\", someDefaultValue)\n```\n\nThis single line of code achieves the same result as your if-else statement. If the \"host\" key exists in the dictionary, `host` will be assigned its value. If not, `host` will be assigned the `someDefaultValue`."
