I built a web-based interpreter using Twisted.web where Python code is submitted through a form, and executed by the client. I want to create a simple popup message without having to write a lot of wxPython or TkInter code. I've tried `tkMessageBox` but it opens another window in the background with a tk icon, which I don't want. Is there any simple way to create a message box in Python without setting up a class and entering an app loop?\n\n```python\nimport tkMessageBox\ntkMessageBox.showinfo(title=\"Greetings\", message=\"Hello World!\")\n```"

        "content": "Creating a simple message box in Python without a lot of setup can be a bit challenging since most GUI libraries like Tkinter or wxPython require some initialization and event loop handling. However, you can use the `tkinter` module in a more minimal way to achieve a simple message box without leaving a lingering window. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\nfrom tkinter import messagebox\n\ndef show_message(title, message):\n    # Create a root window\n    root = tk.Tk()\n    # Hide the root window\n    root.withdraw()\n    # Show the message box\n    messagebox.showinfo(title, message)\n    # Destroy the root window\n    root.destroy()\n\n# Usage\nshow_message(\"Greetings\", \"Hello World!\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Root Window Creation:** We create a root window using `tk.Tk()`.\n- **Hiding the Root Window:** The `withdraw()` method is used to hide the main window, so it doesn't appear on the screen.\n- **Displaying the Message Box:** We use `messagebox.showinfo()` to display the alert-like message box.\n- **Destroying the Root Window:** Finally, we destroy the root window using `destroy()` to ensure it doesn't linger after the message box is closed.\n\nThis approach keeps the code minimal and avoids displaying an unwanted main window."
