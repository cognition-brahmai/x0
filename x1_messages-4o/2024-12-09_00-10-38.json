However, implementing self-care practices in daily life can be challenging. This puzzle challenges you to decode a message that outlines some simple yet effective strategies for practicing self-care.\nThe message is encrypted using a substitution cipher, where each letter in the message is replaced with another letter. The key for the cipher is provided below:\nKey:\nA = F\nB = K\nC = Z\nD = W\nE = R\nF = T\nG = L\nH = Y\nI = M\nJ = N\nK = Q\nL = X\nM = S\nN = E\nO = V\nP = U\nQ = O\nR = G\nS = B\nT = A\nU = J\nV = H\nW = D\nX = I\nY = P\nZ = C\nCan you use your knowledge of substitution ciphers to decode the following message?\nXMT NLMXLMW ZIIRERH TELIRXRMT, E SVZRM HZGZMGVH LU GSV YVZIGZRMW GZIVNV.
