Even though the folder and files have 755 permissions and I have also tested it with 777 permissions, I am not able to execute without using sudo. Are my settings incorrect or is there any other reason for this issue?\n\nThe error occurs when I execute the following code:\n```python\ncris-mbp:ProjectFolder cris$ python3 zbo.py \nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"zbo.py\", line 9, in &lt;module&gt;\n    app.run(host=\"127.0.0.1\",port=81,debug=True)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/flask/app.py\", line 843, in run\n    run_simple(host, port, self, **options)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/werkzeug/serving.py\", line 677, in run_simple\n    s.bind((hostname, port))\nPermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied\n```\n\nHowever, it runs fine when I use sudo:\n```python\ncris-mbp:ProjectFolder cris$ sudo python3 zbo.py \n * Running on http://127.0.0.1:81/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)\n * Restarting with stat\n * Debugger is active!\n * Debugger pin code: 106-133-233\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to the fact that on many Unix-like systems, including macOS, ports below 1024 are considered \"privileged\" ports. This means that only processes with superuser (root) permissions can bind to these ports. When you attempt to run your Flask application on port 81 without using `sudo`, you receive a \"PermissionError\" because your user account does not have the necessary permissions to bind to a privileged port.\n\nHere are a few solutions to consider:\n\n1. **Use a Non-Privileged Port**: You can run your Flask application on a port that's above 1024. For development purposes, it's common to use ports like 5000 or 8080:\n\n   ```python\n   app.run(host=\"127.0.0.1\", port=5000, debug=True)\n   ```\n\n2. **Port Forwarding**: If you need to use a port below 1024, you can use port forwarding to forward a higher, non-privileged port to a lower, privileged port. This can be done using the `iptables` command on Linux or using `pfctl` on macOS. On macOS, you can forward a port using `pfctl` as follows:\n\n   - Edit the `/etc/pf.conf` file (you may need to use `sudo` to edit this file) and add a rule like:\n\n     ```\n     rdr pass on lo0 inet proto tcp from any to any port 81 -> 127.0.0.1 port 5000\n     ```\n\n   - Reload the `pfctl` configuration:\n\n     ```bash\n     sudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf\n     sudo pfctl -e\n     ```\n\n3. **Run as Root (Not Recommended)**: You can continue to run your application with `sudo`, but this is generally not recommended for development purposes because it can lead to security risks, especially if your application has vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Use a Reverse Proxy**: In production environments, it's common to use a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache to handle requests on ports 80 or 443 and forward them to your Flask application running on a higher port.\n\nFor development purposes, using a non-privileged port is the simplest and safest solution."
