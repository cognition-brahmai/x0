I've noticed that, despite having more characters and typically being slower than try/except, both when an error is raised and when it's not, contextlib.suppress is still being used. I've included some timeit tests below for reference:\n\n```python\n# Python 3.5.0 (v3.5.0:374f501f4567, Sep 13 2015, 02:27:37) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32\n\n# Importing required module\nfrom timeit import timeit\n\n# With an error\ntimeit(\"\"\"with suppress(ValueError):\n    x = int('a')\"\"\", setup=\"from contextlib import suppress\")\n# Output: 1.9571568971892543\n\ntimeit(\"\"\"try:\n    x = int('a')\nexcept ValueError:\n    pass\"\"\")\n# Output: 1.0758466499161656\n\n# With no error\ntimeit(\"\"\"with suppress(ValueError):\n    x = int(3)\"\"\", setup=\"from contextlib import suppress\")\n# Output: 0.7513525708063895\n\ntimeit(\"\"\"try:\n    x = int(3)\nexcept ValueError:\n    pass\"\"\")\n# Output: 0.10141028937128027\n```"

        "content": "The choice between using `contextlib.suppress` and a traditional `try/except` block with a `pass` statement often comes down to readability and intent rather than performance. Here are a few reasons why someone might prefer `contextlib.suppress` despite its slightly higher overhead:\n\n1. **Readability and Clarity**: \n   - `contextlib.suppress` makes it explicit that the code is designed to ignore certain exceptions. This can make the code more readable and easier to understand at a glance, as it conveys intent more directly than a `try/except` block.\n   - It reduces boilerplate code when you want to suppress exceptions without handling them, which can help in keeping the code clean and focused on the primary logic.\n\n2. **Consistency and Style**:\n   - In some codebases, using `contextlib.suppress` might be a style choice to maintain consistency. If a team or a project decides to use it for specific cases, it helps in maintaining a uniform code style.\n   - It indicates a \"fire and forget\" mentality for exceptions, which might align with certain design philosophies or practices within a project.\n\n3. **Scoping**:\n   - `contextlib.suppress` can be advantageous when you want to suppress exceptions over a larger block of code without nesting multiple `try/except` blocks. It can help in managing the scope of exception handling more elegantly.\n\n4. **Functionality**:\n   - `contextlib.suppress` is designed to be used as a context manager, making it a good fit for scenarios where context managers are being used extensively, helping to keep the style consistent across the code.\n\n5. **Explicit is Better than Implicit**:\n   - According to the Zen of Python, \"Explicit is better than implicit.\" Using `suppress` makes it explicit that the exception is intentionally being ignored, whereas a `try/except` with a `pass` might sometimes be misinterpreted as an oversight or an incomplete implementation.\n\nWhile it's true that `try/except` can be more performant in certain cases, especially in tight loops or performance-critical sections of code, the trade-off with `contextlib.suppress` is often in favor of clearer and more maintainable code. In practice, the performance difference is usually negligible for most applications unless the code is being executed in a highly performance-sensitive context."
