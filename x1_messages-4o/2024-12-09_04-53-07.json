        "content": "In Python, there's no direct equivalent to the `GOTO` statement found in languages like BATCH or BASIC. Python is designed to encourage readable and structured code, which generally avoids the use of unstructured jumps like `GOTO`. However, you can achieve similar behavior using functions, loops, and conditionals. Here are some approaches:\n\n1. **Using Functions:**\n   You can encapsulate the code you want to jump to in a function and call it when needed.\n\n   ```python\n   def task_on_line_18():\n       # Code that starts on line 18\n       print(\"Jumped to line 18!\")\n\n   # Code on line 5\n   print(\"On line 5\")\n\n   # Jump to line 18\n   task_on_line_18()\n   ```\n\n2. **Using Loops and Conditional Statements:**\n   You can use loops with conditional checks to simulate the logic of `GOTO`.\n\n   ```python\n   line = 5\n\n   while line <= 18:\n       if line == 5:\n           print(\"On line 5\")\n           # Jump to line 18\n           line = 18\n       elif line == 18:\n           print(\"On line 18\")\n           break\n       line += 1\n   ```\n\n3. **Using Exception Handling:**\n   Although not recommended for this purpose, you can use exceptions to jump to a specific part of the code.\n\n   ```python\n   class GoToLine18(Exception):\n       pass\n\n   try:\n       # Code on line 5\n       print(\"On line 5\")\n       # Jump to line 18\n       raise GoToLine18\n   except GoToLine18:\n       # Code that starts on line 18\n       print(\"Jumped to line 18!\")\n   ```\n\nWhile these methods can simulate a `GOTO` statement, it's generally better to design your program's flow using structured programming principles. This makes the code more readable and maintainable."
