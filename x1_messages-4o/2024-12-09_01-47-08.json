The same code worked fine with Vista, but I'm having issues with Windows 7. The error I'm getting is: \"socket.error: [Errno 10013] An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions\". How can I get this code to work on Windows 7? \n\nHere's my sample code:\n\n```\nimport SocketServer\nimport struct\n\nclass MyTCPHandler(SocketServer.BaseRequestHandler):\n    def handle(self):\n        headerText = \"\"\"HTTP/1.0 200 OK\n                        Date: Fri, 31 Dec 1999 23:59:59 GMT\n                        Content-Type: text/html\n                        Content-Length: 1354\"\"\"\n        bodyText = \"<html><body>some page</body></html>\"\n        self.request.send(headerText + \"\\n\" + bodyText)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    HOST, PORT = \"localhost\", 80\n    server = SocketServer.TCPServer((HOST, PORT), MyTCPHandler)\n    server.serve_forever()\n```\n\nAnd here's the error traceback when I run this code:\n\n```\nC:\\python>python TestServer.py\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"TestServer.py\", line 19, in\n      server = SocketServer.TCPServer((HOST, PORT), MyTCPHandler)   \n  File \"C:\\Python26\\lib\\SocketServer.py\", line 400, in __init__\n      self.server_bind()   \n  File \"C:\\Python26\\lib\\SocketServer.py\", line 411, in server_bind\n      self.socket.bind(self.server_address) \n  File \"\", line 1, in bind\nsocket.error: [Errno 10013] An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, `[Errno 10013]`, typically indicates that your program doesn't have permission to bind to the specified port, which is often the case with ports below 1024 on Windows systems. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Run as Administrator:**\n   - On Windows, you need administrative privileges to bind to ports below 1024. Try running your Python script with administrator rights. You can do this by right-clicking the Command Prompt shortcut and selecting \"Run as administrator\", then executing your script.\n\n2. **Use a Different Port:**\n   - If running as an administrator is not an option, or if you prefer not to, you can change the port number to a value above 1024 (e.g., 8080) to avoid the need for administrative rights.\n\n   ```python\n   HOST, PORT = \"localhost\", 8080\n   ```\n\n   Remember to update any client code or browser settings to point to this new port.\n\n3. **Check for Conflicting Applications:**\n   - Ensure there are no other applications or services currently using port 80. Common services like IIS or other web servers might already be bound to this port.\n\n4. **Firewall and Antivirus Settings:**\n   - Check your firewall and antivirus settings to ensure they aren't blocking your application from binding to a network port.\n\n5. **Consider Using a Different Python Version or Environment:**\n   - Python 2.6.5 is quite old and might have compatibility issues with newer Windows versions. Consider using a more recent version of Python in a virtual environment if possible.\n\nIf you follow these steps, you should be able to resolve the permissions error and get your TCP server running on Windows 7. Let me know if you need further assistance!"
