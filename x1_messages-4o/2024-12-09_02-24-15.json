I have two files, page1.html and page2.html, which extend base1.html and base2.html respectively, and include commondata.html. The commondata.html overrides a block that is specified in both base1.html and base2.html. However, I am unable to use both extends and include simultaneously. Is there a workaround to this issue? My ultimate goal is to provide the same page in both PDF and HTML format, where the formatting is slightly different.\n\npage1.html:\n```\n{% extends \"base1.html\" %}\n{% include \"commondata.html\" %}\n```\npage2.html:\n```\n{% extends \"base2.html\" %} \n{% include \"commondata.html\" %}\n```"

        "content": "In Django templates, you can indeed use both `{% extends %}` and `{% include %}` in the same file, but you need to make sure you are using them correctly. The `{% extends %}` tag should be the first tag in the template, while `{% include %}` can be used inside blocks defined in the base templates. Here's how you can structure your files:\n\n1. **base1.html** and **base2.html** should define blocks that can be overridden in the child templates:\n\n   ```html\n   <!-- base1.html -->\n   <!DOCTYPE html>\n   <html lang=\"en\">\n   <head>\n       <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n       <title>Base 1</title>\n   </head>\n   <body>\n       <header>\n           <!-- Header content -->\n       </header>\n       <div>\n           {% block content %}\n           <!-- Default content for base1 -->\n           {% endblock %}\n       </div>\n       <footer>\n           <!-- Footer content -->\n       </footer>\n   </body>\n   </html>\n   ```\n\n   ```html\n   <!-- base2.html -->\n   <!DOCTYPE html>\n   <html lang=\"en\">\n   <head>\n       <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n       <title>Base 2</title>\n   </head>\n   <body>\n       <header>\n           <!-- Header content -->\n       </header>\n       <div>\n           {% block content %}\n           <!-- Default content for base2 -->\n           {% endblock %}\n       </div>\n       <footer>\n           <!-- Footer content -->\n       </footer>\n   </body>\n   </html>\n   ```\n\n2. **commondata.html** should contain the content meant to be shared between page1.html and page2.html. It will be included inside a block:\n\n   ```html\n   <!-- commondata.html -->\n   <div>\n       <h1>Common Data</h1>\n       <p>This is the common data that will appear in both page1 and page2.</p>\n   </div>\n   ```\n\n3. **page1.html** and **page2.html** will extend their respective base templates and include the common data within the content block:\n\n   ```html\n   <!-- page1.html -->\n   {% extends \"base1.html\" %}\n\n   {% block content %}\n   {% include \"commondata.html\" %}\n   {% endblock %}\n   ```\n\n   ```html\n   <!-- page2.html -->\n   {% extends \"base2.html\" %}\n\n   {% block content %}\n   {% include \"commondata.html\" %}\n   {% endblock %}\n   ```\n\nBy following this structure, you ensure that both `page1.html` and `page2.html` will correctly extend their respective base templates and include `commondata.html` within the specified content block. This allows you to maintain a clear separation between the layout and content, and reuse `commondata.html` without any issues."
