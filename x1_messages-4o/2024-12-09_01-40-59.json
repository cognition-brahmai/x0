My current code is as follows:\n\n```python\nwindowSurface = pygame.display.set_mode((1000, 750), pygame.DOUBLEBUF)\npygame.draw.rect(windowSurface, pygame.Color(255, 255, 255, 128), pygame.Rect(0, 0, 1000, 750))\n```\n\nI want the white rectangle to be 50% transparent, but the alpha value doesn't seem to be working. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To achieve transparency in Pygame, you need to use a surface with per-pixel alpha. The main display surface doesn't support alpha transparency directly. Instead, you can draw the rectangle onto a separate surface that supports alpha transparency, and then blit that surface onto the main display surface. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pygame\nimport sys\n\n# Initialize Pygame\npygame.init()\n\n# Set up the display\nwindowSurface = pygame.display.set_mode((1000, 750), pygame.DOUBLEBUF)\n\n# Create a surface with per-pixel alpha\nalpha_surface = pygame.Surface((1000, 750), pygame.SRCALPHA)\n\n# Fill the alpha surface with a color that includes an alpha value\nalpha_surface.fill((255, 255, 255, 128))  # White with 50% transparency\n\n# Main game loop\nrunning = True\nwhile running:\n    for event in pygame.event.get():\n        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n            running = False\n\n    # Draw the alpha surface onto the main window surface\n    windowSurface.blit(alpha_surface, (0, 0))\n\n    # Update the display\n    pygame.display.flip()\n\n# Quit Pygame\npygame.quit()\nsys.exit()\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, `pygame.SRCALPHA` is used to create a surface (`alpha_surface`) that supports per-pixel alpha blending. Then, you fill this surface with the desired color and alpha, and blit it onto the main display surface (`windowSurface`). This way, you achieve the desired transparency effect."
