Can you explain using adequate examples?"

        "content": "Certainly! Let's delve into the differences between `inspect.getmembers()`, `type().__dict__.items()`, and `dir()` in Python, using the integer `1` as an example, but applicable to any object type.\n\n### 1. `inspect.getmembers()`\n\nThe `inspect.getmembers(object, predicate=None)` function is part of the `inspect` module. It returns all the members of an object, including its methods and attributes. This includes both instance and class attributes, and it lists them as `(name, value)` pairs.\n\nExample:\n```python\nimport inspect\n\nmembers = inspect.getmembers(1)\nprint(members)\n```\n\nFor an integer, you'll see a list of tuples containing the names and values of its methods and attributes. It explores the object's class and its hierarchy, so it provides a comprehensive list.\n\n### 2. `type().__dict__.items()`\n\nThe `type(obj).__dict__.items()` expression accesses the dictionary of the class of the object. This dictionary contains the class attributes and methods, but not the instance-specific attributes.\n\nExample:\n```python\nclass_dict_items = type(1).__dict__.items()\nprint(list(class_dict_items))\n```\n\nFor an integer, this will show you the methods defined in the `int` class, but not those inherited from its parent classes or any instance-specific information.\n\n### 3. `dir()`\n\nThe `dir(object)` function is a built-in Python function that attempts to return a list of valid attributes for that object. It provides a more general view, showing all the attributes and methods that are accessible, including inherited ones.\n\nExample:\n```python\ndir_output = dir(1)\nprint(dir_output)\n```\n\nFor an integer, this will include methods and attributes from the `int` class and any inherited ones from `object`.\n\n### Summary of Differences\n\n- **`inspect.getmembers()`**: Shows a complete list of all members, including attributes and methods, for the object, considering the entire class hierarchy. It gives detailed information with values.\n  \n- **`type().__dict__.items()`**: Provides only the members defined directly in the class of the object. It doesn't include inherited methods or instance-specific attributes.\n\n- **`dir()`**: Offers a list of all accessible attributes and methods, including inherited ones, but without values. It's useful for a quick overview of what an object can do.\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **`obj.__class__.__name__`**: Simply retrieves the name of the class to which the object belongs. It is straightforward and does not provide any attributes or method details.\n  \n- **`obj.__dict__`**: Shows the instance attributes stored in the object. For an integer, which is immutable and doesn't have instance attributes, this will be empty or cause an AttributeError.\n\nThese tools are very helpful for introspection in Python, allowing you to explore the capabilities and structure of objects at runtime."
