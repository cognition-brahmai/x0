        "content": "To sort an array of objects by their \"name\" property in JavaScript, you can use the `Array.prototype.sort()` method. This method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. You can provide a compare function as an argument to define the sort order.\n\nHere's a step-by-step example:\n\n1. Define your array of objects. Each object should have a \"name\" property that you want to sort by.\n\n2. Use the `sort()` method with a compare function that compares the \"name\" properties of two objects.\n\nHere is a sample code:\n\n```javascript\n// Define an array of objects\nconst people = [\n  { name: 'John', age: 25 },\n  { name: 'Alice', age: 30 },\n  { name: 'Bob', age: 20 }\n];\n\n// Sort the array by the \"name\" property\npeople.sort((a, b) => {\n  // Compare the \"name\" properties of two objects\n  if (a.name < b.name) {\n    return -1; // a comes before b\n  }\n  if (a.name > b.name) {\n    return 1; // a comes after b\n  }\n  return 0; // names are equal\n});\n\n// Output the sorted array\nconsole.log(people);\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The `sort()` method takes a compare function that receives two arguments: `a` and `b`. These are the elements from the array that are being compared.\n\n- The compare function should return:\n  - A negative value if `a` should come before `b`.\n  - A positive value if `a` should come after `b`.\n  - Zero if `a` and `b` are considered equal in terms of sorting order.\n\n- In this example, the `name` properties are compared using the `<` and `>` operators, which work lexicographically for strings.\n\nThis will sort the `people` array by the \"name\" property in ascending order. If you want to sort it in descending order, you can simply swap the return values in the conditions:\n\n```javascript\nif (a.name < b.name) {\n  return 1; // a comes after b\n}\nif (a.name > b.name) {\n  return -1; // a comes before b\n}\n```\n\nThis approach can be adjusted to sort by other properties or to handle case-insensitive sorting by converting the names to lowercase using `a.name.toLowerCase()` and `b.name.toLowerCase()` before comparison."
