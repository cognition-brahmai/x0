Moreover, I found out that all the files in `/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/` are owned by `root:wheel`.

        "content": "The error you are encountering is due to the fact that macOS protects certain system directories, and Python 2.7 is included with the system. This protection means you cannot modify the files in `/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/` directly, even with `sudo`. This is part of macOS's System Integrity Protection (SIP) feature.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Use a Virtual Environment**:\n   - It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage Python packages, especially on systems where the default Python installation is protected.\n   - Install `virtualenv` if it's not already installed:\n\n     ```bash\n     sudo -H pip install virtualenv\n     ```\n\n   - Create a new virtual environment:\n\n     ```bash\n     virtualenv ~/myenv\n     ```\n\n   - Activate the virtual environment:\n\n     ```bash\n     source ~/myenv/bin/activate\n     ```\n\n   - Now, try upgrading `setuptools` and installing `ansible` within this virtual environment:\n\n     ```bash\n     pip install --upgrade setuptools\n     pip install ansible\n     ```\n\n2. **Use Python 3**:\n   - Python 2.7 is no longer maintained, and it is advisable to switch to Python 3.\n   - You can install Python 3 using Homebrew:\n\n     ```bash\n     brew install python\n     ```\n\n   - This will install `python3`, `pip3`, and will not interfere with the system Python.\n   - Use `pip3` to manage your packages:\n\n     ```bash\n     pip3 install --upgrade setuptools\n     pip3 install ansible\n     ```\n\n3. **Disable SIP (Not Recommended)**:\n   - Disabling SIP is not recommended as it can expose your system to security risks. However, if you decide to do so, you can follow these steps (make sure you understand the risks involved):\n   - Restart your Mac and hold down Command + R to boot into Recovery Mode.\n   - Once in Recovery Mode, open Terminal from the Utilities menu.\n   - Run the following command:\n\n     ```bash\n     csrutil disable\n     ```\n\n   - Restart your Mac, and SIP will be disabled. You should be able to modify system files, but remember to re-enable SIP after you are done by booting into Recovery Mode again and running `csrutil enable`.\n\n4. **Use `--user` Flag**:\n   - If you are not using a virtual environment and want to install Python packages just for your user, you can use the `--user` flag with pip:\n\n     ```bash\n     pip install --user --upgrade setuptools\n     pip install --user ansible\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to upgrade `setuptools` and install `ansible` without encountering permission issues. Using a virtual environment or transitioning to Python 3 are the preferred methods."
