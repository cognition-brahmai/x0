        "content": "To create a `tzinfo` instance using an offset from UTC in seconds, you can use the `datetime.timezone` class, which is part of the Python standard library. This class allows you to create a timezone with a fixed offset from UTC. Since you're working with an offset of `19800` seconds or `+0530`, you can use the following approach:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\n\n# Offset in seconds\noffset_seconds = 19800\n\n# Create a timezone instance with the specific offset\ntz = timezone(timedelta(seconds=offset_seconds))\n\n# Example usage with the current time\ncurrent_time = datetime.now(tz)\n\nprint(\"Current time with offset:\", current_time)\n```\n\nThis code snippet creates a `timezone` instance with a `timedelta` representing the offset, and then uses it to get the current time in that timezone.\n\nIf you need to handle the string format `+0530`, you can parse it and convert it to a `timedelta` as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport re\n\n# Offset in string format\noffset_str = \"+0530\"\n\n# Parse the string to get hours and minutes\nmatch = re.match(r\"([+-])(\\d{2})(\\d{2})\", offset_str)\nif match:\n    sign, hours, minutes = match.groups()\n    hours, minutes = int(hours), int(minutes)\n    offset_seconds = (hours * 3600 + minutes * 60) * (1 if sign == '+' else -1)\n\n    # Create a timezone instance\n    tz = timezone(timedelta(seconds=offset_seconds))\n\n    # Example usage with the current time\n    current_time = datetime.now(tz)\n\n    print(\"Current time with offset:\", current_time)\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that you can convert both the numeric and string representations of the offset into a `tzinfo` instance that can be used with `datetime` objects."
