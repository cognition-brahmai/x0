What would be the best way to compare these two arrays?"

        "content": "Comparing two arrays that contain `NaN` values requires a special approach because `NaN` is not equal to `NaN` in standard comparisons. To handle this, you can use the `numpy` function `np.array_equal` with the `equal_nan=True` parameter, or you can manually handle the comparison by using `np.isnan` to check for `NaN` values. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Using `np.array_equal` with `equal_nan=True` (NumPy 1.19.0 and later):\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([1, 2, np.NaN])\nb = np.array([1, 2, np.NaN])\n\nif np.array_equal(a, b, equal_nan=True):\n    print('arrays are equal')\nelse:\n    print('arrays are not equal')\n```\n\n### Manual Comparison:\nIf you're using an older version of NumPy that doesn't support `equal_nan=True`, you can do a comparison like this:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([1, 2, np.NaN])\nb = np.array([1, 2, np.NaN])\n\ndef arrays_equal_with_nan(arr1, arr2):\n    # Check if shapes are the same\n    if arr1.shape != arr2.shape:\n        return False\n    # Check if all elements are equal, considering NaNs\n    return np.all((arr1 == arr2) | (np.isnan(arr1) & np.isnan(arr2)))\n\nif arrays_equal_with_nan(a, b):\n    print('arrays are equal')\nelse:\n    print('arrays are not equal')\n```\n\nBoth methods will correctly identify that `a` and `b` are equal, despite containing `NaN` values."
