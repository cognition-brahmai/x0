Currently, I'm doing it like this:\n\n```python\nax.set_yscale('log')\nax.set_xlim([0,10])\nax.set_xlabel('some label')\n```\n\nThis method, however, becomes tiring after some time. I found another method that is much more concise:\n\n```python\nax.set(yscale='log', xlim=[0,10], xlabel='some label')\n```\n\nThe documentation only states \"A tkstyle set command, pass kwargs to set properties\". What is the idiomatic or preferred way to set matplotlib figure/axes properties? Is the `set` method's API stable?"

        "content": "The `set` method in Matplotlib provides a convenient and concise way to set multiple properties of an Axes object at once. This method is indeed stable and part of the public API, so you can rely on it for setting various properties without concern for future changes that might break your code.\n\nUsing the `set` method is often considered more idiomatic in cases where you want to configure several properties at once, as it reduces the verbosity of your code and improves readability. The method accepts keyword arguments where the keys are the property names and the values are the desired settings, making it both flexible and easy to use.\n\nHere's a quick comparison of when you might prefer each approach:\n\n- **Using individual setter methods (`ax.set_yscale`, `ax.set_xlim`, etc.):** Useful when you are setting a single property or when you want to emphasize the setting of specific attributes. It can be more explicit, which may be beneficial for readability in some contexts.\n\n- **Using `ax.set`:** Preferred when you need to set multiple properties at once. It keeps the code concise and organized, especially when initializing or updating an Axes object with several configurations.\n\nIn summary, using the `set` method is a good practice when dealing with multiple properties, and you can expect it to be a stable and reliable part of Matplotlib's API."
