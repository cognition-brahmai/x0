        "content": "To transform the sequence 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 into the sequence 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, we need to find a mathematical operation that can be applied to each number in the original sequence to achieve the corresponding number in the target sequence.\n\nLet's look at each number in the original sequence and the corresponding number in the target sequence:\n\n1. Transform 16 to 5:\n   - Divide 16 by 3.2: \\(16 / 3.2 = 5\\)\n\n2. Transform 8 to 10:\n   - Divide 8 by 0.8: \\(8 / 0.8 = 10\\)\n\n3. Transform 4 to 15:\n   - Multiply 4 by 3.75: \\(4 * 3.75 = 15\\)\n\n4. Transform 2 to 20:\n   - Multiply 2 by 10: \\(2 * 10 = 20\\)\n\n5. Transform 1 to 25:\n   - Multiply 1 by 25: \\(1 * 25 = 25\\)\n\nTherefore, the sequence of operations to transform the original sequence into the target sequence is:\n\n1. Divide 16 by 3.2 to get 5.\n2. Divide 8 by 0.8 to get 10.\n3. Multiply 4 by 3.75 to get 15.\n4. Multiply 2 by 10 to get 20.\n5. Multiply 1 by 25 to get 25.\n\nBy following these steps, you can achieve the desired transformation of the sequence."
