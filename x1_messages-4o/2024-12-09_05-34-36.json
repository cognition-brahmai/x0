Is my current implementation using this function correct and which definition of the variable 'giga' should I use?

        "content": "Your implementation using `os.statvfs('/')` is mostly correct for obtaining the hard drive size and free space on macOS using Python 2.7. However, there are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Block Size**: You should verify whether `f_frsize` or `f_bsize` is more appropriate for your needs. Typically, `f_frsize` is used for fragment size, which is often the correct choice, but you can double-check with your specific file system documentation.\n\n2. **Giga Definition**: The choice between `1024 * 1024 * 1024` and `1000 * 1000 * 1000` depends on whether you want to use binary (GiB) or decimal (GB) units:\n   - `1024 * 1024 * 1024` is the binary definition (GiB).\n   - `1000 * 1000 * 1000` is the decimal definition (GB).\n\n3. **Python 3 Alternative**: Since `os.statvfs` is deprecated in Python 3, you can use the `shutil` module, which provides a higher-level interface:\n\n   ```python\n   import shutil\n\n   def get_machine_storage():\n       total_size, used_size, free_size = shutil.disk_usage('/')\n       # Use appropriate conversion based on your needs\n       giga = 1024 * 1024 * 1024  # For GiB\n       # giga = 1000 * 1000 * 1000  # For GB\n       total_size_gb = total_size / giga\n       free_size_gb = free_size / giga\n       print('total_size = %s' % total_size_gb)\n       print('free_size = %s' % free_size_gb)\n\n   get_machine_storage()\n   ```\n\nThis code will work in Python 3 and provides the same functionality using the `shutil.disk_usage` function, which is more straightforward and Pythonic for disk space queries."
