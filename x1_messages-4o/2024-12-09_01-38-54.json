        "content": "To determine which version of PyMongo is currently being used in your project, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Installed Packages**: First, you can check the versions of the installed packages using pip. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip freeze | grep -i pymongo\n   ```\n\n   This will list all the packages related to PyMongo and their versions installed in your environment.\n\n2. **Check Within Your Python Code**: If you want to check the version directly within your Python code, you can do so by importing `pymongo` and printing its version. Add the following lines to your script:\n\n   ```python\n   import pymongo\n   print(pymongo.__version__)\n   ```\n\n   This will print the version of PyMongo that is currently being used by your Python environment.\n\n3. **Virtual Environment**: If you are using a virtual environment, ensure that you activate it before running the above commands. This ensures that you are checking the versions of packages that are specific to your project's environment.\n\n4. **Dependency Resolution**: In some cases, you might have dependencies that require different versions of PyMongo. In such scenarios, the version that gets installed is usually the one that satisfies all the dependencies, which might result in a different version than the one explicitly mentioned in your `requirements.txt`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to determine the active version of PyMongo in your project."
