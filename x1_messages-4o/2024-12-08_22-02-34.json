Please provide an example of the SQL code required to create a table with columns for the name, texture, color, aroma, symbolic meaning, availability, and pricing of each flower, as well as a table that tracks the location of each vendor and their corresponding shipping rates."

        "content": "To create an all-encompassing floral inventory that takes into account the preferences and desires of the bride and groom, while incorporating a new constraint that each flower must have a specific meaning or symbolism, you can design a SQL database with the following tables: `Flowers` and `Vendors`. Below are examples of the SQL code required to create these tables:\n\n### SQL Code to Create the `Flowers` Table\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE Flowers (\n    FlowerID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n    Texture VARCHAR(50),\n    Color VARCHAR(30),\n    Aroma VARCHAR(50),\n    SymbolicMeaning VARCHAR(255),\n    Availability VARCHAR(30),\n    Pricing DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL\n);\n```\n\n### SQL Code to Create the `Vendors` Table\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE Vendors (\n    VendorID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    VendorName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n    Location VARCHAR(100),\n    ShippingRate DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL\n);\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Flowers Table**:\n  - `FlowerID`: A unique identifier for each flower.\n  - `Name`: The name of the flower.\n  - `Texture`: The texture description of the flower (e.g., soft, velvety).\n  - `Color`: The color of the flower.\n  - `Aroma`: The aroma description of the flower (e.g., sweet, citrusy).\n  - `SymbolicMeaning`: The symbolic meaning associated with the flower (e.g., love, purity).\n  - `Availability`: Indicates when the flower is available (e.g., seasonal, year-round).\n  - `Pricing`: The price of the flower.\n\n- **Vendors Table**:\n  - `VendorID`: A unique identifier for each vendor.\n  - `VendorName`: The name of the vendor.\n  - `Location`: The location of the vendor.\n  - `ShippingRate`: The rate for shipping flowers from the vendor's location.\n\nThese tables allow you to maintain a comprehensive inventory of flowers, considering their symbolic meanings, and also track the vendors and their shipping rates for logistical considerations. You can further enhance this schema by adding relationships between tables, such as tracking which flowers are available with which vendors, using a junction table if needed."
