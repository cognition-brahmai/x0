The other part, \"Although the sun shone brightly,\" is a dependent clause because it cannot stand alone as a complete sentence.\n\nHere is how you can highlight the independent clause in a LaTeX document:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{xcolor}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{center}\nAlthough the sun shone brightly, \\textcolor{red}{the wind blew coldly}.\n\\end{center}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nIn this LaTeX code, the independent clause \"the wind blew coldly\" is highlighted in red using the `xcolor` package. You can change the color as needed."
