I am currently using the following code:\n\n```python\nrows = data.index\nrow_count = len(rows)\nrandom.shuffle(list(rows))\n\ndata.reindex(rows)\n\ntraining_data = data[row_count // 10:]\ntesting_data = data[:row_count // 10]\n```\n\nHowever, when I try to use one of these resulting DataFrame objects inside of a SVM classifier, I encounter an IndexError: \"each subindex must be either a slice, an integer, Ellipsis, or newaxis\". Could there be a better approach to achieve this?"

        "content": "It looks like there might be an issue with the way you're handling the DataFrame indexing and shuffling. The `random.shuffle()` function is not in-place for the indices, and you should ensure that you are properly re-indexing the DataFrame. Here's a more reliable approach using Pandas functions to achieve the desired split:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Example of reading a CSV file\n# data = pd.read_csv('your_file.csv')\n\n# Shuffle the DataFrame\ndata = data.sample(frac=1, random_state=42).reset_index(drop=True)\n\n# Calculate the split index\nsplit_index = int(len(data) * 0.1)\n\n# Split the data into testing (10%) and training (90%)\ntesting_data = data.iloc[:split_index]\ntraining_data = data.iloc[split_index:]\n\n# Now you can use these DataFrames with your SVM classifier\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what this code does:\n\n1. **Shuffling Data:** The `data.sample(frac=1, random_state=42)` shuffles the entire DataFrame. The `frac=1` parameter means you're sampling 100% of the data, effectively shuffling it. The `random_state` ensures that the shuffle is reproducible.\n\n2. **Resetting Index:** `reset_index(drop=True)` is used to reset the indices of the shuffled DataFrame, which can prevent potential indexing errors later on.\n\n3. **Splitting the Data:** The code calculates the split index as 10% of the total length of the DataFrame. It then uses `iloc` to slice the DataFrame into `testing_data` and `training_data`.\n\nThis approach should help you avoid any indexing issues when using these DataFrames with your SVM classifier."
