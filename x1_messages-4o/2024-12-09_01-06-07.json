When I run `unittest.main()`, I get the expected output of the unittest framework along with 'bar' which is the print statement from the method `bar`. My question is, is there a way to suppress the output from the method `bar` while still getting the output of the unittest framework? I want to hide the normal stdout of the python script while running its unittests, but I still want the unittest stdout to be displayed. I don't want to disable the stdout of my tested script."

        "content": "To suppress the output from the method `bar` while running your unit tests, you can temporarily redirect `stdout` during the execution of the method. This way, the print statements inside the method will not be displayed, but you'll still get the output from the unittest framework. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\nYou can use the `unittest` framework's `mock` module (available in Python 2.7 as `unittest.mock` and can be installed via `mock` package for Python 2.6) to patch `sys.stdout` during the test. Here is an example of how you can do it:\n\n1. Install the `mock` library if you haven't already, since Python 2.6 does not have it built-in:\n\n   ```\n   pip install mock\n   ```\n\n2. Modify your unit test to suppress the stdout during the execution of the method `bar`:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\nfrom mock import patch\nimport sys\nfrom io import StringIO\n\nclass Foo:\n    def bar(self):\n        print('bar')\n        return 7\n\nclass TestFoo(unittest.TestCase):\n    def test_bar(self):\n        foo = Foo()\n        with patch('sys.stdout', new=StringIO()):\n            result = foo.bar()\n        self.assertEqual(result, 7)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\nIn this code, the `patch` function is used to temporarily replace `sys.stdout` with a `StringIO` object, which effectively suppresses any output to the console during the execution of `foo.bar()`. The `unittest` output will still be displayed as expected.\n\nNote that `StringIO` is a part of `io` module in Python 2.6, so you need to import it from there. In the context of Python 2, using `StringIO` may require you to adapt based on actual use cases, such as using `cStringIO` for performance considerations, though `StringIO` suffices for this purpose."
