I have tried using the `%r` formatting flag which seems to return a raw string, but it's within single quote marks. My code is as follows:\n\n```python\nline1 = \"hurr..\\n..durr\"\nline2 = r\"hurr..\\n..durr\"\n\nprint(line1 == line2)  # outputs False\nprint((\"%r\"%line1)[1:-1] == line2)  # outputs True\n```\n\nIs there a simpler or more straightforward way to achieve this?"

        "content": "In Python, a raw string is simply a string where backslashes are not treated as escape characters. However, once a string is created, you can't change its \"raw\" nature. Instead, you can create a new string that has the same content as if it were a raw string.\n\nIf you want to convert a string into a format that matches a raw string's behavior (i.e., where escape sequences are not processed), you can manually replace backslashes with double backslashes. Here's a more straightforward approach to achieve the desired behavior:\n\n```python\n# Original string with escape sequences\nline1 = \"hurr..\\n..durr\"\n\n# Convert to a raw-like string by replacing backslashes\nline2 = line1.replace(\"\\\\\", \"\\\\\\\\\")\n\nprint(line2)  # Outputs: hurr..\\n..durr\n```\n\nThis method doesn't use the `%r` formatting and avoids the issue with the single quotes. It directly transforms the string to mimic the behavior of a raw string by escaping the backslashes. The result, `line2`, will visually appear the same as `r\"hurr..\\n..durr\"` when printed, and it will compare as equal to a similar raw string."
