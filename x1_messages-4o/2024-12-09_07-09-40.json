        "content": "Absolutely! Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a versatile code editor that can be configured to run Python code. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you set it up:\n\n1. **Install Python**: Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/). During installation, ensure that you check the option to add Python to your system's PATH.\n\n2. **Install the Python Extension**: \n   - Open VS Code.\n   - Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.\n   - Search for \"Python\" and install the extension provided by Microsoft. This extension provides rich support for Python, including IntelliSense, linting, and debugging.\n\n3. **Configure the Python Interpreter**:\n   - Open a Python file in VS Code or create a new one with the `.py` extension.\n   - Once the Python extension is installed, you should see a notification pop up asking you to select a Python interpreter. Click on it and select the interpreter you want to use (usually the one from your Python installation).\n   - Alternatively, you can select the interpreter by opening the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), typing \"Python: Select Interpreter\", and choosing the appropriate interpreter.\n\n4. **Run Python Code**:\n   - You can run your Python script directly in the terminal by opening the integrated terminal (`View > Terminal`) and typing `python your_script.py`.\n   - Alternatively, after installing the Python extension, you should see a \"Run\" button appear in the top-right corner of your editor when you open a Python file. Clicking this will execute the code.\n\n5. **Debug Python Code**:\n   - To debug your code, set breakpoints by clicking in the gutter to the left of the line numbers.\n   - Open the Debug view by clicking on the Debug icon in the Activity Bar.\n   - Click the green play button or press `F5` to start debugging.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to write, run, and debug Python code directly within Visual Studio Code. Enjoy coding with your new setup!"
