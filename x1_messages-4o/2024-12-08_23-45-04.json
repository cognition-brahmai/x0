        "content": "One interesting fact about Nikola Tesla is that he once developed a concept for a global wireless communication system called the \"World Wireless System.\" Tesla envisioned transmitting messages, images, and even electricity wirelessly across the globe through a network of strategically placed towers. His vision was ahead of its time and laid the groundwork for many of the wireless technologies we rely on today, even though his project was never fully realized during his lifetime."
