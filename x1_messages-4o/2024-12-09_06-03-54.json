However, I want to convert a matrix of feature names into TF-IDF features, instead of raw documents. The corpus I want to provide to the `fit_transform()` function is an array of arrays of features per document, as opposed to a one dimensional array of strings. My features are of varying lengths and occasionally overlap, so I can't just concatenate my features into single strings and use ngrams. Is there a different Scikit-Learn function I can use for this that I'm not finding? Is there a way to use the TfidfVectorizer that I'm not seeing? Or will I have to homebrew my own TF-IDF function to do this? For example, my corpus is like this:\n\n```python\ncorpus = [\n    ['orange', 'red', 'blue'],\n    ['orange', 'yellow', 'red'],\n    ['orange', 'green', 'purple (if you believe in purple)'],\n    ['orange', 'reddish orange', 'black and blue']\n]\n```"

        "content": "To handle a corpus where each document is represented as a list of features, you won't be able to directly use `TfidfVectorizer` from Scikit-Learn because it expects each document to be a single string. However, you can achieve your goal by using the `TfidfVectorizer` in a slightly different way. You can concatenate the features of each document into a single string and then feed it into the `TfidfVectorizer`. This will allow you to compute the TF-IDF scores for each feature. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Concatenate Features:** Join the features of each document into a single string with a delimiter (e.g., space or comma).\n\n2. **Use TfidfVectorizer:** Fit the `TfidfVectorizer` on the concatenated strings.\n\nHere's a code example to illustrate this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n\n# Your corpus of features\ncorpus = [\n    ['orange', 'red', 'blue'],\n    ['orange', 'yellow', 'red'],\n    ['orange', 'green', 'purple (if you believe in purple)'],\n    ['orange', 'reddish orange', 'black and blue']\n]\n\n# Concatenate each list of features into a single string\nconcatenated_corpus = [' '.join(features) for features in corpus]\n\n# Initialize the TfidfVectorizer\nvectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\n\n# Fit and transform the concatenated corpus\ntfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(concatenated_corpus)\n\n# Convert the TF-IDF matrix to a dense format and print it\ntfidf_dense = tfidf_matrix.todense()\n\n# Get feature names to map indices to actual feature names\nfeature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()\n\n# Print the TF-IDF matrix\nprint(\"TF-IDF Matrix:\")\nprint(tfidf_dense)\n\n# Print feature names\nprint(\"\\nFeature Names:\")\nprint(feature_names)\n```\n\n### Notes:\n\n- **Delimiter Choice:** The choice of delimiter when concatenating the features can be important if some features contain spaces. Using a unique delimiter that doesn't appear in your features can help prevent unintended merging.\n\n- **Overlapping Features:** If you have overlapping features that need to be treated as distinct, this approach may require careful handling of delimiters or preprocessing to ensure features are correctly tokenized.\n\n- **Custom Tokenization:** If your features have specific tokenization needs, you might consider writing a custom tokenizer function and passing it to `TfidfVectorizer` via the `tokenizer` parameter.\n\nUsing this method, you can leverage `TfidfVectorizer` to compute TF-IDF scores for your feature-based documents."
