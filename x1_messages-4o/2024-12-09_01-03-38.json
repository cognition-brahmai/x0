        "content": "Yes, you can reset the IPython kernel without closing it by using a combination of commands, as `%reset` only clears the variables and not the imports or other state. Here\u2019s a more thorough way to mimic a kernel restart without actually closing it:\n\n1. **Use `%reset -f`:** This command will clear all variables in the interactive namespace. The `-f` flag forces the reset without asking for confirmation.\n\n2. **Reload your modules:** You can reload your modules using the `importlib.reload()` function from Python's `importlib` library. This can help in re-importing modules that are already loaded.\n\n3. **Clear the IPython History and Cache:**\n   - Use `%xdel` to delete specific variables and objects.\n   - Use `%clear` to clear the terminal screen (this won\u2019t affect the kernel state but is useful for a clean workspace).\n\n4. **Manually Reload Everything:**\n   - Loop through `sys.modules` and reload the modules you need. \n   - Be cautious with this approach as it might lead to undesirable side effects if certain modules do not support reloading properly.\n\nHere\u2019s a small code snippet to clear variables and reload a module:\n\n```python\n# Clear all variables\n%reset -f\n\n# Import importlib\nimport importlib\n\n# Reload a specific module\nimport some_module\nimportlib.reload(some_module)\n```\n\nFor a more comprehensive reset, especially when dealing with many modules, consider writing a custom function to loop through and reload them as needed.\n\nThis approach won\u2019t completely mimic a kernel restart (like clearing all memory and state), but it can help in refreshing your working environment significantly without closing the session."
