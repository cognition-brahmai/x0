However, when I try to add multiple strings using the `update()` function, it treats them as separate character items. Here is the code I used and the output:\n\n```python\n>>> set1 = {'a', 'bc'}\n>>> set1.add('de')\n>>> set1\nset(['a', 'de', 'bc'])\n>>> set1.update('fg', 'hi')\n>>> set1\nset(['a', 'g', 'f', 'i', 'h', 'de', 'bc'])\n```\n\nThe desired output is `set(['a', 'de', 'bc', 'fg', 'hi'])`. Does this mean that the `update()` function does not work for adding strings? I'm using Python 2.7.1."

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is due to how the `update()` method works with strings in Python. When you pass a string to `update()`, it treats the string as an iterable of characters, which is why you're seeing each character added individually to the set. This is expected behavior in both Python 2 and Python 3.\n\nTo achieve your desired result, where you want to add multiple complete strings to the set, you should pass them as a collection, such as a list or a tuple. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\n>>> set1 = {'a', 'bc'}\n>>> set1.add('de')\n>>> set1\nset(['a', 'de', 'bc'])\n>>> set1.update(['fg', 'hi'])  # Pass strings as a list\n>>> set1\nset(['a', 'de', 'bc', 'fg', 'hi'])\n```\n\nBy passing a list `['fg', 'hi']` to the `update()` method, each element of the list is added to the set as a whole string, rather than iterating over each character. This will give you the desired output."
