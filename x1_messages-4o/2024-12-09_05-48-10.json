For example, in the following code snippet:\n\n<pre><code>\nif foo > 5 or bar > 6:\n    print 'foobar'\n</code></pre>\n\nWill the condition 'foo > 5' be evaluated first and then 'bar > 6' (i.e., left to right), or will it be evaluated in the opposite order (right to left)? Can I assume that the logical operators 'or' and 'and' are evaluated in the same order?"

        "content": "In Python, conditions in an `if` statement are evaluated from left to right. This means that in your code snippet:\n\n```python\nif foo > 5 or bar > 6:\n    print 'foobar'\n```\n\nthe condition `foo > 5` is evaluated first. If `foo > 5` evaluates to `True`, then `bar > 6` will not be evaluated because the logical `or` operator only requires one of its operands to be `True` for the entire expression to be `True`. This is known as \"short-circuit\" evaluation.\n\nSimilarly, with the logical `and` operator, evaluation is short-circuited. If the first condition is `False`, the rest of the conditions won't be evaluated because the entire expression cannot be `True` if any single condition is `False`.\n\nHere's a brief summary of how the evaluation works:\n\n- For `or`: Evaluate from left to right, and stop as soon as a `True` condition is encountered.\n- For `and`: Evaluate from left to right, and stop as soon as a `False` condition is encountered.\n\nSo, it's safe to assume that both `or` and `and` follow left-to-right evaluation with short-circuit behavior in Python."
