        "content": "The formula for calculating the surface area of a sphere is given by:\n\n\\[ \\text{Surface Area} = 4\\pi r^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the sphere.\n\nFor a sphere with a radius of 3 units, the surface area would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Surface Area} = 4\\pi (3)^2 = 36\\pi \\]\n\nIf you approximate \\(\\pi\\) as 3.14159, then the surface area is approximately:\n\n\\[ \\text{Surface Area} \\approx 36 \\times 3.14159 \\approx 113.097 \\text{ square units} \\]\n\n### Real-Life Application Example: Painting a Spherical Water Tower\n\nSuppose you need to paint a spherical water tower with a radius of 3 units (let's assume 3 meters for a real-world scenario). To determine the amount of paint needed, you first calculate the surface area as shown above. If 1 liter of paint covers 10 square meters, you would need approximately 11.31 liters of paint to cover the entire surface (since 113.097 square meters / 10 square meters per liter = 11.31 liters).\n\n### Relation to the Volume of a Sphere\n\nThe formula for the volume of a sphere is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 \\]\n\nBoth the surface area and volume formulas involve the constant \\(\\pi\\) and powers of the radius \\(r\\). The surface area formula involves \\(r^2\\), indicating how the surface grows with the square of the radius, whereas the volume formula involves \\(r^3\\), showing how the volume grows with the cube of the radius. \n\nThis relationship highlights that as a sphere's size increases, its volume grows faster than its surface area due to the cubic factor in the volume formula compared to the square factor in the surface area formula. This is an important consideration in many real-world applications, such as material usage and structural design."
