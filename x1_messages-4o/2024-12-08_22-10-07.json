        "content": "Certainly! Let's explore how statistics are utilized in Data Science, Actuarial Science, and Market Research, incorporating machine learning techniques, and provide examples in R code and SQL query formats.\n\n### Data Science\n**Example**: Predicting Customer Churn using Logistic Regression\n\nIn Data Science, statistics are often used to build predictive models. Logistic Regression, a statistical method, is frequently employed to predict binary outcomes. Here, we'll use it to predict whether a customer will churn.\n\n**R Code**:\n```r\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(caret)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Load the dataset\ndata <- read.csv(\"customer_churn.csv\")\n\n# Split the data into training and testing sets\nset.seed(123)\ntrainIndex <- createDataPartition(data$Churn, p = .8, \n                                  list = FALSE, \n                                  times = 1)\ntrainData <- data[ trainIndex,]\ntestData  <- data[-trainIndex,]\n\n# Train a logistic regression model\nmodel <- train(Churn ~ ., data = trainData, method = \"glm\", family = \"binomial\")\n\n# Predict on test data\npredictions <- predict(model, testData)\n\n# Evaluate the model\nconfusionMatrix(predictions, testData$Churn)\n```\n\n**SQL Query**:\n```sql\nSELECT CustomerID, \n       CASE \n           WHEN Probability > 0.5 THEN 'Yes'\n           ELSE 'No' \n       END AS PredictedChurn\nFROM (\n    SELECT CustomerID,\n           1 / (1 + EXP(-(Intercept + Coefficient1 * Feature1 + Coefficient2 * Feature2))) AS Probability\n    FROM CustomerData\n) AS PredictionTable;\n```\n\n### Actuarial Science\n**Example**: Predicting Insurance Claims using Decision Trees\n\nActuarial Science often involves predicting future claims to set premiums. Decision Trees can be used for classification tasks in this domain.\n\n**R Code**:\n```r\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(rpart)\nlibrary(rpart.plot)\n\n# Load the dataset\ndata <- read.csv(\"insurance_claims.csv\")\n\n# Train a decision tree model\nmodel <- rpart(Claim ~ ., data = data, method = \"class\")\n\n# Plot the decision tree\nrpart.plot(model)\n\n# Predict on new data\nnew_data <- data.frame(Age = 30, Gender = \"Male\", VehicleType = \"Sedan\")\nprediction <- predict(model, new_data, type = \"class\")\nprint(prediction)\n```\n\n**SQL Query**:\n```sql\nWITH DecisionTree AS (\n    SELECT *,\n           CASE \n               WHEN Condition THEN 'HighRisk'\n               ELSE 'LowRisk'\n           END AS RiskCategory\n    FROM InsuranceData\n)\nSELECT CustomerID, RiskCategory\nFROM DecisionTree;\n```\n\n### Market Research\n**Example**: Segmenting Customers using K-Means Clustering\n\nIn Market Research, customer segmentation is vital. K-Means Clustering, a statistical machine learning technique, is used to group customers based on similarities.\n\n**R Code**:\n```r\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(cluster)\n\n# Load the dataset\ndata <- read.csv(\"customer_data.csv\")\n\n# Normalize the data\ndata_scaled <- scale(data)\n\n# Perform K-Means Clustering\nset.seed(123)\nkmeans_model <- kmeans(data_scaled, centers = 3)\n\n# Add cluster to original data\ndata$Cluster <- kmeans_model$cluster\n\n# View the clustered data\nprint(head(data))\n```\n\n**SQL Query**:\n```sql\nWITH ScaledData AS (\n    SELECT CustomerID,\n           (Feature1 - AVG(Feature1) OVER()) / STDDEV(Feature1) OVER() AS ScaledFeature1,\n           (Feature2 - AVG(Feature2) OVER()) / STDDEV(Feature2) OVER() AS ScaledFeature2\n    FROM CustomerData\n),\nClusteredData AS (\n    SELECT CustomerID,\n           CASE \n               WHEN ScaledFeature1 < Threshold1 AND ScaledFeature2 < Threshold2 THEN 'Cluster1'\n               WHEN ScaledFeature1 >= Threshold1 AND ScaledFeature2 < Threshold2 THEN 'Cluster2'\n               ELSE 'Cluster3'\n           END AS Cluster\n    FROM ScaledData\n)\nSELECT CustomerID, Cluster\nFROM ClusteredData;\n```\n\nThese examples illustrate the application of statistical methods and machine learning techniques in different fields, using both R and SQL for data processing and analysis."
