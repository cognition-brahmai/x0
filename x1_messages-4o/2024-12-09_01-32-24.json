For a dictionary, I could use `iteritems()` to loop through key and value simultaneously, but I am unable to find a similar functionality for a NumPy array. Currently, I am manually tracking the index (`idx`) like this:\n\n```python\nidx = 0 \nfor j in theta:\n   some_function(idx,j,theta)\n   idx += 1\n```\nIs there a more efficient or pythonic way to achieve this?"

        "content": "Yes, there is a more pythonic way to iterate over a 1D NumPy array with both index and value using the `enumerate()` function. `enumerate()` adds a counter to an iterable and returns it in the form of an `enumerate` object, which can be directly used in loops. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ntheta = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])\n\nfor idx, j in enumerate(theta):\n    some_function(idx, j, theta)\n```\n\nThis approach is both concise and efficient, and it adheres to Python's idiomatic practices. The `enumerate()` function is a built-in feature of Python and works well with any iterable, including NumPy arrays."
