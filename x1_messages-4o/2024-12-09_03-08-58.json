I have multiple namedtuples that share some fields and I have a function that only interacts with these shared fields. I'm trying to typecheck this code with mypy. However, I'm encountering an error when I run mypy on my code. The error states that the argument 1 to \"DoSomething\" has an incompatible type \"BaseExtended\", where it was expecting \"Base\". Is there a way to structure my code to maintain mypy typechecking? I can't inherit \"BaseExtended\" from \"Base\" because of a bug in the NamedTuple inheritance implementation. Also, I don't want to use the Union[Base, BaseExtended] approach as it breaks when I try to typecheck a List, because List[Union[Base, BaseExtended]] is not equal to List[BaseExtended] due to some mypy rules about variant/covariant types. Should I abandon the idea of using subclassing with NamedTuple for type checking?"

        "content": "Subclassing `NamedTuple` can indeed be challenging when it comes to type checking with mypy, especially due to the limitations and peculiarities of type variance and inheritance. Here are a few approaches you could consider to address this issue:\n\n1. **Use Protocols**: Instead of relying on inheritance from `NamedTuple`, you can define a `Protocol` that specifies the shared fields. This allows you to use structural subtyping, which can be more flexible and avoids some of the pitfalls of inheritance with `NamedTuple`.\n\n   ```python\n   from typing import NamedTuple, Protocol\n\n   class BaseProtocol(Protocol):\n       shared_field: int\n\n   class Base(NamedTuple):\n       shared_field: int\n       specific_field: str\n\n   class BaseExtended(NamedTuple):\n       shared_field: int\n       extended_field: float\n\n   def do_something(item: BaseProtocol) -> None:\n       print(item.shared_field)\n\n   base_instance = Base(shared_field=1, specific_field=\"example\")\n   extended_instance = BaseExtended(shared_field=2, extended_field=3.14)\n\n   do_something(base_instance)          # This should type check\n   do_something(extended_instance)      # This should also type check\n   ```\n\n2. **Use TypedDict**: If your use case allows for the dictionary-like behavior, you might consider using `TypedDict` instead of `NamedTuple`. `TypedDict` is more flexible in terms of structural typing.\n\n   ```python\n   from typing import TypedDict\n\n   class BaseDict(TypedDict):\n       shared_field: int\n\n   class BaseExtendedDict(TypedDict):\n       shared_field: int\n       extended_field: float\n\n   def do_something(item: BaseDict) -> None:\n       print(item['shared_field'])\n\n   base_instance = BaseDict(shared_field=1)\n   extended_instance = BaseExtendedDict(shared_field=2, extended_field=3.14)\n\n   do_something(base_instance)          # This should type check\n   do_something(extended_instance)      # This should also type check\n   ```\n\n3. **Composition over Inheritance**: Instead of subclassing `NamedTuple`, you can create a separate class or function that operates on the shared fields and use that for type checking.\n\n4. **Type Aliases**: Use type aliases to define the common parts, though this may not solve the variance issue directly.\n\n5. **Custom Mypy Plugins**: If none of the above solutions are viable, and you're committed to using `NamedTuple` with inheritance, consider writing a custom mypy plugin that can handle your specific case.\n\nEach approach has its own trade-offs, and the best choice would depend on the specific requirements and constraints of your project. Using protocols is often a clean and flexible solution for cases where you have overlapping fields and want to enforce type checks without strict inheritance hierarchies."
