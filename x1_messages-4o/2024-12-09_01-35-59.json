For instance, given the source list:\n\n```python\ninput = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ... ]\n```\n\nIf the sub list length is 3, we want to achieve:\n\n```python\noutput = [ [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], ... ]\n```\n\nSimilarly, if the sub list length is 4, we aim to get:\n\n```python\noutput = [ [1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], ... ]\n```"

        "content": "To slice a list into sub-lists of arbitrary length, you can write a simple function in Python that uses list comprehension. This function will iterate over the original list in steps of the desired sub-list length and create sub-lists accordingly. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef slice_list(input_list, sublist_length):\n    # Using list comprehension to create sub-lists\n    return [input_list[i:i + sublist_length] for i in range(0, len(input_list), sublist_length)]\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nsublist_length_3 = slice_list(input_list, 3)\nsublist_length_4 = slice_list(input_list, 4)\n\nprint(\"Sub-lists of length 3:\", sublist_length_3)\nprint(\"Sub-lists of length 4:\", sublist_length_4)\n```\n\nThis function works by creating a range that starts at 0 and goes up to the length of the input list, incrementing by the `sublist_length` with each step. It then slices the input list from `i` to `i + sublist_length` for each `i` in the range, effectively creating sub-lists of the specified length. The result is a list of these sub-lists."
