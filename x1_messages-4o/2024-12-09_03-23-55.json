        "content": "The error message you're encountering suggests that the installation of the \"scholarly\" package is failing due to a missing OpenSSL header file (`openssl/opensslv.h`). This typically indicates that the OpenSSL development libraries are not installed on your system. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Install OpenSSL Development Libraries:**\n   You need to install the OpenSSL development package for your system. You can do this using your package manager. For a Debian-based system (like Ubuntu), you can run:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install libssl-dev\n   ```\n\n   If you're using a Red Hat-based system (like CentOS), you can use:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo yum install openssl-devel\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Python Development Headers:**\n   Since the error message indicates it's using Python 2.7, ensure the Python 2.7 development headers are installed. On Debian-based systems, use:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install python-dev\n   ```\n\n   On Red Hat-based systems, use:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo yum install python-devel\n   ```\n\n3. **Ensure pip is up to date:**\n   Make sure your `pip` is up to date to avoid any compatibility issues:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade pip\n   ```\n\n4. **Reattempt the Installation:**\n   After installing the necessary dependencies, try installing the package again:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install scholarly\n   ```\n\nThese steps should help resolve the issue by ensuring all necessary development libraries and headers are available for compiling the package. If you continue to have issues, double-check that all dependencies are correctly installed and consider any error messages provided during the installation process for further clues."
