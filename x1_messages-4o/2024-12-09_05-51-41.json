Even though I've enabled JavaScript in my browser, I keep receiving the following error: \"Opening Robot Framework log failed\". I'm using Mozilla Firefox version 45.0.2 on mac and have confirmed that my browser is modern enough. Is there any solution to this problem?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing with opening and converting Robot Framework .html files might be related to a few different factors. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Browser Compatibility**: Although you mentioned using Firefox 45.0.2, it's worth noting that this version is quite outdated. Consider updating your browser to the latest version to ensure compatibility with modern web technologies and JavaScript features.\n\n2. **JavaScript Settings**: Double-check your JavaScript settings in Firefox. Even if you've enabled JavaScript, there might be additional settings or extensions that are blocking scripts from running on certain pages. Try disabling extensions temporarily to see if they are causing the issue.\n\n3. **File Integrity**: Ensure that the .html files generated by Robot Framework are not corrupted. You can try generating the reports again and see if the issue persists.\n\n4. **Security Settings**: Firefox has security settings that might block local file access. Try adjusting these settings by typing `about:config` in the address bar, searching for `privacy.file_unique_origin`, and setting it to `false`. Remember to change it back after testing for security reasons.\n\n5. **Converting HTML to DOCX**:\n   - Use tools like Pandoc, which can convert HTML files to DOCX. Install Pandoc and run the following command in your terminal:\n     ```\n     pandoc input.html -o output.docx\n     ```\n   - Alternatively, you can use online conversion tools to convert HTML to DOCX.\n\n6. **Robot Framework Tools**: Consider using additional Robot Framework tools or plugins that might assist in generating reports in different formats directly.\n\nIf these steps don't resolve your issue, consider reaching out to the Robot Framework community or checking their forums for specific advice related to the version and configuration you are using."
