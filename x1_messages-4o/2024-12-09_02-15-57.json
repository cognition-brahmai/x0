Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport h5py\n\ndef print_dataset_names(name, obj):\n    # Check if the object is a dataset\n    if isinstance(obj, h5py.Dataset):\n        print(name)\n\n# Open the HDF5 file\nwith h5py.File('result.h5', 'r') as hf:\n    # Traverse the file structure and print dataset names\n    hf.visititems(print_dataset_names)\n```\n\nThis code uses the `visititems` method, which recursively visits all objects in the file. The `print_dataset_names` function checks if the current object is a dataset and prints its name if it is. This way, you can list all the dataset names in your HDF5 file."
