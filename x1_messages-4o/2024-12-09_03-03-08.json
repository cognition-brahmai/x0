        "content": "The error message \"catching classes that do not inherit from BaseException is not allowed\" indicates that your code is attempting to catch an exception using a class that does not inherit from `BaseException`. In Python, all exceptions must inherit from `BaseException`, which is the base class for all built-in exceptions.\n\nHere's how you can fix this issue:\n\n1. **Check Your Exception Handling**: Review the `try-except` blocks in your code. Make sure that every exception you are trying to catch is a subclass of `BaseException`.\n\n2. **Correct Exception Classes**: Ensure you are using the correct exception classes. For example, if you are trying to catch a generic exception, use `Exception` instead of a custom class that doesn't inherit from `BaseException`.\n\n3. **Custom Exceptions**: If you are using custom exception classes, ensure they are correctly defined by inheriting from `Exception` or another valid exception class. Here is an example:\n\n   ```python\n   class MyCustomError(Exception):\n       pass\n\n   try:\n       # Code that may raise an exception\n       pass\n   except MyCustomError as e:\n       # Handle the exception\n       print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Review Imports and Namespaces**: Double-check that you are importing the correct modules and classes, especially if you are working with third-party libraries that might have similarly named classes.\n\nOnce you have ensured all exceptions being caught are valid subclasses of `BaseException`, the error should be resolved."
