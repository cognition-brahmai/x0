        "content": "To convert a string to a list of words while removing punctuation and spaces, you can use Python's `str.split()` method in combination with the `re` module to remove punctuation. Here's one way to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nstring = 'This is a string, with words!'\n\n# Remove punctuation using regular expressions\nclean_string = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s]', '', string)\n\n# Split the string into words\nword_list = clean_string.split()\n\nprint(word_list)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of how this works:\n\n1. **Regular Expression (`re.sub`)**: The `re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s]', '', string)` function call uses a regular expression to remove any character that is not a word character (`\\w`) or a whitespace character (`\\s`). This effectively strips out punctuation from the string.\n\n2. **Split**: After cleaning the string of punctuation, `split()` is used to divide the string into a list of words. It splits the string at any whitespace and returns a list of words.\n\nThe output of the above code will be:\n\n```\n['This', 'is', 'a', 'string', 'with', 'words']\n```\n\nThis method is efficient and handles various punctuation marks by removing them before splitting the string into words."
