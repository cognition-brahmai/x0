We can then convert this energy usage into carbon emissions using the city's average carbon emissions rate.\nTo calculate the industry's contribution to landfill waste, we can use the total amount of clothing discarded in New York City in 2019, which was 190,000 tons.\nUsing these calculations, the environmental impact of the fashion industry in New York City can be estimated using the following formula: \nTotal environmental impact = (water usage x environmental impact factor) + (carbon emissions x environmental impact factor) + (landfill waste x environmental impact factor)\nWhere \"environmental impact factor\" represents the relative impact of each factor on the environment."

However, you've mentioned an \"environmental impact factor\" without specifying its values for each component. For the purpose of this exercise, let's assume arbitrary values for the environmental impact factors for demonstration. Adjust these values based on actual data or expert input for real-world applications.\n\n1. **Water Usage:**\n   - Water used in 2019: 12.5 billion gallons\n   - Assume an environmental impact factor for water: \\(E_{water} = 1.0\\) (arbitrary)\n\n2. **Carbon Emissions:**\n   - To calculate carbon emissions, you'll need the total energy consumption data and the average carbon emissions rate.\n   - For this example, let's assume 1 kilogram of CO2 is emitted per 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) of energy (you'll need actual data for precise calculations).\n   - Suppose the fashion industry used 1 billion kWh of energy in 2019.\n   - Carbon emissions: \\(1 \\text{ billion kWh} \\times 1 \\text{ kg CO2/kWh} = 1 \\text{ billion kg CO2}\\)\n   - Assume an environmental impact factor for carbon emissions: \\(E_{carbon} = 1.5\\) (arbitrary)\n\n3. **Landfill Waste:**\n   - Clothing discarded in 2019: 190,000 tons\n   - Assume an environmental impact factor for landfill waste: \\(E_{landfill} = 2.0\\) (arbitrary)\n\nNow, substitute these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total environmental impact} = (12.5 \\text{ billion gallons} \\times 1.0) + (1 \\text{ billion kg CO2} \\times 1.5) + (190,000 \\text{ tons} \\times 2.0)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 12.5 \\text{ billion} + 1.5 \\text{ billion} + 380,000\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 14.38 \\text{ billion units of impact}\n\\]\n\nThis calculation provides a simplified estimate of the environmental impact in arbitrary units. In practice, you would need specific environmental impact factors based on scientific research to provide a more accurate assessment."
