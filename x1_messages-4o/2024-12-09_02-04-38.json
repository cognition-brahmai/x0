Here's how you can do it:\n\nUsing `declare`:\n```bash\ndeclare -f foobar\n```\n\nUsing `typeset`:\n```bash\ntypeset -f foobar\n```\n\nBoth of these commands will output the definition of the `foobar` function, which includes the function name and the code it executes. The `-f` option is used to specify that you want the function definition."
