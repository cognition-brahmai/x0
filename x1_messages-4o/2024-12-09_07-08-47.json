        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the `cross_validation` module being deprecated in recent versions of `scikit-learn`. Instead, you should use the `model_selection` module, which is the updated and correct way to split your dataset into training and testing sets.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use the correct module:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\n# Assuming X is your feature set and df1['ENTRIESn_hourly'] is your target variable\nX_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, df1['ENTRIESn_hourly'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `train_test_split` is the function used to split the dataset.\n- `test_size=0.2` specifies that 20% of the data should be used as the test set. You can adjust this value as needed.\n- `random_state=42` is used to ensure that the split is reproducible. You can use any integer for reproducibility, or omit it if you want the split to be random each time.\n\nMake sure you have the necessary imports and that your dataset (`X` and `df1['ENTRIESn_hourly']`) is correctly defined. This should resolve the attribute error and allow you to split your dataset correctly."
