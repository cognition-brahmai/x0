I want to use MyThing's as keys that are considered the same if 'name' and 'location' are the same. I know from C#/Java that I need to override and provide an equals and hashcode method, and promise not to mutate anything the hashcode depends on. How can I accomplish this in Python? \n\nIn a simpler case, I could just use a (name,location) tuple as a key, but in this case, I want the key to be an object. Here is the code for my class:\n\n```python\nclass MyThing:\n    def __init__(self,name,location,length):\n        self.name = name\n        self.location = location\n        self.length = length\n```"

        "content": "To use instances of your `MyThing` class as keys in a Python dictionary and have them considered equal based on the `name` and `location` attributes, you need to override the `__eq__` and `__hash__` methods. These methods serve a similar purpose to the `equals` and `hashCode` methods in Java or C#. By doing so, you ensure that two `MyThing` instances with the same `name` and `location` are treated as the same key in the dictionary. Here\u2019s how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nclass MyThing:\n    def __init__(self, name, location, length):\n        self.name = name\n        self.location = location\n        self.length = length\n\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        if isinstance(other, MyThing):\n            return self.name == other.name and self.location == other.location\n        return False\n\n    def __hash__(self):\n        # Combine the hash of the name and location for the hash of this object\n        return hash((self.name, self.location))\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        # Optional: A string representation of the object for easier debugging\n        return f\"MyThing(name={self.name}, location={self.location}, length={self.length})\"\n\n# Example usage\nthing1 = MyThing(\"ThingA\", \"Location1\", 10)\nthing2 = MyThing(\"ThingA\", \"Location1\", 20)\nthing3 = MyThing(\"ThingB\", \"Location2\", 30)\n\n# Dictionary with MyThing objects as keys\nmy_dict = {thing1: \"First Thing\", thing3: \"Second Thing\"}\n\nprint(my_dict[thing1])  # Output: First Thing\nprint(my_dict[thing2])  # Output: First Thing, because thing1 and thing2 are considered equal\nprint(my_dict.get(thing3))  # Output: Second Thing\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **`__eq__` Method**: This method is used to compare two objects for equality. In this case, it checks if both `name` and `location` attributes are equal.\n\n2. **`__hash__` Method**: This method returns an integer hash value for the object. By combining the hashes of `name` and `location` in a tuple, you ensure that the hash is consistent with the equality check.\n\n3. **Immutability**: Make sure that the attributes used in `__eq__` and `__hash__` (in this case, `name` and `location`) are not changed after the object is created. This is important because changing these attributes would change the hash value and could lead to inconsistencies in dictionary key lookup.\n\nThis implementation allows `MyThing` objects to be used as dictionary keys with the desired equality and hashing behavior."
