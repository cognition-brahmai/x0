The server runs successfully in the backend. However, I am trying to enable authentication in airflow and have made configuration changes in airflow.cfg, but the authentication functionality is not reflected in the server. When I stop and start the airflow server on my local machine, it works. How can I restart my daemon airflow webserver process on my server?"

        "content": "To restart the Airflow webserver process running as a daemon, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Locate the PID File:**\n   When you run the Airflow webserver as a daemon using the `-D` flag, it creates a PID (Process ID) file. This file is typically located in the `airflow` home directory (at `~/airflow/airflow-webserver.pid` by default, but it can vary based on your configuration).\n\n2. **Stop the Webserver:**\n   To stop the webserver, you can kill the process using the PID from the PID file. Execute the following commands:\n\n   ```bash\n   PID=$(cat ~/airflow/airflow-webserver.pid)\n   kill $PID\n   ```\n\n   This will terminate the existing Airflow webserver process.\n\n3. **Verify the Process has Stopped:**\n   It's always a good idea to check if the process has indeed stopped. You can do this by checking running processes:\n\n   ```bash\n   ps aux | grep airflow\n   ```\n\n   Ensure that there are no leftover processes related to the webserver.\n\n4. **Restart the Webserver:**\n   Now, restart the Airflow webserver. Use the same command you used initially, making sure to include the `-D` flag to run it as a daemon again:\n\n   ```bash\n   airflow webserver -p 8080 -D\n   ```\n\n5. **Check Logs:**\n   If you encounter any issues, check the Airflow logs for more information. The logs are usually located in the `~/airflow/logs` directory by default.\n\n6. **Test Authentication:**\n   After restarting, access the Airflow web UI and check if the authentication changes you made are now in effect.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to restart your daemonized Airflow webserver and ensure that your configuration changes take effect."
