This library is based on CMU Pronouncing Dictionary data and can be used to find words that rhyme with a given word. Here's the complete code:\n\n```python\nimport pronouncing\n\n# Define the word to find rhymes for\nword = \"mouse\"\n\n# Get the list of rhyming words\nrhymes = pronouncing.rhymes(word)\n\n# Print the rhyming words\nprint(\"The rhyming words for\", word, \"are:\", rhymes)\n```\n\nTo run this code, you'll need to install the `pronouncing` library if you haven't already. You can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install pronouncing\n```\n\nOnce the library is installed, you can execute the code, and it will print a list of words that rhyme with \"mouse\"."
