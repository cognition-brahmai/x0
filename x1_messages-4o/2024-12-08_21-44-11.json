        "content": "Conducting an extensive search for credible sources on topics like Climate Change and US Presidential Elections with a specified publication date range can be efficiently achieved using a combination of advanced search techniques on search engines and databases. Below is a strategy and an example HTML code snippet to help you in this process:\n\n### Strategy\n\n1. **Use Advanced Search Features**: Utilize Google Scholar, academic databases like JSTOR, or databases of news articles and journals to filter sources by date and relevance.\n\n2. **Search Query Construction**: Use specific keywords and date filters to refine your search. For Google, you can use the `before:` and `after:` operators to limit your search to specific years.\n\n3. **Library Access**: If you have access to university or public libraries, use their databases to access peer-reviewed articles.\n\n4. **Bookmarking and Organizing**: Use tools like Zotero or Mendeley to save and organize your sources.\n\n### Example HTML Code\n\nBelow is an example HTML code snippet that includes a basic form to help you quickly search Google with advanced parameters directly from a webpage. This is a simple tool and should be complemented with manual refinement and verification of sources.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Search for Credible Sources</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Search for Credible Sources on Climate Change and US Presidential Elections</h1>\n    <form action=\"https://www.google.com/search\" method=\"get\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <label for=\"query\">Enter your keywords:</label><br>\n        <input type=\"text\" id=\"query\" name=\"q\" value=\"Climate Change US Presidential Elections\"><br><br>\n        \n        <label for=\"daterange\">Select Date Range:</label><br>\n        <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"tbs\" value=\"cdr:1,cd_min:01/01/2020,cd_max:12/31/2023\">\n        <input type=\"text\" id=\"daterange\" value=\"2020-2023\" disabled><br><br>\n        \n        <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Search\">\n    </form>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- **Use Boolean Operators**: Combine search terms with operators like AND, OR, and NOT to narrow or expand your search.\n\n- **Database Filters**: Use filters available in academic databases to limit by publication type, subject area, and publication date.\n\n- **Evaluate Sources**: Always assess the credibility of your sources by considering the author's credentials, publication outlet, and the presence of peer review.\n\nThis HTML form is a basic starting point and can be enhanced with JavaScript or additional input fields for more complex queries. Always ensure that the sources you choose are credible by evaluating the publisher, the author's expertise, and the presence of citations in the documents themselves."
