        "content": "To write a Java program that reverses the words in a given sentence while maintaining the sentence's original meaning, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Split the sentence into words.\n2. Reverse the list of words.\n3. Join the reversed list back into a sentence.\n\nHere's a Java program that demonstrates this process:\n\n```java\npublic class ReverseWords {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String sentence = \"Across the yard, the cat was chased by the dog.\";\n        String reversedSentence = reverseWords(sentence);\n        System.out.println(reversedSentence);\n    }\n\n    public static String reverseWords(String sentence) {\n        // Split the sentence into words using space as a delimiter\n        String[] words = sentence.split(\" \");\n        \n        // Use a StringBuilder to efficiently reverse the words\n        StringBuilder reversedSentence = new StringBuilder();\n        \n        // Iterate over the words array in reverse order\n        for (int i = words.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n            reversedSentence.append(words[i]);\n            \n            // Add a space between words (but not after the last word)\n            if (i != 0) {\n                reversedSentence.append(\" \");\n            }\n        }\n        \n        return reversedSentence.toString();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Splitting the Sentence**: We use `split(\" \")` to break the sentence into individual words based on spaces.\n- **Reversing the Words**: We iterate over the array from the last element to the first and append each word to a `StringBuilder`.\n- **Joining the Words**: We append a space between words while making sure not to add an extra space at the end.\n\n### Example Execution:\nFor the sentence \"Across the yard, the cat was chased by the dog.\", the program will output:\n```\ndog. the by chased was cat the yard, the Across\n```\n\nThis effectively reverses the order of the words while keeping each word's internal structure intact."
