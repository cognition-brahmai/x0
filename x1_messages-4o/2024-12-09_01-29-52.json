I've used the commands `sphinx-build -b html source build` as well as `make html`, but in both attempts, only the html files search.html, index.html, and genindex.html are generated. The file modindex.html is missing, even though I have set `html_domain_indices = True` in the conf.py file. I receive no error message after building the html files. I am currently using Sphinx 1.1.3 and Python 2.7 on Windows XP. What could be the problem causing the missing modindex.html file?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The issue you're experiencing with the missing `modindex.html` file, despite setting `html_domain_indices = True`, could be due to a few potential reasons:\n\n1. **Old Version of Sphinx**: You are using a relatively old version of Sphinx (1.1.3). There might be bugs or missing features in this version that could affect the generation of the module index. Consider upgrading to a newer version of Sphinx if possible. Note that this may require upgrading your Python version as well, since Python 2.7 is no longer supported.\n\n2. **Presence of Modules**: The `modindex.html` file is generated only if there are documented modules/packages in your source files. Ensure that you have documented modules with the appropriate `automodule`, `autoclass`, etc., directives in your reStructuredText files.\n\n3. **Configuration Settings**: Double-check your `conf.py` settings:\n   - Ensure that `extensions` includes `'sphinx.ext.autodoc'` or any other relevant extensions needed for your documentation.\n   - Verify that `html_domain_indices = True` is correctly set and not overridden elsewhere in your configuration.\n\n4. **Source File Content**: Ensure that your source `.rst` files correctly reference the modules you want to document. The `automodule` directive should be used to include the modules in the documentation.\n\n5. **Build Directory**: Make sure you are looking in the correct build directory for the `modindex.html` file. If you have multiple build directories, it could be placed in a different directory than expected.\n\n6. **Output Logs**: Although you mentioned not receiving error messages, it can be helpful to check the output logs from `sphinx-build` for any warnings or notices that might provide clues.\n\n7. **Rebuilding**: Sometimes, stale build files can cause issues. Try cleaning your build directory (`make clean` if using a Makefile) and then rebuilding the documentation.\n\nIf you are unable to upgrade your Python or Sphinx version due to system constraints, consider setting up a virtual environment on a different machine with a more recent setup to test if the issue persists."
