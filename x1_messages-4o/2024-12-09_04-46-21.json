For instance, when I execute the following code snippet in Sublime Text:\n\n```python\nwhile True:\n    print('loop')\n```\n\nI can't seem to be able to stop it and have to manually kill the process and restart Sublime Text. Is there a way to set a 'max_execution_time' or any other workaround which would allow me to stop this process in a more graceful manner?"

        "content": "Sublime Text itself doesn\u2019t have a built-in feature to set a `max_execution_time` for scripts, as it\u2019s primarily a text editor and not a full-fledged IDE. However, there are a few workarounds you can consider to handle infinite loops more gracefully:\n\n1. **Use a Terminal or Command Prompt:**\n   - Instead of running your code directly in Sublime Text, you can run your Python script from a terminal or command prompt. This way, you can easily interrupt the execution using `Ctrl + C`.\n\n2. **Use a Timeout Decorator:**\n   - You can use a timeout decorator in your Python code to limit the execution time of a function. Here is an example using `signal`:\n\n     ```python\n     import signal\n     import time\n\n     class TimeoutException(Exception):\n         pass\n\n     def timeout_handler(signum, frame):\n         raise TimeoutException()\n\n     # Set the timeout handler\n     signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, timeout_handler)\n\n     # Set the timeout duration (in seconds)\n     signal.alarm(5)  # Set to 5 seconds for example\n\n     try:\n         while True:\n             print('loop')\n             time.sleep(1)\n     except TimeoutException:\n         print(\"Timeout! Loop stopped.\")\n     finally:\n         # Disable the alarm\n         signal.alarm(0)\n     ```\n\n3. **Limit Loop Iterations:**\n   - If the infinite loop is just for testing, you might want to set a condition to break the loop after a certain number of iterations:\n\n     ```python\n     counter = 0\n     while True:\n         print('loop')\n         counter += 1\n         if counter > 100:  # Stop after 100 iterations\n             break\n     ```\n\n4. **Debugging and Testing:**\n   - Use debugging tools that allow you to step through the code and stop execution when needed. Sublime Text can be integrated with external debuggers that can assist with this.\n\nBy employing these strategies, you can avoid having to manually kill the process and restart Sublime Text every time you encounter an infinite loop."
