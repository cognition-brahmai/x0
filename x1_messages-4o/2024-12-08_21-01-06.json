I want you to find the month with the highest increase in the number of houses sold compared to the previous month. Please provide your answer along with the percentage increase in sales. Remember to label the horizontal axis as \"month\" and the vertical axis as \"number of houses sold\" on your visual representation. The data points for the months are January (5), February (12), March (6), April (14), May (5), and June (10). Good luck!"

        "content": "To analyze the data and determine the month with the highest increase in the number of houses sold compared to the previous month, let's calculate the percentage increase for each month where there is an increase. Here's the data:\n\n- January: 5 houses sold\n- February: 12 houses sold\n- March: 6 houses sold\n- April: 14 houses sold\n- May: 5 houses sold\n- June: 10 houses sold\n\n### Calculating Percentage Increases:\n\n1. **From January to February:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{12 - 5}{5} \\right) \\times 100 = 140\\%\n   \\]\n\n2. **From February to March:**\n   - No increase (sales decreased).\n\n3. **From March to April:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{14 - 6}{6} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 133.33\\%\n   \\]\n\n4. **From April to May:**\n   - No increase (sales decreased).\n\n5. **From May to June:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{10 - 5}{5} \\right) \\times 100 = 100\\%\n   \\]\n\n### Results:\nThe month with the highest increase in the number of houses sold compared to the previous month is **February**, with a **140%** increase.\n\n### Visual Representation:\n\nTo visualize this, imagine a line graph where the horizontal axis is labeled \"month\" and the vertical axis is labeled \"number of houses sold.\"\n\n- **January**: 5\n- **February**: 12\n- **March**: 6\n- **April**: 14\n- **May**: 5\n- **June**: 10\n\nYou would see significant rises from January to February and March to April, with the steepest increase between January and February."
