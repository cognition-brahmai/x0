        "content": "Certainly! Calculating the mean (average) of a dataset in Excel is straightforward. Here are the steps you can follow:\n\n1. **Open Excel**: Start by opening Microsoft Excel on your computer.\n\n2. **Enter the Data**: \n   - Click on cell A1.\n   - Enter the numbers in column A, one per cell. For your dataset, it will look like this:\n     - A1: 2\n     - A2: 5\n     - A3: 7\n     - A4: 8\n     - A5: 10\n\n3. **Select a Cell for the Mean**:\n   - Click on cell A6 or any other empty cell where you want the mean to be displayed.\n\n4. **Calculate the Mean**:\n   - In the selected cell (A6), type the formula to calculate the mean:\n     ```\n     =AVERAGE(A1:A5)\n     ```\n   - Press `Enter`.\n\n5. **View the Result**: \n   - The cell where you entered the formula will now display the mean of the numbers in your dataset.\n\nIn your case, the mean is calculated as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Mean} = \\frac{2 + 5 + 7 + 8 + 10}{5} = \\frac{32}{5} = 6.4\n\\]\n\nSo, the mean of your dataset is 6.4."
