Let's assume Column A contains the words and Column B contains the definitions.\n\n2. **Use Text Filter**: \n   - Click on the header of the column that contains the definitions (e.g., Column B).\n   - Go to the \"Data\" tab on the Excel ribbon.\n   - Click on \"Filter\" to apply a filter to your column headers.\n   - Click the drop-down arrow in the header of the definitions column.\n   - Use the \"Text Filters\" option to select \"Contains...\".\n   - In the dialog box that appears, type \"without a clearly defined shape or form\" and press OK.\n\n3. **Review Results**: \n   - Excel will filter the list to show only the rows where the definition contains the phrase \"without a clearly defined shape or form\".\n   - Check the corresponding word(s) in Column A to find another word with the same meaning as \"amorphous\".\n\nIf the definition is exactly the same, this method will help you find any synonyms or words with similar meanings that are described in the same way in your sheet."
