        "content": "To generate a random number within a specified range in C, you can use the `rand()` function from the C Standard Library. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:\n\n1. **Include the necessary headers**: You need to include `<stdlib.h>` for `rand()` and `<time.h>` for `time()`.\n\n2. **Seed the random number generator**: You should seed the random number generator using `srand()` with a value that changes, like the current time. This ensures that you get different sequences of random numbers each time you run your program.\n\n3. **Generate the random number**: Use `rand()` to generate a random number and then scale it to your desired range.\n\nHere is a simple program demonstrating these steps:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <time.h>\n\nint main() {\n    // Seed the random number generator\n    srand(time(NULL));\n\n    // Define the range\n    int lower = 10; // Lower bound of the range\n    int upper = 50; // Upper bound of the range\n\n    // Generate a random number within the range\n    int random_number = (rand() % (upper - lower + 1)) + lower;\n\n    // Print the random number\n    printf(\"Random number between %d and %d: %d\\n\", lower, upper, random_number);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`srand(time(NULL));`**: Seeds the random number generator with the current time. This ensures that each run of the program generates a different sequence of random numbers.\n\n- **`rand() % (upper - lower + 1) + lower;`**: This expression generates a random number between the specified `lower` and `upper` bounds. The formula works by first getting a random number between `0` and `(upper - lower)`, then adding `lower` to shift it into the desired range.\n\nThis code will output a random number between 10 and 50 each time you run it. Adjust the `lower` and `upper` variables to change the range as needed."
