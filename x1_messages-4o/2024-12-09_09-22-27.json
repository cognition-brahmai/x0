        "content": "Certainly! A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. Here's a simple algorithm in Python to determine whether a given string is a palindrome:\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(s):\n    # Convert the string to lowercase to ensure the check is case-insensitive\n    s = s.lower()\n    \n    # Remove any non-alphanumeric characters\n    s = ''.join(char for char in s if char.isalnum())\n    \n    # Compare the string with its reverse\n    return s == s[::-1]\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_string = \"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama\"\nif is_palindrome(input_string):\n    print(f'\"{input_string}\" is a palindrome.')\nelse:\n    print(f'\"{input_string}\" is not a palindrome.')\n```\n\n### How it works:\n1. **Case Insensitivity**: The string is converted to lowercase to make the palindrome check case-insensitive.\n2. **Removing Non-Alphanumeric Characters**: Any character that is not a letter or number is removed. This is useful for checking sentences or phrases where punctuation and spaces should be ignored.\n3. **Comparison with Reverse**: The string is compared with its reverse to determine if it's a palindrome.\n\nThis algorithm handles both simple and complex cases, such as phrases with spaces and punctuation."
