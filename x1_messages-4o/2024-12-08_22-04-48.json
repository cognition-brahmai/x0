Mind if I join you? It\u2019s so crowded today.\n\n**Alex:** *[looking up from his book]* Oh, not at all. Please, have a seat! I\u2019m Alex, by the way.\n\n**Emma:** Thanks, Alex. I\u2019m Emma. What are you reading?\n\n**Alex:** It\u2019s a science fiction novel by Liu Cixin. I\u2019m really into sci-fi. How about you? Do you enjoy reading?\n\n**Emma:** I do, actually! I\u2019m more into historical fiction, though. There\u2019s something fascinating about diving into different eras. \n\n**Alex:** That\u2019s interesting! Historical fiction always seems like such an adventure through time. Do you have a favorite period you like to read about?\n\n**Emma:** Definitely the Victorian era. I love the complexity of society and the fashion of that time. What about you? Why sci-fi?\n\n**Alex:** For me, it\u2019s the endless possibilities. Sci-fi allows us to imagine the future and explore the unknown. It\u2019s like a playground for the mind. \n\n**Emma:** I can see that. It must be exciting to think about what the future holds. Do you write as well, or just read?\n\n**Alex:** I dabble in writing a bit, mostly short stories. It\u2019s a good way to unwind. What about you? Ever tried writing your own historical tales?\n\n**Emma:** I\u2019ve thought about it, but I haven\u2019t quite taken the plunge yet. Maybe one day! It\u2019s inspiring to meet someone who writes, though. \n\n**Alex:** If you ever decide to start, I\u2019d love to read your work. It\u2019s always refreshing to see history through a fresh perspective.\n\n**Emma:** Thanks, Alex. I\u2019ll keep that in mind. Maybe I can borrow some of your bravery to give it a go!\n\n**Alex:** *[chuckles]* Deal! And if you ever want to swap books, I\u2019m always up for discovering new genres.\n\n**Emma:** Sounds like a plan! It\u2019s great to meet someone with similar interests. Here\u2019s to new friendships and shared stories.\n\n**Alex:** Cheers to that, Emma. Here\u2019s hoping for many more conversations over coffee.\n\n---\n\n*The two continue to chat, sharing their favorite books and enjoying the rainy afternoon.*"
