        "content": "I'm facing an issue when trying to execute a Python script on AWS Lambda. I need my script to make a rest-call once per day, and for this, I'm using the \"requests\" package. However, I'm unable to pack the \"requests\" package into my Python package on AWS Lambda. The error message I get is \"Unable to import module 'lambda_function': No module named lambda_function\". This issue only happens when I include \"import requests\" in my script. I've already set all permissions to `chmod 777` for the zip and project folder, placed the script in the root folder, and installed the requests package into the root-folder of the project using `sudo pip install requests -t PATH_TO_ROOT_FOLDER`. My zip file is named `lambda_function.zip`, my python file is `lambda_function.py`, the handler method is `lambda_handler(event, context)`, and the handler-definition in the webconfig is `lambda_function.lambda_handler`. The script I'm trying to run is:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\n\ndef lambda_handler(event, context):\n    url = 'xxx.elasticbeanstalk.com/users/login'\n    headers = {\"content-type\": \"application/json\", \"Authorization\": \"Basic Zxxxxxxxxx3NjxxZxxxxzcw==\" }\n    response = requests.put(url, headers=headers, verify=False)\n    return 'hello lambda_handler'\n```\nDespite multiple attempts, I'm unable to resolve this issue. Can you provide a solution?"

        "content": "When deploying Python code to AWS Lambda, especially with dependencies like `requests`, there are a few steps you need to follow to ensure that your Lambda function has access to all the necessary libraries. Here are some steps to help you troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Python Version**: Ensure that the Python version you're using locally is the same as the one configured in your AWS Lambda environment. This can affect how dependencies are installed and packaged.\n\n2. **Re-create the Deployment Package**:\n   - Create a new directory (let's call it `lambda_package`).\n   - Inside this directory, install the `requests` package using pip without elevated permissions:\n     ```bash\n     pip install requests -t /path/to/lambda_package\n     ```\n   - Ensure your `lambda_function.py` file is also in this directory.\n\n3. **Package Your Code**:\n   - Navigate to the `lambda_package` directory.\n   - Zip the contents of this directory (not the directory itself):\n     ```bash\n     cd /path/to/lambda_package\n     zip -r ../lambda_function.zip .\n     ```\n\n4. **Permissions**: Setting permissions to `chmod 777` is generally not recommended, as it gives full access to everyone. However, it is not usually related to import errors in Lambda. Ensure that your files have adequate read permissions.\n\n5. **Upload and Test**:\n   - Upload the `lambda_function.zip` file to AWS Lambda using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.\n   - Ensure that the handler is correctly set to `lambda_function.lambda_handler`.\n\n6. **Verify the File Structure**: Make sure the `requests` module is present in the zip file. You can do this by unzipping the `lambda_function.zip` and checking if the `requests` directory exists.\n\n7. **Lambda Layer** (Optional): If the `requests` package is causing size issues, consider using a Lambda Layer to include the `requests` library. You can create a Lambda Layer with the necessary dependencies and attach it to your Lambda function.\n\n8. **VPC Configuration**: If your Lambda is in a VPC, ensure it has internet access to reach external URLs.\n\n9. **Check the Logs**: Use AWS CloudWatch Logs to check for any additional error messages that might give more context on why the import is failing.\n\nIf these steps do not resolve the issue, it could be helpful to test your deployment package locally or use a Docker container that mimics the AWS Lambda environment to identify the problem."
