I have a form on one page that I want to submit to another page, but I can't figure out how to create the link to that second page. My project layout looks like this:\n\n```\nFileserver/\n    config.py\n    requirements.txt\n    run.py\n    setup.py\n    app/\n        __init__.py\n        static/\n            css/\n            img/\n            js/\n        templates/\n            formAction.html\n            formSubmit.html\n            index.html\n```\n\nIn my `__init__.py` file, I have:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef index():\n    ip = request.remote_addr\n    return render_template('index.html', user_ip=ip)\n```\n\nAnd in my `index.html` file, I have tried creating a link to the formSubmit.html page like so:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<body>\n    <ul>\n        <li><a href=\"/formSubmit.html\">Check Out This Form!</a>\n    </ul>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nI can see the page at localhost:5000/ without issue. I have also tried:\n\n```html\n<a href=\"{{ url_for('templates', 'formSubmit\") }}\">\n```\n\nand:\n\n```html\n<a href=\"{{ url_for('formSubmit') }}\">\n```\n\nBut neither of these are working. What am I missing?"

        "content": "To create a link to another HTML page in your Flask application, you need to define a route in your Flask app that corresponds to the page you want to link to. In your case, you want to link to the `formSubmit.html` page. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Define a Route for the Form Submission Page:**\n\n   In your `__init__.py` file, you need to define a new route that will render the `formSubmit.html` template. Add the following code to your `__init__.py` file:\n\n   ```python\n   from flask import Flask, render_template, request\n\n   app = Flask(__name__)\n\n   @app.route('/')\n   def index():\n       ip = request.remote_addr\n       return render_template('index.html', user_ip=ip)\n\n   @app.route('/formSubmit')\n   def form_submit():\n       return render_template('formSubmit.html')\n   ```\n\n2. **Update Your HTML to Use `url_for`:**\n\n   In your `index.html` file, you should use the `url_for` function to create URLs dynamically. This function generates the appropriate URL for the given endpoint, ensuring that it matches the route you defined in your Flask app. Update your link as follows:\n\n   ```html\n   <!DOCTYPE html>\n   <html lang=\"en\">\n   <body>\n       <ul>\n           <li><a href=\"{{ url_for('form_submit') }}\">Check Out This Form!</a></li>\n       </ul>\n   </body>\n   </html>\n   ```\n\n   In this example, `'form_submit'` is the name of the function you defined in your route (`@app.route('/formSubmit')`).\n\n3. **Ensure Templates Exist:**\n\n   Make sure that the `formSubmit.html` file exists in your `templates` directory. The Flask application will look for templates in this directory by default.\n\n4. **Run Your Application:**\n\n   Ensure your Flask application is running. You can typically do this with a command like:\n\n   ```bash\n   flask run\n   ```\n\n   Or, if you're using a script like `run.py`, make sure it's set up to start the Flask app.\n\nWith these steps, clicking the link in your `index.html` should take you to the `formSubmit.html` page. If you encounter any issues, double-check your route definitions and ensure there are no typos in your template file names or route names."
