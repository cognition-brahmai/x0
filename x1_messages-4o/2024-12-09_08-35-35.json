I have a list of values like `raw = [0.07, 0.14, 0.07]` and I want to normalize them to get a list like `normed = [0.25, 0.50, 0.25]`. Is there a built-in function in Python to automate this process?"

        "content": "To normalize a list of values in Python so that they sum up to 1.0 (making them fit a probability distribution), you can manually scale the values by dividing each element by the sum of the list. Although there isn't a direct built-in function in Python's standard library to do this, it's straightforward to implement. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef normalize(values):\n    total = sum(values)\n    return [value / total for value in values]\n\nraw = [0.07, 0.14, 0.07]\nnormed = normalize(raw)\n\nprint(normed)  # Output: [0.25, 0.5, 0.25]\n```\n\nThis function `normalize` calculates the sum of the input list and then divides each element by this sum to ensure that the new list sums to 1.0, effectively normalizing it to fit a probability distribution.\n\nIf you prefer using a library, you can use NumPy for similar functionality, which can be more efficient for larger datasets:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nraw = np.array([0.07, 0.14, 0.07])\nnormed = raw / np.sum(raw)\n\nprint(normed)  # Output: [0.25 0.5  0.25]\n```\n\nThis approach using NumPy can be particularly advantageous when dealing with larger arrays due to its optimized performance."
