        "content": "To navigate to a specific line in a text file and read it using Python, you can open the file and iterate through it line by line until you reach the desired line number. Here's an example of how you can do this to access line 34:\n\n```python\ndef read_specific_line(file_path, line_number):\n    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n        for current_line_number, line in enumerate(file, start=1):\n            if current_line_number == line_number:\n                return line.strip()  # Remove any leading/trailing whitespace\n\n# Usage\nfile_path = 'your_file.txt'\nline_number = 34\nline_content = read_specific_line(file_path, line_number)\n\nif line_content is not None:\n    print(f\"Line {line_number}: {line_content}\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Line {line_number} does not exist in the file.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Open the file**: Use `with open(file_path, 'r') as file:` to open the file in read mode, ensuring it will be closed automatically afterwards.\n- **Enumerate through the file**: Use `enumerate(file, start=1)` to iterate through each line, keeping track of the current line number starting from 1.\n- **Check the line number**: If the current line number matches the desired line number (`line_number`), return the line content.\n- **Strip whitespace**: Use `line.strip()` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace, including newline characters.\n- **Handle non-existent lines**: Check if the line content is `None` to determine if the specified line number exists in the file.\n\nThis method is efficient for reading specific lines without loading the entire file into memory."
