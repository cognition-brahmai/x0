        "content": "Based on your description of a rare Blue Morpho butterfly with unique wing patterns, it is likely that the butterfly in the image is a variant of the Morpho genus, specifically the Morpho menelaus or another closely related species. These butterflies are renowned for their strikingly vibrant blue wings, which are due to microscopic scales that reflect light. If you can provide more specific details or a clearer image, I could help narrow it down further."
