I have a string as follows:\n```python\nmystr = \"100110\"\n```\nAnd I want to convert it to a numpy array like this:\n```python\nmynumpy == np.array([1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0])\n```\nI have already tried using the following code:\n```python\nnp.fromstring(mystr, dtype=int, sep='')\n```\nHowever, I'm unable to split my string into individual digits. Numpy seems to be treating it as one number. Can anyone suggest how I can properly convert my string to a numpy array?"

        "content": "To convert a string of digits into a numpy array where each character in the string becomes an element in the array, you can use the `np.array` function along with a list comprehension. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nmystr = \"100110\"\nmynumpy = np.array([int(char) for char in mystr])\n\nprint(mynumpy)\n```\n\nThis code works by iterating over each character in the string `mystr`, converting each character to an integer, and then creating a numpy array from the list of integers. The resulting `mynumpy` array will be:\n\n```\narray([1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0])\n```\n\nThis method ensures that each character in the string is treated as a separate element in the numpy array."
