Is there a built-in function in Python for this, or do I need to implement my own? To be more specific, how can I translate this C code to Python in a more elegant way instead of just using a `while`-loop manually: \n\n```C\nfor(float x = 0; x < 10; x += 0.5f) { /* ... */ }\n```\n\nThe Python `range` function is defined as follows but it only accepts integer arguments:\n\n```python\ndef range(start, stop, step):\n  x = start\n  while True:\n    if x >= stop: return\n    yield x\n    x += step\n```"

        "content": "The Python `range` function is designed to work with integers because it is optimized for generating sequences of integer values efficiently and accurately. Floating-point arithmetic can introduce precision issues, which can lead to unexpected results when using floating-point numbers as steps in a sequence.\n\nTo achieve similar functionality to your C code snippet using a floating-point step, you can implement a custom generator function in Python. Here\u2019s a way to do it:\n\n```python\ndef frange(start, stop, step):\n    x = start\n    while x < stop:\n        yield x\n        x += step\n\n# Example usage\nfor x in frange(0, 10, 0.5):\n    print(x)\n```\n\nThis `frange` function mimics the behavior of the C for-loop you provided. It uses a generator to yield each value starting from `start`, incrementing by `step`, and stopping before `stop`.\n\nThis implementation should cover most use cases where you need a range with a floating-point step, while being simple and elegant in Python."
