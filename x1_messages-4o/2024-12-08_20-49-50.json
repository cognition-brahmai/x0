        "content": "To gather feedback from customers, you can structure your questions in different formats to cater to various data collection methods. Here's how you can set up each question according to the specified data format:\n\n1. **How did you hear about our product?**\n   - **Excel Table:** You can create an Excel table with predefined options such as \"Social Media,\" \"Word of Mouth,\" \"Online Ads,\" etc. Customers can select from a dropdown list, or you can leave it open-ended for them to type their response.\n\n2. **What was your initial impression of the product?**\n   - **Markdown:** You can create a form where customers can write their impressions in plain text or markdown format. They can use markdown syntax for emphasis, lists, and other formatting options.\n\n   ```markdown\n   # Initial Impression\n   Please describe your initial impression of the product:\n   - **Quality:**\n   - **Design:**\n   - **Functionality:**\n   ```\n\n3. **Did the product meet your expectations?**\n   - **Shell Command:** While shell commands are not typically used for feedback, you can simulate a simple interactive shell script that asks for a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer.\n\n   ```bash\n   echo \"Did the product meet your expectations? (yes/no)\"\n   read response\n   echo \"You answered: $response\"\n   ```\n\n4. **What features do you think the product is missing?**\n   - **HTML Page:** You can create an HTML form where customers can type their suggestions. Here's a simple example:\n\n   ```html\n   <form>\n     <label for=\"features\">What features do you think the product is missing?</label><br>\n     <textarea id=\"features\" name=\"features\" rows=\"4\" cols=\"50\"></textarea><br>\n     <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\">\n   </form>\n   ```\n\n5. **How likely are you to recommend our product to a friend or colleague?**\n   - **LaTeX:** Although LaTeX is not typically used for interactive feedback, you can use it to design a survey that can be printed or displayed as a PDF. Here's a basic example:\n\n   ```latex\n   \\documentclass{article}\n   \\begin{document}\n   \\section*{Recommendation Likelihood}\n   On a scale from 1 to 10, how likely are you to recommend our product to a friend or colleague?\\\\\n   \\begin{itemize}\n     \\item 1 - Not likely\n     \\item 10 - Extremely likely\n   \\end{itemize}\n   \\end{document}\n   ```\n\n6. **Is there anything else you would like to add or suggest?**\n   - **JSON Data:** You can use a JSON structure to collect additional comments. Here\u2019s how you might format the data:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"additional_feedback\": \"Your comments here\"\n   }\n   ```\n\nThese formats allow you to collect feedback in various ways, catering to different preferences and technological setups."
