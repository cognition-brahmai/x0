How can I retrieve the first non-None value from this list? If `a` is None, then I would like to get `b`. If `a` and `b` are both None, then I would like to get `d`. Currently, I am using `(((a or b) or c) or d)`. Is there a more Pythonic way to achieve this?"

This approach is cleaner and more readable:\n\n```python\nresult = next(value for value in (a, b, c, d) if value is not None)\n```\n\nThis code will iterate through the tuple `(a, b, c, d)` and return the first value that is not `None`. Using `next` with a generator expression is a common Python idiom for such tasks."
