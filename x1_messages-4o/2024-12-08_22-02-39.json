It is housed in the Louvre Museum in Paris. This masterpiece is celebrated for its sophisticated use of sfumato, a technique that allows tones and colors to shade gradually into one another, creating softened outlines and hazy forms. The Mona Lisa's enigmatic expression, which seems both alluring and aloof, has intrigued art lovers and scholars for centuries.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Historically, the Mona Lisa represents a shift in art from the medieval focus on religious iconography to the Renaissance emphasis on the individual. It reflects the period's humanistic values, showcasing a realistic portrayal of a woman with a detailed landscape background, emphasizing the beauty and complexity of the natural world.\n    </p>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis HTML document provides a list of Leonardo da Vinci's paintings, along with the historical significance and artistic style of the \"Mona Lisa.\" You can view this by copying the code into an HTML file and opening it in a web browser."
