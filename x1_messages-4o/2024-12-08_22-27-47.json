        "content": "To enhance the Ruby code to extract prepositional phrases containing adverbs that modify verbs, you need to incorporate natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. You can use the `stanford-core-nlp` gem, which interfaces with the Stanford NLP library, to parse and analyze the sentence structure. Here's an example of how you might achieve this:\n\n### Installation\n\nFirst, ensure you have the required gems installed:\n\n```bash\ngem install stanford-core-nlp\n```\n\n### Ruby Code\n\nBelow is an example Ruby script to extract nouns, verbs, adjectives, and prepositional phrases that contain adverbs modifying verbs:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'stanford-core-nlp'\n\n# Set up Stanford NLP\nStanfordCoreNLP.use :english\nStanfordCoreNLP.model_files = {}\npipeline = StanfordCoreNLP.load(:tokenize, :ssplit, :pos, :lemma, :ner, :parse, :depparse)\n\n# Method to extract information\ndef extract_information(text, pipeline)\n  # Annotate the text\n  annotation = StanfordCoreNLP::Annotation.new(text)\n  pipeline.annotate(annotation)\n\n  nouns = []\n  verbs = []\n  adjectives = []\n  prepositional_phrases = []\n\n  # Process each sentence\n  annotation.get(:sentences).each do |sentence|\n    sentence.get(:tokens).each do |token|\n      word = token.get(:original_text).to_s\n      pos = token.get(:part_of_speech).to_s\n\n      case pos\n      when /^NN/\n        nouns << word\n      when /^VB/\n        verbs << word\n      when /^JJ/\n        adjectives << word\n      end\n    end\n\n    # Parse the prepositional phrases\n    dependency_parse = sentence.get(:basic_dependencies)\n    dependency_parse.each do |dep|\n      if dep.get(:dep).to_s == \"prep\" || dep.get(:dep).to_s == \"pobj\"\n        phrase = []\n        phrase << dep.get(:governor).to_s.split(\"/\").first\n        phrase << dep.get(:dependent).to_s.split(\"/\").first\n        prepositional_phrases << phrase.join(\" \")\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\n  {\n    nouns: nouns.uniq,\n    verbs: verbs.uniq,\n    adjectives: adjectives.uniq,\n    prepositional_phrases: prepositional_phrases.uniq\n  }\nend\n\n# Example usage\ntext = \"The cat quickly jumped over the lazy dog.\"\nresult = extract_information(text, pipeline)\n\nputs \"Nouns: #{result[:nouns]}\"\nputs \"Verbs: #{result[:verbs]}\"\nputs \"Adjectives: #{result[:adjectives]}\"\nputs \"Prepositional Phrases: #{result[:prepositional_phrases]}\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Stanford NLP Setup**: The script uses Stanford NLP for parsing and POS tagging.\n2. **Token Analysis**: For each token in the sentence, it categorizes words into nouns, verbs, and adjectives based on their POS tags.\n3. **Dependency Parsing**: It checks for dependency relations to identify prepositional phrases (e.g., `prep`, `pobj`) and collects phrases where adverbs modify verbs.\n4. **Output**: It outputs the nouns, verbs, adjectives, and prepositional phrases.\n\nThis script provides a basic framework. Depending on your specific requirements, you might need to refine the dependency parsing logic further to accurately capture the desired prepositional phrases."
