Today, I attempted to create a new migration for the application using the command \"$ alembic revision -m \"__name__\"\", but was met with an error message stating \"Only a single head is supported. The script directory has multiple heads (due branching), which must be resolved by manually editing the revision files to form a linear sequence. Run `alembic branches` to see the divergence(s).\". When I ran \"alembic branches\", it returned nothing. I am relatively new to Alembic and am unsure of how to resolve this issue. Can anyone provide insight into what the problem might be and how to fix it?"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering suggests that Alembic has detected multiple heads in your migration history, which typically happens when there are diverging migration paths. This can occur if migrations have been created on separate branches and then merged without resolving the migrations into a single linear history.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check for Multiple Heads:**\n   Even though `alembic branches` returned nothing, try running `alembic heads` to see if there are any multiple heads. This command can give you a clearer picture by listing all the current heads.\n\n2. **Identify Divergence:**\n   If `alembic heads` reveals multiple heads, it's likely due to concurrent migrations being created on different branches. You need to identify where the divergence occurred. Check the timestamps and parent revisions in the migration files to determine the migration paths.\n\n3. **Merge Heads:**\n   You need to create a new \"merge revision\" to combine the multiple heads into a single linear history. Use the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   alembic merge <head1> <head2> -m \"Merge branches\"\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<head1>` and `<head2>` with the actual revision identifiers of the heads you found. This will create a new migration file that merges the two histories.\n\n4. **Resolve Conflicts:**\n   If there are any conflicts between the migrations, you'll need to manually resolve them. This might involve editing the migration scripts to ensure that the database state transitions smoothly.\n\n5. **Reapply Migrations:**\n   Once the merge revision is created, ensure that your database is up-to-date with the latest migration by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   alembic upgrade head\n   ```\n\n6. **Prevent Future Divergence:**\n   To avoid similar issues in the future, establish a workflow where migrations are created in a single, coordinated branch or ensure that any branches creating migrations are properly rebased or merged with the main migration branch.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the multiple heads issue and continue working on your application.
