        "content": "To find the union of all sets in a list using a generator expression, you can use the `set.union()` method combined with argument unpacking. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Sample list of sets\nlist_of_sets = [{1, 2, 3}, {3, 4, 5}, {5, 6, 7}]\n\n# Using a generator expression to find the union\nunion_set = set.union(*(s for s in list_of_sets))\n\nprint(union_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n```\n\nIn this example, `*(s for s in list_of_sets)` unpacks each set from the list into the `set.union()` method, which computes the union of all those sets.\n\nIf you want to create the union directly as a `frozenset`, you can wrap the union result with `frozenset()` like this:\n\n```python\n# Creating the union as a frozenset\nunion_frozenset = frozenset(set.union(*(s for s in list_of_sets)))\n\nprint(union_frozenset)  # Output: frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7})\n```\n\nThis way, you get the union of all sets as an immutable `frozenset`."
