I have come across httplib (now http.client) and similar modules which have conn.getresponse() and an HTTPResponse class, but they seem to be lacking server-side operations of conn.getrequest() and an HTTPRequest class. I have also found that BaseHTTPServer and BaseHTTPRequestHandler can perform this functionality, but these methods are not exposed for use outside of the module. Ideally, what I want is for BaseHTTPRequestHandler#parse_request to be a static method that returns an HTTPRequest object rather than populating member variables. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To achieve the functionality you're looking for, you can use a combination of existing Python modules and libraries to parse HTTP requests and responses effectively. While the standard library does provide tools for handling HTTP communication, they are not always designed for parsing HTTP requests in the way you described. Here's a way you can achieve this:\n\n### Using `http.server` Module\n\nYou can extend the `BaseHTTPRequestHandler` to parse HTTP requests and generate an `HTTPRequest` object. Although `BaseHTTPRequestHandler` is designed for handling HTTP requests in a server, you can subclass it to expose the parsing logic.\n\n### Example:\n\n```python\nfrom http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler\nfrom io import BytesIO\n\nclass HTTPRequest(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n    def __init__(self, request_text):\n        self.rfile = BytesIO(request_text)\n        self.raw_requestline = self.rfile.readline()\n        self.error_code = self.error_message = None\n        self.parse_request()\n\n    def send_response(self, code, message=None):\n        # Override to suppress output\n        pass\n\n    def send_header(self, keyword, value):\n        # Override to suppress output\n        pass\n\n    def end_headers(self):\n        # Override to suppress output\n        pass\n\n# Example usage\nrequest_text = b\"GET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: example.com\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\nrequest = HTTPRequest(request_text)\n\nprint(\"Command:\", request.command)\nprint(\"Path:\", request.path)\nprint(\"Headers:\", request.headers)\n```\n\n### How it Works:\n\n1. **BytesIO**: We use `BytesIO` to simulate a file-like object for the request text, which `BaseHTTPRequestHandler` expects.\n\n2. **Subclassing**: By subclassing `BaseHTTPRequestHandler`, we can access its parsing methods. We override methods like `send_response`, `send_header`, and `end_headers` to suppress unwanted output.\n\n3. **Usage**: You can create an instance of `HTTPRequest` with your raw HTTP request string to parse it into its components such as command, path, and headers.\n\n### Alternative: Using Third-Party Libraries\n\nThe above solution uses Python's standard library, but there are third-party libraries that can simplify this process:\n\n1. **`http-parser`**: A C-based HTTP request/response parser for Python.\n2. **`httptools`**: A Python binding for nodejs HTTP parser, which is fast and efficient.\n\nFor more robust and production-ready solutions, consider using these libraries as they offer better performance and are specifically designed for parsing HTTP messages. Here's a quick example using `httptools`:\n\n```bash\npip install httptools\n```\n\n```python\nfrom httptools import parse_url\n\nurl = parse_url(b'http://example.com/path?query=value')\nprint(\"Schema:\", url.schema)\nprint(\"Host:\", url.host)\nprint(\"Path:\", url.path)\n```\n\nThese libraries provide more advanced and efficient ways to handle HTTP parsing, especially if performance is a concern."
