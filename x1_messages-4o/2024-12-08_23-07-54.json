Can you provide a sample code that can extract and compare pricing data from different sources and present it in a clear and organized manner? [Scala code]\nI need to ensure that the code is scalable and can handle large amounts of data, and also includes error handling to avoid any issues during the data extraction and comparison process. Thank you."

        "content": "Performing a comprehensive price comparison using Scala involves several steps, including data extraction from various sources, processing the data, and then comparing the prices. This task will typically require web scraping if you want to gather data from websites or using APIs if available. Here, I'll provide a simplified example to give you an idea of how you might structure such a program using Scala.\n\nFor web scraping, you can use libraries like `Jsoup`. If the data is available through APIs, you can use Scala's HTTP libraries like `Akka HTTP` or `sttp`. Since dealing with real-world data can be complex due to the variability of data formats and sources, this example will be simplified.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. **Scala**: Make sure you have Scala installed.\n2. **Libraries**: Add the necessary libraries to your build tool (e.g., SBT).\n\n### Sample Code\n\n```scala\nimport scala.util.{Failure, Success, Try}\nimport scala.collection.mutable\nimport org.jsoup.Jsoup\nimport scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future}\nimport ExecutionContext.Implicits.global\n\n// Case class to hold product information\ncase class Product(name: String, price: Double, store: String)\n\n// Function to extract product data from a webpage\ndef extractProductData(url: String): Future[List[Product]] = Future {\n  val doc = Jsoup.connect(url).get()\n  val products = mutable.ListBuffer[Product]()\n\n  // Modify the CSS selectors based on the website structure\n  val items = doc.select(\".product-item\")\n  items.forEach { item =>\n    val name = item.select(\".product-name\").text()\n    val priceText = item.select(\".product-price\").text().replace(\"$\", \"\")\n    val price = Try(priceText.toDouble) match {\n      case Success(value) => value\n      case Failure(_) => 0.0 // Handle parsing errors\n    }\n    val store = \"Example Store\"\n    products += Product(name, price, store)\n  }\n  products.toList\n}\n\n// Function to compare products and organize them\ndef compareProducts(productLists: List[List[Product]]): List[Product] = {\n  productLists.flatten.groupBy(_.name).map { case (name, products) =>\n    products.minBy(_.price)\n  }.toList\n}\n\n// Main function\ndef main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\n  val urls = List(\n    \"https://example.com/store1/drinks\",\n    \"https://example.com/store2/drinks\"\n  )\n\n  val futureProducts = Future.sequence(urls.map(extractProductData))\n  futureProducts.onComplete {\n    case Success(productLists) =>\n      val bestDeals = compareProducts(productLists)\n      bestDeals.foreach { product =>\n        println(s\"${product.name} - ${product.price} at ${product.store}\")\n      }\n    case Failure(exception) =>\n      println(s\"Failed to extract product data: ${exception.getMessage}\")\n  }\n\n  // Keep the application running to wait for the async operations\n  Thread.sleep(10000)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Libraries**: The code uses `Jsoup` for web scraping and Scala's `Future` for asynchronous operations.\n- **Error Handling**: The code includes basic error handling for price parsing and data extraction.\n- **Scalability**: The use of `Future` allows the program to handle multiple URLs concurrently.\n- **Comparison**: The `compareProducts` function consolidates and finds the minimum price for each product across different sources.\n\n### Notes\n\n- **Selectors**: You need to adjust CSS selectors (`.product-item`, `.product-name`, `.product-price`) based on the actual HTML structure of the websites you are targeting.\n- **Blocking**: This example uses `Thread.sleep` to keep the application running for simplicity. In a real-world application, you would use a more robust method to ensure all asynchronous operations complete before the application exits.\n- **APIs**: If the stores provide APIs, it would be more efficient and reliable to use them instead of web scraping.\n\nRemember to handle legal and ethical considerations when scraping websites, and always check their terms of service."
