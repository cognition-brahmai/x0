The error message I receive is: \"Connection error: ('Unable to connect to any servers', {'127.0.0.1': ProtocolError(\"cql_version '3.3.0' is not supported by remote (w/ native protocol). Supported versions: [u'3.2.0']\",)})\". This is happening while running Python version 2.7.10 and Cassandra version 2.2.1. I also noticed that in order to start the Cassandra server, I need to run \"Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted\" on PowerShell or it wouldn't work. What could be the problem and how can I resolve the issue?"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering suggests a version mismatch between the CQL version that `cqlsh` is attempting to use and the versions supported by your Cassandra server. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Cassandra and cqlsh Versions:**\n   - Ensure that the version of `cqlsh` you are using is compatible with the version of Cassandra you have installed. `cqlsh` is usually bundled with Cassandra, so using the `cqlsh` that comes with your Cassandra installation should work seamlessly.\n\n2. **Downgrade cqlsh Version:**\n   - If you are using a standalone version of `cqlsh` that's not matching with your Cassandra version, consider using the `cqlsh` bundled with Cassandra 2.2.1. This can be found in the `bin` directory of your Cassandra installation.\n\n3. **Modify cqlsh.py:**\n   - Another workaround is to manually edit the `cqlsh.py` file to change the CQL version. Look for a line like `CQL_VERSION = '3.3.0'` and change it to `CQL_VERSION = '3.2.0'`. This should match the version supported by your Cassandra server.\n\n4. **Upgrade Cassandra:**\n   - If possible, consider upgrading your Cassandra instance to a version that supports CQL version 3.3.0 or later.\n\n5. **Check Python Environment:**\n   - Ensure that the Python environment is correctly set up, and there are no conflicting Python installations that might be causing issues with `cqlsh`.\n\n6. **PowerShell Execution Policy:**\n   - The need to execute `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted` is related to PowerShell's security settings and should not directly affect Cassandra's operation. However, it's always best to revert it back to its default setting (`Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted`) after starting Cassandra to maintain security.\n\nBy following the above steps, you should be able to resolve the connection error and get `cqlsh` working with your Cassandra setup."
