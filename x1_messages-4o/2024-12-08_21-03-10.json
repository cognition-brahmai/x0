        "content": "Certainly! The code you've provided is a good starting point. It checks the last character of a sentence to determine if it's an interrogative sentence (e.g., ending with \"?\"). However, it doesn't account for other punctuation or more complex sentence structures that could potentially be interrogative. Let's refine it slightly to handle some additional cases, although the basic logic remains quite similar:\n\n```php\n<?php\nfunction sentenceType($sentence) {\n    // Trim the sentence to remove any trailing spaces\n    $sentence = trim($sentence);\n    \n    // Check if the last character is a question mark\n    $lastChar = substr($sentence, -1);\n    \n    // Simple check for interrogative sentence\n    if ($lastChar == \"?\") {\n        echo \"The sentence is an interrogative sentence.\";\n    } else {\n        echo \"The sentence is a declarative sentence.\";\n    }\n    \n    // Additional checks can be added here for more complex logic\n    // if needed, such as looking for specific question words.\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nsentenceType(\"How many stars are in the Milky Way?\");\nsentenceType(\"The Earth orbits the Sun.\");\n?>\n```\n\nThis function is fairly straightforward and checks only the last character to determine the type of sentence. You could expand this function to handle more complex scenarios, such as identifying sentences that start with question words (e.g., \"what,\" \"how,\" \"why\") for a more robust classification. However, that would require a more detailed analysis of the sentence structure, which can be more complex to implement in PHP without additional language processing capabilities."
