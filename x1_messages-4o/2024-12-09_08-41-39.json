The base directory ends with 'codebase', like so: \n\n```\n/project_codebase\n    /project\n        __init.py\n        settings.py\n        urls.py\n        wsgi.py\n        ...    \n    /app1\n        ...\n    /app2\n        ...\n    manage.py\n```\n\nIn my settings.py, I have included both apps:\n\n```\nINSTALLED_APPS = [\n    ...\n\n    'app1',\n    'app2',\n]\n```\n\nIn my models.py from app2, I can easily import models from app1 with the command `from app1.models import *`. However, when I try to use `from app2.models import *` in my models.py from app1, I encounter an ImportError. What might be causing this issue and how can I solve it?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is most likely due to circular imports. When you try to import models from `app2` into `app1` while simultaneously importing models from `app1` into `app2`, Python gets stuck in a loop trying to resolve the imports, which results in an `ImportError`. Here are a few strategies you can use to resolve this:\n\n1. **Reorganize Imports to Avoid Circular Dependencies**: \n   - Ensure that your imports are placed in a way that does not cause a direct circular dependency. You might need to rethink the design of your models to split the logic or use different files.\n\n2. **Use ForeignKey or OneToOneField as Strings**:\n   - Instead of importing the model class directly, you can reference models in relationships as strings. For example:\n     ```python\n     class ModelInApp1(models.Model):\n         related_model = models.ForeignKey('app2.ModelInApp2', on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n     ```\n   - This allows Django to resolve the model reference at runtime, avoiding the need for direct imports.\n\n3. **Lazy Loading with `get_model`**:\n   - Use Django's `apps.get_model()` to retrieve models dynamically when needed, which can help avoid circular dependency issues.\n     ```python\n     from django.apps import apps\n     \n     ModelInApp2 = apps.get_model('app2', 'ModelInApp2')\n     ```\n\n4. **Move Shared Logic to a Common App or Module**:\n   - If `app1` and `app2` share logic or models, consider creating a third app or a separate module where shared models and logic can reside to avoid direct circular dependencies between `app1` and `app2`.\n\n5. **Check for Import Timing**:\n   - Make sure that the imports are not occurring at the module level if they can be delayed until they are actually needed (e.g., within a function or method).\n\nBy applying these strategies, you should be able to resolve the circular import issue and successfully import models between your Django apps."
