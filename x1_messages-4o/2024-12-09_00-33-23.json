        "content": "You can achieve this by iterating through the list and splitting it whenever you encounter an empty string. One way to do this is by using a loop to build sublists and appending them to a result list. Here's a sample code to demonstrate how you can split the list `l` into sublists:\n\n```python\nl = [\"data\", \"more data\", \"\", \"data 2\", \"more data 2\", \"danger\", \"\", \"date3\", \"lll\"]\n\ndef split_list_at_empty_string(lst):\n    result = []\n    sublist = []\n    \n    for item in lst:\n        if item == \"\":\n            if sublist:  # If sublist is not empty, append it to the result\n                result.append(sublist)\n                sublist = []  # Reset the sublist for the next group\n        else:\n            sublist.append(item)  # Add item to the current sublist\n    \n    if sublist:  # Append the last sublist if it's not empty\n        result.append(sublist)\n    \n    return result\n\nsublists = split_list_at_empty_string(l)\nprint(sublists)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `split_list_at_empty_string` that processes the list `l` and splits it into sublists at each occurrence of an empty string. The result for the provided list will be:\n\n```python\n[['data', 'more data'], ['data 2', 'more data 2', 'danger'], ['date3', 'lll']]\n```"
