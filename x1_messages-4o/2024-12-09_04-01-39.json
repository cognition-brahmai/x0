The timeout I have set works for the urlopen() call, but it does not seem to apply to the res.read() call where I want to read the response data. This causes the read call to hang indefinitely, waiting for data from the server. I've tried using a signal to interrupt the read() but this is not suitable as I'm using threads. I've looked into httplib2 and requests libraries, but they seem to have the same issue. Writing my own nonblocking network code using the socket module seems unnecessary as I believe there should already be a library for this. Are there any other options or is there a HTTP library for Python that handles read timeouts? As an example, you can see that setting the socket or urlopen timeout has no effect when downloading a large file, such as an Ubuntu 12.04.3 desktop ISO from LinuxQuestions.org. At least on Windows with Python 2.7.3, the timeouts are being completely ignored."

        "content": "When dealing with read timeouts in Python, especially when using libraries such as `urllib2`, `httplib2`, or `requests`, it's important to note that the timeout parameter often only applies to the connection phase, not the reading phase. That means if a connection is established successfully but the server takes too long to send the data, the read operation might hang indefinitely.\n\nHere are some options and suggestions to handle read timeouts effectively:\n\n1. **Use the `requests` library with a timeout tuple:**\n   The `requests` library allows you to specify a tuple for the `timeout` parameter, where the first value is the connection timeout and the second value is the read timeout.\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n\n   try:\n       response = requests.get('http://example.com', timeout=(5, 10))  # 5 seconds for connection, 10 seconds for read\n       response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for HTTP errors\n       data = response.content\n   except requests.exceptions.Timeout:\n       print(\"The request timed out\")\n   except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n       print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Custom Timeout Handling with `socket`:**\n   If you prefer using `urllib2`, you can manually set the socket timeout which affects both connection and read operations. However, this affects the entire Python environment, which may not be desirable in a multi-threaded application.\n\n   ```python\n   import socket\n   import urllib2\n\n   socket.setdefaulttimeout(10)\n   \n   try:\n       response = urllib2.urlopen('http://example.com')\n       data = response.read()\n   except urllib2.URLError as e:\n       print(f\"URL Error: {e.reason}\")\n   except socket.timeout:\n       print(\"Socket timeout\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Using `http.client` in Python 3:**\n   If you can upgrade to Python 3, the `http.client` module provides more control over timeouts.\n\n   ```python\n   import http.client\n\n   conn = http.client.HTTPConnection(\"example.com\", timeout=10)\n   conn.request(\"GET\", \"/\")\n   response = conn.getresponse()\n   data = response.read()\n   ```\n\n4. **Consider using `aiohttp` for Asynchronous Requests:**\n   If you are open to using asynchronous code, `aiohttp` provides good control over timeouts and is designed for concurrent requests.\n\n   ```python\n   import aiohttp\n   import asyncio\n\n   async def fetch(url):\n       timeout = aiohttp.ClientTimeout(total=10)\n       async with aiohttp.ClientSession(timeout=timeout) as session:\n           async with session.get(url) as response:\n               return await response.text()\n\n   asyncio.run(fetch('http://example.com'))\n   ```\n\nBy using these methods, you can better handle read timeouts and ensure your application behaves as expected even when server response times are long."
