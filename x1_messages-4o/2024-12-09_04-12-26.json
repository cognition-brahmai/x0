Here is my code:\n\n```python\nblank_fn = lambda *args, **kwargs: None\n\ndef callback(x, y, z=''):\n    print x, y, z\n\ndef perform_task(callback=blank_fn):\n    print 'doing stuff'\n    callback('x', 'y', z='z' )\n```\nThe motivation for doing it this way is I don't have to put in logic to check if the callback has been assigned because it defaults to `blank_fn` which just does nothing. This works, but is there some reason I shouldn't do it? Is it pythonic? Is there a better way to do it? Is there a built-in for `lambda *args, **kwargs: None`?"

        "content": "Your approach of using a blank lambda function as a default argument for a callback is a common and acceptable practice in Python. It's a neat way to avoid having to check if a callback function has been provided. However, there are a few considerations and alternatives you might want to think about:\n\n1. **Readability**: While the use of a blank lambda function is concise, it might not be immediately clear to everyone what it does, especially for someone who is not familiar with this idiom. Using a named function instead of a lambda can enhance readability.\n\n2. **Documentation**: If you expect other people to use your function or if you plan to maintain it in the long term, it may be beneficial to document the purpose of the default callback to make it clear that it does nothing by default.\n\n3. **Using named functions**: You can define a named no-op function instead of using a lambda:\n\n   ```python\n   def noop(*args, **kwargs):\n       pass\n\n   def perform_task(callback=noop):\n       print('doing stuff')\n       callback('x', 'y', z='z')\n   ```\n\n   This approach can improve readability and make it easier to add logging or debugging later if needed.\n\n4. **Built-in alternatives**: There isn't a built-in specifically for `lambda *args, **kwargs: None`, but using the `pass` statement within a function definition serves the same purpose.\n\n5. **Callable default**: Using `None` as the default and checking for it can sometimes be more explicit and clear:\n\n   ```python\n   def perform_task(callback=None):\n       if callback is None:\n           callback = noop\n       print('doing stuff')\n       callback('x', 'y', z='z')\n   ```\n\n   This approach makes it explicit that the default value is `None` until a function is assigned, and then uses the `noop` function as a fallback.\n\nOverall, your approach is perfectly valid and can be considered Pythonic, especially if you emphasize readability and maintainability through comments and documentation. If these considerations are addressed, using a blank lambda function as a default argument is a reasonable choice."
