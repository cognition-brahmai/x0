Additionally, can you provide a Python implementation that can handle both real and imaginary parts separately while maintaining the sorting order?\nFor example, given the list: [(3+4j), (1+2j), (0+1j), (-5+3j), (2-1j)], the expected output would be: [(0+1j), (2-1j), (1+2j), (3+4j), (-5+3j)].\nOne possible implementation is:\nimport math\ndef sort_complex_numbers(lst):\n    # Sort by absolute value\n    lst.sort(key=abs)\n    \n    # Split into real and imaginary parts\n    real_parts = [num.real for num in lst]\n    imag_parts = [num.imag for num in lst]\n    \n    # Sort real and imaginary parts separately while maintaining order\n    real_parts_sorted = sorted(real_parts)\n    imag_parts_sorted = [imag_parts[i] for i in sorted(range(len(imag_parts)), key=lambda k: real_parts.index(real_parts_sorted[k]))]\n    \n    # Combine real and imaginary parts\n    sorted_lst = [complex(real_parts_sorted[i], imag_parts_sorted[i]) for i in range(len(lst))]\n    \n    return sorted_lst\n# Example usage\nlst = [(3+4j), (1+2j), (0+1j), (-5+3j), (2-1j)]\nsorted_lst = sort_complex_numbers(lst)\nprint(sorted_lst) # [(0+1j), (2-1j), (1+2j), (3+4j), (-5+3j)]"

        "content": "To sort a list of complex numbers based on their absolute values, Python's built-in `sort()` method works efficiently. This method uses Timsort, which has an average and worst-case time complexity of \\(O(n \\log n)\\). This makes it very efficient compared to other sorting algorithms like bubble sort or selection sort, which have a time complexity of \\(O(n^2)\\).\n\nFor your requirement of sorting complex numbers by their absolute value and then handling both real and imaginary parts separately, here's an improved implementation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef sort_complex_numbers(lst):\n    # Sort by absolute value\n    lst.sort(key=abs)\n\n    # Split into real and imaginary parts\n    real_parts = [num.real for num in lst]\n    imag_parts = [num.imag for num in lst]\n\n    # Sort real parts; use indices to sort imag parts accordingly\n    sorted_indices = sorted(range(len(real_parts)), key=lambda i: (real_parts[i], imag_parts[i]))\n    real_parts_sorted = [real_parts[i] for i in sorted_indices]\n    imag_parts_sorted = [imag_parts[i] for i in sorted_indices]\n\n    # Combine real and imaginary parts\n    sorted_lst = [complex(real_parts_sorted[i], imag_parts_sorted[i]) for i in range(len(lst))]\n\n    return sorted_lst\n\n# Example usage\nlst = [(3+4j), (1+2j), (0+1j), (-5+3j), (2-1j)]\nsorted_lst = sort_complex_numbers(lst)\nprint(sorted_lst)  # [(0+1j), (2-1j), (1+2j), (3+4j), (-5+3j)]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Sorting by Absolute Value**: The initial sort is performed based on the absolute value (`abs`) of the complex numbers. This is the main criteria you want for sorting the complex numbers.\n\n2. **Handling Real and Imaginary Parts**: After sorting by absolute value, the real and imaginary parts are extracted and sorted separately. The sorting of real parts is done while maintaining the relative order of the imaginary parts using indices.\n\n3. **Combining Sorted Parts**: Finally, you combine the sorted real and imaginary parts to reconstruct the list of complex numbers.\n\nThis method efficiently sorts the complex numbers by their absolute values and maintains a consistent order when handling both real and imaginary parts."
