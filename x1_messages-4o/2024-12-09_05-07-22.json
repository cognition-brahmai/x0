I am facing an error message which states: \"unsupported Microsoft Visual Studio version! Only the versions 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2017 are supported!\" The error is located in the file c:\\program files\\nvidia gpu computing\\toolkit\\cuda\\v9.0\\include\\crt\\host_config.h at line 133. I've updated my VS2017 using VS installer and installed CUDA SDK 10.0.15063.0. My Visual Studio version is 15.5.0 and my nvcc version is release 9.0, V9.0.176. I tried to change host_config.h line 133 to `#if _MSC_VER < 1600 || _MSC_VER > 1912` but this only resulted in a series of \"expression must have a constant value\" errors in the file type_trails. How can I solve this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is due to a mismatch between the CUDA Toolkit and the version of Visual Studio you are using. CUDA 9.0 was released before Visual Studio 2017 version 15.5, and the CUDA Toolkit does not officially support this newer version of Visual Studio. Here are some possible solutions to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Update CUDA Toolkit**: Check if a newer version of the CUDA Toolkit is available that supports Visual Studio 2017 version 15.5 or later. Since you mentioned using CUDA 9.0, consider upgrading to a newer version like CUDA 10.x or later if available, as they may have better support for newer Visual Studio versions.\n\n2. **Revert Visual Studio Update**: If updating CUDA is not an option, consider reverting your Visual Studio to a version that is known to be compatible with CUDA 9.0. This might involve uninstalling the current version and reinstalling an older version like 15.4 or earlier.\n\n3. **Modify CUDA Files (Temporary Workaround)**:\n   - If you decide to manually modify the files, be cautious as this might lead to other issues. Instead of modifying `host_config.h`, you can try setting up a custom property sheet in your Visual Studio project to define `_MSC_VER` to a supported value temporarily. However, this is not recommended for production code.\n   - Alternatively, you might look into community patches or forums where others have shared their modifications to support newer Visual Studio versions.\n\n4. **Check for Patches or Community Solutions**: Sometimes, developers in the community create patches or workarounds for these issues. Check forums like Stack Overflow or NVIDIA Developer Forums to see if anyone else has found a solution.\n\n5. **Contact NVIDIA Support**: If possible, reach out to NVIDIA support for guidance. They may have more up-to-date solutions or recommendations for your specific setup.\n\nBy taking these steps, you should be able to resolve the compatibility issue and successfully build your CUDA projects in Visual Studio."
