A palindrome is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. First, let's calculate the sum of these numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{Sum} = 170 + 210 + 190 + 180 + 200 = 950 \\]\n\nNow, we need to check if 950 is a palindrome. A number is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. For 950:\n\n- Reversed: 059 (which is 59)\n\nSince 950 is not a palindrome, we cannot make it a palindrome by just adding these numbers in sequence. If the task was to adjust the sum to make it a palindrome, we could have explored other approaches, but given the constraints (using each number exactly once and in the given order), it's clear that the sum, 950, is not a palindrome.\n\nHowever, we can write a Go program to check this:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"strconv\"\n)\n\n// Function to check if a number is a palindrome\nfunc isPalindrome(number int) bool {\n\tstr := strconv.Itoa(number)\n\tfor i, j := 0, len(str)-1; i < j; i, j = i+1, j-1 {\n\t\tif str[i] != str[j] {\n\t\t\treturn false\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn true\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tnumbers := []int{170, 210, 190, 180, 200}\n\tsum := 0\n\tfor _, num := range numbers {\n\t\tsum += num\n\t}\n\n\tfmt.Printf(\"Sum of numbers: %d\\n\", sum)\n\tif isPalindrome(sum) {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"The sum is a palindrome.\")\n\t} else {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"The sum is not a palindrome.\")\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThis program will output that the sum is not a palindrome, confirming our manual calculation."
