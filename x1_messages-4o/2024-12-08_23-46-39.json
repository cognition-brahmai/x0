        "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) encompasses a wide range of sub-fields, each focusing on different aspects of creating intelligent systems. Here are four major sub-fields:\n\n1. **Machine Learning (ML):** This is the study of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions, by relying on patterns and inference. It includes supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.\n\n2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** This sub-field focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The goal is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human language in a useful way. Applications include language translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbots.\n\n3. **Computer Vision:** This area involves enabling computers to interpret and make decisions based on visual data, such as images or videos. It includes tasks like object detection, image recognition, and video analysis.\n\n4. **Robotics:** Robotics involves the design, construction, operation, and use of robots. In AI, it includes creating algorithms that allow robots to perceive their environment, make decisions, and perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously.\n\nThese sub-fields often overlap and interact, contributing to advancements in AI as a whole."
