I am modifying a pre-trained model for different tasks and want to speed up the training for newly added layers while keeping the learning rate low for the trained layers to prevent distortion. For instance, in a pre-trained model with 5 convolutional layers, if I add a new convolutional layer and fine tune it, how can I set a learning rate of 0.00001 for the first 5 layers and 0.001 for the last one, similar to what can be done in Caffe?"

        "content": "To set different learning rates for different layers in TensorFlow, you can use the `tf.keras` API to create custom training loops or use the `tf.keras.optimizers.Optimizer` class to apply different learning rates to different parts of the model. Here's one approach using custom training loops:\n\n1. **Separate the Layers**: First, separate the layers you want to apply different learning rates to.\n\n2. **Create Optimizers**: Create different optimizers for each set of layers with their respective learning rates.\n\n3. **Custom Training Loop**: Implement a custom training loop where you manually apply gradients using the specific optimizer for each set of layers.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assume `model` is your pre-trained model.\n# Let's say `new_layer` is the additional layer you've added.\nnew_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', name='new_conv_layer')\n\n# Add the new layer to the model\nmodel = tf.keras.Sequential([\n    *model.layers,  # existing layers\n    new_layer       # new layer\n])\n\n# Divide the model into two parts: pretrained and new layers\npretrained_layers = model.layers[:-1]  # All layers except the last one\nnew_layers = [model.layers[-1]]        # Only the last layer\n\n# Define two optimizers with different learning rates\noptimizer_pretrained = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.00001)\noptimizer_new = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)\n\n# Loss function\nloss_fn = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)\n\n# Custom training loop\n@tf.function\ndef train_step(x, y):\n    with tf.GradientTape(persistent=True) as tape:\n        logits = model(x, training=True)\n        loss = loss_fn(y, logits)\n\n    # Compute gradients\n    gradients_pretrained = tape.gradient(loss, [layer.trainable_variables for layer in pretrained_layers])\n    gradients_new = tape.gradient(loss, [layer.trainable_variables for layer in new_layers])\n\n    # Apply gradients\n    optimizer_pretrained.apply_gradients(zip(gradients_pretrained, [layer.trainable_variables for layer in pretrained_layers]))\n    optimizer_new.apply_gradients(zip(gradients_new, [layer.trainable_variables for layer in new_layers]))\n\n    return loss\n\n# Example training loop\nfor epoch in range(epochs):\n    for batch, (x, y) in enumerate(train_dataset):\n        loss = train_step(x, y)\n        print(f'Epoch {epoch}, Batch {batch}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}')\n```\n\nThis code sets up a custom training loop where different parts of the model are updated with different optimizers, allowing you to use separate learning rates for the pre-trained and newly added layers. Adjust the `epochs` and `train_dataset` as needed for your specific application."
