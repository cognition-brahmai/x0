However, I am encountering an error `IOError: [Errno 28] No space left on device`. Upon running `df`, I see that both `/tmp` and `/var/tmp` are completely full. Is there a way to install TensorFlow without the temporary files being downloaded in either `/tmp` or `/var/tmp`?"

        "content": "When encountering the `IOError: [Errno 28] No space left on device` error during the installation of TensorFlow, it's likely because the temporary files are being stored in directories that are full. To work around this issue, you can change the location where temporary files are stored during the installation process. Here are a few approaches you can try:\n\n1. **Set a Different Temporary Directory:**\n   You can change the temporary directory used by `pip` by setting the `TMPDIR` environment variable to a location with more space. For example:\n\n   ```bash\n   export TMPDIR=/path/to/large/tmp\n   ```\n\n   Make sure `/path/to/large/tmp` is a directory with sufficient space. You can then proceed with your installation command.\n\n2. **Use a Virtual Environment:**\n   Sometimes using a virtual environment can help manage installations more efficiently. Create a virtual environment in a directory with ample space:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv /path/to/large/venv\n   source /path/to/large/venv/bin/activate\n   pip install --upgrade pip\n   pip install tensorflow==0.11.0\n   ```\n\n   This way, all the installations happen within the virtual environment and don't affect the global `/tmp` or `/var/tmp` directories.\n\n3. **Direct Wheel File Installation:**\n   If you can download the wheel file to a directory with more space, you can directly install TensorFlow from the file:\n\n   ```bash\n   wget -P /path/to/large/dir http://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.11.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl\n   pip install /path/to/large/dir/tensorflow-0.11.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl\n   ```\n\n4. **Clean Up Space:**\n   If possible, try to clean up some space in your `/tmp` or `/var/tmp` directories by removing unnecessary files. This might allow the installation to proceed without changing configurations.\n\nBy using one of these methods, you should be able to install TensorFlow without running into the space limitations of your `/tmp` or `/var/tmp` directories."
