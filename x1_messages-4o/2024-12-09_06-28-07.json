However, this splits the string into a list of individual characters `['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']` rather than creating a single element list `['hello']` as desired. What is the correct way to do this?"

This will create a list containing the entire string as a single element. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nvar_1 = \"hello\"\nsingle_element_list = [var_1]\n```\n\nAfter executing this code, `single_element_list` will be `['hello']`, which is the single element list you're aiming for."
