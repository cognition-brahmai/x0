        "content": "To report the confusion matrix instead of just accuracy, you can use a combination of cross-validation and confusion matrix computation. The `cross_val_predict` function in scikit-learn allows you to generate cross-validated estimates for each input data point, which you can then use to compute the confusion matrix.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import BernoulliNB\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_predict\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Your existing pipeline\npipeline = Pipeline([\n    ('bow', CountVectorizer()),  \n    ('classifier', BernoulliNB()), \n])\n\n# Use cross_val_predict to get predictions\npredictions = cross_val_predict(pipeline, train_set, label_train, cv=5, n_jobs=-1)\n\n# Calculate the confusion matrix\nconf_matrix = confusion_matrix(label_train, predictions)\n\nprint(\"Confusion Matrix:\")\nprint(conf_matrix)\n```\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of what this code does:\n- It uses `cross_val_predict` instead of `cross_val_score` to generate predicted labels for each fold of the cross-validation process.\n- It then computes the confusion matrix using the true labels (`label_train`) and the predicted labels (`predictions`).\n\nThis will give you the confusion matrix which provides insights into the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions made by the model."
