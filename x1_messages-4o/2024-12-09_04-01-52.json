Does the underscore indicate a \"don't care\" result, or does it serve some other purpose? When is it recommended to use \"_\" as a variable name? Is there a similar function for \"_\" in non-interactive code as in interactive mode, where it holds the answer of the previous operation?"

        "content": "In Python, the underscore (`_`) is often used as a throwaway variable, which means that the value assigned to it is not going to be used later. In the context of the line you mentioned from Peter Norvig's Sudoku solver, it's essentially serving as a \"don't care\" variable. The expression `min( (len(values[s]), s) for s in squares if len(values[s]) > 1 )` returns a tuple, but only the second element (`s`) is of interest for further operations. The underscore is used to ignore the first element of the tuple, which is `len(values[s])`.\n\nUsing an underscore in this manner is a common Python idiom when you want to acknowledge that a value is being returned, but you don't intend to use it. It helps make the code cleaner and more expressive by indicating that the specific value is irrelevant for the operation being performed.\n\nIn non-interactive code, the underscore doesn't have a special function beyond being a conventional placeholder for unused variables. However, in interactive mode (such as in the Python REPL), the underscore does have a special meaning: it holds the result of the last evaluated expression. This feature is specific to the interactive interpreter and is not applicable in scripts or non-interactive programs.\n\nIt's recommended to use `_` as a variable name when:\n\n1. You need to unpack a tuple but want to ignore certain values.\n2. You are iterating over a sequence and the loop variable itself is not used.\n3. You want to indicate that a returned value from a function or expression is intentionally being ignored.\n\nThese practices help improve code readability by signaling to other developers (or your future self) that certain values are intentionally left unused."
