        "content": "To resolve the issue and successfully install `py2exe` for Python 2.7, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Ensure Correct Version**: The error you're encountering suggests that the version of `py2exe` available on PyPI (Python Package Index) is meant for Python 3.x. However, `py2exe` does support Python 2.7, but you may need to specify the correct version or source to install from.\n\n2. **Download the Appropriate Version**: Instead of using `pip` directly, you can manually download the compatible version of `py2exe` for Python 2.7. Here's how you can do it:\n\n   a. Visit the [py2exe SourceForge page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/py2exe/files/py2exe/).\n   \n   b. Look for the version that supports Python 2.7. As of the latest updates, `py2exe` 0.6.9 is known to be compatible with Python 2.7.\n\n3. **Install Manually**: Once you've downloaded the correct wheel file or executable installer for `py2exe`, follow these steps:\n\n   a. **Using the Wheel File**: If you downloaded a `.whl` file:\n   \n   ```bash\n   pip install path\\to\\py2exe-0.6.9.win32-py2.7.exe\n   ```\n   \n   b. **Using the Executable Installer**: If you downloaded an `.exe` file for Windows:\n   \n   - Run the installer by double-clicking the file and follow the installation instructions.\n\n4. **Verify Installation**: After installation, verify that `py2exe` is correctly installed by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m py2exe\n   ```\n\n   This should not produce any import errors and should confirm that `py2exe` is available for your Python 2.7 environment.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and install `py2exe` for Python 2.7 successfully."
