        "content": "In Python, there isn't a direct equivalent to Java's `throws` keyword because Python handles exceptions differently. Java has checked and unchecked exceptions, where checked exceptions must be declared in a method's `throws` clause. Python, on the other hand, does not have checked exceptions, so there's no need for a `throws` equivalent.\n\nHowever, you can achieve similar behavior in Python by documenting the exceptions a function might raise using docstrings or decorators, though this won't enforce any compile-time checks. Here's how you might do it:\n\n### Using Docstrings\n\nYou can document the possible exceptions in the function's docstring:\n\n```python\ndef some_method():\n    \"\"\"\n    This method does something.\n\n    Raises:\n        SomeException: Description of when this exception is raised.\n    \"\"\"\n    raise SomeException(\"An error occurred\")\n```\n\n### Using Decorators\n\nWhile decorators won't enforce exception handling at static time, they can be used to handle exceptions or log them:\n\n```python\ndef exception_handler_decorator(func):\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        try:\n            return func(*args, **kwargs)\n        except SomeException as e:\n            print(f\"Handled {e}\")\n            # Handle exception or re-raise\n            raise\n    return wrapper\n\n@exception_handler_decorator\ndef some_method():\n    raise SomeException(\"An error occurred\")\n```\n\n### Chaining Exceptions\n\nPython allows exception chaining using the `from` keyword. This is useful when you want to raise a new exception while preserving the original exception context:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Code that raises an exception\n    raise KeyError(\"Original exception\")\nexcept KeyError as e:\n    raise SomeException(\"New exception\") from e\n```\n\n### Passing Exception Handling Responsibility\n\nPython allows you to pass the responsibility of handling exceptions by re-raising them or handling them at a higher level in the call stack. You can simply let the exception propagate by not catching it or by using `raise` in an except block:\n\n```python\ndef some_method():\n    try:\n        # Code that may raise an exception\n        raise SomeException(\"An error occurred\")\n    except SomeException:\n        # Optionally log or perform additional actions\n        print(\"Exception occurred, propagating\")\n        raise  # Re-raise the exception\n```\n\nIn summary, while Python doesn't have the `throws` keyword, you can document exceptions, use decorators for handling/logging, chain exceptions, and pass handling responsibility up the call stack."
