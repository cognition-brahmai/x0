I'm using them to compare tuples in a list where if any value is different, it should return True and if they are all the same, it should return False. But it's returning [False, False, False] for the following piece of code. \n\n```\nd = defaultdict(list)\nprint(d['Drd2'])\n# [[1, 5, 0], [1, 6, 0]]\nprint(list(zip(*d['Drd2'])))\n# [(1, 1), (5, 6), (0, 0)]\nprint([any(x) and not all(x) for x in zip(*d['Drd2'])])\n# [False, False, False]\n```\nTo my understanding, it should output [False, True, False] because (1, 1) are the same, (5, 6) are different, and (0, 0) are the same. Why is it evaluating to False for all tuples?"

        "content": "The `any()` and `all()` functions in Python are used to evaluate iterables:\n\n- `any(iterable)` returns `True` if at least one element of the iterable is truthy (i.e., not zero, not `None`, not `False`, etc.). It returns `False` if all elements are falsy.\n- `all(iterable)` returns `True` if all elements of the iterable are truthy. It returns `False` if any element is falsy.\n\nIn your code, you are using the expressions `any(x)` and `not all(x)` for each tuple `x` in the zipped list. Let's break down what's happening:\n\n1. **`any(x)`**: This will return `True` if at least one element in `x` is non-zero. Since all elements in the tuples `(1, 1)`, `(5, 6)`, and `(0, 0)` contain at least one truthy value, `any(x)` will return `True` for all of them.\n\n2. **`not all(x)`**: This will return `True` if not all elements in `x` are non-zero. For the tuples `(1, 1)` and `(0, 0)`, both elements are the same, so `all(x)` returns `True`, and hence `not all(x)` returns `False`. For the tuple `(5, 6)`, the elements are different, so `all(x)` returns `False`, and `not all(x)` returns `True`.\n\nThus, the expression `any(x) and not all(x)` evaluates to `True` only if the tuple `x` contains at least one non-zero element (which is true for all your tuples) and not all elements are the same (which is true only for `(5, 6)`).\n\nHere's the logic applied:\n\n- For `(1, 1)`: `any(x)` is `True`, `all(x)` is `True`, so `any(x) and not all(x)` is `False`.\n- For `(5, 6)`: `any(x)` is `True`, `all(x)` is `False`, so `any(x) and not all(x)` is `True`.\n- For `(0, 0)`: `any(x)` is `False`, `all(x)` is `False`, so `any(x) and not all(x)` is `False`.\n\nTherefore, your expected output `[False, True, False]` is correct and aligns with what you are seeing. The key understanding here is that `any(x)` is always `True` unless all elements are zero or falsy, and `not all(x)` is `True` when not all elements are the same (or truthy).\n\nIf you are getting `[False, False, False]`, please ensure that the list and tuples are structured as expected and that there are no unexpected values or types interfering with the logic."
