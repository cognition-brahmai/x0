I have tried the solution of adding a ~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc file with the code: backend: TkAgg. However, after doing that, I receive a different error related to 'UserWarning: Matplotlib is building the font cache using fc-list'. I'm not using a virtual machine. I'm able to temporarily fix it by adding 'import matplotlib' and 'matplotlib.use('TkAgg')' before importing matplotlib.pyplot, but this is not a convenient solution. How can I permanently fix this issue?"

        "content": "To address the \"Python is not installed as a framework\" issue and the subsequent font cache warning in Matplotlib, you can try the following steps to resolve these problems permanently:\n\n1. **Install Python as a Framework:**\n   On macOS, Python should be installed as a framework to work smoothly with GUI libraries like TkAgg. If you're using a Python version from the official Python website, make sure you have installed it as a framework. You can do this by downloading the macOS installer from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and following the installation instructions.\n\n2. **Update Matplotlib and its Dependencies:**\n   Make sure you have the latest version of Matplotlib and its dependencies. You can update them using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade matplotlib\n   ```\n\n3. **Configure Matplotlib Backend:**\n   If you want to set TkAgg as the default backend permanently, you can specify it in your matplotlibrc configuration file rather than setting it programmatically. To find the location of your current matplotlibrc file, you can run the following in Python:\n\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib\n   print(matplotlib.matplotlib_fname())\n   ```\n\n   Edit the file and set the backend to TkAgg:\n\n   ```plaintext\n   backend: TkAgg\n   ```\n\n4. **Clear Matplotlib's Cache:**\n   Sometimes, clearing Matplotlib's cache can resolve the font cache warning. You can do this by deleting the `.cache/matplotlib` directory in your home directory:\n\n   ```bash\n   rm -rf ~/.cache/matplotlib\n   ```\n\n5. **Install Missing Dependencies:**\n   Make sure you have all necessary dependencies installed. Sometimes the font cache warning is due to missing font configuration utilities. On macOS, you can try installing `fontconfig` using Homebrew:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew install fontconfig\n   ```\n\n6. **Rebuild the Font Cache:**\n   After installing or updating dependencies, you might need to rebuild the font cache manually:\n\n   ```bash\n   fc-cache -fv\n   ```\n\n7. **Reinstall Python and Matplotlib:**\n   If the issue persists, consider reinstalling Python and Matplotlib. Uninstall them completely and then reinstall them, ensuring Python is set up as a framework:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall matplotlib\n   brew uninstall python  # only if you installed via Homebrew\n   # Reinstall Python as a framework and Matplotlib\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the RuntimeError and font cache warnings with Matplotlib in a more permanent manner."
