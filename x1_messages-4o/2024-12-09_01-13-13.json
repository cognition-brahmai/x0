I am looking for a built-in or one-liner solution, so I don't have to copy the function around. For example, I have this function:\n\n```python\ndef first(the_iterable, condition = lambda x: True):\n    for i in the_iterable:\n        if condition(i):\n            return i\n```\n\nWhich I can use like this:\n\n```python\n>>> first(range(10))\n0\n>>> first(range(10), lambda i: i > 3)\n4\n```\n\nIs there a built-in way to achieve the same result?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this using a combination of the `next` function and a generator expression in Python. This approach allows you to find the first item that matches a condition without processing the entire iterable, and it can be done in a concise, one-liner manner. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nresult = next((i for i in the_iterable if condition(i)), None)\n```\n\nIn this one-liner:\n\n- The generator expression `(i for i in the_iterable if condition(i))` lazily evaluates each item in `the_iterable`, checking if it satisfies `condition(i)`.\n- The `next` function retrieves the first item from this generator expression that meets the condition.\n- The second argument to `next`, `None`, is the default value returned if no item satisfies the condition, preventing a `StopIteration` exception.\n\nHere's how you can use it with your examples:\n\n```python\nresult1 = next((i for i in range(10) if i > 3), None)\nprint(result1)  # Output: 4\n\nresult2 = next((i for i in range(10) if i % 2 == 0), None)\nprint(result2)  # Output: 0\n```\n\nThis approach is efficient and avoids the need to define a separate function, making it a neat solution for finding the first matching item in an iterable."
