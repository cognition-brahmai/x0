        "content": "In NumPy, there isn't a direct method like the `pop` method for lists, but you can efficiently remove the last element from a 1-dimensional array using slicing. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Example numpy array\narr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n\n# Remove the last element\narr = arr[:-1]\n\nprint(arr)\n```\n\nIn this example, `arr[:-1]` creates a new array that includes all elements of `arr` except the last one. This approach is efficient and maintains the array structure. Keep in mind that this operation does not modify the original array in place; it creates a new array without the last element."
