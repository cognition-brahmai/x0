However, when I use these methods, the HTML page I receive is completely different from what I see when I visit the website through a browser like Firefox or Chrome. I suspect the website developer has set up some blocks for non-browser visits. How can I use Python requests or 'wget' command to mimic a browser visit and get the correct content?"

        "content": "When a website displays different content for browsers compared to scripts or non-browser tools, it's often due to user-agent filtering or other mechanisms like JavaScript rendering. Here\u2019s how you can mimic a browser visit using Python's `requests` package or the `wget` command:\n\n### Using Python `requests`:\n\n1. **Set a User-Agent Header**: Websites often check the User-Agent header to determine the type of client making the request. You can set a User-Agent string in your request to mimic a browser.\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\nurl = \"http://www.ichangtou.com/#company:data_000008.html\"\n\nheaders = {\n    \"User-Agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/106.0.0.0 Safari/537.36\"\n}\n\nresponse = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n\nprint(response.text)\n```\n\n2. **Handle JavaScript**: If the content is rendered using JavaScript, you might not get the expected results with `requests` alone. In such cases, consider using a headless browser like Selenium or a tool like `requests-html` which can execute JavaScript.\n\n```python\nfrom requests_html import HTMLSession\n\nsession = HTMLSession()\n\nresponse = session.get(url)\nresponse.html.render()  # This will execute JavaScript\n\nprint(response.html.html)\n```\n\n### Using `wget`:\n\n1. **Set User-Agent in `wget`**: You can set a User-Agent string in `wget` using the `--user-agent` option.\n\n```bash\nwget --user-agent=\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/106.0.0.0 Safari/537.36\" \"http://www.ichangtou.com/#company:data_000008.html\"\n```\n\n2. **Use `wget` with other options**: If setting the User-Agent alone does not work, you might need to explore other options like `--header` to mimic additional headers that your browser sends, or use a tool that can handle JavaScript.\n\n### Notes:\n\n- **Check Network Activity**: Use the browser's Developer Tools (F12) to inspect network activity. Look at the requests your browser makes to understand headers and other parameters that might be needed.\n- **JavaScript-Heavy Sites**: If the site heavily relies on JavaScript, tools like Selenium or Puppeteer (via Pyppeteer in Python) might be necessary.\n\nRemember to check the website's terms of service to ensure that scraping is allowed."
