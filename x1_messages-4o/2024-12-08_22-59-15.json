        "content": "To solve this physics puzzle, we need to derive the equations of motion for a spherical object thrown vertically upward, considering both gravitational force and air resistance. The trajectory of the object will be influenced by these forces, resulting in a path that is generally a parabola in the absence of air resistance, but more complex with air resistance.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Parameters**:\n   - Mass of the object: \\( m \\)\n   - Initial velocity: \\( v_0 \\)\n   - Launch angle: \\( \\theta \\) (for vertical throw, \\( \\theta = 90^\\circ \\))\n   - Gravitational acceleration: \\( g \\approx 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\)\n   - Air resistance: Generally modeled as \\( F_d = \\frac{1}{2} C_d \\rho A v^2 \\), where \\( C_d \\) is the drag coefficient, \\( \\rho \\) is the air density, and \\( A \\) is the cross-sectional area.\n\n2. **Forces Involved**:\n   - **Gravitational Force**: \\( F_g = mg \\)\n   - **Air Resistance**: Assumed to be proportional to the velocity squared for high speeds, \\( F_d = kv^2 \\), where \\( k = \\frac{1}{2} C_d \\rho A \\).\n\n3. **Equations of Motion**:\n   - The net force acting on the object is \\( F = -mg - kv^2 \\) (negative sign indicates opposite to the direction of motion).\n   - Using Newton's second law, \\( F = ma \\), we get the differential equation:\n     \\[\n     ma = -mg - kv^2\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we have:\n     \\[\n     a = -g - \\frac{k}{m}v^2\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solving the Differential Equation**:\n   - This is a separable differential equation. Rearrange and integrate:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{dv}{dt} = -g - \\frac{k}{m}v^2\n     \\]\n   - Integrate with respect to time \\( t \\) to find \\( v(t) \\) and then integrate \\( v(t) \\) to find \\( y(t) \\).\n\n5. **Integration and Trajectory**:\n   - Solving the integration will typically require numerical methods or approximations, especially if \\( v^2 \\) is significant (non-linear drag). The exact solution involves hyperbolic functions and can be complex.\n   - The trajectory equation in the vertical direction (y-axis) can be approximated and corrected iteratively for air resistance.\n\n6. **Vertical Motion**: \n   - Without air resistance, the maximum height \\( h \\) reached by a projectile launched straight up is given by:\n     \\[\n     h = \\frac{v_0^2}{2g}\n     \\]\n   - With air resistance, the height will be less and needs numerical simulation for precise values.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The trajectory of the object, considering air resistance, is complex and typically requires computational tools to solve accurately. In practical scenarios, simulation software or iterative numerical methods are used to predict the path.\n\nIn summary, while the basic physics principles are straightforward, the presence of air resistance complicates the trajectory, requiring numerical solutions for precise predictions."
