The code I am using is as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom pytz import timezone\ntimezone('America/Chicago')\n```\n\nThe output I get is:\n\n```python\n<DstTzInfo 'America/Chicago' LMT-1 day, 18:09:00 STD>\n```\n\nI was expecting:\n\n```python\n<DstTzInfo 'America/Chicago' LMT-1 day, 18:00:00 STD>\n```\n\nI don't think my timezone should be 6 hours and 9 minutes away from UTC. Other values passed to the `timezone()` function seem to work fine. Also, the function returns the correct timezone info on my co-worker's machine. I am running version `2015.7` of `pytz` installed using `pip`. Could anyone help me understand why the timezone for 'America/Chicago' would be off by 9 minutes?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing with the `pytz` package and the 'America/Chicago' timezone returning an unexpected offset of 9 minutes (LMT-1 day, 18:09:00 STD) is likely because of how historical timezones are handled by `pytz`.\n\nThe offset you're seeing, LMT (Local Mean Time), is a historical timezone offset that was used before the adoption of standard timezones. This offset is specific to the historical data provided by the IANA Time Zone Database, which `pytz` uses. The 9-minute offset is part of the historical data for Chicago prior to the standardization of the Central Time Zone (CST), which is UTC-6.\n\nHere are a few things to check and consider:\n\n1. **Current Timezone Data:**\n   Ensure that you have the latest version of the timezone database. Running `pip install --upgrade pytz` will ensure you have the most recent version of `pytz`.\n\n2. **Use Current Date and Time:**\n   If you want to get the current timezone offset for 'America/Chicago', you should create a timezone-aware datetime object using the current date and time. This will give you the current offset, accounting for daylight saving time if applicable:\n\n   ```python\n   from datetime import datetime\n   from pytz import timezone\n\n   chicago_tz = timezone('America/Chicago')\n   chicago_time = datetime.now(chicago_tz)\n   print(chicago_time)\n   ```\n\n3. **Understanding Historical Context:**\n   If you're specifically working with historical dates, you might encounter these LMT offsets. This is expected behavior when dealing with older dates before standard timezones were universally adopted. For current or recent dates, you should not see this 9-minute offset.\n\nBy using the current date and time, you should see the correct offset for the 'America/Chicago' timezone, typically CST (UTC-6) or CDT (UTC-5) if daylight saving time is in effect."
