I attempted to create one with the following code:\n\n```python\ncells = numpy.array([[0,1,2,3], [2,3,4]])\n```\n\nHowever, I encountered a ValueError with the message \"setting an array element with a sequence\". How can I solve this issue?"

        "content": "In NumPy, a standard multidimensional array requires that all rows (or dimensions) have the same size. If you want to create an array with varying row sizes, you can make use of an array of objects, which essentially allows you to have an array of lists or arrays with different sizes. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Creating an array of objects\ncells = np.array([np.array([0, 1, 2, 3]), np.array([2, 3, 4])], dtype=object)\n\nprint(cells)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We specify `dtype=object` to tell NumPy that the elements are objects (in this case, arrays of varying sizes).\n- Each element is a separate NumPy array, and they can have different sizes.\n\nThis allows you to effectively manage collections of arrays with different lengths within a single array-like structure. Keep in mind that this approach may not benefit from the same optimizations and features as standard NumPy arrays with uniform sizes, but it provides the flexibility you need for handling varying row sizes."
