However, here's a general example of how you might create and fill a 2D array with values from 0 to (rows*columns-1) using Python, keeping it as minimal as possible:\n\n```python\ndef create_2d_array(rows, columns):\n    return [[j + i * columns for j in range(columns)] for i in range(rows)]\n\n# Example usage:\nrows, columns = 3, 4\narray_2d = create_2d_array(rows, columns)\nfor row in array_2d:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code uses a list comprehension to create a 2D array. The outer list comprehension iterates over the number of rows, and the inner one iterates over the number of columns, filling each cell with the appropriate value. You can replace the `rows` and `columns` with your desired dimensions. If you'd like to see your specific code refactored, please share it here!"
