I have written a python script for this task, but I am facing an issue. The script throws an error saying \"invalid data stream\". Here is the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport os\nimport bz2\nfrom bz2 import decompress\n\npath = \"Dir\"\nfor(dirpath,dirnames,files)in os.walk(path):\n   for file in files:\n       filepath = os.path.join(dirpath,filename)\n       newfile = bz2.decompress(file)\n       newfilepath = os.path.join(dirpath,newfile)\n```\nCan you help me identify the issue and correct it?"

        "content": "Certainly! There are a few issues in your script that need to be addressed to properly decompress `.bz2` files:\n\n1. **Invalid Variable Name**: You use `filename` in `os.path.join(dirpath, filename)` but you should be using `file`, which is the variable you defined in your loop.\n\n2. **Reading the File**: You need to open the file and read its contents before decompressing it. `bz2.decompress()` expects bytes, not file names.\n\n3. **Writing the Decompressed File**: After decompressing, you need to write the decompressed data to a new file.\n\nHere's a corrected version of your script:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport bz2\n\npath = \"Dir\"\nfor (dirpath, dirnames, files) in os.walk(path):\n    for file in files:\n        if file.endswith('.bz2'):  # Ensure we're only trying to decompress .bz2 files\n            filepath = os.path.join(dirpath, file)\n            with open(filepath, 'rb') as f:  # Open the file in binary mode\n                file_content = f.read()\n                try:\n                    decompressed_data = bz2.decompress(file_content)\n                except OSError as e:\n                    print(f\"Error decompressing {filepath}: {e}\")\n                    continue\n\n            # Save the decompressed data to a new file without the .bz2 extension\n            newfile = file[:-4]  # Remove the .bz2 extension\n            newfilepath = os.path.join(dirpath, newfile)\n            with open(newfilepath, 'wb') as f:\n                f.write(decompressed_data)\n            print(f\"Decompressed {file} to {newfile}\")\n```\n\n### Key Adjustments:\n- Open the `.bz2` file in binary mode using `open(filepath, 'rb')`.\n- Ensure the file ends with `.bz2` before attempting to decompress.\n- Use `bz2.decompress(file_content)` to decompress the byte data.\n- Write the decompressed data to a new file, removing the `.bz2` extension.\n- Handle `OSError` exceptions which might occur if the bz2 file is corrupted or not valid.\n\nThis should resolve the issue and allow you to decompress `.bz2` files in any directory structure starting from the specified root path."
