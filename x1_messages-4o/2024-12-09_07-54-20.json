I want to use the same logger that Spark is using so that the log messages come out in the same format and the level is controlled by the same configuration files. However, when I add the logging statements like `logging.info(\"This is an informative message.\")` and `logging.debug(\"This is a debug message.\")` to the code or try to start out with a `logging.getLogger()`, I only see Spark's log messages but not mine. Is this issue specific to scripts submitted to Spark or is it my misunderstanding of how logging works? How can I effectively log from my Python Spark script?"

        "content": "When you're running a Python script with Spark, especially with `spark-submit`, logging can be a bit tricky due to how Spark and Python handle logging differently. Here's how you can integrate your logging with Spark's logging system:\n\n1. **Use the Py4j Gateway Logger:**\n   Spark uses a Java-based logging framework, and when using PySpark, the Python code runs on the executor side. To ensure that your logging messages are consistent with Spark's logs, you need to set up logging in your Python code to use the same configuration.\n\n2. **Configure Python Logging:**\n   You can configure Python's logging to match Spark's configuration. Spark uses log4j, so you'll want to configure Python's logging to output in a similar format. Here's an example of how you can set this up:\n\n   ```python\n   import logging\n   import sys\n\n   # Get the Spark logger\n   logger = logging.getLogger('py4j')\n   logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)\n\n   # Create a StreamHandler to print to console\n   console_handler = logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)\n   console_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)\n\n   # Define a formatter that matches Spark's log format\n   formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n   console_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\n   # Add the handler to the logger\n   logger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\n   # Now you can use the logger\n   logger.info(\"This is an informative message.\")\n   logger.debug(\"This is a debug message.\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Use Spark's Log4j Configuration:**\n   When you submit your job with `spark-submit`, you can specify a log4j properties file to configure the logging. Create a `log4j.properties` file with your desired configuration and include it in your `spark-submit` command:\n\n   ```shell\n   spark-submit --files log4j.properties --conf \"spark.driver.extraJavaOptions=-Dlog4j.configuration=log4j.properties\" your_script.py\n   ```\n\n4. **Ensure Log Level is Configured Correctly:**\n   Make sure that the log level is set to `INFO` or `DEBUG` in your `log4j.properties` if you want to see info or debug messages. Adjust the log levels according to your needs.\n\n5. **Synchronize Logging Across Executors:**\n   If your job is running across multiple nodes, ensure that the logging configuration is synchronized across all executors to maintain consistency in logging output.\n\nBy setting up your Python logging to use a format similar to Spark's log4j configuration and ensuring the log level is properly set, you should be able to see your Python log messages alongside Spark's logs."
