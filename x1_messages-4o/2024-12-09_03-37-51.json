I have a list of custom-class objects, and I want to \"merge\" all of the `stations` sublists into one big list using `list(itertools.chain.from_iterable(myBigList))`. However, I'm having trouble making my custom class an iterable. Below is my custom class:\n\n```python\nclass direction(object) :\n    def __init__(self, id) :\n        self.id = id              \n        self.__stations = list()\n\n    def __iter__(self):\n        self.__i = 0                #  iterable current item \n        return iter(self.__stations)\n\n    def __next__(self):\n        if self.__i<len(self.__stations)-1:\n            self.__i += 1         \n            return self.__stations[self.__i]\n        else:\n            raise StopIteration\n```\n\nI implemented `__iter__` and `__next__` but they don't seem to work, and they're not even called. Can anyone help me figure out what I might have done wrong?"

        "content": "You are on the right track by implementing the `__iter__` and `__next__` methods. However, there are a few issues with your implementation. Let's go through them and correct them:\n\n1. **Redundant `__next__` method**: When making a class iterable, you only need to implement the `__iter__` method that returns an iterator. The `__next__` method is typically part of the iterator itself, not the iterable. Since you are using `iter(self.__stations)`, you don't need to define `__next__` in your class.\n\n2. **State management**: You're trying to manage the iteration state with `self.__i`, but this is unnecessary if you're relying on Python's built-in iterator for lists.\n\nHere's how you can simplify your class to make it iterable:\n\n```python\nclass Direction:\n    def __init__(self, id):\n        self.id = id\n        self.__stations = []\n\n    def add_station(self, station):\n        self.__stations.append(station)\n\n    def __iter__(self):\n        return iter(self.__stations)\n\n# Example usage:\nd1 = Direction(1)\nd1.add_station(\"Station A\")\nd1.add_station(\"Station B\")\n\nd2 = Direction(2)\nd2.add_station(\"Station C\")\nd2.add_station(\"Station D\")\n\nmyBigList = [d1, d2]\n\n# Flatten the list of stations\nflattened_stations = list(itertools.chain.from_iterable(myBigList))\nprint(flattened_stations)\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, the `__iter__` method simply returns an iterator for the `self.__stations` list, making your `Direction` objects iterable. This allows you to use `itertools.chain.from_iterable` directly on a list of `Direction` instances to merge their `stations` lists into one.\n\nAlso, I added a helper method `add_station` to make it easy to add stations to each direction. You can modify this according to your needs."
