Even though the program is still functional, I find the error annoying. How can I remove this error? I have tried all the recommended changes in the linked question but the error still persists."

        "content": "Deprecation warnings, like the one you're encountering with the `imp` module, are common when using libraries that haven't been fully updated to newer Python standards. Here are some steps you can take to address this issue:\n\n1. **Update Packages**: Ensure that all your libraries, especially `scikit-learn` and its dependencies, are up to date. You can update them using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade scikit-learn\n   pip install --upgrade numpy scipy\n   ```\n\n2. **Suppress the Warning**: If updating doesn't resolve the warning, you can suppress it in your Python script. Add the following code at the beginning of your script to ignore deprecation warnings:\n   ```python\n   import warnings\n   warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=DeprecationWarning)\n   ```\n\n3. **Virtual Environment**: Consider using a virtual environment for your project. This can help manage dependencies more effectively and isolate the project environment. You can create and activate a virtual environment with the following commands:\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\\Scripts\\activate`\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Updates**: Sometimes the underlying issue might be in a dependency of `scikit-learn`. Make sure all the related packages are updated, including `joblib` and others that `scikit-learn` might depend on.\n\n5. **Check PyCharm Settings**: Sometimes PyCharm might have a specific configuration that's causing the warning to appear prominently. Check the settings in PyCharm under **Preferences > Editor > Inspections** and see if there's an option related to deprecation warnings that can be adjusted.\n\n6. **Check the Code**: If you have control over the code that's triggering the import of `imp`, change it to use `importlib` instead. However, if it's in a third-party library, this might not be possible without contributing a patch to the library.\n\n7. **Contact Maintainers**: If the issue persists and you believe it's a bug in the library, consider contacting the maintainers of the library or checking the library\u2019s issue tracker on platforms like GitHub for any related discussions.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to either suppress or eliminate the warning, or at the very least, ensure it's not affecting the functionality of your program."
