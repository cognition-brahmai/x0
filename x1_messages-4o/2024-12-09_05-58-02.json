Normally, I would execute a Python script like this: `python myscript.py`, but how can I do it from the interactive mode? I have tried using `exec(File)` but it doesn't seem to work. Also, I need to be able to execute the script multiple times."

Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Open the Python interactive mode** by typing `python` in your terminal or command prompt.\n\n2. **Use the following code to execute your script**:\n\n```python\n# Open the file and read its contents\nwith open('myscript.py', 'r') as file:\n    script_content = file.read()\n\n# Execute the script\nexec(script_content)\n```\n\nThis will run the script `myscript.py` as if you executed it directly. If you need to execute the script multiple times, you can repeat the `exec(script_content)` line as needed.\n\nAlternatively, if you are using IPython or a Jupyter notebook, you can use the `%run` magic command:\n\n```python\n%run myscript.py\n```\n\nThis directly runs the script and is very convenient for interactive work. You can run this command multiple times to execute the script multiple times."
