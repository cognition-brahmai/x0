If the transaction is successful, I get a transaction id as the output. However, if I attempt to transfer an amount that exceeds my Bitcoin balance, I receive the output `error: {\"code\":-4,\"message\":\"Insufficient funds\"}`. When I try to implement this payment in Python using the `subprocess.check_output()` method, the program works fine when there's enough balance but when there's insufficient balance, `sys.exc_info()` provides me with a `subprocess.CalledProcessError` output but does not include the error I receive on the command line. How can I capture the error output `{\"code\":-4,\"message\":\"Insufficient funds\"}` from within Python?"

        "content": "To capture both standard output and standard error when using `subprocess.check_output()` in Python, you can use the `subprocess.run()` function, which provides more control over the subprocess execution. This way, you can capture the error message even when an exception is raised due to a non-zero exit status. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\ndef execute_bitcoin_command(command):\n    try:\n        # Use subprocess.run to capture both stdout and stderr\n        result = subprocess.run(\n            command,\n            shell=True,\n            check=True,\n            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,\n            stderr=subprocess.PIPE,\n            text=True  # Capture output as text (string)\n        )\n        # Return the standard output if the command is successful\n        return result.stdout.strip()\n\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:\n        # Capture and return the standard error if the command fails\n        return f\"Error: {e.stderr.strip()}\"\n\n# Example usage\ncommand = 'bitcoin sendtoaddress <bitcoin address> <amount>'\noutput = execute_bitcoin_command(command)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nIn this setup:\n- `shell=True` allows you to pass the command as a single string, similar to how you would in a shell. Be cautious with this if you're working with untrusted input to avoid shell injection vulnerabilities.\n- `stdout=subprocess.PIPE` and `stderr=subprocess.PIPE` are used to capture the output and error streams.\n- `text=True` ensures that the output is captured as strings, which makes it easier to work with in Python.\n\nThis method will give you the desired error message when the command fails due to reasons such as insufficient funds."
