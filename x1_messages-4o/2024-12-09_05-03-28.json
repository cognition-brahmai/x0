        "content": "Renaming a key in a dictionary in Python typically involves creating a new key-value pair with the desired key name and deleting the old key. However, you can achieve this in an efficient manner using dictionary comprehension or helper functions. Here's an example for a regular dictionary:\n\n```python\ndef rename_dict_key(d, old_key, new_key):\n    if old_key in d:\n        d[new_key] = d.pop(old_key)\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_dict = {'old_key': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}\nrename_dict_key(my_dict, 'old_key', 'new_key')\nprint(my_dict)\n```\n\nThis function checks if the `old_key` exists in the dictionary, then assigns its value to the `new_key` and removes the `old_key`.\n\nFor an `OrderedDict`, you can maintain the position of the key while renaming it. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\n\ndef rename_ordereddict_key(od, old_key, new_key):\n    if old_key in od:\n        # Store the value and remove the old key\n        value = od.pop(old_key)\n        \n        # Find the index to re-insert the new key-value pair\n        keys = list(od.keys())\n        index = keys.index(new_key) if new_key in od else len(keys)\n        \n        # Insert the new key-value pair at the correct position\n        keys.insert(index, new_key)\n        od = OrderedDict((k, od[k]) if k != new_key else (new_key, value) for k in keys)\n\n    return od\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_ordered_dict = OrderedDict([('old_key', 'value1'), ('key2', 'value2')])\nmy_ordered_dict = rename_ordereddict_key(my_ordered_dict, 'old_key', 'new_key')\nprint(my_ordered_dict)\n```\n\nThis function pops the old key, keeps track of its value, and reinserts the new key-value pair at the same position. Note that modifying an `OrderedDict` in this way will require recreating it, as shown."
