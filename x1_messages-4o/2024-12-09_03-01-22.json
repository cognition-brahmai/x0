The cookies I need to send are in this format: \"enwiki_session=17ab96bd8ffbe8ca58a78657a918558e; path=/; domain=.wikipedia.com; HttpOnly\". However, I am unsure how to set up the cookies based on the documentation provided by the Requests library. The only example given in the quickstart documentation is \"cookies = dict(cookies_are='working')\". Do I need to encode the cookie using Python's standard cookie library and then send it with the POST request?"

Instead, you can directly set up the cookies as a dictionary and pass it to the `requests.post()` function.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. First, parse the cookie string to extract the key-value pairs.\n2. Create a dictionary with the cookie names as keys and their values as values.\n3. Pass this dictionary to the `cookies` parameter of the `requests.post()` method.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Your cookie string\ncookie_string = \"enwiki_session=17ab96bd8ffbe8ca58a78657a918558e; path=/; domain=.wikipedia.com; HttpOnly\"\n\n# Parse the cookie string into a dictionary\ncookie_dict = {}\nfor item in cookie_string.split(';'):\n    key_value = item.strip().split('=', 1)\n    if len(key_value) == 2:\n        key, value = key_value\n        cookie_dict[key] = value\n\n# URL you want to send the POST request to\nurl = 'https://www.wikipedia.com/your-post-endpoint'\n\n# Data you want to send with the POST request\ndata = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}\n\n# Send the POST request with the cookies\nresponse = requests.post(url, data=data, cookies=cookie_dict)\n\n# Print the response from the server\nprint(response.text)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `cookie_string` is parsed into a dictionary called `cookie_dict`, which is then passed to the `cookies` parameter of the `requests.post()` method. This will include the specified cookies in your POST request to the given URL.\n\nRemember to replace `'https://www.wikipedia.com/your-post-endpoint'` with the actual endpoint you want to use and to adjust the data payload as needed."
