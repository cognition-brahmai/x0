Below is an example of implementing three different conflict resolution strategies in C++ code, formatted in Markdown for clarity:\n\n### Strategy 1: Accepting Changes Made by One Party Only\nIn this strategy, we simply accept the changes made by the other party, overwriting our own version with theirs.\n\n```cpp\nvoid resolve_conflict_strategy_1(std::string& my_text, const std::string& other_text) {\n    // Accepting changes made by other party\n    // my_text will now be the same as other_text\n    my_text = other_text;\n}\n```\n\n### Strategy 2: Merging Changes Made by Both Parties\nThis strategy attempts to merge the changes made by both parties. If words differ, both are included in the merged result.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <sstream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <string>\n\nvoid resolve_conflict_strategy_2(std::string& my_text, const std::string& other_text) {\n    // Splitting my_text into words\n    std::vector<std::string> my_words;\n    std::istringstream my_stream(my_text);\n    std::string word;\n    while (my_stream >> word) {\n        my_words.push_back(word);\n    }\n\n    // Splitting other_text into words\n    std::vector<std::string> other_words;\n    std::istringstream other_stream(other_text);\n    while (other_stream >> word) {\n        other_words.push_back(word);\n    }\n\n    // Merging the two sets of words into a single string\n    std::string merged_text;\n    size_t i = 0, j = 0;\n    while (i < my_words.size() && j < other_words.size()) {\n        if (my_words[i] == other_words[j]) {\n            merged_text += my_words[i] + \" \";\n            i++;\n            j++;\n        } else {\n            merged_text += my_words[i] + \" \" + other_words[j] + \" \";\n            i++;\n            j++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Adding remaining words\n    while (i < my_words.size()) {\n        merged_text += my_words[i] + \" \";\n        i++;\n    }\n    while (j < other_words.size()) {\n        merged_text += other_words[j] + \" \";\n        j++;\n    }\n\n    // Setting my_text to the merged_text\n    my_text = merged_text;\n}\n```\n\n### Strategy 3: Prompting the User to Manually Resolve the Conflict\nIn this strategy, we prompt the user to choose which version of the text to keep.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n\nvoid resolve_conflict_strategy_3(std::string& my_text, const std::string& other_text) {\n    // Prompting the user to choose which version to keep\n    int choice;\n    std::cout << \"Which version would you like to keep?\" << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"1. My version\" << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"2. Other version\" << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Enter your choice: \";\n    std::cin >> choice;\n\n    // Keeping the chosen version\n    if (choice == 1) {\n        // Keeping my version\n        std::cout << \"Keeping my version.\" << std::endl;\n    } else if (choice == 2) {\n        // Keeping other version\n        std::cout << \"Keeping other version.\" << std::endl;\n        my_text = other_text;\n    } else {\n        std::cout << \"Invalid choice, no changes made.\" << std::endl;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThese strategies cover various common methods for resolving text conflicts: accepting one source's changes, merging both, or allowing user intervention to decide between versions."
