For instance, in the following code:\n\n```python\ndef myfunc(a=4,b=6):\n    sum = a + b\n    return sum\n\nmyfunc()\n```\n\nI am aware that the function does not end because of the return statement as I have seen if statements where if a certain condition is met, it returns a specific value else returns something else. How does Python know that this isn't a recursive function that calls itself? Does the function just keep running through the program until it finds a return?"

        "content": "In Python, the structure and flow of a function are determined by indentation, not by any explicit end statement. Here's how Python understands the end of a function:\n\n1. **Indentation:** Python uses indentation to define blocks of code. The end of a function is determined by the end of the indented block. When the indentation level decreases, Python understands that the block of code has ended. In your example, the function `myfunc` consists of the lines that are indented under the `def` line. Once the indentation ends, Python knows the function definition is complete.\n\n2. **Return Statement:** The `return` statement is used to exit a function and optionally pass an expression back to the caller. However, it doesn't necessarily indicate the end of the function's definition but rather the end of a particular execution path within the function. Once a `return` statement is executed, the function stops executing, and control is returned to the calling code.\n\n3. **End of Indented Block:** After the indented block completes (i.e., when you go back to the previous indentation level or the file ends), Python recognizes that the function definition is complete. You don't need an explicit 'end' keyword, unlike some other languages.\n\n4. **Recursive Functions:** A function calling itself is known as recursion. Python determines recursion through the call itself within the function body. The presence of a return statement does not automatically imply recursion. If a function calls itself within its definition, that's when it is considered recursive.\n\nIn summary, Python uses indentation to determine the scope of a function and the return statement to exit the function. The function definition ends when the indentation level decreases, signaling to Python that the block of code for the function is complete."
