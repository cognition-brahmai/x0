        "content": "I am working on an image classifier with 31 classes using the Office dataset. I have written a python script with PyTorch to load the dataset with `datasets.ImageFolder` and assign a label to each image before initiating training. The code snippet for loading data is as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom torchvision import datasets, transforms\nimport torch\n\ndef load_training(root_path, dir, batch_size, kwargs):\n    transform = transforms.Compose(\n        [transforms.Resize([256, 256]),\n         transforms.RandomCrop(224),\n         transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),\n         transforms.ToTensor()])\n    data = datasets.ImageFolder(root=root_path + dir, transform=transform)\n    train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(data, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True, drop_last=True, **kwargs)\n    return train_loader\n```\n\nThe script takes each folder and assigns the same label to all the images contained within. I am trying to find a way to determine which label is assigned to which image or image folder. Could you guide me on how to achieve this?"

        "content": "Certainly! When using `datasets.ImageFolder` in PyTorch, the labels are assigned based on the alphabetical order of the folder names within the root directory. Each folder within the specified directory represents a class, and `datasets.ImageFolder` automatically assigns a label to each class (folder) based on its alphabetical position.\n\nTo determine which label corresponds to which folder, you can access the `class_to_idx` attribute of the `ImageFolder` dataset object. This attribute provides a dictionary mapping from class names (folder names) to their corresponding indices (labels).\n\nHere's how you can print out the mapping from class names to labels:\n\n```python\nfrom torchvision import datasets, transforms\nimport torch\n\ndef load_training(root_path, dir, batch_size, kwargs):\n    transform = transforms.Compose(\n        [transforms.Resize([256, 256]),\n         transforms.RandomCrop(224),\n         transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),\n         transforms.ToTensor()])\n    data = datasets.ImageFolder(root=root_path + dir, transform=transform)\n    \n    # Print the mapping from class names to labels\n    print(\"Class to Index Mapping:\")\n    for class_name, label in data.class_to_idx.items():\n        print(f\"Class: {class_name} -> Label: {label}\")\n\n    train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(data, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True, drop_last=True, **kwargs)\n    return train_loader\n\n# Example usage\nkwargs = {}\ntrain_loader = load_training('path_to_dataset/', 'train', batch_size=32, kwargs=kwargs)\n```\n\nThis code snippet will output the mapping of class names to labels, showing you exactly which label is assigned to each folder. Make sure to replace `'path_to_dataset/'` and `'train'` with the appropriate paths for your dataset."
