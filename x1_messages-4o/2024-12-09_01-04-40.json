Here are the two methods I've observed:\n\n```\nimport scipy as sp\n```\nand\n```\nimport scipy as sc\n```\nHowever, I'm not sure which one is the officially recommended abbreviation for Scipy. For example, the official documentation for Scipy recommends the following abbreviations for other packages:\n\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib as mpl\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n```\nBut, it doesn't provide a similar recommendation for the Scipy package. I found a question suggesting the use of \"sp\", but the Scipy docs linked there don't specify \"sp\" over \"sc\". Is there an official preference listed anywhere?"

        "content": "The SciPy library itself does not have an official abbreviation recommendation in its documentation, unlike some other libraries like NumPy, which is commonly abbreviated as `np`. The choice of abbreviation is generally up to the user, but there are some conventions that have emerged informally within the Python community.\n\nThe most commonly used abbreviation for SciPy is `sp`. This is based on community practices and the desire for consistency with other abbreviations like `np` for NumPy. Using `sp` helps maintain a level of predictability and readability in code, especially in projects where multiple scientific computing libraries are used together.\n\nHere is a typical way to import SciPy:\n\n```python\nimport scipy as sp\n```\n\nWhile some people might use `sc`, it is not as commonly seen in practice. If you're working on a project with a team or contributing to open-source projects, it's a good idea to stick to the convention of using `sp` to ensure that your code is consistent with what others might expect. Ultimately, though, the choice is yours, and the most important thing is to be consistent within your own codebase."
