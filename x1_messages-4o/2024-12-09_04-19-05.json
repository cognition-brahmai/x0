Currently, when using the datetime module and a user-defined function that uses a generator, the output is not as expected. Here is my code:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import date, timedelta\n\nsdate = date(2019,3,22)   # start date\nedate = date(2019,4,9)   # end date\n\ndef dates_bwn_twodates(start_date, end_date):\n    for n in range(int ((end_date - start_date).days)):\n        yield start_date + timedelta(n)\nprint(dates_bwn_twodates(sdate,edate))\n```\n\nThe current output I'm getting is a generator object, like so:\n\n```python\n<generator object dates_bwn_twodates at 0x000002A8E7929410>\n```\n\nHowever, my expected output is a list of dates in string format, like so:\n\n```python\n['2019-03-22',.....,'2019-04-08']\n```\n\nCan you help me understand what's wrong in my code and how to fix it?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is because you're directly printing the generator object, which only provides a reference and not the values it yields. You need to iterate over the generator to obtain the values. Here's how you can achieve your desired output by converting the date objects to strings:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import date, timedelta\n\nsdate = date(2019, 3, 22)  # start date\nedate = date(2019, 4, 9)   # end date\n\ndef dates_bwn_twodates(start_date, end_date):\n    for n in range(int((end_date - start_date).days)):\n        yield start_date + timedelta(n)\n\n# Generate the list of dates\ndate_list = list(dates_bwn_twodates(sdate, edate))\n\n# Convert date objects to strings in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format\ndate_strings = [d.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') for d in date_list]\n\nprint(date_strings)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generator Iteration**: The `dates_bwn_twodates` function is a generator that yields date objects one by one. To get values from it, you need to iterate over it.\n\n2. **List Conversion**: By using `list(dates_bwn_twodates(sdate, edate))`, you collect all the generated dates into a list.\n\n3. **String Formatting**: The list comprehension `[d.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') for d in date_list]` converts each date object in the list to a string in the format `'YYYY-MM-DD'`.\n\nThis will give you the expected list of dates in string format."
