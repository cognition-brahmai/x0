I have two iterators, `l1 = range(10)` which iterates over 0 to 9 and `l2 = range(10, 20)` which iterates over 10 to 19. I know that I can convert them to lists and concatenate them like `y = list(l1) + list(l2)`, but this can be inefficient. I would like to do something like `y_iter = l1 + l2` but this does not work. What is the best way to achieve this in Python 3?"

        "content": "In Python 3, to efficiently concatenate two iterators without converting them into lists, you can use the `itertools.chain` function. This function is designed to handle exactly this kind of situation by chaining together multiple iterators. Here's how you can use it for your specific example:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nl1 = range(10)\nl2 = range(10, 20)\n\n# Use itertools.chain to concatenate the iterators\ny_iter = itertools.chain(l1, l2)\n\n# If you want to convert the result to a list, you can do so:\ny_list = list(y_iter)\n\n# Print the concatenated list\nprint(y_list)\n```\n\nThis approach is efficient because `itertools.chain` does not create intermediate lists; it simply iterates over each of the input iterators in sequence. This means you can handle large datasets without using a lot of memory. If you only need to iterate over the combined data, you can keep using `y_iter` directly without converting it to a list, which saves both time and space."
