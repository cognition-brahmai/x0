        "content": "To determine the number of times a fruit in column A is paired with a fruit in column B regardless of order, you can use a helper column to standardize the pairs, then count the occurrences of these standardized pairs. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Create a Helper Column (Column C):** In this column, you'll create a standardized pair for each row, where the pair is sorted alphabetically. This way, \"apple, orange\" will be the same as \"orange, apple\".\n\n   In cell C2, enter the following formula:\n   ```excel\n   =IF(A2 < B2, A2 & \", \" & B2, B2 & \", \" & A2)\n   ```\n\n   Drag this formula down for all the rows in your data.\n\n2. **Count the Occurrences:** You can now count the occurrences of each standardized pair using the `COUNTIF` function.\n\n   For example, if you want to count how many times the pair \"apple, orange\" appears, you can use:\n   ```excel\n   =COUNTIF(C:C, \"apple, orange\")\n   ```\n\n3. **List Unique Pairs and Count:** To see all unique pairs and their counts, you can use a pivot table or advanced filter to list unique values from Column C, and then use `COUNTIF` to get the count for each unique pair.\n\nThis process will give you the number of times each unordered pair appears in your data."
