While it does support some procedural programming features, its core design is based on the principles of object-oriented programming, which includes concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Java is not inherently a parallel programming language, though it does provide features for concurrent programming, such as threads and the concurrency API."
