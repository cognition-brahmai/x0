I want to implement a token-based authentication system, so API calls for put, post, and delete operations will only be executed for authorized users. I have installed 'rest_framework.authtoken' and created tokens for each user, so from django.contrib.auth.backends authenticate, it returns a user with an auth_token as an attribute when logged in successfully. How can I send this token with a post request to my API and verify on the API side if the token is valid and belongs to the correct user? Are there any methods in rest_framework.authtoken to validate a given user and their token? I have already added 'rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication' to my DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES in settings.py, and I am sending the token in my header. However, it's still not working. Here's what I have tried so far:\n\n```python\nREST_FRAMEWORK = {\n    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (\n        'rest_framework.authentication.BasicAuthentication',\n        'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication',\n        'rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication',\n    )\n}\n\nif new_form.is_valid:\n    payload= {\"createNewUser\":\n              { \"users\": request.POST[\"newusers\"],\n                \"email\": request.POST[\"newemail\"]\n                }\n              }\n\n    headers =  {'content-type' : 'application/json', \n                'Authorization': 'Token 6b929e47f278068fe6ac8235cda09707a3aa7ba1'}\n\n    r = requests.post('http://localhost:8000/api/v1.0/user_list',\n                      data=json.dumps(payload),\n                      headers=headers, verify=False)\n```\nWhat should I do to make the token authentication work?"

        "content": "To implement token-based authentication using Django Rest Framework (DRF), and to ensure your API calls are authenticated correctly, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Ensure Token Authentication is Enabled:**\n   You've already added `TokenAuthentication` to your `DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES` in settings.py, which is good. Make sure you don't have any middleware or settings that might interfere with the authentication process.\n\n2. **Verify Token Creation:**\n   Ensure that tokens are correctly generated and associated with users. You can create tokens using the DRF management command:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py drf_create_token <username>\n   ```\n   This command creates and prints a token for a specified user.\n\n3. **Check the API Endpoint:**\n   Ensure your API views are protected by token authentication. You can use the `@authentication_classes` and `@permission_classes` decorators to enforce authentication and permission requirements on specific views:\n   ```python\n   from rest_framework.decorators import api_view, authentication_classes, permission_classes\n   from rest_framework.authentication import TokenAuthentication\n   from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated\n\n   @api_view(['POST'])\n   @authentication_classes([TokenAuthentication])\n   @permission_classes([IsAuthenticated])\n   def user_list(request):\n       # Your view logic here\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify the Token Header:**\n   Ensure that the token is sent correctly in the HTTP headers. The format should be:\n   ```\n   Authorization: Token <your_token>\n   ```\n   You are already using this format, so ensure there are no typos or issues with the token itself.\n\n5. **Check Request Validity:**\n   Verify that the request you are making from the client side (using the `requests` library) is correct. Also, ensure that the server is running and accessible at the specified URL.\n\n6. **Debugging:**\n   - **Logs:** Check your server logs to see if there are any errors or messages related to authentication failures.\n   - **Print Statements:** Consider adding logging or print statements in your views to debug where the process might be failing.\n\n7. **Token Expiration:**\n   If you have implemented any custom logic for token expiration, ensure that the token is still valid and not expired.\n\n8. **Test Token Validity:**\n   You can manually test token validity using tools like Postman or curl to ensure that the token you provide is valid and the API responds correctly.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to troubleshoot and resolve any issues with your token-based authentication setup in Django Rest Framework. If the issue persists, consider isolating the problem by testing each component (token creation, header formation, server response) individually."
