I am currently using the code below, but I'd like to set the logging level for multiple scripts from a variable in a single config file. However, when I try to implement this, it doesn't seem to log anything. \n\n```\nLog = logging.getLogger('myLogger')\nLog.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n```\n\nI want to use this instead:\n\n```\nLog = logging.getLogger('myLogger')\nlevels = {'CRITICAL' : logging.critical,\n    'ERROR' : logging.error,\n    'WARNING' : logging.warning,\n    'INFO' : logging.info,\n    'DEBUG' : logging.debug\n}\nlevel = levels['INFO']\nLog.setLevel(level)\n```"

        "content": "To use a variable to set the logging level in Python's logging module, you need to ensure that you're using the correct logging level constant, not the function. In your code, the `levels` dictionary is mapping level names to functions like `logging.info`, which are used to log messages, not to set the logging level. Instead, you should map level names to their corresponding constants like `logging.INFO`.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\n# Create a logger\nLog = logging.getLogger('myLogger')\n\n# Define levels mapping correctly to the logging level constants\nlevels = {\n    'CRITICAL': logging.CRITICAL,\n    'ERROR': logging.ERROR,\n    'WARNING': logging.WARNING,\n    'INFO': logging.INFO,\n    'DEBUG': logging.DEBUG\n}\n\n# Choose the logging level from the dictionary\nlevel = levels['INFO']\n\n# Set the logging level using the variable\nLog.setLevel(level)\n\n# Example logging messages\nLog.debug(\"This is a debug message.\")\nLog.info(\"This is an info message.\")\nLog.warning(\"This is a warning message.\")\nLog.error(\"This is an error message.\")\nLog.critical(\"This is a critical message.\")\n```\n\nIn this setup, you can dynamically change the logging level by altering the value in the `levels` dictionary. Make sure to replace `'INFO'` with whatever level you want to set from your configuration file."
