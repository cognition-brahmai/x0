I am running PyCharm on Windows 10 and have installed PyTorch as per the getting started guide, using Chocolatey and Anaconda for the setup. I can run the PyTorch tutorials from within the PyCharm IDE without any issues, which indicates my setup is correct. However, I don't seem to get any IntelliSense documentation for any of the PyTorch APIs. For instance, when I mouse over the function `randn` in the following code and press CTRL+Q, PyCharm shows me a pop-up of the function definition but no documentation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\nx = torch.randn(128, 20)\n```\n\nI am expecting to see Python comments from the API documentation for that function, similar to the information provided in the PyTorch documentation. I am a beginner with Pytorch and Python, but I have been able to access such documentation from within the IDE with many other languages and libraries. I can't seem to find any instructions on how to enable this feature. What can I do to solve this problem?"

        "content": "To enable IntelliSense documentation for PyTorch in PyCharm, there are a few steps you can take to ensure that you have access to the API documentation directly within the IDE. Since you're already set up with PyCharm and PyTorch on Windows 10, let's look at how you can enhance the documentation visibility:\n\n1. **Ensure PyCharm is Properly Configured:**\n   - Make sure that you have set up a Python interpreter in PyCharm that points to the correct Anaconda environment where PyTorch is installed. You can check this by going to `File` > `Settings` > `Project: <Your Project Name>` > `Python Interpreter`.\n\n2. **Enable Documentation Pop-ups:**\n   - Go to `File` > `Settings` > `Editor` > `General` > `Code Completion`. Ensure that \"Show the documentation popup\" is enabled. This setting will allow PyCharm to automatically show documentation for functions and classes when you hover over them or use shortcuts.\n\n3. **Check for Latest PyCharm Version:**\n   - Ensure that you are using the latest version of PyCharm. JetBrains continuously improves support for libraries and languages, so having the latest version might resolve some documentation issues.\n\n4. **Synchronize and Refresh the Project:**\n   - Sometimes, PyCharm needs to synchronize the project files to update the cache. You can do this by right-clicking on your project root in the \"Project\" pane and selecting \"Synchronize\" or by pressing `Ctrl+Alt+Y`.\n\n5. **Use External Documentation:**\n   - If the internal documentation is not sufficient, you can also configure PyCharm to use external documentation. Go to `File` > `Settings` > `Tools` > `External Documentation` and add the PyTorch documentation URL for direct access.\n\n6. **Reinstall PyTorch with Documentation:**\n   - Sometimes reinstalling the library can help if the stubs or documentation were not downloaded correctly. In your Anaconda environment, try reinstalling PyTorch using:\n     ```\n     conda uninstall pytorch\n     conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio -c pytorch\n     ```\n\n7. **Check PyCharm Python Stubs:**\n   - PyCharm uses stubs to provide documentation and IntelliSense. Sometimes, these stubs might not be up-to-date. You can check if the PyTorch stubs are correctly installed by navigating to the PyTorch package directory within the PyCharm Python SDK paths.\n\n8. **Community Plugins:**\n   - Check PyCharm's plugin marketplace for any community plugins that might improve PyTorch support in PyCharm.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to get better IntelliSense and documentation support within PyCharm for PyTorch. If problems persist, consulting PyCharm community forums or JetBrains support might provide additional insights or solutions specific to your setup."
