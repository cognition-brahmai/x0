        "content": "To determine which symbol is the least commonly used in calculus, you can write a simple Java program to compare the frequencies of the symbols provided in your table. Here's a basic Java code snippet that calculates and identifies the least commonly used symbol:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\nimport java.util.Map.Entry;\n\npublic class SymbolFrequency {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Create a map to store the symbols and their frequencies\n        Map<String, Integer> symbolFrequency = new HashMap<>();\n        symbolFrequency.put(\"\u2211\", 12);\n        symbolFrequency.put(\"\u2202\", 23);\n        symbolFrequency.put(\"\u2208\", 18);\n\n        // Initialize variables to track the least used symbol and its frequency\n        String leastUsedSymbol = null;\n        int minFrequency = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\n\n        // Iterate over the map to find the symbol with the least frequency\n        for (Entry<String, Integer> entry : symbolFrequency.entrySet()) {\n            if (entry.getValue() < minFrequency) {\n                minFrequency = entry.getValue();\n                leastUsedSymbol = entry.getKey();\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Output the result\n        System.out.println(\"The least commonly used symbol is: \" + leastUsedSymbol + \" with a frequency of \" + minFrequency);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis program uses a `HashMap` to store the symbols and their frequencies. It then iterates through the entries of the map to find the symbol with the lowest frequency, and finally prints out the least commonly used symbol along with its frequency. According to your table, the symbol \"\u2211\" is the least commonly used with a frequency of 12."
