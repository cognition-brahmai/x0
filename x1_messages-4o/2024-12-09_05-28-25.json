The library provides two methods for reading an Excel file - one where the whole document is loaded into memory at once, and a second where iterators are used to read the document row-by-row. However, when using the iterator method, I am unable to access document meta-data like column widths and row/column counts, which I require. Is there a method to access this information without having to load the entire document into memory?"

        "content": "When working with large Excel files, it can be challenging to obtain metadata like row counts without loading the entire document into memory. Using OpenPyXL's iterator mode indeed limits access to certain metadata. However, you can consider a few alternative approaches:\n\n1. **Use a Streaming Library**: Libraries like `xlrd` (for older Excel formats) or `openpyxl` with read-only mode can help, but both have limitations when it comes to accessing metadata in a memory-efficient way. If you need to handle very large files efficiently, you might want to consider using a specialized library like `pandas` with the `read_excel` function, specifying parameters like `nrows` to limit the data read into memory.\n\n2. **Read the File Partially**: You could read the file using a binary reader to parse just enough of the file to obtain the row count. This requires some understanding of the Excel file format, which can be complex.\n\n3. **Use Excel's Built-in Tools**: If you have access to Excel itself, you could use Excel's built-in features or VBA scripting to get the row count quickly.\n\n4. **External Tools**: Using command-line tools like `csvkit` to convert Excel files to CSV format and get a row count could be another approach, depending on your environment and needs.\n\n5. **Custom XML Parsing**: Since Excel 2007+ files are essentially zipped XML files, you can unzip the `.xlsx` file and parse the `sheet1.xml` file directly to count the number of `<row>` tags. This method requires some understanding of XML parsing.\n\nHere's an example of using the custom XML parsing approach:\n\n```python\nimport zipfile\nfrom xml.etree import ElementTree as ET\n\ndef get_row_count_xlsx(file_path, sheet_name='sheet1'):\n    with zipfile.ZipFile(file_path, 'r') as z:\n        with z.open(f'xl/worksheets/{sheet_name}.xml') as f:\n            tree = ET.parse(f)\n            root = tree.getroot()\n            rows = root.findall('.//{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main}row')\n            return len(rows)\n\n# Example usage\nfile_path = 'large_file.xlsx'\nrow_count = get_row_count_xlsx(file_path)\nprint(f\"Row count: {row_count}\")\n```\n\nThis code snippet opens the Excel file as a zip archive, locates the XML file for the specified worksheet, and counts the `<row>` elements. Note that this approach assumes the default Excel namespace and may need adjustments for more complex files or different sheet names."
