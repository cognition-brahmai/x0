Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\n# Sample list of datetime objects\ndatetimes = [\n    datetime.datetime(2023, 10, 1, 12, 30, 45, 123456),\n    datetime.datetime(2023, 10, 1, 15, 45, 30, 654321),\n    datetime.datetime(2023, 10, 1, 20, 15, 10, 987654)\n]\n\n# Calculate the average datetime\navg = sum(datetimes, datetime.timedelta(0)) / len(datetimes)\n\n# Create a new timedelta with zero microseconds\navg_without_microseconds = avg - datetime.timedelta(microseconds=avg.microseconds)\n\nprint(avg_without_microseconds)\n```\n\nThis code snippet calculates the average time and subtracts the microseconds from the result, effectively setting the microseconds to zero. This way, your resulting `timedelta` object will not include microseconds."
