I am trying to import it into the interpreter (v2.5), however, the sys.path does not seem to include the current directory. For now, I have been using `sys.path.insert(0,'.')`. Is there a more efficient way to accomplish this? Additionally, when I try to use `from . import mypackage`, I encounter an error that says `ValueError: Attempted relative import in non-package`. How can I solve these issues?"

        "content": "To address the issues you're encountering while developing and testing your package, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Modifying `sys.path`**:\n    - Since you're using Python 2.5, which is quite outdated, the common practice of using `sys.path.insert(0, '.')` is acceptable to include the current directory in the module search path.\n    - However, for a more permanent solution, you can:\n        - Set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to include the current directory. This way, Python will automatically recognize your package without needing to modify `sys.path` manually.\n        - Example: `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:.` (for Unix-based systems like Linux and macOS) or `set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;.` (for Windows).\n\n2. **Relative Imports in Python 2.5**:\n    - Python 2.5 does not support relative imports outside of package contexts. The error `ValueError: Attempted relative import in non-package` indicates that the interpreter does not recognize your module as part of a package.\n    - To work around this issue:\n        - Ensure your module is structured as a package by including an `__init__.py` file in your package directory. This file can be empty but is necessary for Python 2.x to treat directories as packages.\n        - If you're running a script directly and it uses relative imports, you might need to adjust your approach. Instead of using relative imports, consider using absolute imports by specifying the full path from the root of the package.\n        - Alternatively, you can run your script using the `-m` flag from the top-level directory of your package to ensure it's recognized as a package. For example: `python -m mypackage.scriptname`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to develop and test your package more effectively in Python 2.5. However, if possible, consider upgrading to a more recent version of Python, as newer versions have better support for modern practices, improved performance, and security enhancements."
