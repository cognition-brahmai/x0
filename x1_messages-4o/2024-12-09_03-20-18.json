Here's how you can modify your pseudocode into actual Python code:\n\n```python\n# Assume 'largestring' is your string that has been split into lines\nlines = largestring.split('\\n')\n\n# Use a list comprehension to filter out lines that are empty or contain only whitespace\nnon_empty_lines = [line for line in lines if line.strip()]\n\n# Now 'non_empty_lines' contains only the lines that have actual content\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- `largestring.split('\\n')` splits the original string into a list of lines.\n- The list comprehension `[line for line in lines if line.strip()]` iterates over each line. `line.strip()` removes any leading or trailing whitespace. If the line becomes an empty string after stripping, it is considered as false in a boolean context and will not be included in the `non_empty_lines` list.\n\nThis will give you a list of lines that are not empty and do not consist solely of whitespace characters."
