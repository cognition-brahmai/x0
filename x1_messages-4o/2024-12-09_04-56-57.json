Then, I need to multiply the last digit by 2, the second last digit by 3, and so on. How can I split the integer into its individual digits to perform this operation? It's a basic homework task and I'm not allowed to use a list."

        "content": "To solve this problem, you can work with the integer input by repeatedly extracting each digit starting from the last one. Here's a way to do it without using a list:\n\n1. Read the user's input as an integer.\n2. Use a loop to extract each digit using modulus and integer division operations.\n3. Multiply each extracted digit by its corresponding weight (last digit by 2, second last by 3, etc.).\n4. Accumulate the result to calculate the check digit.\n\nHere's a sample code snippet in Python illustrating the process:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_check_digit(isbn):\n    multiplier = 2\n    total = 0\n\n    while isbn > 0:\n        # Extract the last digit\n        digit = isbn % 10\n        \n        # Multiply the digit by the current multiplier\n        total += digit * multiplier\n        \n        # Update multiplier for the next digit\n        multiplier += 1\n        \n        # Remove the last digit from isbn\n        isbn = isbn // 10\n\n    # Calculate the check digit\n    check_digit = total % 11\n    return check_digit\n\n# Read input from user\nuser_input = input(\"Enter the first 9 digits of the ISBN: \")\n\n# Convert the input to an integer\nisbn_number = int(user_input)\n\n# Calculate the check digit\ncheck_digit = calculate_check_digit(isbn_number)\n\nprint(\"The check digit is:\", check_digit)\n```\n\nThis code will prompt the user to enter the first nine digits of the ISBN, perform the required calculations, and then output the check digit. Note that the check digit calculation method used here is based on the ISBN-10 standard. Adjust the logic if you are working with a different standard."
