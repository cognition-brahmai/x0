        "content": "To install a Python package into a specific directory other than the default location using `pip` on your Ubuntu system, you can use the `--prefix` option with `pip install` to specify the installation directory. This is useful when you want to install packages into a custom location such as the Enthought Python Distribution (EPD) directory.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Determine the Installation Directory**: First, you need to know where your Enthought Python Distribution is installed. This is typically in a directory such as `/opt/EPD` or another directory specific to your setup.\n\n2. **Set the PREFIX_PATH**: You will need to set the `PREFIX_PATH` environment variable to the directory where you want the Python package to be installed. This would typically be the base directory of your EPD installation.\n\n3. **Install the Package**: Use the `--prefix` option with `pip install` to install the package into the specified directory. Here is an example command:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/your/EPD\n   pip install --install-option=\"--prefix=$PREFIX_PATH\" package_name\n   ```\n\n   Replace `/path/to/your/EPD` with the actual path to your Enthought Python Distribution and `package_name` with the name of the package you want to install.\n\n**Purpose of $PREFIX_PATH**:\n\n- `$PREFIX_PATH` is an environment variable that you set to specify the base directory for the installation of Python packages. When you use the `--prefix` option with `pip install`, it instructs `pip` to install the package into the directory specified by `$PREFIX_PATH` instead of the default system-wide location or the user-specific location.\n\n**Specifying the Path for Enthought EPD on Ubuntu**:\n\n- If your Enthought EPD is installed in a directory like `/opt/EPD`, you can specify this path as your `PREFIX_PATH`. For example:\n\n  ```bash\n  export PREFIX_PATH=/opt/EPD\n  pip install --install-option=\"--prefix=$PREFIX_PATH\" package_name\n  ```\n\n- Ensure that the directory specified in `PREFIX_PATH` is writable and that you have the necessary permissions to install packages there.\n\nBy following these steps, you can direct `pip` to install Python packages into a custom directory of your choice, suitable for your Enthought Python Distribution setup."
