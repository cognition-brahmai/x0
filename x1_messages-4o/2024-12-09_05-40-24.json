I attempted to use an f-string and replace 'Alex' with curly braces enclosing 'username', but it doesn't seem to work with the raw string literal. How can I solve this?"

        "content": "In Python, raw string literals (prefixed with `r`) interpret backslashes as literal characters, which is useful for file paths. However, you cannot directly combine the raw string prefix with f-strings (prefixed with `f`) because they serve different purposes. \n\nTo achieve what you want, you can use an f-string and escape the backslashes, or you can combine the raw string with string replacement methods. Here\u2019s how you can do it using an f-string:\n\n```python\nusername = input('Enter name: ')\ndownload_folder = f'C:\\\\Users\\\\{username}\\\\Downloads'\n```\n\nIn this code, each backslash is doubled (`\\\\`) to ensure it's treated as a literal backslash in the resulting string.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `str.replace()` method with a raw string if you want to dynamically replace the username in the path:\n\n```python\nusername = input('Enter name: ')\ndownload_folder = r'C:\\Users\\Alex\\Downloads'.replace('Alex', username)\n```\n\nThis method finds the substring `'Alex'` and replaces it with the value of `username`, which allows you to use a raw string for the rest of the path. Both approaches will give you the desired result."
