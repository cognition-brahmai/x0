I am looking for a method to remove this title. I tried using `suptitle('')` as per a previous solution I found on Stack Overflow but it doesn't seem to work. I am currently using the latest pandas version (0.13.1). Is there a way to remove the auto-generated title?"

        "content": "To remove the auto-generated title from a boxplot in pandas when grouped by another column, you can access the `matplotlib` figure object that pandas creates and modify it directly. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'Category': ['A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'C', 'C'],\n    'Value': [10, 20, 15, 25, 10, 30]\n}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Creating a boxplot grouped by 'Category'\nax = df.boxplot(by='Category', column=['Value'])\n\n# Remove the default title\nplt.suptitle('')  # This removes the default title 'Boxplot grouped by Category'\n\n# Optionally remove the group-by title or customize it\nax.set_title('')  # This removes the title above the plot itself\n\n# Show plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- `plt.suptitle('')` is used to remove the overall title that states 'Boxplot grouped by Category'.\n- `ax.set_title('')` clears the title that appears above the individual plot area.\n\nMake sure you have `matplotlib` installed, as it's required for plotting with pandas. This approach should work with the version you're using."
