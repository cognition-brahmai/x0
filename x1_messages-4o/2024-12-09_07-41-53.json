However, the form has two buttons - 'add attached file' and 'create', both of type 'submit'. The 'attach' button is listed first and when I select the form and execute br.submit(), it clicks on the 'attach' button instead of 'create'. How can I select a specific button in a form and skip over the first 'submit' button to click the second one?"

        "content": "To select a specific button when using the `mechanize` library in Python, you need to specify which control you want to submit. Since the form has two buttons of type 'submit', you can use the `br.submit()` method with the `name` or `nr` parameter to specify which button to click. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using the `name` attribute**: If the buttons have distinct `name` attributes, you can specify the `name` of the button you want to click.\n\n2. **Using the `nr` attribute**: If the buttons do not have `name` attributes or have the same `name`, you can specify the button by its index (0-based) using the `nr` parameter. In your case, the 'create' button is the second button, so you would use `nr=1`.\n\nHere's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport mechanize\n\n# Create a browser object\nbr = mechanize.Browser()\n\n# Open the target URL\nbr.open('http://example.com/form')\n\n# Select the form you want to submit\nbr.select_form(nr=0)  # Selects the first form on the page\n\n# Fill out the form fields as needed\nbr['field_name'] = 'value'  # Example of setting a form field\n\n# Submit the form using the second button (assuming 'create' is the second button)\nbr.submit(nr=1)  # 'nr=1' refers to the second submit button on the form\n```\n\nAlternatively, if the buttons have `name` attributes, you can specify the `name`:\n\n```python\nbr.submit(name='create_button_name')  # Replace 'create_button_name' with the actual name attribute of the create button\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `'field_name'`, `'value'`, and `'create_button_name'` with the actual form field names, values, and button name attributes from the form you're working with. This will ensure that the correct button is clicked."
