        "content": "Certainly! The binary search algorithm is an efficient method for finding a specific element in a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it operates:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - Start with two pointers, `low` and `high`, which represent the current search interval. Initially, `low` is set to the first index (0) and `high` is set to the last index of the array.\n\n2. **Middle Element**:\n   - Calculate the middle index (`mid`) of the current interval using the formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{mid} = \\text{low} + \\frac{\\text{high} - \\text{low}}{2}\n     \\]\n   - Check the element at the `mid` index.\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n   - If the middle element is equal to the target number, the search is complete, and the target is found.\n   - If the middle element is less than the target number, it means the target must be in the right half of the array. Set `low` to `mid + 1` and repeat the process.\n   - If the middle element is greater than the target number, it means the target must be in the left half of the array. Set `high` to `mid - 1` and repeat the process.\n\n4. **Repeat**:\n   - Continue this process of halving the interval until `low` exceeds `high`. If this happens, it means the target is not present in the array.\n\n5. **Complexity**:\n   - The binary search algorithm has a time complexity of \\(O(\\log n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of elements in the array. This makes it much more efficient than a linear search, especially for large data sets.\n\nBinary search is applicable only on sorted arrays, as it relies on the ability to discard half of the remaining elements based on a single comparison."
