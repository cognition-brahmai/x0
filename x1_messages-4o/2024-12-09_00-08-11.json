You want to create a code snippet in JavaScript that takes in a sentence and a secret key, and outputs an encrypted message. To make it more challenging, the algorithm must include a mathematical operation and a conditional statement.\nHere's an example:\nconst sentence = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\";\nconst key = \"secret\";\nconst encrypted = `${sentence.split('').reverse().join('')} ${key === \"secret\" ? \"*\" : \"\"}`;\nconsole.log(encrypted);\nThis code will output: \"god yzal eht revo spmuj xof nworb kciuq ehT *\"\nHint: You can use the ASCII code of the characters for mathematical operations."

        "content": "Certainly! Below is a JavaScript code snippet that encrypts a given sentence using a secret key. This encryption algorithm performs a mathematical operation on the ASCII code of each character and uses a conditional statement to modify the encryption process based on the secret key.\n\n```javascript\nfunction encrypt(sentence, key) {\n    // Convert the sentence to an array of characters\n    const chars = sentence.split('');\n    \n    // Initialize an empty array for the encrypted characters\n    let encryptedChars = [];\n    \n    // Loop through each character in the sentence\n    for (let i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {\n        // Get the ASCII code of the character\n        let asciiCode = chars[i].charCodeAt(0);\n\n        // Perform a mathematical operation: shift ASCII code by the key length\n        asciiCode += key.length;\n\n        // Convert the modified ASCII code back to a character\n        encryptedChars.push(String.fromCharCode(asciiCode));\n    }\n    \n    // Reverse the encrypted characters\n    encryptedChars.reverse();\n\n    // Join the encrypted characters into a string\n    let encryptedString = encryptedChars.join('');\n\n    // Add a conditional statement to append a special character if the key is \"secret\"\n    if (key === \"secret\") {\n        encryptedString += \"*\";\n    }\n\n    return encryptedString;\n}\n\nconst sentence = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\";\nconst key = \"secret\";\nconst encrypted = encrypt(sentence, key);\nconsole.log(encrypted);\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `encrypt` takes a `sentence` and a `key` as input.\n- It splits the sentence into an array of characters and processes each character individually.\n- For each character, the ASCII code is shifted by the length of the key, which acts as a simple mathematical operation for encryption.\n- The encrypted characters are then reversed, adding an additional layer of complexity.\n- If the key matches \"secret\", a `*` is appended to the end of the encrypted message.\n- The encrypted message is returned as a string. \n\nThis snippet provides a basic encryption mechanism using character manipulation, ASCII code operations, and a simple conditional logic based on the secret key."
