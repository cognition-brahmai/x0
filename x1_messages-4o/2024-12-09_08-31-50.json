        "content": "Yes, you can absolutely use multiple `except` statements for a single `try` block in Python. This allows you to handle different types of exceptions that might be raised within the `try` block separately. Each `except` clause can specify a different exception type, and Python will execute the first block of code that matches the raised exception. Here's how your code structure would work:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # something1\n    # something2\nexcept ExceptionType1:\n    # handle ExceptionType1\n    # return xyz\nexcept ExceptionType2:\n    # handle ExceptionType2\n    # return abc\n```\n\nHere's a more concrete example:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Attempt to open and read from a file\n    with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:\n        content = file.read()\n        # Attempt to convert the content to an integer\n        number = int(content)\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"The file was not found.\")\nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"The file does not contain a valid integer.\")\n```\n\nIn this example, if the file `file.txt` does not exist, a `FileNotFoundError` will be caught by the first `except` block. If the file exists but does not contain a valid integer, a `ValueError` will be caught by the second `except` block."
