It's perfectly acceptable to have an empty `__init__.py` file if its only purpose is to indicate that the directory is a package. You don't need to insert a `pass` statement or any other content unless you have specific initialization code you want to run when the package is imported.\n\nThere are no specific PEP guidelines that mandate having a `pass` statement in an empty `__init__.py` file. PEP 8, which is the style guide for Python code, does not provide any specific instructions regarding the content of `__init__.py` files.\n\nIn summary, it's both common and acceptable to have empty `__init__.py` files if no initialization is required for your package."
