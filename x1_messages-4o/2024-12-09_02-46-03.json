However, I'm encountering this error:\n\n```python\ncon = connect(user='nishant', host = 'localhost', password='everything') \n File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/psycopg2/__init__.py\", line 179, in connect\nconnection_factory=connection_factory, async=async)\n psycopg2.OperationalError: FATAL:  database \"nishant\" does not exist\n```\nWhat am I doing wrong and how can I fix this?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that the connection attempt is trying to access a database named \"nishant\" by default, which doesn't exist. This typically happens when you don't explicitly specify a database to connect to, and PostgreSQL defaults to trying to connect to a database with the same name as the user.\n\nHere's how you can fix this issue:\n\n1. **Specify a Database to Connect to Initially**: When you first establish a connection, connect to an existing database like `postgres` or `template1`. These are default databases usually present in every PostgreSQL setup.\n\n2. **Adjust Your Connection Code**: Update your connection string to specify an existing database. Here\u2019s the corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\nfrom psycopg2 import connect\nfrom psycopg2.extensions import ISOLATION_LEVEL_AUTOCOMMIT\n\n# Connect to an existing database like 'postgres'\ncon = connect(dbname='postgres', user='nishant', host='localhost', password='everything')\n\ndbname = \"voylla_production1710\"\n\ncon.set_isolation_level(ISOLATION_LEVEL_AUTOCOMMIT)\ncur = con.cursor()\n\n# Use SQL identifiers properly to avoid SQL injection risk\ncur.execute('CREATE DATABASE %s;', (dbname,))\n\ncur.close()\ncon.close()\n```\n\n3. **Consider SQL Injection Prevention**: When creating a database or executing any SQL command, it's a good practice to use parameterized queries or placeholders to prevent SQL injection. However, for database creation, the `CREATE DATABASE` statement doesn't support parameterized queries directly, so you should ensure that `dbname` is a safe and valid identifier.\n\n4. **Check User Permissions**: Ensure that the user `nishant` has the necessary permissions to create a database on the PostgreSQL server. You might need to grant the `CREATEDB` privilege to the user.\n\n5. **Check the psycopg2 Version**: Ensure you're using a compatible version of psycopg2 with your Python and PostgreSQL setup. If you're using Python 2.7, consider upgrading to Python 3, as Python 2.7 is no longer supported.\n\nBy addressing these points, you should be able to create a new PostgreSQL database using psycopg2 in Python successfully."
