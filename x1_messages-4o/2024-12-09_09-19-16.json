        "content": "Yes, you can design a class in Python that reads a source code file and counts the total number of words. Here's a simple example to illustrate this:\n\n```python\nclass SourceCodeWordCounter:\n    def __init__(self, file_path):\n        self.file_path = file_path\n        self.word_count = 0\n\n    def count_words(self):\n        try:\n            with open(self.file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:\n                for line in file:\n                    # Split the line into words based on whitespace\n                    words = line.split()\n                    # Increment the word count\n                    self.word_count += len(words)\n        except FileNotFoundError:\n            print(f\"File not found: {self.file_path}\")\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n    def get_word_count(self):\n        return self.word_count\n\n# Usage\nfile_path = 'source_code.py'  # Replace with your file path\ncounter = SourceCodeWordCounter(file_path)\ncounter.count_words()\nprint(f\"Total number of words in the source code: {counter.get_word_count()}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Initialization**: The class is initialized with the path to the source code file.\n- **`count_words` Method**: This method opens the file, reads it line by line, splits each line into words, and updates the total word count.\n- **Error Handling**: It includes basic error handling for file not found and other potential issues.\n- **Usage**: You create an instance of the class, call the `count_words` method, and then retrieve the total word count using the `get_word_count` method.\n\nYou can customize this class further to meet more specific requirements, such as ignoring comments or counting words in a specific language syntax."
