Specifically, I have a string in Python that reads \"Lisa was tired but she still went to the gym\" and I want to separate it into two separate strings, each containing a simple sentence. The sentence contains a coordinating conjunction, so I need to ensure that the resulting sentences are grammatically correct and semantically meaningful. Can you provide me with a Shell command that can handle various coordinating conjunctions like \"and\", \"or\", and \"yet\"?"

        "content": "To split a compound sentence into two simple sentences using a Shell command, you can use tools like `sed`, `awk`, or `perl`. Here's a simple approach using `perl` to split a sentence containing coordinating conjunctions such as \"and\", \"but\", \"or\", \"yet\", and ensure that the resulting sentences are meaningful.\n\nHere's a basic example using `perl`:\n\n```bash\necho \"Lisa was tired but she still went to the gym\" | perl -pe 's/\\s*(\\b(?:and|but|or|yet)\\b)\\s*/.\\n/g'\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `echo \"Lisa was tired but she still went to the gym\"`: This passes the input sentence to the command.\n- `perl -pe '...'`: This uses Perl to process the input with a regular expression.\n- `s/\\s*(\\b(?:and|but|or|yet)\\b)\\s*/.\\n/g`: This regular expression matches any of the specified conjunctions (using a non-capturing group `(?:...)`), surrounded by optional whitespace `\\s*`. It replaces the conjunction with a period followed by a newline `.\\n`, which effectively splits the sentence.\n\nThe output will be:\n```\nLisa was tired.\nshe still went to the gym\n```\n\nThis command will handle basic cases with the specified conjunctions. For more complex sentence structures, you might need a more sophisticated approach, possibly involving natural language processing tools."
