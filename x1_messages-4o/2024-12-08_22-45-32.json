Your task is to arrange these terms in a specific order to create a logical statement.\nHowever, there are certain rules you must follow:\n1. The term \"diagnosis\" cannot come before the term \"symptom\".\n2. The term \"treatment\" cannot come after the term \"medication\".\n3. The term \"prescription\" cannot come before the term \"treatment\".\n4. The term \"medication\" and the term \"prescription\" cannot be adjacent to each other.\n5. The term \"treatment\" must come before either \"medication\" or \"prescription\".\nYour goal is to create a statement that follows these rules and is also logical in nature. Good luck!"

        "content": "To create a logical statement with the given medical terms while adhering to the rules, let's consider the constraints and arrange them step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the sequence based on the rules**:\n   - Diagnosis must come after symptoms (Rule 1).\n   - Treatment cannot come after medication (Rule 2) and must come before either medication or prescription (Rule 5).\n   - Prescription cannot come before treatment (Rule 3).\n   - Medication and prescription cannot be adjacent (Rule 4).\n\n2. **Logical sequence**:\n   - Start with \"symptom\" as it is typically the first step in a medical process.\n   - Next, after identifying symptoms, you would have a \"diagnosis.\"\n   - Following diagnosis, a \"treatment\" plan would logically be developed.\n   - After treatment, a \"prescription\" may be provided if it involves medication.\n   - Finally, \"medication\" follows as the outcome of a prescription being filled.\n\n3. **Arrange the terms**:\n   - Symptom \u2192 Diagnosis \u2192 Treatment \u2192 Prescription \u2192 Medication\n\n4. **Verify against rules**:\n   - Diagnosis follows symptom (Rule 1: Yes)\n   - Treatment comes before medication (Rule 2: Yes)\n   - Prescription follows treatment (Rule 3: Yes)\n   - Medication and prescription are not adjacent (Rule 4: Yes)\n   - Treatment comes before prescription (Rule 5: Yes)\n\nTherefore, the logical statement following all the rules is:\n\"Symptom leads to a Diagnosis, which is followed by Treatment, then Prescription, and finally Medication.\""
