For instance, in the following dictionary that is comprised of a MySQL database table's columns zipped with the result of reading once from the table:\n\n```python\n{\n 'estimated': '', \n 'suffix': '', \n 'typeofread': 'g', \n 'acct_no': 901001000L, \n 'counter': 0, \n 'time_billed': datetime.datetime(2012, 5, 1, 9, 5, 33), \n 'date_read': datetime.datetime(2012, 3, 13, 23, 19, 45), \n 'reading': 3018L, \n 'meter_num': '26174200'\n}\n```\nI noticed that I can remove the 'L' by passing these values into int(), like so: `int(snapped_read['reading'])`. This changes `3018L` to `3018`. But, I am curious to know why these integers appear with an 'L' suffix in the first place."

        "content": "The 'L' suffix that you are seeing in your dictionary values appears because the integers are represented as long integers in Python 2. In Python 2, there are two types of integers: `int` and `long`. The `int` type is used for smaller numbers, while the `long` type is used for larger numbers. When you print a long integer, Python 2 appends an 'L' to indicate that it is a long integer.\n\nHere\u2019s a bit more detail:\n\n- **Int:** A regular integer type that can store values within a certain range, typically -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.\n- **Long:** An integer type that can store values beyond the range of a regular `int`. It is automatically used when an `int` exceeds its range, or when you explicitly create a long by appending an `L` to a number.\n\nIn Python 3, this differentiation between `int` and `long` was removed, and all integers are of type `int`, regardless of their size. This means that in Python 3, you won\u2019t see an 'L' suffix anymore because the `long` type no longer exists. \n\nIf you're working in a Python 2 environment and don't want to see the 'L' suffix, you can convert these values to `int` using the `int()` function, which you\u2019ve already discovered. However, be mindful that this conversion only works if the number is within the range of a regular `int`.\n\nIf you are maintaining or developing new software, consider migrating to Python 3, as Python 2 has reached the end of its life and no longer receives updates or support."
