        "content": "Yes, you can compile a CUDA program without having a CUDA-capable device on the same node. The NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit includes a compiler called `nvcc` that can compile CUDA code into executable binaries. You don't need a CUDA-capable GPU for the compilation process itself, as `nvcc` can be run on any CPU.\n\nTo compile a CUDA program, you need to have the CUDA Toolkit installed on your machine. The toolkit provides all the necessary libraries and tools for compiling CUDA code. Once installed, you can use `nvcc` to compile your CUDA source files into an executable. Here is a basic example of how you might compile a CUDA program:\n\n```bash\nnvcc -o my_cuda_program my_cuda_program.cu\n```\n\nThis command will compile `my_cuda_program.cu` into an executable named `my_cuda_program`.\n\nEven though you can compile the program without a CUDA-capable GPU, you won't be able to run and test the CUDA code on that machine unless you have a compatible GPU. To run the compiled CUDA program, you'll need to transfer the executable to a machine that has a CUDA-capable GPU.\n\nMoreover, the toolkit includes emulation and debugging tools that can help you test and debug CUDA programs without actual hardware, but these tools have limitations compared to running on real GPU hardware."
