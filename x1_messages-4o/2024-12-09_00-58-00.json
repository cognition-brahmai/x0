When I set `row_cluster=False` or `col_cluster=False`, it removes the dendrograms but also stops the clustering. Also, a previously known hack of setting the width of the dendrogram lines to 0, as suggested in a related question, does not work in seaborn version `0.7.1`. How can I perform 2D clustering but suppress the dendrograms?"

        "content": "To create a clustermap in Seaborn that performs 2D clustering without showing the dendrograms, you can use the `sns.clustermap` function with some additional steps to hide the dendrograms. Even though setting `row_cluster` or `col_cluster` to `False` stops the clustering, you can manipulate the resulting plot to hide the dendrograms. Here's a strategy using the latest versions of Seaborn, as the approach may vary slightly across versions:\n\n1. Perform the clustering to obtain the re-ordered indices for both rows and columns.\n2. Use these indices to reorder your data.\n3. Plot the heatmap without clustering but using the previously obtained order.\n4. Use the plotting parameters to hide the dendrograms.\n\nHere's a step-by-step implementation:\n\n```python\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom scipy.cluster.hierarchy import linkage, leaves_list\n\n# Set up example data\nnp.random.seed(0)\ndata = np.random.rand(10, 10)\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=[f'col{i}' for i in range(10)], index=[f'row{i}' for i in range(10)])\n\n# Perform hierarchical clustering to get the order of indices\nrow_linkage = linkage(df, method='average')\ncol_linkage = linkage(df.T, method='average')\n\nrow_order = leaves_list(row_linkage)\ncol_order = leaves_list(col_linkage)\n\n# Reorder the data according to the clustering\ndf_reordered = df.iloc[row_order, col_order]\n\n# Plot heatmap without dendrograms\nsns.heatmap(df_reordered, cmap='viridis', cbar_kws={'label': 'Intensity'})\nplt.title('Clustermap without Dendrograms')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Clustering**: We use hierarchical clustering (`linkage`) to compute the dendrogram and obtain the order of leaves (`leaves_list`).\n- **Reordering**: We reorder the DataFrame `df` using the indices from `leaves_list`.\n- **Heatmap**: We plot the reordered data using `sns.heatmap`, which displays the clustered data without the dendrograms.\n\nThis approach allows for clustering by rows and columns while suppressing the dendrograms in the visual output. Adjust the linkage method and heatmap parameters as needed for your specific dataset and visualization preferences."
