The 'param' column contains some non-null and null values, and non-null values within groups are always the same. I want to count the non-null value for each group once, and then find the total counts for each value. Currently, I am doing this in a way that seems clunky and inefficient involving a loop. Is there a more efficient way to do this without using a loop? Here is my current code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    'group': [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4],\n    'param': ['a', 'a', 'b', np.nan, 'a', 'a', np.nan]\n})\n\nparam = []\nfor _, group in df[df.param.notnull()].groupby('group'):\n    param.append(group.param.unique()[0])\nprint(pd.DataFrame({'param': param}).param.value_counts())\n```\n\nThe output of this code is:\n\n```python\n# a    2\n# b    1\n```\n\nHow can I accomplish this in a cleaner and more efficient way?"

Here's a cleaner approach to achieve the same result:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    'group': [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4],\n    'param': ['a', 'a', 'b', np.nan, 'a', 'a', np.nan]\n})\n\n# Group by 'group' and aggregate the first non-null 'param' value\nunique_param_counts = df.dropna(subset=['param']).groupby('group')['param'].first().value_counts()\n\nprint(unique_param_counts)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`dropna(subset=['param'])`**: This removes the rows where 'param' is null, ensuring that only non-null values are considered.\n- **`groupby('group')['param'].first()`**: This groups the dataframe by 'group' and retrieves the first non-null 'param' for each group, as non-null values within groups are always the same.\n- **`value_counts()`**: This counts the occurrences of each unique non-null 'param' value across the groups.\n\nThis approach is more concise and utilizes pandas' vectorized operations, which are generally more efficient than looping over the dataframe manually."
