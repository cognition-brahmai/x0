        "content": "When you install software from source, the uninstallation process isn't as straightforward as with package managers. However, you can typically remove a source-installed program by following these steps:\n\n1. **Find the Source Directory**: Locate the directory where you built Python from source. This is usually the directory you downloaded and extracted, where you ran the `./configure`, `make`, and `make install` commands.\n\n2. **Uninstall with Makefile**: If you still have the source directory and the Makefile hasn't been cleaned, you can attempt to run:\n   ```bash\n   sudo make uninstall\n   ```\n   Note that not all source packages support `make uninstall`.\n\n3. **Manual Removal**: If the `make uninstall` option is not available, you can remove the files manually. This requires knowing where the files were installed. By default, this is usually `/usr/local/` for source installations. You might have to remove files from:\n   - `/usr/local/bin/`\n   - `/usr/local/lib/python2.6/`\n   - `/usr/local/include/python2.6/`\n   - Other directories under `/usr/local/` related to Python 2.6.\n\n   Use the following command to list installed files:\n   ```bash\n   sudo find /usr/local -name '*python2.6*'\n   ```\n   Then, you can remove these files manually using `rm`.\n\n4. **Clean Up Environment Variables**: Ensure that any environment variables or symbolic links pointing to the source-installed Python version are updated or removed.\n\n5. **Recheck with `which` Command**: After removal, verify which Python version is being used by default:\n   ```bash\n   which python\n   ```\n\n6. **Update Alternatives**: If you're using the alternatives system, update it to point to the correct Python version:\n   ```bash\n   sudo update-alternatives --config python\n   ```\n\nAlways ensure you have proper backups or the ability to restore the system state before performing manual deletions, as removing critical files can affect system stability."
