However, if you're looking for a more generalized solution that can handle similar cases or potentially more complex text manipulations, you might consider using regular expressions with `preg_replace()`. Here's how you can refactor your code using a regular expression:\n\n```php\n<?php\n$string = \"He's an extremely indolent and lackadaisical individual.\";\n$pattern = \"/extremely indolent and lackadaisical/\";\n$replacement = \"lazy\";\n$new_string = preg_replace($pattern, $replacement, $string);\necho $new_string;\n?>\n```\n\nThis approach allows you to use regular expressions for more flexible and powerful string manipulation. While in this particular case, `str_replace()` is sufficient and arguably more efficient, `preg_replace()` gives you the ability to match more complex patterns if needed in the future."
