You must now select a location that matches a specific criteria. The criteria is that the location name must start and end with the same letter. The JSON file remains the same:\n{\n  \"locations\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Palace of Versailles\",\n      \"type\": \"P\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Montmartre\",\n      \"type\": \"M\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Eiffel Tower\",\n      \"type\": \"E\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Notre Dame Cathedral\",\n      \"type\": \"N\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Louvre Museum\",\n      \"type\": \"L\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\",\n      \"type\": \"C\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Patisserie\",\n      \"type\": \"P\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nCan you also provide a short explanation of your optimized code and the reasoning behind it?"

Below is the modified Ruby code that randomly selects a location from the JSON file where the location name starts and ends with the same letter:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'json'\nrequire 'securerandom'\n\n# JSON data\njson_data = '{\n  \"locations\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Palace of Versailles\",\n      \"type\": \"P\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Montmartre\",\n      \"type\": \"M\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Eiffel Tower\",\n      \"type\": \"E\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Notre Dame Cathedral\",\n      \"type\": \"N\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Louvre Museum\",\n      \"type\": \"L\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\",\n      \"type\": \"C\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Patisserie\",\n      \"type\": \"P\"\n    }\n  ]\n}'\n\n# Parse the JSON data\nplaces = JSON.parse(json_data)\n\n# Filter locations where the name starts and ends with the same letter\nmatching_locations = places['locations'].select do |location|\n  name = location['name']\n  name[0].downcase == name[-1].downcase\nend\n\n# Randomly select a matching location\nif matching_locations.any?\n  selected_location = matching_locations.sample(random: SecureRandom)\n  puts \"Randomly selected location: #{selected_location['name']}\"\nelse\n  puts \"No location found with the specified criteria.\"\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **JSON Parsing**: The JSON data is parsed using `JSON.parse` to convert it into a Ruby hash. This allows us to easily access and manipulate the data.\n\n2. **Filtering Locations**: We use the `select` method to filter locations where the name starts and ends with the same letter. We ensure a case-insensitive comparison by converting the letters to lowercase using `downcase`.\n\n3. **Random Selection**: We utilize `SecureRandom` to provide a more secure and less predictable random selection. The `sample` method is used to randomly select an element from the filtered list of locations.\n\n4. **Output**: The program checks if there are any matching locations. If there are, it prints the randomly selected location. If not, it informs the user that no location matches the criteria.\n\nThis code is optimized for readability and efficiency by utilizing Ruby's built-in methods for filtering and random selection, ensuring a clear and concise implementation."
