I am unsure of where to place my settings and profiles for use with IPython/Jupyter 4.0. Specifically, where should I place general notebook-related settings for use by all kernels/profiles, profile-specific settings for use with notebooks, kernel-specific settings for use by all profiles and applications, and how should I modify or update existing IPython profiles for use with 4.0.0?"

        "content": "With the transition to Jupyter from IPython, the configuration and directory structure has changed a bit. Here's how you can organize your settings and profiles for IPython/Jupyter 4.0:\n\n1. **General Notebook-Related Settings for All Kernels/Profiles:**\n   - These settings should be placed in the `~/.jupyter/` directory. \n   - The main configuration file is `jupyter_notebook_config.py`, which you can generate using the command:\n     ```bash\n     jupyter notebook --generate-config\n     ```\n   - This will create the config file in `~/.jupyter/`, and you can add general settings here.\n\n2. **Profile-Specific Settings for Use with Notebooks:**\n   - Jupyter no longer uses profiles in the same way IPython did. The concept of profiles has essentially been deprecated.\n   - However, if you need to maintain different configurations, you can manually create different configuration files and switch between them as needed. You could script the renaming of these files before launching Jupyter.\n\n3. **Kernel-Specific Settings for Use by All Profiles and Applications:**\n   - Kernel-specific settings are typically handled within the kernel\u2019s own configuration files.\n   - For Python, you can configure the kernel using the `ipython_kernel_config.py` file, which should be located in `~/.ipython/profile_default/`.\n   - You can generate this file using:\n     ```bash\n     ipython profile create\n     ```\n   - Update the settings in `~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_kernel_config.py` for the IPython kernel.\n\n4. **Modifying or Updating Existing IPython Profiles for Use with 4.0.0:**\n   - If you have existing IPython profiles, you may need to manually migrate relevant settings to the new configuration files.\n   - Check your old `~/.ipython/` directory for your profiles and note any custom settings.\n   - Migrate these settings to the appropriate places in `~/.jupyter/` or `~/.ipython/profile_default/`.\n   - Note that some settings may need to be adjusted to work with the new version, so refer to the latest documentation for any configuration changes.\n\nBy organizing your settings and profiles in this way, you should be able to manage your Jupyter and IPython configurations effectively. If you have specific configurations or extensions that you are unsure about, it's always a good idea to check the Jupyter documentation or community forums for guidance on how to adapt them to the new system."
