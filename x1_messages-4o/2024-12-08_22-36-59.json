In your summary of 130 words on this article, please provide at least two specific examples of deep learning applications in industries beyond tech. Additionally, use [Mark down] format to highlight the importance of these applications and explain how they are impacting their respective industries.\nAs you summarize, consider discussing the following Java code example:\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten, Conv2D\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()\ntrain_images = train_images / 255.0\ntest_images = test_images / 255.0\ntrain_images = train_images[..., tf.newaxis]\ntest_images = test_images[..., tf.newaxis]\ntrain_labels = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(train_labels, 10)\ntest_labels = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(test_labels, 10)\nclass MyModel(Model):\n  def __init__(self):\n    super(MyModel, self).__init__()\n    self.conv1 = Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu')\n    self.flatten = Flatten()\n    self.d1 = Dense(128, activation='relu')\n    self.d2 = Dense(10, activation='softmax')\n  def call(self, x):\n    x = self.conv1(x)\n    x = self.flatten(x)\n    x = self.d1(x)\n    return self.d2(x)\nmodel = MyModel()\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',\n              loss='categorical_crossentropy',\n              metrics=['accuracy'])\nmodel.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10)\ntest_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2)\nprint('\\nTest accuracy:', test_acc)\nIn what ways could this code be applied in industries beyond tech?"

        "content": "Deep learning has transformative applications across various industries beyond tech. **In healthcare**, deep learning is revolutionizing diagnostics by analyzing medical images, such as X-rays and MRIs, to detect anomalies with high precision. This enhances early diagnosis and treatment planning, significantly impacting patient outcomes. **In agriculture**, deep learning models are used for crop monitoring and disease detection through image analysis from drones or satellite imagery. This enables efficient resource management and boosts crop yields.\n\nThe provided Java code example, which uses TensorFlow for image classification, can be adapted for these industries. In healthcare, it could classify medical images to identify diseases, while in agriculture, it could analyze plant health from images. The model's ability to learn complex patterns underscores the importance of deep learning in automating and improving processes across diverse fields."
