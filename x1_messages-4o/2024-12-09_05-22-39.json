        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to differences in how file paths are handled across different versions of Python. Specifically, earlier versions of Python 3 did not automatically convert `Path` objects to strings when opening files, which could lead to a `TypeError` when using `open()` with a `Path` object directly.\n\nTo ensure compatibility across different Python versions, you can explicitly convert the `Path` object to a string using the `str()` function. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nfilename = Path(__file__).parent / \"example.txt\"\ncontents = open(str(filename), \"r\").read()\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the `Path` object's `read_text()` method, which simplifies reading the contents of a file:\n\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nfilename = Path(__file__).parent / \"example.txt\"\ncontents = filename.read_text()\n```\n\nUsing `read_text()` is a more idiomatic way to read file contents when working with `pathlib`, and it handles the conversion internally, ensuring compatibility across different Python versions."
