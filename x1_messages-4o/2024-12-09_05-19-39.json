The code I currently use successfully converts the files to UTF-8, but the BOM remains. How would I modify my code to remove the BOM? The code I'm currently using is as follows:\n\n```python\nbatch_3={'src':'/Users/jt/src','dest':'/Users/jt/dest/'}\nbatches=[batch_3]\n\nfor b in batches:\n  s_files=os.listdir(b['src'])\n  for file_name in s_files:\n    ff_name = os.path.join(b['src'], file_name)  \n    if (os.path.isfile(ff_name) and ff_name.endswith('.json')):\n      print ff_name\n      target_file_name=os.path.join(b['dest'], file_name)\n      BLOCKSIZE = 1048576\n      with codecs.open(ff_name, \"r\", \"utf-16-le\") as source_file:\n        with codecs.open(target_file_name, \"w+\", \"utf-8\") as target_file:\n          while True:\n            contents = source_file.read(BLOCKSIZE)\n            if not contents:\n              break\n            target_file.write(contents)\n```\n\nWhen I use `hexdump -C` on the resulting files, I can still see the BOM:\n\n```bash\nWed Jan 11$ hexdump -C svy-m-317.json \n00000000  ef bb bf 7b 0d 0a 20 20  20 20 22 6e 61 6d 65 22  |...{..    \"name\"|\n00000010  3a 22 53 61 76 6f 72 79  20 4d 61 6c 69 62 75 2d  |:\"Savory Malibu-|\n```"

        "content": "To remove the Byte Order Mark (BOM) from your converted UTF-8 files, you can modify your code slightly. The BOM in UTF-8 is represented by the bytes `0xEF`, `0xBB`, `0xBF`, and it is not necessary for UTF-8 encoded files. Here's how you can adjust your code to remove the BOM:\n\n1. Read the contents of the source file as a string, instead of writing them directly to the target file.\n2. Check for the presence of the BOM at the beginning of the string and remove it if present.\n3. Write the modified content to the target file.\n\nHere's the updated version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport codecs\n\nbatch_3 = {'src': '/Users/jt/src', 'dest': '/Users/jt/dest/'}\nbatches = [batch_3]\n\nfor b in batches:\n    s_files = os.listdir(b['src'])\n    for file_name in s_files:\n        ff_name = os.path.join(b['src'], file_name)\n        if os.path.isfile(ff_name) and ff_name.endswith('.json'):\n            print(ff_name)\n            target_file_name = os.path.join(b['dest'], file_name)\n            with codecs.open(ff_name, \"r\", \"utf-16-le\") as source_file:\n                # Read the entire file content\n                contents = source_file.read()\n                # Convert to UTF-8, removing the BOM if present\n                if contents.startswith(u'\\ufeff'):\n                    contents = contents[1:]  # Remove BOM\n                with codecs.open(target_file_name, \"w+\", \"utf-8\") as target_file:\n                    target_file.write(contents)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- **Reading Entire Content**: The entire content of the file is read into a single string using `source_file.read()`.\n- **BOM Check and Removal**: The BOM is detected using `contents.startswith(u'\\ufeff')` and removed by slicing the string (`contents[1:]`).\n- **Writing to Target File**: The modified content is then written to the target file.\n\nThis should effectively remove the BOM from your UTF-8 encoded files."
