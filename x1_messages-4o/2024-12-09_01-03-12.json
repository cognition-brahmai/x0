Here's my code:\n\n```python\nfrom sys import argv\n\nscript, first, second, third = argv\n\nprint (\"The script is called:\", script)\nprint (\"Your first variable is:\", first)\nprint (\"Your second variable is:\", second)\nprint (\"Your third variable is:\", third)\n```\n\nHow do I correctly use the command prompt to pass these arguments into my Python script?"

        "content": "To pass command line arguments to your Python script, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Open your command prompt (or terminal).\n2. Navigate to the directory where your Python script is located.\n3. Run your script by typing `python script_name.py` followed by the arguments you want to pass.\n\nFor example, if your script is named `script.py`, and you want to pass the arguments `arg1`, `arg2`, and `arg3`, you would run the following command:\n\n```shell\npython script.py arg1 arg2 arg3\n```\n\nHere's a simple breakdown of how it works:\n\n- `python` is the command to run Python interpreter.\n- `script.py` is your Python script.\n- `arg1`, `arg2`, and `arg3` are the command line arguments you're passing to your script, which will replace `first`, `second`, and `third` in your script.\n\nMake sure to provide exactly three arguments after the script name, as your current code expects three additional arguments. If you provide fewer or more arguments, Python will raise a `ValueError` because the number of values to unpack does not match the number of variables."
