I've heard that the interpreter stack, which is the list of Python functions called to reach a certain point, is intertwined with the C stack, the list of C functions that were invoked in the interpreter's own code. Based on this, how do generators and coroutines remember their execution state? Does CPython copy each generator's or coroutine's stack to and from an operating system stack? Alternatively, does CPython keep the generator's topmost stack frame on the heap, given that the generator can only yield from that topmost frame?"

        "content": "In CPython, generators and coroutines are implemented using a mechanism that allows them to maintain their execution state without the need to copy stacks or use operating system-specific stack manipulation. Here's how it works:\n\n### Generators in CPython\n\n1. **Stack Frames**: When a generator function is invoked, it does not execute the function body immediately. Instead, it returns a generator object. This object contains the function's code, its execution state (i.e., the current instruction pointer), and its local variables.\n\n2. **Execution State**: Each time the `next()` function is called on the generator, the execution resumes from the last `yield` statement. This is made possible because the stack frame of the generator function is preserved between calls. The local variables and the instruction pointer are saved in the generator object itself.\n\n3. **Heap Storage**: The stack frame of a generator is effectively stored on the heap. This allows the generator to be paused and resumed without needing to copy the call stack to and from the operating system stack. The state is maintained within the generator object, which includes the local variables and the position in the bytecode.\n\n### Coroutines in CPython\n\n1. **Async/Await Syntax**: Coroutines are implemented using the `async def` and `await` syntax. When a coroutine function is called, it returns a coroutine object, similar to how calling a generator function returns a generator object.\n\n2. **Execution State**: Like generators, coroutines maintain their state using a frame object stored on the heap. This frame object stores the local variables, the current position in the code, and any other necessary execution context.\n\n3. **Event Loop**: Coroutines are typically used with an event loop that manages their execution. The event loop schedules coroutines and resumes their execution when they are ready to run. The `await` expression is used to pause the coroutine until the awaited result is available.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn both cases, CPython does not rely on copying stacks to or from the operating system stack. Instead, it stores the necessary execution state within the generator or coroutine object itself, using heap-allocated frame objects. This approach allows CPython to efficiently pause and resume execution of generators and coroutines without the overhead of stack manipulation."
