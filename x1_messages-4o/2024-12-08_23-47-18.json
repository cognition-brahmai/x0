        "content": "To sort an array of integers in ascending order, especially when dealing with a large range of values and a large number of elements, an efficient sorting algorithm is needed. Given the constraints (array length up to \\(10^6\\) and integer range between \\(-10^9\\) to \\(10^9\\)), the Merge Sort or Timsort algorithm would be appropriate choices due to their efficient average and worst-case time complexity of \\(O(n \\log n)\\).\n\nHere's how you can implement a Merge Sort algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\ndef merge_sort(arr):\n    if len(arr) > 1:\n        # Find the middle point to divide the array into two halves\n        mid = len(arr) // 2\n\n        # Divide the array elements into 2 halves\n        left_half = arr[:mid]\n        right_half = arr[mid:]\n\n        # Recursive call on each half\n        merge_sort(left_half)\n        merge_sort(right_half)\n\n        # Initialize pointers for left_half, right_half, and main array\n        i = j = k = 0\n\n        # Copy data to temp arrays L[] and R[]\n        while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):\n            if left_half[i] < right_half[j]:\n                arr[k] = left_half[i]\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                arr[k] = right_half[j]\n                j += 1\n            k += 1\n\n        # Checking if any element was left\n        while i < len(left_half):\n            arr[k] = left_half[i]\n            i += 1\n            k += 1\n\n        while j < len(right_half):\n            arr[k] = right_half[j]\n            j += 1\n            k += 1\n\n# Example usage\narr = [3, -1, 2, 10, -10, 5]\nmerge_sort(arr)\nprint(\"Sorted array is:\", arr)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Divide**: The array is recursively divided into two halves until the base case is reached (i.e., an array of length 1 or 0).\n2. **Conquer**: The two halves are sorted recursively.\n3. **Combine**: The sorted halves are merged together in a sorted manner.\n\nMerge Sort is suitable because:\n- It has a time complexity of \\(O(n \\log n)\\).\n- It works well for large datasets.\n- It guarantees stability and is more efficient with large input sizes compared to other algorithms like Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort.\n\nNote: Python's built-in sorting method, `sorted()` or `list.sort()`, uses Timsort, which is a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from Merge Sort and Insertion Sort, and is also efficient for large datasets."
