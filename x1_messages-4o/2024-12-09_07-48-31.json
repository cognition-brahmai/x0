The 'gevent' library installs fine on Snow Leopard, but not on OS X Lion. I would prefer to use 'pip install' as this would work well with our automated builds.

        "content": "To successfully install the `gevent` library on Mac OS X Lion, you'll need to address the missing header files and the compiler issues you're encountering. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you resolve the installation errors:\n\n1. **Install Xcode Command Line Tools:**\n\n   Make sure you have Xcode and the Command Line Tools installed. You can install them via the terminal:\n\n   ```sh\n   xcode-select --install\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Homebrew:**\n\n   If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can install it by running:\n\n   ```sh\n   /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Install the Required Libraries:**\n\n   The errors you see are due to missing `libevent` headers. You can install `libevent` using Homebrew:\n\n   ```sh\n   brew install libevent\n   ```\n\n4. **Set Environment Variables:**\n\n   You might need to set the `CFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` environment variables to tell the compiler where to find `libevent`. Add the following lines to your `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc` (depending on your shell):\n\n   ```sh\n   export CFLAGS=\"-I/usr/local/opt/libevent/include\"\n   export LDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/local/opt/libevent/lib\"\n   ```\n\n   Then, reload your shell configuration:\n\n   ```sh\n   source ~/.bash_profile\n   ```\n\n   or\n\n   ```sh\n   source ~/.zshrc\n   ```\n\n5. **Use a Compatible Compiler:**\n\n   If you're still having issues with `gcc-4.2`, try using `clang` as the compiler, which is more modern and compatible with newer macOS versions. You can set it temporarily for the installation:\n\n   ```sh\n   export CC=clang\n   ```\n\n6. **Install gevent:**\n\n   Now try installing `gevent` again using `pip`:\n\n   ```sh\n   pip install gevent==0.13.6\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the compilation errors related to missing header files and compiler issues, allowing for a successful installation of the `gevent` library on Mac OS X Lion."
