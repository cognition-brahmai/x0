I am able to do this using a curl command as shown below:\n\n```json\n{  \n  \"mappings\":{  \n    \"logs_june\":{  \n      \"_timestamp\":{  \n        \"enabled\":\"true\"\n      },\n      \"properties\":{  \n        \"logdate\":{  \n          \"type\":\"date\",\n          \"format\":\"dd/MM/yyy HH:mm:ss\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, when I try to do the same thing using Elasticsearch client in Python, it doesn't work. Here's what I've tried:\n\n```python\nself.elastic_con = Elasticsearch([host], verify_certs=True)\nself.elastic_con.indices.create(index=\"accesslog\", ignore=400)\nparams = \"{\\\"mappings\\\":{\\\"logs_june\\\":{\\\"_timestamp\\\": {\\\"enabled\\\": \\\"true\\\"},\\\"properties\\\":{\\\"logdate\\\":{\\\"type\\\":\\\"date\\\",\\\"format\\\":\\\"dd/MM/yyy HH:mm:ss\\\"}}}}}\"\nself.elastic_con.indices.put_mapping(index=\"accesslog\",body=params)\n```"

        "content": "When creating an index with mappings using the Elasticsearch client in Python, you need to ensure that the JSON structure is correctly formatted and passed as a Python dictionary, not as a JSON string. Additionally, the `_timestamp` field is deprecated in newer versions of Elasticsearch, so you might need to adjust your mappings accordingly if you're using a recent version.\n\nHere's how you can set the mappings while creating an index using the Elasticsearch Python client:\n\n```python\nfrom elasticsearch import Elasticsearch\n\n# Establish a connection to the Elasticsearch cluster\nelastic_con = Elasticsearch([host], verify_certs=True)\n\n# Define the mappings\nmappings = {\n    \"mappings\": {\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"logdate\": {\n                \"type\": \"date\",\n                \"format\": \"dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n# Create the index with mappings\nelastic_con.indices.create(index=\"accesslog\", body=mappings, ignore=400)\n```\n\nA few key points to note:\n\n1. **Mapping Structure**: The mappings should be defined inside the `\"mappings\"` field, and there is no need to specify the type name like `\"logs_june\"` unless you're using an older version of Elasticsearch that supports types.\n\n2. **`_timestamp` Field**: The `_timestamp` field has been deprecated since Elasticsearch 2.0. If you're using a newer version, you should handle timestamps in your documents directly rather than relying on this deprecated feature.\n\n3. **Data Types**: Ensure that the data types and formats are correctly specified. In your example, you have specified a date format which should be compatible with the data you plan to index.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: The `ignore=400` parameter is used to suppress errors if the index already exists. You might want to handle this more explicitly depending on your application's requirements.\n\nEnsure you adjust your mappings and index creation logic according to the version of Elasticsearch you are using."
