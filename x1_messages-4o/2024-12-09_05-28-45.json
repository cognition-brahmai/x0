What specific computer science subjects should they focus on, and which programming languages are specifically designed to handle these types of problems? I am interested in industry standards, not personal favorites. For example, would knowledge of Prolog and Matlab be beneficial? Should they study Discrete Structures, Calculus, and Statistics? By Discrete Structures, I mean topics such as graphs and trees, functions and their properties, recursive definitions, solving recurrences, properties of relations, equivalence, partial order, proof techniques, inductive proof, counting techniques, discrete probability, propositional calculus, first-order predicate calculus, formal reasoning, natural deduction, resolution, applications to program correctness and automatic reasoning, and an introduction to algebraic structures in computing?"
