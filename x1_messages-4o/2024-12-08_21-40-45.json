For example, imagine a person who was forced to participate in a robbery because their family was being threatened by a criminal organization. While the act of robbery is illegal, the extenuating circumstance of protecting their family under immediate threat could be considered a mitigating factor. In such cases, a pardon might be granted to acknowledge that the individual's actions, although unlawful, were influenced by extreme pressure and a lack of viable alternatives."
