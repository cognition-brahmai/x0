Despite saving the figure with `fig.savefig(...)` and deleting it with `fig.clear(); del fig` after each creation, I am getting a `RuntimeWarning: More than 20 figures have been opened. Figures created through the pyplot interface (matplotlib.pyplot.figure) are retained until explicitly closed and may consume too much memory.` I am unsure as to why I am receiving this warning, given at no point in my code do I have more than one figure open at a time. Can someone explain why this is happening and how can I avoid getting this warning?"

        "content": "The warning you're encountering is due to how Matplotlib manages figures created through the `pyplot` interface. When you create a figure using `plt.subplots()`, it keeps a reference to the figure object internally, which can lead to excessive memory usage if not properly managed.\n\nHere are some steps to avoid this warning and properly manage your figures:\n\n1. **Close the figure explicitly**: Use `plt.close(fig)` after you are done with the figure. This will release the memory associated with the figure and remove the reference from the internal list of open figures.\n\n2. **Clear the figure**: While you are already using `fig.clear()`, this only clears the content of the figure but doesn't release the memory associated with it. You should combine it with `plt.close(fig)`.\n\n3. **Avoid using `del fig`**: The `del fig` statement only deletes the variable reference but does not close the figure or release the memory. Use `plt.close(fig)` instead.\n\nHere's a revised version of your workflow:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Example function to create and save a figure\ndef create_and_save_figure():\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n    # ... your plotting code here ...\n    fig.savefig('your_figure.png')\n    plt.close(fig)  # Properly close the figure\n\n# Assuming you are doing this in a loop or multiple times\nfor _ in range(30):  # Example of creating multiple figures\n    create_and_save_figure()\n```\n\nBy using `plt.close(fig)`, you ensure that each figure is properly closed and removed from the internal list, thereby avoiding the warning about having too many open figures."
