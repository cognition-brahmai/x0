When I use 'df.set_index('Timestamp')' to set the index, I don't receive an error, but when I print the dataframe, the index still shows as the row number. How can I effectively set 'Timestamp' as the index of my dataframe?"

If you want to modify the original DataFrame in place, you need to either assign the result back to the original DataFrame or use the `inplace` parameter. Here is how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Assign the result back to the original DataFrame:**\n\n   ```python\n   df = df.set_index('Timestamp')\n   ```\n\n   This will replace the original DataFrame with the new one that has 'Timestamp' as the index.\n\n2. **Use the `inplace` parameter:**\n\n   ```python\n   df.set_index('Timestamp', inplace=True)\n   ```\n\n   This modifies the original DataFrame directly without needing to reassign it.\n\nMake sure that the 'Timestamp' column exists in your DataFrame and that there are no issues with the data format. After setting the index, you can print the DataFrame to verify that the index has been updated:\n\n```python\nprint(df.head())\n```\n\nThis should display the DataFrame with 'Timestamp' as the index instead of the row numbers."
