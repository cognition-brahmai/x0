For example, if we have 3 items of \"Groceries\" with a quantity of 3 and a price of $4.20, the total amount purchased should be $12.60."

        "content": "Certainly! To calculate the total amount purchased in an Excel table named \"Groceries\" with columns \"Item\", \"Quantity\", and \"Price\", you can use a formula to multiply the quantity by the price for each item and then sum the total.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to setting it up:\n\n1. **Set Up Your Table:**\n\n   | Item     | Quantity | Price | Total   |\n   |----------|----------|-------|---------|\n   | Item1    | 3        | 4.20  |         |\n   | Item2    | 2        | 5.50  |         |\n   | Item3    | 1        | 7.30  |         |\n\n2. **Calculate Total for Each Item:**\n\n   In the \"Total\" column, you will calculate the total cost for each item by multiplying the \"Quantity\" by the \"Price\". For example, in the first row corresponding to \"Item1\", place the following formula in the \"Total\" column (D2):\n\n   ```\n   =B2 * C2\n   ```\n\n   Drag this formula down for all items in the \"Groceries\" table to fill in the \"Total\" column.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Amount Purchased:**\n\n   To find the total amount purchased for all items, you can use the `SUM` function. Below the \"Total\" column, add a cell where you will calculate the grand total. Assuming your table's \"Total\" column entries are from D2 to D4, you can place the following formula in a cell, say D5:\n\n   ```\n   =SUM(D2:D4)\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you will have an Excel table that calculates the total amount purchased for all items in the \"Groceries\" table. For the example you provided, the formula in D2 would evaluate to 12.60 for \"Item1\" with a quantity of 3 and a price of $4.20."
