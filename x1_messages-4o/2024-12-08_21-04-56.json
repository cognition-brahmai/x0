For example, if I have the sentence \"The dog hopped over the fence\", how can I replace \"dog\" with a synonym like \"canine\" and \"hopped\" with a synonym like \"jumped\"? Can you provide an example MATLAB code to accomplish this task?"

        "content": "Certainly! To replace specific words in a sentence with their synonyms using MATLAB, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the sentence.\n2. Create a mapping of words to their synonyms.\n3. Split the sentence into words.\n4. Replace the words using the mapping.\n5. Reconstruct the sentence.\n\nHere's a sample MATLAB code to achieve this:\n\n```matlab\n% Define the sentence\nsentence = 'The dog hopped over the fence';\n\n% Define a dictionary with words and their synonyms\nsynonyms = containers.Map({'dog', 'hopped'}, {'canine', 'jumped'});\n\n% Split the sentence into words\nwords = strsplit(sentence, ' ');\n\n% Replace words with their synonyms\nfor i = 1:length(words)\n    word = words{i};\n    % Check if the word has a synonym in the dictionary\n    if isKey(synonyms, word)\n        words{i} = synonyms(word);\n    end\nend\n\n% Reconstruct the sentence from words\nnew_sentence = strjoin(words, ' ');\n\n% Display the new sentence\ndisp(new_sentence);\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- We first define the original sentence.\n- We create a `containers.Map` object to map specific words to their synonyms.\n- The sentence is split into individual words using `strsplit`.\n- We iterate through each word, check if it has a synonym in the dictionary, and replace it if necessary.\n- The modified list of words is combined back into a single sentence using `strjoin`.\n- Finally, the new sentence is displayed.\n\nThis code can be expanded to include more words and synonyms in the dictionary as needed."
