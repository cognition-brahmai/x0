Currently, I am dividing the number by 3 or 5 and checking if the result is an integer. However, I am not sure how to properly implement this check. Here is my current code:\n\n```python\nn = 0\ns = 0\n\nwhile (n < 1001):\n    x = n/3\n    if isinstance(x, (int, long)):\n        print 'Multiple of 3!'\n        s = s + n\n    if False:\n        y = n/5\n        if isinstance(y, (int, long)):\n            s = s + n\n\n    print 'Number: '\n    print n\n    print 'Sum:'\n    print s\n    n = n + 1\n```\n\nHow can I correctly implement this functionality?"

        "content": "To check whether a number is divisible by another number, you can use the modulus operator (`%`). If a number `n` is divisible by another number `d`, then `n % d` will be `0`. This is an efficient way to determine divisibility.\n\nIn your current code, you're using division and checking the type of the result, which is not optimal. Instead, you can use the modulus operator to simplify the logic.\n\nHere's a revised version of your code that correctly checks if each number from 1 to 1000 is a multiple of 3 or 5 and sums them up:\n\n```python\nn = 0\ns = 0\n\nwhile n < 1001:\n    if n % 3 == 0:\n        print('Multiple of 3!')\n        s = s + n\n    elif n % 5 == 0:\n        print('Multiple of 5!')\n        s = s + n\n\n    print('Number:', n)\n    print('Sum:', s)\n    n = n + 1\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Modulus Operator**: I used `n % 3 == 0` to check if `n` is a multiple of 3 and `n % 5 == 0` to check if `n` is a multiple of 5.\n2. **Removed `isinstance` Check**: The `isinstance` check is not needed since the modulus operator directly tells us if there's a remainder.\n3. **Corrected `if False:` Issue**: The `if False:` statement was preventing the check for multiples of 5 from running. Changed to `elif` to ensure both checks are made if applicable.\n\nThis code will iterate through numbers from 0 to 1000, check if each number is a multiple of 3 or 5, and accumulate the sum of those numbers."
