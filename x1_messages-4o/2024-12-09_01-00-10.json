For instance, when I try:\n\n```python\nsubset = df.loc[:,('A':'C', 'E')]\n```\n\nI get an error. How can I index in Pandas if I want to select column A to C, E, and G to I? The logic I tried below does not seem to work:\n\n```python\nsubset = df.loc[:,('A':'C', 'E', 'G':'I')]\n```\n\nCan you guide me on how to solve this error?"

        "content": "To index multiple, non-sequential columns in a Pandas DataFrame, you need to use a list containing the desired column names. The syntax you attempted using `('A':'C', 'E', 'G':'I')` is incorrect because slicing with colons is not valid inside a tuple like that.\n\nInstead, you can use the `list()` function to combine the ranges and specific columns you want. Here's how to achieve your goal of selecting columns A to C, E, and G to I:\n\n```python\nsubset = df.loc[:, list(df.loc[:, 'A':'C'].columns) + ['E'] + list(df.loc[:, 'G':'I'].columns)]\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `df.loc[:, 'A':'C'].columns` selects columns A to C.\n2. `['E']` is explicitly added to the list of columns you want.\n3. `df.loc[:, 'G':'I'].columns` selects columns G to I.\n4. `list()` is used to convert the selected columns to lists, which are then concatenated using `+`.\n\nThis approach allows you to combine sequential and non-sequential columns into a single subset of your DataFrame."
