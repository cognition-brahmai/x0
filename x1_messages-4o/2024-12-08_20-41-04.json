Here's the C++ code to calculate the intersection point:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    // Line 1: y = 2x + 1\n    // Line 2: y = 3x + 2\n\n    // Set the equations equal to each other to find the x-coordinate\n    // 2x + 1 = 3x + 2\n\n    // Rearrange to find x\n    // 2x + 1 = 3x + 2\n    // 1 = x + 2\n    // 1 - 2 = x\n    // x = -1\n\n    double x = -1;\n\n    // Substitute the value of x into either of the original equations to find y\n    // Using y = 2x + 1\n    double y = 2 * x + 1;\n\n    std::cout << \"The intersection point of the two lines is: (\" << x << \", \" << y << \")\" << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis code calculates the intersection point of the two lines. By setting the equations equal to each other, solving for \\( x \\), and substituting \\( x \\) back into one of the original equations, we find that the intersection point is \\((-1, -1)\\)."
