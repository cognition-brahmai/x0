I have a string like `my_path = '$HOME/dir/dir2'` and I would like to replace the `$HOME` with its actual value from the environment variables. I am trying to achieve this output: \n```\nHOME = /home/user1\nPATH = /home/user1/dir/dir2\n```\nHere is my current code:\n```python\nprint \"HOME =\",os.environ['HOME']\nmy_expanded_path = parse_string(my_path)\nprint \"PATH =\", my_expanded_path\n```\nIs there a simple way to do this in Python?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this by using the `os.path.expandvars()` function from the `os` module, which is specifically designed to expand environment variables in strings. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired output:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nmy_path = '$HOME/dir/dir2'\n\n# Expand the environment variable in the string\nmy_expanded_path = os.path.expandvars(my_path)\n\n# Print the results\nprint(\"HOME =\", os.environ['HOME'])\nprint(\"PATH =\", my_expanded_path)\n```\n\nThis code will correctly replace `$HOME` with its actual value from the environment variables and produce the output you want:\n\n```\nHOME = /home/user1\nPATH = /home/user1/dir/dir2\n```\n\nThe `os.path.expandvars()` function scans the input string for `$name` or `${name}` patterns and replaces them with the value of the environment variable `name`. If the environment variable doesn't exist, it leaves the variable reference unchanged. This is a simple and elegant solution for your use case."
