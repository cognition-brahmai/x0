        "content": "What is the purpose of the \"where\" argument in setuptools.find_packages? I am working on a Python project where I've tried to separate the source code and unit tests. The project structure is as follows:\n\n```\nMyProject/\n    MANIFEST.in\n    README.md\n    setup.py\n    source/\n        __init.py__\n        my_project/\n            __init.py__\n            some_module.py\n    test/\n        __init.py__\n        my_project/\n            __init.py__\n            test_some_module.py\n```\n\nIn my `setup.py` file, I have used `find_packages(where='./source')` as shown below:\n\n```\nfrom setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\nsetup(\n    name='my_project',\n    packages=find_packages(where='./source'),\n    description='My project to be packaged',\n    version='1.0.0',\n    author='me',\n    install_requires=[\n        'fastnumbers~=2.0.1',\n        'numpy~=1.14.1',\n        'pandas~=0.22.0'\n    ],\n    extras_require={\n        'dev': ['check-manifest'],\n        'test': [\n            'mock',\n            'PyHamcrest',\n            'pytest',\n            'pytest-cov'\n        ],\n    }\n)\n```\n\nHowever, when I run the command `python3 setup.py sdist`, it fails with the output: \n\n```\nrunning sdist\nrunning egg_info\nwriting my_project.egg-info/PKG-INFO\nwriting requirements to my_project.egg-info/requires.txt\nwriting dependency_links to my_project.egg-info/dependency_links.txt\nwriting top-level names to my_project.egg-info/top_level.txt\nerror: package directory 'my_project' does not exist\n```\n\nThe resulting `top_level.txt` file appears fine:\n\n```\nmy_project\n```\n\nBut it seems `setuptools` is not starting from the `source` folder to find the modules to be packaged. Should I move `setup.py` and `MANIFEST.in` files into the `source` folder? And what exactly is the `where` argument for in `setuptools.find_packages` function?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The `where` argument in `setuptools.find_packages` is used to specify the directory from which to start searching for packages. By default, `find_packages` searches in the current directory. In your case, by setting `where='./source'`, you're telling `setuptools` to start looking for packages inside the `source` directory.\n\nYour project structure suggests that `my_project` is nested within the `source` directory. When you specify `find_packages(where='./source')`, `setuptools` should correctly identify `my_project` as a package located under the `source` directory. However, the error message you're seeing indicates that it cannot find the `my_project` directory, which usually means that the relative path specified in `where` isn't being interpreted as expected.\n\nHere are a few possible reasons and solutions for the issue:\n\n1. **Path Specification:** Ensure that the path specified in `where` is correct and relative to the location of `setup.py`. If `setup.py` is outside the `source` directory, then `where='./source'` should work. If `setup.py` were inside the `source` directory, you would use `where='.'` instead.\n\n2. **Directory Structure:** Double-check the directory names and structure. Ensure there are no typos and that `__init__.py` files are present, as these are required to recognize directories as Python packages.\n\n3. **File Permissions:** Verify that the `source` directory and its contents have the appropriate permissions and are accessible when running `setup.py`.\n\n4. **Environment:** Make sure you are running the `setup.py` script from the correct directory. You should be in the root directory of your project (where `setup.py` is located) when running `python3 setup.py sdist`.\n\n5. **Relative Paths:** If your `setup.py` and `source` directory are indeed correctly structured, and the error persists, try explicitly specifying the absolute path to the `source` directory as a troubleshooting step.\n\nPutting `setup.py` and `MANIFEST.in` inside the `source` directory is not necessary if your current directory structure and `where` argument are correct. Keep them in the root directory of the project to maintain a clear separation between configuration and source code.\n\nIf you've confirmed that all the above points are correct and the issue persists, try printing out the list of packages found by `find_packages` to debug further:\n\n```python\nimport setuptools\n\nprint(setuptools.find_packages(where='./source'))\n```\n\nThis will give you an indication of what `setuptools` is finding with the current configuration."
