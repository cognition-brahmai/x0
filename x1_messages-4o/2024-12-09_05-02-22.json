Since Stretch does not come with older versions of gcc, I am required to use clang as the host compiler because nvcc does not support gcc-6. Currently, I am invoking nvcc with `nvcc -ccbin clang-3.8`. Is there a way to set this up system-wide, possibly through CUDA configuration or an environment variable?"

        "content": "To set `clang` as the default host compiler for `nvcc` on your Debian Stretch system with CUDA 8, you can use the `CUDAHOSTCXX` environment variable. This variable allows you to specify the host compiler used by `nvcc` without needing to pass the `-ccbin` option every time.\n\nHere's how you can set it up:\n\n1. **Set the Environment Variable:**\n\n   You can set `CUDAHOSTCXX` to point to your `clang` compiler by adding the following line to your shell's configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc` for bash or `.zshrc` for zsh):\n\n   ```bash\n   export CUDAHOSTCXX=$(which clang-3.8)\n   ```\n\n   This line sets `CUDAHOSTCXX` to the path of `clang-3.8`, making it the default host compiler for `nvcc`.\n\n2. **Reload Your Shell Configuration:**\n\n   After adding the line to your shell's configuration file, reload it to apply the changes:\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bashrc   # For bash\n   # or\n   source ~/.zshrc    # For zsh\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify the Setup:**\n\n   You can verify that `nvcc` is using `clang-3.8` as its host compiler by compiling a simple CUDA program and checking the compilation output.\n\nBy setting `CUDAHOSTCXX` in your shell configuration, you make `clang-3.8` the default host compiler for `nvcc` across all your terminal sessions, simplifying your workflow."
