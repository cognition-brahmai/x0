You want to ensure that your mental health and wellness are prioritized during this task, so you decide to implement a timer that will pause the sequence generation process after a certain amount of time has elapsed. \nYour goal is to implement this timer using only the following commands in Python:\n- time.time() returns the current time in seconds since the Epoch\n- time.sleep(secs) suspends the execution of the current thread for a given number of seconds\nCan you write a function that generates an infinite sequence of prime numbers, but pauses the sequence generation for 10 seconds after every 60 seconds of execution time? The function should return the nth prime number, where n is passed as an argument to the function."

        "content": "Certainly! Below is a Python function that generates an infinite sequence of prime numbers and pauses for 10 seconds after every 60 seconds of execution time. The function returns the nth prime number, where `n` is passed as an argument to the function.\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef is_prime(num):\n    if num < 2:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef generate_nth_prime(n):\n    start_time = time.time()\n    prime_count = 0\n    num = 2\n\n    while True:\n        current_time = time.time()\n        elapsed_time = current_time - start_time\n        \n        if elapsed_time >= 60:\n            print(\"Pausing for 10 seconds...\")\n            time.sleep(10)\n            start_time = time.time()  # Reset the start time after the pause\n\n        if is_prime(num):\n            prime_count += 1\n            if prime_count == n:\n                return num\n        num += 1\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 100  # Change this to whatever nth prime you want to find\nnth_prime = generate_nth_prime(n)\nprint(f\"The {n}th prime number is: {nth_prime}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **is_prime Function**: This helper function checks if a number is prime.\n2. **generate_nth_prime Function**:\n   - It starts by recording the `start_time`.\n   - It loops indefinitely, checking each number to see if it's prime.\n   - If a number is prime, it increments the `prime_count`.\n   - If `prime_count` reaches `n`, it returns the current prime number.\n   - Every time 60 seconds of execution time have elapsed, it pauses for 10 seconds and resets the `start_time`.\n   \nThis function will effectively generate prime numbers while implementing a work-break cycle to ensure mental well-being during long-running computations."
