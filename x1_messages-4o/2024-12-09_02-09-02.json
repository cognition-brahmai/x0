        "content": "To install a `.whl` file using the `wheel` library, you actually use the `pip` tool rather than the `wheel` library itself. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\n1. **Ensure You Have pip Installed**: Make sure you have `pip` installed on your system. You can check this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip --version\n   ```\n\n   If it's not installed, you can usually get it by following the instructions on the [official pip installation guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).\n\n2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open your command line interface (CLI) or terminal and navigate to the directory where your `.whl` file is located using the `cd` command. For example:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd path/to/your/whl/file\n   ```\n\n3. **Install the .whl File**: Use `pip` to install the `.whl` file. Replace `your-file-name.whl` with the actual file name:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install your-file-name.whl\n   ```\n\n   Ensure that you are using the correct Python environment if you have multiple Python installations. You might need to use `pip3` if you're targeting Python 3, for example:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip3 install your-file-name.whl\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify Installation**: After the installation process is complete, you can verify that the package is installed by checking the list of installed packages:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip list\n   ```\n\n   Look for the package name in the list to confirm that it has been installed.\n\nThat's it! You should now have the package from the `.whl` file installed in your Python environment. If you encounter any errors during the process, make sure to check the compatibility of the `.whl` file with your Python version and system architecture."
