        "content": "To solve this problem, we'll first calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100, then subtract the sums of the multiples of 3, multiples of 5, and add back the multiples of both 3 and 5 (i.e., multiples of 15) since they were subtracted twice.\n\n1. **Sum of all numbers from 1 to 100:**\n\n   The sum of the first \\( n \\) natural numbers is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum} = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\n   \\]\n   For \\( n = 100 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum} = \\frac{100 \\times 101}{2} = 5050\n   \\]\n\n2. **Sum of multiples of 3 from 1 to 100:**\n\n   The multiples of 3 up to 100 are 3, 6, 9, ..., 99. This is an arithmetic series where the first term \\( a = 3 \\), the common difference \\( d = 3 \\), and the last term \\( l = 99 \\).\n\n   The number of terms \\( n \\) in this series can be found by:\n   \\[\n   l = a + (n-1) \\times d \\Rightarrow 99 = 3 + (n-1) \\times 3\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( n \\):\n   \\[\n   99 = 3n \\Rightarrow n = 33\n   \\]\n\n   Sum of this series:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum} = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a + l) = \\frac{33}{2} \\times (3 + 99) = 33 \\times 51 = 1683\n   \\]\n\n3. **Sum of multiples of 5 from 1 to 100:**\n\n   The multiples of 5 up to 100 are 5, 10, 15, ..., 100. This is an arithmetic series where the first term \\( a = 5 \\), the common difference \\( d = 5 \\), and the last term \\( l = 100 \\).\n\n   The number of terms \\( n \\) in this series can be found by:\n   \\[\n   l = a + (n-1) \\times d \\Rightarrow 100 = 5 + (n-1) \\times 5\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( n \\):\n   \\[\n   100 = 5n \\Rightarrow n = 20\n   \\]\n\n   Sum of this series:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum} = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a + l) = \\frac{20}{2} \\times (5 + 100) = 10 \\times 105 = 1050\n   \\]\n\n4. **Sum of multiples of 15 from 1 to 100:**\n\n   The multiples of 15 up to 100 are 15, 30, 45, ..., 90. This is an arithmetic series where the first term \\( a = 15 \\), the common difference \\( d = 15 \\), and the last term \\( l = 90 \\).\n\n   The number of terms \\( n \\) in this series can be found by:\n   \\[\n   l = a + (n-1) \\times d \\Rightarrow 90 = 15 + (n-1) \\times 15\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( n \\):\n   \\[\n   90 = 15n \\Rightarrow n = 6\n   \\]\n\n   Sum of this series:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum} = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a + l) = \\frac{6}{2} \\times (15 + 90) = 3 \\times 105 = 315\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Calculation:**\n\n   Now, we compute the final sum by subtracting the sums of multiples of 3 and 5 and adding back the sum of multiples of 15:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final Sum} = 5050 - 1683 - 1050 + 315 = 3632\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the result of adding the numbers from 1 to 100, excluding all multiples of 3 and 5, is **3632**."
