For example, why does 'a'.encode() return b'a' instead of 01100001? If Python bytestring is an immutable sequence of bytes without any particular interpretation, shouldn't it return something like b'01100001'? Also, when I write a bytestring to a file using this code:\n\n```python\nwith open('testbytestring.txt', 'wb') as f:\n    f.write(b'helloworld')\n```\nWhy does it insert 'helloworld' as a regular string into the file, not as a sequence of bytes? Is a bytestring in ASCII?"

        "content": "A Python bytestring is a sequence of bytes, which are integers in the range 0 to 255. It's a way to represent binary data in Python. Let's break down how bytestrings work and how encoding and file writing interact with them.\n\n### How Encoding Works\n\nWhen you call `'a'.encode()`, Python uses a specific encoding (by default, UTF-8) to convert the character `'a'` into a bytes object. In UTF-8, the character `'a'` is represented by the byte `0x61`, which is `97` in decimal and `01100001` in binary. However, when Python outputs a bytes object like `b'a'`, it displays the ASCII representation of the byte if it's a printable character. If it were a non-printable byte, Python would show its hexadecimal value like `\\x61`.\n\n### Why Not Binary Representation?\n\nPython doesn't show the binary representation `01100001` for a couple of reasons:\n\n1. **Readability**: It's much more human-readable to display bytes as ASCII characters when possible. This is why you see `b'a'` instead of `b'01100001'`.\n   \n2. **Standard Practice**: The bytes object is a sequence of bytes, and displaying them as ASCII characters (when possible) aligns with how bytes are generally represented in programming.\n\n### Writing Bytestrings to a File\n\nWhen you write a bytestring to a file using:\n\n```python\nwith open('testbytestring.txt', 'wb') as f:\n    f.write(b'helloworld')\n```\n\nYou're telling Python to write the raw bytes to the file. The `'wb'` mode means \"write binary\", which preserves the bytes as they are. The file will contain the raw byte representation of `b'helloworld'`, which corresponds to the ASCII values of each character. So, each character in `'helloworld'` corresponds to its ASCII byte value and gets written as such.\n\n### ASCII and Bytestrings\n\nA bytestring like `b'helloworld'` does not inherently have any encoding like ASCII or UTF-8. It's just a sequence of bytes. However, if the bytes correspond to ASCII values (like in this case), you can interpret it as an ASCII string. ASCII is a subset of UTF-8, so when you write characters that fall within the ASCII range using UTF-8 encoding, they are represented identically.\n\nIn summary, Python's bytestrings represent sequences of bytes, and when you use the default UTF-8 encoding, printable bytes are shown as their corresponding ASCII characters. When writing to a file in binary mode, the exact bytes are written, which, if they represent ASCII values, appear as regular text when viewed."
