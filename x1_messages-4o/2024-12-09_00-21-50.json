Click on the `Modules` tab.\n   - You should see your project listed there. Click on it to highlight it.\n   - Below the list, there is a section labeled `Content Roots`. Click the `+` button to add a new content root.\n   - Navigate to `c:\\test\\my\\scripts\\` and select it.\n\n4. **Mark as Source**:\n   - After adding the directory, make sure it is marked as a source directory. \n   - To do this, select the newly added directory under `Content Roots`, and click on the `Sources` button (it looks like a blue folder icon).\n\n5. **Apply Changes**:\n   - Click `Apply` and then `OK` to close the Project Structure dialog.\n\n6. **Verify**:\n   - You can verify that the directory has been added by checking if you can import the modules within your PyCharm editor without any import errors.\n\nBy following these steps, PyCharm will recognize the modules in `c:\\test\\my\\scripts\\` and allow you to import them as part of your project."
