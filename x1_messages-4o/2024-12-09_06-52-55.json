I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling Python, as well as using the pip install email command, but none of these solutions have resolved the issue. I am using Windows 7 Home Premium x64, with an x86 version of Python. Here is the error message I receive when I attempt to import the email module:\n\n```python\nc:\\Users\\Nicholas\\Desktop>python\nActivePython 2.7.2.5 (ActiveState Software Inc.) based on\nPython 2.7.2 (default, Jun 24 2011, 12:21:10) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] on win\n32\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> import email\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"email.py\", line 1, in <module>\n    import smtplib\n  File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\smtplib.py\", line 46, in <module>\n    import email.utils\nImportError: No module named utils\n>>>\n```\nI've also tried different versions of Python, including the version from python.org and ActivePython, but neither of these have worked. Is there a way to completely remove Python and all its data from my system, so I can start fresh?"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering suggests that there might be a naming conflict with the `email` module. It seems like you might have a file named `email.py` in your current directory, which is causing Python to try and import your local file instead of the standard library module. Here's how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check for Conflicting Files**: Ensure that there is no file named `email.py` in your working directory or any directory within your Python path. Rename or remove any such files.\n\n2. **Clear the `__pycache__` Directory**: If there's a `__pycache__` directory in your project or script directory, delete it. This directory stores compiled Python files and might cause issues if there are naming conflicts.\n\n3. **Verify Python Installation**: Make sure your Python installation is correct. You don't need to install the `email` module separately as it is part of the Python Standard Library.\n\n4. **Reinstall Python (if necessary)**: If the above steps don't fix the problem, you might want to reinstall Python:\n   - Uninstall Python through Control Panel > Programs and Features.\n   - Delete any remaining Python directories, such as `C:\\Python27` or similar paths.\n   - Ensure your `PATH` environment variable is also cleaned of any old Python paths.\n   - Reinstall Python from the official Python website and ensure you choose the correct architecture (32-bit vs. 64-bit) for your system.\n\n5. **Test Import**: After resolving the file conflict and ensuring a clean installation, try importing the module again using a simple script or directly in the Python shell:\n   ```python\n   import email\n   print(email.__file__)\n   ```\n\nThis should give you the correct path to the `email` module in the Python Standard Library. If you follow these steps, you should be able to resolve the import issue successfully."
