The user receives an email with a direct link within the app. If they're not already logged in, they get redirected to the login page. However, after successfully logging in, the user is redirected to a hardcoded path instead of the referrer page. I tried to implement a \"next\" redirect, but it results in an exception \"Key 'next' not found in <QueryDict: {}>\". The form doesn't seem to post the \"next\" variable, even though it's present in the URL and in the form. I can't figure out why this isn't working. Can anyone help me solve this?"

        "content": "Certainly! Redirecting users to the original page they were trying to access before logging in is a common requirement in web applications. Let's walk through the steps to troubleshoot and implement this correctly in Django.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Redirect Issue\n\n1. **Ensure the `next` parameter is being passed:**\n   - When a user is redirected to the login page, make sure the URL contains the `next` parameter, like so: `/login/?next=/desired/path/`. This should be handled by the login_required decorator or middleware.\n\n2. **Update the login view to handle the `next` parameter:**\n   - Ensure that your login view captures the `next` parameter and redirects the user accordingly after a successful login.\n\nHere\u2019s the typical way to handle it in a Django view:\n\n```python\nfrom django.shortcuts import render, redirect\nfrom django.contrib.auth import authenticate, login\nfrom django.http import HttpResponseRedirect\n\ndef login_view(request):\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        # Get the username and password from the POST request\n        username = request.POST['username']\n        password = request.POST['password']\n        user = authenticate(request, username=username, password=password)\n        \n        if user is not None:\n            login(request, user)\n            # Get the 'next' parameter from the GET request or default to homepage\n            next_url = request.GET.get('next', '/')\n            return HttpResponseRedirect(next_url)\n        else:\n            # Handle invalid login\n            return render(request, 'login.html', {'error': 'Invalid credentials'})\n\n    # If it\u2019s a GET request, just render the login page\n    else:\n        return render(request, 'login.html')\n```\n\n3. **Ensure your login form retains the `next` parameter:**\n   - Make sure your login form includes a hidden input field to pass the `next` parameter. Here\u2019s an example snippet for your login template:\n\n```html\n<form action=\"{% url 'login' %}\" method=\"post\">\n  {% csrf_token %}\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"next\" value=\"{{ request.GET.next }}\">\n  <!-- Your username and password fields -->\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"username\">\n  <input type=\"password\" name=\"password\">\n  <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Login\">\n</form>\n```\n\n4. **Check URL Configuration:**\n   - Ensure that your URL configuration properly routes to the login view and includes the `next` parameter.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Django's built-in login view:** If you are using Django's built-in authentication views, you can simply pass the `next_page` parameter to the `LoginView`:\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib.auth.views import LoginView\n\nclass CustomLoginView(LoginView):\n    redirect_authenticated_user = True  # Redirect if already authenticated\n    template_name = 'login.html'\n\n    def get_success_url(self):\n        return self.get_redirect_url() or '/'\n\n# In your urls.py\nfrom django.urls import path\nfrom .views import CustomLoginView\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    path('login/', CustomLoginView.as_view(), name='login'),\n]\n```\n\n- **Middleware or Decorators:** If you\u2019re using a custom middleware or decorator to enforce login, ensure it preserves the `next` parameter correctly.\n\nBy ensuring that the `next` parameter is correctly passed through the login process, you should be able to redirect users to their intended destination after login. If you continue to face issues, double-check your template and view logic for any discrepancies."
