My code currently writes each character in a separate cell, instead of writing the entire word in one cell. Here's the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nwith open('Sprint_data.csv', 'ab') as csvfile:\n  spamwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)\n  models = soup.find_all('li' , {\"class\" : \"phoneListing\"})\n\n  for model in models:\n      model_name = unicode(u' '.join(model.a.stripped_strings)).encode('utf8').strip()\n      spamwriter.writerow(unicode(u' '.join(model.a.stripped_strings)).encode('utf8').strip())\n```\n\nThe output is like this:\n\n|  S  |  A  |   M  |   S  |   U   |  N  |   G   |\n\nBut I want it to be:\n\n|SAMSUNG|\n\nWhat am I missing in my code?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is that the `csv.writer.writerow()` function expects an iterable (like a list or tuple) as its argument, and it writes each element of the iterable to a separate cell in the CSV file. Since you're passing a string to `writerow()`, it treats the string as an iterable of characters and writes each character to a separate cell.\n\nTo fix this, you should wrap the string in a list so that `writerow()` treats the entire string as a single cell entry. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport csv\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n# Sample HTML content for demonstration\nhtml_content = \"\"\"\n<ul>\n  <li class=\"phoneListing\"><a href=\"#\">SAMSUNG</a></li>\n  <li class=\"phoneListing\"><a href=\"#\">APPLE</a></li>\n</ul>\n\"\"\"\n\n# Parse the HTML content\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')\n\nwith open('Sprint_data.csv', 'w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:\n    spamwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)\n    models = soup.find_all('li', {\"class\": \"phoneListing\"})\n\n    for model in models:\n        model_name = ' '.join(model.a.stripped_strings)\n        spamwriter.writerow([model_name])  # Wrap the model_name in a list\n```\n\nHere's a summary of the changes:\n\n1. I wrapped `model_name` in a list when calling `spamwriter.writerow()`, i.e., `spamwriter.writerow([model_name])`. This ensures that the entire string is treated as a single entry to be written in one cell.\n\n2. I used `newline=''` and `encoding='utf-8'` when opening the file to ensure that the CSV file is written correctly, especially for Python 3.\n\nNow, your output in the CSV file should look like this:\n\n```\n|SAMSUNG|\n|APPLE  |\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that the entire text extracted from the anchor tag is written into a single cell in the CSV file."
