Below is a simple Ruby program that prints the first 10 Fibonacci numbers:\n\n```ruby\ndef fibonacci(n)\n  fib_sequence = [0, 1]\n\n  (2...n).each do |i|\n    fib_sequence << fib_sequence[i - 1] + fib_sequence[i - 2]\n  end\n\n  fib_sequence\nend\n\n# Print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers\nputs fibonacci(10).join(', ')\n```\n\nThis program defines a `fibonacci` method that calculates Fibonacci numbers up to the `n`-th number. It initializes the sequence with the first two Fibonacci numbers, 0 and 1, and then iterates to compute the subsequent numbers by summing the two preceding numbers. Finally, it prints the first 10 numbers in the sequence."
