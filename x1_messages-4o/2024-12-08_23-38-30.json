Your task is to complete the implementation of the \"DataProcessing\" class by transforming the input data into an output file that sorts people by age in ascending order. But here's the twist - you need to do it using only logical deductions! \nYou will be given a file in JSON format containing information about people, including their names, ages, and addresses. Your job is to extract the names and ages of all people whose addresses are in California and return them in ascending order of age. But you cannot simply rely on the given methods; instead, you must write your own method named \"sortData\" that uses logical reasoning to sort the data. \nTo do this, you must first implement a \"getData\" method that reads the input file and returns the data as a string. Then, you need to use your logical reasoning skills to implement the \"sortData\" method that takes the data read from the file as input, extracts the required information, sorts the data, and returns the sorted data as a list of strings. Finally, implement the \"writeData\" method that takes the sorted data as input and writes it to the output file named \"output.txt\". Each line in the file should contain a person's name followed by a space and then their age. \nRemember, you cannot rely on pre-written methods for this challenge; instead, you must use your own logical deductions to sort the data. Good luck and happy puzzling!"

        "content": "Sure! Let's implement the `DataProcessing` class with the required methods: `getData`, `sortData`, and `writeData`. The logical portion of the challenge is to implement sorting without relying on built-in sorting functions. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\nclass DataProcessing:\n    def __init__(self, input_file):\n        self.input_file = input_file\n\n    def getData(self):\n        # Read the input JSON file and return the data as a string\n        with open(self.input_file, 'r') as file:\n            data = file.read()\n        return data\n\n    def sortData(self, data_string):\n        # Parse the JSON data\n        data = json.loads(data_string)\n\n        # Extract names and ages of people in California\n        people_in_california = []\n        for person in data:\n            if 'address' in person and 'California' in person['address']:\n                people_in_california.append((person['name'], person['age']))\n\n        # Sort the list using logical deduction (simple selection sort)\n        sorted_people = []\n        while people_in_california:\n            # Find the minimum age in the list\n            min_person = people_in_california[0]\n            for person in people_in_california:\n                if person[1] < min_person[1]:\n                    min_person = person\n            # Append the minimum age person to the sorted list\n            sorted_people.append(min_person)\n            # Remove the minimum age person from the original list\n            people_in_california.remove(min_person)\n\n        # Format the sorted data as a list of strings\n        sorted_data = [f\"{name} {age}\" for name, age in sorted_people]\n        return sorted_data\n\n    def writeData(self, sorted_data):\n        # Write the sorted data to the output file\n        with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:\n            for line in sorted_data:\n                file.write(line + '\\n')\n\n# Usage example\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    data_processor = DataProcessing('input.json')\n    data_string = data_processor.getData()\n    sorted_data = data_processor.sortData(data_string)\n    data_processor.writeData(sorted_data)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **getData**: This method reads the contents of the input JSON file and returns it as a string.\n\n2. **sortData**: This method performs the following steps:\n   - Parses the JSON string to extract the data.\n   - Filters out people whose address contains \"California\".\n   - Uses a selection sort algorithm to sort the list of tuples (name, age) by age. The sorting is done through logical reasoning by iterating over the list to find the minimum age, adding it to a sorted list, and removing it from the original list until all elements are sorted.\n\n3. **writeData**: This method writes the sorted data to \"output.txt\", with each line containing a person's name and age separated by a space.\n\nThis solution avoids using built-in sort functions and instead uses logical reasoning to sort the data."
