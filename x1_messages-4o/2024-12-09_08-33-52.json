        "content": "Yes, the AKS primality test, which was famously proven to determine whether a number is prime in polynomial time, has several Python implementations available that you can use for benchmarking. Here is a simple implementation of the AKS primality test in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom math import isqrt, log, gcd\n\ndef is_perfect_power(n):\n    for b in range(2, isqrt(n) + 1):\n        a = int(n ** (1 / b))\n        if a**b == n or (a + 1)**b == n:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef multiplicative_order(a, n):\n    if gcd(a, n) != 1:\n        return 0\n    order = 1\n    k = a % n\n    while k != 1:\n        k = (k * a) % n\n        order += 1\n    return order\n\ndef aks_primality_test(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n\n    if is_perfect_power(n):\n        return False\n\n    r = 2\n    while True:\n        if multiplicative_order(n, r) > (log(n, 2) ** 2):\n            break\n        r += 1\n\n    for a in range(2, min(r, n)):\n        if n % a == 0:\n            return False\n\n    for a in range(1, int(log(n, 2)) + 1):\n        if pow(a, n, n) != a % n:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Example usage\nn = 101\nif aks_primality_test(n):\n    print(f\"{n} is a prime number.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"{n} is not a prime number.\")\n```\n\nThis code implements the AKS primality test in Python. It checks for perfect powers, finds a suitable `r`, and performs the necessary checks to determine whether the input number `n` is prime. Keep in mind that while the AKS algorithm is theoretically polynomial, it is not the fastest in practice compared to other primality tests like the Miller-Rabin test or the elliptic curve primality proving algorithm for large numbers.\n\nFeel free to run this implementation and compare its performance with other methods. Adjustments and optimizations can be made based on specific requirements and input size."
