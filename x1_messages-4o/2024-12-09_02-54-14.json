How can I achieve the same in Python?"

        "content": "In Python, you can perform time series decomposition using the `statsmodels` library, which provides functions similar to R's `decompose` and `stl` for separating a time series into its components: trend, seasonal, and residual. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Using `seasonal_decompose` from `statsmodels`:**\n\n   The `seasonal_decompose` function is similar to R's `decompose` function. It allows you to decompose a time series into its seasonal, trend, and residual components.\n\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n   from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n   # Example time series data\n   data = pd.Series([your_time_series_data], index=pd.date_range(start='YYYY-MM-DD', periods=n, freq='your_frequency'))\n\n   # Decompose the time series using additive or multiplicative model\n   result = seasonal_decompose(data, model='additive')  # or model='multiplicative'\n\n   # Plot the decomposed components\n   result.plot()\n   plt.show()\n   ```\n\n   Replace `[your_time_series_data]`, `'YYYY-MM-DD'`, `n`, and `'your_frequency'` with your actual data and frequency settings.\n\n2. **Using `STL` from `statsmodels`:**\n\n   The `STL` (Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS) method is more robust and flexible compared to `seasonal_decompose`. It can handle more complex seasonal patterns.\n\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n   from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import STL\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n   # Example time series data\n   data = pd.Series([your_time_series_data], index=pd.date_range(start='YYYY-MM-DD', periods=n, freq='your_frequency'))\n\n   # STL decomposition\n   stl = STL(data, seasonal=7)  # Adjust 'seasonal' parameter as needed\n   result = stl.fit()\n\n   # Plot the decomposed components\n   result.plot()\n   plt.show()\n   ```\n\n   Again, replace `[your_time_series_data]`, `'YYYY-MM-DD'`, `n`, and `'your_frequency'` with your actual data and frequency settings. You may need to adjust the `seasonal` parameter based on your data's periodicity.\n\nBy using these methods, you can easily decompose a time series into its underlying components in Python, similar to what you would do in R using `decompose` and `stl`."
