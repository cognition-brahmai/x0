I've tried to use the set_file_logger function as shown in the following code but it doesn't seem to work. How can I disable or redirect the logging without modifying the boto files?\n\n```\nimport boto\nboto.set_file_logger('boto', 'logs/boto.log')\n```\n\nI found a thread (http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/thread.jspa?messageID=52727&amp;#52727) that states it's possible to do this, but I can't find documentation on how to actually implement it."

        "content": "To manage logging in Boto and redirect or disable it, you can use Python's logging module to configure the logging settings to suit your needs. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n### Disabling Logging\n\nTo completely disable logging, you can set the logging level to `CRITICAL` (or higher) for Boto, which will suppress most log messages:\n\n```python\nimport logging\nimport boto\n\n# Get the boto logger\nboto_logger = logging.getLogger('boto')\n\n# Set the logging level to CRITICAL to suppress lower-level messages\nboto_logger.setLevel(logging.CRITICAL)\n```\n\n### Redirecting Logging to /dev/null\n\nIf you want to redirect logs to `/dev/null` (effectively discarding them), you can add a `NullHandler` to the logger:\n\n```python\nimport logging\nimport boto\n\nclass NullHandler(logging.Handler):\n    def emit(self, record):\n        pass\n\n# Get the boto logger\nboto_logger = logging.getLogger('boto')\n\n# Add a NullHandler to the boto logger\nboto_logger.addHandler(NullHandler())\n```\n\n### Redirecting Logging to a File\n\nIf you'd prefer to redirect logs to a specific file, you can use a `FileHandler`:\n\n```python\nimport logging\nimport boto\n\n# Get the boto logger\nboto_logger = logging.getLogger('boto')\n\n# Create a file handler\nfile_handler = logging.FileHandler('path/to/your/logfile.log')\n\n# Optionally, set the format for the log messages\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nfile_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\n# Add the file handler to the boto logger\nboto_logger.addHandler(file_handler)\n\n# Set the logging level (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)\nboto_logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)\n```\n\nThese configurations should be added before any Boto operations are performed to ensure that logging is properly configured from the start. Adjust the file path and logging level to fit your specific requirements."
