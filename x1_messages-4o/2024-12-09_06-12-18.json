When I try to rebind the dict name, the {key: value} comprehension syntax still returns a regular dict. How can I modify this behavior to return an OrderedDict or my own dictionary type? I am specifically interested in understanding the flexibility of Python's grammar, so I'm open to solutions that only work in CPython. I have tried the following code, but it doesn't produce the desired result:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\nolddict, dict = dict, OrderedDict\n{i: i*i for i in range(3)}.__class__\n```"

        "content": "In Python, the dictionary comprehension syntax `{key: value for key, value in iterable}` is designed to return a `dict` object, and this behavior is hardcoded in the Python language itself. Therefore, simply rebinding the `dict` name to another class, such as `OrderedDict`, does not affect the output of a dictionary comprehension.\n\nHowever, you can achieve the desired behavior by using an explicit constructor for the type of dictionary you want. You can create an OrderedDict or any custom dictionary type by passing a generator expression to its constructor. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\n\n# Create an OrderedDict using a generator expression\nordered_dict = OrderedDict((i, i*i) for i in range(3))\nprint(ordered_dict)  # Output: OrderedDict([(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 4)])\n```\n\nIf you want to use your own custom dictionary type that inherits from `dict`, you can do the same:\n\n```python\nclass MyDict(dict):\n    pass\n\n# Create an instance of MyDict using a generator expression\nmy_dict = MyDict((i, i*i) for i in range(3))\nprint(my_dict)  # Output: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4}\n```\n\nIn these examples, the generator expression `(i, i*i) for i in range(3)` creates an iterable of key-value pairs that can be passed to any dictionary-like class constructor, including `OrderedDict` or any custom subclass of `dict`.\n\nTo answer your question regarding extending Python's grammar specifically in CPython, modifying Python's grammar or its core implementation to change the behavior of dictionary comprehensions is not a trivial task and would require altering the Python source code itself. This is not recommended as it would lead to non-standard behavior that would not be portable to other Python implementations or future versions."
