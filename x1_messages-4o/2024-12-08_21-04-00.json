Each laundry load takes 2 hours, and posting a favorable review on the product page leads to additional time. Could you provide a Java program that can determine the precise number of detergent bottles needed based on the given information?"

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of eco-friendly detergent bottles required based on the number of laundry loads. Since each bottle handles 8 loads and reduces water usage by 30%, the calculation is straightforward once you determine the number of laundry loads. Here's a Java program that demonstrates this:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class DetergentCalculator {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        \n        // Inputs\n        System.out.print(\"Enter the total number of laundry loads you plan to do: \");\n        int totalLoads = scanner.nextInt();\n        \n        // Each bottle handles 8 loads\n        int loadsPerBottle = 8;\n        \n        // Calculate the number of bottles needed\n        int bottlesNeeded = (int) Math.ceil((double) totalLoads / loadsPerBottle);\n        \n        // Output the result\n        System.out.println(\"You will need \" + bottlesNeeded + \" bottle(s) of eco-friendly detergent.\");\n        \n        // Optional: Calculate total time saved by reducing water usage by 30%\n        double waterReduction = 0.30; // 30% water reduction\n        double timePerLoad = 2.0; // 2 hours per load\n        double totalTime = totalLoads * timePerLoad;\n        double timeSaved = totalTime * waterReduction;\n        \n        System.out.println(\"Time saved by using eco-friendly detergent: \" + timeSaved + \" hours.\");\n        \n        // Optional: Additional time consideration for posting reviews\n        System.out.print(\"Do you plan to post a favorable review? (yes/no): \");\n        String reviewResponse = scanner.next();\n        if (reviewResponse.equalsIgnoreCase(\"yes\")) {\n            System.out.print(\"Enter the additional time gained by posting a review (in hours): \");\n            double reviewTime = scanner.nextDouble();\n            System.out.println(\"Additional time gained: \" + reviewTime + \" hours.\");\n        }\n        \n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Inputs**: The program prompts the user to enter the total number of laundry loads.\n2. **Calculation**: It calculates the number of detergent bottles needed by dividing the total loads by the loads each bottle can handle (8) and rounds up to ensure full coverage.\n3. **Output**: It outputs the number of detergent bottles required.\n4. **Water Usage Reduction**: It calculates the time saved by reducing water usage by 30% for each load.\n5. **Review Bonus**: Optionally, the program asks if the user plans to post a favorable review and considers additional time gained.\n\nYou can modify the program to suit specific needs, such as adjusting the time per load or the water reduction percentage."
