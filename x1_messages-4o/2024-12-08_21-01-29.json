I have a table of top pages, but now I need to incorporate a constraint where each page must only appear once in every 24 hours. Could you help me write a code that randomly displays one of the top pages, ensuring it doesn't repeat within 24 hours of its previous appearance? The solution should be both optimal and operational."

        "content": "Certainly! To tackle this challenge, we can use a combination of a database to track page appearances and some server-side logic to ensure each page is displayed only once every 24 hours. Here's a broad outline using Python with Flask for the server-side logic and SQLite for the database:\n\n1. **Database Setup**: We'll use SQLite to track the last appearance of each page.\n\n2. **Server-side Logic**: Use Flask to handle requests and determine which page to display.\n\n3. **Random Selection with Constraint**: Randomly select a page that hasn't been displayed in the last 24 hours.\n\nHere is a basic implementation:\n\n### Database Setup\n\nFirst, set up a SQLite database with a table to store page information:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS pages (\n    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n    url TEXT NOT NULL,\n    last_displayed TIMESTAMP\n);\n```\n\nYou should populate this table with your HTML learning page URLs.\n\n### Flask Application\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, jsonify\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nimport sqlite3\nimport random\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\ndef get_db_connection():\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')\n    conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row\n    return conn\n\ndef get_eligible_pages():\n    conn = get_db_connection()\n    cur = conn.cursor()\n    twenty_four_hours_ago = datetime.now() - timedelta(hours=24)\n    cur.execute(\n        \"SELECT id, url FROM pages WHERE last_displayed IS NULL OR last_displayed < ?\",\n        (twenty_four_hours_ago,)\n    )\n    pages = cur.fetchall()\n    conn.close()\n    return pages\n\ndef update_last_displayed(page_id):\n    conn = get_db_connection()\n    cur = conn.cursor()\n    cur.execute(\n        \"UPDATE pages SET last_displayed = ? WHERE id = ?\",\n        (datetime.now(), page_id)\n    )\n    conn.commit()\n    conn.close()\n\n@app.route('/get-page')\ndef get_page():\n    pages = get_eligible_pages()\n\n    if not pages:\n        return jsonify({'error': 'No pages available to display at this time.'})\n\n    selected_page = random.choice(pages)\n    update_last_displayed(selected_page['id'])\n\n    return jsonify({'url': selected_page['url']})\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Database Connection**: A function `get_db_connection()` is used to connect to the SQLite database.\n  \n- **Eligible Pages**: `get_eligible_pages()` fetches pages that haven't been displayed in the last 24 hours.\n\n- **Random Selection**: A page is randomly selected from the eligible pages.\n\n- **Update Display Time**: Once a page is selected, its `last_displayed` time is updated.\n\n- **Endpoint**: `/get-page` is the endpoint that returns a randomly selected page URL in JSON format.\n\n### Deployment\n\nEnsure you have your SQLite database set up and populated with your top HTML learning page URLs. Then, run the Flask application and call the `/get-page` endpoint to get a page that satisfies your constraints.\n\nThis solution is optimal for a small to medium number of pages and ensures that each page appears only once within a 24-hour period."
