        "content": "The error you're encountering is because JSON keys must be strings, and in your case, you're using a tuple as a key. To serialize a dictionary with non-string keys, you can convert the keys to strings or use another method to handle such data structures. Here's one way to do it using Python's `json` module, by converting the tuple keys to strings before serialization:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\na = {(1, 2): 'a'}\n\n# Convert the dictionary to a format that JSON can handle\nb = {str(k): v for k, v in a.items()}\n\n# Serialize to JSON\njson_str = json.dumps(b)\nprint(json_str)\n```\n\nWhen you need to deserialize and reconstruct the original dictionary with tuple keys, you can parse the keys back to tuples:\n\n```python\n# Deserialize from JSON\nb = json.loads(json_str)\n\n# Convert the keys back to tuples\na_reconstructed = {eval(k): v for k, v in b.items()}\nprint(a_reconstructed)\n```\n\nNote that using `eval()` can be risky if you're dealing with untrusted data, as it will execute the string as a Python expression. For safer handling, especially in a production environment, consider using a different approach to encode and decode keys, such as using a custom serialization format or using another library like `pickle` (though `pickle` is not JSON and is Python-specific)."
