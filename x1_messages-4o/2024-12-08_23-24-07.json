To solve the brain teaser, you need to determine the total value of two quarters and a dime:\n\n- A quarter is worth 25 cents, so two quarters are worth \\(2 \\times 25 = 50\\) cents.\n- A dime is worth 10 cents.\n\nAdding these together gives you the total value: \\(50 + 10 = 60\\) cents.\n\nHere's a simple Ruby code snippet to calculate this:\n\n```ruby\n# Define the value of a quarter and a dime in cents\nquarter_value = 25\ndime_value = 10\n\n# Calculate the total value of two quarters and one dime\ntotal_cents = (2 * quarter_value) + dime_value\n\n# Output the total value\nputs \"Total value in cents: #{total_cents}\"\n```\n\nRunning this code will output:\n\n```\nTotal value in cents: 60\n```\n\nThis confirms that the total value is 60 cents."
