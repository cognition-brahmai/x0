Currently, I have only six words in the list. The problem is that I don't want to manually write a lot of words into the list. Is there a way to import a large number of random words so that even I don't know what the words are, thereby allowing me to enjoy the game as well? Here is my current code:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nWORDS = (\"python\", \"jumble\", \"easy\", \"difficult\", \"answer\",  \"xylophone\")\nword = random.choice(WORDS)\ncorrect = word\njumble = \"\"\nwhile word:\n    position = random.randrange(len(word))\n    jumble += word[position]\n    word = word[:position] + word[(position + 1):]\nprint(\n\"\"\"\n      Welcome to WORD JUMBLE!!!\n\n      Unscramble the letters to make a word.\n      (press the enter key at prompt to quit)\n      \"\"\"\n      )\nprint(\"The jumble is:\", jumble)\nguess = input(\"Your guess: \")\nwhile guess != correct and guess != \"\":\n    print(\"Sorry, that's not it\")\n    guess = input(\"Your guess: \")\nif guess == correct:\n    print(\"That's it, you guessed it!\\n\")\nprint(\"Thanks for playing\")\n\ninput(\"\\n\\nPress the enter key to exit\")\n```"

        "content": "To enhance your word jumble game with a larger and more varied word list without manually entering them, you can utilize an external library or dataset to import words. One popular library for this purpose is `nltk` (Natural Language Toolkit), which has a comprehensive collection of words. Here's how you can modify your code to use `nltk` for a larger word list:\n\n1. **Install NLTK**: If you haven't already, install the `nltk` library using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install nltk\n   ```\n\n2. **Download the Word List**: You need to download a specific word list from `nltk`. For example, the \"words\" corpus:\n\n   ```python\n   import nltk\n   nltk.download('words')\n   ```\n\n3. **Modify Your Code**: Update your code to use the word list from `nltk`.\n\nHere's how you can integrate it:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.corpus import words\n\n# Download the word list (this is usually done once)\nnltk.download('words')\n\n# Use the nltk words corpus to get a list of words\nWORDS = words.words()\n\n# Select a random word from the list\nword = random.choice(WORDS)\ncorrect = word\njumble = \"\"\n\n# Jumble the word\nwhile word:\n    position = random.randrange(len(word))\n    jumble += word[position]\n    word = word[:position] + word[(position + 1):]\n\n# Game introduction\nprint(\n\"\"\"\n      Welcome to WORD JUMBLE!!!\n\n      Unscramble the letters to make a word.\n      (press the enter key at prompt to quit)\n      \"\"\"\n      )\nprint(\"The jumble is:\", jumble)\n\n# User guesses\nguess = input(\"Your guess: \")\nwhile guess != correct and guess != \"\":\n    print(\"Sorry, that's not it\")\n    guess = input(\"Your guess: \")\n\nif guess == correct:\n    print(\"That's it, you guessed it!\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Thanks for playing\")\n\ninput(\"\\n\\nPress the enter key to exit\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **NLTK Library**: The `nltk` library provides a corpus called \"words\" which contains a large list of English words.\n- **Random Word Selection**: A random word is selected from the `WORDS` list, which now contains thousands of entries.\n- **Jumbling Logic**: The logic for jumbling the word remains the same.\n\nBy using the `nltk` library, you can ensure that the words are varied and that you also enjoy the game without knowing the words beforehand."
