        "content": "To resolve the import issue you're experiencing, you'll need to adjust the way you import modules from a parallel directory in Python. The problem you're encountering is due to the use of relative imports in a script that is not being run as a package. Here are a few solutions you can consider:\n\n### Solution 1: Modify the Python Path\n\nOne approach is to modify the `PYTHONPATH` to include the `src` directory when running your tests. This way, you can use absolute imports:\n\n1. **Update your import statement** in `tests.py` to use an absolute import:\n\n   ```python\n   from src.classes import scheduler, db\n   ```\n\n2. **Set the `PYTHONPATH`** when running your tests. You can do this in a terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   PYTHONPATH=.. python test/tests.py\n   ```\n\n   Alternatively, if you're using a virtual environment or a more complex setup, you can add the `src` directory to your `PYTHONPATH` in your environment configuration.\n\n### Solution 2: Use a Script to Run Tests\n\nCreate a script to run your tests, which sets up the environment correctly:\n\n1. **Create a script `run_tests.py`** at the root of your `project` directory:\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   import os\n\n   # Add the src directory to the path\n   sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'src'))\n\n   # Now import the test module\n   from test.tests import scheduler, db\n\n   # Execute your tests\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       # Your test execution logic here\n       pass\n   ```\n\n2. **Run your script** using Python:\n\n   ```bash\n   python run_tests.py\n   ```\n\n### Solution 3: Use a Testing Framework\n\nUse a testing framework like `pytest` which handles module imports more gracefully when executed from the root of the project:\n\n1. **Install pytest** if you haven't already:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pytest\n   ```\n\n2. **Run pytest** from the root directory of your project:\n\n   ```bash\n   pytest --rootdir=.\n   ```\n\n`pytest` automatically adds the root directory to the `PYTHONPATH`, allowing you to use absolute imports in your test files.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nChoose the solution that best fits your development environment and workflow. If you're frequently encountering such import issues, consider using a framework like `pytest`, as it simplifies the testing process and module imports significantly."
