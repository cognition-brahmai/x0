For model 2, I got a Precision of 85.1, Recall of 98.73, F1 score of 91.41, and AUC of 71.69. My primary objective is to predict the positive cases correctly and reduce the number of False Negative cases (FN). Should I use the F1 score to choose Model 1 or use AUC to choose Model 2?"

        "content": "Considering your primary objective is to predict positive cases correctly and reduce the number of False Negatives (FN), you should focus on metrics that closely align with this goal.\n\n1. **Recall** is crucial in your scenario because it measures the ability of the model to identify all relevant instances (i.e., positive cases). A higher recall indicates fewer false negatives. Between the two models, Model 1 has a slightly higher recall (99.04) compared to Model 2 (98.73).\n\n2. **F1 Score** is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two. Model 1 has a slightly higher F1 score (91.55) than Model 2 (91.41), suggesting it maintains a better balance between precision and recall.\n\n3. **AUC (Area Under the Curve)** is a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between classes. It provides an aggregate measure of performance across all classification thresholds. Model 2 has a higher AUC (71.69) compared to Model 1 (69.94), indicating it may better distinguish between positive and negative classes overall.\n\nGiven your primary objective is to reduce false negatives, you should prioritize recall. In this case, Model 1, with a higher recall and F1 score, would be more aligned with your goal of correctly predicting positive cases and minimizing false negatives. Therefore, I would recommend choosing Model 1."
