Select \"Organize Imports\" and click on \"Restore Defaults\".\n\n3. **Check Java Editor Settings:**\n   - Make sure your file is being recognized as a Java source file. Right-click the file in the Project Explorer, select `Open With`, and ensure \"Java Editor\" is selected.\n\n4. **Check Project Build Path:**\n   - Ensure your project's build path is correctly set up.\n   - Right-click on your project, select `Properties`, then `Java Build Path`, and make sure all necessary libraries and source folders are included.\n\n5. **Check for Errors:**\n   - Look for syntax errors in your Java file that might be preventing Eclipse from organizing imports. Fix any errors and try again.\n\n6. **Eclipse Updates and Plugins:**\n   - Make sure you are using the latest version of Eclipse. Sometimes updating can fix bugs.\n   - If you have recently installed any new plugins, try disabling them one by one to see if they are causing the issue.\n\n7. **Workspace Refresh:**\n   - Sometimes refreshing the workspace can solve unexpected issues. Go to `File` > `Refresh` or press `F5`.\n\n8. **Eclipse Reinstallation:**\n   - As a last resort, try reinstalling Eclipse. Make sure to back up your workspace and important settings before doing so.\n\nBy trying these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with the `Ctrl+Shift+O` shortcut in Eclipse for Java files."
