        "content": "When dealing with Python imports, especially in a project with a nested directory structure, you might encounter issues if your directories are not recognized as packages. To ensure that Python recognizes your directories as packages, make sure each directory contains an `__init__.py` file (it can be an empty file).\n\nHere's a possible solution to your issue:\n\n1. **Ensure `__init__.py` Files Exist**: Make sure each directory has an `__init__.py` file, like so:\n\n    ```\n    application\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 app\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 folder\n    \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n    \u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 file.py\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 app2\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 some_folder\n            \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n            \u2514\u2500\u2500 some_file.py\n    ```\n\n2. **Adjust Your Import Statement**: If the `application` directory is your project's root directory, you should be able to use relative imports within `some_file.py` like this:\n\n    ```python\n    from app.folder.file import func_name\n    ```\n\n3. **Set the Python Path**: If you are running the script directly and the imports are still causing issues, you may need to set the Python path to include the root directory of your project. You can do this by running the script with the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable set, for example:\n\n    On Unix/Mac:\n    ```bash\n    PYTHONPATH=/path/to/application python app2/some_folder/some_file.py\n    ```\n\n    On Windows:\n    ```bash\n    set PYTHONPATH=\\path\\to\\application\n    python app2\\some_folder\\some_file.py\n    ```\n\n4. **Use Absolute Imports**: If you are running the script from outside of the `application` directory, ensure you are using the correct absolute import path.\n\n5. **Check Your Execution Context**: Make sure you are executing your script from the root directory of the project. This is crucial for relative imports to work correctly.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to import `func_name` from `file.py` into `some_file.py` successfully."
