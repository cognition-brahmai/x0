I can get a working progress bar but I'm having trouble gathering results using `as_completed()`. I have seen examples suggesting a pattern using `async def` definitions, but it seems to be incompatible with Python 3.5:\n\n```python\nfor f in tqdm.tqdm(asyncio.as_completed(tasks), total=len(coros)):\n    yield from f\n```\n\nThe async code without the progress bar is working fine:\n\n```python\ndef async_classify(records):\n\n    async def fetch(session, name, sequence):\n        url = 'https://app.example.com/api/v0/search'\n        payload = {'sequence': str(sequence)}\n        async with session.post(url, data=payload) as response:\n            return name, await response.json()\n\n    async def loop():\n        auth = aiohttp.BasicAuth(api_key)\n        conn = aiohttp.TCPConnector(limit=100)\n        with aiohttp.ClientSession(auth=auth, connector=conn) as session:\n            tasks = [fetch(session, record.id, record.seq) for record in records]\n            responses = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)    \n        return OrderedDict(responses)\n```\n\nHowever, this is my unsuccessful attempt at modifying `loop()`:\n\n```python\nasync def loop():\n    auth = aiohttp.BasicAuth(api_key)\n    conn = aiohttp.TCPConnector(limit=100)\n    with aiohttp.ClientSession(auth=auth, connector=conn) as session:\n        tasks = [fetch(session, record.id, record.seq) for record in records]\n        for f in tqdm.tqdm(asyncio.as_completed(tasks), total=len(tasks)):\n            await f\n        responses = await asyncio.gather(f)\n        print(responses)\n```\n\nHow can I correctly integrate the tqdm progress bar with asyncio aiohttp?"

        "content": "To integrate the `tqdm` progress bar with `aiohttp` in an asynchronous context using Python 3.5, you need to ensure that you're correctly awaiting the completion of each task while updating the progress bar. The issue in your current approach is that you're not collecting the results properly and you are trying to gather results with `asyncio.gather(f)` after the loop, which only contains the last completed task.\n\nHere's how you can modify your `loop()` function to correctly integrate `tqdm` with `asyncio.as_completed()`:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport aiohttp\nimport tqdm\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\n\nasync def async_classify(records, api_key):\n    async def fetch(session, name, sequence):\n        url = 'https://app.example.com/api/v0/search'\n        payload = {'sequence': str(sequence)}\n        async with session.post(url, data=payload) as response:\n            return name, await response.json()\n\n    async def loop():\n        auth = aiohttp.BasicAuth(api_key)\n        conn = aiohttp.TCPConnector(limit=100)\n\n        # Use an async context manager for aiohttp.ClientSession\n        async with aiohttp.ClientSession(auth=auth, connector=conn) as session:\n            tasks = [fetch(session, record.id, record.seq) for record in records]\n            responses = []\n\n            # Iterate over tasks as they complete\n            for f in tqdm.tqdm(asyncio.as_completed(tasks), total=len(tasks)):\n                result = await f  # Await the result of the completed task\n                responses.append(result)\n\n        return OrderedDict(responses)\n\n    return await loop()\n\n# Example usage\n# results = asyncio.run(async_classify(records, api_key))  # Python 3.7+ use asyncio.run\n# For Python 3.5, you would use:\n# loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n# results = loop.run_until_complete(async_classify(records, api_key))\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Async Context Manager**: Use `async with` for `aiohttp.ClientSession` to ensure proper cleanup of resources.\n2. **Iterate with `asyncio.as_completed`**: This allows you to process tasks as they complete, which is useful for updating progress bars.\n3. **Collect Results**: Append the result of each completed task to a list.\n\nThis solution will properly integrate the progress bar with your asynchronous HTTP requests and collect the results as they are completed, updating the progress bar accordingly."
