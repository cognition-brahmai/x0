I've tried using numpy.degrees() and numpy.rad2deg() already but I'm not getting the results I expect. Here is the code I've tried:\n\n```python\nnumpy.sin(90)\nnumpy.degrees(numpy.sin(90))\n```\n\nBoth return ~ 0.894 and ~ 51.2 respectively."

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that the `numpy.sin()` function expects the input angle to be in radians, not degrees. When you pass 90 to `numpy.sin()`, it interprets it as 90 radians, not 90 degrees.\n\nTo calculate the sine of an angle given in degrees, you should first convert the angle from degrees to radians using `numpy.radians()`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Angle in degrees\nangle_degrees = 90\n\n# Convert the angle from degrees to radians\nangle_radians = np.radians(angle_degrees)\n\n# Calculate the sine of the angle in radians\nsine_value = np.sin(angle_radians)\n\nprint(sine_value)  # This should output 1.0\n```\n\nIn this example, `np.radians()` converts 90 degrees to radians, and `np.sin()` then calculates the sine of that angle in radians.\n\nRemember, if you want to calculate angles of refraction or any trigonometric function based on angles in degrees, always convert degrees to radians first before using trigonometric functions in NumPy."
