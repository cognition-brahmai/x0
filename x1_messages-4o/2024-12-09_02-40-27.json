I would like to create a simple one-liner that will sum up the elements in the same position within each tuple and store the results in a new list or tuple, `r`, such that `r = (25, 20)` or `r = [25, 20]`. The result should be equivalent to running the following loop:\n\n```python\nr = [0, 0]\nfor t in l:\n  r[0]+=t[0]\n  r[1]+=t[1]\n```\n\nIs there an efficient way to achieve this in Python?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this using the `zip` function along with `sum` and a list comprehension. Here's a one-liner that accomplishes the task:\n\n```python\nr = tuple(sum(x) for x in zip(*l))\n```\n\nOr, if you prefer the result in a list instead of a tuple:\n\n```python\nr = [sum(x) for x in zip(*l)]\n```\n\nHere's a brief explanation of how it works:\n- `zip(*l)` transposes the list of tuples `l`, effectively separating the elements by their positions.\n- `sum(x)` computes the sum of each group of elements.\n- The list comprehension `[sum(x) for x in zip(*l)]` or tuple comprehension `tuple(sum(x) for x in zip(*l))` gathers the sums into a list or tuple."
