The curly braces `{{ }}` are used for expression evaluation in the template output, but when setting a variable, you don't need them. Here's how you can set `active_link` to the value of `recordtype`:\n\n```jinja\n{% set active_link = recordtype %}\n```\n\nThis way, `active_link` will be assigned the value of `recordtype`. You can then use `active_link` in your template to help identify which link is active in your submenu. If you need to perform any logic or checks, ensure they are done outside the variable assignment."
