        "content": "In Python, using the `lxml` library, you can obtain the XPath to a specific element in an HTML document by leveraging the `getpath` method from the `lxml.etree.ElementTree` class. Here's how you can achieve a similar result to the Ruby code you've provided:\n\n```python\nfrom lxml import etree, html\n\n# Sample HTML content\nhtml_content = \"\"\"\n<html>\n    <body>\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Sample text</p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </body>\n</html>\n\"\"\"\n\n# Parse the HTML content\ntree = html.fromstring(html_content)\n\n# Iterate over all text nodes and print their XPath\nfor text_node in tree.xpath('//text()'):\n    # Get the element containing this text node\n    parent_element = text_node.getparent()\n    \n    # Get the full XPath to the parent element\n    path = tree.getroottree().getpath(parent_element)\n    \n    # Determine the index of the text node among its siblings\n    index = parent_element.xpath('count(preceding-sibling::text())') + 1\n    full_path = f\"{path}/text()[{int(index)}]\"\n    \n    print(full_path)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Parsing the HTML:** We use `html.fromstring` to parse the HTML content and create an element tree.\n2. **Finding Text Nodes:** We iterate over all text nodes using `tree.xpath('//text()')`.\n3. **Getting Parent Element:** For each text node, we find its parent element using `text_node.getparent()`.\n4. **Finding the XPath:** We use `tree.getroottree().getpath(parent_element)` to get the XPath of the parent element.\n5. **Text Node Index:** We calculate the index of the text node among its siblings using XPath's `count(preceding-sibling::text())`.\n6. **Constructing Full XPath:** Finally, we construct the full XPath to the text node by appending `/text()[index]` to the parent's XPath.\n\nThis will give you the complete XPath to each text node in the HTML document, similar to the behavior in Ruby's Nokogiri."
