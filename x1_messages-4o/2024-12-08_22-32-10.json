You have a set of sales data for the past three months, but unfortunately, the data is encrypted and you need to decode it in order to calculate the total sales for each month.\nHere is the encrypted sales data for the past three months:\n- 01-Jan-2021: $x\n- 02-Jan-2021: $y\n- 03-Jan-2021: $z\n- 01-Feb-2021: $2x\n- 02-Feb-2021: $2y\n- 03-Feb-2021: $2z\n- 01-Mar-2021: $3x\n- 02-Mar-2021: $3y\n- 03-Mar-2021: $3z\nUsing your logic and reasoning skills, can you decode the sales data and calculate the total sales for each month? Remember, the value of x, y, and z are unknown and you need to figure them out.\nOnce you have decoded the sales data and calculated the total sales for each month, please provide the decoding process and the formula you used to calculate the total sales.\nHint: You can use the fact that the sales for each day of February is twice the sales for the corresponding day of January, and the sales for each day of March is three times the sales for the corresponding day of January."

        "content": "To decode the sales data, let's analyze the relationship between the sales for each month. The sales for each day in February are twice the sales of the corresponding day in January, and the sales for each day in March are three times the sales of the corresponding day in January. From this, we can derive the following relationships:\n\n1. January Sales:\n   - 01-Jan-2021: $x\n   - 02-Jan-2021: $y\n   - 03-Jan-2021: $z\n\n2. February Sales:\n   - 01-Feb-2021: $2x\n   - 02-Feb-2021: $2y\n   - 03-Feb-2021: $2z\n\n3. March Sales:\n   - 01-Mar-2021: $3x\n   - 02-Mar-2021: $3y\n   - 03-Mar-2021: $3z\n\nBased on these relationships, we can write the total sales for each month as follows:\n\n- **Total Sales for January**: \n  \\[\n  S_{\\text{Jan}} = x + y + z\n  \\]\n\n- **Total Sales for February**: \n  \\[\n  S_{\\text{Feb}} = 2x + 2y + 2z = 2(x + y + z)\n  \\]\n\n- **Total Sales for March**: \n  \\[\n  S_{\\text{Mar}} = 3x + 3y + 3z = 3(x + y + z)\n  \\]\n\nFrom the equations above, we can see that the total sales for February is twice that of January, and the total sales for March is three times that of January. Therefore:\n\n- \\( S_{\\text{Feb}} = 2 \\times S_{\\text{Jan}} \\)\n- \\( S_{\\text{Mar}} = 3 \\times S_{\\text{Jan}} \\)\n\nThus, the formula to calculate the total sales for each month is based on the total sales for January. Once you have the values of \\( x, y, \\) and \\( z \\), you can compute the total sales using the equations provided. Without the specific values for \\( x, y, \\) and \\( z \\), we can't determine the exact sales figures, but we can express February's and March's sales in terms of January's sales."
