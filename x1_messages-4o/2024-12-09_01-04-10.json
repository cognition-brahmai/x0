I was successful in installing pipenv as running \"pip install --user pipenv\" returned the message \"Successfully installed pipenv-5.3.3\". However, when I try to install the 'requests' package using pipenv by running \"pipenv install requests\", I get an error message that says \"'pipenv' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file\". I tried resolving this by adding the path \"C:\\Users\\Robert\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python\\Python35\\site-packages\" to my Windows path environment variable, but the error persists. How can I install the 'requests' package using pipenv on Windows?"

        "content": "It seems like the issue is related to the `pipenv` command not being recognized in your command prompt. This is often due to the path to the `pipenv` executable not being included in your system's PATH environment variable. Here\u2019s how you can resolve this:\n\n1. **Locate the Pipenv Executable Path:**\n   First, you need to find where `pipenv` is installed. Since you used the `--user` flag with `pip install`, it should be located in a path similar to:\n   ```\n   C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python\\PythonXX\\Scripts\n   ```\n   Replace `YourUsername` with your actual username and `PythonXX` with your Python version (like Python35 or Python39).\n\n2. **Add to PATH Environment Variable:**\n   Once you locate the correct path, add it to your system's PATH environment variable:\n   - Press `Win + R`, type `sysdm.cpl`, and press Enter.\n   - Go to the \"Advanced\" tab and click on \"Environment Variables\".\n   - Under \"System variables\", find and select the \"Path\" variable, and click \"Edit\".\n   - Click \"New\" and paste the path to the `Scripts` directory you found earlier.\n   - Click \"OK\" to close all dialogs.\n\n3. **Verify the Setup:**\n   Open a new command prompt (you need to open a new one for changes to take effect) and type:\n   ```\n   pipenv --version\n   ```\n   This should display the version of `pipenv` installed, confirming it's recognized.\n\n4. **Install the `requests` Package:**\n   Now you should be able to install the `requests` package using:\n   ```\n   pipenv install requests\n   ```\n\nIf you still encounter issues, consider reinstalling `pipenv` using `pip` without the `--user` flag or using a virtual environment specifically for your project. You can also try installing it via `Chocolatey`, a package manager for Windows, by running:\n```\nchoco install pipenv\n```\nin an elevated command prompt (run as administrator). This might help bypass the path issues."
