For example, given the string \"a,b,c,d\", I would like to split it into 'a,b,c' and 'd' using the last comma as the delimiter. I'm looking for a method similar to 'mysplit' where the second argument can be used to specify the occurrence of the delimiter from the end. How can I accomplish this?"

        "content": "To split a string based on the last occurrence of a delimiter in Python, you can use the `rsplit` method. This method splits a string starting from the right and allows you to specify the maximum number of splits. Here's how you can use `rsplit` to achieve your goal:\n\n```python\ndef mysplit(string, delimiter, occurrence_from_end=1):\n    # Use rsplit to split from the right, with occurrence_from_end specifying the number of splits\n    parts = string.rsplit(delimiter, occurrence_from_end)\n    return delimiter.join(parts[:-1]), parts[-1]\n\n# Example usage\nstring = \"a,b,c,d\"\nfirst_part, last_part = mysplit(string, ',', 1)\nprint(first_part)  # Output: \"a,b,c\"\nprint(last_part)   # Output: \"d\"\n```\n\nIn this example, `rsplit` is used with the delimiter `,` and the maximum number of splits set to `1`, which splits the string from the right at the last occurrence of the comma. The function `mysplit` returns a tuple containing the portion before the last delimiter and the portion after it."
