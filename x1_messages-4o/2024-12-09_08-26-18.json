However, the size of the image saved is the same size as the image that is displayed when I use `pylab.show()`. Given the amount of data in my plot, I need to maximize the window to see the plot correctly and avoid xlabel tickers overlapping each other. Is there a way to programmatically maximize the window before saving the image to a file? Currently, I am only able to get the default window size image, which results in the x-axis labels overlapping."

        "content": "To programmatically specify the size of your plot and ensure that it appears correctly without overlapping labels, you can set the figure size using the `figsize` parameter in `matplotlib.pyplot.figure()` before plotting your data. This allows you to control the dimensions of the plot when it is saved to a file, independent of how it is displayed on your screen.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Example data\nx = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)\ny = np.sin(x)\n\n# Create a figure with a specified size\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 6))  # width=12, height=6 in inches\n\n# Plot your data\nax.plot(x, y)\n\n# Customize the plot if needed\nax.set_xlabel('X-axis Label')\nax.set_ylabel('Y-axis Label')\nax.set_title('Plot Title')\n\n# Adjust the layout to prevent overlapping\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n# Save the figure to a file\nplt.savefig('your_image_name.png')\n\n# Optionally, display the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `figsize=(12, 6)` sets the width to 12 inches and the height to 6 inches. You can adjust these values to fit your needs.\n- `plt.tight_layout()` automatically adjusts the subplot parameters to give specified padding and prevent overlapping labels.\n\nThis way, you ensure that the saved image has the dimensions you want, and overlapping issues are minimized."
