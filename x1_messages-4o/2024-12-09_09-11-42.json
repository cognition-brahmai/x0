Here's how you can write the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Nationality, COUNT(*) AS StudentCount\nFROM Students\nGROUP BY Nationality;\n```\n\nThis query selects the \"Nationality\" column and counts the number of entries (students) for each distinct nationality. The results will be grouped by the \"Nationality\" column, and `COUNT(*)` will provide the total count of students for each nationality. The `AS StudentCount` part is an alias to name the resulting count column, making the output more readable."
