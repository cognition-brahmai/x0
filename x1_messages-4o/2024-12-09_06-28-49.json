        "content": "In modern Python, the `print >>f, \"hi there\"` syntax is indeed deprecated and no longer available in Python 3. Instead, you should use the `open()` function along with the `with` statement to handle file operations, which ensures that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes. Here's how you can write a line to a file:\n\n```python\nwith open('filename.txt', 'w') as f:\n    f.write(\"hi there\\n\")\n```\n\n- Use `open('filename.txt', 'w')` to open a file in write mode. If the file does not exist, it will be created. If it does exist, the file will be truncated, meaning its content will be erased.\n- `f.write(\"hi there\\n\")` writes the string \"hi there\" followed by a newline character to the file.\n\nRegarding line breaks, Python's `open()` function handles line endings for you when you open a file in text mode (the default mode). It automatically translates `\"\\n\"` to the appropriate line ending for the operating system. So, you should use `\"\\n\"` universally in your code.\n\nIf you explicitly need `\"\\r\\n\"` line endings, such as when working with certain network protocols or file formats, you can open the file in binary mode and manually handle the line endings:\n\n```python\nwith open('filename.txt', 'wb') as f:\n    f.write(b\"hi there\\r\\n\")\n```\n\nIn this case, opening the file with `'wb'` specifies binary write mode, and you must provide a bytes-like object (hence the `b` prefix before the string)."
