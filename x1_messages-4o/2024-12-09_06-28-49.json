        "content": "I have been reading about the `@abstractmethod` decorator in Python and have tried testing it out. According to the documentation, a class with a metaclass derived from `ABCMeta` cannot be instantiated unless all of its abstract methods and properties are overridden. I created an abstract class with an abstract method and a concrete class that inherits from the abstract class but does not override the abstract method. I was expecting to get an exception when I try to instantiate the concrete class and call the abstract method, but I did not. Instead, when I type `c.abstractMethod`, I get a bound method. Why am I not getting an exception about the concrete class failing to implement the abstract methods, as the documentation suggests?\n\nHere is the code I used:\n\n```python\nimport abc\n\nclass AbstractClass(object):\n  __metaclass__ = abc.ABCMeta\n\n  @abc.abstractmethod\n  def abstractMethod(self):\n    return\n\nclass ConcreteClass(AbstractClass):\n  def __init__(self):\n    self.me = \"me\"\n\nc = ConcreteClass()\nc.abstractMethod()\n```"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is due to a subtle issue in your code related to how you've defined the metaclass in Python 2.x syntax. Let's address this and correct it for Python 3.x, which is likely what you're aiming to use.\n\nIn Python 3.x, the correct way to define an abstract base class using `ABCMeta` is by using the `metaclass` keyword argument in the class definition. Your current code uses the Python 2.x style, which doesn't properly apply the metaclass.\n\nHere's how you can define the abstract class using Python 3.x syntax:\n\n```python\nimport abc\n\nclass AbstractClass(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):\n    @abc.abstractmethod\n    def abstractMethod(self):\n        pass\n\nclass ConcreteClass(AbstractClass):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.me = \"me\"\n\n# Attempting to instantiate ConcreteClass will raise an error now\nc = ConcreteClass()\nc.abstractMethod()\n```\n\nWith this corrected code, when you try to instantiate `ConcreteClass`, Python will raise a `TypeError`, indicating that you can't instantiate the class because it hasn't implemented all the abstract methods. This is the expected behavior when using `ABCMeta` correctly in Python 3.x. \n\nMake sure you're running this on a Python 3.x environment for it to work as intended. If you're still using Python 2.x, consider transitioning to Python 3.x, as Python 2.x has reached its end of life and does not receive updates or support."
