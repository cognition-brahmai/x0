Below is a step-by-step guide along with a sample code to help you get started:\n\n1. **Set Up Your Development Environment**:\n   - Ensure you have Visual Studio or any other C# compatible IDE installed.\n\n2. **Create a New Console Application**:\n   - Open Visual Studio.\n   - Create a new project by selecting \"Console App\" template for C#.\n\n3. **Write the Code**:\n   - Replace the contents of `Program.cs` with the following code:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass Calculator\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        bool continueCalculation = true;\n        \n        while (continueCalculation)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Simple Calculator\");\n            Console.WriteLine(\"-----------------\");\n            Console.Write(\"Enter the first number: \");\n            double num1 = Convert.ToDouble(Console.ReadLine());\n\n            Console.Write(\"Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): \");\n            char operation = Console.ReadLine()[0];\n\n            Console.Write(\"Enter the second number: \");\n            double num2 = Convert.ToDouble(Console.ReadLine());\n\n            double result = 0;\n\n            switch (operation)\n            {\n                case '+':\n                    result = num1 + num2;\n                    break;\n                case '-':\n                    result = num1 - num2;\n                    break;\n                case '*':\n                    result = num1 * num2;\n                    break;\n                case '/':\n                    if (num2 != 0)\n                    {\n                        result = num1 / num2;\n                    }\n                    else\n                    {\n                        Console.WriteLine(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\");\n                        continue;\n                    }\n                    break;\n                default:\n                    Console.WriteLine(\"Error: Invalid operator.\");\n                    continue;\n            }\n\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Result: {result}\");\n\n            Console.Write(\"Do you want to perform another calculation? (y/n): \");\n            continueCalculation = Console.ReadLine().ToLower() == \"y\";\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n4. **Run the Program**:\n   - Press `F5` or click the \"Start\" button in Visual Studio to run your program.\n\n5. **Use the Calculator**:\n   - Follow the on-screen prompts to enter numbers and operations.\n   - After each calculation, you'll be asked if you want to perform another calculation.\n\n### Code Explanation:\n\n- **Main Method**: The entry point of the program where it continuously runs in a loop allowing multiple calculations.\n- **User Input**: The program takes input for the two numbers and the operation from the user.\n- **Switch Statement**: It determines which arithmetic operation to perform based on the operator provided by the user.\n- **Division Check**: It includes a check to prevent division by zero, which would otherwise cause a runtime error.\n- **Repeat Option**: After completing a calculation, the user is prompted to either continue or exit the program.\n\nThis basic calculator serves as a great starting point for learning C#. As you become more familiar with the language, you might consider adding more features, such as handling invalid inputs more robustly, supporting more operations, or creating a graphical user interface."
