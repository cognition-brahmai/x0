        "content": "I am working on a Python project with another developer and we are having a disagreement about whether to use `PYTHONPATH` or `sys.path` to allow Python to find a Python package in a user (development) directory. The structure of our project is as follows:\n```\nProject\n    setup.py\n    package\n        __init__.py\n        lib.py\n        script.py\n```\nWhen running script.py, we need to import the module `package.lib`. This works fine when the package is installed in site-packages, but when working from a user directory, we need to do something different. My solution is to set my `PYTHONPATH` to include `~/Project`. However, the other developer suggests adding `sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))` at the beginning of script.py so that Python can find the local copy of `package.lib`. I believe this is not a good idea, as this line seems only beneficial for developers or people running from a local copy, but I can't exactly articulate why it's not a good practice. Should we use `PYTHONPATH`, `sys.path`, or are both methods fine?"

It allows developers to configure their environments without altering the code.\n  \n- **For Deployment**: If you need a more self-contained solution for deployment scenarios where you cannot rely on the environment, then using `sys.path` might be necessary. However, this should be approached with caution and possibly limited to a specific script designed for this purpose.\n\nIn your case, since you are in a development environment, `PYTHONPATH` is likely the better option. It keeps your codebase clean and focuses on its primary functionality, allowing developers to configure their own environments as needed. If you choose to modify `sys.path`, consider isolating this logic in a separate script or within a specific development configuration to avoid cluttering your main application logic."
