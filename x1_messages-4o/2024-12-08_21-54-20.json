        "content": "To perform database queries from MATLAB, you typically interact with the database using MATLAB's Database Toolbox rather than using shell commands directly. However, if you are looking to execute an SQL query from MATLAB, you can make use of the `exec` function after establishing a database connection.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Establish a Database Connection**: First, you need to connect to your database using the `database` function. You'll need details like the database name, username, password, and the JDBC driver.\n\n2. **Execute the SQL Query**: Use the `exec` function to run your SQL query.\n\n3. **Fetch and Display the Results**: You can use the `fetch` function to get the results and then display them accordingly.\n\nHere\u2019s a sample MATLAB code demonstrating this process:\n\n```matlab\n% Define database connection parameters\ndatasource = 'yourDataSourceName'; % name of the data source\nusername = 'yourUsername';\npassword = 'yourPassword';\n\n% Create a database connection\nconn = database(datasource, username, password);\n\n% Check if the connection is successful\nif isopen(conn)\n    % Define the SQL query\n    sqlquery = 'SELECT name, balance FROM customer_info WHERE balance > 500';\n\n    % Execute the query\n    curs = exec(conn, sqlquery);\n\n    % Fetch the results\n    curs = fetch(curs);\n\n    % Display the results\n    data = curs.Data;\n    disp(data);\n\n    % Close the cursor and the connection\n    close(curs);\n    close(conn);\nelse\n    error('Failed to connect to the database.');\nend\n```\n\nReplace `'yourDataSourceName'`, `'yourUsername'`, and `'yourPassword'` with your actual database connection details. Make sure the Database Toolbox is installed and configured correctly in your MATLAB environment.\n\nThis code connects to the database, executes the SQL query, fetches the results, and then displays them. If you encounter any issues, ensure your database connection details are correct and that the database is accessible from your MATLAB environment."
