I am using Windows 10, geckodriver 0.21.0, and Python 3.7. A part of my script is working fine, but the system aborts the connection when it reaches a certain part of my script where I create a new webdriver instance. The error message is as follows:\n\n<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"C:\\Users\\Anthony\\Desktop\\test.py\", line 271, in &lt;module&gt;\n    backers_profile = container.find_elements_by_xpath('./*/div[@class=\"campaignBackers-pledge-backer-details\"]/a')\n...\nConnectionAbortedError: [WinError 10053] An established connection was aborted by the software in your host machine\n</code></pre>\n\nI also have a `create_webdriver_instance` function which creates instances of WebDriver. What could be causing the connection to abort?"

        "content": "The `ConnectionAbortedError: [WinError 10053]` can be caused by several factors when dealing with web drivers like geckodriver. Here are some potential causes and solutions you can consider:\n\n1. **Network Issues**: \n   - Ensure your internet connection is stable. Unstable connections can lead to such errors.\n   - Check if any firewall or antivirus software is interfering with the connection. Try temporarily disabling them to see if the issue persists.\n\n2. **Geckodriver Version**:\n   - Your geckodriver (0.21.0) might be outdated. Consider updating to the latest version. As of your training data, geckodriver has newer releases that might have fixes for such bugs.\n\n3. **Firefox Version Compatibility**:\n   - Ensure that the version of Firefox you are using is compatible with the geckodriver version. Sometimes, a mismatch can cause unexpected errors.\n\n4. **Webdriver Timeout Settings**:\n   - Set appropriate timeouts for your webdriver. For example, you can set page load timeout or script timeout to see if that helps manage the connection better. Example:\n     ```python\n     driver.set_page_load_timeout(30)\n     driver.set_script_timeout(30)\n     ```\n\n5. **Resource Limitations**:\n   - Check if your system is running out of resources (memory, CPU) when opening multiple webdriver instances. Try reducing the number of instances or optimizing your code to release resources when they are no longer needed.\n\n6. **Nested Webdriver Instances**:\n   - If you are opening multiple webdriver instances, ensure each instance is properly managed and closed when not needed. Unclosed instances could lead to resource exhaustion.\n\n7. **Error Handling**:\n   - Implement robust error handling to catch and manage exceptions. This can help prevent abrupt termination of your script.\n\n8. **Improper Shutdown**:\n   - Ensure that you are properly closing the webdriver instance with `driver.quit()` whenever it's no longer needed.\n\n9. **Debugging**:\n   - Add logging to your script to identify exactly where the connection is being aborted. This might help pinpoint the problem.\n\nIf the problem persists, consider running a minimal version of your script to isolate the issue. If the error still occurs, it might be helpful to consult the latest documentation or reach out to forums for more specific troubleshooting based on updated versions of the tools you are using."
