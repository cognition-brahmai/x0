When I attempt to manually save my work via File>>Save and Checkpoint, there are no changes made. Additionally, there is a yellow box labeled \"forbidden\" next to my Python 2 kernel name that disappears upon being clicked, though I'm not sure if this is related to the autosave issue. Can anyone help me resolve the autosave failure in iPython 3/Jupyter?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing with Jupyter Notebook's autosave function and the \"forbidden\" message could be due to several factors. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and hopefully resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Check Permissions:**\n   - Ensure that you have the necessary read and write permissions for the directory where your notebook is located. If not, you might need to change the permissions or move the notebook to a directory where you have proper access.\n\n2. **Kernel and Notebook Extensions:**\n   - Sometimes, extensions or the kernel itself might be causing issues. Try restarting the kernel and see if the problem persists.\n   - You can also disable any Jupyter Notebook extensions temporarily to see if they are causing the issue.\n\n3. **Update Jupyter Notebook:**\n   - Ensure that you are using the latest version of Jupyter Notebook. You can update it by running:\n     ```bash\n     pip install --upgrade notebook\n     ```\n   - This might resolve any bugs present in the version you are using.\n\n4. **Browser Cache:**\n   - Clear your browser cache or try accessing the notebook from a different browser to rule out browser-related issues.\n\n5. **Check Jupyter Logs:**\n   - Check the terminal or command prompt where you started Jupyter Notebook for any error messages that might give you more insight into what's going wrong.\n\n6. **Configuration Files:**\n   - Check your Jupyter configuration files (usually located in `~/.jupyter` on Unix-based systems or the equivalent on Windows) for any settings that might affect autosave or permissions.\n\n7. **Network Issues:**\n   - If you are running Jupyter Notebook on a remote server, ensure there are no network issues that might be affecting the save functionality.\n\n8. **Alternative Save Methods:**\n   - As a temporary workaround, you can manually save your work by exporting the notebook as a `.ipynb` file through the \"File\" menu and selecting \"Download as.\"\n\nIf none of these steps resolve your issue, consider looking for recent issues on Jupyter's GitHub repository or reaching out to their community for more specialized support."
