I include the Tracer in my scripts for debugging purposes when run from IPython, but it throws an error if I run the script from the command line. I am looking for a way to check if the script is being run from IPython and only then import the Tracer."

        "content": "To conditionally import `Tracer` from `IPython.Debugger` based on whether your script is being run from an IPython environment, you can use a try-except block to check if IPython is available. Below is an example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Try to get the IPython shell if it exists\n    from IPython import get_ipython\n    ipython_shell = get_ipython()\n\n    # Check if the shell is an instance of ZMQInteractiveShell (i.e., Jupyter/IPython)\n    if ipython_shell is not None and 'IPKernelApp' in ipython_shell.config:\n        # Import Tracer if running in IPython\n        from IPython.Debugger import Tracer\n        tracer_available = True\n    else:\n        tracer_available = False\n\nexcept ImportError:\n    # If IPython is not installed, we can't use Tracer\n    tracer_available = False\n\n# Use the tracer in your script if it is available\nif tracer_available:\n    # Example usage of Tracer\n    tracer = Tracer()\n    # You can then use tracer() to set a trace point\n    # Example: tracer()  # Uncomment this line to start tracing\nelse:\n    print(\"Tracer is not available. Running outside of IPython.\")\n\n# Rest of your script\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Import IPython**: First, try to import `get_ipython` from the `IPython` module. This function returns the active IPython shell object or `None` if not running in IPython.\n\n2. **Check the Shell**: Use `get_ipython()` to check if you are in an IPython environment. Specifically, check for the presence of `'IPKernelApp'` in the shell configuration to ensure it's a Jupyter or IPython environment.\n\n3. **Handle ImportError**: If importing IPython fails (i.e., `ImportError` is raised), it indicates that you are not in an IPython environment, so `Tracer` cannot be used.\n\n4. **Conditional Logic**: Set a flag `tracer_available` to indicate whether `Tracer` can be used. Use this flag to conditionally execute any debugging code that requires `Tracer`.\n\nThis approach ensures that your script can be run both from IPython and the command line without errors related to the conditional import of `Tracer`."
