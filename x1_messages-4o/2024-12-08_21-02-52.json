Let's assume the HR database contains three columns: \"employee name\", \"certification status\", and \"training course\". You need to provide a query that can be used to update the certification status of a particular employee after they have finished a training course. However, there are certain conditions that need to be met before updating the database. Can you identify those conditions and incorporate them into your query? Good luck!"

        "content": "To update an employee's certification status in the HR database after they finish a training course, we need to consider the following conditions:\n\n1. The employee must have completed the training course.\n2. The completion needs to be verified.\n3. The certification status should be updated only if the current status is not already up-to-date.\n\nHere is a SQL query that incorporates these conditions:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE hr_database\nSET certification_status = 'Certified'\nWHERE employee_name = 'Employee_Name'\nAND training_course = 'Training_Course_Name'\nAND certification_status != 'Certified'\nAND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM completed_courses WHERE employee_name = 'Employee_Name' AND course_name = 'Training_Course_Name') > 0;\n```\n\nExplanation of the query:\n\n- `hr_database` is the table where we store employee details.\n- The `SET` clause is used to update `certification_status` to 'Certified'.\n- The `WHERE` clause ensures that:\n  - We are updating the correct employee based on `employee_name`.\n  - The update is for the correct `training_course`.\n  - The `certification_status` is updated only if it is not already 'Certified'.\n  - The employee has completed the training course, verified by a subquery checking a `completed_courses` table (assuming such a table exists to track course completions).\n\nMake sure to adjust the table and column names as per your actual database schema. If the `completed_courses` table doesn't exist, you would need to replace that part with whatever mechanism you have for tracking course completion."
