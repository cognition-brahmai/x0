I was able to install pip using `sudo easy_install pip` and virtualenv using `sudo pip install virtualenv`, but I'm having trouble when I try to install virtualenvwrapper with `sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper`. I get an error related to permissions and the `six` package. The error persists even when I use the `-H` flag as suggested, and disabling rootless with `sudo nvram boot-args=\"rootless=0\"` doesn't help. The error details are as follows: <insert stack trace>. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "It sounds like you're running into a permissions issue when trying to install `virtualenvwrapper` on OSX El Capitan, which is likely caused by System Integrity Protection (SIP). Here are a few steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Install pip and virtualenv without sudo**: It's generally a good practice to avoid using `sudo` with `pip install` to prevent permission issues. You can install pip for your user with the following commands:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m ensurepip --upgrade\n   ```\n\n   Then, install `virtualenv` for your user without `sudo`:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --user virtualenv\n   ```\n\n2. **Use the `--user` flag with pip**: When installing Python packages, use the `--user` flag to install them in your home directory. This avoids the need for `sudo` and potential permission issues.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --user virtualenvwrapper\n   ```\n\n3. **Ensure your PATH includes the user base binary directory**: After installing with `--user`, make sure that your shell can find the executables. Add the following to your `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, or equivalent:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=\"$HOME/Library/Python/2.7/bin:$PATH\"\n   ```\n\n   Replace `2.7` with your Python version if you're using a different version.\n\n4. **Check for existing installations**: There might be a conflict with existing installations of `six` or other packages. You can try upgrading `six` specifically:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --user --upgrade six\n   ```\n\n5. **Consider using `pyenv`**: If the above steps do not resolve the issue, consider using a tool like `pyenv` to manage your Python versions and virtual environments. `pyenv` can help isolate your Python environment from the system Python and avoid SIP-related issues.\n\n   To install `pyenv`, follow these steps:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew update\n   brew install pyenv\n   ```\n\n   Then, add `pyenv` initialization to your shell configuration file:\n\n   ```bash\n   echo 'eval \"$(pyenv init --path)\"' >> ~/.bash_profile\n   ```\n\n   Restart your terminal, and you can install and use different Python versions without impacting system Python.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the permission issues and successfully install `virtualenvwrapper`. Let me know if you need further assistance!"
