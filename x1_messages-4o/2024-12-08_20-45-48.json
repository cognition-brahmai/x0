You have collected the following data: \n- In a secluded valley in the Andes mountains, there are 90 people living in a small village.\n- In the depths of the Amazon rainforest, there are 60 indigenous people living in an isolated tribe.\n- On a remote island in the Indian Ocean, there are 25 fishermen living in a small village.\nUsing this information, can you calculate the total number of individuals currently residing in remote and isolated regions of the world that you have studied?"

To find the total number of individuals residing in the remote and isolated regions you have studied, simply add the populations of each location together:\n\n- 90 people in the Andes mountains\n- 60 people in the Amazon rainforest\n- 25 people on the remote island in the Indian Ocean\n\nTotal = 90 + 60 + 25 = 175\n\nTherefore, there are 175 individuals currently residing in the remote and isolated regions you have studied."
