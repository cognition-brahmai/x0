I have used an example I found that uses the `lambda` pattern for sorting. Here is my current code:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nfile_names = \"\"\"ayurveda_1.tif\nayurveda_11.tif\nayurveda_13.tif\nayurveda_2.tif\nayurveda_20.tif\nayurveda_22.tif\"\"\".split('\\n')\n\nnum_re = re.compile('_(\\d{1,2})\\.')\n\nfile_names.sort(\n    key=lambda fname: int(num_re.search(fname).group(1))\n)\n```\nIs there a more efficient way to achieve this?"

        "content": "Your current approach is quite efficient for sorting files numerically based on the number in their names. However, there are a few improvements you can consider for better readability and robustness. Here's an enhanced version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nfile_names = \"\"\"ayurveda_1.tif\nayurveda_11.tif\nayurveda_13.tif\nayurveda_2.tif\nayurveda_20.tif\nayurveda_22.tif\"\"\".split('\\n')\n\n# Compile the regex pattern once outside the sort function for efficiency\nnum_re = re.compile(r'_(\\d+)\\.')\n\ndef extract_number(fname):\n    match = num_re.search(fname)\n    if match:\n        return int(match.group(1))\n    return float('inf')  # In case no number is found, place at the end\n\n# Sort using the custom key function\nfile_names.sort(key=extract_number)\n\nprint(file_names)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n1. **Regex Pattern**: Changed `\\d{1,2}` to `\\d+` to handle any number of digits, making it more flexible.\n2. **Function Definition**: Moved the lambda function to a separate `extract_number` function for better readability and debugging.\n3. **Error Handling**: Added a check to handle cases where the regex might not find a match, returning `float('inf')` to push such files to the end of the list.\n\nThis code should perform efficiently and be easier to maintain, especially if you need to expand its functionality later."
