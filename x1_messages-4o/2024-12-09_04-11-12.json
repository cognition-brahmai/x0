All the servers have an old version of setuptools (0.6c8) which needs to be upgraded for the pymongo module as it requires setuptools>=0.6c9. However, pip starts installation with pymongo instead of setuptools, causing it to stop. Changing the module order in the requirements file does not help. I would like to avoid maintaining multiple requirements files now or in the future. This problem persists with pip 0.8.3. My requirements.txt file is as follows:\n\n```\nsetuptools>=0.6c9\npymongo==1.9\nsimplejson==2.1.3\n```\n\nIs there a way to specify the install order for pip as it doesn't seem to do this correctly on its own?"

        "content": "To specify the installation order for Python packages using pip, you can use a workaround by breaking down the installation process into separate steps rather than relying on pip to handle the dependencies in a particular order. Here are a few strategies you can employ:\n\n1. **Separate Installation Commands**: Instead of using a single `requirements.txt` file with a single `pip install` command, you can break it down into separate installation steps. For example, you can run:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install setuptools>=0.6c9\n    pip install pymongo==1.9\n    pip install simplejson==2.1.3\n    ```\n\n    This ensures that `setuptools` is upgraded before any other packages that depend on it.\n\n2. **Use a Shell Script**: Automate the installation process using a shell script. This script can install the packages in the required order:\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n\n    pip install setuptools>=0.6c9\n    pip install pymongo==1.9\n    pip install simplejson==2.1.3\n    ```\n\n    Save this script as `install.sh` and run it with `bash install.sh`.\n\n3. **Pre-Install Setuptools**: Ensure `setuptools` is installed or updated to the required version before you run `pip install -r requirements.txt`:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install --upgrade setuptools\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    ```\n\n4. **Use Constraints File**: You can use a `constraints.txt` file to specify versions of packages that must be satisfied. This file can be used alongside the `requirements.txt` to ensure that certain dependencies are installed in the desired versions:\n\n    ```text\n    # constraints.txt\n    setuptools>=0.6c9\n    ```\n\n    Then use:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install -r requirements.txt -c constraints.txt\n    ```\n\nThese methods ensure that `setuptools` is installed or upgraded before any other dependencies that require it, preventing installation issues due to order."
