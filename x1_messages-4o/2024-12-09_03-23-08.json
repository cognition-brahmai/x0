You can do this by using a character class that matches any non-word character except spaces. Here's how you can modify your `re.sub` call:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\norigList = \"your original string with brackets, commas, and other special characters\"\nstrippedList = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s]', '', origList)\n\nprint(strippedList)\n```\n\nHere's the breakdown of the regular expression `[^\\w\\s]`:\n\n- `\\w` matches any word character (equivalent to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`).\n- `\\s` matches any whitespace character, including spaces.\n- `^` inside the square brackets negates the character class, so `[^\\w\\s]` matches any character that is not a word character and not a whitespace character.\n\nThis will effectively remove all special characters but keep spaces intact."
