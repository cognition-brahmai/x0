However, I'm getting a ValueError: `decode_predictions` expects a batch of predictions (i.e. a 2D array of shape (samples, 1000)). Found array with shape: (1, 7, 7, 512). Can anyone suggest a solution for this problem? Here is my code:\n\n```python\nmodel = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False)\nimg_path = 'elephant.jpg'\nimg = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))\nx = image.img_to_array(img)\nx = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)\nx = preprocess_input(x)\n\nfeatures = model.predict(x)\n(inID, label) = decode_predictions(features)[0]   #ERROR HERE\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that you're using a VGG16 model without the fully connected top layers (i.e., `include_top=False`). This configuration outputs feature maps instead of class predictions. To decode predictions into class labels, you need the complete model with the top layers included. Here\u2019s how you can fix the error:\n\n1. Load the VGG16 model with the top layers included.\n2. Use `decode_predictions` on the output from this model.\n\nHere's the updated code:\n\n```python\nfrom keras.applications.vgg16 import VGG16, preprocess_input, decode_predictions\nfrom keras.preprocessing import image\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load the VGG16 model with top layers\nmodel = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=True)\n\nimg_path = 'elephant.jpg'\nimg = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))\nx = image.img_to_array(img)\nx = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)\nx = preprocess_input(x)\n\n# Get the predictions\npredictions = model.predict(x)\n\n# Decode the predictions into human-readable labels\ndecoded_predictions = decode_predictions(predictions, top=1)[0]\n(inID, label, confidence) = decoded_predictions[0]\n\nprint(f\"Predicted label: {label} with confidence: {confidence}\")\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n- **`include_top=True`**: This ensures that the fully connected layers of the VGG16 model are included, which are necessary for classification tasks.\n- **`decode_predictions(predictions, top=1)`**: This will give you the top prediction and its confidence score.\n\nWith these changes, you should be able to decode the predictions into class labels correctly."
