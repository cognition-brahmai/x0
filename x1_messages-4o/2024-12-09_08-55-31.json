        "content": "To convert a CSV file to JSON format in Python, you can use the `csv` module to read the CSV file and the `json` module to write the data in JSON format. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Read the CSV file**: Use the `csv.DictReader` to read the CSV file. This will allow you to work with the data in the form of dictionaries, which is helpful for converting to JSON.\n\n2. **Convert to JSON**: Use the `json.dumps()` method to convert the list of dictionaries to a JSON string.\n\n3. **Write to a JSON file**: If you want to save the JSON data to a file, you can use the `json.dump()` method.\n\nHere is a sample code to illustrate these steps:\n\n```python\nimport csv\nimport json\n\ndef csv_to_json(csv_file_path, json_file_path):\n    # Read the CSV file and convert it to a list of dictionaries\n    with open(csv_file_path, mode='r', encoding='utf-8') as csv_file:\n        csv_reader = csv.DictReader(csv_file)\n        data = [row for row in csv_reader]\n    \n    # Convert the list of dictionaries to JSON format\n    with open(json_file_path, mode='w', encoding='utf-8') as json_file:\n        json.dump(data, json_file, indent=4)\n\n# Example usage\ncsv_file_path = 'data.csv'  # Replace with your CSV file path\njson_file_path = 'data.json'  # Replace with your desired JSON file path\ncsv_to_json(csv_file_path, json_file_path)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`csv.DictReader`**: Reads the CSV file and maps the information in each row to a dictionary where the keys are the column headers.\n- **`json.dump()`**: Writes the list of dictionaries to a JSON file with pretty printing using `indent=4`.\n\nThis script will convert your CSV file to a JSON file, preserving the structure of your CSV data. Make sure to update the file paths as necessary for your specific use case."
