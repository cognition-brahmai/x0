However, even after the query finishes, the cursor and connection are closed, and I run garbage collection (gc), the process is still consuming an enormous amount of memory (7.3GB in this case). Is there a cleanup step that I am missing? Here is the code snippet I am using:\n\n```python\nimport psycopg2\nconn = psycopg2.connect(\"dbname='dbname' user='user' host='host'\")\ncursor = conn.cursor()\ncursor.execute(\"\"\"large query\"\"\")\nrows = cursor.fetchall()\ndel rows\ncursor.close()\nconn.close()\nimport gc\ngc.collect()\n```"

        "content": "When dealing with large queries, it's crucial to manage memory efficiently. Here are some steps and considerations to help reduce memory usage in your Python script:\n\n1. **Fetch in Batches**: Instead of using `fetchall()`, which loads all rows into memory at once, fetch the rows in smaller batches. This will significantly reduce memory usage. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n    ```python\n    import psycopg2\n\n    conn = psycopg2.connect(\"dbname='dbname' user='user' host='host'\")\n    cursor = conn.cursor()\n    cursor.execute(\"\"\"large query\"\"\")\n\n    batch_size = 1000  # Adjust the batch size according to your needs\n    while True:\n        rows = cursor.fetchmany(batch_size)\n        if not rows:\n            break\n        # Process the rows here\n\n    cursor.close()\n    conn.close()\n\n    import gc\n    gc.collect()\n    ```\n\n2. **Use Server-Side Cursors**: For very large datasets, consider using server-side cursors, which allow the database to manage the result set. This can be done by specifying a name for the cursor when you create it:\n\n    ```python\n    import psycopg2\n\n    conn = psycopg2.connect(\"dbname='dbname' user='user' host='host'\")\n    cursor = conn.cursor(name='server_side_cursor')\n    cursor.execute(\"\"\"large query\"\"\")\n\n    for row in cursor:\n        # Process each row\n\n    cursor.close()\n    conn.close()\n\n    import gc\n    gc.collect()\n    ```\n\n3. **Memory Profiling**: Use memory profiling tools such as `memory_profiler` to analyze your script's memory usage. This can help identify any other parts of your code that may be consuming excessive memory.\n\n4. **Optimize Query**: Ensure that your SQL query is optimized for performance and efficiency. Use indexes and avoid fetching unnecessary columns or rows.\n\n5. **Python Version**: Consider upgrading `psycopg2` to a newer version if possible, as newer versions may include performance improvements and bug fixes.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you should be able to reduce the memory footprint of your script when executing large queries."
