On the server, the package `django_modeltranslation-0.4.0_beta2` works fine, but on my local machine, the `django_modeltranslation-0.5.0-alpha` version does not work properly. Normally, I install it in virtual-env using `source bin/active` and `(env)$ pip install django_modeltranslation`, which gets the latest version. This time, however, I am facing issues with the latest version, so I uninstalled it using `(env)$ pip uninstall django_modeltranslation`. Now, I am unsure how to reinstall the working version `0.4.0 Beta`. I tried using `(env)$ pip install django_modeltranslation-0.4.0_beta2`, but it couldn't find the download that satisfies this requirement and no distributions were found at all. How can I install a specific version of a package with pip?"

        "content": "To install a specific version of a package using `pip`, you need to specify the version number in the `pip install` command. In your case, if you want to install version `0.4.0-beta2` of `django-modeltranslation`, you can do so by using the following command:\n\n```bash\npip install django-modeltranslation==0.4.0-beta2\n```\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to ensure everything is set up correctly:\n\n1. **Activate your virtual environment:**\n\n   Make sure your virtual environment is activated. You can do this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   source path_to_your_virtualenv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n   Replace `path_to_your_virtualenv` with the path to your virtual environment.\n\n2. **Uninstall any existing version:**\n\n   If you haven't already, uninstall any existing version of the package:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall django-modeltranslation\n   ```\n\n3. **Install the specific version:**\n\n   Now, install the specific version using:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install django-modeltranslation==0.4.0-beta2\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify the installation:**\n\n   You can verify that the correct version is installed by using:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip show django-modeltranslation\n   ```\n\n   This command will display information about the installed package, including the version number.\n\nIf the package version you are trying to install is not available on PyPI (Python Package Index), you might need to look for the specific version on the project's GitHub repository or other sources where it might be hosted. Sometimes, beta versions are not available on PyPI. If you find a source, you can install it directly using a URL or by downloading the package and installing it locally. For example:\n\n```bash\npip install https://github.com/deschler/django-modeltranslation/archive/0.4.0-beta2.zip\n```\n\nReplace the URL with the actual URL of the package version you need."
