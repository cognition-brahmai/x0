I have 100 examples stored in an input file with each line containing one example. I need to randomly choose 50 lines for the training set and the remaining 50 for the testing set. I have accomplished this in Matlab using a specific function but I am unsure how to translate this into Python."

        "content": "To split a dataset into a training set and a testing set in Python, you can use the `random` module to shuffle the data and then split it. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n1. **Read the data from the file:** Read all lines from the file into a list.\n\n2. **Shuffle the data:** Use the `random.shuffle()` function to randomly shuffle the list.\n\n3. **Split the data:** Divide the shuffled list into two equal halves for training and testing sets.\n\nHere's a sample code to demonstrate this:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# Step 1: Read data from file\nwith open('input_file.txt', 'r') as file:\n    data = file.readlines()\n\n# Step 2: Shuffle the data\nrandom.shuffle(data)\n\n# Step 3: Split the data\nsplit_index = len(data) // 2\ntraining_set = data[:split_index]\ntesting_set = data[split_index:]\n\n# Optional: Write the training and testing sets to separate files\nwith open('training_set.txt', 'w') as train_file:\n    train_file.writelines(training_set)\n\nwith open('testing_set.txt', 'w') as test_file:\n    test_file.writelines(testing_set)\n\nprint(\"Data has been split into training and testing sets.\")\n```\n\nThis code will:\n\n- Read all lines from `input_file.txt`.\n- Shuffle the lines randomly.\n- Split the shuffled lines into two equal parts, storing them in `training_set` and `testing_set`.\n- Optionally, write the training and testing sets to separate files for later use.\n\nMake sure to replace `'input_file.txt'` with the path to your actual input file."
