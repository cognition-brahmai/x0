        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to incorrect syntax in your `for` loop. The `(peptides.txt)` syntax is not valid for iterating over file contents in Bash. Instead, you can use a `while` loop with `read` to iterate over each line of the file. Here's how you can modify your script to achieve that:\n\n```bash\necho \"Start!\"\nwhile IFS= read -r line\ndo\n    echo \"${line}\"\ndone < peptides.txt\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the changes:\n\n- `while IFS= read -r line`: This reads each line of the file into the variable `line`, one at a time. The `IFS=` is used to ensure that leading/trailing whitespace is preserved and `-r` prevents backslashes from being interpreted as escape characters.\n\n- `done < peptides.txt`: This redirects the contents of `peptides.txt` into the `while` loop.\n\nUsing this method, you can iterate over each line of your file and process it accordingly."
