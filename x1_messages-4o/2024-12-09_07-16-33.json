I expected to see `[[], [1,2,3], [1]]` instead."

        "content": "The behavior you're experiencing is related to how the list is initialized. When you create a 2D list using the syntax `listy = [[]] * 3`, you're not creating three independent sublists. Instead, you're creating a list with three references to the same sublist. This means that any modification to one of these sublists will affect all of them since they all point to the same object in memory.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. `listy = [[]] * 3` creates a list that contains three references to the same empty list. This is why when you append to one of these sublists, the change is reflected in all of them.\n\n2. When you do `listy[1] = [1, 2]`, you are assigning a new list `[1, 2]` to the second position, which breaks the shared reference for that position only.\n\n3. When you append to `listy[1]`, it works as expected because it now points to a new, independent list.\n\n4. When you then append to `listy[2]`, it appends to all references of the original empty list, which is still shared between `listy[0]` and `listy[2]`.\n\nTo avoid this issue, you should initialize your list in a way that ensures each sublist is independent. One common way to do this is with a list comprehension:\n\n```python\nlisty = [[] for _ in range(3)]\n```\n\nWith this approach, each sublist is a separate object, and you can modify them independently:\n\n```python\nlisty[1].append(3)\nprint(listy)  # Output: [[], [3], []]\n\nlisty[2].append(1)\nprint(listy)  # Output: [[], [3], [1]]\n```\n\nThis behavior is a common \"gotcha\" in Python when dealing with mutable objects like lists."
