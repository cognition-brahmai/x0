        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the `cryptography` library now requiring a Rust compiler to build from source. This is a recent change and can be resolved by installing the Rust compiler in your Docker image or by ensuring you have the appropriate precompiled wheels available.\n\nHere are two ways you can solve this issue:\n\n### Option 1: Install Rust\n\nYou can install Rust in your Alpine-based Docker image by adding another package to your `apk add` command. Modify your Dockerfile as follows:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM python:3.7-alpine\n\nENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1\n\nRUN apk update \\\n  # Install Rust for cryptography\n  && apk add --no-cache gcc musl-dev python3-dev libffi-dev rust cargo \\\n  # psycopg2 dependencies\n  && apk add --virtual build-deps gcc python3-dev musl-dev \\\n  && apk add postgresql-dev \\\n  && apk add build-base \\\n  # Pillow dependencies\n  && apk add jpeg-dev zlib-dev freetype-dev lcms2-dev openjpeg-dev tiff-dev tk-dev tcl-dev \\\n  # CFFI dependencies\n  && apk add libffi-dev py-cffi \\\n  # Translations dependencies\n  && apk add gettext \\\n  # https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/#dbshell\n  && apk add postgresql-client \\\n  # cairo\n  && apk add cairo cairo-dev pango-dev gdk-pixbuf-dev poppler-utils\n\n# fonts for weasyprint\nRUN mkdir ~/.fonts\nCOPY ./fonts/* /root/.fonts/\n\n# secret key (should be in docker-secrets, or we need to run minikube locally\nRUN mkdir /etc/secrets\nCOPY secret.readme proxy_rsa_key* /etc/secrets/\n\n# Requirements are installed here to ensure they will be cached.\nCOPY ./requirements /requirements\nRUN pip install -r /requirements/local.txt\n\nCOPY ./compose/local/django/entrypoint /entrypoint\nRUN sed -i 's/\\r//' /entrypoint\nRUN chmod +x /entrypoint\n\nCOPY ./compose/local/django/start /start\nRUN sed -i 's/\\r//' /start\nRUN chmod +x /start\n\nCOPY ./compose/local/django/celery/worker/start /start-celeryworker\nRUN sed -i 's/\\r//' /start-celeryworker\nRUN chmod +x /start-celeryworker\n\nCOPY ./compose/local/django/celery/beat/start /start-celerybeat\nRUN sed -i 's/\\r//' /start-celerybeat\nRUN chmod +x /start-celerybeat\n\nCOPY ./compose/local/django/celery/flower/start /start-flower\nRUN sed -i 's/\\r//' /start-flower\nRUN chmod +x /start-flower\n\nWORKDIR /app\n\nENTRYPOINT [\"/entrypoint\"]\n```\n\n### Option 2: Use Precompiled Wheels\n\nAlternatively, you can specify a version of `cryptography` in your `requirements/local.txt` file that does not require Rust, or you can ensure that your environment has access to precompiled wheels by using manylinux wheels. This might involve adjusting your requirements file to use a version constraint like:\n\n```\ncryptography<3.4\n```\n\nPlease note that using an older version might not include the latest security updates or features, so it's generally better to use the first option if possible.\n\nAfter making these changes, rebuild your Docker image. This should resolve the build error related to the `cryptography` component."
