I am attempting to use a list comprehension to compare string objects, but one of the strings is a utf-8 string, which is the output from json.loads. I have the following utf-8 string:\n\n```python\nus = u'MyString'\n```\n\nWhy does the comparison `us.encode('utf-8') == \"MyString\"` return False? Also, how can I compare within a list comprehension similar to the one below?\n\n```python\nmyComp = [utfString for utfString in jsonLoadsObj\n           if utfString.encode('utf-8') == \"MyString\"]\n```\n\nI'm using Google App Engine, which uses Python 2.7. Here's a more expansive example of the problem. Suppose I have a json coming from a remote server and the response object looks like: \n\n```python\n{\"number1\":\"first\", \"number2\":\"second\"}\n```\n\nUpon loading the response, I get the keys and need to filter them using a condition:\n\n```python\ndata = json.loads(response)\nk = data.keys()\n\nmyList = [item for item in k if item==\"number1\"]  \n```\n\nI thought encoding the items would solve the problem, but the following still doesn't work:\n\n```python\nmyList = [item for item in k if item.encode('utf-8')==\"number1\"]\n```"

        "content": "In Python 2.7, strings can be either Unicode (`unicode` type) or byte strings (`str` type). When dealing with JSON data, `json.loads` returns Unicode strings by default. In your case, the keys you get from `json.loads` are of type `unicode`, and when you compare them directly to a byte string (plain string literal), it should work without needing to encode them, because Python 2.7 handles Unicode and string comparisons automatically. However, if you explicitly encode a Unicode string to UTF-8 and compare it with a plain string, it might result in unexpected behavior if you're not consistent with the types across your comparisons.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can address the issue:\n\n1. When comparing Unicode strings with plain strings, ensure the plain strings are also Unicode. Prepend a `u` to your plain string literals to make them Unicode.\n\n2. Avoid encoding the Unicode strings to UTF-8 for comparison purposes unless you are comparing with a byte string.\n\n3. If you do need to compare against a byte string, make sure both sides of the comparison are byte strings.\n\nGiven your code, here\u2019s how you can modify it:\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Direct Comparison with Unicode:**\n   You can compare the Unicode keys directly with Unicode literals:\n\n   ```python\n   myList = [item for item in k if item == u\"number1\"]\n   ```\n\n2. **Ensure Consistent Types:**\n   If you need to use byte strings for some reason, ensure both sides are byte strings:\n\n   ```python\n   myList = [item for item in k if item.encode('utf-8') == b\"number1\"]\n   ```\n\n3. **Use Unicode Everywhere:**\n   To avoid confusion, use Unicode literals consistently:\n\n   ```python\n   us = u'MyString'\n   myComp = [utfString for utfString in jsonLoadsObj if utfString == u\"MyString\"]\n   ```\n\n### Example with JSON:\n\nGiven your JSON object:\n\n```python\nresponse = '{\"number1\":\"first\", \"number2\":\"second\"}'\ndata = json.loads(response)  # data is a dictionary with Unicode keys\nk = data.keys()  # k is a list of Unicode strings\n\n# Correct comparison\nmyList = [item for item in k if item == u\"number1\"]\n```\n\nThis ensures that both sides of your comparison are Unicode, which should work correctly in Python 2.7.\n\n### Recommendation:\n\nIf possible, consider upgrading to Python 3, where strings are Unicode by default, and the confusion between Unicode and byte strings is greatly reduced."
