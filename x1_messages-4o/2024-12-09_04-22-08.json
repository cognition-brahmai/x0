I am building a desktop application where I need to call a Python function which cannot be awaited. I need to send a list of URLs from the desktop application and receive back responses from every URL in an asynchronous manner. I've attempted to implement this, but I am encountering a SyntaxError that I don't know how to bypass. Additionally, I've made some changes to the code, but I end up with a TypeError saying \"object ClientResponse can't be used in 'await' expression\". Can you help me solve this issue?"

        "content": "To call an asynchronous function from a synchronous method in Python 3.6.2, you can utilize the `asyncio` library to manage the asynchronous tasks. Below are steps and an example to help you solve the issue:\n\n1. **Using `asyncio.run()` (Python 3.7+)**: Since you are using Python 3.6.2, you don't have access to `asyncio.run()`. Instead, you can use an `asyncio` event loop manually.\n\n2. **Using `asyncio.get_event_loop()`**: This is a common approach for Python versions before 3.7.\n\n3. **Handling `ClientResponse`**: Ensure that you are properly awaiting the response object if your code logic supports it. If a `TypeError` occurs, it\u2019s usually due to not awaiting an actual coroutine.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how to structure your code:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport aiohttp\n\nasync def fetch_url(session, url):\n    async with session.get(url) as response:\n        return await response.text()\n\nasync def fetch_all_urls(urls):\n    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n        tasks = [fetch_url(session, url) for url in urls]\n        responses = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\n        return responses\n\ndef get_responses(urls):\n    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n    responses = loop.run_until_complete(fetch_all_urls(urls))\n    return responses\n\n# Example usage\nurls = ['http://example.com', 'http://example.org']\nresponses = get_responses(urls)\nfor response in responses:\n    print(response)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Ensure `aiohttp` is Installed**: Install it using `pip install aiohttp` if you haven't already.\n  \n- **Event Loop Management**: Use `get_event_loop()` to create or get the existing event loop. With `run_until_complete()`, you can run the asynchronous code synchronously.\n\n- **Awaiting Properly**: Ensure that you are correctly awaiting responses in the `fetch_url` function.\n\n- **Python 3.6 Compatibility**: This example is compatible with Python 3.6.2, avoiding features introduced in later versions.\n\nIf you follow these steps and structure your code as shown, you should be able to handle asynchronous requests in your synchronous application without encountering `SyntaxError` or `TypeError`. If issues persist, make sure to check the exact line causing the error and adjust accordingly."
