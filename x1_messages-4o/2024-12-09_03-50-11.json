I've been attempting to use the subprocess.check_call() function, but it consistently fails with the error 'OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory'. Is there something wrong with my approach? Is there a superior method for gzipping a file rather than using subprocess.check_call()? Here's the code I've been using:\n\n```python\nfrom subprocess import check_call\n\ndef gZipFile(fullFilePath):\n    check_call('gzip ' + fullFilePath)\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that the `gzip` command is not being found, which could be due to a few reasons such as the command not being installed or an incorrect file path. However, using `subprocess.check_call()` isn't the most Pythonic way to gzip a file. Python provides built-in support for gzipping files using the `gzip` module, which is more robust and portable. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nimport gzip\nimport shutil\n\ndef gzip_file(input_file_path, output_file_path=None):\n    # If no output file path is provided, append '.gz' to the input file path\n    if output_file_path is None:\n        output_file_path = input_file_path + '.gz'\n    \n    with open(input_file_path, 'rb') as f_in:\n        with gzip.open(output_file_path, 'wb') as f_out:\n            shutil.copyfileobj(f_in, f_out)\n    print(f\"File '{input_file_path}' has been gzipped to '{output_file_path}'\")\n\n# Example usage:\n# gzip_file('path/to/your/file.txt')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`gzip.open(output_file_path, 'wb')`**: This opens a new gzip file in write mode.\n- **`shutil.copyfileobj(f_in, f_out)`**: This efficiently copies the content from the input file to the gzip file.\n\nThis method avoids external dependencies and should work on any system where Python is installed, without requiring the `gzip` command-line utility to be present."
