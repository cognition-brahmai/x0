When I run the code `[] = \"\"` or `[] = ()`, no exception is raised even though an empty list is not equivalent to an empty string or tuple. However, when I try to run `\"\" = []` or `() = \"\"`, as expected, an exception is raised. Could you explain why this happens?"

        "content": "In Python, the behavior you're observing is due to the way Python handles unpacking and assignment. When you use an empty list on the left side of an assignment, such as `[] = \"\"` or `[] = ()`, Python is interpreting this as an unpacking assignment. This means that Python is trying to unpack the right-hand side iterable into the targets specified on the left-hand side.\n\nHere's why no exception is raised for `[] = \"\"` or `[] = ()`:\n\n- The left side `[]` is an empty list, which indicates that you want to unpack zero elements from the right-hand side iterable.\n- The right-hand side `\"\"` (an empty string) or `()` (an empty tuple) are also iterable objects that contain zero elements.\n- Since both sides involve zero elements, the unpacking operation is technically valid and succeeds without any issue.\n\nOn the other hand, when you try to do `\"\" = []` or `() = \"\"`, you're attempting to assign to an immutable object, which is not allowed. The left-hand side must be a valid assignment target, such as a variable or a list of variables, but in these cases, you're attempting to assign to a string or a tuple directly, which doesn't make sense in Python's syntax and semantics, hence the exception is raised.\n\nIn summary, `[] = \"\"` or `[] = ()` succeeds because the unpacking matches the zero elements expected on both sides, while `\"\" = []` or `() = \"\"` fails due to trying to assign directly to immutable objects, which is not allowed."
