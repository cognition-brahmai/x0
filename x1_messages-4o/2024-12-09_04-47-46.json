In the process, I've encountered an issue with creating a list where each element is a distinct instance of an object I've created. My current approach is to create a new class, instantiate it, assign an attribute and then append it to a list. I repeat this process in a loop, however, the list seems to contain multiple references to the same object rather than distinct instances. How can I ensure that each element of the list contains a different instance of the object instead of all pointing to the same one? Here's my current code:\n\n```python\nclass SimpleClass(object):\n    pass\n\nx = SimpleClass\nsimpleList = []\nfor count in range(0,4):       \n    x.attr1= '*Bob* '* count\n    print \"Loop Count: %s Attribute Value %s\" % (count, x.attr1)\n    simpleList.append(x)\n\nprint '-'*20\n\ny = SimpleClass\nprint \"Reading the attributes from the objects in the list\"\nfor count in range(0,4):\n    y = simpleList[count]\n    print y.attr1\n```"

        "content": "In your current code, you're not actually creating new instances of `SimpleClass` in each iteration of the loop. Instead, you're assigning attributes to the class itself, not an instance, and appending the same reference to the list multiple times. As a result, all elements in `simpleList` are references to the same object.\n\nTo ensure each element of the list contains a different instance of the object, you need to instantiate a new instance of `SimpleClass` inside the loop. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve that:\n\n```python\nclass SimpleClass(object):\n    pass\n\nsimpleList = []\nfor count in range(0,4):\n    x = SimpleClass()  # Create a new instance of SimpleClass\n    x.attr1 = '*Bob* ' * count\n    print(\"Loop Count: %s Attribute Value: %s\" % (count, x.attr1))\n    simpleList.append(x)\n\nprint('-' * 20)\n\nprint(\"Reading the attributes from the objects in the list:\")\nfor count in range(0,4):\n    y = simpleList[count]\n    print(y.attr1)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n1. **Instantiation**: The line `x = SimpleClass()` inside the loop creates a new instance of `SimpleClass` in each iteration.\n\n2. **Appending Instances**: Each new instance `x` is appended to `simpleList`, ensuring that each element in the list is a distinct object.\n\nWith these changes, you will have a list of distinct instances, each with its own `attr1` value."
