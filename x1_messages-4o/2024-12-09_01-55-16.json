I have an array that looks like this: \n\n```python\na = array([[1,3,4],[1,2,3]...[1,2,1]])\n```\n\nI want to add an element, let's call it 'x', to each row so that my array would look like this:\n\n```python\na = array([[1,3,4,x],[1,2,3,x]...[1,2,1,x]])\n```\n\nI tried using `a[n] = array([1,3,4,x])`, but numpy returned a shape mismatch error. I also tried iterating through `a` and appending 'x' to each item, but the changes did not seem to be reflected. How can I add an item to each row in my numpy array?"

        "content": "To add an element 'x' to each row of a NumPy array, you can use the `numpy.append()` function or `numpy.hstack()` function. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original array\na = np.array([[1, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 1]])\n\n# Element to add\nx = 5  # Replace with your desired value for 'x'\n\n# Method 1: Using numpy.append\na_with_x = np.array([np.append(row, x) for row in a])\n\n# Method 2: Using numpy.hstack\n# Reshape the element to add so it matches the shape of rows in 'a'\nx_column = np.full((a.shape[0], 1), x)\na_with_x = np.hstack((a, x_column))\n\nprint(a_with_x)\n```\n\nBoth methods will yield the array with the added element 'x' to each row. `np.append()` is used within a list comprehension to append 'x' to each row individually, while `np.hstack()` is used to horizontally stack the original array with a new column containing 'x'. Choose the method that best fits your use case."
