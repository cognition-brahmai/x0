During a recent docker build on our CI pipeline, an operation that used to take about 10 minutes timed out after an hour of pip installation messages. This seems to be happening for almost every library that is installed by any dependency. The messages suggest that pip is looking at multiple versions of setuptools to determine compatibility, which could take a while. It seems like I am experiencing what is described as \"backtracking\" in the release notes. I understand that I can use a constraint file to reduce the runtime, but I am unsure of the best way to produce this file. I tried running `pip install setup.py` locally in a new virtual environment, followed by `pip freeze > constraints.txt`, but this is still taking a lot of time. What is the recommended process here?"

        "content": "The new dependency resolver in pip 20.3 can indeed cause longer installation times due to its thoroughness in checking for compatibility across all dependencies. This is especially noticeable when there are complex dependency trees with conflicting requirements.\n\nTo address this issue and improve the installation time in your CI pipeline, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. **Use a Constraint File**: A constraint file can help limit the versions pip considers, thus reducing backtracking. Here's a more efficient way to generate it:\n\n   - Create a clean virtual environment.\n   - Install your package(s) along with their dependencies in this environment.\n   - Use `pip freeze` to capture the installed package versions, but make sure to only include the necessary ones:\n     ```sh\n     pip install your-package\n     pip freeze > constraints.txt\n     ```\n\n2. **Pin Your Dependencies**: In your `requirements.txt` file, specify exact versions for your direct dependencies. This minimizes the resolver's workload by reducing the number of potential combinations it has to consider.\n\n3. **Pre-build Your Environment**: If possible, pre-build your environment and cache it in your CI pipeline. This way, you won't have to resolve and install dependencies from scratch every time.\n\n4. **Use Previous Pip Version**: If the new resolver is causing significant delays and you don't need its benefits right away, you could revert to an earlier version of pip temporarily:\n   ```sh\n   pip install pip==20.2.4\n   ```\n\n5. **Optimize Your Dockerfile**: Make sure your Dockerfile is optimized for caching. This can help reduce build times by reusing layers that haven't changed.\n\n6. **Profile the Installation**: Use `pipdeptree` or similar tools to analyze the dependency tree and identify problematic packages that might be causing excessive backtracking.\n\n7. **Incremental Builds**: If certain dependencies rarely change, consider building them into a base image that your main Docker image builds upon. This can save time during CI builds.\n\n8. **Experiment with `--use-feature=2020-resolver`**: While this is the default now, you can still explicitly specify it and use it to experiment with different options like `--prefer-binary`.\n\nBy carefully managing your dependencies and using constraint files effectively, you should be able to mitigate the issues caused by the new resolver."
