Here's how you can do it:\n\nSuppose you have a string `line` that you want to split and then select specific elements by their indices, similar to your Perl code.\n\nHere's an example in Python:\n\n```python\nline = \"a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p\"\nelements = line.split(',')\n\n# Select specific elements by their indices\none, four, ten = elements[1], elements[4], elements[10]\n\nprint(one, four, ten)\n```\n\nIn this example, `line.split(',')` splits the string into a list of elements. Then, you can access the specific elements by their indices `[1, 4, 10]` and unpack them into variables `one`, `four`, and `ten`."
