In the past year, they produced 10,000 units, resulting in 500,000 units of greenhouse gases emitted. However, they are planning to increase production by 20%. How many total units of greenhouse gases will they emit after the increase in production? Assume that there are no changes in production processes or other contributing factors."

Current production level: 10,000 units\n2. Planned increase in production: 20%\n\nFirst, calculate the increased production:\n\\[ \\text{Increased production} = \\text{Current production} \\times (1 + \\text{Increase percentage}) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Increased production} = 10,000 \\times (1 + 0.20) = 10,000 \\times 1.20 = 12,000 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nNow, calculate the total greenhouse gas emissions for the increased production:\n\\[ \\text{Emissions per unit} = 50 \\text{ units of greenhouse gases} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total emissions} = \\text{Increased production} \\times \\text{Emissions per unit} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total emissions} = 12,000 \\times 50 = 600,000 \\text{ units of greenhouse gases} \\]\n\nTherefore, after the increase in production, the company will emit a total of 600,000 units of greenhouse gases."
