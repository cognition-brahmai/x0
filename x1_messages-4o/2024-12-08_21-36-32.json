        "content": "To retrieve weather information for a specific location like Amsterdam, Netherlands using Ruby and the OpenWeatherMap API, the provided code snippet is a good starting point. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the code and some additional information to help you get started:\n\n1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have the `json` and `open-uri` libraries available. These are part of the Ruby standard library, so you don\u2019t need to install them separately.\n\n2. **Obtain an API Key**: Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and get your API key. Replace `'your_api_key'` in the code with your actual API key.\n\n3. **Understanding the Code**:\n   - The function `get_weather_data(location)` constructs a URL to fetch weather data for a given location.\n   - It uses `URI.open(url).read` to make an HTTP request and reads the response.\n   - The response, which is in JSON format, is parsed into a Ruby hash with `JSON.parse(response)`.\n   - The weather description and temperature are extracted from the hash and printed.\n\n4. **Temperature Conversion**: OpenWeatherMap provides temperature in Kelvin by default. The code converts it to Celsius by subtracting 273.15.\n\n5. **Running the Code**: Ensure your Ruby environment is set up, then execute the script in your terminal or preferred Ruby environment.\n\nHere\u2019s the complete code:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'json'\nrequire 'open-uri'\n\ndef get_weather_data(location)\n  api_key = 'your_api_key'  # Replace with your OpenWeatherMap API key\n  url = \"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=#{location}&appid=#{api_key}\"\n  response = URI.open(url).read\n  JSON.parse(response)\nend\n\nweather_data = get_weather_data('Amsterdam,Netherlands')\nputs \"The weather in Amsterdam is currently #{weather_data['weather'][0]['description']} with a temperature of #{(weather_data['main']['temp'] - 273.15).round(2)}\u00b0C.\"\n```\n\n**Additional Tips**:\n- **Error Handling**: Consider adding error handling for scenarios where the API might not respond, or the location is invalid.\n- **Units Parameter**: OpenWeatherMap allows specifying units (metric, imperial) in the API request to get temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit directly. You can modify the URL to include `&units=metric` if you prefer to receive the temperature in Celsius directly without conversion.\n- **Explore API Features**: OpenWeatherMap offers various endpoints and additional data like forecasts, which might be useful depending on your application.\n\nThis setup should help you retrieve and display weather data for any specified location using Ruby and the OpenWeatherMap API."
