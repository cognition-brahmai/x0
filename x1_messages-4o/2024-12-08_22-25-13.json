        "content": "To create a CSS class using C#, you can dynamically generate the CSS as a string and then use it wherever needed, such as writing to a file, embedding in an HTML page, or serving through a web application. Here's an example of how you could achieve this:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.IO;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        // Define the CSS class as a string\n        string cssClass = @\"\n.myCustomClass {\n    font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;\n    font-size: 14px;\n    max-font-size: 14px;\n}\";\n\n        // Optionally, write the CSS to a file\n        File.WriteAllText(\"styles.css\", cssClass);\n\n        // Output the CSS to the console\n        Console.WriteLine(\"CSS class created:\");\n        Console.WriteLine(cssClass);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **CSS Class Definition**: The CSS class is defined as a string in C# with the desired styles. In this case, the `font-family` is set to \"Times New Roman\" and `font-size` is limited to 14px.\n\n2. **Writing to a File**: The `File.WriteAllText` method is used to write the CSS string to a file named `styles.css`. This file can then be linked to an HTML document.\n\n3. **Output to Console**: For demonstration purposes, the CSS is also printed to the console.\n\n### Usage:\n\n- You can include the generated `styles.css` file in your HTML by linking it within the `<head>` section:\n  ```html\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"styles.css\">\n  ```\n\n- Apply the class to an HTML element:\n  ```html\n  <p class=\"myCustomClass\">This is a sample text with Times New Roman font and font size limited to 14px.</p>\n  ```\n\nThis approach allows you to programmatically generate and manage CSS using C#. Adjust the path and file handling as needed for your specific application context."
