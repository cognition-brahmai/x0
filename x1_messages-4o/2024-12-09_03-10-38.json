        "content": "Yes, you can run Python or other languages in GitHub's Atom editor and achieve a functionality similar to Sublime Text's build system by using a combination of packages available for Atom.\n\nHere's how you can set it up:\n\n1. **Install Atom Packages:**\n   - **Script**: This package allows you to run scripts in Atom. You can install it by going to `File > Settings > Install` and searching for \"script\". Install the package named \"script\".\n   - **Terminal or Platformio-ide-terminal (Optional)**: If you want a more integrated terminal experience within Atom, you can install a terminal package. Install \"platformio-ide-terminal\" for a terminal panel within Atom.\n\n2. **Running Code:**\n   - After installing the \"script\" package, you can run your Python code by opening the Python file you want to execute and pressing `Cmd + I` on macOS or `Ctrl + Shift + B` on Windows/Linux. The output will be displayed at the bottom of the editor.\n   - For other languages, the \"script\" package supports many languages out of the box. If your language is supported, the same key combination will work.\n\n3. **Custom Keybindings (Optional):**\n   - If you want to customize your keybindings to be `Cmd + B` or `Ctrl + B` similar to Sublime Text, you can do so by editing the keymap:\n     - Go to `File > Keymap`.\n     - Add a custom keybinding like this:\n       ```cson\n       'atom-text-editor':\n         'cmd-b': 'script:run'  # For macOS\n         'ctrl-b': 'script:run'  # For Windows/Linux\n       ```\n\n4. **Closing the Output:**\n   - You can close the script output panel by clicking the close button on the panel or using a shortcut (if defined in your setup).\n\nThese steps should enable you to run your code within Atom similarly to how you would in Sublime Text."
