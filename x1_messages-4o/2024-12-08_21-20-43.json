Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Function to check if a number is prime\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\n# Function to generate the first 50 prime numbers\ndef first_n_primes(n):\n    primes = []\n    num = 2\n    while len(primes) < n:\n        if is_prime(num):\n            primes.append(num)\n        num += 1\n    return primes\n\n# Calculate the sum of square roots of the first 50 prime numbers\ndef sum_of_square_roots(primes):\n    return sum(math.sqrt(p) for p in primes)\n\n# Find the remainder when the sum is divided by 11\ndef remainder_of_sum(sum_value, divisor):\n    return sum_value % divisor\n\n# Main computation\nfirst_50_primes = first_n_primes(50)\nsum_sqrt_primes = sum_of_square_roots(first_50_primes)\nremainder = remainder_of_sum(sum_sqrt_primes, 11)\n\nremainder\n```\n\nThis script defines a function to check if a number is prime, generates the first 50 prime numbers, calculates their square roots, sums these square roots, and finally computes the remainder when the sum is divided by 11.\n\nRunning this code will give you the remainder of the sum of the square roots of the first 50 prime numbers divided by 11."
