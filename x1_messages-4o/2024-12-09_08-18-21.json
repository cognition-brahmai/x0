I know about the option to create a custom message, which can carry some information, but sometimes the data is more complex and can't easily be represented as a string. For instance, if I am testing a method 'bar' from a class 'Foo' and using data from a list called 'testdata' like this:\n\n```python\nclass TestBar(unittest.TestCase):\n    def runTest(self):\n        for t1, t2 in testdata:\n            f = Foo(t1)\n            self.assertEqual(f.bar(t2), 2)\n```\n\nIf the test fails, I would like to output t1, t2 and/or f, to understand why this particular data caused a failure. By \"output,\" I mean that the variables can be accessed like any other variables, after the test has been run. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To achieve this, you can utilize Python's `unittest` module's features to improve the debugging information when a test fails. Here are a few strategies you can use:\n\n### 1. Use `assertEqual` with a Custom Message:\n\nEven though you've mentioned this, it's worth noting that you can include dynamic information in the custom message. You can use f-strings or the `.format()` method to include variable data in the message.\n\n```python\nclass TestBar(unittest.TestCase):\n    def runTest(self):\n        for t1, t2 in testdata:\n            f = Foo(t1)\n            self.assertEqual(f.bar(t2), 2, f\"Failed for t1: {t1}, t2: {t2}, f: {f}\")\n```\n\n### 2. Use `self.subTest`:\n\n`subTest` is a feature in `unittest` that allows you to create subtests. This way, each iteration can be treated as an individual test, and you can provide context-sensitive information.\n\n```python\nclass TestBar(unittest.TestCase):\n    def runTest(self):\n        for t1, t2 in testdata:\n            with self.subTest(t1=t1, t2=t2):\n                f = Foo(t1)\n                self.assertEqual(f.bar(t2), 2, f\"Failed for f: {f}\")\n```\n\n### 3. Capture More Detailed Information:\n\nIf you want to capture more complex data or output debug information separately, you can use `print` statements or Python's logging module. However, these won't be part of the assertion message itself but can help you see what's happening during the test execution.\n\n```python\nclass TestBar(unittest.TestCase):\n    def runTest(self):\n        for t1, t2 in testdata:\n            f = Foo(t1)\n            result = f.bar(t2)\n            if result != 2:\n                print(f\"Debug Info - t1: {t1}, t2: {t2}, f: {f}, result: {result}\")\n            self.assertEqual(result, 2)\n```\n\n### 4. Custom Test Runner or Test Result:\n\nFor more control, you might consider creating a custom test runner or extending the `TestResult` class to handle exceptions and failures in a way that captures the local variables or stack trace details.\n\n### 5. Use a Debugger:\n\nFinally, if you need to interact with the variables in real-time, you might consider using a debugger like `pdb`. You can set breakpoints and inspect the state of variables when a test fails.\n\n```python\nimport pdb\n\nclass TestBar(unittest.TestCase):\n    def runTest(self):\n        for t1, t2 in testdata:\n            f = Foo(t1)\n            try:\n                self.assertEqual(f.bar(t2), 2)\n            except AssertionError:\n                pdb.set_trace()  # Enter debugger on failure\n```\n\nThese methods can help you better understand why a particular test case is failing by providing more context and information."
