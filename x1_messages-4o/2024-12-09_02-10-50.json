This error occurs at the statement `print title`. I attempted to resolve this by using `print unicode(title)`, but this did not help. Why does this issue only arise when the program is run as a cron job and how can I fix it?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to the environment in which your cron job is running. When you run a script from the command line, it inherits the environment settings from your shell, including the locale settings, which define how characters are encoded and decoded. However, cron jobs typically run in a more limited environment that does not inherit these settings, leading to the `UnicodeEncodeError` you're seeing.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to resolving this issue:\n\n1. **Set the Locale**: You can explicitly set the locale within your Python script to ensure it uses the correct encoding. Add the following lines at the beginning of your script to set the environment variables:\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    import sys\n\n    # Set default encoding to UTF-8\n    os.environ['LC_ALL'] = 'en_US.UTF-8'\n    os.environ['LANG'] = 'en_US.UTF-8'\n    ```\n\n2. **Use UTF-8 Encoding in Python 2**: When dealing with strings in Python 2, it's a good practice to ensure they are properly encoded. You can explicitly encode your strings before printing them:\n\n    ```python\n    print title.encode('utf-8')\n    ```\n\n3. **Redirect Output**: If your script is outputting to a file (or even a terminal), you might want to redirect the output to ensure it handles Unicode correctly. You can do this by redirecting the output in your cron job command:\n\n    ```bash\n    * * * * * /usr/bin/python /path/to/your_script.py >> /path/to/logfile.log 2>&1\n    ```\n\n4. **Check the Cron Environment**: To diagnose environment differences, you can create a temporary cron job that outputs the environment variables to a file:\n\n    ```bash\n    * * * * * env > /path/to/cron_env.txt\n    ```\n\n   Compare these with the environment variables when you run the script manually to identify differences.\n\n5. **Use `sys.setdefaultencoding` (with caution)**: As a last resort, you can change the default encoding for the Python interpreter, although this is generally discouraged:\n\n    ```python\n    import sys\n    reload(sys)\n    sys.setdefaultencoding('utf-8')\n    ```\n\n   Note that using `sys.setdefaultencoding` is considered a hack and should be used with caution because it can have unintended side effects.\n\nBy ensuring your script explicitly sets the encoding and handles Unicode properly, you should be able to run it successfully as a cron job without encountering `UnicodeEncodeError`."
