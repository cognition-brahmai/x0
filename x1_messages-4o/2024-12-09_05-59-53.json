        "content": "Yes, it is possible to force Keras with the TensorFlow backend to use the CPU even if you have CUDA installed. You can achieve this without installing a separate CPU-only TensorFlow version by setting an environment variable that TensorFlow uses to control device usage. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Set the Environment Variable:**\n   You can set the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable to an empty string to force TensorFlow to use the CPU. This can be done before you import TensorFlow or Keras in your script. Here's an example using Python:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = \"-1\"\n\n   import tensorflow as tf\n   from tensorflow import keras\n   ```\n\n   By setting `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to `-1`, you're instructing TensorFlow to ignore all GPU devices, thereby forcing it to run on the CPU.\n\n2. **Configure TensorFlow via Code:**\n   Alternatively, you can configure TensorFlow to use only the CPU within your code by setting the appropriate flags:\n\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n\n   # Disable all GPUS\n   tf.config.set_visible_devices([], 'GPU')\n   ```\n\n   This code snippet disables all GPU devices for TensorFlow, which will make it run on the CPU.\n\nThese methods allow you to control whether TensorFlow uses the GPU or CPU without needing to install a separate version of TensorFlow."
