Here's how you can rewrite your conditional statement in a more Pythonic way:\n\n```python\nbc = 'on' if c.page == 'blog' else 'off'\nprint(bc)\n```\n\nThis single line of code achieves the same result by using the ternary conditional operator, which is a more concise way to assign a value based on a condition."
