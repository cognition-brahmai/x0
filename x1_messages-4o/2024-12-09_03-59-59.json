In the following code:\n\n```python\nclass A:\n     var=0\n     list=[]\n     def __init__(self):\n            pass\n```\nI was surprised to find that `var` and `list` are shared across all instances of the class. I initially thought they would be different for each instance. It took me some time to realize this, and I'm finding it hard to understand why a variable, although accessed by a class object only, is shared across all instances. Could someone explain why this happens?"

        "content": "In Python, understanding how class variables and instance variables work is crucial, especially if you're coming from a C++ background, where the behavior is slightly different.\n\nIn your Python code:\n\n```python\nclass A:\n    var = 0\n    list = []\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n```\n\n`var` and `list` are class variables. This means they are shared among all instances of the class. Every instance of the class `A` will have access to these variables, and changes made to these variables will be reflected across all instances.\n\nHere's why this happens:\n\n1. **Class Variables**: In Python, variables defined within a class but outside of any methods (like `var` and `list` in your example) are class variables. They are shared because they are bound to the class itself, not to any particular instance of the class. This is similar to static variables in C++.\n\n2. **Instance Variables**: If you want each instance of a class to have its own separate copy of a variable, you need to define it within the `__init__` method. This makes it an instance variable, which is unique to each instance.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use instance variables:\n\n```python\nclass A:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.var = 0\n        self.list = []\n\n# Usage\na1 = A()\na2 = A()\na1.var = 1\na1.list.append(1)\n\nprint(a1.var)  # Output: 1\nprint(a2.var)  # Output: 0\n\nprint(a1.list)  # Output: [1]\nprint(a2.list)  # Output: []\n```\n\nIn this modified version, `var` and `list` are instance variables, so they are not shared between instances. Each instance of `A` will have its own `var` and `list`."
