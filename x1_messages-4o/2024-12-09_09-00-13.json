        "content": "To write a Python program that generates multiplication tables from 1 to 10, you can use nested loops. Here's a simple example of how you can do this:\n\n```python\n# Function to print multiplication tables from 1 to 10\ndef print_multiplication_tables():\n    for i in range(1, 11):  # Outer loop for numbers 1 to 10\n        print(f\"Multiplication Table for {i}:\")\n        for j in range(1, 11):  # Inner loop for multiplying with numbers 1 to 10\n            product = i * j\n            print(f\"{i} x {j} = {product}\")\n        print()  # Blank line for better readability between tables\n\n# Call the function\nprint_multiplication_tables()\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `print_multiplication_tables()` that uses two nested loops. The outer loop iterates through numbers 1 to 10, and for each number, the inner loop iterates through numbers 1 to 10 as well, calculating and printing the product of these numbers. The use of `print()` statements ensures that each step of the multiplication is printed, creating a clear and organized multiplication table for each number from 1 to 10."
