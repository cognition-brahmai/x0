Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming df is your original DataFrame and 's' is the threshold value\ns = 100  # replace with your desired threshold value\n\n# First DataFrame with 'Sales' less than 's'\ndf_less_than_s = df[df['Sales'] < s]\n\n# Second DataFrame with 'Sales' greater than or equal to 's'\ndf_greater_than_or_equal_s = df[df['Sales'] >= s]\n\n# Displaying the resulting DataFrames\nprint(\"DataFrame with Sales < s:\")\nprint(df_less_than_s)\n\nprint(\"\\nDataFrame with Sales >= s:\")\nprint(df_greater_than_or_equal_s)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what the code does:\n\n- `df[df['Sales'] < s]` creates a DataFrame containing only the rows where the 'Sales' column is less than the value of `s`.\n- `df[df['Sales'] >= s]` creates a DataFrame containing only the rows where the 'Sales' column is greater than or equal to the value of `s`.\n\nBy executing this code, you'll have two separate DataFrames based on the specified condition."
