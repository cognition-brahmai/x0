When I write code, for instance, after 'else:', upon pressing enter, it doesn't automatically indent like in Python's IDLE. Here is an example of what I want:\n\n```python\nelse:  \n    name = 'World'\n    print 'Howdy', name\n    print 'yay'\n```\n\nBut in Notepad++, when I press enter after 'else:', the cursor aligns with 'else:' instead of being indented. Here is what it looks like:\n\n```python\nelse: # i press enter and this is what it does\nlands me here\n```\n\nI want it to be like it is in IDLE where after the ':' I can just press enter and the cursor is indented on the next line. I have set my filetype to Python and the format to Unix."

        "content": "Notepad++ does not have built-in automatic indentation specifically tailored for Python like some other dedicated Python IDEs do. However, you can achieve a similar effect by using a plugin or configuring some settings. Here\u2019s how you can set up automatic indentation for Python in Notepad++:\n\n### Method 1: Using the Python Script Plugin\n\n1. **Install Python Script Plugin:**\n   - Open Notepad++.\n   - Go to `Plugins` > `Plugin Admin`.\n   - Search for `Python Script` and install it. Restart Notepad++ if necessary.\n\n2. **Create an Auto Indent Script:**\n   - Go to `Plugins` > `Python Script` > `New Script`.\n   - Name your script something like `AutoIndent.py`.\n   - Paste the following script into the editor:\n\n     ```python\n     editor.autoCSetIgnoreCase(True)\n     editor.autoCSetSeparator(ord('\\n'))\n     editor.autoCSetMaxHeight(10)\n\n     def on_char_added(args):\n         char = chr(args['ch'])\n         if char == ':':\n             line = editor.getCurLine()\n             pos = editor.getCurrentPos()\n             editor.insertText(pos, '\\n    ')\n             editor.gotoPos(pos + 5)\n\n     editor.callback(on_char_added, [SCINTILLANOTIFICATION.CHARADDED])\n     ```\n\n   - Save the script.\n\n3. **Enable the Script:**\n   - Go back to `Plugins` > `Python Script` > `Scripts`.\n   - Select the script you just created to activate it.\n\n### Method 2: Configure Smart Indent Manually\n\n1. **Enable Tab Settings:**\n   - Go to `Settings` > `Preferences`.\n   - In the `Preferences` dialog, go to `Language` > `Tab Settings`.\n   - Select `Python` from the list.\n   - Ensure `Use default value` is unchecked.\n   - Set `Tab size` and `Indent size` to your desired number of spaces (commonly 4).\n   - Check `Replace by space`.\n\n2. **Use Python Indent Plugin:**\n   - Although there's no direct plugin for auto-indentation, some users create macros or custom scripts to handle indentation. You can search online for community-created scripts that might suit your needs.\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- **Use External Tools:** Consider using an IDE like PyCharm, VSCode, or even Sublime Text, which have built-in support for Python and automatic indentation.\n- **Configure Custom Shortcuts:** You can configure custom shortcuts or snippets in Notepad++ to help with repetitive code patterns, although they won't be automatic.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to achieve a more seamless coding experience in Notepad++ similar to what you experience in Python's IDLE."
