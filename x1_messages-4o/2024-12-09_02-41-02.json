When I try to call `$ pip`, I receive the following error message:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/local/bin/pip\", line 5, in <module>\n    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point\n  File \"/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/pkg_resources.py\", line 2603, in <module>\n    working_set.require(__requires__)\n  File \"/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/pkg_resources.py\", line 666, in require\n    needed = self.resolve(parse_requirements(requirements))\n  File \"/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/pkg_resources.py\", line 565, in resolve\n    raise DistributionNotFound(req)  # XXX put more info here\npkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: pip==1.1\n```\nI attempted to reinstall pip using the install procedure again and `easy_install` but the same error occurred. Interestingly, when I use `sudo pip`, the error doesn't appear. However, I noticed that the directories in the error message point to /System/Library/... while my Python installation is located in /Library/Frameworks/.. as shown when I used command `$ which python`. How can I fix this issue so I won't have to use sudo?"

        "content": "It looks like there might be some confusion between the system's default Python installation and the one you have installed separately. This is a common issue on macOS, especially when using system-installed Python along with a separate Python installation. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Your Python Version:**\n   Make sure you are using the correct version of Python. You can do this by running:\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   which python\n   ```\n\n   If the `which python` command points to a different path than `/Library/Frameworks/...`, you might need to adjust your PATH variable.\n\n2. **Update Your PATH:**\n   Make sure your PATH environment variable includes the path to your installed Python version before the system's default Python. You can update your PATH by adding the following line to your `~/.bash_profile` (or `~/.zshrc` if you are using zsh):\n\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=\"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:$PATH\"\n   ```\n\n   After making changes, reload your profile:\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bash_profile\n   ```\n\n3. **Reinstall Pip:**\n   Once you are sure that you are using the correct Python version, try reinstalling pip using the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py\n   python get-pip.py --user\n   ```\n\n   The `--user` flag ensures that pip is installed locally for your user account, avoiding the need for `sudo`.\n\n4. **Verify Pip Installation:**\n   After installation, verify that pip is installed correctly by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip --version\n   which pip\n   ```\n\n   Ensure that `which pip` points to a location under your user's directory and not the system directory.\n\n5. **Use Virtual Environments:**\n   To avoid similar issues in the future, consider using Python virtual environments. They help manage dependencies and ensure that your development environment is isolated. You can set up a virtual environment using:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n   This creates an isolated environment where you can install packages without affecting the system Python installation.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to use pip without needing `sudo` and have it correctly reference your installed Python version."
