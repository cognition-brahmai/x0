I want to compare a list of objects with another list of objects to verify if the objects in the first list match my expectations. I am looking to write a custom .assertFoo() method to accomplish this. What should this method do exactly? Should it raise an exception when a test fails? If so, what kind of exception should it raise and how do I pass an error message to it? Should this error message be a unicode string or a bytestring? I have not been able to find guidance on how to write custom assertion methods in the official documentation. Also, I would like this method to compare all objects unconditionally and display all objects that failed, instead of just the first one. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "Creating a custom assertion method for comparing lists of objects in Python's `unittest` framework involves defining a method that checks each item in the lists and raises an assertion error if the test fails. Here\u2019s how you can implement such a method:\n\n### Steps to Write a Custom Assertion Method\n\n1. **Define a Method:**\n   Create a method in your test case class, typically starting with `assert` (e.g., `assertListOfObjectsEqual`). This method will take two lists of objects as arguments.\n\n2. **Iterate and Compare:**\n   Iterate over both lists and compare each corresponding object. You can use a loop for this purpose.\n\n3. **Collect Errors:**\n   Instead of stopping at the first mismatch, collect all mismatches in a list or similar data structure.\n\n4. **Raise Assertion Error:**\n   If there are mismatches, raise an `AssertionError` with a message detailing all mismatches. The `AssertionError` is the standard exception for assertion failures in Python.\n\n5. **Unicode Strings for Messages:**\n   Use unicode strings for error messages to ensure compatibility with Python 3, which handles strings as unicode by default.\n\nHere is an example implementation:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\nclass CustomTestCase(unittest.TestCase):\n    \n    def assertListOfObjectsEqual(self, list1, list2, msg=None):\n        \"\"\"Custom assertion to check if two lists of objects are equal.\"\"\"\n        mismatches = []\n        \n        # Check if lists are of the same length\n        if len(list1) != len(list2):\n            mismatches.append(f\"Different lengths: {len(list1)} != {len(list2)}\")\n        \n        # Compare each object\n        for i, (obj1, obj2) in enumerate(zip(list1, list2)):\n            if obj1 != obj2:\n                mismatches.append(f\"Index {i}: {obj1} != {obj2}\")\n        \n        # If there are mismatches, raise an AssertionError\n        if mismatches:\n            standard_msg = '\\n'.join(mismatches)\n            if msg:\n                standard_msg = f\"{msg}\\n{standard_msg}\"\n            raise AssertionError(standard_msg)\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Error Handling:** Use `AssertionError` for failing tests. This is consistent with the behavior of built-in `unittest` assertions.\n  \n- **Message String Type:** Use unicode strings (`str` in Python 3) for error messages to ensure compatibility and avoid encoding issues.\n\n- **Complete Comparison:** By collecting all mismatches in a list, you ensure that all objects are compared and all issues are reported, which aligns with your requirement to display all failed comparisons.\n\n### Usage Example\n\n```python\nclass TestMyApplication(CustomTestCase):\n    \n    def test_objects(self):\n        expected = [MyObject(1), MyObject(2), MyObject(3)]\n        actual = [MyObject(1), MyObject(2), MyObject(4)]  # Intentional mismatch\n        \n        self.assertListOfObjectsEqual(expected, actual, \"Objects did not match.\")\n```\n\nThis approach customizes your testing suite to better handle specific comparison logic, providing detailed feedback on test failures."
