        "content": "To create a 2-D `torch.Tensor` with a specified size `[a, b]` filled with values drawn from a uniform distribution within a range `[r1, r2]` using PyTorch, you can use the `torch.empty()` method combined with the `uniform_()` method. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\n# Define the dimensions of the tensor and the range of the uniform distribution\na = 3  # number of rows\nb = 4  # number of columns\nr1 = 0.0  # lower bound of the uniform distribution\nr2 = 1.0  # upper bound of the uniform distribution\n\n# Create an empty tensor of the desired size [a, b]\ntensor = torch.empty(a, b)\n\n# Fill the tensor with values drawn from a uniform distribution [r1, r2]\ntensor.uniform_(r1, r2)\n\nprint(tensor)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `torch.empty(a, b)` creates an uninitialized 2-D tensor of size `[a, b]`.\n- `uniform_(r1, r2)` fills the tensor with values sampled from a uniform distribution ranging from `r1` to `r2`.\n\nThis approach is efficient and leverages PyTorch's built-in methods to generate a tensor with random values from a specified uniform distribution range."
