I am attempting to write a simple dictionary to a JSON file using Python, but I keep encountering a \"TypeError: 1425 is not JSON serializable\" error. Here is the code that I am using:\n\n```python\nimport json\nalerts = {'upper':[1425],'lower':[576],'level':[2],'datetime':['2012-08-08 15:30']}\nafile = open('test.json','w')\nafile.write(json.dumps(alerts,encoding='UTF-8'))\nafile.close()\n```\n\nIf I add the 'default' argument, then it writes, but the integer values are written to the JSON file as strings, which I want to avoid. \n\n```python\nafile.write(json.dumps(alerts,encoding='UTF-8',default=str))\n```\n\nHow can I solve this TypeError issue without converting the integer values to strings?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with `TypeError: 1425 is not JSON serializable` is likely due to the use of the `encoding` parameter in the `json.dumps()` function, which is not valid in Python 3. The `encoding` parameter was used in Python 2, but it has been removed in Python 3 since all strings are Unicode by default.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to correctly serialize your dictionary to JSON without converting integers to strings:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\nalerts = {'upper': [1425], 'lower': [576], 'level': [2], 'datetime': ['2012-08-08 15:30']}\n\n# Open the file using a with statement to ensure it's properly closed\nwith open('test.json', 'w', encoding='UTF-8') as afile:\n    # Directly use json.dumps without the encoding parameter\n    json.dump(alerts, afile, ensure_ascii=False)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Remove the `encoding` parameter**: Since you are using Python 3, you don't need to specify `encoding='UTF-8'` in `json.dumps()`.\n   \n2. **Use `with` statement for file handling**: This ensures that the file is properly closed even if an error occurs.\n\n3. **Use `json.dump()` instead of `json.dumps()`**: When writing to a file, `json.dump()` is more appropriate as it directly writes the JSON to the file object instead of first creating a string with `json.dumps()` and then writing it to a file.\n\nThese changes should resolve the `TypeError` and ensure that your integers are correctly serialized as integers in the JSON file."
