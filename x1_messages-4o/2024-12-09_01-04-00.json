        "content": "To parse a tab-separated file in Python where each number placed `k` tabs apart from the beginning of a row should be placed into the `k-th` array, you can use the built-in `csv` module which supports tab-delimited files. This method is more efficient than manually processing each line and offers a straightforward approach.\n\nHere's a step-by-step implementation:\n\n1. Use the `csv.reader` with the `delimiter` parameter set to `\\t` to handle tab-separated values.\n2. Initialize a list of lists to store the numbers in respective arrays.\n3. Iterate over each row and append the numbers to the corresponding index arrays.\n\nHere's a sample code to demonstrate the process:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\ndef parse_tsv_to_arrays(file_path):\n    arrays = []\n    \n    with open(file_path, 'r', newline='') as file:\n        reader = csv.reader(file, delimiter='\\t')\n        \n        for row in reader:\n            # Extend the arrays list if the row is longer than the current list\n            while len(arrays) < len(row):\n                arrays.append([])\n\n            for i, value in enumerate(row):\n                arrays[i].append(value)\n\n    return arrays\n\n# Example usage\nfile_path = 'example.tsv'\narrays = parse_tsv_to_arrays(file_path)\nfor i, array in enumerate(arrays):\n    print(f\"Array {i}: {array}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **CSV Module**: The `csv` module is used with `delimiter='\\t'` to indicate that the file is tab-separated.\n- **Dynamic Array Extension**: The `arrays` list is extended dynamically to ensure it can accommodate rows of varying lengths.\n- **Appending Values**: Each value from the row is appended to the corresponding list in `arrays`.\n\nThis method efficiently handles the parsing of tab-separated files and organizes the data into separate arrays based on their position in the rows."
