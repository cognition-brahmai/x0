        "content": "In PyCharm, is it possible to disable an inspection for the entire file? I am dealing with py.test which uses fixtures that seem to shadow function parameters, causing unresolved references. For instance, with the following code: \n\n```\nfrom myfixtures import user  # Unused import statement warning\n\ndef test_is_awesome(user):  # Shadows name 'user' from outer scope warning\n    assert user.is_awesome()\n```\n\nI receive warnings such as \"Unused import statement\" and \"Shadows name 'user' from outer scope\". Additionally, using `pytest.raises()` results in a \"Can not find reference 'raises'\" in pytest.py. Is there another way to fix these problems or am I possibly using py.test incorrectly?"

        "content": "Yes, you can disable inspections in PyCharm for an entire file if you are encountering warnings that you want to suppress. Here are a few ways you can handle the situation:\n\n### Disabling Inspections for the Entire File\n1. **Suppress for the File:**\n   - You can add a comment at the top of the file to suppress specific inspections. For example, to suppress the \"Unused import statement\" warning, you can add:\n     ```python\n     # noinspection PyUnresolvedReferences,PyShadowingNames\n     ```\n\n2. **Customize Settings:**\n   - Go to `File` -> `Settings` (or `PyCharm` -> `Preferences` on macOS).\n   - Navigate to `Editor` -> `Inspections`.\n   - You can search for the specific inspection, such as \"Unused import statement\" or \"Shadowing names\", and uncheck it or adjust its severity level.\n\n3. **Suppress Specific Warnings:**\n   - You can also suppress specific warnings by using PyCharm's `#noinspection` comment just before the line that causes the warning. This is useful when you want to suppress specific warnings without affecting the whole file.\n     ```python\n     # noinspection PyUnresolvedReferences\n     from myfixtures import user \n\n     # noinspection PyShadowingNames\n     def test_is_awesome(user):\n         assert user.is_awesome()\n     ```\n\n### Addressing `pytest.raises()` Issue\n- Ensure that PyCharm recognizes the pytest module. You might want to check your project interpreter settings and ensure that pytest is installed in the environment you are using.\n- You can also try invalidating caches and restarting PyCharm to see if it resolves the issue. This can be done by going to `File` -> `Invalidate Caches / Restart`.\n\n### Using Pytest Correctly\n- Make sure that your `conftest.py` file is correctly set up if you are using it to declare fixtures.\n- Ensure that your test discovery is configured correctly in PyCharm. You can do this by going to `Run` -> `Edit Configurations` and checking the configuration for pytest.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to manage the warnings and ensure that PyCharm is set up correctly for working with pytest."
