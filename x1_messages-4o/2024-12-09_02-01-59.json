        "content": "In Keras, while there isn't a specific \"split\" layer, you can achieve the desired splitting of a tensor using the `Lambda` layer along with TensorFlow's slicing capabilities. You can utilize the `tf.keras.layers.Lambda` layer to split the tensor into separate tensors. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Lambda, Input\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Model\n\n# Example input layer\ninput_tensor = Input(shape=(4, None, None))\n\n# Function to split the tensor\ndef split_tensor(index):\n    return lambda x: x[:, index, :, :]\n\n# Create four separate layers from the input tensor\nsplit_layers = [Lambda(split_tensor(i))(input_tensor) for i in range(4)]\n\n# Create models for demonstration\nmodels = [Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=split_layer) for split_layer in split_layers]\n\n# Each model will output one of the (1, x, y) slices\nfor i, model in enumerate(models):\n    print(f\"Model {i+1} output shape: {model.output_shape}\")\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a `split_tensor` function that uses a lambda function to slice the input tensor along the first dimension. We then create a list of `Lambda` layers, each slicing the tensor at a different index. Finally, four separate models are created, each taking the same input tensor and outputting one of the slices. This approach effectively splits the original tensor into four separate tensors with the shape `(1, x, y)` each."
