The environment is Linux Mint 17 Cinnamon and the packages include lxml, pillow, pycrypto and pymongo. I found some solutions suggesting the installation of python2.7-dev, but I am hesitant as I understand this would affect the system's Python instance, not the one in the virtual environment. Is there a way to add python2.7-dev just to the virtual environment version of Python?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering typically indicates that the build process for a Python package is failing because the necessary development headers and libraries for building C extensions are not available. In the case of Python packages like `lxml`, `pillow`, and `pycrypto`, these often require compiling C code, which in turn requires the appropriate headers and libraries.\n\nWhen you install `python2.7-dev`, you're essentially installing the development headers and libraries for Python 2.7, which are needed to compile Python C extensions. It's common to do this at the system level because these headers and libraries are used by the system's GCC compiler when building C extensions, even when you're working within a virtual environment.\n\nVirtual environments in Python are designed to provide isolated environments for Python packages, but they still rely on the system's compiler and development tools to build packages that include C extensions. Therefore, installing `python2.7-dev` at the system level is the standard approach and will not directly affect the version of Python or the packages installed within your virtual environment.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can install `python2.7-dev` and resolve your issue:\n\n1. Open a terminal and run the following command to install the development package:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install python2.7-dev\n   ```\n\n2. After installing `python2.7-dev`, activate your virtual environment and try installing your packages again using pip:\n   ```bash\n   source /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate\n   pip install lxml pillow pycrypto pymongo\n   ```\n\n3. If you continue to experience issues, you might also need to install additional development tools and libraries, such as `build-essential` or specific libraries like `libxml2-dev` and `libxslt1-dev` for `lxml`:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install build-essential libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev\n   ```\n\nBy installing `python2.7-dev` and any other necessary development packages at the system level, you should be able to successfully compile and install the packages you're trying to use in your virtual environment."
