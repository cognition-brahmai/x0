I'm wondering whether it's enough to just close the connection like this:\n\n```python\nconnection.close()\n```\n\nOr, should I close the cursor first, and then close the connection like this:\n\n```python\ncursor.close()\nconnection.close()\n```\n\nWhich way is appropriate?"

        "content": "When using MySQLdb or similar database libraries in Python, it's considered good practice to close both the cursor and the connection when you're done with them. This ensures that all resources are properly released and that you don't run into any resource leaks or other unexpected issues. \n\nHere's the recommended approach:\n\n1. **Close the cursor first**: This releases any resources associated specifically with the cursor, such as query results.\n\n2. **Then close the connection**: This ensures that the connection to the database server is properly terminated.\n\nSo, your code should look like this:\n\n```python\ncursor.close()\nconnection.close()\n```\n\nWhile some database libraries automatically close the cursor when the connection is closed, explicitly closing the cursor helps make your code more robust and clear, especially if you're working in an environment where resource management is critical. It also ensures compatibility with different database libraries and future-proofing your code."
