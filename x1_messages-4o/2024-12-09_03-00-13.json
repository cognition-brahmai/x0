I have the following code:\n\n```python\ns = [1,2,3]\nt = reversed(s)\n\nfor i in t:\n    print(i)\n# output: 3,2,1\n```\n\nWhen I pop an element from the original list 's', the reversed list 't' becomes empty:\n\n```python\ns = [1,2,3]\nt = reversed(s)\ns.pop()\n\nfor i in t:\n    print(i)\n# expected output: 2, 1\n# actual output (nothing): \n```\n\nWhy does this happen?"

        "content": "This behavior occurs because the `reversed()` function returns an iterator that directly references the original list. When you perform operations on the original list, such as popping an element, it affects the iterator as well.\n\nIn your code, when you create `t = reversed(s)`, `t` becomes an iterator that points to the elements of `s` in reverse order. However, when you perform `s.pop()`, it modifies the original list `s` by removing the last element. Since `t` is referencing `s`, the iterator `t` is also affected by this change, resulting in an empty iteration when you try to loop through `t`.\n\nTo achieve the behavior you expect (i.e., having a reversed snapshot of the list before the pop operation), you should convert the reversed iterator to a list. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ns = [1, 2, 3]\nt = list(reversed(s))  # Convert to list to create a snapshot\n\ns.pop()  # Modify the original list\n\nfor i in t:\n    print(i)\n# Output: 3, 2, 1\n```\n\nBy converting `reversed(s)` to a list, you create a separate copy of the reversed list, which is not affected by subsequent modifications to the original list `s`."
