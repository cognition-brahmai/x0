Here's how you can do it:\n\nAssuming your data is structured as follows in Excel:\n\n- \"Id\" is in column A\n- \"Name\" is in column B\n- \"Age\" is in column C\n\nAnd your data starts from row 2, with headers in row 1.\n\nYou would enter the following formula in a cell where you want the average age to be displayed:\n\n```excel\n=AVERAGE(C2:C6)\n```\n\nHere's what each part of the formula means:\n\n- `AVERAGE`: This is the function that calculates the average of a set of numbers.\n- `C2:C6`: This is the range of cells that contains the ages you want to average. In your case, it includes cells from C2 to C6.\n\nOnce you enter the formula, press Enter, and Excel will calculate the average age for you."
