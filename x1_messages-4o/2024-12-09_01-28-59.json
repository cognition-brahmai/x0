The issue I am facing is that Docker runs this command every time I build the image, irrespective of whether there have been any changes to the `requirements.txt` file. How can I modify the Dockerfile such that Docker only runs `pip install -r requirements.txt` if there have been changes to the `requirements.txt` file? \n\nHere is the relevant code from my Dockerfile:\n\n```Dockerfile\nFROM python:2.7\nRUN pip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nWhen I run the Docker build process, I get the following output, which shows Docker running the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command:\n\n```Dockerfile\nRemoving intermediate container f98c845d0f05\nStep 3 : RUN pip install -r requirements.txt\n ---> Running in 8ceb63abaef6\nCollecting https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/archive/master.zip (from -r requirements.txt (line 30))\nDownloading https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/archive/master.zip\nCollecting Django==1.8.7 (from -r requirements.txt (line 1))\n```"

        "content": "To optimize your Docker build process and ensure that `pip install -r requirements.txt` is only run when there are changes in the `requirements.txt` file, you can take advantage of Docker's caching mechanism by modifying the Dockerfile. The key is to copy the `requirements.txt` file first before installing the dependencies. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```Dockerfile\nFROM python:2.7\n\n# Set a working directory\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Copy only the requirements.txt file first\nCOPY requirements.txt .\n\n# Install the dependencies\nRUN pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# Now copy the rest of your application code\nCOPY . .\n\n# Other commands like setting entry points, environment variables, etc.\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Separate COPY Instructions**: By copying the `requirements.txt` file separately before copying the rest of your application code, you create a separate layer in the Docker image. Docker caches layers, so if the `requirements.txt` file hasn't changed, Docker will use the cached layer instead of re-running the `pip install` command.\n\n2. **Order Matters**: Make sure to copy your application code after installing the dependencies. This ensures that changes in your application code do not invalidate the cache for the `pip install` layer.\n\n### Benefits:\n\n- **Faster Builds**: By reducing unnecessary installations, the build process becomes faster.\n- **Efficient Caching**: You make better use of Docker's caching, leading to more efficient builds.\n\nThis approach leverages Docker's layer caching to optimize the build process, ensuring that `pip install -r requirements.txt` is only executed when there's an actual change in the `requirements.txt`."
