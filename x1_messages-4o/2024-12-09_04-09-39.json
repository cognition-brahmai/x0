I tried a solution from a previous Stack Overflow question but it didn't work for me. Here is an example of what the code looks like now. How can I revert the .py file back to .ipynb without manually copying and pasting the code which would take hours due to the volume of the code?"

        "content": "To convert a Python script (.py) back into a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb), you can use the `nbformat` library in Python. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you with the conversion:\n\n1. **Install nbformat**: If you haven't already installed the `nbformat` library, you can do so using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install nbformat\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a Python script to convert the .py file to .ipynb**: Save the following script as `convert_py_to_ipynb.py`:\n\n   ```python\n   import nbformat as nbf\n\n   # Path to the .py file you want to convert\n   py_file_path = 'your_script.py'  # Replace with your .py file path\n   # Path where you want to save the .ipynb file\n   ipynb_file_path = 'your_notebook.ipynb'  # Replace with your desired .ipynb file path\n\n   # Read the .py file content\n   with open(py_file_path, 'r') as f:\n       py_content = f.read()\n\n   # Create a new Jupyter Notebook\n   nb = nbf.v4.new_notebook()\n\n   # Split the .py content into cells based on lines starting with '# In[' or similar\n   cells = []\n   for line in py_content.splitlines():\n       # Check if the line is a cell delimiter\n       if line.startswith('# In[') or line.startswith('# #'):\n           # Start a new cell\n           cells.append('')\n       # Add the line to the current cell\n       if cells:\n           cells[-1] += line + '\\n'\n       else:\n           cells.append(line + '\\n')\n   \n   # Add each cell to the notebook\n   for cell_content in cells:\n       nb.cells.append(nbf.v4.new_code_cell(cell_content))\n\n   # Write the notebook to a file\n   with open(ipynb_file_path, 'w') as f:\n       nbf.write(nb, f)\n\n   print(f\"Converted {py_file_path} to {ipynb_file_path}.\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Run the script**: Modify the `py_file_path` and `ipynb_file_path` variables in the script to point to your .py file and the desired output .ipynb file. Then run the script from the command line:\n\n   ```bash\n   python convert_py_to_ipynb.py\n   ```\n\nThis script will parse the .py file, split it into cells, and write it to a new .ipynb file. Note that this simple script assumes that each block of code should be its own cell. If your .py file contains specific comments or delimiters to denote cell boundaries, you might need to adjust the script accordingly.\n\nIf the structure of your .py file is different, or if it contains specific cell markers, you'll need to adjust the logic in the script to correctly parse and convert the file into notebook cells."
