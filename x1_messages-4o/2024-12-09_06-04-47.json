I would like it to work on both Mac OS X (10.4) and Windows XP, and ideally, I would be able to just drop it into the source directory of my project. I found a library by Josh Davis but I'm unsure about its quality and if it supports the required CBC cipher mode. Can anyone suggest a suitable Python library?"

        "content": "For your requirements, you can consider using the `pycryptodome` library, which is a self-contained Python package that is a fork of the `PyCrypto` library. It is pure Python and provides AES 256 encryption and decryption with support for the CBC mode and PKCS7 padding. Here's how you can use it:\n\n1. **Installation**: You can install `pycryptodome` via pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pycryptodome\n   ```\n\n2. **Usage**: Here is an example of how you can use `pycryptodome` to perform AES encryption and decryption with CBC mode and PKCS7 padding:\n\n   ```python\n   from Crypto.Cipher import AES\n   from Crypto.Util.Padding import pad, unpad\n   from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes\n\n   # Key and IV should be 16, 24, or 32 bytes long for AES-128, AES-192, AES-256 respectively\n   key = get_random_bytes(32)  # AES-256 requires a 32-byte key\n   iv = get_random_bytes(16)   # CBC mode requires an initialization vector\n\n   # Data to encrypt\n   data = b'This is some data to encrypt'\n\n   # Encrypt\n   cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)\n   ct_bytes = cipher.encrypt(pad(data, AES.block_size))\n\n   # Decrypt\n   cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)\n   pt = unpad(cipher.decrypt(ct_bytes), AES.block_size)\n\n   print(\"Ciphertext:\", ct_bytes)\n   print(\"Plaintext:\", pt.decode('utf-8'))\n   ```\n\nThis example demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt data using AES with CBC mode and PKCS7 padding. `pycryptodome` does not have external dependencies and should work on both Mac OS X and Windows XP, meeting your requirement of being easily integrated by dropping it into your source directory.\n\nMake sure to manage your keys and IVs securely, as they are critical for the security of your encryption scheme."
