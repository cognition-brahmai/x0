I followed the instructions on the Git setup page, but every time I try to push changes with `git push origin master`, I get an error: `git: 'credential-cache' is not a git command. See 'get --help'`. I am then forced to enter my username and password again. The same error message appears even after I enter my credentials. Here is what my .gitconfig file looks like:\n\n```\n[user]\n    name = myusername\n    email = myusername@myemaildomain.com\n[credential]\n    helper = cache\n```\n\nAfter installing Git and running Git Bash, this is what I entered:\n\n```\ngit config --global user.name \"myusername\"\ngit config --global user.email \"myusername@myemaildomain.com\"\ngit config --global credential.helper cache\n```\n\nWhat could be causing this issue?"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering suggests that there might be an issue with the credential helper configuration. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Git is Up-to-Date**: Make sure you have the latest version of Git installed. Older versions might not support certain features or have bugs that have been fixed in later releases.\n\n2. **Correct Credential Helper Configuration**: The error message suggests that Git cannot find the `credential-cache` helper. Ensure that it's configured correctly. You can try using `cache --timeout=3600` to specify a timeout for the cache (in seconds). This would cache your credentials for one hour:\n\n   ```bash\n   git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'\n   ```\n\n3. **Use the Correct Command**: Double-check that you're using the correct command. The error message mentions `credential-cache`, which should be `credential.helper cache`.\n\n4. **Use Alternative Credential Helpers**: If caching doesn't work as expected, consider using other credential helpers like `store` or `manager-core`. For instance:\n\n   - `store` will save your credentials in a plain-text file (less secure but persistent):\n\n     ```bash\n     git config --global credential.helper store\n     ```\n\n   - `manager-core` is a more secure option if you're on Windows or macOS:\n\n     ```bash\n     git config --global credential.helper manager-core\n     ```\n\n5. **Check for Multiple Configurations**: Ensure there's no conflicting Git configuration in other Git configuration files. You can check the system and local levels:\n\n   ```bash\n   git config --list --show-origin\n   ```\n\n   This will show you all the configurations and where they are set, helping you identify any conflicts.\n\n6. **Verify Git Installation**: Make sure Git is installed correctly and the `git` command is accessible from your terminal. You can verify this with:\n\n   ```bash\n   git --version\n   ```\n\n7. **Reset Configuration**: If nothing else works, consider resetting your Git configuration and setting it up again:\n\n   ```bash\n   git config --global --unset credential.helper\n   git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'\n   ```\n\nTry these steps and see if it resolves your issue. If the problem persists, there might be an issue with your Git installation, in which case reinstalling Git might help."
