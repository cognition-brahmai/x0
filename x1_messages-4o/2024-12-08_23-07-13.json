With a 20% discount, you save 20% of $120, which is:\n\n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 120 = 24\n   \\]\n\n2. Subtract the discount from the original price to find the discounted price:\n\n   \\[\n   120 - 24 = 96\n   \\]\n\n3. Add the shipping fee to the discounted price:\n\n   \\[\n   96 + 10 = 106\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, you will end up paying $106 for the gift."
