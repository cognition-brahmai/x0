In the following code, I set the level of the handler to logging.DEBUG. \n\n```python\nimport logging\nimport logging.handlers\n\na = logging.getLogger('myapp')\nh = logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler('foo.log')\nh.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\na.addHandler(h)\n\n# The effective log level is still logging.WARN\nprint(a.getEffectiveLevel()) \na.debug('foo message')\na.warn('warning message')\n```\n\nI initially expected that setting logging.DEBUG on the handler would lead to debug-level messages being written to the log file. But the output for the effective level is 30 (which equals logging.WARNING, the default), and only the warn message is logged to the file, not the debug message. It seems like the handler's log level is being ignored. So, I'm wondering what is the actual purpose of the setLevel method on the handler?"

        "content": "In Python's logging module, the `setLevel` method is used to set the threshold level for both loggers and handlers. However, the way these levels work together can be a bit confusing.\n\n### How Logging Levels Work in Python\n\n1. **Logger Level**: The logger's level acts as a filter for which messages are passed to its handlers. If a logger's level is set to `WARNING`, for instance, only messages of level `WARNING` and above (like `ERROR` and `CRITICAL`) will be processed and passed to its handlers.\n\n2. **Handler Level**: Once a message passes through the logger (meaning it meets the logger's level requirement), the handler's level determines whether the message is actually logged to its specific output (such as a file, console, etc.). If a handler's level is set to `DEBUG`, it will log all messages that reach it, because `DEBUG` is the lowest level.\n\n### Your Code Context\n\n- **Logger `a`**: In your code, the logger `a` is created with the default level of `WARNING` because you didn't explicitly set it. This is why `a.getEffectiveLevel()` returns `30`, which corresponds to `WARNING`.\n\n- **Handler `h`**: You set the level of the handler `h` to `DEBUG`. This means that if a message reaches the handler, it will log messages of level `DEBUG` and above.\n\n### Why Only the Warning Message is Logged\n\n- Since the logger `a` has a level of `WARNING`, it only allows messages of level `WARNING` and above to be passed to its handlers. That's why the `a.debug('foo message')` doesn't get logged. It gets filtered out before it ever reaches the handler, because it's below the logger's level threshold.\n\n- The `a.warn('warning message')` call, however, is at the `WARNING` level. It passes through the logger and gets sent to the handler `h`, which logs it because the handler's level is `DEBUG`, which allows all messages through.\n\n### To Log Debug Messages\n\nIf you want to log debug messages using your setup, you need to set the logger's level to `DEBUG` as well:\n\n```python\na.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n```\n\nBy doing this, the logger `a` will allow all messages of level `DEBUG` and above to be passed to its handlers, and since the handler `h` is already set to `DEBUG`, it will log all these messages.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe `setLevel` method on the handler is crucial when you have multiple handlers with different logging requirements, but it does not override the logger's level. Both levels work together to determine what gets logged and where."
