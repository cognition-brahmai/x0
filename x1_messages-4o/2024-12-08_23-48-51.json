This is because it has the highest accuracy at 95% and also has a relatively lower processing time of 3.5 hours compared to Approach 1 and Approach 3. Although it requires higher computational resources and is less efficient on longer audio files, the trade-off in accuracy and processing time makes it a preferable choice, especially in scenarios where accuracy is a critical factor."
