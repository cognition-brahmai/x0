I am using the threading module to run my `HTTPServer` in a separate thread and I want to stop serving requests when the main thread also shuts down. The Python documentation mentions that `BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer` is a subclass of `SocketServer.TCPServer`, which supports a `shutdown` method, but I can't find it in `HTTPServer`. Unfortunately, the `BaseHTTPServer` module doesn't have detailed documentation."

        "content": "To stop the `BaseHTTPServer.serve_forever()` method when your server is running in a separate thread, you indeed need to use the `shutdown` method provided by the `SocketServer.TCPServer` class, which `HTTPServer` inherits from. Even though this method isn't explicitly documented in `BaseHTTPServer`, it is available for use.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how you can implement this:\n\n1. **Ensure you're using Python 2.7 or newer**, as this version added the `shutdown` method to `SocketServer`.\n\n2. **Run the server in a separate thread**. You've mentioned that you are already using the `threading` module, so make sure your server is running in a thread.\n\n3. **Call the `shutdown` method** on your `HTTPServer` instance from the main thread or any other thread that's monitoring your application's state. This will safely stop the `serve_forever()` loop.\n\nHere's an example of how you might structure your code:\n\n```python\nimport threading\nfrom BaseHTTPServer import HTTPServer, BaseHTTPRequestHandler\n\nclass MyHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n    def do_GET(self):\n        self.send_response(200)\n        self.end_headers()\n        self.wfile.write(b\"Hello, world!\")\n\ndef run_server(server):\n    server.serve_forever()\n\n# Create server object\nserver_address = ('', 8000)\nhttpd = HTTPServer(server_address, MyHandler)\n\n# Start server in a new thread\nserver_thread = threading.Thread(target=run_server, args=(httpd,))\nserver_thread.start()\n\n# Your main program logic here...\ntry:\n    while True:\n        # Simulate main program running\n        pass\nexcept KeyboardInterrupt:\n    # Stop the server when you interrupt the program\n    print(\"Shutting down server...\")\n    httpd.shutdown()\n    server_thread.join()\n    print(\"Server stopped.\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Threading**: The server is run on a separate thread using `threading.Thread`.\n- **Shutdown**: The `shutdown()` method is called to stop the server, which will break the `serve_forever` loop.\n- **Join**: After calling `shutdown`, you should call `join()` on the server thread to ensure that it has finished shutting down before your program exits.\n\nThis approach ensures that your server stops accepting new requests and completes the processing of ongoing requests gracefully when you want to shut it down."
