Here's how you can modify your code to check if the key `'b'` exists in the dictionary `a`:\n\n```python\na = {}\n# Assuming some operations that might add keys to the dictionary\n\nif 'b' in a:\n    a['b'] = a['b'] + 1\nelse:\n    a['b'] = 1\n```\n\nIn this code snippet:\n\n- `if 'b' in a:` checks if the key `'b'` exists in dictionary `a`.\n- If `'b'` is a key in `a`, it increments its value by 1.\n- If `'b'` is not a key in `a`, it initializes the key `'b'` with the value `1`."
