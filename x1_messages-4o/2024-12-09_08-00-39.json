I am aware that a custom configuration can be added in the `launch.json` file using the `args` keyword. However, it becomes inconvenient to always modify the `launch.json` file whenever I want to use different arguments. Is there an alternative solution to this?"

        "content": "Yes, there is a simpler way to run a Python file with arguments in Visual Studio Code without constantly modifying the `launch.json` file. You can use the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code to execute your script with different arguments. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Open the Integrated Terminal**:\n   - You can open the terminal by going to the menu and selecting `View` > `Terminal`, or by using the shortcut `` Ctrl + ` `` (backtick).\n\n2. **Navigate to Your Script\u2019s Directory**:\n   - Use `cd` to navigate to the directory where your Python script is located if you're not already there.\n\n3. **Run the Script with Arguments**:\n   - You can directly run your Python script with arguments from the terminal using the Python command. For example:\n     ```bash\n     python your_script.py arg1 arg2 arg3\n     ```\n   - Make sure to replace `your_script.py` with the name of your script and `arg1 arg2 arg3` with the actual arguments you want to pass.\n\n4. **Use a Task (Optional)**:\n   - If you frequently use the same set of arguments, you can create a custom task in `tasks.json` to automate this process. This way, you can easily run the task without typing the command each time.\n\n5. **Debugging with Arguments (Alternative Method)**:\n   - If you need to debug with different arguments, you can still use the `launch.json` file. However, consider setting up multiple configurations with different arguments if certain argument sets are reused often.\n\nBy using the terminal, you have the flexibility to quickly change and test different arguments without modifying your `launch.json` file."
