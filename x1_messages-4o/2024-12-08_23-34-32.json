The database is stored in a SQL table named \"tigers\" with the following columns: \"id\", \"name\", \"eye_color\", \"weight\", and \"habitat\". \nIf I run a SQL query select eye_color from tigers where name = 'Bengal Tiger', the result will be \"yellow\". \nBut what about other tiger species? Is there a way to retrieve the eye color of all tiger species at once using SQL? What SQL query can I use to get a table with the following format? \nSpecies | Eye Color \n--------|----------\nBengal Tiger | Yellow \nSiberian Tiger | Blue \nSumatran Tiger | Green \nMalayan Tiger | Amber \nNote: This information is important for a research project that aims to study the correlation between a tiger's eye color and its habitat."

        "content": "To retrieve the eye color of all tiger species from the database in the desired format, you can use a SQL query that selects distinct combinations of species names and their corresponding eye colors from the table. However, if the table only contains individual tiger names and not species names, you would first need to ensure that each unique tiger name corresponds to a specific species. Assuming that each tiger's name in the \"name\" column uniquely identifies its species, you can use the following SQL query to achieve this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT name AS Species, eye_color AS \"Eye Color\"\nFROM tigers;\n```\n\nThis query selects the distinct pairs of \"name\" and \"eye_color\" from the \"tigers\" table and renames the columns to \"Species\" and \"Eye Color\" for clarity.\n\nIf the \"name\" column contains individual tiger names rather than species names, you would need additional data or a separate mapping table to map each individual name to its corresponding species to perform this query correctly."
