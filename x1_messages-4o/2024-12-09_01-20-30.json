The aim is to have the `Eye` class execute additional code (self.some_other_defined_stuff()), along with what `Frame` sets up. Here's the code I have:\n\n```python\nclass Frame:\n    def __init__(self, image):\n        self.image = image\n\nclass Eye(Frame):\n    def __init__(self, image):\n        super(Eye, self).__init__()\n        self.some_other_defined_stuff()\n```\n\nHowever, when I try to call `super(Eye, self).__init__()` to initialize the parent class, I get a `TypeError: must be type, not classobj`. I am not able to understand why this error is occurring. Could you please explain the cause of the error and how to solve it?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the way classes are defined in Python 2.x. In Python 2, there are two types of classes: \"old-style\" classes and \"new-style\" classes. The primary difference is that new-style classes inherit from `object`, whereas old-style classes do not. The `super()` function only works with new-style classes.\n\nIn your code, `Frame` is an old-style class because it does not explicitly inherit from `object`. This is why you're seeing the error `TypeError: must be type, not classobj` when trying to use `super()`.\n\nTo fix this issue, you need to make `Frame` a new-style class by inheriting from `object`. Here is the corrected code:\n\n```python\nclass Frame(object):  # Inherit from object to make it a new-style class\n    def __init__(self, image):\n        self.image = image\n\nclass Eye(Frame):\n    def __init__(self, image):\n        # Call the parent class's __init__ method with the image parameter\n        super(Eye, self).__init__(image)\n        self.some_other_defined_stuff()\n\n    def some_other_defined_stuff(self):\n        # Implement the additional functionality you need here\n        print(\"Executing additional setup for Eye class\")\n```\n\nBy making `Frame` inherit from `object`, both `Frame` and `Eye` become new-style classes, and `super()` can be used without error. Additionally, make sure you pass the `image` parameter to `super(Eye, self).__init__(image)` so that the `Frame` class is initialized properly with the `image` argument."
