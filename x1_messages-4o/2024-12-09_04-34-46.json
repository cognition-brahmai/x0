I wish to change this behavior. Here is my DataFrame and the code I have used to export it:\n\nDataFrame:\n\n```python\ndf = pandas.DataFrame(columns=['a','b','c','d'], index=['x','y','z'], dtype=int)\nx = pandas.Series([10,10,10], index=['a','b','d'], dtype=int)\ny = pandas.Series([1,5,2,3], index=['a','b','c','d'], dtype=int)\nz = pandas.Series([1,2,3,4], index=['a','b','c','d'], dtype=int)\ndf.loc['x']=x; df.loc['y']=y; df.loc['z']=z\nprint(df)\n```\n\nExport command:\n\n```python\ndf.to_csv('test.csv', sep='\\t', na_rep='0', dtype=int)\nfor l in open('test.csv'): print l.strip('\\n')\n```\n\nThe output CSV file has some integer values represented with an extra dot zero (e.g., '10.0' instead of '10'). What is causing this and how can I fix it?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with the DataFrame being exported to a CSV file with float representations (e.g., '10.0' instead of '10') is likely due to the way the DataFrame is initialized and manipulated before export. Let's address this step by step:\n\n1. **Data Initialization**: When you create the DataFrame using `pandas.DataFrame` with `dtype=int`, it should ideally ensure that all values are integers. However, the subsequent assignment of rows with Series objects might be implicitly converting them to floats, especially if there are any missing values (NaNs) involved during the assignment.\n\n2. **Export with `to_csv`**: The `to_csv` method doesn't have a `dtype` parameter. Instead, the data type of the exported values is determined by the data type of the DataFrame at the time of export.\n\nTo ensure that the values are exported as integers, you can explicitly convert the DataFrame to integers before exporting it. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Creating the DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(columns=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], index=['x', 'y', 'z'], dtype=int)\nx = pd.Series([10, 10, 10], index=['a', 'b', 'd'], dtype=int)\ny = pd.Series([1, 5, 2, 3], index=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], dtype=int)\nz = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4], index=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], dtype=int)\ndf.loc['x'] = x\ndf.loc['y'] = y\ndf.loc['z'] = z\n\n# Convert the entire DataFrame to integers\ndf = df.fillna(0).astype(int)\n\n# Exporting to CSV\ndf.to_csv('test.csv', sep='\\t', na_rep='0')\n\n# Displaying the contents of the CSV file\nwith open('test.csv') as file:\n    for line in file:\n        print(line.strip('\\n'))\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- **`fillna(0)`**: This ensures that any NaN values are replaced with zeros before conversion, preventing float representation due to NaNs.\n- **`astype(int)`**: This explicitly converts all columns to integers, ensuring that no float types remain in the DataFrame.\n\nBy ensuring that the DataFrame is entirely composed of integers before exporting, you should see the values in the CSV file as integer values without the '.0' decimal point."
