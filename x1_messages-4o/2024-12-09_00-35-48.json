The 'id' is an auto increment field while 'a' and 'b' are character fields with maximum lengths of 10 and 7 respectively. I am currently using Django's default admin to create/edit objects of this model. How can I set it up such that the field 'b' is not editable from the admin, and instead, each new object of this model is automatically assigned a default value of '0000000' for this field?\n\n<pre><code>class SomeModel(models.Model):\n    id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)\n    a = models.CharField(max_length=10)\n    b = models.CharField(max_length=7)\n</code></pre>"

        "content": "To achieve the desired functionality in your Django admin interface, you need to modify both your Django model and the admin configuration. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Step 1: Update the Model\n\nFirst, you need to set a default value for the `b` field in the model definition and make sure it's not editable through the admin interface.\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass SomeModel(models.Model):\n    id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)\n    a = models.CharField(max_length=10)\n    b = models.CharField(max_length=7, default='0000000', editable=False)\n```\n\n### Step 2: Customize the Admin Interface\n\nNext, you need to customize the admin interface to make sure the `b` field is not shown in the form for creating/editing objects.\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom .models import SomeModel\n\nclass SomeModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    # Specify the fields to display in the admin form\n    fields = ('a',)  # Only include field 'a', excluding 'b'\n\n    # To display 'b' in the list view if needed\n    list_display = ('id', 'a', 'b')\n\nadmin.site.register(SomeModel, SomeModelAdmin)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Model Changes**: \n  - Set `default='0000000'` for the `b` field to ensure new objects have this default value.\n  - Set `editable=False` on the `b` field to prevent it from being editable in admin forms.\n\n- **Admin Changes**:\n  - Use the `fields` attribute in the `SomeModelAdmin` class to specify which fields should be included in the form for creating/editing objects. By excluding `b`, you ensure it won't appear as an editable field.\n  - Include `b` in the `list_display` if you want to show its value in the list view of the admin interface.\n\nWith these changes, every new instance of `SomeModel` will automatically have `b` set to `'0000000'`, and this field will not be editable through the Django admin interface."
