I found a solution on the Postgresql wiki that uses psycopg2 and psycopg2.extras, but it is returning a list instead of a dictionary. Here is the code I used:\n\n```python\nimport psycopg2\nimport psycopg2.extras\nconn = psycopg2.connect(\"dbname=mydb host=localhost user=user password=password\")\ncur = conn.cursor(cursor_factory=psycopg2.extras.DictCursor)\ncur.execute (\"select * from port\")\ntype(cur.fetchall())\n```\n\nWhen I print the type of the result, it shows `<type 'list'>` instead of a dictionary. \n\nI tried accessing the first item from the list with `cur.fetchall()[0]` and print the item and its type. Here is the code I used:\n\n```python\nans = cur.fetchall()[0]\nprint ans\nprint type(ans)\n```\n\nThis is the result I received: \n\n```python\n[288, 'T', 51, 1, 1, '192.168.39.188']\n<type 'list'>\n```\n\nCan you help me understand why it is returning a list and how can I get a dictionary instead?"

        "content": "The confusion here stems from the difference between the container type (`list`) and the individual row representation (`DictRow` from `psycopg2.extras.DictCursor`). When you use `psycopg2.extras.DictCursor`, each row fetched from the database is represented as a dictionary-like object (`DictRow`), where columns can be accessed by their names. However, `cur.fetchall()` returns a list of these row objects.\n\nHere's how you can work with the `DictCursor` to access your data as dictionaries:\n\n1. **Fetching All Rows:**\n\n   When you call `cur.fetchall()`, it returns a list of rows. Each row is a `DictRow`, which acts like a dictionary. You can iterate over this list to access each row.\n\n   ```python\n   import psycopg2\n   import psycopg2.extras\n\n   conn = psycopg2.connect(\"dbname=mydb host=localhost user=user password=password\")\n   cur = conn.cursor(cursor_factory=psycopg2.extras.DictCursor)\n   \n   cur.execute(\"SELECT * FROM port\")\n   rows = cur.fetchall()\n\n   for row in rows:\n       print(dict(row))  # Convert DictRow to a regular dictionary if needed\n       # You can access each column by name, e.g., row['column_name']\n   ```\n\n2. **Fetching a Single Row:**\n\n   If you're only interested in retrieving a single row as a dictionary, you can use `cur.fetchone()`:\n\n   ```python\n   import psycopg2\n   import psycopg2.extras\n\n   conn = psycopg2.connect(\"dbname=mydb host=localhost user=user password=password\")\n   cur = conn.cursor(cursor_factory=psycopg2.extras.DictCursor)\n   \n   cur.execute(\"SELECT * FROM port LIMIT 1\")\n   row = cur.fetchone()\n\n   if row:\n       print(dict(row))  # Convert DictRow to a regular dictionary if needed\n       # Access columns by name, e.g., row['column_name']\n   ```\n\nRemember, `DictCursor` is particularly useful when you want to access columns by name rather than by index. However, the overall structure of the data fetched (list of rows) remains the same."
