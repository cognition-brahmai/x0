For instance, if I had 7 oranges and 4 plates, I want my program to return [2, 2, 2, 1] which represents 2 oranges on each of the first three plates and 1 on the fourth plate. Similarly, if I had 10 oranges and 4 plates, the output should be [3, 3, 2, 2]. Could someone guide me on how to implement this?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this by using a simple algorithm to distribute the items evenly across the containers. The idea is to first determine how many items each container can have by dividing the total number of items by the number of containers, and then distribute the remainder among the first few containers. Here's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef distribute_items(items, containers):\n    # Calculate the base number of items per container\n    base = items // containers\n    # Calculate the remainder which needs to be distributed\n    remainder = items % containers\n    \n    # Create a list with the base number of items in each container\n    distribution = [base] * containers\n    \n    # Distribute the remainder among the first few containers\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        distribution[i] += 1\n    \n    return distribution\n\n# Examples\noranges1 = 7\nplates1 = 4\nresult1 = distribute_items(oranges1, plates1)\nprint(result1)  # Output: [2, 2, 2, 1]\n\noranges2 = 10\nplates2 = 4\nresult2 = distribute_items(oranges2, plates2)\nprint(result2)  # Output: [3, 3, 2, 2]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Base Distribution**: Compute the base number of items each container should have by performing integer division of the total items by the number of containers (`items // containers`).\n2. **Remainder Handling**: Calculate the remainder of items that need to be distributed (`items % containers`).\n3. **Create Distribution List**: Start with a list where each container has the base number of items.\n4. **Distribute Remainder**: Distribute the remainder across the first few containers to ensure the distribution is as even as possible.\n\nThis solution ensures that the distribution is as balanced as possible across all containers."
