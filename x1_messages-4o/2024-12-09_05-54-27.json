        "content": "Are the __init__ functions of Mixin classes not automatically called? I'm trying to add some initialization functionality to my child classes that inherit from different API base classes using a Mixin. However, it seems the __init__ function of the Mixin class is not automatically invoked unless I explicitly call it in the Child class's __init__ function. Is there a way to have an init function in a Mixin get called without writing every child class to explicitly invoke the Mixin's init function?\n\nHere is a simple test case I've built:\n\n```python\nclass APIBaseClassOne(object):\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        print (\" base \")\n\nclass SomeMixin(object):\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        print (\" mixin before \")\n        super(SomeMixin, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n        print (\" mixin after \")\n\nclass MyClass(APIBaseClassOne):\n    pass\n\nclass MixedClass(MyClass, SomeMixin):\n    pass\n```\n\nWhen I run the following commands:\n\n```python\n>>> import test\n>>> test.MixedClass()\n base\n<test.MixedClass object at 0x1004cc850>\n```\n\nThe output shows that the Mixin function's init never gets called. I'd like to avoid having to do something like this in every class:\n\n```python\nclass MixedClass(MyClass, SomeMixin):\n    def __init__(*args, **kwargs):\n        SomeMixin.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)\n        MyClass.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs) \n```\n\nNote: All my child classes are inheriting from different base classes with common functionality."

        "content": "In Python, the order of class inheritance affects how constructors (`__init__` methods) are called. In your example, `MixedClass` inherits from `MyClass` and `SomeMixin`, and the method resolution order (MRO) determines which `__init__` method gets called. The MRO for `MixedClass` is `[MixedClass, MyClass, SomeMixin, APIBaseClassOne, object]`. When you create an instance of `MixedClass`, the `__init__` method of `MyClass` is called, and since `MyClass` doesn't define its own `__init__`, it inherits the `__init__` from `APIBaseClassOne`.\n\nTo ensure that the `__init__` methods of all mixins and base classes are called, you can adjust the class hierarchy and use `super()` consistently. Here's a modified version of your code that ensures all `__init__` methods are called:\n\n```python\nclass APIBaseClassOne(object):\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        print(\"base\")\n        super(APIBaseClassOne, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n\nclass SomeMixin(object):\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        print(\"mixin before\")\n        super(SomeMixin, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n        print(\"mixin after\")\n\nclass MyClass(APIBaseClassOne):\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        print(\"MyClass init\")\n        super(MyClass, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n\nclass MixedClass(SomeMixin, MyClass):\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        print(\"MixedClass init\")\n        super(MixedClass, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n\n# Testing\nmixed_instance = MixedClass()\n```\n\nIn this revised example, note the following:\n\n1. The order of inheritance for `MixedClass` is changed to `(SomeMixin, MyClass)` to ensure `SomeMixin`'s `__init__` is in the MRO path before `MyClass`.\n\n2. Each class defines its own `__init__` method and calls `super()` to ensure the next class in the MRO is initialized.\n\n3. The `super()` function is used to call the next class's `__init__` method rather than calling it directly. This is important for maintaining a consistent initialization order, especially in complex class hierarchies.\n\nBy following this pattern, you can ensure that all `__init__` methods in the MRO are executed, including those in mixin classes."
