How can I modify this graph to have the Y-Axis start at the maximum value and go up to 0? The code I used to generate the scatter plot is as below:\n\n```python\npoints = [(10,5), (5,11), (24,13), (7,8)]    \nx_arr = []\ny_arr = []\nfor x,y in points:\n    x_arr.append(x)\n    y_arr.append(y)\nplt.scatter(x_arr,y_arr)\n```"

        "content": "To modify the Y-axis of your scatter plot to start at the maximum value and go down to 0, you can invert the Y-axis using Matplotlib's `invert_yaxis()` function. Here's how you can update your code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\npoints = [(10, 5), (5, 11), (24, 13), (7, 8)]\nx_arr = []\ny_arr = []\n\nfor x, y in points:\n    x_arr.append(x)\n    y_arr.append(y)\n\nplt.scatter(x_arr, y_arr)\n\n# Invert the Y-axis\nplt.gca().invert_yaxis()\n\nplt.xlabel('X-Axis')\nplt.ylabel('Y-Axis')\nplt.title('Scatter Plot with Inverted Y-Axis')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis code will plot the scatter plot with the Y-axis inverted, starting from the maximum Y-value and going down to 0."
