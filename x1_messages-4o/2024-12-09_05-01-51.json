        "content": "Yes, you can stream a large file directly to disk using Python's `requests` library without loading the entire file into memory. This is especially useful for handling large files like movies or datasets. You can achieve this by using the `stream=True` parameter in the `requests.get` call and then iterating over the response in chunks.\n\nHere's an example of how you can do this:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef download_file(url, local_filename):\n    # Send a GET request to the URL with stream=True\n    with requests.get(url, stream=True) as response:\n        response.raise_for_status()  # Check for HTTP errors\n        # Open a file to write the streamed content into\n        with open(local_filename, 'wb') as file:\n            # Iterate over the response data in chunks\n            for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=8192):\n                if chunk:  # Filter out keep-alive new chunks\n                    file.write(chunk)  # Write each chunk to the file\n\n# Example usage\nurl = 'http://example.com/largefile'\nlocal_filename = 'largefile.mp4'\ndownload_file(url, local_filename)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`stream=True`:** This parameter ensures that the content is not immediately downloaded, which allows you to iterate over it in chunks.\n- **`response.iter_content(chunk_size=8192)`:** This method lets you specify the size of the chunks that you want to download. A chunk size of 8192 bytes (8 KB) is commonly used, but you can adjust this size based on your needs.\n- **`file.write(chunk)`:** Each chunk is written to the file as it is received, thereby preventing large files from consuming too much memory.\n\nBy using this approach, you can efficiently download large files without overloading your system's memory."
