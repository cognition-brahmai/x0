Your table should now be sorted in descending order based on the \"Revenue\" column.\n\nFor the Swift code to sort an array of integers in descending order, you can use the `sorted(by:)` method. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```swift\nvar numbers = [7, 2, 9, 4, 1, 6, 3, 8, 5]\n\n// Sort the array in descending order\nlet sortedNumbers = numbers.sorted(by: >)\n\nprint(sortedNumbers)  // Output: [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n```\n\nThis code uses the `sorted(by:)` method with the greater-than operator (`>`) to sort the array in descending order."
