I have used the following Python code using urllib/urllib2 libraries to send a POST request to the server where I'll be storing the data:\n\n```python\ndata = urllib.urlencode({'q': 'Status'})\nu = urllib2.urlopen('http://myserver/inout-tracker', data)\nfor line in u.readlines():\n  print line\n```\n\nOn the server-side, I have the following code:\n\n```php\nif (!isset($_POST['q'])) { die ('No action specified'); }\necho $_POST['q'];\n```\n\nHowever, every time I run my Python application, I get the 'No action specified' text printed to my console, indicating that no POST request has been made. The Python urllib2 library documentation suggests that it should send a POST request when I provide the data parameter. Can anyone help me understand why I don't get a POST request with this code?\n\nI have tried the following code using httplib library and it works fine:\n\n```python\ndata = urllib.urlencode({'q': 'Status'})\nh = httplib.HTTPConnection('myserver:8080')\nheaders = {\"Content-type\": \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\", \n           \"Accept\": \"text/plain\"}\nh.request('POST', '/inout-tracker/index.php', data, headers)\nr = h.getresponse()\nprint r.read()\n```"

        "content": "It looks like you're encountering an issue with the way the POST request is being sent using `urllib2`. Let\u2019s look into a few potential problems and solutions:\n\n1. **Server URL and Port**: Make sure that the URL in both your `urllib2` and `httplib` examples is consistent. In your `httplib` example, you are specifying a port (`8080`), but it's not clear from the `urllib2` example whether you are doing the same. Ensure that the server URL in the `urllib2` example includes the correct port if needed, such as `http://myserver:8080/inout-tracker`.\n\n2. **Python 2 vs Python 3**: The code you're using is for Python 2. If you're using Python 3, the libraries and methods are slightly different. In Python 3, use `urllib.parse` and `urllib.request` instead.\n\n3. **URL Encoding**: Confirm that the URL encoding process is correct and that the server can interpret the data correctly. From your description, it seems fine, but double-check that the server is set up to receive and process the encoded data.\n\n4. **Debugging the Request**: Sometimes, it's helpful to debug what exactly is being sent to the server. You can use a tool like Wireshark or log the request on the server side to see if the data is arriving as expected.\n\n5. **Headers**: Although `urllib2.urlopen()` automatically sets headers for a POST request when given a data parameter, you might want to explicitly set headers to ensure the correct content type. \n\nHere's a modified version of your `urllib2` code with explicit headers:\n\n```python\nimport urllib\nimport urllib2\n\nurl = 'http://myserver:8080/inout-tracker'  # Ensure the port is included if necessary\ndata = urllib.urlencode({'q': 'Status'})\nheaders = {'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}\n\nrequest = urllib2.Request(url, data, headers)\nu = urllib2.urlopen(request)\n\nfor line in u.readlines():\n    print(line)\n```\n\n6. **Server-side Debugging**: Add logging or print statements on the server side to ensure that it is actually receiving the request and the contents of the `$_POST` array.\n\nBy taking these steps, you should be able to diagnose where the issue lies and ensure that the POST request is correctly received by the server."
