        "content": "Yes, you can pad a numpy tensor with zeros along specific axes using the `numpy.pad` function. To pad only the last two axes of a tensor, you can specify the padding width for each axis as a tuple. For your tensor `r` with shape `(4, 3, 2)`, if you want to pad the last two axes, you can do it as follows:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Assuming r is your tensor with shape (4, 3, 2)\nr_padded = np.pad(r, ((0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 1)), mode='constant', constant_values=0)\n```\n\nIn this code, `((0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 1))` specifies the number of zeros to add before and after each dimension. The first tuple `(0, 0)` means no padding for the first axis, while `(1, 1)` means adding one zero before and after the second and third axes. The `mode='constant'` and `constant_values=0` ensure that the padding is done with zeros."
