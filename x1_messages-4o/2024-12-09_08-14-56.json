When I open Anaconda prompt, I can switch from 'root' to '2env' by typing: `activate 2env`. However, I also have conda in my PowerShell, but when I attempt to run `conda activate 2env` in it, I encounter the following error: `CommandNotFoundError: 'activate'`. What could be the possible solution for this issue?"

        "content": "To activate a different Anaconda environment in PowerShell, you need to ensure that your PowerShell is set up correctly to recognize and execute `conda` commands. Here\u2019s how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Initialize Conda for PowerShell**: The first step is to ensure that Conda is set up to work with PowerShell. You can do this by running the following command in an Anaconda Prompt (not in PowerShell):\n\n   ```bash\n   conda init powershell\n   ```\n\n   This command configures your PowerShell profile to recognize the `conda` commands.\n\n2. **Restart PowerShell**: After running the initialization command, close and reopen your PowerShell window. This ensures that the changes take effect.\n\n3. **Activate the Environment**: Now, you should be able to activate your environment using the `conda activate` command in PowerShell:\n\n   ```powershell\n   conda activate 2env\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify Conda Installation Path**: Make sure that the path to the `conda` executable is in your system's PATH environment variable. If `conda init powershell` did not configure this automatically, you might need to add the path manually.\n\n5. **Check for Errors**: If you encounter any errors during the initialization step, ensure that your Anaconda installation is complete and that PowerShell is being run with administrative privileges if required.\n\n6. **PowerShell Execution Policy**: Sometimes, PowerShell's execution policy might prevent scripts from running. You can temporarily change this setting by running the following command in PowerShell with administrative privileges:\n\n   ```powershell\n   Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned\n   ```\n\n   Remember to reset this to its original state if needed for security purposes after you have finished setting up.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to activate and switch between Conda environments in PowerShell without encountering the `CommandNotFoundError`."
