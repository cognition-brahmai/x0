        "content": "The error message you're encountering indicates that Python is not properly installed or recognized in your system's PATH. Here's how you can resolve the issue and proceed with installing your GUI:\n\n1. **Verify Python Installation:**\n   - Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Add Python to PATH:**\n   - During the installation process, make sure to check the box that says \"Add Python to PATH.\" This will allow you to run Python and its associated commands from the terminal.\n\n3. **Check Python Installation:**\n   - After installation, open a new terminal or command prompt and type `python --version` or `python3 --version` to verify that Python is installed correctly.\n\n4. **Install pip:**\n   - If pip is not installed, you can install it by downloading `get-pip.py` from https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py and running `python get-pip.py`.\n\n5. **Install Virtualenv (Optional):**\n   - If you want to use a virtual environment for your project, you can install `virtualenv` using the command:\n     ```bash\n     python -m pip install --upgrade virtualenv\n     ```\n\n6. **Install GUI Libraries:**\n   - Depending on the GUI framework you're using, you might need to install specific libraries. For example, if you're using Tkinter (which is included with Python), you don't need to install anything extra. For other libraries like PyQt or Kivy, you can use pip to install them:\n     ```bash\n     python -m pip install pyqt5\n     ```\n     or\n     ```bash\n     python -m pip install kivy\n     ```\n\n7. **Resolve Execution Aliases:**\n   - If you're still having issues, go to `Settings > Apps > Apps & features`, search for \"App execution aliases,\" and disable any Python-related aliases that might be causing conflicts.\n\nAfter completing these steps, you should be able to run Python commands and install the necessary packages for your GUI application. If you encounter further issues, please let me know!"
