Here's the R code to compute the median of a dataset with the given list of numbers and to calculate the standard error of the computed median value:\n\n```r\n# Define the data\ndata <- c(5, 4, 7, 2, 8)\n\n# Compute the median\nmedian_value <- median(data)\nprint(paste(\"Median:\", median_value))\n\n# Calculate the standard error of the median\n# Note: Standard error of the median is not commonly calculated in the same way as mean\n# A simple approximation can be done using the standard deviation and number of observations\nstandard_error <- sd(data) / sqrt(length(data))\nprint(paste(\"Standard Error Approximation:\", standard_error))\n```\n\nThis code first calculates the median of the provided data set and then computes an approximation of the standard error using the standard deviation and the square root of the number of observations in the dataset. Note that the standard error for the median is not typically calculated in the same manner as the standard error for the mean, but this provides a simple approximation."
