I have code that compiles with a higher compute capability and runs flawlessly on a device with lower compute capability for quite a while, but then abruptly fails in some kernel. I discovered that the Build Rule was set to 'sm_21' while my device (Tesla C2050) was a '2.0'. Is there any CUDA API code that I can include to auto-check if it's running on a device with compatible compute capability? I need to compile and work with devices of varying compute capabilities. Is there any other steps I can take to avoid such errors?"

        "content": "To ensure that your CUDA code runs properly across devices with varying compute capabilities, you can programmatically check the compute capability of the device using the CUDA Runtime API. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Query Device Properties**: Use the `cudaGetDeviceProperties()` function to obtain the properties of the currently active device. This will include the compute capability, which is specified by `major` and `minor` version numbers.\n\n2. **Check Compatibility**: In your code, you can compare these version numbers against the compute capability your code is compiled for, and handle any mismatches appropriately (e.g., by notifying the user, or by choosing an alternative code path).\n\nHere's a sample code snippet that demonstrates how to query and check the compute capability:\n\n```c\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nvoid checkComputeCapability() {\n    int device;\n    cudaError_t err = cudaGetDevice(&device);\n    if (err != cudaSuccess) {\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Failed to get CUDA device: %s\\n\", cudaGetErrorString(err));\n        return;\n    }\n\n    cudaDeviceProp deviceProp;\n    err = cudaGetDeviceProperties(&deviceProp, device);\n    if (err != cudaSuccess) {\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Failed to get device properties: %s\\n\", cudaGetErrorString(err));\n        return;\n    }\n\n    printf(\"Device %d: %s\\n\", device, deviceProp.name);\n    printf(\"Compute Capability: %d.%d\\n\", deviceProp.major, deviceProp.minor);\n\n    // Example: Check against a specific required compute capability\n    int requiredMajor = 2;\n    int requiredMinor = 0;\n    if (deviceProp.major > requiredMajor || \n        (deviceProp.major == requiredMajor && deviceProp.minor >= requiredMinor)) {\n        printf(\"Device meets the required compute capability.\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"Device does not meet the required compute capability.\\n\");\n        // Take appropriate action, like exiting or setting a fallback option\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    checkComputeCapability();\n    // Your CUDA code here\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Additional Steps to Avoid Errors:\n\n1. **Compile for Multiple Architectures**: When compiling your CUDA code, specify multiple architectures with `-gencode` flags. This allows the binary to support multiple compute capability versions. For example:\n\n   ```\n   nvcc -gencode arch=compute_20,code=sm_20 -gencode arch=compute_30,code=sm_30 ...\n   ```\n\n2. **Use Runtime Compilation**: Use NVIDIA's CUDA Dynamic Parallelism, or JIT (Just In Time) compilation features in CUDA to compile kernels at runtime based on the detected device compute capability.\n\n3. **Test on Different Devices**: Ensure you test your application on various devices with different compute capabilities to catch potential issues early.\n\n4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implement fallback mechanisms within your code to handle cases where specific features are not supported on older devices.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure your application is robust across different GPU architectures and compute capabilities."
