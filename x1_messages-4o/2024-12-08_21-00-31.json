Additionally, the statement should account for the impact of the humidity level in the air on the occurrence of the aforementioned event or action. Please express your answer in a concise and precise manner, taking into account any relevant contextual factors and assumptions."

However, this is contingent on the humidity level being within a comfortable range (between 30% and 60%). High humidity (above 60%) may lead to discomfort and potential health risks, while low humidity (below 30%) could cause dehydration, thus affecting the decision to proceed with the event."
