Here are a few methods to achieve this:\n\n1. **String Concatenation:**\n\n   You can concatenate strings and variables using the `+` operator:\n\n   ```python\n   value = 42\n   print('Value is \"' + str(value) + '\"')\n   ```\n\n2. **Formatted String Literals (f-strings):** \n\n   If you're using Python 3.6 or later, you can use f-strings for a more readable approach:\n\n   ```python\n   value = 42\n   print(f'Value is \"{value}\"')\n   ```\n\n3. **String Formatting with `format()` method:**\n\n   You can also use the `format()` method to achieve this:\n\n   ```python\n   value = 42\n   print('Value is \"{}\"'.format(value))\n   ```\n\nEach of these methods will print `Value is \"42\"` without any spaces around the value."
