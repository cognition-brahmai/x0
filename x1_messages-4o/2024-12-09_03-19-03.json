Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n1. Use `basename` to extract the filename from the path.\n2. Then, use parameter expansion to remove the extension from the filename.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```bash\nsource_file=\"/path/to/your/file.txt\"\n\n# Step 1: Extract the filename with path stripped\nfilename_with_ext=$(basename \"$source_file\")\n\n# Step 2: Remove the extension\nfilename_no_ext=\"${filename_with_ext%.*}\"\n\necho \"Filename without extension: $filename_no_ext\"\n```\n\nIn this script:\n- `basename \"$source_file\"` extracts `file.txt` from `/path/to/your/file.txt`.\n- `${filename_with_ext%.*}` removes the extension, resulting in `file`.\n\nThis will give you just the filename without the extension or the path."
