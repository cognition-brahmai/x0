I tried using a paginator to get a complete set of data by setting the \"MaxItems\" to 1000. However, if I set \"MaxItems\" to 10, how can I loop through the results effectively? I attempted a solution but it only loops 2 iterations before 'IsTruncated' equals False, resulting in a \"KeyError: 'Marker'\". I'm not sure why this is happening because I know there are over 200 results. Here's the code I used:\n\n```\nmarker = None\n\nwhile True:\n    paginator = client.get_paginator('list_users')\n    response_iterator = paginator.paginate( \n        PaginationConfig={\n            'MaxItems': 10,\n            'StartingToken': marker})\n    #print(response_iterator)\n    for page in response_iterator:\n        u = page['Users']\n        for user in u:\n            print(user['UserName'])\n            print(page['IsTruncated'])\n            marker = page['Marker']\n            print(marker)\n        else:\n            break\n```"

        "content": "It seems like you're using a paginator incorrectly, which is causing the `KeyError: 'Marker'`. The `Marker` key is only present in the response if `IsTruncated` is `True`, which indicates that there are more results available. If `IsTruncated` is `False`, there won't be a `Marker` in the response, leading to the error you're seeing.\n\nHere's how you can effectively loop through all the results using a paginator:\n\n1. You should only update the `marker` if `IsTruncated` is `True`.\n2. The `for` loop should not break prematurely. Instead, it should continue until all pages are retrieved.\n\nHere's a revised version of your code:\n\n```python\nmarker = None\nclient = boto3.client('iam')\n\nwhile True:\n    paginator = client.get_paginator('list_users')\n    response_iterator = paginator.paginate(\n        PaginationConfig={\n            'MaxItems': 10,\n            'StartingToken': marker\n        }\n    )\n\n    for page in response_iterator:\n        users = page.get('Users', [])\n        for user in users:\n            print(user['UserName'])\n\n        # Check if there are more pages to retrieve\n        if page.get('IsTruncated'):\n            marker = page.get('Marker')\n        else:\n            # No more pages left\n            marker = None\n            break\n\n    if marker is None:\n        break\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- **Check `IsTruncated`**: Only update the `marker` if `IsTruncated` is `True`.\n- **Use `.get()` method**: Use the `.get()` method when accessing dictionary keys to avoid `KeyError`.\n- **Remove the `else` block**: It was incorrectly placed inside the loop. Instead, control the loop using the `if marker is None:` condition to break out when no more pages are available.\n\nThis should allow you to paginate through all users correctly."
