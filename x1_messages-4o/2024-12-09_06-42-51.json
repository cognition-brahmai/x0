        "content": "Certainly! To create a Python script that conducts a Google search and prints the links of the top results, you can use the `googlesearch-python` library. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Install the library**: First, you'll need to install the `googlesearch-python` package. You can install it using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install googlesearch-python\n   ```\n\n2. **Create the Python script**: You can create a script that uses this library to perform a Google search and print the URLs of the top results.\n\n   ```python\n   from googlesearch import search\n\n   def google_search(query, num_results=10):\n       # Perform the search\n       search_results = search(query, num=num_results, stop=num_results, pause=2)\n       \n       # Print the links of the top results\n       for i, link in enumerate(search_results, start=1):\n           print(f\"Result {i}: {link}\")\n\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       query = input(\"Enter your search query: \")\n       google_search(query)\n   ```\n\n3. **Run the script**: Save the script to a file, say `google_search.py`, and run it using Python:\n\n   ```bash\n   python google_search.py\n   ```\n\n4. **Enter a search query**: When prompted, enter your search query, and the script will print the links of the top results.\n\nThis script uses the `googlesearch-python` package to perform a Google search. It fetches a specified number of results (`num_results`) and prints their URLs. Note that the `pause` parameter is used to prevent being blocked by Google due to too many requests in a short period.\n\nPlease remember to use this script responsibly and respect Google's terms of service."
