I need to join these three tables into one by running a single query using SQLAlchemy where `user.email = \"user@email.com\"`. I have tried the following code but it doesn't seem to work:\n\n```python\nresult = session.query(User, Document, DocumentPermission).filter_by(email = \"user@email.com\").all()\n```\n\nThe classes are defined as follows:\n\n```python\nclass User(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'users'\n    email = Column(String, primary_key=True)\n    name = Column(String)\n\nclass Document(Base):\n    __tablename__ = \"documents\"\n    name = Column(String, primary_key=True)\n    author = Column(String, ForeignKey(\"users.email\"))\n\nclass DocumentsPermissions(Base):\n    __tablename__ = \"documents_permissions\"\n    readAllowed = Column(Boolean)\n    writeAllowed = Column(Boolean)\n    document = Column(String, ForeignKey(\"documents.name\"))\n```\n\nHow can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To join the `User`, `Document`, and `DocumentsPermissions` tables into a single query using SQLAlchemy, you need to use the `join` method to explicitly specify how these tables are related. Since you want to filter the results where `user.email = \"user@email.com\"`, you should apply the filter on the `User` model.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\n\n# Assuming you have already created an engine\nSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\nsession = Session()\n\n# Query with joins\nresult = (\n    session.query(User, Document, DocumentsPermissions)\n    .join(Document, User.email == Document.author)\n    .join(DocumentsPermissions, Document.name == DocumentsPermissions.document)\n    .filter(User.email == \"user@email.com\")\n    .all()\n)\n\n# Process the result\nfor user, document, permission in result:\n    print(f\"User: {user.name}, Document: {document.name}, Read Allowed: {permission.readAllowed}, Write Allowed: {permission.writeAllowed}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Join Statements**:\n   - `join(Document, User.email == Document.author)` joins the `User` table with the `Document` table on the condition that the `author` column in the `Document` table matches the `email` column in the `User` table.\n   - `join(DocumentsPermissions, Document.name == DocumentsPermissions.document)` joins the `Document` table with the `DocumentsPermissions` table on the condition that the `name` column in the `Document` table matches the `document` column in the `DocumentsPermissions` table.\n\n2. **Filter**:\n   - The `filter(User.email == \"user@email.com\")` applies the condition to filter users with the specified email.\n\n3. **Result Processing**:\n   - The result is a list of tuples, each containing a `User`, `Document`, and `DocumentsPermissions` object. You can iterate through this list and access each attribute as needed.\n\nMake sure your database schema is correctly set up with the necessary foreign key relationships, and that the `engine` is already defined and connected to your database."
