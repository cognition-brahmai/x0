For instance, consider the following DataFrame:\n\n```python\ndata1 data2 data3  \n1     3     3  \n2     NaN   5  \n3     4     NaN  \n```\nI want to obtain the result `['data2', 'data3']`. Currently, I have the following code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nprint('\\n'.join(map(\n    lambda x : str(x[1])\n    ,(filter(lambda z: z[0] != False, zip(train.isnull().any(axis=0), train.columns.values)))\n)))\n```\nAlthough this code works fine, I am wondering if there's a simpler way to accomplish this."

        "content": "Yes, there is a simpler and more readable way to achieve this using Pandas. You can utilize the `.isnull()` method along with the `.any()` method to identify columns with missing values. Here's a more concise way to get the list of column names with missing values:\n\n```python\nmissing_value_columns = train.columns[train.isnull().any()].tolist()\nprint(missing_value_columns)\n```\n\nThis code works as follows:\n- `train.isnull()` returns a DataFrame of the same shape as `train`, where each element is `True` if the corresponding element in `train` is `NaN`, and `False` otherwise.\n- `train.isnull().any()` returns a Series indicating whether each column contains any missing values (`True` if a column has any `NaN` values, `False` otherwise).\n- `train.columns[...]` uses this boolean Series to filter the column names, returning only those with `True` values.\n- `.tolist()` converts the resulting Index object to a Python list.\n\nThis approach is more direct and easier to understand."
