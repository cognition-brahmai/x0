        "content": "In Python 3.x, the `str.replace()` method is not deprecated and can still be used to replace substrings within a string. It works in the same way as it did in earlier versions of Python. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\noriginal_string = \"Hello, world!\"\nnew_string = original_string.replace(\"world\", \"Python\")\nprint(new_string)  # Output: Hello, Python!\n```\n\nThe `replace()` method takes two arguments: the substring you want to replace and the new substring you want to replace it with. Optionally, you can also provide a third argument to specify the maximum number of occurrences to replace.\n\nHere's an example with the optional third argument:\n\n```python\noriginal_string = \"apple apple apple\"\nnew_string = original_string.replace(\"apple\", \"orange\", 2)\nprint(new_string)  # Output: orange orange apple\n```\n\nSo, you can continue to use `str.replace()` in Python 3.x without any issues. If you're facing any specific problem, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to help!"
