Can you provide a comprehensive set of rules covering word selection, player order, and the scoring system?\nIn terms of word selection, players should choose words that are not too easy or too difficult, with a minimum of 4 letters and a maximum of 8 letters. The first player will start with a randomly selected word, and then each subsequent player must come up with a new word that begins with the last letter of the previous word.\nAs for player order, it can be determined randomly or by some other agreed-upon method. Scoring can be based on the length of the word used, with longer words earning more points. Additionally, bonus points can be awarded for using particularly challenging letters, such as Q or Z.\nTo play this game using Shell cmd, players can take turns entering their words into the command line, with the previous player's last letter being used as the starting point for the next word. Points can be tallied manually or using a script to keep track of the score."

Proper nouns, acronyms, and abbreviations are not allowed unless otherwise agreed upon.\n3. **Uniqueness**: Words cannot be repeated within the same game session.\n4. **Difficulty Balance**: Aim for words that are neither too easy nor too difficult. Players can agree on a difficulty level before starting.\n\n### Player Order:\n1. **Random Selection**: Determine the initial player order randomly, such as drawing lots or using a random number generator.\n2. **Turn Rotation**: Proceed in a clockwise or predetermined order from the starting player.\n3. **Method Changes**: Optionally, the order can change after each round to add variability.\n\n### Scoring System:\n1. **Word Length**: Earn 1 point for each letter in the word. For example, a 4-letter word earns 4 points.\n2. **Bonus Points**: \n   - Add 2 bonus points for words starting with challenging letters like Q or Z.\n   - Additional bonuses could be awarded for using rare or complex words, upon mutual agreement.\n3. **Penalties**: Deduct points for invalid or repeated words. For instance, subtract 2 points if a player uses an invalid word.\n\n### Playing Using Shell Command Line:\n1. **Command Line Input**: Each player enters their word into the command line, making sure it starts with the last letter of the previous word.\n2. **Validation Script**: Optionally, use a script to validate word legitimacy, check repetition, and calculate scores automatically.\n3. **Score Tracking**: Maintain a running tally of scores either manually or via script output.\n\n### Additional Rules:\n1. **Time Limit**: Impose a time limit (e.g., 30 seconds) for each player to input their word to keep the game moving and add a challenge.\n2. **Challenges**: Players can challenge a word if they believe it\u2019s invalid. If the challenge is successful, the player using the invalid word receives a penalty.\n3. **Game End**: Decide in advance how many rounds will be played or set a target score. The player with the highest score at the end wins.\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, players can enjoy a fair and engaging game of Word Chain, whether playing casually or competitively."
