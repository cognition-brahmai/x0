        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to memory allocation, and it's likely due to the large size of the dataset you're working with. When converting the sparse matrix to a dense tensor, the memory requirements can become quite significant. To address this issue, here are a few strategies you might consider:\n\n1. **Keep the Data Sparse**: Instead of converting the sparse matrix to a dense tensor, you might want to keep it as a sparse tensor. PyTorch has support for sparse tensors, which can significantly reduce memory usage. You can work with `torch.sparse.FloatTensor` without converting it to a dense format. This approach is useful for operations that are compatible with sparse representations.\n\n    ```python\n    tfidf_matrix_tensor = torch.sparse.FloatTensor(i, v, torch.Size(coo.shape))\n    ```\n\n2. **Chunking**: If you need to perform operations that require a dense representation, consider processing the data in smaller chunks. This involves dividing your data into smaller submatrices, processing each chunk separately, and then aggregating the results.\n\n3. **Memory Management**: Ensure that your system has enough available memory. Check if there are other processes consuming memory and close unnecessary applications. Also, use `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` if you are running out of GPU memory, although this is not a solution for CPU memory errors.\n\n4. **Use a More Memory-Efficient Data Structure**: If you are performing operations that inherently require a dense format, consider using data types that require less memory (e.g., `torch.half` or `torch.float16`), but be mindful of the precision loss.\n\n5. **Optimize the Environment**: Increase your system's swap memory or run the code on a machine with more RAM if possible.\n\n6. **Profile Memory Usage**: Use tools to profile memory usage and identify potential inefficiencies or leaks. Libraries like `memory_profiler` in Python can help you understand which parts of your code consume the most memory.\n\nBy keeping the data sparse or managing memory more effectively through one of these methods, you should be able to avoid the `RuntimeError` and handle your dataset more efficiently."
