Here is an example of what I'm trying to accomplish:\n\n```python\ndef Game(listA, listB, rules):\n   if rules == True:\n      # do something\n   else:\n      # do something else\n\ndef Rule1(v):\n  if \"variable_name1\" in v:\n      return False\n  elif \"variable_name2\" in v:\n      return False\n  else:\n      return True\n\ndef Rule2(v):\n  if \"variable_name3\" and \"variable_name4\" in v:\n      return False\n  elif \"variable_name4\" and variable_name1 in v:\n      return False\n  else:\n      return True\n```\n\nThis is just a pseudo code, but I get the code to compile. I need to know how to call the function `Game` and whether it's correctly defined since rules will be switched for either `Rule1(v)` or `Rule2(v)`."

        "content": "To pass a function into another function in Python, you can simply pass the function name as an argument without parentheses. Here's how you can modify your example to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef Game(listA, listB, rules_func):\n    for item in listA:\n        if rules_func(item):\n            # Do something if the rule returns True\n            print(f\"Rule passed for {item}\")\n        else:\n            # Do something else if the rule returns False\n            print(f\"Rule failed for {item}\")\n\ndef Rule1(v):\n    if \"variable_name1\" in v:\n        return False\n    elif \"variable_name2\" in v:\n        return False\n    else:\n        return True\n\ndef Rule2(v):\n    if \"variable_name3\" in v and \"variable_name4\" in v:\n        return False\n    elif \"variable_name4\" in v and \"variable_name1\" in v:\n        return False\n    else:\n        return True\n\n# Example usage\nlistA = [\"variable_name1\", \"variable_name3\", \"variable_name4\"]\nlistB = [\"variable_name1\", \"variable_name2\"]\n\n# Use Rule1\nprint(\"Using Rule1:\")\nGame(listA, listB, Rule1)\n\n# Use Rule2\nprint(\"\\nUsing Rule2:\")\nGame(listA, listB, Rule2)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Parameter**: In the `Game` function, `rules_func` is a parameter that expects a function. You call it using `rules_func(item)` within the loop.\n\n2. **Function Passing**: When calling `Game`, you pass `Rule1` or `Rule2` without parentheses, which means you're passing the function itself, not the result of calling the function.\n\n3. **Usage**: This allows you to switch between different rule sets by passing different functions to `Game`.\n\nBy adjusting your code this way, you ensure that `Game` can flexibly apply any rule function you provide."
