In 1.6, I used to load initial data with a `fixture/initial_data.json` file, which was loaded with the `python manage.py syncdb` command when creating the database. However, with the introduction of migrations, there is no automatic loading of fixtures and this behavior is considered deprecated. The official documentation does not have a clear example on how to load initial data using data migrations. What is the best way to import such initial data using data migrations? Should I write Python code with multiple calls to `mymodel.create(...)`, or should I use or write a Django function (like calling `loaddata`) to load data from a JSON fixture file? I would prefer to use the second option and I don't want to use South, as Django seems to be able to do it natively now."

        "content": "When transitioning from Django 1.6 to 1.7 and beyond, the approach to loading initial data has indeed changed due to the introduction of migrations. The `initial_data.json` fixture is no longer automatically loaded during database creation. However, you can still manage this process using data migrations or other Django features.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can handle initial data loading with migrations:\n\n### Using Data Migrations\n\n1. **Create a Data Migration**: You can create a data migration to load your initial data. This involves writing a migration script that either inserts data directly or calls a function to load from a fixture.\n\n2. **Writing the Migration**:\n    - First, create a new migration file:\n      ```bash\n      python manage.py makemigrations your_app_name\n      ```\n\n    - Open the newly created migration file in your app's `migrations` directory. You'll define a function that will load your initial data.\n\n3. **Loading Data with `loaddata`**:\n    - You can call the `loaddata` management command within your migration using the `call_command` function.\n    - Modify the migration file to look something like this:\n\n    ```python\n    from django.db import migrations\n    from django.core.management import call_command\n\n    def load_initial_data(apps, schema_editor):\n        # Load the fixture data using `loaddata`\n        call_command('loaddata', 'initial_data.json')\n\n    class Migration(migrations.Migration):\n\n        dependencies = [\n            # Specify any dependencies here\n        ]\n\n        operations = [\n            migrations.RunPython(load_initial_data),\n        ]\n    ```\n\n4. **Ensure the Fixture is Available**:\n    - Make sure the `initial_data.json` file is placed in your app\u2019s `fixtures` directory or any directory specified in the `FIXTURE_DIRS` settings.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Order of Migrations**: Ensure that your data migration is applied after the models are created. This typically means adding it after other relevant migrations in the `dependencies` list.\n- **Error Handling**: Consider adding error handling in your `load_initial_data` function to manage potential issues during data loading.\n- **Scalability**: For large datasets, you might consider optimizing the data loading process to avoid performance bottlenecks.\n\n### Alternative Approach\n\nIf you prefer not to use migrations for this purpose, you could implement a custom management command that loads your initial data and run it manually after applying migrations:\n\n1. **Create a Management Command**:\n    - Create a new command in `your_app_name/management/commands/load_initial_data.py`.\n\n2. **Write the Command**:\n    - In this script, you can use the `loaddata` function similar to the migration script.\n\n3. **Run the Command**:\n    - Execute the custom command with:\n      ```bash\n      python manage.py load_initial_data\n      ```\n\nUsing data migrations makes your initial data loading part of your deployment process, ensuring that data is consistently loaded in different environments. While a custom command provides more flexibility for manual control, it requires an additional step during deployment. Choose the method that best suits your workflow and deployment strategy."
