        "content": "Converting a large set of JavaScript scripts into Python can be a complex task because of the differences in language syntax, paradigms, and libraries. However, there are a few tools and methods that might help you with the basic conversion process:\n\n1. **Transcrypt**: Although primarily a Python to JavaScript transpiler, you might find it useful in understanding the structural differences between the two languages, which could aid in manual conversion.\n\n2. **Js2Py**: This is a JavaScript to Python translator and JavaScript interpreter written in 100% pure Python. It allows you to convert JavaScript code to Python code, although it might require further refinement for complex scripts.\n\n3. **Jiphy**: Jiphy stands for \"JavaScript in Python out\" and is intended for converting code between the two languages. However, it supports only a subset of JavaScript and Python features, so it may not handle complex scripts well.\n\n4. **Manual Conversion**: Often, the best approach is a semi-automated process where you use the tools to convert simpler constructs and patterns and then manually handle the more complex parts. For regex, you might need to manually adapt the syntax since JavaScript and Python have different regex engines.\n\n5. **Custom Scripts**: For a large-scale conversion, you might consider writing custom scripts to handle repetitive conversion tasks. For instance, you could write Python scripts to find and replace common JavaScript patterns with their Python equivalents.\n\n6. **Translation Services**: If the scripts are part of a commercial project and the budget allows, hiring a service specializing in code translation might be an option.\n\n7. **IDE Tools**: Some IDEs like PyCharm and Visual Studio Code might have plugins or extensions that can assist with language-specific refactoring and conversion.\n\nKeep in mind that while these tools and methods can assist with the conversion, the fundamental differences in language features and idioms mean that a significant amount of manual adjustment and testing will likely be necessary to ensure the Python code behaves as expected."
