        "content": "In PyCharm, the message \"Process finished with exit code 0\" is a standard output message indicating that the script executed successfully without any errors. However, if you want to suppress this message and have a cleaner console output, you can try the following approaches:\n\n1. **Run in Terminal**: Instead of running your script in the PyCharm console, you can run it in an external terminal. This way, you will only see the script's output without the additional exit code message. You can configure PyCharm to run the script in an external terminal by going to:\n   - `Run` > `Edit Configurations`.\n   - Select your script configuration.\n   - Under the `Configuration` tab, check the option `Run with Python console`.\n   - Click `OK` and run your script.\n\n2. **Modify the IDE Settings**: As of now, PyCharm does not provide a built-in setting to hide the \"Process finished with exit code\" message directly. However, you can try using a custom script or plugin if available, but this may require additional setup and is not always straightforward.\n\n3. **Script Modification**: If you're looking to minimize extra output for a presentation or demo, you could manually copy and paste the desired output from the console to a text editor to display it cleanly, but this doesn't change the behavior within PyCharm itself.\n\n4. **Consider an IDE Plugin**: Check the JetBrains Plugin Repository for any third-party plugins that might offer a feature to clean up console output. Be cautious with third-party plugins as they might not always be updated or supported.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no direct setting in PyCharm to completely remove the \"Process finished with exit code\" line from the console output. It's generally used as a helpful indicator for debugging and understanding the execution state of your script."
