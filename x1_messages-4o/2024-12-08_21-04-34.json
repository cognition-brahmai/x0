        "content": "Creating a natural and eco-friendly border around your garden can enhance its beauty, provide privacy, and support local wildlife. Here are five specific types of plants that can serve this purpose:\n\n1. **Lavender (Lavandula spp.)**:\n   - **Benefits**: Lavender is not only aesthetically pleasing with its beautiful purple flowers, but it also attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its fragrant aroma can deter some wildlife.\n   - **Maintenance**: Requires well-drained soil and full sun; drought-tolerant once established.\n\n2. **Holly (Ilex spp.)**:\n   - **Benefits**: Known for its glossy, spiky leaves, holly can form a dense, thorny barrier that discourages wildlife. It also produces berries that can attract birds.\n   - **Maintenance**: Prefers well-drained soil and can tolerate partial to full sun.\n\n3. **Boxwood (Buxus spp.)**:\n   - **Benefits**: Boxwood provides a classic, dense hedge that offers privacy and can be shaped as desired. While it doesn\u2019t attract pollinators, it serves as a structural element in the garden.\n   - **Maintenance**: Requires regular pruning to maintain shape; tolerant of a range of sunlight conditions.\n\n4. **Butterfly Bush (Buddleja spp.)**:\n   - **Benefits**: Named for its ability to attract butterflies, this plant offers vibrant flowers that also attract bees and hummingbirds. It can grow tall, providing privacy.\n   - **Maintenance**: Prefers full sun and well-drained soil; prune to encourage bushy growth.\n\n5. **Rugosa Rose (Rosa rugosa)**:\n   - **Benefits**: This hardy rose species produces fragrant flowers and hips that attract pollinators and birds. Its thorny stems can deter larger wildlife.\n   - **Maintenance**: Thrives in sandy, well-drained soil and full sun; relatively disease-resistant and low-maintenance for a rose.\n\nThese plants not only provide functional benefits but also contribute to the ecological health of your garden by supporting pollinators and other wildlife."
