However, when I pass my text as an argument, the result is in the form of individual letters rather than whole words, like so: [' ', 'e', 'a', 'o', 'n', 'i', 't', 'r', 's', 'l', 'd', 'h', 'c', 'y', 'b', 'u', 'g', '\\n', 'm', 'p', 'w', 'f', ',', 'v', '.', \"'\", 'k', 'B', '\"', 'M', 'H', '9', 'C', '-', 'N', 'S', '1', 'A', 'G', 'P', 'T', 'W', '[', ']', '(', ')', '0', '7', 'E', 'J', 'O', 'R', 'j', 'x']. According to the NLTK website, the result should be in whole words. Here's the code I'm using:\n\n```\nfile_y = open(fileurl)\np = file_y.read()\nfdist = FreqDist(p)\nvocab = fdist.keys()\nvocab[:100]\n```\n\nCan anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that you're passing the entire string `p` directly to `FreqDist`, which processes it as a sequence of characters rather than as a sequence of words. To get the frequency distribution of words, you need to tokenize the text into words before passing it to `FreqDist`. Here's how you can do it using NLTK's `word_tokenize` function:\n\n```python\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk import FreqDist\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\n\n# Make sure NLTK's punkt tokenizer is available\nnltk.download('punkt')\n\n# Open and read the file\nfile_y = open(fileurl)\np = file_y.read()\n\n# Tokenize the text into words\nwords = word_tokenize(p)\n\n# Create a frequency distribution of the words\nfdist = FreqDist(words)\n\n# Get the vocabulary and print the first 100 words\nvocab = list(fdist.keys())\nprint(vocab[:100])\n\n# Don't forget to close the file\nfile_y.close()\n```\n\nThis code uses `word_tokenize` to split the text into words, which is what `FreqDist` expects to create a frequency distribution of words rather than characters. Make sure to download the 'punkt' package if you haven't already, as it's required for tokenization."
