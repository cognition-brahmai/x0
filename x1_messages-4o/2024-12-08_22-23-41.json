        "content": "Your provided Swift function effectively repeats a word a specified number of times and appends a given phrase at the end. Here's a breakdown of how the function works:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `repeatWord` takes three parameters: `word` (the word to be repeated), `count` (the number of times the word should be repeated), and `endPhrase` (the phrase to append at the end).\n\n2. **Variable Initialization**: A variable `result` is initialized as an empty string. This will be used to build the final output string.\n\n3. **Loop for Repetition**: A `for` loop runs from `0` to `count-1`. Inside the loop:\n   - The `word` is added to the `result`.\n   - If the current index `i` is not the last one (`i != count-1`), a space is added after the `word` to separate it from the next occurrence.\n\n4. **Appending the End Phrase**: After the loop completes, the `endPhrase` is appended to the `result` with a leading space to separate it from the last repeated word.\n\n5. **Return Statement**: The function returns the constructed `result` string.\n\nHere's how you can use it in a program:\n\n```swift\nfunc repeatWord(word: String, count: Int, endPhrase: String) -> String {\n    var result = \"\"\n    for i in 0..<count {\n        result += word\n        if i != count-1 {\n            result += \" \"\n        }\n    }\n    result += \" \" + endPhrase\n    return result\n}\n\nlet sentence = repeatWord(word: \"ran\", count: 5, endPhrase: \"until he could run no more\")\nprint(sentence)  // Outputs: \"ran ran ran ran ran until he could run no more\"\n```\n\nThis function is efficient for small tasks. However, for more extensive tasks or more complex sentence constructions, you might consider using Swift's `joined(separator:)` method on collections or other string manipulation techniques for better performance and readability."
