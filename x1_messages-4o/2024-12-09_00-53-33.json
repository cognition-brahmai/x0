However, the third-party readline packages I have come across only support up to Python 2.6. Is there a third-party readline package available that is compatible with Python 2.7 on Windows?"

This package is specifically designed for Windows and should work well with Python 2.7.\n\nTo install `pyreadline`, you can use `pip`, the Python package manager. Open your command prompt and run the following command:\n\n```bash\npip install pyreadline\n```\n\nOnce installed, you can import and use it in your Python 2.7 program like this:\n\n```python\nimport readline\n\n# Your code using readline functionality\n```\n\n`pyreadline` should provide you with similar functionality to what GNU readline offers on Unix-like systems."
