I have a DataFrame like this:\n\n```python\n   col1 col2 col3\n1   0.2  0.3  0.3\n2   0.2  0.3  0.3\n3     0  0.4  0.4\n4     0    0  0.3\n5     0    0    0\n6   0.1  0.4  0.4\n```\nI want to replace the `col1` values with the values in the second column (`col2`) only if `col1` values are equal to 0, and after (for the zero values remaining), do it again but with the third column (`col3`). The Desired Result is the next one:\n\n```python\n   col1 col2 col3\n1   0.2  0.3  0.3\n2   0.2  0.3  0.3\n3   0.4  0.4  0.4\n4   0.3    0  0.3\n5     0    0    0\n6   0.1  0.4  0.4\n```\nI have tried the following code, but it runs too slow. Is there a faster way to achieve this?\n\n```python\ndf.col1.replace(0,df.col2,inplace=True)\ndf.col1.replace(0,df.col3,inplace=True)\n```"

        "content": "To efficiently replace the values in `col1` using values from `col2` and then `col3`, you can use `numpy` for vectorized operations, which should be faster than using `replace` in a loop. Here's how you can accomplish this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'col1': [0.2, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0.1],\n    'col2': [0.3, 0.3, 0.4, 0, 0, 0.4],\n    'col3': [0.3, 0.3, 0.4, 0.3, 0, 0.4]\n}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Use numpy's where to efficiently replace values\ndf['col1'] = np.where(df['col1'] == 0, df['col2'], df['col1'])\ndf['col1'] = np.where(df['col1'] == 0, df['col3'], df['col1'])\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThis approach uses `numpy.where` to conditionally replace values, which is generally faster than using `replace` with `inplace=True` repeatedly. The `np.where` function checks the condition and replaces the values in `col1` with those in `col2` where the condition is met (i.e., where `col1` is 0). It then does the same with `col3`. This should provide you with the desired outcome more efficiently."
