Here is an example of my current approach:\n```python\ntry:\n    a.method1()\nexcept AttributeError:\n    try:\n        a.method2()\n    except AttributeError:\n        try:\n            a.method3()\n        except AttributeError:\n            raise\n```\nHowever, I find it visually unappealing and somewhat inefficient. I would also prefer not to use the following approach, which checks if a method is present before calling it, in the interest of maintaining maximum efficiency:\n```python\nif hasattr(a, 'method1'):\n    a.method1()\nelif hasattr(a, 'method2'):\n    a.method2()\nelif hasattr(a, 'method3'):\n    a.method3()\nelse:\n    raise AttributeError\n```"

        "content": "You can improve the readability and structure of your nested try statements by using a loop to iterate over the methods you want to try. This approach eliminates the need for deeply nested try-except blocks and maintains efficiency. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nmethods = ['method1', 'method2', 'method3']\n\nfor method in methods:\n    try:\n        getattr(a, method)()\n        break  # Exit the loop if the method call is successful\n    except AttributeError:\n        continue  # Try the next method if AttributeError is raised\nelse:\n    raise AttributeError(\"None of the methods are available.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`methods` list**: Contains the names of the methods you want to attempt to call.\n- **`for` loop**: Iterates over each method name.\n- **`getattr(a, method)()`**: Dynamically retrieves and calls the method on the object `a`. If the method does not exist, `getattr` raises an `AttributeError`.\n- **`break` statement**: Exits the loop if a method call succeeds.\n- **`continue` statement**: Proceeds to the next iteration if an `AttributeError` is caught.\n- **`else` block**: Executes if none of the method calls succeed, raising an `AttributeError`.\n\nThis approach is cleaner, reduces nesting, and maintains efficiency by avoiding the need to check for method existence manually before attempting to call it."
