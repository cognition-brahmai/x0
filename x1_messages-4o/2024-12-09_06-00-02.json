I am unsure how to resolve this issue. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

        "content": "The \"ResourceExhaustedError: OOM (Out of Memory)\" error typically occurs when your model is trying to allocate more memory than is available on your GPU. Here are some strategies you can try to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Reduce Batch Size**: The most straightforward approach is to reduce the batch size. This will reduce the memory requirement per batch. If you are using a batch size of 32, try reducing it to 16 or even 8.\n\n2. **Reduce Model Complexity**: Simplifying your model can help. Here are some specific changes you can make:\n   - Reduce the number of filters in your Conv2D layers.\n   - Use fewer Dense units in your Dense layers.\n   - Consider reducing the number of layers in your model.\n\n3. **Check Input Shape and Data**: Make sure that your input data shapes and sizes are as expected. Using unnecessarily large input sizes can lead to increased memory usage.\n\n4. **Optimize Memory Usage**: Use `tf.keras.backend.clear_session()` at the start of your script to clear any previous models that might be occupying GPU memory.\n\n5. **Mixed Precision Training**: If you're using a compatible NVIDIA GPU, you can enable mixed precision training to reduce memory usage by using lower precision (float16) where possible:\n   ```python\n   from tensorflow.keras.mixed_precision import experimental as mixed_precision\n   policy = mixed_precision.Policy('mixed_float16')\n   mixed_precision.set_policy(policy)\n   ```\n\n6. **Use CPU**: If GPU memory is a constraint, consider using CPU training for prototyping. This will be slower but might fit within your resources.\n\n7. **Use Model Checkpointing and Callbacks**: Save your model checkpoints regularly and use callbacks to monitor memory usage. This can help you resume training after adjusting parameters without starting from scratch.\n\n8. **Gradient Accumulation**: If reducing the batch size significantly impacts your model performance, consider using gradient accumulation to simulate a larger batch size by accumulating gradients over multiple batches before updating the model.\n\nHere's how you can modify your existing code to reduce the batch size:\n\n```python\nhistory = model.fit([trainimage, train_product_embd], train_label,\n    validation_data=([validimage, valid_product_embd], valid_label), epochs=10,\n    steps_per_epoch=100, validation_steps=10, batch_size=8)  # Reduced batch size\n```\n\nTry these strategies and see which one works for you. Adjusting and experimenting with different configurations will help you find a balance that fits within your available resources."
