This assumes you have a table named `countries` with at least two columns: `country_name` and `population`.\n\n```sql\nSELECT country_name\nFROM countries\nWHERE population > 100000000;\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `country_name` and `population` with the actual column names used in your database if they differ. This query selects the names of countries from the `countries` table where the population is greater than 100 million."
