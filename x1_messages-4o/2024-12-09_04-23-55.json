However, the scatter function reads the size 's' in points^2, but I want the area of each point to be represented by a square of area dx^2, where this area is in 'real' units, i.e., the plot units. Here's the code I have so far:\n\n```python\nx = [0.5,0.1,0.3]\ny = [0.2,0.7,0.8]\nz = [10.,15.,12.]\ndx = [0.05,0.2,0.1]\n\nscatter(x,y,c=z,s=dx,marker='s')\n```\nAdditionally, the scatter function plots the markers with a black border by default. How can I change this so that the markers don't have a border?"

        "content": "To create a scatter plot with markers that have a specific size in data units (rather than in points^2), you need to convert the desired area in data units to points^2, since the `scatter` function in Matplotlib uses points^2 for sizing. Additionally, to remove the border around the markers, you can set the `edgecolor` to 'none'.\n\nHere's how you can adjust your code to achieve both of these requirements:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nx = [0.5, 0.1, 0.3]\ny = [0.2, 0.7, 0.8]\nz = [10., 15., 12.]\ndx = [0.05, 0.2, 0.1]\n\n# Convert dx (side length in data units) to area in data units\ndx_area = [d**2 for d in dx]\n\n# Convert area from data units to points^2\n# This conversion is often necessary because the scatter function interprets size as points^2\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\ntrans = ax.transData.transform\ndx_points = [(trans((d, 0)) - trans((0, 0)))[0]**2 for d in dx]\n\n# Plot scatter with squares of specific size and no edge color\nscatter = ax.scatter(x, y, c=z, s=dx_points, marker='s', edgecolor='none')\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Conversion of Size**:\n   - First, compute the area in data units by squaring `dx` to get `dx_area`.\n   - Then, convert these data unit areas to points^2 using a transformation based on the plot's data coordinate system. This is achieved by using the transformation `ax.transData.transform`, which converts data coordinates to display coordinates.\n\n2. **Marker Edge Color**:\n   - By setting the `edgecolor` parameter to `'none'`, you remove the black border around the markers.\n\nThis code will plot your data with markers sized appropriately according to the `dx` values in your data coordinate system, and the markers will have no border."
