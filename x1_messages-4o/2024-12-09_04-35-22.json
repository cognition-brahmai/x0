        "content": "The error you're encountering typically arises from the dynamic linker being unable to locate the shared library for the new Python version. This is because Python 3.7.5 was installed with the `--enable-shared` option, which means it requires the shared library `libpython3.7m.so.1.0` to be in a directory that's recognized by the dynamic linker (ld).\n\nHere's how you can resolve this:\n\n1. **Add the library location to the dynamic linker configuration:**\n\n   The shared library is likely installed under `/usr/local/lib`, since that's where Python installs by default when compiled from source. You need to add this directory to the library path:\n\n   ```bash\n   echo \"/usr/local/lib\" | sudo tee -a /etc/ld.so.conf.d/python3.7.conf\n   ```\n\n2. **Update the dynamic linker run-time bindings:**\n\n   Execute the following command to update the dynamic linker:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo ldconfig\n   ```\n\n   This command updates the necessary links and cache to the most recent shared libraries found in the directories specified in `/etc/ld.so.conf`.\n\n3. **Verify the installation:**\n\n   Check if the `python3.7` command now works:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.7 --version\n   ```\n\nIf you still encounter issues, ensure that the library exists at `/usr/local/lib/libpython3.7m.so.1.0`. If it's not there, you might need to recompile and reinstall Python 3.7.5, ensuring no errors occur during the `make` and `make altinstall` steps.\n\nShould problems persist after these steps, double-check the installation paths and consider potential conflicts with previously installed versions."
