I would like to insert a comma every 3 digits to the left of the decimal point. For example, `10000.00` should become `10,000.00` and `1000000.00` should become `1,000,000.00`. How can I achieve this?"

You can achieve this using Python's format specification mini-language. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nTotalAmount = 10000  # Example value\nprint(\"Total cost is: ${:,.2f}\".format(TotalAmount))\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The `:` indicates the start of the format specification.\n- The `,` adds a comma as a thousands separator.\n- The `.2f` rounds the number to 2 decimal places, formatted as a floating-point number.\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nTotal cost is: $10,000.00\n```\n\nAnd similarly, for `TotalAmount = 1000000`, it will output:\n\n```\nTotal cost is: $1,000,000.00\n```"
