It gives an error message stating that it can't find 'tools'. According to the pySerial documentation, there should be a 'tools' package. Here is the code I am running:\n\n```python\nfrom serial import tools\n```\n\nAnd the error message I receive:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<pyshell#30>\", line 1, in <module>\n    import serial.tools\nImportError: No module named tools\n```\n\nAdditionally, when I check the version of the serial module, it returns '2.5', which is the latest version. Here is the code I am using to check the version:\n\n```python\nserial.VERSION\n```\n\nThis returns:\n\n```python\n'2.5'\n```\n\nSo, why can't I access the 'tools' package of pySerial?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the version of pySerial you're using. The `tools` subpackage, which includes utilities like `list_ports`, was introduced in pySerial version 2.6. Since you are using version 2.5, this subpackage is not available in your installation.\n\nTo resolve this, you should upgrade pySerial to a version that includes the `tools` subpackage. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Upgrade pySerial**: You can upgrade pySerial using pip. First, ensure pip is installed, and then run the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade pyserial\n   ```\n\n   Alternatively, if you're using Python 2.7 and might have multiple versions of pip, you can specify the version:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip2.7 install --upgrade pyserial\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify Installation**: After upgrading, verify the installed version of pySerial:\n\n   ```python\n   import serial\n   print(serial.VERSION)\n   ```\n\n   Ensure that the output reflects a version greater than or equal to 2.6.\n\n3. **Try Importing Tools Again**: Now try importing the `tools` package again:\n\n   ```python\n   from serial import tools\n   ```\n\nIf you continue to face issues, make sure that there are no conflicts with multiple Python environments or installations that might be causing an older version of pySerial to be used. Consider using a virtual environment to manage your dependencies more effectively."
