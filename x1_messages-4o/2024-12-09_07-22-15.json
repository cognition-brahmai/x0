This method is part of the `Collection` class in PyMongo and is used to retrieve a list of all indexes on a collection.\n\nHere's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nfrom pymongo import MongoClient\n\n# Connect to the MongoDB server\nclient = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\n\n# Access the database\ndb = client['your_database_name']\n\n# Access the collection\ncollection = db['your_collection_name']\n\n# List all indexes on the collection\nindexes = collection.list_indexes()\n\n# Iterate over the indexes and print their details\nfor index in indexes:\n    print(index)\n```\n\nThis code connects to a MongoDB database, accesses a specific collection, and lists all the indexes on that collection by iterating through the result of `list_indexes()`. Each index is returned as a dictionary containing details about the index configuration."
