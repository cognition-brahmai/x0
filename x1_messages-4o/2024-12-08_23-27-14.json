Specifically, I want to return \"Happy weekend!\" on Saturdays and Sundays, and \"Hope you have a great start to your week!\" on Mondays. If someone greets me with \"Good morning!\" on a Monday, what would be the appropriate response using this updated function? \n[Go code] \n```go\nfunc greetingByTimeOfDay() string {\n    today := time.Now()\n    weekday := today.Weekday()\n    hour := today.Hour()\n    if weekday == time.Saturday || weekday == time.Sunday {\n        return \"Happy weekend!\"\n    } else if weekday == time.Monday {\n        return \"Hope you have a great start to your week!\"\n    } else if hour >= 5 && hour < 12 {\n        return \"Good morning!\"\n    } else if hour >= 12 && hour < 18 {\n        return \"Good afternoon!\"\n    } else if hour >= 18 && hour < 21 {\n        return \"Good evening!\"\n    } else if (hour >= 21 && today.Minute() >= 30) || (hour < 5) {\n        return \"Good night!\"\n    }\n    return \"\"\n}\n```"

        "content": "To modify the given Go function to add greetings based on the day of the week, we can adjust the logic inside the function. Here's how you can modify it:\n\n1. Check if the day is Saturday or Sunday to return \"Happy weekend!\".\n2. On Monday, check if the time of the day is morning and return \"Hope you have a great start to your week!\" when greeted with \"Good morning!\".\n3. Adjust other greetings based on the time of the day.\n\nHere's the updated Go code:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"time\"\n)\n\nfunc greetingByTimeOfDay(greeting string) string {\n    today := time.Now()\n    weekday := today.Weekday()\n    hour := today.Hour()\n    \n    if weekday == time.Saturday || weekday == time.Sunday {\n        return \"Happy weekend!\"\n    } else if weekday == time.Monday {\n        if greeting == \"Good morning!\" {\n            return \"Hope you have a great start to your week!\"\n        }\n        return \"Hope you have a great start to your week!\"\n    } else if hour >= 5 && hour < 12 {\n        return \"Good morning!\"\n    } else if hour >= 12 && hour < 18 {\n        return \"Good afternoon!\"\n    } else if hour >= 18 && hour < 21 {\n        return \"Good evening!\"\n    } else if (hour >= 21 && today.Minute() >= 30) || (hour < 5) {\n        return \"Good night!\"\n    }\n    return \"\"\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    fmt.Println(greetingByTimeOfDay(\"Good morning!\"))\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `greetingByTimeOfDay` now takes an argument `greeting` that represents the greeting message received.\n- On Mondays, if the received `greeting` is \"Good morning!\", it returns a specific message \"Hope you have a great start to your week!\".\n- For Saturdays and Sundays, it returns \"Happy weekend!\" regardless of the time of the day.\n- For other days, it checks the time to provide the appropriate greeting.\n\nWhen someone greets you with \"Good morning!\" on a Monday, the function will return \"Hope you have a great start to your week!\"."
