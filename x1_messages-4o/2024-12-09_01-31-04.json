In the following example code, I want to recover the return value of the function `worker`. I am unsure how to do this and where the value is stored. \n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\n\ndef worker(procnum):\n    '''worker function'''\n    print str(procnum) + ' represent!'\n    return procnum\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    jobs = []\n    for i in range(5):\n        p = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker, args=(i,))\n        jobs.append(p)\n        p.start()\n\n    for proc in jobs:\n        proc.join()\n    print jobs\n```\n\nWhen I run this code, the output is:\n\n```python\n0 represent!\n1 represent!\n2 represent!\n3 represent!\n4 represent!\n[<Process(Process-1, stopped)>, <Process(Process-2, stopped)>, <Process(Process-3, stopped)>, <Process(Process-4, stopped)>, <Process(Process-5, stopped)>]\n```\n\nHowever, I can't seem to find the relevant attribute in the objects stored in `jobs`. How can I recover the return value of the function `worker`?"

        "content": "In Python's `multiprocessing` module, when you use `multiprocessing.Process`, the return value of the target function is not returned directly. The `Process` class is designed to run a function in a separate process, but it doesn't directly capture the return value of the function. Instead, you can use a `multiprocessing.Queue` or `multiprocessing.Pipe` to send the result back to the parent process.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use a `Queue` to capture the return values:\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\n\ndef worker(procnum, output_queue):\n    '''worker function'''\n    result = f'{procnum} represent!'\n    print(result)\n    output_queue.put(procnum)  # Put the result in the queue\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    jobs = []\n    output_queue = multiprocessing.Queue()\n\n    for i in range(5):\n        p = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker, args=(i, output_queue))\n        jobs.append(p)\n        p.start()\n\n    for proc in jobs:\n        proc.join()\n\n    results = [output_queue.get() for _ in jobs]  # Collect results from the queue\n    print(\"Results:\", results)\n```\n\nIn this version of your code:\n\n1. A `multiprocessing.Queue` is created to collect results from each worker process.\n2. The `worker` function is modified to accept the queue as an argument and uses `output_queue.put(procnum)` to place its result into the queue.\n3. After all processes complete, the main process collects results from the queue using `output_queue.get()`.\n\nThis way, you can recover the return values from each process."
