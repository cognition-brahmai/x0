        "content": "The issue with your code is that you're using the format code `%W`, which represents the week number of the year with Monday as the first day of the week. However, `%W` expects the week number to start with 0, meaning the first week of the year is considered week 0 if it doesn't start on a Monday. In your case, you want to use `%V`, which is for the ISO 8601 week number. Unfortunately, Python's `strptime` doesn't directly support the `%V` directive. Instead, you should use the `isocalendar` method to achieve this.\n\nHere's how you can fix your code:\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\n# Parse the year and week number\nyear, week = map(int, d.split('-W'))\n\n# Use the `fromisocalendar` method to create a date from the ISO year, week, and weekday\n# ISO week starts on Monday, so we use 1 to get the Monday of the given week\nr = datetime.date.fromisocalendar(year, week, 1)\n\nprint(r)\n```\n\nThis will correctly output the date corresponding to the first day (Monday) of the 26th ISO week of 2013."
