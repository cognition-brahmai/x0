I have the following code snippet:\n\n```python\ndictIterator = iter(sorted(bigramDict.iteritems()))\nfor ngram, value in dictIterator:\n    print(\"There are \" + str(value) + \" \" + ngram)\n```\n\nBut this is not sorting the dictionary by values and returning the key/value pairs in order from largest to smallest. Can anyone identify what the problem is or suggest another method of doing this? I would like to avoid using lambda functions as I am not very familiar with them."

        "content": "To sort a dictionary by its values in descending order, you can use the `sorted()` function with a custom key. While you mentioned you'd like to avoid lambda functions, they are a common and concise way to achieve this. However, if you want to avoid them, you can use a helper function instead. Here's how you can modify your code to sort the dictionary by values without using a lambda function:\n\n```python\ndef get_value(item):\n    return item[1]\n\n# Assuming bigramDict is your dictionary\nsorted_items = sorted(bigramDict.items(), key=get_value, reverse=True)\n\nfor ngram, value in sorted_items:\n    print(\"There are \" + str(value) + \" \" + ngram)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening:\n\n1. The `get_value` function takes a tuple (key, value) and returns the value. This function is used as the key for sorting.\n\n2. `sorted(bigramDict.items(), key=get_value, reverse=True)` sorts the items of the dictionary based on the values in descending order.\n\n3. The sorted items are then iterated over, and you can print them as desired.\n\nThis approach will sort the dictionary by values and print the items from largest to smallest value."
