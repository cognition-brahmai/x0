        "content": "The error you're encountering doesn't seem to be directly related to subclassing `threading.Condition`. The code you've provided for subclassing should work correctly, as `threading.Condition` is designed to be subclassed if needed.\n\nThe error message you're seeing:\n\n```\nTypeError: Error when calling the metaclass bases\n    function() argument 1 must be code, not str\n```\n\nsuggests that there might be another issue in your environment or the way the code is being executed. This specific error is not typically associated with subclassing `threading.Condition`.\n\nHere are a few things to check:\n\n1. **Python Version**: Make sure you are using a compatible version of Python. `threading.Condition` has been available for a long time, so any modern version of Python should support it.\n\n2. **Environment Issues**: There might be something off with your Python environment. Try running the code in a fresh Python environment or a different Python interpreter to see if the problem persists.\n\n3. **Code Context**: Ensure there is no other piece of code causing this error. Sometimes errors can occur due to issues elsewhere in the code that might not be immediately obvious.\n\n4. **Script Execution**: Ensure that the script is being executed correctly. If there's an issue in the way the script is being called or if there are other scripts being executed together, it might lead to such errors.\n\nIf none of these suggestions help, please provide more context or any additional code that might be relevant. This will help in diagnosing the problem more accurately."
