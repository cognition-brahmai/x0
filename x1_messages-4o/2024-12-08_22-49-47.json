Let's go through the steps and provide the Python code to compute the derivative in LaTeX notation.\n\n### Steps to Derive the Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the function**: \\( f(x) = x^3 + 2x \\).\n\n2. **Differentiate each term**:\n   - The derivative of \\( x^3 \\) is \\( 3x^2 \\) using the power rule \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = nx^{n-1}\\).\n   - The derivative of \\( 2x \\) is \\( 2 \\).\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   - The derivative of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2 \\).\n\n### Python Code to Derive the Solution in [LaTeX] Notation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, diff, latex\n\n# Define the variable and function\nx = symbols('x')\nf = x**3 + 2*x\n\n# Compute the derivative\nf_prime = diff(f, x)\n\n# Convert to LaTeX notation\nlatex_derivative = latex(f_prime)\n\n# Output the LaTeX derivative\nprint(f\"The derivative of f(x) in LaTeX notation is: {latex_derivative}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation of Finding Maximum and Minimum Values:\n\nThe derivative \\( f'(x) \\) can be used to find the critical points of the function, which are candidates for local maxima and minima.\n\n1. **Find Critical Points**:\n   - Set the derivative equal to zero: \\( f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2 = 0 \\).\n   - Solve for \\( x \\) to find the critical points.\n\n2. **Determine Nature of Critical Points**:\n   - Use the second derivative test or analyze the sign changes of \\( f'(x) \\) around the critical points.\n   - If the second derivative \\( f''(x) > 0 \\) at a critical point, it's a local minimum.\n   - If \\( f''(x) < 0 \\), it's a local maximum.\n   - If \\( f''(x) = 0 \\), the test is inconclusive.\n\nBy analyzing these points, you can determine where the function achieves its maximum and minimum values."
