I want users to be able to install my project with a single command like `python setup.py install` or a call to `pip`. The issue I'm facing is that I need to import numpy in my `setup.py` to get the location of the headers, but I want numpy to be a regular requirement in `install_requires` so that it's automatically downloaded from the Python Package Index. Below is the sample of what I'm currently doing:\n\n```python\nfrom setuptools import setup, Extension\nimport numpy as np\n\next_modules = [Extension('vme', ['vme.c'], extra_link_args=['-lvme'],\n                         include_dirs=[np.get_include()])]\n\nsetup(name='vme',\n      version='0.1',\n      description='Module for communicating over VME with CAEN digitizers.',\n      ext_modules=ext_modules,\n      install_requires=['numpy','pyzmq', 'Sphinx'])\n```\n\nHowever, I can't `import numpy` at the top before it's installed. I've seen a `setup_requires` argument passed to `setup()`, but I can't find any documentation on what it is for. Is it possible to achieve this?"

        "content": "To handle the issue of needing to import numpy to get the header location for C extensions while also ensuring that numpy is installed as a regular dependency, you can make use of the `setup_requires` argument in `setup.py`. This argument specifies dependencies that are required to build the package. It ensures that these build dependencies are installed before the setup script is run.\n\nHere's a modified version of your `setup.py` which uses `setup_requires`:\n\n```python\nfrom setuptools import setup, Extension\nfrom setuptools.command.build_ext import build_ext\nimport sys\n\n\nclass BuildExtNumpy(build_ext):\n    def finalize_options(self):\n        # Ensure that the build dependencies are installed\n        build_ext.finalize_options(self)\n        # Import numpy after the build dependencies have been installed\n        import numpy\n        self.include_dirs.append(numpy.get_include())\n\n\next_modules = [\n    Extension('vme', ['vme.c'], extra_link_args=['-lvme'])\n]\n\nsetup(\n    name='vme',\n    version='0.1',\n    description='Module for communicating over VME with CAEN digitizers.',\n    ext_modules=ext_modules,\n    cmdclass={'build_ext': BuildExtNumpy},\n    setup_requires=['numpy'],  # Ensures numpy is installed before build\n    install_requires=['numpy', 'pyzmq', 'Sphinx']\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Custom `build_ext` class**: We subclass `build_ext` to ensure that numpy is imported only after `setup_requires` has done its job of installing numpy.\n\n2. **`finalize_options()` method**: This method is overridden to import numpy and append its include directory after the setup requirements are resolved.\n\n3. **`setup_requires`**: This option specifies that numpy should be installed before any extensions are built. This is the key to solving your problem, as it ensures numpy is available when you need to import it for the include directory.\n\n4. **`install_requires`**: This remains as is, to ensure that numpy is also installed as a runtime dependency.\n\nThis approach will allow users to install your package with a single command, and it will ensure that `numpy` is available at the time you need to compile any C extensions."
