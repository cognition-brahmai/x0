        "content": "What is the distinction between linear and non-linear regression in machine learning? I understand that w1x1 + w2x2 +...+ wnxn is a linear regression model where w1, w2....wn are the weights and x1, x2...xn are the features. And w1x1^2 + w2x2^2 +...+ wnxn^2 is a non-linear (polynomial) regression model. However, I've come across some lectures stating that a model is linear based on the weights, meaning the coefficients of weights are linear and the degree of the features doesn't matter, whether they are linear(x1) or polynomial(x1^2). Is this true? How does one differentiate a linear and non-linear model? Is it based on weights or feature values?"

        "content": "The distinction between linear and non-linear regression primarily revolves around the relationship between the input features and the model parameters (weights), rather than solely the form of the input features themselves.\n\n1. **Linear Regression**: \n   - A model is considered linear if the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables can be expressed as a linear combination of the parameters (weights). This means that the model is linear in terms of the coefficients.\n   - The equation \\( y = w_0 + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n \\) is a linear model because each term involves a parameter (weight) multiplied by a feature, and the parameters appear linearly (i.e., not raised to any power other than one).\n   - Importantly, even if you transform the features (e.g., using polynomial terms like \\( x^2 \\) or \\( x^3 \\)), as long as the equation remains linear in parameters, it is still considered a linear regression model. For example, \\( y = w_0 + w_1x + w_2x^2 \\) is still linear in terms of the parameters \\( w_0, w_1, \\) and \\( w_2 \\).\n\n2. **Non-Linear Regression**: \n   - A model is non-linear if it involves non-linear combinations of the parameters (weights). This means the parameters themselves are involved in non-linear operations such as multiplication or exponentiation.\n   - For example, models like \\( y = w_0 + w_1x + w_2x^2 + w_3e^{w_4x} \\) or \\( y = w_0 + w_1\\sin(w_2x) \\) are non-linear because the parameters are part of non-linear operations.\n\nIn essence, whether a model is linear or non-linear depends on how the weights (parameters) are used in the model equation. If the equation remains a linear combination of the parameters, it's a linear model, regardless of the transformations applied to the input features. Conversely, if the parameters are involved in non-linear operations, then the model is non-linear.\n\nTherefore, the distinction is based on the linearity of the parameters, not the transformations applied to the feature values."
