You can then use this information to create a chart using a tool like Excel, Google Sheets, or any graphic design software. Here's a comparison of manned and unmanned spacecraft:\n\n| Feature                  | Manned Spacecraft                             | Unmanned Spacecraft                           |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **Purpose**              | Human exploration and research                | Scientific research, exploration, and data collection |\n| **Human Presence**       | Requires life support systems and accommodations for astronauts | No need for life support systems, as there are no humans onboard |\n| **Control**              | Can be controlled manually by astronauts or remotely from Earth | Fully controlled remotely or autonomously |\n| **Cost**                 | Generally more expensive due to life support, safety measures, and human-rated systems | Less expensive since they don't require life support or human-rated systems |\n| **Risk**                 | Higher risk due to human life involvement     | Lower risk since no human life is involved |\n| **Flexibility**          | Can adapt to unexpected situations with human decision-making | Limited to pre-programmed responses and remote commands |\n| **Examples**             | Apollo missions, International Space Station (ISS) | Voyager probes, Mars rovers, Hubble Space Telescope |\n| **Duration of Missions** | Limited by human endurance and life support systems | Can be designed for long-duration missions, sometimes lasting decades |\n| **Payload Capacity**     | Generally lower due to space needed for humans and life support | Can be higher as space is optimized for instruments and equipment |\n| **Scientific Capability**| Human presence allows for immediate decision-making and complex experiments | Equipped with specialized instruments for specific tasks and can explore environments unsafe for humans |\n\nYou can use this table as a basis to create a more detailed and visually appealing chart. Consider using icons or images to make the chart more engaging and easier to understand."
