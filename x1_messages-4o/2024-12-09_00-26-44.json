When I tried to run a python file using ryu-manager with the command `sudo ryu-manager simple_switch.py`, I received an error stating \"No module named gevent\". To resolve this, I attempted to install gevent using `sudo pip install gevent`, but I was met with a 'gcc' error related to a missing file named 'Python.h'. When I tried to locate 'Python.h' using `sudo locate Python.h`, I was unsuccessful. The output of `python -V` is 'Python 2.7.3'. Is 'Python.h' supposed to be present on my system? If so, how can I install it?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the absence of the `Python.h` header file, which is required for building Python C extensions like `gevent`. This file is part of the Python development package, which isn't installed by default in many Linux distributions, including Ubuntu.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to install the Python development package for Python 2.7. Since you're using Ubuntu 12.04, you can install this package using `apt-get`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Update your package list:**\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   ```\n\n2. **Install the Python development package:**\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install python-dev\n   ```\n\n   This command will install the necessary header files, including `Python.h`, that are required for building Python C extensions.\n\n3. **Reinstall gevent:**\n\n   After installing the Python development package, try reinstalling `gevent`:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo pip install gevent\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully install the `gevent` module, and consequently, run your RYU OpenFlow controller without encountering the \"No module named gevent\" error. If you encounter any further issues, make sure your pip and other packages are up to date, or consider moving to a more recent version of Ubuntu, as 12.04 is quite outdated and might not support the latest software dependencies."
