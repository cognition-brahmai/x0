        "content": "In Python, both `difference()` and `symmetric_difference()` are methods used with sets to find differences between them, but they serve slightly different purposes:\n\n1. **`difference()` Method**:\n   - **Purpose**: The `difference()` method returns a new set containing elements that are present in the calling set but not in the specified set(s).\n   - **Usage**: `A.difference(B)` will result in a set containing elements that are in set `A` but not in set `B`.\n   - **Example**:\n     ```python\n     A = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n     B = {3, 4, 5, 6}\n     result = A.difference(B)  # result will be {1, 2}\n     ```\n\n2. **`symmetric_difference()` Method**:\n   - **Purpose**: The `symmetric_difference()` method returns a new set containing elements that are in either one of the sets but not in both.\n   - **Usage**: `A.symmetric_difference(B)` will result in a set containing elements that are unique to each set.\n   - **Example**:\n     ```python\n     A = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n     B = {3, 4, 5, 6}\n     result = A.symmetric_difference(B)  # result will be {1, 2, 5, 6}\n     ```\n\nIn summary:\n- `difference()` finds elements that are in one set but not in another.\n- `symmetric_difference()` finds elements that are in either of the sets but not in both."
