For instance, if I have a dataframe with data spanning multiple years and various genders, how can I filter to see only males for the year 2014? Additionally, how can I accomplish this in a loop, creating a dataframe object for each unique combination of year and gender (e.g., a dataframe for 2013-Male, 2013-Female, 2014-Male, 2014-Female)?"

        "content": "To filter a pandas DataFrame by multiple columns, you can use boolean indexing. For example, if you have a DataFrame and you want to filter it to see only males for the year 2014, you can do the following:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'year': [2013, 2014, 2014, 2015],\n    'gender': ['Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female'],\n    'value': [10, 20, 30, 40]\n}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Filter for males in 2014\nfiltered_df = df[(df['year'] == 2014) & (df['gender'] == 'Male')]\nprint(filtered_df)\n```\n\nTo generate separate DataFrame objects for each unique combination of year and gender, you can use a loop to iterate over the unique combinations and store each filtered DataFrame in a dictionary for easy access:\n\n```python\n# Dictionary to hold the filtered DataFrames\nfiltered_dfs = {}\n\n# Get unique combinations of year and gender\nunique_combinations = df[['year', 'gender']].drop_duplicates()\n\n# Iterate over each unique combination\nfor _, row in unique_combinations.iterrows():\n    year = row['year']\n    gender = row['gender']\n    \n    # Filter DataFrame for the current combination of year and gender\n    filtered_df = df[(df['year'] == year) & (df['gender'] == gender)]\n    \n    # Create a key for the dictionary\n    key = f\"{year}-{gender}\"\n    \n    # Store the filtered DataFrame in the dictionary\n    filtered_dfs[key] = filtered_df\n\n# Access the DataFrames for each combination\nfor key, df in filtered_dfs.items():\n    print(f\"DataFrame for {key}:\")\n    print(df)\n```\n\nThis code will create a separate DataFrame for each unique combination of year and gender and store them in a dictionary with keys like `\"2014-Male\"`, `\"2014-Female\"`, etc. You can then access each DataFrame using its key."
