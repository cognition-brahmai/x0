I know that using 'Esc' + '.' gives me the last argument of the previous command, but how can I get the first argument instead? Also, is there a key binding to do this? Furthermore, is there a method to retrieve the nth argument from the last command? I know in a bash script, I can use $0, $1 etc., but these don't seem to work on the command line. Lastly, is there a way to iterate through the 0th argument of previous commands, similar to how we can do with the last argument by continuously pressing 'Esc' + '.'?"

        "content": "In a Bash shell, there are several ways to access arguments from previous commands using keyboard shortcuts and shell history expansion. Here are some methods to achieve what you're looking for:\n\n### Accessing Specific Arguments from the Previous Command\n\n1. **First Argument**: \n   - You can use the history expansion feature in Bash to get the first argument of the previous command. Use `!^` to refer to the first argument of the previous command. For example, if your previous command was `ls /home/user`, typing `echo !^` will expand to `echo /home/user`.\n\n2. **Nth Argument**:\n   - Similarly, you can use `!:n` to get the nth argument. For example, `!:2` will give you the second argument of the last command. If your previous command was `cp file1 file2 /destination`, typing `echo !:2` will expand to `echo file2`.\n\n3. **All Arguments**:\n   - To get all arguments of the previous command, you can use `!:`. For example, `!:*` will expand to all arguments of the previous command.\n\n### Key Bindings\n\n- Unfortunately, there is no default key binding in Bash to directly access the first or nth argument similar to `Esc` + `.` for the last argument. However, you can use the history expansion techniques mentioned above for this purpose.\n\n### Iterating Over Previous Commands\n\n- Bash does not have a built-in mechanism to iterate through the 0th argument (the command itself) of previous commands using a simple key press. However, you can view your command history using the `history` command and then use `!<history_number>` to repeat a specific command.\n\n### Custom Key Bindings\n\nIf you often need to access specific arguments from previous commands, you could consider writing custom shell functions or scripts to assist with this. For example, you can create a shell function to easily access certain arguments and bind it to a key combination using `bind`. However, this would require some additional setup in your shell configuration file (like `.bashrc`).\n\nUsing these techniques, you can efficiently work with previous command arguments in the Bash shell."
