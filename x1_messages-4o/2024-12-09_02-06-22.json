This problem only appears on new machines that are dynamically opened and closed. The error seems to be raised when the `endpoint` and `region_name` are `None`. Why is this error occurring and why does it only appear part of the time?\n\n```python\nif endpoint is None:\n    if region_name is None:\n        # Raise a more specific error message that will give\n        # better guidance to the user what needs to happen.\n        raise NoRegionError()\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, `NoRegionError: You must specify a region`, is due to the fact that when you create a `boto3.client`, it requires a specific AWS region to be set. This region information is necessary for `boto3` to construct the correct endpoint URL to communicate with the AWS service.\n\nThis error occurs when the `region_name` is not specified in your configuration, and `boto3` cannot automatically determine which region to use. Here are some potential reasons why this may happen and how you can resolve it:\n\n1. **Environment Configuration**: On new machines, your AWS SDK configuration might not be set up. Ensure that your AWS credentials and region configuration are properly set in one of the following ways:\n   - **AWS Configuration Files**: Make sure that your `~/.aws/config` file contains a default region:\n     ```\n     [default]\n     region = us-west-2\n     ```\n   - **Environment Variables**: You can also set the `AWS_REGION` environment variable:\n     ```bash\n     export AWS_REGION=us-west-2\n     ```\n\n2. **Explicitly Specify the Region**: You can provide the region directly when creating the `boto3` client:\n   ```python\n   client = boto3.client('kms', region_name='us-west-2')\n   ```\n\n3. **Dynamically Set the Region**: If these machines are dynamically created and closed, ensure that the environment or the initialization script sets the region before any `boto3` client is initiated.\n\n4. **IAM Roles and EC2 Instances**: If the code runs on an EC2 instance, ensure that the instance has an IAM role attached with the necessary permissions and that the EC2 instance's metadata service can provide region information.\n\n5. **Docker and Virtual Environments**: If using Docker or virtual environments, make sure that the necessary environment variables or configuration files are correctly passed into those environments.\n\nBy ensuring that the region is specified through one of these methods, you should be able to resolve the `NoRegionError` and have consistent behavior across different environments and machines."
