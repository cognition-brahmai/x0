Here is the code I've tried so far:\n\n```python\nAM_train['product_category_2'].fillna('Unknown', inplace =True)\nAM_train['city_development_index'].fillna('Missing', inplace =True)\n```\n\nThis code worked fine on a different kernel with the same dataset, where the only difference is that the features were of float64 data type. I've since converted these feature data types into Categorical because all the features in the dataset represent categories. Can someone help me figure out why I'm receiving this error and how to fix it?"

        "content": "The error message \"fill value must be in categories\" indicates that you're trying to fill missing values in a Pandas Series of categorical data type with a value that isn't recognized as a valid category. When a column is of the categorical type in Pandas, all values, including those used to fill missing values, must be among the predefined categories.\n\nHere's how you can fix this issue:\n\n1. **Add the Missing Categories:**\n   You need to ensure that the values you're using to fill the NaNs ('Unknown' and 'Missing') are included in the list of categories for each column.\n\nHere's how you can adjust your code:\n\n```python\n# Ensure 'Unknown' is in the categories for 'product_category_2'\nif 'Unknown' not in AM_train['product_category_2'].cat.categories:\n    AM_train['product_category_2'] = AM_train['product_category_2'].cat.add_categories('Unknown')\n\n# Fill NaNs with 'Unknown' for 'product_category_2'\nAM_train['product_category_2'].fillna('Unknown', inplace=True)\n\n# Ensure 'Missing' is in the categories for 'city_development_index'\nif 'Missing' not in AM_train['city_development_index'].cat.categories:\n    AM_train['city_development_index'] = AM_train['city_development_index'].cat.add_categories('Missing')\n\n# Fill NaNs with 'Missing' for 'city_development_index'\nAM_train['city_development_index'].fillna('Missing', inplace=True)\n```\n\n2. **Explanation:**\n   - `cat.add_categories()`: This method is used to add a new category to a categorical column. If the fill value is not part of the existing categories, adding it first allows you to use it with `fillna()`.\n   - By checking if the fill value is already in the categories, you avoid adding duplicate categories.\n\nThis should resolve the ValueError you're encountering. Make sure you apply this process to all categorical columns where you need to fill missing values with new categories."
