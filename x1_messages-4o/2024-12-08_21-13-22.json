Could you also provide a concise implementation in HTML and JavaScript to achieve this task? \nHere is the JSON data for Array 1 and Array 2:\n```\n{\n   \"Array 1\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n   \"Array 2\": [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n}\n```\nPlease provide the code in [Mark down] format."

        "content": "To find the intersection of two arrays efficiently in JavaScript, you can use the `filter` method in combination with the `Set` object. This approach leverages the `Set` to provide fast lookup times, making the intersection operation more efficient.\n\nBelow is a concise implementation using HTML and JavaScript:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Array Intersection</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<h2>Intersection of Two Arrays</h2>\n<div id=\"result\"></div>\n\n<script>\n    const array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n    const array2 = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7];\n\n    function findIntersection(arr1, arr2) {\n        const set2 = new Set(arr2);\n        return arr1.filter(item => set2.has(item));\n    }\n\n    const intersection = findIntersection(array1, array2);\n\n    document.getElementById('result').textContent = `Intersection: [${intersection.join(', ')}]`;\n</script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Set**: The `Set` object is used to store unique values. Here, it is used for `array2` to allow O(1) average-time complexity for lookups.\n\n2. **Array.prototype.filter**: This method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. In this case, it checks if each element of `array1` is present in `set2`.\n\nThis code will display the intersection of the two arrays (i.e., `[3, 4, 5]`) on the webpage."
