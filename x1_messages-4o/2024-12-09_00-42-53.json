        "content": "You can check if a NumPy array is sorted by using the `numpy.all()` function in combination with comparison operations. Here's how you can confirm if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n\n# Check if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order\nis_sorted = np.all(a[:-1] <= a[1:])\n\nprint(is_sorted)  # Output: True\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, `a[:-1]` gives you all elements of the array except the last one, and `a[1:]` gives you all elements except the first one. The comparison `a[:-1] <= a[1:]` checks if each element is less than or equal to the next element, and `np.all()` verifies that this condition holds true for all pairs of consecutive elements.\n\nIf you want to check if the array is sorted in strictly increasing order (i.e., each element is strictly less than the next one), you can modify the comparison to `<`:\n\n```python\n# Check if the array is sorted in strictly increasing order\nis_strictly_sorted = np.all(a[:-1] < a[1:])\n\nprint(is_strictly_sorted)  # Output: True\n```\n\nYou can adjust these checks according to your specific sorting requirements."
