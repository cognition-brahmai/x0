How can I do this in MATLAB?\nHere is an example code:\nx = linspace(0,10);\ny1 = sin(x);\ny2 = cos(x);\nplot(x,y1,'-b',x,y2,'--r','LineWidth',2)\nlegend('y1','y2')\nxlabel('x-axis')\nylabel('y-axis')\ntitle('Plot with multiple data sets')\nThis will generate a plot with both y1 and y2 plotted on the same graph with different line styles and colors. You can further customize the plot by adding additional MATLAB commands and formatting options."

        "content": "Your provided MATLAB code is a great example of how to create a simple plot with multiple data sets. Let's break it down and review how each part contributes to plotting multiple data sets on a single graph:\n\n1. **Data Generation**:\n   - `x = linspace(0,10);`: This generates a vector `x` with 100 points linearly spaced between 0 and 10.\n   - `y1 = sin(x);`: Computes the sine of each value in `x`, resulting in `y1`.\n   - `y2 = cos(x);`: Computes the cosine of each value in `x`, resulting in `y2`.\n\n2. **Plotting**:\n   - `plot(x, y1, '-b', x, y2, '--r', 'LineWidth', 2)`: This command plots both `y1` and `y2` against `x` on the same graph. \n     - `'-b'` specifies a solid blue line for `y1`.\n     - `'--r'` specifies a dashed red line for `y2`.\n     - `'LineWidth', 2` sets the width of both lines to 2.\n\n3. **Customization**:\n   - `legend('y1', 'y2')`: Adds a legend to the plot, labeling `y1` and `y2` datasets.\n   - `xlabel('x-axis')`: Labels the x-axis as 'x-axis'.\n   - `ylabel('y-axis')`: Labels the y-axis as 'y-axis'.\n   - `title('Plot with multiple data sets')`: Adds a title to the plot.\n\n4. **Enhancements**:\n   - You can further customize the plot by adjusting the axis limits using `xlim` and `ylim`.\n   - Add grid lines with `grid on`.\n   - Customize fonts and sizes with `set(gca, 'FontSize', 12)` or similar commands.\n\nHere's the complete code with a few additional customizations:\n\n```matlab\nx = linspace(0,10);\ny1 = sin(x);\ny2 = cos(x);\n\nfigure; % Optional: Opens a new figure window\nplot(x, y1, '-b', x, y2, '--r', 'LineWidth', 2);\nlegend('y1', 'y2');\nxlabel('x-axis');\nylabel('y-axis');\ntitle('Plot with Multiple Data Sets');\ngrid on; % Adds grid lines to the plot\nset(gca, 'FontSize', 12); % Adjusts the font size of the axes\n\n% Optional: Set axis limits\nxlim([0 10]);\nylim([-1.5 1.5]);\n```\n\nThis code will create a clear, informative graph that displays both `y1` and `y2` with distinct styles, making it easy to compare the two datasets visually. Feel free to adjust the styles and add more customizations as needed for your specific requirements."
