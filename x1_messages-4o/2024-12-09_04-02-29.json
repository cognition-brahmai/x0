I know how to change the face color of the plot using:\n```python\nfig = plt.figure()\nfig.patch.set_facecolor('xkcd:mint green')\n```\nHowever, this only changes the color of the space around the plot, not the actual background of the plot. How can I change the actual background color of the plot?"

        "content": "To change the background color of the actual plot area (also known as the axes), you can use the `set_facecolor` method on the axes object itself. Here's how you can do that for a scatter plot:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Create some data for the scatter plot\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ny = [10, 20, 25, 30, 40]\n\n# Create a figure and an axes\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Set the background color of the plot area (axes)\nax.set_facecolor('black')\n\n# Create the scatter plot\nax.scatter(x, y, color='white')  # Use a color that stands out against the background\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `fig, ax = plt.subplots()` creates a figure and a set of subplots (in this case, just one subplot).\n- `ax.set_facecolor('black')` sets the background color of the plot area to black.\n- The scatter plot is created with `ax.scatter()`, and I've set the scatter points to white to ensure they are visible against the black background.\n\nThis will give you a plot with a black background in the plot area itself."
