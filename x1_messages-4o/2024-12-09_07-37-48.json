        "content": "I am working with Python and Django and I have a function that dynamically generates a Django form with the fields I specify. The function is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef quiz_form_factory(question):\n    properties = {\n        'question': forms.IntegerField(widget=forms.HiddenInput, initial=question.id),\n        'answers': forms.ModelChoiceField(queryset=question.answers_set)\n    }\n    return type('QuizForm', (forms.Form,), properties)\n```\n\nI want to write a test for this function. Specifically, I want to check if the 'QuizForm' class that is returned by this function is inherited from 'forms.Form'. I am looking for a way to do something like this:\n\n```python\nself.assertTrue(QuizForm isinheritedfrom forms.Form)  # I know this does not exist\n```\n\nIs there any way in Python to test if a class is inherited from another class?"

        "content": "Yes, in Python, you can check if a class is inherited from another class using the `issubclass()` function. This function returns `True` if a class is a subclass of another class, including indirect inheritance. For your specific case, you can test if `QuizForm` is inherited from `forms.Form` like this:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\nfrom django import forms\n\nclass QuizFormFactoryTest(unittest.TestCase):\n\n    def test_quiz_form_inherits_from_forms_form(self):\n        # Assuming you have a mock or a real question object\n        question = ... # Your setup for a question object\n        \n        # Generate the form class using your factory function\n        QuizForm = quiz_form_factory(question)\n        \n        # Use issubclass to check inheritance\n        self.assertTrue(issubclass(QuizForm, forms.Form), \"QuizForm should inherit from forms.Form\")\n```\n\nMake sure you have the necessary setup for your question object to test the `quiz_form_factory` function properly. This code snippet should be part of a test case class that uses `unittest.TestCase`. The `issubclass()` function is specifically designed for checking class inheritance, and it will help you achieve what you're looking for."
