        "content": "Certainly! Unpacking in Python is a powerful feature that allows you to assign the elements of a sequence (like a list or tuple) to variables in a single statement. Let's go through each type of unpacking you mentioned and explain how you can deduce the results.\n\n### 1. Simple Sequence Assignment\nThis is the most straightforward form of unpacking. You have a sequence on the right-hand side, and you assign its elements to variables on the left-hand side.\n\nExample:\n```python\na, b, c = [1, 2, 3]\n```\nHere, `a` will be `1`, `b` will be `2`, and `c` will be `3`.\n\nFor simple sequence assignment:\n- Ensure that the number of variables on the left matches the number of elements in the sequence on the right.\n- If they don't match, you'll get a `ValueError`.\n\n### 2. Nested Sequence Assignment\nThis involves sequences within sequences.\n\nExample:\n```python\n(a, b), c = [1, 2], 3\n```\nIn this case, `a` will be `1`, `b` will be `2`, and `c` will be `3`.\n\nFor nested sequence assignment:\n- The structure of the variables on the left should match the structure of the sequence on the right.\n- Again, mismatches in structure or number will result in a `ValueError`.\n\n### 3. Extended Sequence Unpacking\nIntroduced in Python 3, this allows you to capture multiple elements using the `*` operator.\n\nExample:\n```python\na, *b, c = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\nHere, `a` will be `1`, `c` will be `5`, and `b` will be `[2, 3, 4]`.\n\nFor extended sequence unpacking:\n- Only one variable can be prefixed with `*` to capture the \"rest\" of the elements, and it can be placed anywhere: at the start, middle, or end.\n- The `*` variable will always be a list, even if there are no elements to capture (it will be an empty list in that case).\n\n### Common Errors\n1. **ValueError**: This occurs when the number of variables doesn't match the number of elements in the sequence, or when the structure is mismatched in nested unpacking.\n2. **SyntaxError**: You might encounter this if the unpacking syntax is incorrect, such as using multiple starred expressions in one assignment.\n\n### Practice Example\nLet's practice with an example to deduce the result:\n\n```python\nx, (y, *z), w = 1, (2, 3, 4), 5\n```\nHere's the breakdown:\n- `x` is `1`.\n- The tuple `(2, 3, 4)` is unpacked: `y` is `2`, `*z` captures `[3, 4]`.\n- `w` is `5`.\n\nBy understanding the rules of unpacking, you can deduce the values of variables correctly.
