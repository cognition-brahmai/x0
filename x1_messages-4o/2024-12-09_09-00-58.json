        "content": "To calculate the average age of all current users on a website using MongoDB, you can utilize the aggregation framework. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to construct the query:\n\nAssuming you have a collection named `users` and each document has an `age` field representing the user's age, the aggregation query would look like this:\n\n```javascript\ndb.users.aggregate([\n  {\n    $group: {\n      _id: null, // We use null to group all documents together\n      averageAge: { $avg: \"$age\" }\n    }\n  }\n])\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what this query does:\n\n1. **$group**: This stage is used to group documents based on some criteria. By setting `_id: null`, we are grouping all documents together into a single group.\n\n2. **$avg**: This operator is used to calculate the average value of the specified field, in this case, the `age` field.\n\nAs a result, this aggregation pipeline will output a document with the average age of all users in the collection. If your users have additional criteria for being \"current\" (e.g., active status or a recent login date), you can add a `$match` stage before the `$group` stage to filter the documents accordingly. For example:\n\n```javascript\ndb.users.aggregate([\n  {\n    $match: {\n      status: \"active\" // Assuming 'status' is a field that indicates if a user is active\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    $group: {\n      _id: null,\n      averageAge: { $avg: \"$age\" }\n    }\n  }\n])\n```\n\nThis modified query first filters the users to include only those with an `active` status before calculating the average age. Adjust the `$match` condition according to your specific criteria for current users."
