You want to exclude both spaces and newline characters, so your character class should negate both of these characters. You can do this by using a character class that includes both exclusions, like this: `[^ \\n]+`.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the regular expression:\n\n- `[^ ]`: This part negates the space character.\n- `[^ \\n]`: This part negates both space and newline characters.\n- `+`: This quantifier indicates that you want to match one or more of these non-space and non-newline characters.\n\nSo, the combined regular expression `[^\\s\\n]+` will match one or more occurrences of any character except for spaces and newlines. You can use this pattern in your code or tool that supports regular expressions on Windows."
