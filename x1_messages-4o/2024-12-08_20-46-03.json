        "content": "The irony in the sentence comes from the contrast between the two parts of the statement. The speaker mentions that their parents have given permission to go to the party, which would typically be seen as a positive or freeing outcome. However, the irony lies in the fact that they had already bought the tickets, implying they were going to attend the party regardless of whether they received permission. This highlights a humorous or sarcastic twist, as the permission seems unnecessary or redundant given the speaker's prior actions."
