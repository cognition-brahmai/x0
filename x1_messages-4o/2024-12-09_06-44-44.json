I am reading a CSV file using `csv.reader(open('geocoded_output.csv', 'rb'), delimiter='\\t', quotechar='\"')` and attempting to encode it with utf-8. However, when I run the program, I get a UnicodeDecodeError: `'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xd1 in position 2: ordinal not in range(128)`. How can I correctly handle these non-standard characters as per my job requirements to use unicode?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is a common issue in Python 2.7 when dealing with non-ASCII characters. By default, Python 2.7 uses ASCII encoding, which can't handle characters like \u00d1 and \u00c9. To properly handle these characters, you should ensure that your data is being read and processed with the correct encoding. Here's a step-by-step guide to handle this situation:\n\n1. **Use `codecs` to Open the File:**\n   Instead of using the built-in `open`, you can use the `codecs` module to specify the encoding when opening the file.\n\n   ```python\n   import csv\n   import codecs\n\n   with codecs.open('geocoded_output.csv', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:\n       reader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter='\\t', quotechar='\"')\n       for row in reader:\n           # Process each row\n           print(row)\n   ```\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Encoding when Writing:**\n   If you need to write data back to a file, ensure you write it with the correct encoding.\n\n   ```python\n   with codecs.open('output.csv', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:\n       writer = csv.writer(csvfile, delimiter='\\t', quotechar='\"', quoting=csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL)\n       for row in your_data:\n           writer.writerow(row)\n   ```\n\n3. **Use `unicodecsv` Library:**\n   Alternatively, you can use the `unicodecsv` library which is designed to handle CSV files with Unicode characters more gracefully.\n\n   First, you need to install the `unicodecsv` module:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install unicodecsv\n   ```\n\n   Then, use it like this:\n\n   ```python\n   import unicodecsv\n\n   with open('geocoded_output.csv', 'rb') as csvfile:\n       reader = unicodecsv.reader(csvfile, encoding='utf-8', delimiter='\\t', quotechar='\"')\n       for row in reader:\n           print(row)\n   ```\n\n4. **Decode Strings:**\n   If you're still having issues, ensure that any string manipulation is done after decoding the strings into Unicode objects. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   for row in reader:\n       row = [cell.decode('utf-8') if isinstance(cell, str) else cell for cell in row]\n       # Now you can process each row safely\n       print(row)\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to handle non-standard characters in your dataset without encountering the `UnicodeDecodeError`."
