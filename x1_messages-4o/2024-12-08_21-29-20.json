        "content": "To determine if an event is \"just around the corner\" using Scala, you can compare the current date with the `eventDate`. Let's assume that an event is considered \"just around the corner\" if it is within the next 7 days. You can use the `java.time` package to achieve this. Here's a code snippet that demonstrates how you can implement this logic:\n\n```scala\nimport java.time.{LocalDate, Period}\n\nobject EventChecker {\n  def isEventJustAroundTheCorner(eventDate: LocalDate): Boolean = {\n    val currentDate = LocalDate.now()\n    val periodBetween = Period.between(currentDate, eventDate)\n    val daysUntilEvent = periodBetween.getDays\n\n    daysUntilEvent >= 0 && daysUntilEvent <= 7\n  }\n\n  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\n    val eventDate = LocalDate.of(2023, 11, 20) // Example event date\n    if (isEventJustAroundTheCorner(eventDate)) {\n      println(\"The event is just around the corner!\")\n    } else {\n      println(\"The event is not just around the corner.\")\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We define a method `isEventJustAroundTheCorner` that takes `eventDate` as a parameter.\n- We use `LocalDate.now()` to get the current date.\n- We calculate the period between the current date and the event date using `Period.between`.\n- We check if the number of days between the current date and the event date is between 0 and 7, inclusive. If it is, we consider the event \"just around the corner\".\n- We then print a message based on whether the event is considered \"just around the corner\". \n\nThis code will output \"The event is just around the corner!\" if the event is within the next 7 days, and \"The event is not just around the corner.\" otherwise. Adjust the `eventDate` to test with different dates."
