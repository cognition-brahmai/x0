When I use the update method, it doesn't add a new pair but rather it deletes the previous values. As a result, when I print the dictionary, I only see the last value. Here is the code I have been using:\n\n```python\ni = 0\nfor o in iterload(f):\n    i=i+1\n    mydic = {i : o[\"name\"]}\n    mydic.update({i : o[\"name\"]})\n    for k, v in mydic.items():\n        print(k,v) \nprint(mydic)\n```\n\n`f` is a file that I'm parsing with Python code. The result I get is `{3: 'toto'}` which is the last element. I would like to know how to add all the elements to my dictionary.\n\nAdditionally, I am trying to check if an input value equals a key from my dictionary and if so, I want to get the value of this key to continue parsing the file and get other information. Here is the code I am using for this:\n\n```python\nf = open('myfile','r')\nnb_name = input(\"\\nChoose the number of the name :\")\n\nfor o in iterload(f):\n    if o[\"name\"] == mydic[nb_name]: \n        ...\n```\n\nI get a KeyError as follows:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \".../test.py\", line 37, in &lt;module&gt;\n            if o[\"name\"] == mydic[nb_name]: \nKeyError: '1'\n```\n\nI'm not sure why this is happening and how to resolve it."

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with your dictionary is due to the way you're updating it inside the loop. Each time you set `mydic = {i: o[\"name\"]}`, you're redefining `mydic` as a new dictionary with a single key-value pair, thus overwriting the previous contents.\n\nTo dynamically add key-value pairs to your dictionary without overwriting, you should initialize the dictionary outside the loop and use the assignment operator to add new entries. As for the KeyError, it seems to be related to how you're handling string vs integer keys in your dictionary. Let's address both issues:\n\n1. **Inserting Keys and Values Dynamically:**\n\n   Initialize the dictionary outside of the loop, and use the assignment operator to add new key-value pairs:\n\n   ```python\n   mydic = {}  # Initialize the dictionary outside the loop\n   i = 0\n   for o in iterload(f):\n       i += 1\n       mydic[i] = o[\"name\"]  # Add new key-value pairs\n       for k, v in mydic.items():\n           print(k, v)\n   print(mydic)\n   ```\n\n2. **Checking for Key and Handling Input:**\n\n   The `input()` function returns a string, but your dictionary keys are integers. You need to convert the input to an integer before using it to access the dictionary:\n\n   ```python\n   f = open('myfile', 'r')\n   nb_name = int(input(\"\\nChoose the number of the name: \"))  # Convert input to int\n\n   for o in iterload(f):\n       if o[\"name\"] == mydic.get(nb_name):  # Use .get() to safely access the value\n           # Continue parsing the file and get other information\n           ...\n   ```\n\nUsing `mydic.get(nb_name)` helps avoid `KeyError` by returning `None` instead of raising an error if the key does not exist. You can handle `None` as needed in your logic.\n\nWith these changes, your code should correctly accumulate the dictionary entries and handle user input for key lookup."
