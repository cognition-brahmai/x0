However, when I write \"print 2 ** 100\", it gives me a \"SyntaxError: invalid syntax\", pointing at the 2. I am unsure of why this is happening. Can someone explain why this is happening? I am using Python version 3.1."

The syntax error you're encountering is because you're using the old Python 2 syntax for `print`. \n\nHere's how you can fix your code:\n\n```python\nprint(2 ** 100)\n```\n\nThis should work without any issues in Python 3.1. The `**` operator is used for exponentiation, so `2 ** 100` calculates 2 raised to the power of 100, and the `print()` function will display the result."
