        "content": "The error message you're encountering indicates a mismatch between the CUDA driver version and the CUDA runtime version. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Update CUDA Driver**: Ensure that you have the latest CUDA driver installed. The driver version should be compatible with the CUDA toolkit version you are using. You can download the latest driver from the NVIDIA website.\n\n2. **Check CUDA Toolkit Version**: Make sure that the CUDA toolkit version you are using (3.1 in your case) is compatible with your system and the code you are trying to run. Sometimes, using a newer version of the toolkit can resolve compatibility issues.\n\n3. **Compatibility with Visual Studio**: CUDA 3.1 is quite old, and it might not have full compatibility with Visual Studio 2008. Consider upgrading your development environment to a newer version of Visual Studio that is supported by the CUDA version you are using.\n\n4. **Emulation Mode**: Running in emulation mode is not recommended for performance and compatibility reasons. If possible, try running the code on actual hardware with a compatible GPU.\n\n5. **Rebuild the Project**: Sometimes, rebuilding the entire project can resolve issues caused by corrupted build files. Clean your solution and then rebuild it.\n\n6. **Check for Code Updates**: If the example code is from a third-party source, check if there are any updates or patches available that address this issue.\n\n7. **CUDA Samples**: Try running CUDA samples that come with the SDK to see if they work correctly. This can help determine if the issue is with your specific code or a broader compatibility issue.\n\n8. **Environment Variables**: Ensure that your environment variables are set correctly. This includes `CUDA_PATH`, `PATH`, and other relevant variables for the CUDA toolkit and Visual Studio.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues, consider seeking additional support from NVIDIA's developer forums or checking their documentation for further troubleshooting steps specific to your configuration."
