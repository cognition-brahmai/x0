For example, with the input \"3 5 4 9\", I remove the first element to get the list ['5', '4', '9'] and I want to sum these elements to get 18. Here's the code I have so far:\n\n<pre><code>\nl = raw_input()\nl = l.split(' ')\nl.pop(0)\n</code></pre>\n\nHow can I modify this code to get the sum of the elements in the list?"

        "content": "To sum the elements of the list after removing the first element, you can convert the remaining elements to integers and then use the `sum()` function to get the total. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nl = raw_input()  # For Python 2, use input() for Python 3\nl = l.split(' ')\nl.pop(0)\n\n# Convert the remaining elements to integers\nint_list = [int(x) for x in l]\n\n# Calculate the sum of the integers\ntotal = sum(int_list)\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\nHere's a brief explanation of the changes:\n\n1. After splitting the input string, you use `l.pop(0)` to remove the first element.\n2. You convert the remaining elements of the list from strings to integers using a list comprehension: `[int(x) for x in l]`.\n3. Finally, you calculate the sum of the list using the `sum()` function and print the result.\n\nIf you're using Python 3, replace `raw_input()` with `input()`."
