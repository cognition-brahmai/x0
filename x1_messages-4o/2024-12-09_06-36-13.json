When I replace the hard-coded logger names in the cookbook example with the `__name__` constant, the example breaks down and I only receive logging messages from the main module and none from the auxiliary module. The structure of my package folder is as follows: \n\n```\ncookbook-example\n|- __init__.py\n|- main_module.py\n|- auxiliary_module.py\n```\n\nIn my `main_module.py`, I have the following code: \n\n```python\nimport logging\nimport auxiliary_module\n\n# create and configure main logger\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n# create console handler with a higher log level\nhandler = logging.StreamHandler()\nhandler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n# create formatter and add it to the handler\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nhandler.setFormatter(formatter)\n# add the handler to the logger\nlogger.addHandler(handler)\n\nlogger.info('message from main module')\nauxiliary_module.some_function()\n```\n\nAnd in my `auxiliary_module.py`, I have the following code: \n\n```python\nimport logging\n\n# create logger\nmodule_logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) \n\ndef some_function():\n    module_logger.info('message from auxiliary module')\n```\n\nWhat am I doing wrong that is causing the logging messages from the auxiliary module to not appear?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely due to the logger hierarchy and configuration in your setup. In Python's logging system, loggers are hierarchical and the logger names reflect this hierarchy. When you use `__name__`, it sets the logger's name to the module's fully qualified name, which affects how the loggers are configured and propagate messages.\n\nHere are a few steps to ensure that logging messages from both the main and auxiliary modules appear as expected:\n\n1. **Ensure Logger Propagation**: By default, loggers propagate messages to their parent loggers unless explicitly disabled. Ensure that the logger in `auxiliary_module.py` is allowed to propagate messages to the main logger.\n\n2. **Configure the Root Logger**: Instead of configuring the logger in the `main_module.py` specifically, configure the root logger. This way, all loggers that are children of the root logger (including those created with `getLogger(__name__)`) will inherit the configuration.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n**main_module.py:**\n\n```python\nimport logging\nimport auxiliary_module\n\n# Configure the root logger\nlogging.basicConfig(\n    level=logging.DEBUG,\n    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'\n)\n\n# Get the logger for the main module\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\nlogger.info('message from main module')\nauxiliary_module.some_function()\n```\n\n**auxiliary_module.py:**\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\n# Get the logger for the auxiliary module\nmodule_logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) \n\ndef some_function():\n    module_logger.info('message from auxiliary module')\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Logger Configuration**: By using `logging.basicConfig()`, you're configuring the root logger. This configuration will be inherited by all other loggers, including those created with `getLogger(__name__)`.\n\n- **Propagation**: Ensure that logger propagation is not turned off for the auxiliary module. By default, propagation is enabled, so unless you've explicitly disabled it somewhere else in your code, it should work as intended.\n\n- **Logger Name**: Using `__name__` is a good practice as it helps in identifying which module the log messages are coming from, thanks to the hierarchical structure of loggers.\n\nWith these changes, you should be able to see logging messages from both `main_module` and `auxiliary_module`."
