If this is not the case, it raises an error. However, my Python 2.7 seems to be functioning differently. When I input the following commands:\n\n```python\n>>> bytes([1,2,3])\n'[1, 2, 3]'\n>>> bytes([280])\n'[280]'\n>>> bytes is str\nTrue\n>>> bytes\n<type 'str'>\n```\n\nIt shows that bytes is of type str. This is contrary to what is stated in PEP 358. Can anyone explain why the PEP is declared final, but the implementation does not conform?"

        "content": "The confusion you're experiencing is due to the differences between Python 2.x and Python 3.x. PEP 358 introduced the `bytes` type, which is a new built-in type in Python 3.x. In Python 3.x, `bytes` is an immutable sequence of bytes, and it is distinct from the `str` type, which represents Unicode text.\n\nHowever, Python 2.7 does not have a separate `bytes` type. Instead, in Python 2.7, `bytes` is simply an alias for `str`. That's why you're observing:\n\n- `bytes([1,2,3])` results in a string representation of the list, because `bytes` is just `str`.\n- `bytes([280])` does not raise an error in Python 2.7, as `bytes` is not enforcing byte range checks.\n- `bytes is str` evaluates to `True`, confirming that `bytes` is indeed just an alias for `str` in Python 2.7.\n\nIn summary, PEP 358's introduction of the `bytes` type is specific to Python 3.x. Python 2.x does not have this distinction, and that's why you're seeing the behavior you described. If you are working with byte sequences in Python 2.7 and need behavior similar to Python 3's `bytes`, you might want to use the `bytearray` type, which is a mutable sequence of bytes in Python 2.7."
