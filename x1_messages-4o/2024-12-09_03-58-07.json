Currently, my Python package is using two packages (`pckg1` and `pckg2`) that depend on the same package (`pckg3`), but from two different versions. When I attempt to install the dependencies, I get a warning that my dependencies could not be resolved. The suggestion is to use `pip install --skip-lock` which works, but the dependency tree is still unresolved. I would like to override `pckg2`'s requirement and specify `pckg3>=4.1.0`. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "To resolve the package dependency issue you're encountering with `pipenv`, you can manually specify the version of the shared dependency (`pckg3`) that you want to use, thereby overriding the conflicting requirements. Here's a step-by-step guide to do this:\n\n1. **Modify the `Pipfile`:** Specify `pckg3` with the desired version directly in your `Pipfile`. This will tell `pipenv` to prioritize this version when resolving dependencies.\n\n    ```ini\n    [[source]]\n    url = \"https://pypi.org/simple\"\n    verify_ssl = true\n    name = \"pypi\"\n\n    [packages]\n    pckg1 = \"*\"\n    pckg2 = \"*\"\n    pckg3 = \">=4.1.0\"\n\n    [dev-packages]\n\n    [requires]\n    python_version = \"3.x\"\n    ```\n\n2. **Install with `--skip-lock`:** Since you've specified the desired version of `pckg3`, use the `--skip-lock` option to initially install the dependencies. This will bypass the lockfile creation momentarily, allowing you to override the versions.\n\n    ```bash\n    pipenv install --skip-lock\n    ```\n\n3. **Update Lockfile:** Once the desired version of `pckg3` is installed alongside `pckg1` and `pckg2`, you can update your `Pipfile.lock` to include this resolution. This will effectively lock the environment with your specified versions.\n\n    ```bash\n    pipenv lock\n    ```\n\n4. **Verify the Installation:** After locking the dependencies, ensure everything is installed correctly by running:\n\n    ```bash\n    pipenv install\n    ```\n\n5. **Check Dependency Tree:** You can verify if the dependencies are resolved correctly by checking the dependency graph:\n\n    ```bash\n    pipenv graph\n    ```\n\nBy specifying the version of `pckg3` explicitly in the `Pipfile`, you are directing `pipenv` to resolve dependencies in a way that conforms to your specified constraints. This approach should help to resolve the version conflict between `pckg1` and `pckg2` regarding `pckg3`."
