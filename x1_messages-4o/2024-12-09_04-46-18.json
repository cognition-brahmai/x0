I have a large training dataset and I don't want to loop through the entire trained vectorizer as it may not be efficient. Currently, my code finds the cosine similarity of the first vector, not a new query/document. How can I infer the vector of a new document and find the related documents, similar to my current approach?\n\nHere is my current code:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import linear_kernel\ncosine_similarities = linear_kernel(tfidf[0:1], tfidf).flatten()\ncosine_similarities\n# Returns: array([ 1.        ,  0.04405952,  0.11016969, ...,  0.04433602, 0.04457106,  0.03293218])\n\nrelated_docs_indices = cosine_similarities.argsort()[:-5:-1]\nrelated_docs_indices\n# Returns: array([    0,   958, 10576,  3277])\n\ncosine_similarities[related_docs_indices]\n# Returns: array([ 1.        ,  0.54967926,  0.32902194,  0.2825788 ])\n```"

        "content": "To find the cosine similarity between a new document and your trained TF-IDF vectors, you'll need to convert your new document into the same TF-IDF space as your trained data. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Ensure that you have the trained TF-IDF vectorizer**: When you trained your TF-IDF on the dataset, you likely used `TfidfVectorizer` from `sklearn`. You need to have this vectorizer object saved or accessible to transform new documents.\n\n2. **Transform the new document**: Use the `transform` method of your trained `TfidfVectorizer` to convert the new document into the TF-IDF space.\n\n3. **Calculate cosine similarity**: Use `linear_kernel` to compute cosine similarity between the transformed new document vector and the existing TF-IDF matrix.\n\nHere's a step-by-step code example:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import linear_kernel\n\n# Assuming `tfidf_vectorizer` is your trained TfidfVectorizer\n# and `tfidf_matrix` is the TF-IDF matrix of your training dataset\n\n# Your new document\nnew_document = [\"Your new document text goes here\"]\n\n# Transform the new document to the same TF-IDF space\nnew_tfidf_vector = tfidf_vectorizer.transform(new_document)\n\n# Compute cosine similarity between the new document and the entire TF-IDF matrix\ncosine_similarities = linear_kernel(new_tfidf_vector, tfidf_matrix).flatten()\n\n# Get indices of top similar documents (excluding the new document itself, if applicable)\nrelated_docs_indices = cosine_similarities.argsort()[:-5:-1]\n\n# Output the indices and their corresponding similarity scores\nprint(\"Indices of similar documents:\", related_docs_indices)\nprint(\"Cosine similarities:\", cosine_similarities[related_docs_indices])\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **TfidfVectorizer**: You need the vectorizer used during training to ensure the same vocabulary and feature space.\n- **Transform**: The `transform` method converts the new document into the TF-IDF vector space.\n- **linear_kernel**: Computes the cosine similarity between the new document's TF-IDF vector and the entire matrix of your dataset.\n- **argsort**: Retrieves indices of the most similar documents. Adjust the slicing to get the number of top results you need.\n\nThis approach is efficient since you're leveraging matrix operations rather than looping through individual vectors."
