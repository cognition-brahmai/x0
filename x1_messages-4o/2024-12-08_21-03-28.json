The function should print the sequence starting from the nth term, where n is a given number. If the nth term is odd, the program should print the sequence in reverse order, while if it is even, it should print the sequence in its regular order. The output should include the original value of n, the Fibonacci sequence, and whether it was printed in reverse or regular order. Additionally, the program should include a formula that checks if the generated sequence is correct for the given value of n."
