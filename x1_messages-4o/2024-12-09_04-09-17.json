For instance, for a 3D array, I would use `slice = myarray[:, :, i]`, and for a 4D array, I would use `myarray[:, :, :, i]`. Is there an efficient way to do this for an array of arbitrary dimensions?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this by using the `numpy` library to dynamically construct the slice for any array of arbitrary dimensions. You can use the `numpy`'s `take` function or construct a tuple of slice objects.\n\nHere's how you can do it using slicing:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef slice_last_dimension(arr, i):\n    # Create a tuple of slices: slice(None) means ':' in slicing\n    # This will create as many ':' as there are dimensions in the array\n    slices = [slice(None)] * (arr.ndim - 1) + [i]\n    return arr[tuple(slices)]\n\n# Example usage\nmyarray = np.random.rand(4, 3, 2, 5)  # A 4D array\ni = 1  # Index you want to slice in the last dimension\nresult = slice_last_dimension(myarray, i)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will work for arrays of any dimension and will extract the `i`-th index from the last dimension, regardless of the array's shape. The key is creating a list of `slice(None)` objects, which corresponds to the colon `:` operator for slicing, and appending the index `i` to specify the slice for the last dimension. Then, you convert this list into a tuple and use it to index into the array."
