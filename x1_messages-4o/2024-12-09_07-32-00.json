        "content": "To use Python's `imaplib` to connect to your Gmail account and retrieve the subject titles and sender names of the top 15 messages from your inbox, you'll need to follow these steps. Keep in mind that you'll require an app-specific password or allow less secure apps if using your main Gmail password is not feasible. Here's a basic implementation:\n\n1. **Enable IMAP in Gmail**: Make sure IMAP is enabled in your Gmail settings. Log into your Gmail account, go to Settings > See all settings > Forwarding and POP/IMAP, and ensure that IMAP is enabled.\n\n2. **Generate an App Password**: For security reasons, you should use an app-specific password instead of your Gmail password. You can generate one by visiting your Google Account settings under Security > App passwords.\n\n3. **Install Required Libraries**: Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip if needed.\n\n4. **Python Script**: Use the following script to connect to Gmail and fetch the required information:\n\n```python\nimport imaplib\nimport email\nfrom email.header import decode_header\n\n# Account credentials\nusername = 'your-email@gmail.com'\npassword = 'your-app-specific-password'\n\n# Connect to the server\nmail = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL('imap.gmail.com')\n\n# Log in to your account\nmail.login(username, password)\n\n# Select the mailbox you want to check\nmail.select('inbox')\n\n# Search for all emails in the inbox\nstatus, messages = mail.search(None, 'ALL')\n\n# Convert the result list to a proper list of email IDs\nemail_ids = messages[0].split()\n\n# Define the number of emails you want to retrieve\nN = 15\n\n# Initialize an empty list to store the email subjects and senders\nemails_info = []\n\n# Fetch the latest N emails\nfor i in range(min(N, len(email_ids))):\n    # Fetch the email by ID\n    res, msg = mail.fetch(email_ids[-(i + 1)], '(RFC822)')\n    \n    for response_part in msg:\n        if isinstance(response_part, tuple):\n            # Parse the email message\n            msg = email.message_from_bytes(response_part[1])\n            \n            # Decode the email subject\n            subject, encoding = decode_header(msg[\"Subject\"])[0]\n            if isinstance(subject, bytes):\n                subject = subject.decode(encoding if encoding else 'utf-8')\n            \n            # Decode the email sender\n            from_ = msg.get(\"From\")\n            \n            # Append the result to the list\n            emails_info.append((subject, from_))\n\n# Print the subjects and senders\nfor idx, (subject, sender) in enumerate(emails_info, start=1):\n    print(f\"Email {idx}: Subject: {subject}, From: {sender}\")\n\n# Close the connection and logout\nmail.close()\nmail.logout()\n```\n\n### Important Notes:\n- **Security**: Using app-specific passwords is recommended for security reasons. Avoid using your main Gmail password directly in scripts.\n- **Less Secure Apps**: Google has restricted access for less secure apps. If you encounter login issues, you may need to enable access for less secure apps in your Google account settings, but this is not recommended for security reasons.\n- **Rate Limits**: Be aware of Gmail's rate limits and ensure your script respects Gmail's usage policies to prevent your account from being temporarily locked.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to connect to your Gmail account and retrieve the subject titles and sender names of your latest 15 messages from your inbox using Python."
