I am particularly interested in a network that can produce a 50 depth vector prediction. I need the cost function to be based on two vectors: `Y`, which is the actual vector of the next word in the series, and `Y_hat`, which is the network's prediction. I've tried using a `cosine distance` cost function, but the network doesn't seem to learn. I've run it for over 10 hours on an AWS P3 and the cost remains around 0.7. Is such a model possible? If so, what cost function should be used? I am using the following code for cosine distance in TensorFlow:\n\n```python\ncosine_distance = tf.losses.cosine_distance(tf.nn.l2_normalize(outputs, 2), tf.nn.l2_normalize(targets, 2), axis=2)\n```\nI am trying to predict a word2vec so during sampling, I could pick the next word based on the closest neighbors of the predicted vector."

        "content": "Training a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to output word embeddings instead of logits can be quite challenging. It seems like you're on the right path by considering cosine similarity as a potential loss function. However, there might be several reasons why your model isn't learning effectively, and we can explore a few strategies to improve it.\n\n### Potential Issues and Solutions:\n\n1. **Cosine Distance Implementation:**\n   Your implementation seems correct, but ensure that the `outputs` and `targets` tensors are of the same shape, normalized properly, and contain the expected values. Double-check that `axis=2` is the appropriate dimension for your data.\n\n2. **Alternative Loss Functions:**\n   If the cosine distance isn't working well, you might try using the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** as a loss function instead. While MSE doesn't inherently account for angular similarity, it can sometimes serve as a simpler approximation that might encourage learning:\n\n   ```python\n   mse_loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(outputs - targets))\n   ```\n\n3. **Adjust Learning Rate:**\n   Sometimes the learning rate might be too high or too low. Experiment with different learning rates. Start with a smaller learning rate such as \\( 0.001 \\) or \\( 0.0001 \\).\n\n4. **Network Architecture:**\n   Ensure that your RNN architecture is suitable for your task. Consider increasing the complexity of your model by adding more layers or increasing the number of units in each layer. You might also explore using **LSTM** or **GRU** cells, which tend to capture dependencies better than vanilla RNNs.\n\n5. **Regularization:**\n   Consider adding dropout layers between your RNN layers to prevent overfitting. Regularization can sometimes help the model generalize better and learn more effectively.\n\n6. **Batch Normalization:**\n   Incorporating batch normalization can help stabilize training and improve convergence rates.\n\n7. **Data Preprocessing:**\n   Ensure your input data is properly preprocessed. The quality and structure of your data can significantly affect your model's ability to learn.\n\n8. **Model Evaluation:**\n   Use a validation set to periodically evaluate your model's performance. This can provide insight into whether your model is overfitting or underfitting.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nImplementing the above strategies should help in fine-tuning your RNN model for predicting word embeddings. It's crucial to iteratively experiment with the hyperparameters and network architecture to find the best configuration for your specific dataset and task. If performance still doesn't improve, consider checking for any anomalies in your data or trying out more advanced architectures like Transformer-based models that might be more suited for complex sequence tasks."
