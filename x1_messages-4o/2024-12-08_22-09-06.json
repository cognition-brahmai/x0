        "content": "The code you've provided is close to what you want but has a couple of issues that need addressing. Specifically, the use of `Set` and the random generation of angles and vertices need slight adjustments to ensure the creation of unique polygons with distinct numbers of sides. Here's a refined version of the code:\n\n```ruby\ndef generate_polygons(num_polygons)\n  polygons = []\n  sides_set = (3..12).to_a.sample(num_polygons) # Ensure unique number of sides\n\n  sides_set.each do |num_sides|\n    polygon = { num_sides: num_sides, vertices: [] }\n    angle_increment = 360.0 / num_sides\n\n    num_sides.times do |i|\n      angle = i * angle_increment * Math::PI / 180  # Convert degrees to radians\n      x = Math.cos(angle) * 100\n      y = Math.sin(angle) * 100\n      vertex = { x: x, y: y }\n      polygon[:vertices] << vertex\n    end\n\n    polygons << polygon\n  end\n\n  polygons\nend\n\npolygons = generate_polygons(6)\npolygons.each do |polygon|\n  puts \"Polygon with #{polygon[:num_sides]} sides:\"\n  polygon[:vertices].each do |vertex|\n    puts \"  (#{'%.2f' % vertex[:x]}, #{'%.2f' % vertex[:y]})\" # Format for readability\n  end\nend\n```\n\n### Key Changes and Explanations:\n1. **Unique Number of Sides**: By using `sample(num_polygons)` on the array `(3..12).to_a`, you ensure that you get a unique set of numbers of sides for each polygon.\n\n2. **Vertex Position Calculation**: Instead of using a random angle for each vertex, an equal angle increment is used between vertices to ensure a regular polygon. This is achieved by dividing 360 degrees by the number of sides and converting that angle to radians.\n\n3. **Formatting for Readability**: The vertex coordinates are formatted for better readability, showing only two decimal places.\n\nThis code will generate 6 unique polygons, each with a different number of sides from 3 to 12, and display their vertices' coordinates."
