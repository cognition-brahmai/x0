These words can be arranged in various directions\u2014horizontally, vertically, diagonally, forwards, or backwards. Word searches can be played alone or with others and are commonly found in newspapers, puzzle books, and online. They're a great way to pass the time and also help improve vocabulary and pattern recognition skills."
