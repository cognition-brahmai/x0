However, I can suggest a transition sentence that you can include in your LaTeX document. Here's an example transition:\n\n```latex\nAlice arrived early to the caf\u00e9. \\textit{Eager to start her day,} she ordered her coffee.\n```\n\nTo include this in a LaTeX document, you would wrap it in a `document` environment, like so:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\nAlice arrived early to the caf\u00e9. \\textit{Eager to start her day,} she ordered her coffee.\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nThis creates a smooth transition between the two sentences by adding a phrase that connects Alice's early arrival with her next action."
