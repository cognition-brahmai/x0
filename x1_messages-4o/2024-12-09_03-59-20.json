Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Make sure the `file.py` is in the same directory** as the script from which you want to import the function, or ensure that the directory containing `file.py` is in your Python path.\n\n2. **Import the function correctly** without including the `.py` extension. Use the following syntax:\n\n   ```python\n   from file import function\n   ```\n\n3. **Call the function** with the required arguments:\n\n   ```python\n   result = function(a, b)\n   ```\n\nHere's an example:\n\nAssume `file.py` contains the following function:\n\n```python\n# file.py\n\ndef function(a, b):\n    return a + b\n```\n\nIn your other Python file, say `main.py`, you can import and use the function like this:\n\n```python\n# main.py\n\nfrom file import function\n\n# Call the function with arguments\nresult = function(5, 10)\nprint(result)  # This will print 15\n```\n\nEnsure that there are no syntax errors in your code and that both `file.py` and `main.py` are in the same directory. If they are in different directories, you'll need to adjust the import statement to reflect the correct path or modify the Python path to include the directory containing `file.py`."
