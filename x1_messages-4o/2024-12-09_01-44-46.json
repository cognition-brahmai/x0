I have seen similar questions like \"gnuplot linecolor variable in matplotlib?\" and \"Matplotlib scatterplot; colour as a function of a third variable\" but the solutions provided do not address my issue. The use of `c=arraywhichspecifiespointcolour` only sets the fill color and not the edge color. This becomes a problem when using `markersymbol='+'` because this marker only has edges and no fill. I need a reliable way to color points by a third variable irrespective of the symbol used. Is there a way to achieve this with Matplotlib's scatter function?"

        "content": "In Matplotlib, when you want to color the markers in a scatter plot based on a third variable, and you specifically need to ensure that the edge color reflects this variable (especially when using marker symbols that only have edges like '+'), you can achieve this by setting both the `c` and `edgecolors` parameters.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Use the `c` parameter** to specify the color based on your third variable. This is typically used for the fill color, but with certain markers, it can also affect the edge color.\n\n2. **Set the `edgecolors` parameter** to `'face'` to ensure that the edge color matches the face color, or specify the array of colors directly.\n\n3. **Ensure that the `linewidths` parameter** is set appropriately to make sure the edges are visible, especially if you're using a marker like '+'.\n\nHere's an example code snippet:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Sample data\nx = np.random.rand(50)\ny = np.random.rand(50)\nz = np.random.rand(50)  # Third variable for coloring\n\n# Scatter plot\nplt.scatter(x, y, c=z, cmap='viridis', edgecolors='face', marker='+', linewidths=2)\n\nplt.colorbar(label='Third Variable')  # Add a color bar to show the scale of the third variable\nplt.xlabel('X-axis')\nplt.ylabel('Y-axis')\nplt.title('Scatter Plot Colored by Third Variable')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `c=z`: Specifies the colors of the points based on the `z` variable.\n- `cmap='viridis'`: Chooses a colormap. You can use any colormap you prefer.\n- `edgecolors='face'`: This ensures that the edge color matches the face color. If you want to use a specific color array for edges, you can directly provide that instead.\n- `marker='+'`: Specifies the marker style.\n- `linewidths=2`: Sets the width of the edge lines to ensure they are visible.\n\nThis should give you a scatter plot where the color of the markers (both fill and edge) reflects the values of the third variable, even when using markers like '+'."
