I have the following string:\n\n```python\ns=r\"\"\"99-my-name-is-John-Smith-6376827-%^-1-2-767980716\"\"\"\n```\n\nI want to extract only the last digits in the string, i.e., `767980716`. I attempted to do this with the following code:\n\n```python\nre.compile(r\"\"\"-(.*?)\"\"\").search(str(s)).group(1)\n```\n\nThis was meant to find the content between `-(.*?)`, starting with a \"-\" and ending at the end of the string. However, this returns nothing. Can anyone guide me towards a solution?"

        "content": "To extract the last sequence of digits from the string using regex, you can use a pattern that looks for digits (`\\d`) at the end of the string. The Python regex `\\d+` will match one or more digits, and the `$` asserts the position at the end of a line. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve that:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ns = r\"\"\"99-my-name-is-John-Smith-6376827-%^-1-2-767980716\"\"\"\n\n# Use regex to find the last sequence of digits before the end of the string\nmatch = re.search(r\"\\d+$\", s)\n\nif match:\n    last_digits = match.group()\n    print(last_digits)\nelse:\n    print(\"No match found.\")\n```\n\nThis will correctly output `767980716`, which is the sequence of digits at the end of your string. The `\\d+$` pattern ensures that it matches the digits preceding the end of the string."
