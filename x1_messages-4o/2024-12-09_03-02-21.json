My dataset is imbalanced, with the following distribution: Class 0 - 14.8%, Class 1 - 35.2%, Class 2 - 27.8%, and Class 3 - 22.2%. I am unsure of how to assign the weights for the DNNClassifier's `weight_column` for each class. Although I am comfortable with the coding part, I am unsure about the specific values I should assign to each class. Can you guide me on this?"

        "content": "In the context of imbalanced datasets, assigning appropriate class weights can help the model pay more attention to the minority classes during training. The idea is to assign higher weights to underrepresented classes and lower weights to overrepresented classes. This way, the model can learn equally well from all classes despite the imbalance.\n\nHere is a common method to calculate class weights:\n\n1. **Inverse Frequency Method**: Assign weights inversely proportional to the class frequencies. This means a class with a smaller proportion gets a larger weight.\n\nGiven your class distribution:\n- Class 0: 14.8%\n- Class 1: 35.2%\n- Class 2: 27.8%\n- Class 3: 22.2%\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of samples in the dataset, denoted as `N`. Then, calculate the number of samples in each class using their respective percentages. Let's assume `N` is the total number of samples.\n\n2. **Weight Calculation**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weight for Class i} = \\frac{N}{\\text{Number of samples in Class i}}\n   \\]\n\nAlternatively, you can normalize these weights so that the average weight is 1, which helps maintain the overall scale of the loss:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Normalized Weight for Class i} = \\frac{\\text{Total number of samples}}{\\text{Number of classes} \\times \\text{Number of samples in Class i}}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Example Calculation**:\n   - Total number of samples, `N` = 100 (assuming for simplicity)\n   - Class 0: 14.8 samples\n   - Class 1: 35.2 samples\n   - Class 2: 27.8 samples\n   - Class 3: 22.2 samples\n\nUsing the normalized weight formula:\n\n   - Weight for Class 0 = \\( \\frac{100}{4 \\times 14.8} \\)\n   - Weight for Class 1 = \\( \\frac{100}{4 \\times 35.2} \\)\n   - Weight for Class 2 = \\( \\frac{100}{4 \\times 27.8} \\)\n   - Weight for Class 3 = \\( \\frac{100}{4 \\times 22.2} \\)\n\nCalculate these values and assign them to the `weight_column` in your `DNNClassifier`.\n\n4. **Practical Implementation**:\n   You can implement this in your TensorFlow code by creating a weight column in your input function that assigns these calculated weights to the respective samples based on their class.\n\nBy using these weights, your model should be more sensitive to the minority classes, potentially improving its performance on an imbalanced dataset."
