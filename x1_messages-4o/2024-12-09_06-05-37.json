        "content": "To extract the last 9 items of a list in Python, you can use negative indexing in your slicing syntax. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nlast_9_items = num_list[-9:]\n```\n\nThis approach works because negative indices in Python count from the end of the list. So, `-9` refers to the ninth item from the end of the list, and the slice `[-9:]` gives you all elements from that point to the end of the list. If your list has fewer than 9 items, this will simply return the entire list."
