However, I would like to freeze the Django version for my project. Given that we do not have a requirements.txt file and exclusively use pipenv, how can I achieve this?\n\nHere's the current Pipfile for reference:\n\n```python\n[[source]]\nurl = \"https://pypi.org/simple\"\nverify_ssl = true\nname = \"pypi\"\n\n[packages]\ndjango = \"*\"\n\n[dev-packages]\nblack = \"*\"\n\n[requires]\npython_version = \"3.6\"\n```"

        "content": "To freeze a specific version of Django using pipenv, you'll need to modify your `Pipfile` to specify the version of Django you want. This can be done by replacing the wildcard `*` with the desired version number. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Determine the Version**: First, decide on the specific version of Django you want to use. For example, if you want to use Django version 3.2.9, you'll specify it in the Pipfile.\n\n2. **Update the Pipfile**: Modify the `Pipfile` to specify the desired version of Django. Here's how your `Pipfile` should look:\n\n    ```toml\n    [[source]]\n    url = \"https://pypi.org/simple\"\n    verify_ssl = true\n    name = \"pypi\"\n\n    [packages]\n    django = \"==3.2.9\"\n\n    [dev-packages]\n    black = \"*\"\n\n    [requires]\n    python_version = \"3.6\"\n    ```\n\n3. **Update Your Environment**: After updating the `Pipfile`, run the following command to update your virtual environment:\n\n    ```bash\n    pipenv update\n    ```\n\n    This command will install the specified version of Django and update the `Pipfile.lock` file accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that your project consistently uses the specific version of Django you've specified, preventing any potential compatibility issues that might arise from automatic updates."
