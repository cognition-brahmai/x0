        "content": "When you SSH into a Linux system, the shell that starts may not be a login shell, and thus it doesn't automatically source the `.bashrc` file. Here's a deeper dive into why this might be happening and how you can resolve it:\n\n### Understanding Shell Types\n\n1. **Login Shell**: This is a shell session where you are prompted to log in. It typically sources the `.bash_profile`, `.bash_login`, or `.profile` files, depending on which one it finds first.\n\n2. **Non-Login Shell**: This is a shell session that doesn't require you to log in interactively. It typically sources the `.bashrc` file.\n\n### SSH Behavior\n\n- When you SSH into a system, you usually start a non-login shell by default. This means that `.bashrc` won't be sourced automatically.\n  \n- However, if you want to ensure that your environment variables in `.bashrc` are loaded, you can make your login shell source `.bashrc`.\n\n### Solutions\n\n1. **Modify `.bash_profile` or `.profile`**:\n   - You can modify your `.bash_profile` or `.profile` to source `.bashrc`. Add the following line to the end of your `.bash_profile` or `.profile` file:\n     ```bash\n     if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then\n         . ~/.bashrc\n     fi\n     ```\n\n2. **Force Bash to be a Login Shell**:\n   - When you SSH, you can force bash to be a login shell by using the `-l` option:\n     ```bash\n     ssh -t user@host \"bash -l\"\n     ```\n\n3. **Use `.bashrc` directly in SSH**:\n   - If you often need the environment from `.bashrc`, you can directly source it in your SSH command:\n     ```bash\n     ssh user@host \"source ~/.bashrc; your_command_here\"\n     ```\n\nBy implementing one of these solutions, you should be able to ensure that your environment variables in `.bashrc` are set when you SSH into your Ubuntu box."
