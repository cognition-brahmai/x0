However, I'm encountering an SSLError because CAS requires SSL validation. I'm not sure what Python requests is asking for. Where should the SSL certificate be located? \n\nThe error message I'm receiving is:\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"./test.py\", line 24, in <module>\n  response = requests.get(url1, headers=headers)\n  File \"build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/requests/api.py\", line 52, in get\n  File \"build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/requests/api.py\", line 40, in request\n  File \"build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/requests/sessions.py\", line 209, in request \n  File \"build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/requests/models.py\", line 624, in send\n  File \"build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/requests/models.py\", line 300, in _build_response\n  File \"build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/requests/models.py\", line 611, in send\nrequests.exceptions.SSLError: [Errno 1] _ssl.c:503: error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed\n```"

        "content": "The error message you're seeing indicates that the Python `requests` library is unable to verify the SSL certificate presented by the server because it cannot find a trusted certificate authority (CA) to validate the certificate against. This is a common issue when dealing with servers that use self-signed certificates or certificates issued by a CA not recognized by the system.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify the Certificate**: Ensure that the server's SSL certificate is correctly installed and not expired. You can do this by accessing the URL in a web browser and checking the certificate details.\n\n2. **Use a CA Bundle**: If the server uses a certificate from a CA not included in the default CA bundle, you can specify an alternative CA bundle file. Download the CA's certificate and save it locally. Then, pass it to the `requests.get()` call using the `verify` parameter:\n\n   ```python\n   response = requests.get(url1, headers=headers, verify='/path/to/ca-bundle.crt')\n   ```\n\n   Replace `'/path/to/ca-bundle.crt'` with the path to your CA bundle file.\n\n3. **Disable SSL Verification (Not Recommended)**: If you're doing this for testing purposes and trust the server, you can disable SSL verification by setting `verify=False`. This is not recommended for production code as it makes the connection susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n   ```python\n   response = requests.get(url1, headers=headers, verify=False)\n   ```\n\n4. **Update CA Certificates**: Ensure your system's CA certificates are up to date. This can often resolve issues if the server's certificate is from a newer CA.\n\n5. **Check Python and Requests Version**: Make sure you are using the latest versions of Python and the `requests` library, as updates may contain fixes for SSL issues.\n\n6. **Network Issues**: Ensure there's no network-level interception (e.g., proxy or firewall) affecting the SSL handshake.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the SSL certificate verification issue and proceed with your script."
