        "content": "In Django templates, you can definitely apply multiple filters to a variable by chaining them with the pipe (`|`) symbol. The code you shared should work in most cases, but there might be a few reasons why you're encountering issues. Let's go through some possibilities and solutions:\n\n1. **Filter Order:** Make sure the order of the filters is correct. In your case, applying `safe` first and then `slice` is generally correct if you want to ensure the HTML content is safe before slicing it. However, try switching the order to see if it resolves the issue:\n   ```django\n   {{ game.description|slice:\"65\"|safe }}\n   ```\n\n2. **Filter Behavior:** The `slice` filter is similar to Python's list slicing. Ensure that the slicing part `\"65\"` correctly represents what you want. If you want the first 65 characters, that should be fine, but if there's any context-specific issue with slicing, ensure `game.description` is a string and has enough length.\n\n3. **Data Type:** Confirm that `game.description` is indeed a string. If it's not, you might want to convert it to a string first. You can do this by using the `stringformat` filter:\n   ```django\n   {{ game.description|stringformat:\"s\"|slice:\"65\"|safe }}\n   ```\n\n4. **Whitespace or HTML Issues:** If `game.description` contains HTML tags or whitespace, they might affect how slicing works. Ensure that the slicing doesn't break any HTML tags which might be rendered improperly.\n\n5. **Debugging:** To better understand what's happening, you can temporarily output the intermediate states in your template:\n   ```django\n   {# Output without safe filter #}\n   {{ game.description|slice:\"65\" }}\n\n   {# Output with safe filter #}\n   {{ game.description|safe }}\n   ```\n\n6. **Custom Template Filter:** If the built-in filters are not meeting your needs, consider writing a custom template filter that combines the functionality you require.\n\n7. **Template Syntax:** Ensure there are no syntax errors elsewhere in your template that might be causing the issue.\n\nIf after trying these suggestions you still face issues, it might be helpful to provide more details about the error or behavior you're experiencing, so I can assist you better."
