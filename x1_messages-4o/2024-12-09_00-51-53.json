        "content": "I'm having an issue where calling a Python lambda expression from C# is not thread-safe. I defined a side-effect-free lambda expression in IronPython and assigned it to a C# delegate. However, when I invoke the delegate simultaneously from multiple threads, I get exceptions of type AccessViolationException, NullReferenceException and FatalEngineExecutionError. The error occurrence is non-deterministic and it mostly takes several million iterations to provoke it, which suggests a race condition. How can I avoid this issue? The exceptions are raised when running the process with x64 (x86 doesn't crash) and outside of the debugger. The test system is a Core I7 (8 threads) on Windows 7, .NET Framework 4.0 and IronPython 2.7.1. Here's the minimal code to produce the error:\n\n```csharp\nvar engine = Python.CreateEngine();\n\ndouble a = 1.0;\ndouble b = 2.0;\n\nwhile (true)\n{\n    Func<double, double, double> calculate = engine.Execute(\"lambda a,b : a+b\");\n\n    System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel.For(0, 1000, _ =>\n    {\n         for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) { calculate(a,b); }\n    });\n\n    Console.Write(\".\");   \n}\n```\n\nThe error message is:\n\n```\nFatalExecutionEngineError was detected\n\nMessage: The runtime has encountered a fatal error. The address of the error was at 0xf807829e, on thread 0x3da0. The error code is 0xc0000005. This error may be a bug in the CLR or in the unsafe or non-verifiable portions of user code. Common sources of this bug include user marshaling errors for COM-interop or PInvoke, which may corrupt the stack.\n```\n\nEven declaring the engine as thread-local, it still crashes after some time:\n\n```csharp\nvar calculate = new ThreadLocal<Func<double, double, double>>(() => Python.CreateEngine().Execute(\"lambda a,b : a+b\"));\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to the thread-safety of the IronPython execution engine when using lambda expressions in a multi-threaded environment. Here are some strategies to address this problem:\n\n1. **Use a Separate ScriptScope for Each Thread:**\n   Instead of sharing the same Python engine across multiple threads, create a new `ScriptScope` for each thread. This ensures that each thread has its own execution context and avoids potential race conditions.\n\n2. **Precompile the Lambda Expression:**\n   Precompile the lambda expression outside of the multi-threaded loop. This approach reduces the overhead of repeatedly compiling the lambda expression and can help prevent race conditions.\n\n3. **Isolate Python Engines per Thread:**\n   Create a separate Python engine for each thread. This will ensure complete isolation of the Python environment for each thread, thus preventing any shared state issues.\n\n4. **Synchronize Access to Shared Resources:**\n   If the Python engine or any other shared resources need to be accessed by multiple threads, consider using synchronization primitives such as locks to ensure thread safety.\n\nHere\u2019s a revised version of your code that incorporates some of these suggestions:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Threading;\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\nusing IronPython.Hosting;\nusing Microsoft.Scripting.Hosting;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        double a = 1.0;\n        double b = 2.0;\n\n        while (true)\n        {\n            // Create a new engine and script scope for each thread\n            Func<double, double, double> calculate = CreateThreadSafeLambda();\n\n            Parallel.For(0, 1000, _ =>\n            {\n                for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)\n                {\n                    calculate(a, b);\n                }\n            });\n\n            Console.Write(\".\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    static Func<double, double, double> CreateThreadSafeLambda()\n    {\n        // Create a new Python engine\n        var engine = Python.CreateEngine();\n\n        // Compile the lambda expression\n        var scope = engine.CreateScope();\n        var source = engine.CreateScriptSourceFromString(\"lambda a, b: a + b\");\n        var compiled = source.Execute<Func<double, double, double>>(scope);\n\n        return compiled;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code snippet ensures that each execution of the lambda expression is isolated to its own Python engine and scope, reducing the risk of race conditions. Note that creating a new engine for each thread can be resource-intensive, so monitor the performance and adjust as necessary based on your specific requirements."
