My goal is to create an .mp4 video of this figure rotating in space, similar to the effect when using plt.show() and manually dragging the viewpoint around. I have found an almost perfect solution which involves manually calling into FFMpeg with a folder of images. However, I want to avoid saving individual frames and prefer to use Matplotlib's built in animation support. Here is the code I found:\n\n```python\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\nax = Axes3D(fig)\nax.scatter(xx,yy,zz, marker='o', s=20, c=\"goldenrod\", alpha=0.6)\nfor ii in xrange(0,360,1):\n    ax.view_init(elev=10., azim=ii)\n    savefig(\"movie\"%ii+\".png\")\n```\nHow can I modify it to achieve the desired effect?"

        "content": "To achieve a rotating effect in a 3D scatter plot using Matplotlib's built-in animation support, you can use the `FuncAnimation` class from the `matplotlib.animation` module. Here's how you can modify your code to create a rotating 3D scatter plot and save it as an `.mp4` video without saving individual frames:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\nfrom matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation, FFMpegWriter\n\n# Create a figure and a 3D Axes\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')\n\n# Sample data\nxx = np.random.rand(100)\nyy = np.random.rand(100)\nzz = np.random.rand(100)\n\n# Create a scatter plot\nscatter = ax.scatter(xx, yy, zz, marker='o', s=20, c=\"goldenrod\", alpha=0.6)\n\n# Function to update the view angle\ndef update(ii):\n    ax.view_init(elev=10., azim=ii)\n    return scatter,\n\n# Create an animation\nani = FuncAnimation(fig, update, frames=np.arange(0, 360, 1), blit=False)\n\n# Save the animation as an mp4 file\n# You need to have ffmpeg installed on your system for this to work\nwriter = FFMpegWriter(fps=30, metadata=dict(artist='Me'), bitrate=1800)\nani.save(\"rotating_scatter.mp4\", writer=writer)\n\nplt.close(fig)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **FuncAnimation:** This class is used to create animations by repeatedly calling a function (`update` in this case) at specified intervals.\n- **update function:** This function updates the azimuth angle of the view to create a rotating effect.\n- **FFMpegWriter:** This writer object is used to save the animation to an mp4 file. Ensure that `ffmpeg` is installed on your system to save the video.\n- **ani.save:** This method saves the animation to a file. You can specify the frame rate and other parameters using the writer.\n\nMake sure to have `ffmpeg` installed on your system to save the animation as an `.mp4` file. You can install it via package managers like `brew` on macOS, `apt` on Linux, or by downloading it from the official website."
