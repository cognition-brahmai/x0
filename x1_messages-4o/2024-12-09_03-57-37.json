I understand that the keys that match between two of the input dictionaries will be overwritten, as a dictionary cannot have duplicate keys."

        "content": "To merge a list of dictionaries into a single dictionary, you can iterate over the list and update a new dictionary with each dictionary in the list. This will handle any key collisions by overwriting the previous value with the new one. Here's a simple way to do it using Python:\n\n```python\nlist_of_dicts = [{'a': 1}, {'b': 2}, {'c': 1}, {'d': 2}]\nmerged_dict = {}\n\nfor d in list_of_dicts:\n    merged_dict.update(d)\n\nprint(merged_dict)\n```\n\nThis will give you the output:\n\n```\n{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 1, 'd': 2}\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use a dictionary comprehension combined with unpacking, which is a more concise way to achieve the same result:\n\n```python\nlist_of_dicts = [{'a': 1}, {'b': 2}, {'c': 1}, {'d': 2}]\nmerged_dict = {k: v for d in list_of_dicts for k, v in d.items()}\n\nprint(merged_dict)\n```\n\nThis will also output:\n\n```\n{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 1, 'd': 2}\n```\n\nBoth methods will handle the merging by overwriting any duplicate keys with the value from the last dictionary containing that key in the list."
