For example, with the list ['cat', 'fish', 'dog'], the result for '012cat' would be 3, and for '0123dog789cat' it would be 4. Is there any elegant Python/regex solution for this that can also identify which substring was found or at least the length of the substring matched?"

        "content": "To efficiently find the index of the first appearance of any of several substrings in a given string, you can use regular expressions with the `re` module in Python. This approach will allow you to find not only the position of the first match but also which substring was matched.\n\nHere's an example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef find_first_substring_index(string, substrings):\n    # Join the substrings into a single regex pattern\n    pattern = '|'.join(re.escape(substring) for substring in substrings)\n    \n    # Use re.search to find the first match\n    match = re.search(pattern, string)\n    \n    if match:\n        return match.start(), match.group()  # Returns the index and the matched substring\n    else:\n        return None, None  # No match found\n\n# Example usage\nsubstrings = ['cat', 'fish', 'dog']\nstring1 = '012cat'\nstring2 = '0123dog789cat'\n\nindex1, matched_substring1 = find_first_substring_index(string1, substrings)\nindex2, matched_substring2 = find_first_substring_index(string2, substrings)\n\nprint(f\"String: '{string1}', First Match Index: {index1}, Substring: '{matched_substring1}'\")\nprint(f\"String: '{string2}', First Match Index: {index2}, Substring: '{matched_substring2}'\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Regex Pattern Construction:** We construct a regex pattern by joining all the substrings with the pipe (`|`) character, which acts as an OR operator in regex. `re.escape()` is used to escape any special characters in the substrings.\n\n2. **Searching for Matches:** We use `re.search()` to find the first occurrence of any of these substrings in the target string.\n\n3. **Result Extraction:** If a match is found, `match.start()` gives the starting index of the match, and `match.group()` returns the matched substring.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the first occurrence of any given substrings and identifies which one was matched, along with its position in the string."
