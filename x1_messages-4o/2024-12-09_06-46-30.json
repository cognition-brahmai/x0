        "content": "I am studying the SARSA-Lambda implementation (SARSA with eligibility traces) and I am having difficulty understanding a particular detail. I understand that all Q(s,a) are updated rather than only the one the agent has chosen for the given time-step. I also understand the E matrix is not reset at the start of each episode. I'm assuming that panel 3 of Figure 7.12 was the end-state of episode 1. Now, at the start of episode 2, if the agent moves north instead of east, and this gives it a reward of -500, wouldn't this also affect all states that were visited in the previous episode? If the idea is to reward those states which have been visited in the current episode, then why isn't the matrix containing all e(s,a) values reset at the beginning of each episode? It seems like with this implementation states that have been visited in the previous episode are 'punished' or 'rewarded' for actions done by the agent in this new episode. Can you explain why this is the case?"

        "content": "In SARSA(\u03bb) with eligibility traces, the mechanism is designed to bridge the gap between Monte Carlo methods (which update values at the end of an episode) and Temporal Difference (TD) methods (which update values after every step). The eligibility traces allow SARSA to update not just the current state-action pair but also those that have been previously visited, and the \u03bb parameter controls the decay of these traces over time.\n\nLet's address your concerns step by step:\n\n1. **Eligibility Traces Not Resetting**: The eligibility traces in SARSA(\u03bb) are not reset at the beginning of each episode because they are meant to propagate the reward information backward to the earlier state-action pairs. However, in on-policy methods like SARSA, the traces typically do reset at the beginning of a new episode to ensure the learning is aligned with the current policy. If the traces aren't being reset in your understanding, it might be due to the specific implementation or configuration you are referring to.\n\n2. **Impact of New Actions on Previous States**: The eligibility traces are designed to decay over time, usually at each step and sometimes at the beginning of each episode. This decay ensures that the influence of past state-action pairs diminishes unless they are revisited. When a new episode starts, and you receive an unexpected negative reward, the eligibility traces ensure that all states that contributed to reaching that negative reward are adjusted. This is a key feature of eligibility traces\u2014they allow the learning algorithm to adjust earlier decisions based on new information, even if those decisions were made in the previous episode.\n\n3. **Rewarding or Punishing Past States**: The reason why states from previous episodes are affected by actions in the current episode is precisely to refine the agent's understanding of the environment. By adjusting the values of previously visited state-action pairs, the agent learns to avoid sequences of actions that lead to negative outcomes or to favor those that lead to positive outcomes. The decay factor \u03bb ensures that the influence of past states diminishes, focusing more on recent sequences.\n\nIn many implementations, eligibility traces are reset at the end of an episode to prevent long-term propagation of influence across episodes. However, some variations or configurations might keep traces across episodes to encourage exploration or for specific problem settings. It's crucial to understand the specific implementation details or settings you are working with, as they might deviate from the standard SARSA(\u03bb) approach.\n\nIn summary, SARSA(\u03bb) with eligibility traces is designed to adjust learning based on both recent and past experiences, balancing immediate reactions with long-term strategy adjustments. This flexibility allows the agent to learn more efficiently in dynamic environments."
