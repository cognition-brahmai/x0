        "content": "In Python, you can easily convert a list into `*args` by using the unpacking operator `*`. This operator allows you to unpack the elements of a list (or any iterable) so that they can be passed as separate positional arguments to a function. Here's how you can do it:\n\nSuppose you have a list of `time_series` objects:\n\n```python\ntime_series_list = [ts1, ts2, ts3, ...]  # Your list of time_series objects\n```\n\nAnd you want to pass these objects to the `Report.__init__` function as `*args`, you can do it like this:\n\n```python\n# Assuming you have already imported the necessary module and class\nfrom scikits.timeseries.lib.reportlib import Report\n\n# Create an instance of Report by unpacking the list\nreport_instance = Report(*time_series_list)\n```\n\nBy using the `*` operator before `time_series_list`, you're effectively unpacking the list so that each element is passed as a separate argument to the `Report.__init__` function. This allows the function to receive each `time_series` object as an individual positional argument, as required."
