However, when I import this library, Python encounters an error due to the presence of '<>' signs in the source file. For instance:\n\n```python\nif (cnum < 1000 and nnum <> 1000 and ntext[-1] <> \"s\":\n    ...\n```\n\nI believe this might be an outdated syntax in Python. Could you please explain what exactly '<>' stands for and suggest a more recent alternative that I can replace it with?"

        "content": "The `<>` operator in Python is an old syntax used for \"not equal to.\" It was supported in Python 2 but was removed in Python 3. In Python 3, the correct operator to use for \"not equal to\" is `!=`.\n\nSo, in your example, you would replace `<>` with `!=` like this:\n\n```python\nif (cnum < 1000 and nnum != 1000 and ntext[-1] != \"s\"):\n    ...\n```\n\nThis change should resolve the syntax error you are encountering when trying to run the library with Python 3.3. Make sure to search and replace all instances of `<>` with `!=` throughout the library's code."
