It seems that I can replace a value with another using df.replace('pre', 'post'), but when I try replacing with 'None', I am getting unexpected results. \n\nHere's what I'm doing:\n\n```python\ndf = DataFrame(['-',3,2,5,1,-5,-1,'-',9])\ndf.replace('-', 0)\n```\n\nThis works perfectly. However, when I try:\n\n```python\ndf.replace('-', None)\n```\n\nI get the following result:\n\n```python\n0\n0   - // this isn't replaced\n1   3\n2   2\n3   5\n4   1\n5  -5\n6  -1\n7  -1 // this is changed to `-1`...\n8   9\n```\n\nWhy am I seeing this behavior? I need 'None' values because I am planning to load this DataFrame into a MySQL database, and it doesn't allow 'NaN' values. I know I could first replace '-' with 'NaN' and then convert 'NaN' to 'None', but I am curious why the DataFrame is behaving this way. For your reference, I am using pandas 0.12.0 dev on Python 2.7 and OS X 10.8."

        "content": "The behavior you're experiencing when replacing with `None` in a pandas DataFrame is due to how pandas handles `None` and `NaN` values. In pandas, `None` is treated as a Python object, whereas `NaN` (Not a Number) is a special floating-point value used to represent missing data. This distinction can lead to some unexpected behavior when using the `replace` method.\n\nIn the specific case you mentioned, using `df.replace('-', None)` does not change the `'-'` values to `None` as expected because `None` is not considered a valid \"replacement\" in the way `NaN` is. Instead, you should explicitly specify the `inplace=True` parameter to modify the DataFrame in place, and use `np.nan` to achieve the desired effect, which can then be converted to `None`. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create the DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(['-', 3, 2, 5, 1, -5, -1, '-', 9])\n\n# Replace '-' with NaN\ndf.replace('-', np.nan, inplace=True)\n\n# Convert NaN to None\ndf = df.where(pd.notnull(df), None)\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThis code will replace the `'-'` with `np.nan`, which pandas recognizes as missing data, and then convert those `NaN` values to `None`. When you then load this DataFrame into a MySQL database, the `None` values will be interpreted as `NULL`.\n\nKeep in mind that the version of pandas you mentioned (0.12.0 dev) is quite old, and upgrading to a more recent version of pandas and Python could provide better functionality and performance."
