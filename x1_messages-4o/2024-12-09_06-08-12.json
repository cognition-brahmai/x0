The maximum element is 55 and it occurs twice, at positions 9 and 12. How can I find the positions of this maximum value in this list?"

Here is a simple Python code snippet to do that:\n\n```python\na = [32, 37, 28, 30, 37, 25, 27, 24, 35, 55, 23, 31, 55, 21, 40, 18, 50, 35, 41, 49, 37, 19, 40, 41, 31]\n\n# Find the maximum value in the list\nmax_value = max(a)\n\n# Find all positions (indices) of the maximum value\npositions = [index for index, value in enumerate(a) if value == max_value]\n\nprint(\"The maximum value occurs at positions:\", positions)\n```\n\nThis code first determines the maximum value in the list using the `max()` function. Then, it uses a list comprehension along with `enumerate()` to find all indices where the value equals the maximum value, storing these indices in the `positions` list. When you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\nThe maximum value occurs at positions: [9, 12]\n```"
