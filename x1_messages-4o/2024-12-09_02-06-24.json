I've noticed that while the lambda value from the best tune is one of the values I specified in the tuneGrid, the lambda values of the final model are completely different.

        "content": "The discrepancies you're observing between the lambda values specified in your `tuneGrid` and those in `model$finalModel$lambda` are due to how the `glmnet` package works internally, which is being utilized by `caret` for training the model.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Tuning with Caret:**\n   - When you use the `caret` package with `glmnet`, it uses the `tuneGrid` to select an optimal lambda value from the grid you provided. This is done by evaluating model performance using cross-validation.\n\n2. **Final Model with glmnet:**\n   - After `caret` has identified the best tuning parameters, it fits a final model using the entire training data. During this step, `glmnet` generates its own sequence of lambda values internally to create a path of solutions. The `lambda` sequence you see in `model$finalModel$lambda` is this internal sequence generated by `glmnet` when fitting the final model.\n   - The `lambdaOpt` is the optimal lambda value derived from your specified `tuneGrid`, and it is indeed used in the final model. However, `glmnet` uses its own default sequence to fit the model, which might not match the sequence you provided in the `tuneGrid`.\n\n### Why the Discrepancy?\n\n- `glmnet` internally generates a sequence of lambda values when fitting the model. This sequence is created to ensure a wide range of regularization, allowing it to explore various levels of penalty.\n- Your specified `lambda.seq` in `tuneGrid` is only used during the tuning process to find the best lambda. It does not constrain the `glmnet` internal lambda sequence used in the final model fitting.\n\n### Verification:\n\n- The `lambdaOpt` being in `model$finalModel$lambda` sequence is not necessary for the model to have been fit with the `lambdaOpt` value. The `lambdaOpt` is used for selecting the coefficients corresponding to that penalty level, but the model fitting process involves exploring a range of penalties.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nIf you need the final model to be fit only with your specified lambda values, you would need to fit the model manually with `glmnet` and specify the lambda sequence explicitly outside of the `caret` framework. However, typically, the approach `caret` uses should suffice for most modeling purposes."
