        "content": "The error you're encountering, `AttributeError: 'AxesSubplot' object has no attribute 'add_axes'`, is due to attempting to use the `add_axes` method on an `AxesSubplot` object. The `add_axes` method is actually a method of the `Figure` object, not an `AxesSubplot`. \n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. Use the `add_axes` method on the `Figure` object instead of the `AxesSubplot` object.\n2. Ensure that the `WCSAxes` is properly integrated into the Matplotlib figure.\n\nHere's a revised version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib.gridspec import GridSpec\nfrom astropy.visualization.wcsaxes import WCSAxes\n\n# Assuming `wcs` is defined elsewhere in your code\n# fig = plt.figure()  # Uncomment this line if `fig` is not already defined\n\ngridspec_layout = GridSpec(3, 3, figure=fig)\npyplot_2 = fig.add_subplot(gridspec_layout[2])\n\n# Add the WCSAxes to the figure instead of the subplot\nax = WCSAxes(fig, [0.1, 0.1, 0.8, 0.8], wcs=wcs)\nfig.add_axes(ax)\n\n# Proceed with your plotting\n```\n\nMake sure that the `fig` object is correctly initialized as a `Figure` object before using `add_axes`. If it's not already defined, uncomment the `fig = plt.figure()` line to create a new figure. Adjust the `[0.1, 0.1, 0.8, 0.8]` list to define the position and size of the `WCSAxes` within the figure as needed.\n\nThis should resolve the `AttributeError` and allow you to correctly add a `WCSAxes` to your plot."
