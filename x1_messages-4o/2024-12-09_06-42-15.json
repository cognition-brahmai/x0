I can authenticate and retrieve a session token and even unit test the methods in my class for the API. However, when I run my code, after updating over 100 records with the metadata I supply, I encounter an SSL Certificate verification error. The error is \"ssl.SSLCertVerificationError: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: self signed certificate in certificate chain (_ssl.c:1045)\". I have tried setting the verify kwarg to false in my request, but the error still persists. What could be causing this and how can I resolve it?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, `ssl.SSLCertVerificationError`, indicates that the SSL certificate chain being used by the server includes a self-signed certificate, which isn't trusted by your system's certificate store. This can sometimes happen when dealing with development or internal servers that use self-signed certificates.\n\nHere are a few strategies you can use to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify=False**: While you mentioned that you've set `verify=False` in your request, it's important to ensure this is applied to all requests and in the correct manner. For example:\n   ```python\n   response = requests.get('https://example.com', verify=False)\n   ```\n   However, using this method is not recommended for production environments as it makes your application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n2. **Custom Certificate Authority (CA) Bundle**: If you have access to the self-signed certificate, you can add it to a custom CA bundle and use that to verify requests. Save the certificate to a `.pem` file and use it like this:\n   ```python\n   response = requests.get('https://example.com', verify='/path/to/custom_ca_bundle.pem')\n   ```\n\n3. **Updating Your System's Trusted Certificates**: If you have administrative control over the system, you can add the self-signed certificate to your system's trusted certificate store. This is more secure than disabling verification entirely.\n\n4. **Environment Variables**: Set the `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` environment variable to point to your custom certificate file:\n   ```bash\n   export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE='/path/to/custom_ca_bundle.pem'\n   ```\n\n5. **Session Object**: If you're using a `requests.Session` object, ensure that you configure it correctly to handle the verification:\n   ```python\n   session = requests.Session()\n   session.verify = '/path/to/custom_ca_bundle.pem'\n   response = session.get('https://example.com')\n   ```\n\n6. **Debugging**: Consider using logging or debugging to ensure that the `verify` parameter is set properly in all of your requests.\n\nIf none of these solutions works, you may want to contact the server administrator to check if the certificate chain is configured correctly, or use a certificate from a trusted certificate authority."
