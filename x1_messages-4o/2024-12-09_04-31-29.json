        "content": "In Geany, you can configure the editor to make tabs visible or convert them to spaces if you prefer to avoid using tabs altogether. Here's how you can do both in Geany on Ubuntu:\n\n### Making Tabs Visible\n\n1. **Open Geany**: Start Geany from your applications menu or by typing `geany` in the terminal.\n\n2. **Go to Preferences**: Click on `Edit` in the menu bar, then select `Preferences`.\n\n3. **Editor Tab**: In the Preferences window, navigate to the `Editor` tab.\n\n4. **Display Section**: Look for the `Display` section within the Editor tab.\n\n5. **Show Whitespace**: Check the box labeled `Show whitespace`. This will make tabs, spaces, and other whitespace characters visible in the editor.\n\n### Avoiding Tabs Altogether (Converting Tabs to Spaces)\n\n1. **Indentation Settings**: In the same `Editor` tab within Preferences, find the `Indentation` section.\n\n2. **Type of Indentation**: Set the `Type of indentation` to `Spaces`. This will use spaces instead of tabs for indentation.\n\n3. **Tab Width**: You can also set the `Width` for spaces (commonly set to 4) to match the number of spaces a tab should represent.\n\n4. **Detect Indentation**: Optionally, enable `Detect indentation` if you want Geany to automatically detect and adjust to the indentation style used in a file.\n\n5. **Save Preferences**: Once you\u2019ve made these changes, click `OK` to save your preferences.\n\nBy following these steps, you can either make tabs visible or switch to using spaces for indentation in Geany, aligning it with your preferences or the coding standards of your project."
