However, when I try to do this with the pytest command, I encounter a \"File not found\" error that I don't understand. The command I'm using is `pytest <filename>.py -almonds`, with the expectation that \"almonds\" will be printed as the name. How can I correctly pass arguments in pytest via the command line? Here is the code snippet I'm working with:\n\n```python\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"name\")\ndef print_name(name):\n    print (\"Displaying name: %s\" % name)\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing stems from a misunderstanding of how `pytest` handles command-line arguments and how to use the `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator. The `pytest` framework is primarily designed for testing Python code and does not directly accept arbitrary command-line arguments to pass into test functions. Instead, it uses the `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator to define parameters in test functions.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to work with `pytest` and pass parameters correctly:\n\n1. **Correct `@pytest.mark.parametrize` Usage**: You need to provide a list of values to the `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator. This is how `pytest` knows what values to pass to your test function.\n\n2. **Run pytest with parameters**: You can define the parameters within the code itself, or use `pytest` fixtures and hooks to modify behavior based on environment variables or configuration files if you want dynamic behavior.\n\nHere's a revised version of your code that uses `@pytest.mark.parametrize` correctly:\n\n```python\nimport pytest\n\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"name\", [\"almonds\"])\ndef test_print_name(name):\n    print(\"Displaying name: %s\" % name)\n```\n\n### Running the Test\nTo execute this test, you just run:\n```bash\npytest <filename>.py\n```\n\n### Dynamic Parameterization\nIf you want to pass a name dynamically rather than hardcoded, you can use `pytest` fixtures, or you can set up a custom command-line option using `pytest` hooks. Here's an example using an environment variable to set the name dynamically:\n\n```python\nimport pytest\nimport os\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef name():\n    return os.getenv(\"NAME\", \"default_name\")\n\ndef test_print_name(name):\n    print(\"Displaying name: %s\" % name)\n```\n\nYou can then run your test like this:\n```bash\nNAME=almonds pytest <filename>.py\n```\n\nThis approach uses environment variables to specify the parameter value, which `pytest` will then use when running the test."
