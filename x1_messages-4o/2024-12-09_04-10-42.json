I am testing the operation on Ubuntu 12.04 with CUDA 5.5 on a GeForce GTX780 (Kepler architecture). After compiling the code with -O3 flag and for CC=3.5, I noticed that coalesced conflict-free atomic operations had the best performance, and operations on the same address had the worst performance. However, I am unable to understand why operations on the same address in shared memory (inside a block) are slower compared to operations on the same address in global memory (common between all threads). Also, why is address restricted atomic on global is performing worse than when all the threads inside the warp perform it on the same address? Can anyone explain these profiling results?"

        "content": "The performance behavior you're observing with atomic operations in CUDA can be attributed to several factors, particularly concerning memory hierarchy and access patterns. Let's break down the reasons for the observed behavior:\n\n1. **Atomic Operations on the Same Address in Shared Memory:**\n   - **Contention and Serialization:** When multiple threads within the same block attempt to perform atomic operations on the same address in shared memory, they contend for the same resource. This results in serialization of those atomic operations, meaning each operation must wait for the previous one to complete before it can proceed. This serialization significantly impacts performance, causing it to be slower than operations on separate addresses.\n   - **Bank Conflicts:** While shared memory is generally faster than global memory, it is divided into banks, and accessing the same address can lead to bank conflicts, which further degrade performance.\n\n2. **Atomic Operations on the Same Address in Global Memory:**\n   - **Larger Latency but More Parallelism:** Global memory operations typically have higher latency compared to shared memory. However, the global memory system is designed to handle more parallel access patterns across different multiprocessors. Therefore, even though operations are serialized when accessing the same address, the hardware can manage these operations more efficiently than shared memory due to better parallelism support.\n   - **Caching and Coalescing:** For global memory, caching mechanisms (like L1 and L2 caches) and memory coalescing can sometimes help alleviate the performance penalty, especially if the same data is repeatedly accessed and fits well into cache lines.\n\n3. **Address Restricted Atomic on Global Memory:**\n   - **Thread Divergence and Serialization:** When threads in a warp perform address-restricted atomic operations on different addresses, it may cause thread divergence, leading to serialized execution of atomic operations. On the other hand, when all threads in a warp target the same address, they are synchronized, reducing thread divergence but increasing contention on that single location.\n   - **Hardware Specific Optimizations:** The CUDA hardware may have optimizations for certain access patterns, especially when all threads in a warp access the same memory location, which could explain why those operations sometimes appear faster than when addressing different locations.\n\nIn summary, the performance of atomic operations is influenced by a mix of contention, memory hierarchy (shared vs. global memory), bank conflicts, and hardware-specific optimizations. To optimize performance, it's important to minimize contention by distributing atomic operations across different addresses whenever possible and to consider the memory access patterns to reduce serialization and contention."
