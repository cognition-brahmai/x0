The page must include the classification of paper towels based on their materials, texture, absorbency, and eco-friendliness. It should incorporate a complex system that takes into account both natural and synthetic components of paper towels. Can you provide me with an HTML code that not only categorizes paper towels but also presents detailed information about each category? I would appreciate it if you could break down the code into multiple steps to make it easier for me to understand."

        "content": "Sure, I can help you design a comprehensive HTML page for categorizing paper towels based on various parameters. We'll break down the code into multiple steps for clarity. The page will include sections for material, texture, absorbency, and eco-friendliness, and will present detailed information about each category.\n\n### Step 1: Basic HTML Structure\n\nFirst, let's set up the basic HTML structure with a title for your page.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Paper Towel Classification</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n            margin: 0;\n            padding: 0;\n            box-sizing: border-box;\n        }\n        header {\n            background-color: #4CAF50;\n            color: white;\n            text-align: center;\n            padding: 1em 0;\n        }\n        main {\n            padding: 20px;\n        }\n        section {\n            margin-bottom: 20px;\n            border: 1px solid #ddd;\n            padding: 15px;\n            border-radius: 5px;\n        }\n        h2 {\n            color: #4CAF50;\n        }\n        ul {\n            list-style-type: none;\n            padding: 0;\n        }\n        li {\n            padding: 5px 0;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <header>\n        <h1>Paper Towel Classification</h1>\n        <p>Categorizing paper towels based on materials, texture, absorbency, and eco-friendliness</p>\n    </header>\n    <main>\n        <!-- Content will be added in the next steps -->\n    </main>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Step 2: Add Material Classification\n\nNext, let's add a section to classify paper towels based on their materials, both natural and synthetic.\n\n```html\n<section>\n    <h2>Material Classification</h2>\n    <ul>\n        <li><strong>Natural Materials:</strong> Bamboo, Cotton, Recycled Paper</li>\n        <li><strong>Synthetic Materials:</strong> Polyester, Polypropylene</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Natural materials are biodegradable and eco-friendly, while synthetic materials may offer enhanced durability.</p>\n</section>\n```\n\n### Step 3: Add Texture Classification\n\nNow, we'll add a section for texture classification.\n\n```html\n<section>\n    <h2>Texture Classification</h2>\n    <ul>\n        <li><strong>Smooth:</strong> Ideal for delicate surfaces</li>\n        <li><strong>Textured:</strong> Provides better scrubbing action</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Textured paper towels are usually more absorbent and effective for cleaning tough stains.</p>\n</section>\n```\n\n### Step 4: Add Absorbency Classification\n\nLet's include a section for absorbency.\n\n```html\n<section>\n    <h2>Absorbency Classification</h2>\n    <ul>\n        <li><strong>Low Absorbency:</strong> Suitable for light cleaning tasks</li>\n        <li><strong>Medium Absorbency:</strong> Good for everyday use</li>\n        <li><strong>High Absorbency:</strong> Best for heavy-duty cleaning</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>High absorbency towels are ideal for soaking up large spills quickly.</p>\n</section>\n```\n\n### Step 5: Add Eco-friendliness Classification\n\nFinally, let's add a section for eco-friendliness.\n\n```html\n<section>\n    <h2>Eco-friendliness Classification</h2>\n    <ul>\n        <li><strong>Biodegradable:</strong> Breaks down naturally</li>\n        <li><strong>Recycled:</strong> Made from recycled materials</li>\n        <li><strong>Non-Biodegradable:</strong> Contains synthetic components</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Choosing biodegradable and recycled paper towels helps reduce environmental impact.</p>\n</section>\n```\n\n### Complete HTML Page\n\nHere's the complete HTML code with all sections included:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Paper Towel Classification</title>\n    <style>\n

      </section>\n    </main>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis code provides a structured layout to categorize paper towels based on different parameters and presents detailed information about each category. You can further customize the design and content as needed."
