Instead, I am receiving a `SystemExit` traceback error. The code and error message are as follows:\n\n```python\nplayer_input = '' # This has to be initialized for the loop\n\nwhile player_input != 0:\n\n    player_input = str(input('Roll or quit (r or q)'))\n\n    if player_input == q: # This will break the loop if the player decides to quit\n\n        print(\"Now let's see if I can beat your score of\", player)\n        break\n\n    if player_input != r:\n\n        print('invalid choice, try again')\n\n    if player_input ==r:\n\n        roll= randint (1,8)\n\n        player +=roll #(+= sign helps to keep track of score)\n\n        print('You rolled is ' + str(roll))\n\n        if roll ==1:\n\n            print('You Lose :)')\n\n            sys.exit\n\n            break\n```\n\nError message:\n```shell\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n line 33, in &lt;module&gt;\n    sys.exit()\nSystemExit\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with `sys.exit()` is that it's not being called correctly in your code. The `sys.exit` function should be followed by parentheses `()` to ensure it's executed. If you omit the parentheses, Python just references the function without actually calling it, which leads to the `SystemExit` traceback error you are seeing.\n\nHere's how you can fix your code:\n\n1. Import the `sys` module at the beginning of your script if you haven't already.\n2. Use `sys.exit()` with parentheses to properly exit the program when `roll == 1`.\n\nHere's the corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom random import randint\n\nplayer_input = ''  # This has to be initialized for the loop\nplayer = 0  # Initialize player score\n\nwhile player_input != '0':\n\n    player_input = str(input('Roll or quit (r or q): '))\n\n    if player_input == 'q':  # This will break the loop if the player decides to quit\n        print(\"Now let's see if I can beat your score of\", player)\n        break\n\n    if player_input != 'r':\n        print('Invalid choice, try again')\n\n    if player_input == 'r':\n        roll = randint(1, 8)\n        player += roll  # (+= sign helps to keep track of score)\n        print('You rolled:', roll)\n\n        if roll == 1:\n            print('You Lose :)')\n            sys.exit()  # Correctly call sys.exit() with parentheses\n\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- Ensure that all conditions check for string values with quotes (e.g., `'r'` and `'q'`).\n- Make sure `sys.exit()` is called with parentheses to properly exit the program.\n- Initialize the `player` score before the loop to keep track of the score correctly.\n- Import the `random` module to use `randint` correctly."
