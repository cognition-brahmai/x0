I am able to compile and run the following C++11 code without errors on Windows7x64 (MSVS2012 + Nsight 2.0 + CUDA5.5):\n\n```cpp\n#include <thrust/device_vector.h>\n\nint main() {\n    thrust::device_vector<int> dv(10);\n    auto iter = dv.begin();\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nHowever, when I try to compile the same code on Linux64 (Debian 7 Wheezey + Nsight Eclipse from CUDA5.5), it throws errors related to explicit type missing and conversion function issues. I tried adding -stdc++11 line in Properties-> Build-> Settings-> Tool Settings-> Build Stages-> Preprocessor options (-Xcompiler), but it resulted in even more errors. The only way I found to avoid errors on Linux-GCC is by using `thrust::device_vector<int>::iterator iter = dv.begin();` instead of auto keyword. However, all C++11 features work perfectly fine on Windows MSVS2012. Can anyone help me resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is likely due to differences in compiler support for C++11 between MSVC and GCC, as well as the way nvcc, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler, interacts with the host compiler. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you resolve the issue on Linux with GCC:\n\n1. **Verify GCC Version**: Ensure that you are using GCC 4.8.2 or later, as this version has reasonable C++11 support. You can check your GCC version by running `g++ --version`.\n\n2. **Set Compiler Flags**: To enable C++11 support in GCC, you need to pass the `-std=c++11` flag to both GCC and nvcc. You can do this by adding the flag to your nvcc command line:\n\n   ```bash\n   nvcc -std=c++11 -Xcompiler -std=c++11 your_code.cu -o your_program\n   ```\n\n   The `-Xcompiler` flag is used to pass options directly to the host compiler (GCC in this case).\n\n3. **Update Thrust**: Check if your version of Thrust is up-to-date. CUDA 5.5 comes with a specific version of Thrust, and newer versions may have better support for C++11 features. If possible, consider updating Thrust separately.\n\n4. **Use Explicit Types**: Since the `auto` keyword is causing issues, using explicit types such as `thrust::device_vector<int>::iterator` is a valid workaround. This is due to some limitations in the interaction between nvcc and older versions of GCC regarding type inference.\n\n5. **Check for Compatibility Issues**: There might be compatibility issues between CUDA 5.5, your version of Thrust, and GCC. Make sure that your environment is set up correctly and that all components are compatible with each other.\n\n6. **Consider Upgrading**: If possible, consider upgrading to a newer version of CUDA and a more recent version of GCC. Newer versions have better support for C++11 and may resolve these issues more seamlessly.\n\n7. **Review Build Settings**: Double-check your build settings in the Nsight Eclipse environment to ensure that the `-std=c++11` flag is correctly applied and there are no conflicting settings.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issues with using C++11 features in your `.cu` files on Linux with GCC. If problems persist, consult the documentation for the specific versions of CUDA, GCC, and Thrust you are using for any known issues or additional configuration requirements."
