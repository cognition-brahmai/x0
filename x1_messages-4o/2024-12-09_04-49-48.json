Specifically, I want to get all the script tags in a document and then process each one based on the presence (or absence) of certain attributes. For example, for each script tag, if the 'for' attribute is present I want to do something. If the 'bar' attribute is present, I want to do something else. Currently, I am using the following code:\n\n```python\noutputDoc = BeautifulSoup(''.join(output))\nscriptTags = outputDoc.findAll('script', attrs = {'for' : True})\n```\n\nHowever, with this approach, I am only filtering all the script tags which have the 'for' attribute and losing the other ones (those without the 'for' attribute). How can I modify my approach to retain all script tags and process them based on their attributes?"

        "content": "To process all `<script>` tags and handle them based on the presence or absence of certain attributes, you can iterate over all the script tags and use Python's standard approach to check for the presence of attributes in each tag. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n# Assuming 'output' is your HTML content as a string\noutputDoc = BeautifulSoup(''.join(output), 'html.parser')\n\n# Find all script tags\nscriptTags = outputDoc.find_all('script')\n\n# Iterate over each script tag\nfor script in scriptTags:\n    if 'for' in script.attrs:\n        # Do something if 'for' attribute is present\n        print(f\"'for' attribute is present in: {script}\")\n    if 'bar' in script.attrs:\n        # Do something else if 'bar' attribute is present\n        print(f\"'bar' attribute is present in: {script}\")\n    if 'for' not in script.attrs and 'bar' not in script.attrs:\n        # Do something if neither 'for' nor 'bar' attributes are present\n        print(f\"No 'for' or 'bar' attributes in: {script}\")\n\n# Continue processing as needed\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Use `BeautifulSoup` to parse your HTML content.\n\n2. **Find All Script Tags**: Use `find_all('script')` to get all the `<script>` tags in the document, irrespective of their attributes.\n\n3. **Iterate and Check Attributes**: Loop through each script tag, and use the `in` keyword to check for the presence of specific attributes (e.g., `'for'` and `'bar'`).\n\n4. **Conditional Logic**: Implement the desired logic for each case:\n   - If the 'for' attribute is present, execute a specific block of code.\n   - If the 'bar' attribute is present, execute another block of code.\n   - If neither attribute is present, handle accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that you process all script tags and apply the necessary logic based on attribute presence."
