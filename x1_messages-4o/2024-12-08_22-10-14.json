Here's a concept for a puzzle series with multiple layers and advanced features:\n\n---\n\n### Puzzle Series: Project Management Mastery\n\n#### Puzzle 1: Task Delegation Dilemma\n- **Objective**: Allocate tasks to team members based on their skills, availability, and project priority.\n- **Setup**: \n  - Each player is given a profile of team members with skills, availability, and current workload.\n  - Tasks are color-coded based on priority (e.g., red for urgent, yellow for medium, green for low).\n  - Use a grid where rows represent tasks and columns represent team members.\n- **Rules**:\n  - Each task must be assigned to a member with the necessary skill.\n  - Ensure no team member is overloaded.\n  - Consider availability constraints.\n  - Utilize conditional formatting to highlight assignment conflicts.\n- **Challenge**: Successfully delegate all tasks without conflicts.\n\n#### Puzzle 2: Deadline Dynamics\n- **Objective**: Optimize the project timeline to meet all deadlines.\n- **Setup**: \n  - A Gantt chart with tasks, dependencies, and deadlines.\n  - Tasks are linked; changes in one affect others.\n- **Rules**:\n  - Adjust start and end dates while respecting dependencies.\n  - Use conditional formatting to highlight tasks at risk of missing deadlines.\n- **Challenge**: Achieve a timeline where all tasks finish on or before their deadlines.\n\n#### Puzzle 3: Progress Tracking Quandary\n- **Objective**: Accurately track project progress and forecast completion.\n- **Setup**:\n  - A dashboard with progress bars for each task.\n  - Real-time updates based on team reports.\n- **Rules**:\n  - Update progress using color-coded status indicators (e.g., red for behind, yellow for on track, green for ahead).\n  - Forecast completion dates based on current progress.\n- **Challenge**: Provide an accurate project report predicting on-time completion.\n\n#### Puzzle 4: Document Linking Labyrinth\n- **Objective**: Manage and link project documents in a coherent system.\n- **Setup**:\n  - A network diagram with nodes representing documents and edges representing links.\n  - Each document has metadata like author, version, and related tasks.\n- **Rules**:\n  - Ensure all documents are correctly linked to relevant tasks.\n  - Use conditional formatting to identify missing or incorrect links.\n- **Challenge**: Establish a comprehensive and error-free document network.\n\n#### Collaboration and Sharing System\n- **Online Platform**: Use a collaborative tool like Trello, Asana, or a custom digital platform for puzzle solving.\n- **Features**:\n  - Real-time editing and updates for team collaboration.\n  - Sharing options through email, social media, or integrated chat systems.\n  - A leaderboard to encourage friendly competition.\n\n#### Advanced Features\n- **Conditional Formatting**: Highlight errors, conflicts, or achievements in real-time.\n- **Color Coding**: Use consistent color schemes for easy identification of task status, priority, and document links.\n- **Feedback System**: Provide hints or feedback when teams struggle, encouraging continuous learning and improvement.\n\nThese puzzles are designed to be challenging and require teamwork, fostering an environment where players can improve their project management skills through engaging and interactive gameplay."
