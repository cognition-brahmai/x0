I have two lists, y_true and y_prediction as shown below:\n\n```python\ny_true = [1, -1,  0,  0,  1, -1,  1,  0, -1,  0,  1, -1,  1,  0,  0, -1,  0]\ny_prediction = [-1, -1,  1,  0,  0,  0,  0, -1,  1, -1,  1,  1,  0,  0,  1,  1, -1]\n```\nI've computed the confusion matrix using `metrics.confusion_matrix(y_true, y_prediction)`, but this just shifts the problem. I would like to consider the class `-1` as the negatives, while `0` and `1` are variations of positives. How can I compute the true and false positive rates in this situation?"

        "content": "To compute the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) in a multi-class classification problem where one class is considered as the negative class and the others as positives, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the problem into a binary classification problem**: Treat the class `-1` as the negative class and combine the classes `0` and `1` as a single positive class.\n\n2. **Compute the confusion matrix**: For this binary problem, calculate the confusion matrix to get the counts of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.\n\n3. **Calculate TPR and FPR**: Use the confusion matrix to calculate the TPR and FPR.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\n\n# Step 1: Convert the multi-class problem to binary\ny_true_binary = [1 if y != -1 else 0 for y in y_true]\ny_pred_binary = [1 if y != -1 else 0 for y in y_prediction]\n\n# Step 2: Compute the confusion matrix\ntn, fp, fn, tp = confusion_matrix(y_true_binary, y_pred_binary).ravel()\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the true positive rate and false positive rate\n# TPR = TP / (TP + FN)\n# FPR = FP / (FP + TN)\ntpr = tp / (tp + fn)\nfpr = fp / (fp + tn)\n\nprint(f\"True Positive Rate (TPR): {tpr}\")\nprint(f\"False Positive Rate (FPR): {fpr}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **True Positive Rate (TPR)**, also known as recall or sensitivity, is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives. It shows the proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified.\n\n- **False Positive Rate (FPR)** is calculated as the ratio of false positives to the sum of false positives and true negatives. It indicates the proportion of actual negatives that were incorrectly identified as positive.\n\nThis approach effectively treats the classes `0` and `1` as a single \"positive\" class in the binary classification scenario, thus allowing you to compute TPR and FPR as desired."
