Here's a concept you can imagine or create digitally:\n\n---\n\n**Background:**  \nA gradient sky transitioning from a soft, cloudy gray at the top to a bright, cheerful yellow at the bottom, symbolizing the transition from dreary weather to sunshine.\n\n**Central Imagery:**  \n- **Sun:** A stylized sun with bright, radiating beams. The sun could be positioned slightly off-center, allowing its rays to spread across the entire design, symbolizing positivity and warmth.\n- **Silhouette of a Traveler:** In the foreground, a silhouette of a person with an umbrella. The umbrella could be translucent or transparent, allowing the sun's rays to shine through, symbolizing carrying one's own sunshine.\n\n**Typography:**  \n- **Font Style:** Use a mix of handwritten and bold fonts. The handwritten style can capture the personal and positive tone of the quote, while the bold font can emphasize key words like \"sunshine.\"\n- **Placement:** Position the quote in a flowing manner around the sun, perhaps using the sun's rays or the curve of the umbrella to guide the text.\n\n**Color Palette:**  \n- **Yellows and Oranges:** For the sun and rays to convey warmth and positivity.\n- **Soft Grays and Blues:** For the sky and clouds, to represent the weather.\n- **Contrasting Accent Colors:** Like teal or coral, to highlight parts of the design and add vibrancy.\n\nThis design concept encapsulates the spirit of the quote by visually representing the idea of carrying one's own positivity and light, regardless of external circumstances."
