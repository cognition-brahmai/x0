The numpy array looks like this: \n\n```python\n[[41.743617 -87.626839]\n [41.936943 -87.669838]\n [41.962665 -87.65571899999999]]\n```\n\nTo achieve this, I tried using `numpy.around(x, decimals = 2)` and `numpy.round(x, decimals = 2)`. However, I keep encountering an `AttributeError: rint` when using either of these methods. The error is as follows:\n\n```python\nFile \"/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/numpy-1.8.0.dev_3084618_20130514-py2.7-macosx-10.8-intel.egg/numpy/core/fromnumeric.py\", line 2452, in round_\n  return round(decimals, out)\nAttributeError: rint\n```\n\nIs there something I am doing wrong? Is there an efficient way to round numbers in a large numpy array?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, `AttributeError: rint`, suggests there might be an issue with your NumPy installation or the version you're using. The `numpy.round` or `numpy.around` functions should work correctly for rounding elements in a NumPy array. Here's how you can use these functions:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Your original array\narray = np.array([\n    [41.743617, -87.626839],\n    [41.936943, -87.669838],\n    [41.962665, -87.655719]\n])\n\n# Rounding to 2 decimal places\nrounded_array = np.around(array, decimals=2)\n\nprint(rounded_array)\n```\n\nIf you're still encountering the error, here are a few steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check NumPy Version**: Make sure you're using a stable version of NumPy. You can check your current version with:\n   ```python\n   import numpy as np\n   print(np.__version__)\n   ```\n\n2. **Upgrade NumPy**: If you're using an older or development version (as indicated by your error message), consider upgrading to a stable version. You can upgrade using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install numpy --upgrade\n   ```\n\n3. **Check Python Version**: Ensure you're using a compatible Python version. Your error message mentions Python 2.7, which is outdated. It\u2019s recommended to use Python 3.x, as Python 2 is no longer supported.\n\n4. **Reinstall NumPy**: If the issue persists, try reinstalling NumPy:\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall numpy\n   pip install numpy\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully round the numbers in your array."
