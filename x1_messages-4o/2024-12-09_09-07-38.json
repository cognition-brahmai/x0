        "content": "The 0-1 Knapsack problem is a classic problem in computer science and optimization. It can be solved using dynamic programming. Below is a step-by-step guide and Scala code to solve the 0-1 Knapsack problem:\n\n### Problem Statement\nGiven a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.\n\n### Dynamic Programming Approach\nThe idea is to use a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][w]` represents the maximum value that can be attained with a weight less than or equal to `w` using the first `i` items.\n\n### Steps\n1. **Initialize a 2D array `dp`** with dimensions `(n+1) x (W+1)`, where `n` is the number of items and `W` is the maximum weight capacity of the knapsack.\n2. **Set `dp[0][w]` to 0** for all `w`, meaning that with 0 items, the maximum value is 0.\n3. **Iterate over all items** and for each item, iterate over all possible weights from 0 to `W`.\n4. **Update the `dp` array** using the choice to include or exclude the current item.\n\n### Scala Code\nHere's a Scala implementation of the above logic:\n\n```scala\nobject Knapsack {\n\n  def knapsack(weights: Array[Int], values: Array[Int], maxWeight: Int): Int = {\n    val n = weights.length\n    val dp = Array.ofDim[Int](n + 1, maxWeight + 1)\n\n    for (i <- 0 to n) {\n      for (w <- 0 to maxWeight) {\n        if (i == 0 || w == 0) {\n          dp(i)(w) = 0\n        } else if (weights(i - 1) <= w) {\n          val includeItem = values(i - 1) + dp(i - 1)(w - weights(i - 1))\n          val excludeItem = dp(i - 1)(w)\n          dp(i)(w) = Math.max(includeItem, excludeItem)\n        } else {\n          dp(i)(w) = dp(i - 1)(w)\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    dp(n)(maxWeight)\n  }\n\n  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\n    val weights = Array(1, 2, 3, 2)\n    val values = Array(8, 4, 0, 5)\n    val maxWeight = 5\n    val maxValue = knapsack(weights, values, maxWeight)\n    println(s\"The maximum value that can be obtained is: $maxValue\")\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: `dp(0)(w)` is initialized to 0 for all `w`, meaning no items result in zero value.\n- **Main Logic**: For each item `i`, check if it can be included in the knapsack of capacity `w`. If it can, decide whether to include it or not based on the maximum value it can provide.\n- **Result**: The value at `dp(n)(maxWeight)` will be the maximum value that can be obtained with the given weight capacity.\n\nThis code effectively uses dynamic programming to solve the 0-1 Knapsack problem, providing an optimal solution."
