        "content": "In Python, you can overload existing operators by defining special methods in your classes, but you cannot define new operators. Python's syntax and operators are fixed, which means you can't create new operators like '++' or '<<'.\n\nHowever, you can overload existing operators by implementing special methods in your custom classes. For example:\n\n- To overload the '+' operator, you can define the `__add__` method.\n- To overload the '<<' operator, you can define the `__lshift__` method.\n\nHere's a simple example of operator overloading in Python:\n\n```python\nclass MyNumber:\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.value = value\n\n    def __add__(self, other):\n        return MyNumber(self.value + other.value)\n\n    def __lshift__(self, other):\n        return MyNumber(self.value << other.value)\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return str(self.value)\n\n# Usage\nnum1 = MyNumber(10)\nnum2 = MyNumber(5)\n\nresult_add = num1 + num2\nresult_shift = num1 << num2\n\nprint(\"Addition result:\", result_add)  # Output: Addition result: 15\nprint(\"Shift result:\", result_shift)   # Output: Shift result: 320\n```\n\nIn this example, the `MyNumber` class overloads the '+' and '<<' operators. However, you cannot define a new operator like '++' in Python."
