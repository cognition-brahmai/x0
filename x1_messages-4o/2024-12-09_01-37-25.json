The `math.log()` function in Python calculates the natural logarithm (base \\(e\\)) by default. If you want to compute the logarithm with base 10, you should use the `math.log10()` function instead.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nimport math\nprint(math.log10(1.5))\n```\n\nThis will give you the expected result of approximately `0.176091259`."
