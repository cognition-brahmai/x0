Assuming you have a database with a table named `Customer` and it has columns such as `CustomerID`, `CustomerName`, and `CurrentBalance`, here's a basic SQL query you can use to retrieve the information:\n\n```sql\nSELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, CurrentBalance\nFROM Customer;\n```\n\nThis query will select the `CustomerID`, `CustomerName`, and `CurrentBalance` columns from the `Customer` table and list all the customers along with their current balances. \n\nIf you want to generate a more formatted report, you might consider exporting the data to a tool like Microsoft Excel or a reporting tool such as Crystal Reports, JasperReports, or any other similar software, where you can create structured reports with headers, footers, and more.\n\nIn case you need more specific help regarding how to execute this query or export the data, please let me know the database system you're using (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.), and I can provide more detailed guidance."
