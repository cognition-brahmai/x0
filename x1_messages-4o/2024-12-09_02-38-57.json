I made a custom serializers.WritableField and overrode the to_native and from_native methods, but when I update the model using partial=True, all the floats in the JSONField objects are converted into strings. Here's the code I used:\n\n```python\nfrom json_field.fields import JSONEncoder, JSONDecoder\nfrom rest_framework import serializers\n\nclass JSONFieldSerializer(serializers.WritableField):\n    def to_native(self, obj):\n        return json.dumps(obj, cls = JSONEncoder)\n\n    def from_native(self, data):\n        return json.loads(data, cls = JSONDecoder)\n```"

        "content": "When working with Django Rest Framework (DRF) to serialize and deserialize a Django model that includes a JSONField, you generally don't need to create a custom `WritableField`. Instead, DRF provides a `JSONField` serializer that can handle this directly. The issue you're encountering with data types like float being converted to strings is likely due to incorrect handling within your custom field methods.\n\nHere's a more straightforward approach using DRF's built-in `JSONField`:\n\n1. **Ensure you are using Django Rest Framework's `JSONField`:**\n\n   DRF provides a `JSONField` that should work seamlessly with Django's `JSONField`. You just need to define your serializer accordingly. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom rest_framework import serializers\nfrom myapp.models import MyModel  # replace with your actual model\n\nclass MyModelSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):\n    my_json_field = serializers.JSONField()  # Use DRF's JSONField\n\n    class Meta:\n        model = MyModel\n        fields = '__all__'  # or specify fields manually\n```\n\n2. **Handling Partial Updates:**\n\n   When using `partial=True` for updates, make sure that your view or serializer correctly handles the partial data. The built-in `JSONField` should correctly retain the data types, including floats, as long as the input data is valid JSON.\n\n3. **Using the Serializer:**\n\n   When you use this serializer to update your model with `partial=True`, it should maintain the correct data types without converting floats to strings.\n\n4. **Additional Tips:**\n\n   - Ensure that the data passed to the serializer is a valid JSON object. The JSON field serializer expects a dictionary or a list, not a JSON-formatted string.\n   - If you're still facing issues, double-check the version compatibility between Django, Django Rest Framework, and any third-party packages like `json_field` if you're using them.\n\nBy using the built-in `JSONField` serializer, you should be able to avoid the complexities and potential pitfalls of manually encoding and decoding JSON data."
