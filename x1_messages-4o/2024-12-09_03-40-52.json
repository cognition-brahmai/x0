Some of these child classes have similar functions and I'm considering defining these functions externally to reduce redundancy. These functions also call other functions defined in the parent class. To achieve this, I am passing the 'self' object to the external helper functions which in turn call the required function from inside the helper function. This seems to solve my problem but I am unsure if this is a correct or Pythonic approach. Here is my code:\n\n```python\nclass A():\n    def imp_func(*args):\n        # called by the child class functions\n\n\nclass B(A):\n    def common_func(self):\n        # some stuff\n        self.imp_func(*args)\n```\n\nI created a helper function which takes the 'self' object as an argument:\n\n```python\ndef helper_func(obj, some_args):\n    # some common stuff\n    obj.imp_func(*args)\n\nclass B(A):\n    def common_func(self):\n        # unique stuff\n        helper_func(self, some_args)\n```\n\nIs this practice of passing 'self' to an external function appropriate and Pythonic?"

        "content": "Passing the `self` object to an external function is a common and acceptable practice in Python, especially when you want to reduce redundancy and keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). This approach is particularly useful when you have shared logic that needs to operate on instances of classes and you want to avoid duplicating code across multiple child classes.\n\nYour implementation seems fine and is indeed a Pythonic way to handle shared functionality. Here are a few points to consider to ensure that your approach remains clean and maintainable:\n\n1. **Naming and Documentation:** Make sure your helper functions have clear, descriptive names and are well-documented. This will help other developers (and your future self) understand their purpose and usage.\n\n2. **Encapsulation:** Keep in mind the encapsulation principles. Passing `self` around is fine, but ensure that the helper functions only interact with the object's public interface.\n\n3. **Error Handling:** Consider how the helper function will handle cases where `obj` is not of the expected type or doesn't have the expected methods. You might want to include some checks or error handling.\n\n4. **Single Responsibility Principle:** Ensure that the helper function has a single, clear responsibility. If it starts to grow too complex or handle multiple tasks, it might be worth refactoring it further.\n\n5. **Testing:** Make sure you have adequate tests for the helper functions to verify that they behave correctly with the different classes that might use them.\n\nOverall, this approach is both practical and aligned with Pythonic principles, provided you maintain good coding practices throughout your project."
