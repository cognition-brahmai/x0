I tried using the `os.chmod` function in Python to add permissions similar to how Unix `chmod` does but it doesn't seem to work the same way. When I use `os.chmod('somefile', stat.S_IEXEC)`, it changes the file mode to `---x------`, removing all other permissions. How can I add the `u+x` flag while keeping the rest of the modes intact so that the file mode remains `-rw-r--r--`?"

        "content": "To modify the file permissions in Python without altering the existing permissions, you can use the `os.stat` function to retrieve the current file permissions and then apply a bitwise OR operation to add the execute permission. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n1. Use `os.stat` to get the current file mode.\n2. Use `os.chmod` to set the new permissions by adding the execute permission while keeping the existing ones intact.\n\nHere's an example of how you can do this:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport stat\n\ndef add_execute_permission(file_path):\n    # Get the current file permissions\n    current_permissions = os.stat(file_path).st_mode\n    \n    # Add the user execute permission (u+x)\n    new_permissions = current_permissions | stat.S_IXUSR\n    \n    # Set the new permissions\n    os.chmod(file_path, new_permissions)\n\n# Example usage\nfile_path = 'somefile'\nadd_execute_permission(file_path)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `os.stat(file_path).st_mode` retrieves the current file mode.\n- `stat.S_IXUSR` is the constant for the user execute permission.\n- The bitwise OR operation (`|`) is used to add the execute permission without affecting other permissions.\n\nThis approach will maintain the existing permissions and simply add the user execute permission."
