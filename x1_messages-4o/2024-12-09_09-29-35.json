        "content": "Certainly! Below is a simple Java program that demonstrates how to split a list of numbers into odd and even sublists. I'll also explain the code step by step.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class OddEvenSplitter {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Sample list of numbers\n        List<Integer> numbers = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);\n\n        // Create lists to hold odd and even numbers\n        List<Integer> oddNumbers = new ArrayList<>();\n        List<Integer> evenNumbers = new ArrayList<>();\n\n        // Iterate through each number in the list\n        for (int number : numbers) {\n            if (number % 2 == 0) {\n                evenNumbers.add(number); // Add to evenNumbers if the number is even\n            } else {\n                oddNumbers.add(number);  // Add to oddNumbers if the number is odd\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Print the results\n        System.out.println(\"Odd Numbers: \" + oddNumbers);\n        System.out.println(\"Even Numbers: \" + evenNumbers);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Import Necessary Classes:**\n   - We import `ArrayList` and `List` from the `java.util` package. `ArrayList` is used for dynamic arrays that can grow as needed.\n\n2. **Main Method:**\n   - This is the entry point of the program where execution begins.\n\n3. **Sample List:**\n   - We create an immutable list of numbers using `List.of(...)`. This list contains integers from 1 to 10.\n\n4. **Initialize Odd and Even Lists:**\n   - We create two `ArrayList` instances, `oddNumbers` and `evenNumbers`, to store the odd and even numbers separately.\n\n5. **Iterate Through the List:**\n   - We use a for-each loop to iterate through each number in the `numbers` list.\n   - Inside the loop, we use the modulus operator `%` to check if the number is even or odd.\n   - If `number % 2 == 0`, the number is even, and we add it to `evenNumbers`.\n   - Otherwise, the number is odd, and we add it to `oddNumbers`.\n\n6. **Output the Results:**\n   - Finally, we print the odd and even numbers lists to the console.\n\nThis program efficiently categorizes each number into its respective list based on its parity (odd or even) and then outputs the results. You can modify the `numbers` list to test with different sets of numbers."
