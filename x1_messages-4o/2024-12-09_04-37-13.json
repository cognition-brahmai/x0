The 'paraview.simple' library is already installed on my computer, but it is not accessible with pip and there are no .whl files available. The documentation recommends adding the directory containing all the python files to PYTHONPATH. How can I add the relevant folder to PYTHONPATH in my PyCharm session and make it remain there by default, so that the 'paraview.simple' library is still available when I reopen PyCharm?"

This could be a folder within your ParaView installation directory.\n\n### Step 2: Add the Directory to the PYTHONPATH in PyCharm\n\n1. **Open PyCharm** and your project.\n\n2. **Access Project Settings:**\n   - Go to `File` > `Settings` (or `PyCharm` > `Preferences` on macOS).\n\n3. **Navigate to the Project Interpreter:**\n   - In the left pane, go to `Project: <Your Project Name>` > `Python Interpreter`.\n\n4. **Add Content Root:**\n   - Click on the gear icon next to the interpreter dropdown and select `Show All...`.\n   - In the new window, select the interpreter you are using and click on the folder icon at the bottom to add a new path.\n   - Browse to the directory containing the `paraview.simple` code and add it.\n\n5. **Apply Changes:**\n   - Click `OK` to close the interpreter paths window.\n   - Click `Apply` and then `OK` to close the settings window.\n\n### Step 3: Verify PYTHONPATH\nTo ensure that the directory has been added to the PYTHONPATH:\n\n1. Open the terminal within PyCharm or an external terminal.\n\n2. Run the following Python commands:\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   print(sys.path)\n   ```\n\n3. Check if the directory containing `paraview.simple` appears in the output list.\n\n### Step 4: Set Environment Variables (Optional)\nIf you want to ensure the directory is always in the PYTHONPATH regardless of the project settings:\n\n1. **Open Run/Debug Configurations:**\n   - Go to `Run` > `Edit Configurations...`.\n\n2. **Modify Configuration:**\n   - Select your run configuration or create a new one.\n   - In the `Environment Variables` section, add a new variable:\n     - Name: `PYTHONPATH`\n     - Value: The path to the directory containing `paraview.simple`\n\n3. **Save Configuration:**\n   - Click `Apply` and then `OK`.\n\nWith these steps, the specified directory should be added to PYTHONPATH in your PyCharm session and remain there even after reopening PyCharm. You should be able to import `paraview.simple` without any issues."
