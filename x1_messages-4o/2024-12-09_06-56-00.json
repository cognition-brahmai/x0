However, every time I attempt to run the script, it keeps returning an \"ImportError: No module named 'selenium'\" error, even though selenium-2.46.0-py2.7.egg is present in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages. Why is this happening and how can I solve it? Here is the traceback from my code:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Users/GiulioColleluori/Desktop/Class_Checker.py\", line 10, in <module>\n    from selenium import webdriver\nImportError: No module named 'selenium'\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering typically indicates that the Python environment you're using to run the script does not have access to the Selenium module. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Python Version**:\n   - Ensure you are using the correct version of Python when running your script. It looks like you have installed Selenium for Python 2.7, but make sure your script is indeed being executed with Python 2.7. You can check the version by running:\n     ```bash\n     python --version\n     ```\n\n2. **Use pip to Install Selenium**:\n   - It's generally better to use `pip` to manage Python packages. First, make sure `pip` is installed for your Python version. Then, you can install Selenium using:\n     ```bash\n     pip install selenium\n     ```\n   - If you're using Python 3, make sure you're using `pip3`:\n     ```bash\n     pip3 install selenium\n     ```\n\n3. **Virtual Environment**:\n   - Consider using a virtual environment to manage your project dependencies. This helps avoid conflicts between different projects. To create and activate a virtual environment, run:\n     ```bash\n     python -m venv myenv\n     source myenv/bin/activate  # On macOS or Linux\n     ```\n   - Then, install Selenium within this environment:\n     ```bash\n     pip install selenium\n     ```\n\n4. **Check PYTHONPATH**:\n   - Ensure that your `PYTHONPATH` includes the directory where Selenium is installed. You can print it out in your script or terminal to confirm.\n\n5. **Correct Import Statement**:\n   - Double-check your import statement to ensure it is correct:\n     ```python\n     from selenium import webdriver\n     ```\n\n6. **Running the Correct Python**:\n   - Make sure you are running your script with the same Python interpreter that has Selenium installed. Use the full path to the Python interpreter if necessary:\n     ```bash\n     /path/to/python /Users/GiulioColleluori/Desktop/Class_Checker.py\n     ```\n\n7. **Reinstall Selenium**:\n   - If the issue persists, try uninstalling and reinstalling Selenium:\n     ```bash\n     pip uninstall selenium\n     pip install selenium\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"ImportError: No module named 'selenium'\" issue on your OSX system. If you continue to experience difficulties, providing additional context or details about your Python setup would be helpful in troubleshooting further."
