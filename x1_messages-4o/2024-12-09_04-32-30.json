I put together the following test code:\n\n```python\nclass animal(object):\n    \"empty animal class\"\n\nclass dog(animal):\n    \"empty dog class\"\n\nmyDog = dog()\nprint myDog.__class__ is animal\nprint myDog.__class__ is dog\n```\n\nFrom the polymorphism I'm used to (e.g. java's `instanceof`), I would expect both of these statements to print true, as an instance of dog is an animal and also is a dog. However, the output I get is:\n\n```python\nFalse\nTrue\n```\n\nWhat am I misunderstanding about polymorphism in Python?"

        "content": "In Python, the behavior you're observing is due to how the `__class__` attribute works and how type checking is typically done. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **`__class__` Attribute**: The `__class__` attribute of an object in Python refers to the class that the object is an instance of. When you check `myDog.__class__ is animal`, you're asking if the class of `myDog` is exactly `animal`, which it is not\u2014it's `dog`. Therefore, the expression evaluates to `False`.\n\n2. **Type Checking with `isinstance()`**: In Python, to check if an object is an instance of a class or a subclass thereof, you should use the `isinstance()` function. This function checks if the object is an instance of the specified class or any subclass thereof, which is similar to Java's `instanceof`.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use `isinstance()`:\n\n```python\nclass Animal(object):\n    \"empty animal class\"\n\nclass Dog(Animal):\n    \"empty dog class\"\n\nmyDog = Dog()\nprint(isinstance(myDog, Animal))  # True\nprint(isinstance(myDog, Dog))     # True\n```\n\nIn this revised version:\n\n- `isinstance(myDog, Animal)` returns `True` because `Dog` is a subclass of `Animal`, and `myDog` is an instance of `Dog`.\n- `isinstance(myDog, Dog)` returns `True` because `myDog` is directly an instance of `Dog`.\n\nThis approach aligns more closely with the polymorphic behavior you're familiar with from Java."
