I have a static library (*.a) generated using the separable compilation features of CUDA 5.0 that links well with other *.cu files when run through nvcc. However, when I try to link a *.cpp file with the host code in this static library using g++, not nvcc, I get compiler errors like \"undefined reference to __cudaRegisterLinkedBinary\". I am using both `-lcuda` and `-lcudart` and have the libraries in the correct order. I believe there's a step I'm missing. Is there something else I need to do to my static library (device linking?) before I can use it with g++? Also, is it possible to convert the end result into a dynamic library?"

        "content": "Linking host code with a static CUDA library after separable compilation can indeed be a bit tricky, especially when you are trying to link it with a C++ file using `g++` instead of `nvcc`. The issue you are encountering with \"undefined reference to `__cudaRegisterLinkedBinary`\" typically arises because the device code has not been properly linked.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Device Linking**: After generating the static library with separable compilation, you need to perform device linking. This step is essential to resolve any device-side symbols. You can use `nvcc` to accomplish this. For example:\n\n   ```bash\n   nvcc -dlink -o device_link.o -lcudadevrt -lcudart your_static_lib.a\n   ```\n\n   This command generates an object file (`device_link.o`) that contains the necessary device linking information.\n\n2. **Linking with g++**: When you are linking your host code with the static library, you must include the `device_link.o` file you generated in the previous step. The command might look something like this:\n\n   ```bash\n   g++ -o your_executable your_cpp_file.cpp device_link.o -L/path/to/cuda/lib -lcudart -lcuda your_static_lib.a\n   ```\n\n   Make sure that you have specified all necessary CUDA libraries and paths correctly.\n\n3. **Creating a Dynamic Library**: If you want to convert the end result into a dynamic library, you can use `g++` to create a shared library. Here's how you might do it:\n\n   ```bash\n   g++ -shared -o your_dynamic_lib.so your_cpp_file.cpp device_link.o -L/path/to/cuda/lib -lcudart -lcuda your_static_lib.a\n   ```\n\n   Ensure that you have set the `-fPIC` flag when compiling your original object files if they are going to be included in a shared library.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to properly link your static CUDA library with your host code and also convert it into a dynamic library if needed. Remember that the order of the libraries and object files in the command is essential to ensure correct linking."
