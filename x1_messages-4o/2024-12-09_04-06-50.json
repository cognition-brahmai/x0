My code is as follows:\n\n```python\nconn = sqlite3.connect(db_filename)\n\nwith conn:\n    cur = conn.cursor()\n    cur.execute( ... )\n```\nI am aware that the `with` statement auto-commits the changes. However, I am unsure whether it also closes the database connection, as the documentation doesn't specify this. I have checked and found that I can still use `conn` in later statements, suggesting that the connection remains open. Do I need to manually close this connection and what would be the implications of leaving it open?\n\nI've also found that the `with conn` and `with sqlite3.connect(db_filename) as conn` are equivalent, and that `with` does not create a new scope, allowing variables created within it to be accessible outside. My tests confirm that the connection is not closed by the context manager, but rather that `conn.commit()` is executed upon `__exit__`. I am assuming that I should manually close the connection, is this correct?"

        "content": "Yes, you are correct in your understanding. In Python's SQLite, using the `with` statement with a database connection ensures that `conn.commit()` is called automatically upon exiting the `with` block if no exceptions occur. However, it does not close the connection. Therefore, you should manually close the connection when you are done with it to free up resources.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nconn = sqlite3.connect(db_filename)\n\nwith conn:\n    cur = conn.cursor()\n    cur.execute( ... )\n\n# Manually close the connection\nconn.close()\n```\n\nLeaving the database connection open when it is no longer needed can lead to resource leaks, which might eventually exhaust the available connections to the database or cause other performance issues. Closing the connection ensures that all resources tied to the connection are properly released.\n\nAlso, it's a good practice to handle exceptions and ensure that `conn.close()` is always called, even if an error occurs. You can use a try-finally block for this:\n\n```python\nconn = sqlite3.connect(db_filename)\n\ntry:\n    with conn:\n        cur = conn.cursor()\n        cur.execute( ... )\nfinally:\n    conn.close()\n```\n\nThis way, even if an exception is raised during the execution of your statements, the connection will be closed properly."
