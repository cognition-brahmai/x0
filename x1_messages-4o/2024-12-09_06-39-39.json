        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to a mismatch between the egg-link path and the installed location of your package. Essentially, Python's package manager (pip) is confused because it finds the package in two different locations.\n\nHere's how you can fix this issue:\n\n1. **Remove the Existing Egg-Link:**\n   - Locate the egg-link file for the ReviewBoard package. It's typically found in the `site-packages` directory of your virtual environment. The path might look something like `/home/daniel/envs/reviewboard-3.0/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ReviewBoard.egg-link`.\n   - Delete the egg-link file. This will remove the reference to the incorrect location.\n\n2. **Reinstall the Package:**\n   - Navigate to the correct package directory, which is `/home/daniel/reviewboard` in your case.\n   - Reinstall the package in development mode by running:\n     ```bash\n     pip install -e .\n     ```\n   - This command will create a new egg-link pointing to the correct location.\n\n3. **Verify the Installation:**\n   - After reinstalling, verify that the package is correctly pointing to the new location by listing installed packages:\n     ```bash\n     pip list -v\n     ```\n   - Check that the ReviewBoard package points to `/home/daniel/reviewboard`.\n\n4. **Clean Up:**\n   - Make sure there are no other installations or references to ReviewBoard in other directories that might cause confusion.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the AssertionError and ensure that your package is correctly installed and linked."
