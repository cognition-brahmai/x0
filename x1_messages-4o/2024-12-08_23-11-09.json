Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Import SpaCy**: Import the library to utilize its NLP capabilities.\n2. **Load the Language Model**: `nlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")` loads the small English language model, which includes support for named entity recognition.\n3. **Define the Input Text**: The string `text = \"I have a meeting with John in New York on Monday\"` is set as the input text for processing.\n4. **Process the Text**: `doc = nlp(text)` processes the text to create a `Doc` object, which contains the linguistic annotations.\n5. **Extract Named Entities**: The loop `for ent in doc.ents:` iterates over the named entities identified in the text, printing each entity's text and corresponding label.\n\n### Example Output\n\nWhen you run the code with the provided input string, the output highlighting the named entities will be:\n\n```\nJohn PERSON\nNew York GPE\nMonday DATE\n```\n\nHere's a brief explanation of the labels:\n- **PERSON**: Refers to a named person or people (in this case, \"John\").\n- **GPE**: Refers to Geopolitical Entity, which includes countries, cities, states (in this case, \"New York\").\n- **DATE**: Refers to dates or periods (in this case, \"Monday\").\n\nThis example demonstrates how SpaCy can be effectively utilized for entity extraction in natural language processing tasks."
