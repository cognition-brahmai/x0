        "content": "To optimize the utilization of ad-hoc polymorphism in Swift, it's essential to leverage Swift's protocol-oriented programming approach. Ad-hoc polymorphism, often implemented via protocols in Swift, allows for a flexible design by enabling different types to conform to a protocol and provide their own implementations of the protocol requirements. This can help resolve intricate issues by allowing objects to be treated uniformly according to the protocol they conform to.\n\n### Example: Ad-Hoc Polymorphism\n\nLet's consider an example where we need to calculate the area of different geometric shapes. We can define a protocol named `Shape` with a method `area()`.\n\n```swift\nprotocol Shape {\n    func area() -> Double\n}\n\nstruct Circle: Shape {\n    var radius: Double\n    \n    func area() -> Double {\n        return Double.pi * radius * radius\n    }\n}\n\nstruct Rectangle: Shape {\n    var width: Double\n    var height: Double\n    \n    func area() -> Double {\n        return width * height\n    }\n}\n\nstruct Triangle: Shape {\n    var base: Double\n    var height: Double\n    \n    func area() -> Double {\n        return 0.5 * base * height\n    }\n}\n\n// Using ad-hoc polymorphism\nlet shapes: [Shape] = [Circle(radius: 5), Rectangle(width: 4, height: 3), Triangle(base: 3, height: 4)]\n\nfor shape in shapes {\n    print(\"Area: \\(shape.area())\")\n}\n```\n\n#### Time Complexity Analysis\nThe time complexity of accessing the `area()` method for each shape is O(1) since each method performs a constant time computation. The overall complexity for processing all shapes is O(n), where n is the number of shapes.\n\n### Enhancing Adaptability with Parametric Polymorphism\n\nParametric polymorphism can be employed using Swift's generics to enhance program adaptability and flexibility. By using generics, we can write functions and types that work with any type, thus promoting code reusability and type safety.\n\nHere\u2019s a generic function to perform a computation on an array of elements in a multi-threaded environment:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nfunc performComputation<T: Numeric>(_ array: [T], using operation: (T, T) -> T, completion: @escaping (T) -> Void) {\n    DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInitiated).async {\n        let result = array.reduce(0, operation)\n        DispatchQueue.main.async {\n            completion(result)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Usage\nlet intArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nperformComputation(intArray, using: +) { result in\n    print(\"Sum: \\(result)\")\n}\n\nlet doubleArray = [1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5]\nperformComputation(doubleArray, using: *) { result in\n    print(\"Product: \\(result)\")\n}\n```\n\n#### Time Complexity Analysis\nThe time complexity of the `reduce` operation is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. The use of `DispatchQueue` allows the computation to be performed asynchronously, which is suitable for multi-threaded environments, enabling efficient CPU utilization.\n\nBy combining ad-hoc and parametric polymorphism, Swift programs can be designed to be both flexible and efficient, adapting to a wide range of scenarios and requirements in software development."
