        "content": "Certainly! To find the maximum and minimum elements in a list of integers with a time complexity of O(n), you can iterate through the list once, keeping track of the maximum and minimum values encountered so far. This approach ensures that you only pass through the list a single time, achieving the desired time complexity.\n\nHere's a sample implementation in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_max_and_min(numbers):\n    if not numbers:\n        raise ValueError(\"The list is empty.\")\n    \n    # Initialize max and min with the first element of the list\n    max_num = numbers[0]\n    min_num = numbers[0]\n    \n    # Iterate through the list starting from the second element\n    for num in numbers[1:]:\n        if num > max_num:\n            max_num = num\n        if num < min_num:\n            min_num = num\n    \n    return max_num, min_num\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]\nmax_value, min_value = find_max_and_min(numbers)\nprint(f\"Maximum: {max_value}, Minimum: {min_value}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Initialization**: Start by assuming the first element is both the maximum and minimum.\n- **Iteration**: Loop through the list starting from the second element. For each element, compare it to the current maximum and minimum values.\n  - If the current element is greater than the current maximum, update the maximum.\n  - If the current element is smaller than the current minimum, update the minimum.\n- **Return**: After completing the loop, return the maximum and minimum values found.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the maximum and minimum values in a single pass through the list, ensuring an O(n) time complexity."
