Both of them contain some blank spaces. I attempted with the following code:\n\n```python\nfile1 = open('some_file_1.txt', 'r')\nfile2 = open('some_file_2.txt', 'r')\nFO = open('some_output_file.txt', 'w')\n\nfor line1 in file1:\n    for line2 in file2:\n        if line1 == line2:\n            FO.write(\"%s\\n\" %(line1))\n\nFO.close()\nfile1.close()\nfile2.close()\n```\nHowever, this resulted in a lot of blank spaces in my output file. I only want the text parts to be written. \n\nHere is an example of the data in my file1:\n```\nConfig:\nHostname = TUVALU\n\nBT:\nTS_Ball_Update_Threshold = 0.2\n\nBT:\nTS_Player_Search_Radius = 4\n\nBT:\nBall_Template_Update = 0\n```\nAnd here is an example of the data in file2:\n```\nPole_ID      = 2\nWidth        = 1280\nHeight       = 1024\nColor_Mode   = 0\nSensor_Scale = 1\n\nTracking_ROI_Size = 4\nBall_Template_Update = 0\n```\nIf you notice, the last two lines of each file are identical, and I want to write this to my output file. However, with my current approach, it writes the common blank space also. Should I use regex for this problem? I do not have experience with regex."

        "content": "To achieve your goal of comparing two files line by line while ignoring blank spaces, you can modify your code with a few changes. You don't necessarily need to use regex for this task. Instead, you can utilize Python's string methods to strip whitespace from each line before comparing them. Here's a revised version of your code:\n\n```python\ndef compare_files(file1_path, file2_path, output_file_path):\n    with open(file1_path, 'r') as file1, open(file2_path, 'r') as file2, open(output_file_path, 'w') as FO:\n        # Read all lines from both files\n        lines1 = file1.readlines()\n        lines2 = file2.readlines()\n\n        # Use sets to find the common lines after stripping whitespace\n        common_lines = set(line.strip() for line in lines1) & set(line.strip() for line in lines2)\n\n        # Write common lines to the output file\n        for line in common_lines:\n            if line:  # Ensure the line is not empty\n                FO.write(f\"{line}\\n\")\n\n# Specify the paths to your files\nfile1_path = 'some_file_1.txt'\nfile2_path = 'some_file_2.txt'\noutput_file_path = 'some_output_file.txt'\n\ncompare_files(file1_path, file2_path, output_file_path)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Read All Lines**: The `readlines()` method reads all lines from each file into a list.\n2. **Strip Whitespace**: By using `strip()`, you remove leading and trailing whitespace from each line.\n3. **Find Common Lines**: Convert the lists to sets and use the intersection operator `&` to find common lines.\n4. **Write to Output**: Write the common lines to the output file, ensuring you don't write empty lines by checking if `line` is not empty.\n\nThis code should effectively compare the two files, ignoring any blank spaces, and write only the common non-empty lines to the output file."
