        "content": "To multiply two numbers using only bitwise operators, we can use a method similar to the Russian Peasant Multiplication, which relies on bitwise shifts and additions. However, since you cannot use addition directly, you'll have to simulate it using bitwise operations. Here's a Python function to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef bitwise_add(a, b):\n    while b != 0:\n        carry = a & b\n        a = a ^ b\n        b = carry << 1\n    return a\n\ndef bitwise_multiply(x, y):\n    result = 0\n    while y > 0:\n        if y & 1:\n            result = bitwise_add(result, x)\n        x <<= 1\n        y >>= 1\n    return result\n\n# Example usage\nnum1 = 7\nnum2 = 9\nproduct = bitwise_multiply(num1, num2)\nprint(\"Product:\", product)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Bitwise Addition (`bitwise_add` function):** \n   - This function adds two numbers using bitwise operations. \n   - The `carry` is calculated using `a & b`.\n   - The `sum` without carry is calculated using `a ^ b`.\n   - The carry is then shifted left by one position and added to the sum in the next iteration.\n   - This continues until there is no carry left.\n\n2. **Bitwise Multiplication (`bitwise_multiply` function):** \n   - This function multiplies two numbers using the method of repeated addition.\n   - For each bit that is set in `y`, it adds `x` to the result.\n   - `x` is shifted left (multiplied by 2) for each bit position in `y`.\n   - `y` is shifted right (divided by 2) until it becomes zero.\n\nThis code will correctly multiply two numbers using only bitwise operations."
