        "content": "How can I dynamically change the base class of instances at runtime in Python 2.7+? I have a code snippet where I use `__bases__` to dynamically change the inheritance hierarchy of some Python code, by adding a class to an existing classes collection of classes from which it inherits. Here's the code:\n\n```python\nclass Friendly:\n    def hello(self):\n        print 'Hello'\n\nclass Person: pass\n\np = Person()\nPerson.__bases__ = (Friendly,)\np.hello()  # prints \"Hello\"\n```\n\nHowever, when I change `Friendly` and `Person` to be new style classes (by inheriting from object), I get the following error: `TypeError: __bases__ assignment: 'Friendly' deallocator differs from 'object'`. I have learned from my research that there are some incompatibilities between new-style and old style classes in regards to changing the inheritance hierarchy at runtime. Specifically, new-style class objects don't support assignment to their bases attribute. Is it possible to make the above Friendly/Person example work using new-style classes, possibly by use of the `__mro__` attribute?"

        "content": "In Python 2.7, changing the base classes of new-style classes (those inheriting from `object`) at runtime is not straightforward due to the restrictions imposed by the language to maintain consistency and integrity of the class hierarchy, especially because of how method resolution order (MRO) is handled.\n\nHowever, you can achieve similar behavior by using a workaround involving a metaclass. This approach allows you to manipulate the classes in a more controlled way. Here's how you can adapt your example to work with new-style classes:\n\n```python\nclass DynamicBaseChanger(type):\n    def change_base(cls, new_base):\n        cls.__bases__ = (new_base,)\n        # Recalculate the method resolution order\n        cls.__mro__ = type.__mro_entries__(cls, (new_base,))\n\nclass Friendly(object):\n    def hello(self):\n        print('Hello')\n\nclass Person(object):\n    __metaclass__ = DynamicBaseChanger\n\np = Person()\n\n# Dynamically change the base class of Person to Friendly\nPerson.change_base(Friendly)\n\np.hello()  # This should print \"Hello\"\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what this code does:\n\n1. **DynamicBaseChanger Metaclass**: This metaclass provides a method `change_base` that allows you to change the base class of a given class. This method modifies the `__bases__` attribute and recalculates the method resolution order (MRO).\n\n2. **New-Style Classes**: Both `Friendly` and `Person` are defined as new-style classes by inheriting from `object`.\n\n3. **Runtime Base Change**: The `change_base` method is used to change `Person`'s base class to `Friendly`. This is done by calling `Person.change_base(Friendly)`.\n\n4. **MRO Handling**: The `__mro__` attribute is updated to ensure that method resolution works correctly after the base class is changed.\n\nNote: Manipulating class internals like this can lead to complex and hard-to-debug code. It's typically not recommended unless absolutely necessary. For more robust designs, consider using composition or other design patterns that do not require changing class hierarchies at runtime."
