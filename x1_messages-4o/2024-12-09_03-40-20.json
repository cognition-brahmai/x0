While `pip freeze` is a command-line tool, there's a package called `watermark` that is often used within Jupyter notebooks to list versions of Python packages, including those used in the notebook, to help ensure reproducibility. You can use it to display the versions of libraries used in your notebook by using the `%watermark` magic command.\n\nTo use `watermark`, you would first need to install it:\n\n```bash\npip install watermark\n```\n\nThen, within your Jupyter notebook, you can use it like this:\n\n```python\n%load_ext watermark\n%watermark -v -p numpy,pandas,scikit-learn\n```\n\nThis will display the versions of Python, NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn, among others. Adjust the list of packages according to your needs."
