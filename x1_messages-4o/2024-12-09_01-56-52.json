The function, `get_nc_var3d`, takes a file path, a variable, and a year as input parameters. However, when I run this function with the parameters `C:/Users/rit/Documents/PhD/Projects/\\GLA/Input/LUWH/\\LUWLAN_v1.0h\\transit_model.nc`, `range_to_large`, and `1150`, I receive a UserWarning that says \"Persisting input arguments took 0.58s to run. If this happens often in your code, it can cause performance problems (results will be correct in all cases). The reason for this is probably some large input arguments for a wrapped function (e.g. large strings). THIS IS A JOBLIB ISSUE. If you can, kindly provide the joblib's team with an example so that they can fix the problem.\" My input parameters don't seem to be too large, so why am I seeing this warning and how can I prevent it from appearing?"

        "content": "The warning you are seeing is related to how joblib handles the serialization of input arguments when caching function results. Even though your input parameters do not seem large, there are a few things that could be causing this warning:\n\n1. **Complexity of Objects**: If any of your input parameters is an object with a complex structure, it might take time to serialize. This could be the case even with seemingly simple strings if they are part of a larger, more complex data structure.\n\n2. **File Path Length**: The file path you are using is quite long. Although it's just a string, its length might contribute to the serialization time. \n\n3. **File Size**: If the function internally reads a large netCDF file, and if this data somehow gets included in the serialized arguments (e.g., if the file data is being processed and included in the function arguments), it could lead to this warning.\n\n4. **Joblib Version**: There might be specific issues with the version of joblib you are using that could cause this warning. Make sure you have the latest version of joblib, as updates often include performance improvements and bug fixes.\n\n### Possible Solutions:\n\n1. **Ensure Minimal Serialization**: Make sure that the input arguments are as simple and minimal as possible. Avoid passing large or complex objects directly as arguments if they are not necessary for the caching process.\n\n2. **Update Joblib**: Ensure you have the latest version of joblib to benefit from any performance improvements or bug fixes.\n\n3. **Custom Hash Function**: You can define a custom hashing function for the joblib cache to optimize how input arguments are hashed and stored. This might help reduce serialization time.\n\n4. **Pre-process Inputs**: If possible, pre-process your inputs to reduce their size before passing them to the function. For instance, if you are reading a large file, consider extracting only the necessary parts or metadata before using them as inputs.\n\n5. **Contact Joblib Community**: Since the warning suggests this is a joblib issue, you might consider reaching out to the joblib community or checking their GitHub repository for similar issues. Providing an example that reproduces the issue can help them address it in future releases.\n\nImplementing these strategies should help mitigate the warning and improve the performance of your caching process."
