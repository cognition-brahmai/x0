Is it also the standard convention to name the file containing the class in camelCase, particularly if the file only holds the class? For instance, should a class named 'className' be stored in a file named 'className.py' instead of 'class_name.py'?"

        "content": "In Python, the convention for naming classes is indeed to use CamelCase, often referred to as PascalCase. However, when it comes to naming the file that contains the class, the convention is different. Python typically follows the PEP 8 style guide, which recommends using lowercase with underscores for module (file) names.\n\nTherefore, if you have a class named `ClassName`, the conventionally preferred file name would be `class_name.py`. This helps maintain consistency and readability across different Python projects, especially when the file contains more than just the single class, such as additional functions or multiple classes.\n\nHere's a quick summary:\n\n- Class names: `ClassName` (CamelCase)\n- File/module names: `class_name.py` (lowercase with underscores)\n\nFollowing these conventions helps keep your codebase organized and easily understandable by other Python developers."
