Due to the auto-save feature, there's a risk I could accidentally alter the file when reading it if it's not in read-only mode. I tried using `ipython notebook mynb.ipynb --read-only` command, but it doesn't work. Furthermore, it still creates a server, which I do not want in read-only view. Is there any way to open an ipynb file like a HTML file for reading purposes? I'm currently using Linux/Ubuntu."

        "content": "If you want to view IPython notebook files (`*.ipynb`) without launching a server or risking accidental modifications, you can convert them to a static format, like HTML or PDF, using `nbconvert`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Convert to HTML:**\n   You can use the `nbconvert` tool that comes with Jupyter to convert your notebook to HTML. Run the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   jupyter nbconvert --to html mynb.ipynb\n   ```\n\n   This will generate an HTML file (`mynb.html`) in the same directory as your notebook. You can open this file with any web browser to view the notebook content.\n\n2. **Convert to PDF:**\n   If you prefer to have a PDF version, you can convert it using:\n\n   ```bash\n   jupyter nbconvert --to pdf mynb.ipynb\n   ```\n\n   Note that converting to PDF may require additional dependencies like LaTeX.\n\n3. **Terminal Viewer:**\n   If you would like to simply view the notebook content in the terminal without any conversion, you can use the `nbcat` utility. First, install it via pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install nbcat\n   ```\n\n   Then you can view your notebook in the terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   nbcat mynb.ipynb\n   ```\n\nThese methods allow you to view the content of Jupyter notebooks without running a server and ensure that you cannot accidentally modify the original files."
