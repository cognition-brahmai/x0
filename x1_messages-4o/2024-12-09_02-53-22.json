So far, my solution involves printing a text and setting it at the right position by calculating xlim and ylim. However, this approach is prone to errors and the text looks awful if it's different. Is there a more convenient way to set the suplabel or place the text below the frame and center it, without needing to know about the data displayed inside the frame?"

        "content": "To position the suptitles inside the frame in Matplotlib more conveniently, you can use the `suptitle` method in combination with `subplots_adjust` to control the positioning. Here\u2019s a more robust approach that avoids manual calculation of limits and ensures consistent positioning:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Sample data\nx = range(10)\ny = [i**2 for i in x]\n\n# Create figure and axes\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Plot data\nax.plot(x, y)\n\n# Set title for the subplot (inside the frame)\nax.set_title('Plot Title Inside Frame')\n\n# Add a suptitle and adjust its position inside the frame\nplt.suptitle('Main Title Inside Frame', y=0.95, fontsize=16)\n\n# Adjust layout to fit suptitle within the frame\nplt.subplots_adjust(top=0.85)\n\n# Show plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`ax.set_title`:** This sets the title for the subplot itself, which is positioned inside the axes frame.\n\n2. **`plt.suptitle`:** This method is used to add a title for the entire figure. By default, it appears above the plot, but you can adjust its position with the `y` parameter. In this example, setting `y=0.95` positions the suptitle just below the top edge of the figure.\n\n3. **`plt.subplots_adjust`:** Adjusts the subplot parameters to give specified padding. Here, `top=0.85` is used to ensure there's enough space for the suptitle within the frame.\n\nThis approach should help you achieve a consistent and visually appealing placement of titles and suptitles inside the plot frame without needing to manually calculate positions based on the data limits."
