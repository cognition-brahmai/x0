It seems that a channel is missing, and I'm not sure why. Here is the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nimgs = glob.glob('/home/chipin/heart/tray.png')\ncurrent_img = io.imread(imgs[0])\ncv2.imwrite('/home/chipin/heart/01.png', current_img[0:511,0:511])\n```\n\nAnd here are the values of current_img: [Link to image](https://i.stack.imgur.com/abr5h.png)."

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely due to the differences in how OpenCV (cv2) and other libraries like skimage (which is used by `io.imread`) handle images, specifically with respect to color channels.\n\nIn OpenCV, images are typically represented in BGR (Blue, Green, Red) format, whereas most other image processing libraries, such as skimage, use the standard RGB (Red, Green, Blue) format. When you read an image using skimage's `io.imread`, the image is interpreted in RGB format. However, when you save this image using OpenCV's `cv2.imwrite`, it assumes the image is in BGR format and saves it accordingly, which can lead to a color swap.\n\nTo fix this issue, you need to convert the image from RGB to BGR before saving it with OpenCV. You can do this using the `cv2.cvtColor()` function. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport glob\nfrom skimage import io\nimport cv2\n\n# Read the image using skimage\nimgs = glob.glob('/home/chipin/heart/tray.png')\ncurrent_img = io.imread(imgs[0])\n\n# Convert the image from RGB to BGR\ncurrent_img_bgr = cv2.cvtColor(current_img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR)\n\n# Save the image using OpenCV\ncv2.imwrite('/home/chipin/heart/01.png', current_img_bgr[0:511, 0:511])\n```\n\nThis conversion will ensure that the image is saved with the correct color representation, and your blue image should no longer appear yellow after saving."
