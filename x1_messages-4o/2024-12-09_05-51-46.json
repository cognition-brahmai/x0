For instance, if I have a string such as `l = \"one two 3.4 5,6 seven.eight nine,ten\"`, I want to achieve a result where the string is split into `[\"one\", \"two\", \"3.4\", \"5,6\" , \"seven\", \"eight\", \"nine\", \"ten\"]`."

        "content": "To achieve the desired splitting of a string into individual words while preserving numeric formats like \"1,200\" and \"1.2\", you can use Python's regular expression module `re` with a `re.split()` function. The key is to construct a regular expression pattern that splits on spaces, commas, and periods only when they are not part of a number.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef split_string(s):\n    # Define a regular expression pattern\n    # This pattern splits on spaces, commas, and periods only when they are not part of a number\n    pattern = r'(?<!\\d)[,.\\s]+(?!\\d)'\n\n    # Use re.split with the pattern\n    result = re.split(pattern, s)\n\n    # Filter out any empty strings from the result\n    result = list(filter(None, result))\n\n    return result\n\n# Test the function\nl = \"one two 3.4 5,6 seven.eight nine,ten\"\nsplit_result = split_string(l)\nprint(split_result)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the pattern `(?<!\\d)[,.\\s]+(?!\\d)`:\n\n- `(?<!\\d)`: This is a negative lookbehind assertion that ensures the character before the delimiter is not a digit.\n- `[,.\\\\s]+`: This matches one or more of the delimiters: space (`\\\\s`), comma (`,`), or period (`.`).\n- `(?!\\d)`: This is a negative lookahead assertion that ensures the character after the delimiter is not a digit.\n\nThis pattern will effectively split the string by spaces, commas, and periods but will not split within numbers, preserving the numeric formats like \"1,200\" and \"1.2\"."
