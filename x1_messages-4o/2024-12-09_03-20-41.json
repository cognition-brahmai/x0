        "content": "Yes, you can definitely organize your import statements by moving them to a separate Python file and then importing that file into your main script. Here's a way to achieve this:\n\n1. **Create a new Python file** (e.g., `imports.py`). In this file, list all your import statements:\n\n    ```python\n    from somewhere.fileA import ...\n    from somewhere.fileB import ...\n    from somewhere.fileC import ...\n    # and so on\n    ```\n\n2. **Import this file in your main script**. In your main script, you can import everything from `imports.py`:\n\n    ```python\n    from imports import *\n    ```\n\nBy using `from imports import *`, you bring all the imported modules and symbols from `imports.py` into your main script's namespace. However, you should be aware of a few things:\n\n- **Namespace Pollution**: Using `import *` can lead to namespace pollution, which might cause conflicts if there are overlapping names.\n- **Readability**: It might reduce readability since it's not immediately clear where certain functions or classes are coming from.\n- **Static Analysis Tools**: Some tools might not handle `import *` well.\n\nAs an alternative to `import *`, you can explicitly import the necessary modules or functions by name, which offers better clarity and control:\n\n```python\nfrom imports import moduleA, moduleB, functionC\n```\n\nThis method gives you a cleaner main script while maintaining control over your namespace."
