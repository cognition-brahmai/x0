        "content": "In Python, is it possible for a lambda function to have a variable number of arguments? For instance, I am trying to write a metaclass that creates a method for every method in another class. Each newly created method should return the opposite value of the original method and have the same number of arguments. I am attempting to do this with a lambda function, but I am getting errors. How should I pass the arguments? Here is the code I have so far:\n\n```python\nclass Negate(type):\n    def __new__(mcs, name, bases, _dict):\n        extended_dict = _dict.copy()\n        for (k, v) in _dict.items():\n            if hasattr(v, '__call__'):\n                extended_dict[\"not_\" + k] = lambda s, *args, **kw:  not v(s, *args, **kw)\n        return type.__new__(mcs, name, bases, extended_dict)\n\nclass P(metaclass=Negate):\n    def __init__(self, a):\n        self.a = a\n\n    def yes(self):\n        return True\n\n    def maybe(self, you_can_chose):\n        return you_can_chose\n\n# Testing the code:\np = P(0)\nprint(p.yes()) # True\nprint(p.not_yes()) # Error occurred\nprint(p.maybe(True)) # True\nprint(p.not_maybe(True)) # Unexpected output\n```\n\nHowever, I am encountering problems with the results of the code. I got the following error: \n```\nTypeError: __init__() takes exactly 2 positional arguments (1 given)\n```\nAlso, the output of `p.not_maybe(True)` is True, whereas I expected it to be False. Is it possible to correct this?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is related to how lambda functions capture variables in Python. In your current implementation, the lambda function captures the `v` variable by reference, not by value. This means that when the lambda function is eventually called, it uses the last value assigned to `v` in the loop, which is why the behavior is unexpected.\n\nTo solve this, you need to use a technique called \"default argument values\" to capture the current value of `v` during each iteration of the loop. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired behavior:\n\n```python\nclass Negate(type):\n    def __new__(mcs, name, bases, _dict):\n        extended_dict = _dict.copy()\n        for (k, v) in _dict.items():\n            if hasattr(v, '__call__'):\n                extended_dict[\"not_\" + k] = (lambda v: lambda s, *args, **kw: not v(s, *args, **kw))(v)\n        return type.__new__(mcs, name, bases, extended_dict)\n\nclass P(metaclass=Negate):\n    def __init__(self, a):\n        self.a = a\n\n    def yes(self):\n        return True\n\n    def maybe(self, you_can_chose):\n        return you_can_chose\n\n# Testing the code:\np = P(0)\nprint(p.yes()) # True\nprint(p.not_yes()) # False\nprint(p.maybe(True)) # True\nprint(p.not_maybe(True)) # False\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Closure Capture**: By wrapping the lambda function inside another lambda function, you can capture the current value of `v` during each iteration. The outer lambda takes `v` as a parameter, and the inner lambda is the one that gets returned and assigned to `extended_dict`.\n\n2. **Double Lambda**: The outer lambda is immediately invoked with `(v)` to capture the current function `v` as a default argument for the inner lambda. This ensures that each generated `not_*` method retains the correct reference to the original function it is negating.\n\nWith these changes, the negated methods should behave as expected, returning the opposite value of the original method for any given inputs."
