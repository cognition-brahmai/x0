To retrieve all movies released in the year 2020 from the \"MOVIES\" table, you can use the following SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM MOVIES\nWHERE YEAR(release_date) = 2020;\n```\n\nIn this query, it is assumed that there is a column named `release_date` in the \"MOVIES\" table that stores the release date of each movie. If your table schema is different, you might need to adjust the column name accordingly."
