After deploying the necessary files into the Django project and including static files, I tried to refresh my IP. However, I'm encountering an error which states \"DisallowedHost at / Invalid HTTP_HOST header: '198.211.99.20'. You may need to add u'198.211.99.20' to ALLOWED_HOSTS.\" I am new to Django and this is my first website using this framework. I followed this tutorial: https://www.pythonprogramming.net/django-web-server-publish-tutorial/ for setting up my website. Could someone assist me in resolving this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is a common one when deploying a Django application. It occurs because Django has a security setting called `ALLOWED_HOSTS` that specifies which hosts/domains your application can serve. This is to prevent HTTP Host header attacks.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to update the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting in your Django project's `settings.py` file. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Open the `settings.py` file**: This file is usually located in your Django project's main directory, within the folder that contains your `settings.py`.\n\n2. **Locate the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting**: It looks something like this by default:\n   \n   ```python\n   ALLOWED_HOSTS = []\n   ```\n\n3. **Add your server's IP address to `ALLOWED_HOSTS`**: Modify the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` list to include the IP address of your server. In your case, it would look like this:\n\n   ```python\n   ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['198.211.99.20']\n   ```\n\n   If you also have a domain name, you can add it to the list like so:\n\n   ```python\n   ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['198.211.99.20', 'yourdomain.com']\n   ```\n\n4. **Save the changes** and restart your Django application. This may involve restarting your server or your web server (such as Gunicorn or Apache).\n\n5. **Test your application** by accessing it again using your IP address. The error should be resolved now.\n\nAdditionally, if you're planning to deploy your site for production, consider setting up a domain name and using HTTPS for better security. You might also want to look into other Django settings for production, such as `DEBUG=False` and setting up a proper database.\n\nIf you continue to encounter issues, feel free to reach out for further assistance!"
