In a sample DNN tutorial I was working on, this function returned an empty list for my variables, even after successfully cross validating and using the `model.fit()` function to compute the recall scores. The `get_weights()` function also returns empty weights when used on my categorical variables. What could possibly cause this function to return an empty list except when the weights have not been set?"

        "content": "When the `layer.get_weights()` function in Keras returns an empty list, it typically indicates that the layer does not have any trainable weights. Here are a few possible reasons why you might encounter this issue:\n\n1. **Layer Type**: Some layers, such as `Dropout` or `Flatten`, do not have trainable weights. Ensure that you are calling `get_weights()` on layers that are supposed to have weights, like `Dense` or `Conv2D` layers.\n\n2. **Model Not Compiled**: Although you've mentioned successfully using `model.fit()`, it's worth checking that the model was compiled correctly with an optimizer, loss function, and metrics before training.\n\n3. **Custom Layers**: If you're using custom layers, ensure that you have defined them correctly. Custom layers should have weights declared in the `build` method using `self.add_weight`.\n\n4. **Layer Initialization**: Make sure that the layers are properly initialized. If you've applied any custom initialization that might not be setting weights, they may remain unset.\n\n5. **Model Saving and Loading**: If you're loading a model from a file, ensure that the weights were saved correctly and are being loaded into the model.\n\n6. **Shared Layers**: If you're using shared layers across different parts of the model, ensure that the weights are being correctly updated and accessed.\n\nTo diagnose the issue further, you can:\n\n- Print out the model summary using `model.summary()` to verify the architecture and see which layers have weights.\n- Check if the issue persists with a minimal example or a simple model to isolate the problem.\n- Ensure that your data flow through the model is correct and that all layers are connected properly.\n\nIf none of these suggestions resolve the issue, try creating a minimal reproducible example and examining each step to identify where the weights are not being set or updated."
