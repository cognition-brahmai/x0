        "content": "In Python, there isn't a direct equivalent to preprocessor directives like in C or C++. However, you can achieve similar functionality using conditional statements and environment variables. Here's how you can replicate the `#if DEBUG` directive in Python:\n\n1. **Using a Boolean Variable:**\n\n   You can use a simple boolean variable to control the flow of your code:\n\n   ```python\n   DEBUG = True  # Set to False in production\n\n   if DEBUG:\n       # Do some code\n       print(\"Debug mode: Doing some debug-specific code.\")\n   else:\n       # Do some other code\n       print(\"Production mode: Doing some production-specific code.\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Using Environment Variables:**\n\n   Environment variables can be used to toggle debug mode without changing the code:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n\n   DEBUG = os.getenv('DEBUG', 'False').lower() in ('true', '1', 't')\n\n   if DEBUG:\n       # Do some code\n       print(\"Debug mode: Doing some debug-specific code.\")\n   else:\n       # Do some other code\n       print(\"Production mode: Doing some production-specific code.\")\n   ```\n\n   You can set the environment variable `DEBUG` to `True` or `False` using your operating system's environment variable settings.\n\n3. **Using Command-Line Arguments:**\n\n   You can also use command-line arguments to determine which code to execute:\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n\n   DEBUG = '--debug' in sys.argv\n\n   if DEBUG:\n       # Do some code\n       print(\"Debug mode: Doing some debug-specific code.\")\n   else:\n       # Do some other code\n       print(\"Production mode: Doing some production-specific code.\")\n   ```\n\n   You would run your script with `python script.py --debug` for debug mode.\n\nBy using these methods, you can control which parts of your Python code are executed based on a debug condition, similar to how preprocessor directives work in C."
