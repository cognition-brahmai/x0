For instance, if my string is 'ugknbfddgicrmopn', I want the output to be 'dd'. I tried using 're.findall('[a-z]{2}', 'ugknbfddgicrmopn')' but it returns ['ug', 'kn', 'bf', 'dd', 'gi', 'cr', 'mo', 'pn']. I also have a more complex way of getting the expected output using a loop, but I am looking for a simpler solution. If the input is 'abbbcppq', it should only return ['bb', 'pp']. And if it's 'abbbbcppq', it should catch 'bb' twice and return ['bb', 'bb', 'pp']."

        "content": "To find a letter that appears twice consecutively in a string using regular expressions, you can use a capturing group and a backreference. This approach allows you to match any character that repeats consecutively. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef find_consecutive_duplicates(s):\n    # Use a capturing group to match any character and a backreference to match it again\n    matches = re.findall(r'(.)\\1', s)\n    return matches\n\n# Example usage\nstring1 = 'ugknbfddgicrmopn'\nstring2 = 'abbbcppq'\nstring3 = 'abbbbcppq'\n\nprint(find_consecutive_duplicates(string1))  # Output: ['d']\nprint(find_consecutive_duplicates(string2))  # Output: ['b', 'p']\nprint(find_consecutive_duplicates(string3))  # Output: ['b', 'b', 'p']\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The regular expression `(.)\\1` works as follows:\n  - `(.)` is a capturing group that matches any single character and captures it.\n  - `\\1` is a backreference to the first capturing group, meaning it matches the same character that was captured by `(.)`.\n\nThis approach will efficiently return all occurrences of consecutive duplicate letters in the string."
