The traceback shows that the issue arises from the line `address = request.session['address']` in the 'address' function of my 'myapp_extras.py' file. I have referenced a similar issue on stack overflow titled \"In Django, is it possible to access the current user session from within a custom tag?\", but I am still facing this issue."

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that the `request` object is not automatically available in your custom template tag function. To access the request object, you need to pass it explicitly to the template tag. You can achieve this by modifying your template tag to accept the request as a parameter.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Modify your `address` template tag to accept the request object as a parameter:\n\n```python\nfrom django import template\n\nregister = template.Library()\n\n@register.inclusion_tag('new/userinfo.html', takes_context=True)\ndef address(context):\n    request = context['request']\n    address = request.session.get('address', 'Default Address')  # Use a default value if 'address' is not in session\n    return {'address': address}\n```\n\n2. Notice the `takes_context=True` argument in the `register.inclusion_tag` decorator. This allows the function to accept the context from the template, which includes the `request` object.\n\n3. In your template where you use the `address` tag, you don't need to do anything special, because the `takes_context=True` will automatically pass the full template context, including the request, to your tag function.\n\nMake sure your `TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS` includes `'django.template.context_processors.request'` as you have done, so that the request object is available in the template context.\n\nWith these changes, your template tag should be able to access the request object and use it to retrieve the session data."
