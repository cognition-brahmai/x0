I divided my data into test and training sets and printed two different R squared values using the following code:\n\n```python\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn.metrics import r2_score\n\nlineer = LinearRegression()\nlineer.fit(x_train,y_train)\nlineerPredict = lineer.predict(x_test)\n\nscoreLineer = r2_score(y_test, lineerPredict)  # First R-Squared\n\nmodel = sm.OLS(lineerPredict, y_test)\nprint(model.fit().summary()) # Second R-Squared\n```\nMy first R-Squared result is -4.28 and the second R-Squared result is 0.84. I am not sure which R-squared value is correct. Could you explain which one is the right one and why?"

        "content": "In your code, you are calculating R-squared values in two different ways, but they are not directly comparable because they are measuring different things. Let's break down what's happening in each case:\n\n1. **First R-Squared (`scoreLineer`)**:\n   - You are using `r2_score` from `sklearn.metrics` to calculate the R-squared between the true values (`y_test`) and the predicted values (`lineerPredict`).\n   - This R-squared value measures how well your `LinearRegression` model predicts the test data. A negative R-squared value indicates that the model is performing worse than a horizontal line (the mean of `y_test`) would.\n\n2. **Second R-Squared (`model.fit().summary()`)**:\n   - You are using `statsmodels` to fit an OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) model with `lineerPredict` as the independent variable and `y_test` as the dependent variable. \n   - This is not the typical way to use OLS. Normally, you would fit OLS with your original features as independent variables and your actual target as the dependent variable.\n   - The R-squared value obtained here is essentially measuring how well `lineerPredict` can be linearly transformed to match `y_test`. It does not reflect the performance of your original model.\n\n### Which R-squared is correct?\n\n- The **first R-squared value** (`scoreLineer`) is the correct one for evaluating the performance of your `LinearRegression` model on the test data. It directly compares the predictions to the true values.\n\n### Why the discrepancy?\n\n- A negative R-squared in the first case suggests that the model is not fitting the data well, possibly due to a poor model fit, wrong assumptions, or insufficient features.\n- The second R-squared is artificially constructed and doesn't provide meaningful insights about the model's predictive performance on unseen data.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- Focus on improving the model that gave you the first R-squared value. Consider feature engineering, regularization, or trying different algorithms.\n- Ensure your test and train split is done appropriately, and check for issues like data leakage or multicollinearity that might affect model performance."
