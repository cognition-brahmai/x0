        "content": "Certainly! You can create a Python program to read a matrix of any size and print its transpose by using lists. Here's a simple example to guide you through the process:\n\n```python\ndef read_matrix():\n    rows = int(input(\"Enter the number of rows: \"))\n    cols = int(input(\"Enter the number of columns: \"))\n    \n    matrix = []\n    print(\"Enter the matrix row by row:\")\n    for i in range(rows):\n        row = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        if len(row) != cols:\n            raise ValueError(\"Number of elements in the row does not match the number of columns.\")\n        matrix.append(row)\n        \n    return matrix\n\ndef transpose_matrix(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    transpose = []\n    for j in range(cols):\n        transposed_row = []\n        for i in range(rows):\n            transposed_row.append(matrix[i][j])\n        transpose.append(transposed_row)\n        \n    return transpose\n\ndef print_matrix(matrix):\n    for row in matrix:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n\ndef main():\n    matrix = read_matrix()\n    print(\"\\nOriginal Matrix:\")\n    print_matrix(matrix)\n    \n    transposed = transpose_matrix(matrix)\n    print(\"\\nTransposed Matrix:\")\n    print_matrix(transposed)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`read_matrix()`**: This function prompts the user to input the number of rows and columns, and then reads the matrix elements row by row. It ensures that the number of elements entered for each row matches the specified number of columns.\n\n2. **`transpose_matrix(matrix)`**: This function takes a matrix as input and computes its transpose. It iterates over each column index and constructs a new row for the transposed matrix using elements from each row of the original matrix.\n\n3. **`print_matrix(matrix)`**: This utility function prints the matrix in a formatted manner.\n\n4. **`main()`**: This is the main function that orchestrates reading the matrix, computing its transpose, and printing both the original and transposed matrices.\n\n### How to run the program:\n\n- Run the script in a Python environment.\n- Input the number of rows and columns when prompted.\n- Enter each row's elements separated by spaces.\n- The program will print the original matrix and its transpose.\n\nThis program should handle matrices of any size and produce the correct transpose."
