I am looking for a function similar to `str.split(' ')`, but it should be able to handle an unknown number of spaces as separators. Can regular expressions be used to achieve this? Here's an example of what I'm aiming for:\n\n```python\ns = ' 1234    Q-24 2010-11-29         563   abc  a6G47er15        '\nss = s.magic_split()\nprint(ss)  # ['1234', 'Q-24', '2010-11-29', '563', 'abc', 'a6G47er15']\n```"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this by using the `re` module in Python, which provides support for regular expressions. The `re.split()` function can be used to split the string based on one or more spaces. Here's how you can implement the `magic_split` function using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef magic_split(s):\n    # Use re.split with the pattern '\\s+' to split by one or more spaces\n    return re.split(r'\\s+', s.strip())\n\ns = ' 1234    Q-24 2010-11-29         563   abc  a6G47er15        '\nss = magic_split(s)\nprint(ss)  # Output: ['1234', 'Q-24', '2010-11-29', '563', 'abc', 'a6G47er15']\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`r'\\s+'`**: This pattern matches one or more whitespace characters. The `\\s` is a special sequence that matches any whitespace character, such as space, tab, newline, etc. The `+` quantifier ensures that one or more of the preceding element (whitespace in this case) are matched.\n- **`s.strip()`**: This removes any leading and trailing whitespace from the string, which helps in avoiding empty elements at the start or end of the list if the string starts or ends with spaces.\n- **`re.split()`**: Splits the string wherever the pattern matches, effectively treating consecutive whitespace as a single delimiter.\n\nThis approach gives you a robust method to handle strings with varying numbers of spaces between elements."
