        "content": "Yes, Python does support short-circuiting in boolean expressions. Short-circuiting is a programming technique used with logical operators where the second operand is evaluated only if the first operand does not suffice to determine the value of the expression.\n\nIn Python, the `and` and `or` logical operators use short-circuiting:\n\n- **`and` operator**: If the first operand evaluates to `False`, the overall expression will be `False` regardless of the second operand. Therefore, the second operand is not evaluated.\n\n  ```python\n  a = False\n  b = True\n  result = a and b  # b is not evaluated because a is False\n  ```\n\n- **`or` operator**: If the first operand evaluates to `True`, the overall expression will be `True` regardless of the second operand. Therefore, the second operand is not evaluated.\n\n  ```python\n  a = True\n  b = False\n  result = a or b  # b is not evaluated because a is True\n  ```\n\nShort-circuiting can be useful for optimizing performance or preventing errors in expressions where evaluating the second operand may cause an exception if the first operand already determines the result."
