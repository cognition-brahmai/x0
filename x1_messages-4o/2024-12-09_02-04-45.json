        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to a misunderstanding of how to use the `matplotlib` library. The `matplotlib` module itself doesn't have a direct function called `pyplot`. Instead, `pyplot` is a submodule within `matplotlib` that you need to import separately. \n\nTo use `pyplot`, you should first import it explicitly, typically with an alias like `plt`. Here's how you can do it correctly:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Now you can use pyplot functions, for example:\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4]\ny = [10, 20, 25, 30]\n\nplt.plot(x, y)\nplt.xlabel('X-axis label')\nplt.ylabel('Y-axis label')\nplt.title('Sample Plot')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this code snippet:\n\n- `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` imports the `pyplot` module and assigns it the alias `plt`.\n- `plt.plot(x, y)` is used to plot the data points.\n- `plt.xlabel()`, `plt.ylabel()`, and `plt.title()` are used to label the axes and the plot.\n- `plt.show()` is used to display the plot.\n\nMake sure you've installed `matplotlib` correctly using `pip install matplotlib` if it's not already installed. This should solve the error you're encountering."
