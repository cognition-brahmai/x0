However, I encounter an error stating \"nvcc fatal : Value 'sm_20' is not defined for option 'gpu-architecture'\". How can I solve this problem? I am running Ubuntu 16.04 on a GTX 1080ti and have Cuda 9.0 installed. Also, when I try to run `nvcc -V`, I am told that the program 'nvcc' is not installed and I can install it by typing `sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit`. But when I try to install it, it installs the toolkit for Cuda 7.5. How can I install nvcc for the correct version?"

        "content": "To resolve the issues you're facing, you need to ensure that your CUDA setup is correctly configured and that you have the appropriate version matching your GPU and desired CUDA version. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you resolve these problems:\n\n1. **Check CUDA Installation:**\n\n   Since you have CUDA 9.0 installed, you need to make sure it's properly set up. The `nvcc -V` command not working suggests that the PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables might not be set correctly.\n\n2. **Set Environment Variables:**\n\n   Open your terminal and edit your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` depending on your shell) to include the following lines:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-9.0/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}\n   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-9.0/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}\n   ```\n\n   After editing, run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc` to apply the changes.\n\n3. **Verify `nvcc` Installation:**\n\n   After setting the environment variables, check if `nvcc` is available by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   nvcc -V\n   ```\n\n   If it shows the correct version, then the environment is set up properly.\n\n4. **Fix `sm_20` Error:**\n\n   The `sm_20` error suggests that your build configuration is targeting an outdated GPU architecture. For a GTX 1080 Ti (Pascal architecture), you should be targeting `sm_61`. You might need to modify the `CMakeLists.txt` or any build configuration files in the project you're compiling. Look for lines that define `-arch=sm_20` and replace them with `-arch=sm_61`.\n\n5. **Install CUDA from NVIDIA Instead of APT:**\n\n   Since installing through `apt` gives you an older version, download the CUDA 9.0 toolkit directly from the [NVIDIA website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-90-download-archive) and install it manually. Follow the instructions provided for your specific version of Ubuntu.\n\n6. **Rebuild or Reinstall Libraries:**\n\n   After making these changes, try to reinstall any libraries that failed. Use:\n\n   ```bash\n   luarocks install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qassemoquab/stnbhwd/master/stnbhwd-scm-1.rockspec\n   ```\n\n   Ensure that any CMake or Makefile configurations are updated to use the correct `sm` version for your GPU.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve both the `nvcc` path issue and the `sm_20` architecture error. If you run into any more issues, double-check the environment variables and the specific build configurations for your project."
