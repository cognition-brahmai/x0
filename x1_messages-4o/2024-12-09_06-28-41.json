This is a straightforward and efficient way to check for the presence of a substring. \n\nHere's how you can do it with your example:\n\n```python\nsubstring = \"please help me out\"\nstring = \"please help me out so that I could solve this\"\n\n# Check if the substring is in the string\nif substring in string:\n    print(\"The substring exists within the string.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The substring does not exist within the string.\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `in` keyword checks if `substring` is contained within `string`. If it is, the condition evaluates to `True`, and you get the respective output. This method is both simple and efficient for checking substring presence in a string."
