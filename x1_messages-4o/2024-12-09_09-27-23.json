        "content": "Detecting and removing duplicate letters in a string is a task that can be efficiently solved using programming techniques rather than AI, as it involves straightforward string manipulation. Here's a simple approach using Python:\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(input_string):\n    # Create an empty set to store seen characters\n    seen = set()\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n\n    # Iterate over each character in the string\n    for char in input_string:\n        # If the character has not been seen, add it to the result\n        if char not in seen:\n            result.append(char)\n            # Mark the character as seen\n            seen.add(char)\n\n    # Join the list into a string and return\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_string = \"sensai\"\noutput_string = remove_duplicates(input_string)\nprint(output_string)  # Output: \"sensai\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Set Data Structure**: A set is used to track characters that have already been encountered. Sets are efficient for membership tests, i.e., checking if an item is already present.\n- **Result List**: We append characters to a list only if they have not been seen before. This ensures each character appears only once in the final result.\n- **Efficiency**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input string, as each character is processed once.\n\nThis method works well for simple cases of duplicate removal in strings. If you're dealing with more complex scenarios or larger datasets, you might want to consider more advanced techniques, possibly involving AI for predictive text correction or data preprocessing in a larger NLP pipeline."
