My code is functioning, however, it isn't capturing the progress until a file transfer is completed. I want to print the progress for each file in real time. I am using Python 3.1 as it is supposed to be better at handling IO. Here is my code:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess, time, os, sys\n\ncmd = \"rsync.exe -vaz -P source/ dest/\"\np, line = True, 'start'\n\np = subprocess.Popen(cmd,\n                     shell=True,\n                     bufsize=64,\n                     stdin=subprocess.PIPE,\n                     stderr=subprocess.PIPE,\n                     stdout=subprocess.PIPE)\n\nfor line in p.stdout:\n    print(\">>> \" + str(line.rstrip()))\n    p.stdout.flush()\n```\n\nHow can I modify it such that it prints the progress of file transfers in real time?"

        "content": "To capture and print the progress of file transfers in real time using `subprocess.Popen()` with `rsync.exe` on Windows, you'll need to ensure that the output is processed line by line as it is generated. One issue with your current setup may be related to buffering, which can delay output until the buffer is full or the process ends.\n\nHere's a modified version of your script that should help achieve real-time output by using `universal_newlines=True` and iterating over the lines of stdout:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\n# Define the rsync command\ncmd = \"rsync.exe -vaz -P source/ dest/\"\n\n# Start the subprocess with universal_newlines=True to handle text output\np = subprocess.Popen(cmd,\n                     shell=True,\n                     bufsize=1,  # Line-buffered\n                     stdout=subprocess.PIPE,\n                     stderr=subprocess.PIPE,\n                     universal_newlines=True)\n\n# Iterate over the lines of stdout\nfor line in iter(p.stdout.readline, ''):\n    print(\">>> \" + line.rstrip())  # Print each line immediately\n    sys.stdout.flush()  # Ensure the output is flushed immediately\n\n# Wait for the process to complete and get the return code\np.stdout.close()\np.wait()\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n1. **Buffer Size**: Set `bufsize=1` to enable line-buffered output. This helps ensure that each line of output is available to be read immediately.\n\n2. **Universal Newlines**: Set `universal_newlines=True` to automatically handle text mode for reading lines. This makes `stdout` and `stderr` yield strings instead of bytes, making it easier to work with in Python 3.1.\n\n3. **Iterating with readline**: Instead of iterating directly over `p.stdout`, use `iter(p.stdout.readline, '')`. This reads each line as it becomes available.\n\n4. **Flushing stdout**: Use `sys.stdout.flush()` to forcefully flush the output buffer of your script, ensuring that each line is printed immediately.\n\nThese changes should help you achieve real-time progress updates from `rsync.exe`. Remember to replace `\"source/\"` and `\"dest/\"` with your actual source and destination paths."
