This data is typically gathered from government reports, organization disclosures, or databases that track refugee services.\n\nHowever, without specific data, I can't provide the names of the top five organizations. Generally, major organizations involved in refugee services in the U.S. include the International Rescue Committee (IRC), the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI), Church World Service (CWS), the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), and the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service (LIRS). These organizations are well-known for their extensive work in refugee resettlement and support services, but you would need the exact figures to rank them accurately based on the percentage of refugees served."
