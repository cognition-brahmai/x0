        "content": "To copy CAD drawings with \".dwg\" and \".dxf\" extensions from a source directory with subfolders to a destination directory while maintaining the original directory structure, you can use Python's `shutil.copytree` function in combination with a custom `ignore` function. This function will help you filter out files that do not have the required extensions.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Import Required Modules**: You need to import the `os` and `shutil` modules.\n\n2. **Define the Ignore Function**: Create a function that will filter files based on their extensions.\n\n3. **Use shutil.copytree**: Use the `shutil.copytree` method to copy files from the source to the destination.\n\nHere is a sample script:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport shutil\n\ndef ignore_files_with_other_extensions(src, names):\n    # Define the file extensions you want to keep\n    keep_extensions = {'.dwg', '.dxf'}\n    # Filter out files that do not match the desired extensions\n    return [name for name in names if not os.path.splitext(name)[1].lower() in keep_extensions]\n\ndef copy_cad_drawings(src_dir, dest_dir):\n    # Use shutil.copytree with the ignore parameter\n    shutil.copytree(src_dir, dest_dir, ignore=ignore_files_with_other_extensions)\n\n# Define your source and destination directories\nsource_directory = '/path/to/source_directory'\ndestination_directory = '/path/to/destination_directory'\n\n# Call the function to copy CAD drawings\ncopy_cad_drawings(source_directory, destination_directory)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **ignore_files_with_other_extensions Function**: This function generates a list of files to ignore by checking their extensions. Only files with \".dwg\" and \".dxf\" extensions are copied over.\n\n- **shutil.copytree**: This function is used to copy an entire directory tree from the source to the destination. The `ignore` parameter allows you to specify a function that determines which files to ignore.\n\n- **Maintaining Directory Structure**: The use of `shutil.copytree` inherently maintains the directory and subfolder structure while copying.\n\nMake sure to replace `'/path/to/source_directory'` and `'/path/to/destination_directory'` with your actual source and destination paths. Also, ensure that the destination directory does not already exist, as `shutil.copytree` requires it to be non-existent and will create it as part of the copying process."
