        "content": "Updating Anaconda can be done in a few simple steps. The 'anaconda' package you see is a meta-package that includes other packages and dependencies. Here's how you can update Anaconda:\n\n1. **Update Anaconda Navigator:**\n   - Open Anaconda Navigator.\n   - If there is an update available for Navigator itself, you will see a notification. Follow the prompt to update it.\n\n2. **Update Anaconda via Command Line:**\n   - Open the Anaconda Prompt (or your terminal if you're on macOS or Linux).\n   - First, update the conda package manager by running:\n     ```\n     conda update conda\n     ```\n   - Next, update Anaconda by running:\n     ```\n     conda update anaconda\n     ```\n   - If you want to update all packages in your Anaconda distribution, you can use:\n     ```\n     conda update --all\n     ```\n\n3. **Handling the 'custom' version:**\n   - The 'custom' label typically appears when you have manually installed or updated packages that differ from the default Anaconda distribution. This is normal and usually doesn't affect functionality.\n   - If you wish to revert to the default Anaconda package versions, you can create a new environment and install Anaconda there, or you can remove and reinstall Anaconda.\n\n4. **Best Practices:**\n   - Regularly update your Anaconda environment to keep up with the latest features and security patches.\n   - Consider creating separate conda environments for different projects to avoid dependency conflicts.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to keep your Anaconda installation and its packages up to date."
