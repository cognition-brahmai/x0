        "content": "Yes, you can use the `pandas` library in Python to open IBM SPSS (.sav) files by leveraging the `read_spss` function, which is available in `pandas` version 1.0.0 and later. This method doesn't require any additional DLL files or libraries, making it a convenient choice if you prefer a straightforward approach.\n\nHere's a simple example of how you can use `pandas` to read a .sav file:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Replace 'your_file.sav' with the path to your SPSS file\ndf = pd.read_spss('your_file.sav')\n\n# Display the first few rows of the dataframe\nprint(df.head())\n```\n\nThe `pandas.read_spss()` function reads the .sav file into a pandas DataFrame, which you can then manipulate and analyze using the powerful data manipulation capabilities of pandas.\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of `pandas` installed. You can upgrade or install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade pandas\n```\n\nThis approach should meet your requirements as it is maintained and doesn't need additional dependencies apart from pandas."
