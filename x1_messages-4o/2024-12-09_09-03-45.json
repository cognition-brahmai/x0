        "content": "To count the number of distinct values in a MySQL table, you can use the `COUNT` function in combination with the `DISTINCT` keyword. Here's the basic syntax:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT column_name) AS count_alias\nFROM table_name;\n```\n\n- `column_name`: The name of the column for which you want to count distinct values.\n- `table_name`: The name of the table from which you want to retrieve the data.\n- `count_alias`: An optional alias for the count result.\n\nFor example, if you have a table named `employees` and you want to count the number of distinct departments, you would use:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT department) AS distinct_departments\nFROM employees;\n```\n\nThis query will return the number of distinct departments in the `employees` table."
