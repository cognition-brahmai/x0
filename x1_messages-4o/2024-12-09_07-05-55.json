Here are some alternative methods:\n\n1. **Using the `str.format()` method**:\n   ```python\n   first = 10\n   second = 20\n   print(\"First number is {} and second number is {}\".format(first, second))\n   ```\n   You can also use named placeholders:\n   ```python\n   print(\"First number is {first} and second number is {second}\".format(first=first, second=second))\n   ```\n\n2. **Using f-strings (Python 3.6 and above)**:\n   ```python\n   first = 10\n   second = 20\n   print(f\"First number is {first} and second number is {second}\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Using concatenation with `str()`**:\n   ```python\n   first = 10\n   second = 20\n   print(\"First number is \" + str(first) + \" and second number is \" + str(second))\n   ```\n\n4. **Using `join()` with `map()`**:\n   ```python\n   first = 10\n   second = 20\n   print(\" \".join(map(str, [\"First number is\", first, \"and second number is\", second])))\n   ```\n\nEach of these methods will achieve the same result, so you can choose the one that best fits your style or needs."
