        "content": "To extract the first element from each list in a two-dimensional list in Python, you can use a list comprehension. The syntax you tried, `a[::1][0]`, doesn't achieve what you want because it doesn't iterate over the sublists. Instead, you can use the following approach:\n\n```python\na = [[4.0, 4, 4.0], [3.0, 3, 3.6], [3.5, 6, 4.8]]\nfirst_elements = [sublist[0] for sublist in a]\nprint(first_elements)\n```\n\nThis code snippet uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in `a` and extracts the first element (`sublist[0]`) from each sublist. When you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\n[4.0, 3.0, 3.5]\n```\n\nIf you want the result as a comma-separated string, you can convert the list to a string format like so:\n\n```python\nprint(', '.join(map(str, first_elements)))\n```\n\nThis will give you the output:\n\n```\n4.0, 3.0, 3.5\n```"
