Can someone suggest what I should do?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is due to the way you're trying to modify the DataFrame. When you use `df.xs('C')['x']`, it returns a copy of the row rather than a view, so any modifications you make to it won't affect the original DataFrame.\n\nTo assign a value to a specific cell in a DataFrame, you should use the `loc` indexer, which allows you to access a group of rows and columns by labels or a boolean array. Here\u2019s how you can achieve your goal:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Creating the DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(index=['A', 'B', 'C'], columns=['x', 'y'])\n\n# Assigning a value to a specific cell\ndf.loc['C', 'x'] = 10\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThis will correctly update the DataFrame to:\n\n```\n     x    y\nA  NaN  NaN\nB  NaN  NaN\nC   10  NaN\n```\n\nBy using `df.loc['C', 'x'] = 10`, you're directly modifying the value in the original DataFrame, which is why this approach works."
