I understand that the labels are 0 and 1 and the prediction is a floating-point number because p is the probability of belonging to a particular class. However, p is not necessarily 0 or 1. So, how does Keras calculate the accuracy? Does Keras automatically round our predictions to 0 or 1? For instance, in the following code, the accuracy is 0.749, but the targets are 0 and 1 and the predictions are floating-point numbers that are not necessarily 0.0 or 1.0.\n\n```python\nscores = model.evaluate(x=test_Features, \n                    y=test_Label)\nscores[1]\n0.74909090952439739\n```"

        "content": "In Keras, when dealing with binary classification problems, the accuracy metric is calculated by comparing the predicted class labels to the true class labels. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Predictions as Probabilities**: When your model outputs predictions, these are typically floating-point numbers between 0 and 1, representing the probability that a given input belongs to the positive class.\n\n2. **Thresholding**: To convert these probabilities into binary class predictions (0 or 1), Keras applies a threshold. By default, this threshold is 0.5. This means:\n   - If the predicted probability is greater than or equal to 0.5, the predicted class is 1.\n   - If the predicted probability is less than 0.5, the predicted class is 0.\n\n3. **Accuracy Calculation**: Once the predictions are thresholded to binary values, Keras calculates the accuracy by comparing these predicted class labels to the true labels. The accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions.\n\nIn your code snippet, the accuracy of 0.749 indicates that approximately 74.9% of the predictions matched the true labels when the predictions were thresholded at 0.5. Keras handles this thresholding step internally when computing the accuracy metric.\n\nIf you want to customize the threshold, you would need to manually apply it to the predictions before evaluating the accuracy, or define a custom metric function that uses a different threshold."
