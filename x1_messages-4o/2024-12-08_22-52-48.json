For example, the second term is 2 + 2 * 1 = 4, the third term is 4 + 2 * 2 = 8, and so on. Given this sequence, calculate the value of the third term. Please provide your answer in decimal form rounded to two decimal places."

The second term is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Second term} = \\text{First term} + 2 \\times 1 = 2 + 2 \\times 1 = 4\n   \\]\n\n3.
