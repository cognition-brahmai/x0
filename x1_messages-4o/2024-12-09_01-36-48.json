I want to stack these two lists together and write them to a text file in the form of columns. I tried using numpy.savetxt but received the following error: \"TypeError: float argument required, not numpy.string_\". How can I write both strings and float numbers to a text file, possibly avoiding using csv ( I want to make it readable for other people )? Is there another way of doing this instead of using numpy.savetxt?\n\nHere is the code I've been working on:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as num\n\nNAMES  = num.array(['NAME_1', 'NAME_2', 'NAME_3'])\nFLOATS = num.array([ 0.5    , 0.2     , 0.3     ])\n\nDAT =  num.column_stack((NAMES, FLOATS))\n\nnum.savetxt('test.txt', DAT, delimiter=\" \") \n```"

        "content": "The `numpy.savetxt` function is designed primarily for numeric data, which is why you're encountering a `TypeError` when trying to mix strings with numerical data. To achieve your goal of writing both strings and floats to a text file in a readable format, you can use Python's built-in file handling capabilities instead. Here's how you can modify your code to format and write the data manually:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nNAMES = np.array(['NAME_1', 'NAME_2', 'NAME_3'])\nFLOATS = np.array([0.5, 0.2, 0.3])\n\n# Stack the arrays column-wise\nDAT = np.column_stack((NAMES, FLOATS))\n\n# Open a file in write mode\nwith open('test.txt', 'w') as f:\n    # Iterate over each row in the stacked array\n    for row in DAT:\n        # Format the row to a string and write to the file\n        # Here, we join elements of each row with a space\n        f.write(f\"{row[0]} {row[1]:.2f}\\n\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Manual File Writing**: This code uses Python's file handling to open and write to a file. The `with open(...)` construct ensures that the file is properly closed after writing.\n- **Row Formatting**: Each row is formatted as a string with a space delimiter. The string part is taken directly, and the float is formatted to two decimal places using `:.2f`.\n- **Flexibility**: This method provides more control over the formatting and structure of the output file, making it readable and customizable.\n\nThis approach allows you to have a readable output file with both strings and floats arranged in columns."
