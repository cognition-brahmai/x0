        "content": "The statement \"The sun is made of gas\" holds true. The sun is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, which exist in a plasma state\u2014a hot, ionized form of gas. Here are three scientific sources supporting this statement:\n\n1. **NASA** - According to NASA, the sun is a huge ball of hydrogen and helium gases. These gases undergo nuclear fusion reactions in the sun's core, releasing energy that we perceive as sunlight.\n\n2. **European Space Agency (ESA)** - The ESA describes the sun as consisting mostly of hydrogen (about 74% by mass) and helium (about 24% by mass), with trace amounts of other elements. These elements are in a gaseous state under the extreme temperatures and pressures in the sun.\n\n3. **The Astrophysical Journal** - Numerous studies published in The Astrophysical Journal describe the sun's composition as primarily gaseous, with the core and other layers consisting largely of hydrogen and helium in a plasma state.\n\nThese sources collectively affirm that the sun is indeed made of gas, specifically hydrogen and helium, in a plasma form."
