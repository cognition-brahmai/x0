        "content": "In Python, when using type hints for tuples, it's necessary to specify the exact number of items in the tuple unlike when hinting for lists. This is due to the immutable nature of tuples. However, is there a way to make the number of items in a tuple type hint flexible? For instance, I tried using `tuple[*int]` but it did not work. Here's the code for reference:\n\n```python\ndef func(var: tuple[int, int]):\n    # do something\nfunc((1, 2))    # would be fine\nfunc((1, 2, 3)) # would throw an error\n\ndef func(var: list[int]):\n    # do something\nfunc([1])       # would be fine\nfunc([1, 2])    # would also be fine\nfunc([1, 2, 3]) # would also be fine\n\ndef func(var: tuple[*int]):\n```"

        "content": "In Python, type hints for tuples traditionally require you to specify the exact number of elements and their types. This is because tuples are immutable and their size is fixed. However, if you want to specify a tuple that can take a variable number of elements of the same type, you can use the `Tuple` type from the `typing` module in combination with the ellipsis (`...`). This allows you to define a tuple that can have a flexible number of items of a specified type.\n\nHere's how you can achieve that:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Tuple\n\ndef func(var: Tuple[int, ...]):\n    # do something\n    print(var)\n\nfunc((1, 2))       # This is fine\nfunc((1, 2, 3))    # This is also fine\nfunc((1, 2, 3, 4)) # This is also fine\n```\n\nIn the example above, `Tuple[int, ...]` is used to indicate that `var` can be a tuple containing any number of integers. The ellipsis (`...`) signifies that the tuple can contain zero or more items of the specified type. This provides the flexibility you're looking for with tuples, similar to lists, while still maintaining type safety."
