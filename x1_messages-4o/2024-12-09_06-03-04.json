I wanted to install a newer version, Python 3.8, without uninstalling the previous versions due to dependencies. I am able to run my scripts using `python3.8 app.py` with no issues. However, when trying to install new packages with pip using the command `python3.8 -m pip install pylint`, I encounter an error: `AttributeError: module 'platform' has no attribute 'linux_distribution'`. I have tried using `sudo update-alternatives --config python3` and selecting python3.8, and also creating a symbolic link using `sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.5 /usr/bin/python3`, all to no avail. How can I resolve this issue so that I can install new packages to my new version of Python?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, `AttributeError: module 'platform' has no attribute 'linux_distribution'`, is caused by the fact that the `linux_distribution` function has been removed in Python 3.8. This issue can occur if the `pip` package version you're using is not compatible with Python 3.8. Here's how you can resolve the issue and install packages for Python 3.8:\n\n1. **Ensure pip is installed for Python 3.8:**\n   First, check if `pip` is installed specifically for Python 3.8. You can do this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.8 -m ensurepip\n   ```\n\n   This will ensure that `pip` is installed for Python 3.8.\n\n2. **Upgrade pip:**\n   Sometimes the issue is due to an outdated version of `pip`. Upgrade `pip` for Python 3.8 using:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.8 -m pip install --upgrade pip\n   ```\n\n3. **Install packages with the upgraded pip:**\n   Now try installing your desired package again:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.8 -m pip install pylint\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify the Installation:**\n   After installing, verify that `pylint` is installed for Python 3.8 by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.8 -m pylint --version\n   ```\n\n5. **Check for Virtual Environment Usage (Optional):**\n   It may be beneficial to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies for different projects. You can create a virtual environment with Python 3.8 as follows:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.8 -m venv myenv\n   ```\n\n   Activate the virtual environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n   Then, within the virtual environment, you can use `pip` normally:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pylint\n   ```\n\n   When done, you can deactivate the environment with:\n\n   ```bash\n   deactivate\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to manage and install packages for Python 3.8 without interfering with the existing versions."
