If this cannot be solved with a single regular expression, what would be the most elegant code or one-liner solution using regular expressions in any language (Perl, Ruby, Python, etc.)? I'm specifically looking for an O(n) solution using regular expressions."

        "content": "Finding the longest common prefix of two strings using regular expressions isn't straightforward because regular expressions are not inherently designed to solve problems that require comparing parts of different strings. They are more suited for pattern matching within individual strings. However, you can use a combination of string manipulation and regular expressions to solve this problem efficiently.\n\nHere's a one-liner solution in Python that doesn't rely solely on regular expressions but is elegant and operates in O(n) time complexity:\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_prefix(s1, s2):\n    return ''.join(ch1 for ch1, ch2 in zip(s1, s2) if ch1 == ch2)\n\n# Example usage:\ns1 = \"flower\"\ns2 = \"flow\"\nprint(longest_common_prefix(s1, s2))  # Output: \"flow\"\n```\n\nThis code uses `zip` to pair characters from both strings and iterates through these pairs. It then joins the characters from the pairs where both characters are equal. This approach runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the shorter string, and avoids the need for regular expressions altogether, which is more suitable for this kind of problem."
