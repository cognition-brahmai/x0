Here's a simple script to subtract 9 from each element of the given vector and store the result in a new vector:\n\n```matlab\n% Original vector\noriginal_vector = [5, 3, 7, 2, 4];\n\n% Subtract 9 from each element\nnew_vector = original_vector - 9;\n\n% Display the new vector\ndisp(new_vector);\n```\n\nWhen you run this code in MATLAB, it will display the new vector as the output, which is the result of subtracting 9 from each element of the original vector."
