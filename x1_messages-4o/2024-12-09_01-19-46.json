Although I've managed to generate the figure, I'm struggling with two issues. First, I'd like to be able to zoom in on the exported image (like a PNG) in the same way the `show()` command allows in matplotlib. Second, the labels on the Y axis are too close together and difficult to read. I've attempted to improve resolution based on advice from another Stack Overflow post, but the details are still not adequately clear. How can I enhance the readability of my figure? Note: I am using matplotlib 1.1.1 and python 2.7."

        "content": "To enhance the readability of your figure and allow for better zoom capabilities, you can consider the following suggestions:\n\n1. **Increase Figure Size and DPI:**\n   You can increase the size and DPI of your figure to make it clearer when exported. This will give you a higher resolution image which allows for better zooming in on details.\n\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n   # Increase figure size and DPI\n   plt.figure(figsize=(16, 9), dpi=300)\n   ```\n\n2. **Adjusting Y-axis Label Size:**\n   You can rotate the labels on the Y-axis and adjust their font size to make them more readable.\n\n   ```python\n   # Assuming you have a barh plot with y-values\n   y_values = range(len(your_data))  # replace with your actual y-values\n   plt.yticks(y_values, labels=your_labels, fontsize=8)  # Adjust fontsize as needed\n   ```\n\n3. **Using `tight_layout`:**\n   Utilize matplotlib\u2019s `tight_layout` to automatically adjust subplot parameters to give specified padding.\n\n   ```python\n   plt.tight_layout()\n   ```\n\n4. **Interactive Zooming in Exported Images:**\n   For interactive zooming in exported images, consider using vector graphics formats like SVG or PDF instead of PNG. These formats allow for infinite zooming without loss of quality.\n\n   ```python\n   plt.savefig('output.svg', format='svg')  # Save as SVG\n   ```\n\n5. **Use Pan and Zoom Tools in Interactive Backends:**\n   If you want interactivity similar to `show()`, consider using interactive backends like `TkAgg`, `Qt5Agg`, or `WebAgg`. These allow for interactive features such as panning and zooming directly in a notebook or a standalone window.\n\n6. **Segment the Data:**\n   If the number of tasks is too large to be effectively visualized in one image, consider breaking it down into smaller segments or batches and create multiple plots. This will allow for better readability.\n\n7. **Upgrade Matplotlib and Python:**\n   Lastly, consider upgrading to a more recent version of matplotlib and Python, as newer versions come with improved features, performance, and bug fixes that might help with your plotting needs.\n\nBy implementing these changes, you should be able to enhance the readability of your figure and maintain functionality similar to the interactive zoom provided by `show()`."
