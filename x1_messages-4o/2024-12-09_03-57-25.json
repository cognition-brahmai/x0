        "content": "Why is the sine calculation using numpy orders of magnitude slower than cosine on Linux Mint? For the same numpy array, calculating np.cos takes 3.2 seconds, whereas np.sin runs for 548 seconds (nine minutes). I've got a pulse signal which I need to modulate onto a HF-carrier, simulating a Laser Doppler Vibrometer. Therefore signal and its time basis need to be resampled to match the carrier's higher sampling rate. In the demodulation process both the in-phase carrier cos(omega * t) and the phase-shifted carrier sin(omega * t) are needed. The time vector t1 is being calculated using np.linspace directly, t2 uses the method implemented in scipy.signal.resample. However, the time vectors are not identical. At 80 million samples the difference t1 - t2 reaches 1e-8. Calculating the in-phase and shifted carrier of t1 takes 3.2 seconds each on my machine. With t2, however, calculating the shifted carrier takes 540 seconds. Nine minutes. For nearly the same 80 million values. I can reproduce this bug on both my 32-bit laptop and my 64-bit tower, both running Linux Mint 17. On my flat mate's MacBook, however, the \"slow sine\" takes as little time as the other three calculations. I am running Linux Mint 17.03 on a 64-bit AMD processor and Linux Mint 17.2 on 32-bit Intel processor."

        "content": "The significant difference in computation time for `np.sin` compared to `np.cos` on your Linux Mint systems might be attributed to several factors. Here are some potential explanations and troubleshooting steps:\n\n1. **Library Differences**: Different implementations of mathematical libraries (like glibc or libm) can lead to variations in performance. Check if your systems are using different versions of these libraries compared to the MacBook.\n\n2. **NumPy Version**: Ensure that you are using the same version of NumPy on all systems. Different versions might have optimizations for certain functions.\n\n3. **Compiler Optimizations**: The way NumPy is compiled can impact performance. Check if NumPy was compiled with different compiler flags on your Linux systems. You might consider recompiling NumPy with optimized flags for your specific architecture.\n\n4. **Processor Architecture**: Different processors might have different performance characteristics for certain operations. Check if there are any specific optimizations available for your AMD or Intel processors.\n\n5. **Caching and Memory Access Patterns**: The difference in time vectors (t1 vs t2) and their memory alignment may affect cache usage. Investigate if the memory alignment or access pattern differences between these vectors could be causing the slowdown.\n\n6. **System Load**: Ensure that no other processes are consuming significant CPU resources during your tests. System load can affect performance unpredictably.\n\n7. **Python Environment**: Differences in Python environments (e.g., Anaconda vs. system Python) could lead to different performance characteristics. Try using a clean virtual environment to see if the issue persists.\n\n8. **Profiling**: Use a profiler to track where the time is being spent during the computation. This might give insights into whether a particular function call or operation is causing the slowdown.\n\n9. **Hardware-Specific Optimizations**: Some hardware-specific optimizations might not be present or properly configured on your Linux systems. Check for any available processor-specific optimizations.\n\nIf after exploring these avenues the issue persists, you might consider reaching out to the NumPy community or developers with detailed information, as this could be a platform-specific issue that requires further investigation."
