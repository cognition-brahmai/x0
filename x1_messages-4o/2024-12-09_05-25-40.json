I am using subprocess.Popen to run the code and collect the output from stdout and stderr into a subprocess.PIPE. When I run the simulation, I can't tell how the code is progressing. Here is the relevant section of my code:\n\n```python\nret_val = subprocess.Popen( run_command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, shell=True )\noutput, errors = ret_val.communicate()\nlog_file.write(output)\nprint output\nif( ret_val.returncode ):\n    print \"RUN failed\\n\\n%s\\n\\n\" % (errors)\n    success = False\n\nif( errors ): log_file.write(\"\\n\\n%s\\n\\n\" % errors)\n```\n\nInitially, I was piping the run_command through tee so that a copy went directly to the log-file, and the stream still output directly to the terminal. However, with this approach, I can't store any errors. I have a temporary solution where I run `tail -f log.txt` in another terminal. Here's the temporary solution:\n\n```python\nret_val = subprocess.Popen( run_command, stdout=log_file, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, shell=True )\nwhile not ret_val.poll():\n    log_file.flush()\n```"

        "content": "To achieve both live-streaming of the output and error checking while also storing the output for logging, you can modify your script to read the output and errors in real-time and redirect them to both the terminal and the log file. Here's how you can do it using the `subprocess` module:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\n# Open the log file in write mode\nwith open('log.txt', 'w') as log_file:\n    # Start the subprocess with stdout and stderr as pipes\n    ret_val = subprocess.Popen(run_command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, shell=True, text=True)\n\n    # Continuously read from stdout and stderr\n    while True:\n        # Read a line from stdout\n        output = ret_val.stdout.readline()\n        if output == '' and ret_val.poll() is not None:\n            break\n        if output:\n            # Write the output to the log file and print it\n            log_file.write(output)\n            print(output, end='')\n\n        # Read a line from stderr\n        errors = ret_val.stderr.readline()\n        if errors:\n            # Write the errors to the log file and print them\n            log_file.write(errors)\n            print(errors, end='')\n\n    # Ensure all remaining output and errors are written to the log file\n    output, errors = ret_val.communicate()\n    if output:\n        log_file.write(output)\n        print(output, end='')\n    if errors:\n        log_file.write(errors)\n        print(errors, end='')\n\n    # Check the return code to determine if the subprocess failed\n    if ret_val.returncode:\n        print(\"RUN failed\\n\\n\")\n        success = False\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Text Mode**: Use `text=True` (or `universal_newlines=True` in older Python versions) to ensure that the output from `stdout` and `stderr` is treated as text rather than bytes.\n- **Real-time Reading**: Use `readline()` to read the output line-by-line. This allows you to print and log the output as it appears.\n- **Polling**: Continuously check if the process is still running with `poll()`. When it returns a value other than `None`, the process has finished.\n- **Final Communication**: Use `communicate()` at the end to capture any remaining output or errors that were not handled by the `readline()` loop.\n\nThis approach should give you real-time streaming of the output to the terminal while also logging it to a file for later review."
