After some research, I found a lot of discussions around the concept of optional static typing in Python, like in PEP 3107 and the articles \"Adding Optional Static Typing to Python\" and its part 2. However, I'm still unclear on the progression of this concept. I would like to know if there are any implementations of static typing using the parameter-annotation in Python 3? Also, did any of the ideas about parameterized-types make it into Python 3?"

        "content": "In Python 3, function annotations were introduced in PEP 3107, allowing you to attach metadata to function arguments and return values. These annotations are stored in the function's `__annotations__` attribute. However, annotations themselves don't enforce any type checking; they are merely a way to document the expected types.\n\nThe concept of static typing in Python has evolved over time, and significant progress has been made since the introduction of function annotations. The most notable advancement is the introduction of type hints in PEP 484, which formalized a standard way of specifying types using annotations. This was further enhanced by PEP 526, which introduced variable annotations, and PEP 563, which allowed for postponed evaluation of type annotations.\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n1. **Implementation of Static Typing Using Annotations**: While Python's type hints and annotations don't enforce type checks at runtime, they can be used with external tools like `mypy` for static type checking. `mypy` is a static type checker for Python that reads these annotations and checks for type consistency. This allows developers to catch potential type-related errors during development.\n\n2. **Parameterized Types**: Yes, parameterized types (generics) have been introduced and are now part of Python's type system. PEP 484 introduced the `typing` module, which provides support for generic types, such as `List[T]`, `Dict[K, V]`, `Optional[T]`, and more. This allows for more precise type definitions, especially when working with collections.\n\nOverall, while Python remains a dynamically typed language, the integration of type hints and static type checking tools has greatly improved the ability to use static typing in Python, making it easier to manage and understand codebases, especially in larger projects."
