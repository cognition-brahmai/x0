Specifically:\n\n- \\(2^1 - 1 = 1\\)\n- \\(2^2 - 1 = 3\\)\n- \\(2^3 - 1 = 7\\)\n- \\(2^4 - 1 = 15\\)\n- \\(2^5 - 1 = 31\\)\n- \\(2^6 - 1 = 63\\)\n- \\(2^7 - 1 = 127\\)\n- \\(2^8 - 1 = 255\\)\n- \\(2^9 - 1 = 511\\)\n- \\(2^{10} - 1 = 1023\\)\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next three numbers in the sequence would be:\n\n- \\(2^{11} - 1 = 2047\\)\n- \\(2^{12} - 1 = 4095\\)\n- \\(2^{13} - 1 = 8191\\)\n\nSo, the next three numbers are 2047, 4095, and 8191."
