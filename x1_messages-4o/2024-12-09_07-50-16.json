        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the mode in which you're opening the file. The `pickle` module in Python is designed to work with binary files. When you use the `open()` function, you need to specify that the file should be opened in binary mode. Here's how you can fix your code:\n\n```python\nimport pickle\n\nx = 123\nwith open('data.pkl', 'wb') as f:  # Change 'w' to 'wb' to open in write-binary mode\n    pickle.dump(x, f)\n```\n\nAdditionally, the second snippet you provided has a different issue. The `pickle.dump()` function requires two arguments: the object to be pickled and the file object. The code `pickle.dump(123)` is incomplete and will not work as expected. Instead, you should be using `pickle.dumps()` if you want to get the pickled bytes as a string:\n\n```python\nimport pickle\n\ndump = pickle.dumps(123)  # Use `dumps` to get the pickled data as bytes\nprint(dump)\n```\n\nIn summary:\n\n1. Use `open('data.pkl', 'wb')` to open files for pickling in binary mode.\n2. Use `pickle.dump()` to write to a file.\n3. Use `pickle.dumps()` to get the serialized object as bytes."
