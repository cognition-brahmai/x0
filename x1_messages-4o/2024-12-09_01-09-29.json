However, I'm having trouble figuring out how to achieve separate compilation with cmake. I read through the NVCC documentation and found out how to compile device object using the -dc option, and how to link them using the -dlink. My attempts to get this working with cmake have been unsuccessful. I'm using cmake 2.8.10.2 and the head of the trunk of FindCUDA.cmake. I'm unsure of how to specify which files should be compiled and how to link them into a library. Particularly, I don't understand the syntax of the function \"CUDA_LINK_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECTS output_file_var cuda_target options object_files source_files\". I'm unclear about what \"output_file_var\" and \"cuda_target\" are. Can anyone help me understand how to compile and link a CUDA library using cmake? I've tried the following code but it doesn't work:\n\n```\ncuda_compile(DEVICEMANAGER_O devicemanager.cu OPTIONS -dc)\ncuda_compile(BLUB_O blub.cu OPTIONS -dc)\nCUDA_LINK_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECTS(TEST_O gpuacceleration\n                                          \"\"  DEVICEMANGER_O BLUB_O)\nset(LIB_TYPE SHARED)\n#cuda_add_library(gpuacceleration ${LIB_TYPE} \n  #${gpuacc_SRCS} \n  #devicemanager.cu\n  #blub.cu\n  #DEVICEMANAGER_O\n#  TEST_O\n#)\n```\n\nAlso, after a friend consulted the developer of the FindCUDA.cmake, a bug got fixed in the example provided with FindCUDA.cmake (https://gforge.sci.utah.edu/gf/project/findcuda/scmsvn/?action=browse&path=%2Fcheckout%2Ftrunk%2FFindCuda.html). Now, I'm able to build the example. In my project, I can build the library as needed using the following code:\n\n```\nset(LIB_TYPE SHARED)\nset(CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION ON)\ncuda_add_library(gpuacceleration ${LIB_TYPE} \n blub.cu\n blab.cu\n)\n```\n\nHowever, I can't link against this library. I was able to link against it when I built the library without separate compilation. I'm getting the following error for every file with a function used in the interface:\n\n```\nundefined reference to `__cudaRegisterLinkedBinary_53_tmpxft_00005ab4_00000000_6_blub_cpp1_ii_d07d5695'\n```\n\nThe build goes through without any warnings. Any ideas on how to get this working would be greatly appreciated."

        "content": "To address your issue with separate compilation and linking in a CUDA library using CMake, let's focus on the steps you need to take to properly compile and link your CUDA objects. You've already identified that separate compilation involves compiling objects with the `-dc` flag and linking them with `-dlink`. Let's break down what you need to do:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Separate Compilation with CMake\n\n1. **Ensure CMake Version Compatibility:**\n   You're using CMake 2.8.10.2, which is quite old. If possible, consider upgrading to a newer version of CMake, as they have improved support for CUDA, especially regarding separable compilation.\n\n2. **Compile CUDA Source Files with `-dc`:**\n   You already know how to compile individual CUDA files with `-dc`. The `cuda_compile` function is used for this. Just make sure that these object files are not added to the library directly.\n\n   ```cmake\n   cuda_compile(DEVICEMANAGER_O devicemanager.cu OPTIONS -dc)\n   cuda_compile(BLUB_O blub.cu OPTIONS -dc)\n   ```\n\n3. **Link Device Code with `-dlink`:**\n   The `CUDA_LINK_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECTS` function is used for linking the compiled object files into a single file that can be linked into your library. Here's how you might use it:\n\n   ```cmake\n   CUDA_LINK_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECTS(\n     TEST_O # Output object file\n     gpuacceleration # The target name, typically your library target\n     \"\" # Additional options, if any\n     DEVICEMANAGER_O BLUB_O # Object files to link\n   )\n   ```\n\n   In this context:\n   - `output_file_var` is the variable that will hold the result object file, `TEST_O`.\n   - `cuda_target` refers to your library or executable target, here `gpuacceleration`.\n\n4. **Create the Library:**\n   Once you have the linked device code object, you can create the library with `cuda_add_library`:\n\n   ```cmake\n   set(LIB_TYPE SHARED)\n   set(CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION ON)\n   add_library(gpuacceleration ${LIB_TYPE} ${gpuacc_SRCS} TEST_O)\n   ```\n\n   Ensure that `TEST_O` is included in the list of source files for the library.\n\n5. **Linking the Library:**\n   Make sure that when you link against `gpuacceleration`, you link it properly in your executable or any other library:\n\n   ```cmake\n   target_link_libraries(your_executable gpuacceleration)\n   ```\n\n### Diagnosing Undefined References\n\nThe error message you received indicates that the device linking step might not have been completed successfully. Here are some troubleshooting tips:\n\n- **Check Linking Order:** Ensure that the device code linking step (`CUDA_LINK_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECTS`) is correctly generating `TEST_O` and that this object is included in your library.\n\n- **Verify CMake Output:** Double-check the CMake output to ensure that the `-dlink` step is executed without warnings or errors.\n\n- **Compile CMake Project from Scratch:** Sometimes, old build artifacts can cause issues. Try deleting your build directory and re-running CMake from scratch to ensure that everything is being built correctly.\n\n- **Consult Updated Documentation:** Given the age of your CMake version, newer versions might have simplified or changed how CUDA separate compilation is handled. If upgrading is an option, it could resolve many issues.\n\nBy following these steps and ensuring that each part of the process is handled correctly, you should be able to successfully compile and link your CUDA library with separate compilation."
