        "content": "Yes, you can make a `tkinter` canvas dynamically resize its width according to the window size by using the `pack()` or `grid()` geometry manager with the appropriate options. Here\u2019s a simple example using the `pack()` method to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\n\ndef on_resize(event):\n    # Optionally, you can perform additional actions here when the canvas resizes\n    canvas_width = event.width\n    canvas_height = event.height\n    print(f\"Canvas resized to: {canvas_width}x{canvas_height}\")\n\n# Create the main window\nroot = tk.Tk()\nroot.title(\"Resizable Canvas\")\n\n# Create a canvas widget\ncanvas = tk.Canvas(root, bg=\"lightblue\")\ncanvas.pack(fill=tk.BOTH, expand=True)\n\n# Bind the configure event to the on_resize function\ncanvas.bind(\"<Configure>\", on_resize)\n\n# Start the main event loop\nroot.mainloop()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`pack(fill=tk.BOTH, expand=True)`:** This makes the canvas fill the entire window space both horizontally and vertically. The `expand=True` option allows the canvas to grow and shrink as the window is resized.\n- **`<Configure>` event:** This event is triggered whenever the canvas is resized. Binding this event to a callback function (like `on_resize`) allows you to execute custom logic whenever the canvas size changes, such as redrawing shapes or updating layout.\n\nIf you prefer using the `grid()` geometry manager, you can achieve similar behavior like this:\n\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\n\ndef on_resize(event):\n    canvas_width = event.width\n    canvas_height = event.height\n    print(f\"Canvas resized to: {canvas_width}x{canvas_height}\")\n\nroot = tk.Tk()\nroot.title(\"Resizable Canvas\")\n\ncanvas = tk.Canvas(root, bg=\"lightblue\")\ncanvas.grid(row=0, column=0, sticky=\"nsew\")\n\n# Configure grid row and column to expand\nroot.grid_rowconfigure(0, weight=1)\nroot.grid_columnconfigure(0, weight=1)\n\ncanvas.bind(\"<Configure>\", on_resize)\n\nroot.mainloop()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`sticky=\"nsew\"`:** This makes the canvas stick to all sides (north, south, east, and west) within its grid cell, allowing it to resize with the window.\n- **`grid_rowconfigure` and `grid_columnconfigure`:** These methods are used to specify that the row and column containing the canvas should expand when the window is resized.\n\nBoth of these methods allow the canvas to dynamically adjust its size when the window is resized."
