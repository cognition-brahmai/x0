I have an array:\n```\na = array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])\n```\nI'd like to flatten it, joining the two inner lists into one flat array entry. My current approach is:\n```\narray(list(flatten(a)))\n```\nHowever, this seems inefficient due to the list cast, as I want to end up with an array and not a generator. Additionally, how can I generalize this to an array like this:\n```\nb = array([[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]], [[10,11,12],[13,14,15]]])\n```\nwhere the result should be:\n```\nb = array([[1,2,3,4,5,6],\n           [10,11,12,13,14,15]])\n```\nAre there builtin/efficient numpy/scipy operators for this?"

        "content": "In NumPy, you can efficiently flatten arrays using the `numpy.ndarray.flatten()` method or the `numpy.ravel()` function. These methods are designed to handle flattening operations efficiently.\n\nHere's how you can flatten a 2D array:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\nflattened_a = a.flatten()\n\nprint(flattened_a)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n[1 2 3 4 5 6]\n```\n\nFor flattening a 3D array like `b` into a 2D array where each sub-array is flattened, you can first reshape the array and then flatten the last two dimensions:\n\n```python\nb = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], \n              [[10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15]]])\n\n# Reshape the array to combine the last two dimensions\nreshaped_b = b.reshape(b.shape[0], -1)\n\nprint(reshaped_b)\n```\n\nThis will produce the desired output:\n\n```\n[[ 1  2  3  4  5  6]\n [10 11 12 13 14 15]]\n```\n\nThe `reshape` method is a powerful tool in NumPy that allows you to change the shape of an array without altering its data, which is generally very efficient. By using `-1` in the shape, you let NumPy calculate the appropriate size for that dimension automatically based on the array's total size and the other specified dimensions."
