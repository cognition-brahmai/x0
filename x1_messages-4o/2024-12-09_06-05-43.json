The original query is:\n\n```python\nfor e in q:\n    msg = Message.objects.create(\n        recipient_number=e.mobile,\n        content=batch.content,\n        sender=e.contact_owner,\n        billee=batch.user,\n        sender_name=batch.sender_name\n    )\n```\n\nI'm not sure whether the following code will loop through all the entries first then hit the database. Is this the correct way to use `bulk_create` in Django?\n\n```python\nmsg = Message.objects.bulk_create({\n    Message (\n        recipient_number=e.mobile,\n        content=batch.content,\n        sender=e.contact_owner,\n        billee=batch.user,\n        sender_name=batch.sender_name\n    ),\n})\n```"

        "content": "When using `bulk_create` in Django, you need to pass a list of instances you want to create, not a set or dictionary. The `bulk_create` method is designed to create multiple instances of a model in a single query, which can be more efficient than creating each instance individually.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use `bulk_create` correctly:\n\n```python\nmessages = []  # Initialize an empty list to hold message instances\n\nfor e in q:\n    msg = Message(\n        recipient_number=e.mobile,\n        content=batch.content,\n        sender=e.contact_owner,\n        billee=batch.user,\n        sender_name=batch.sender_name\n    )\n    messages.append(msg)  # Add each message instance to the list\n\n# Use bulk_create to create all message instances in a single query\nMessage.objects.bulk_create(messages)\n```\n\nIn this code, you iterate over your query `q`, create a `Message` instance for each entry, and append it to the `messages` list. After the loop, you call `bulk_create` with the list of messages, which will insert all of them into the database in one go. This approach will indeed loop through all the entries first to prepare the list of message objects, but it will hit the database only once when `bulk_create` is called."
