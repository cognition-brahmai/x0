Even though I've installed it using `pip install djangorestframework`, I'm still getting an error when I run `python3 manage.py syncdb`.

        "content": "The error message you're encountering suggests that Django Rest Framework (DRF) is not recognized by your Django project. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify Installation**:\n   Make sure that Django Rest Framework is installed in the environment you're using. You can verify this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip show djangorestframework\n   ```\n\n   If it's not installed, you can install it using:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install djangorestframework\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Virtual Environment**:\n   Ensure that you are operating within the correct virtual environment where DRF is installed. If you are using a virtual environment, activate it using:\n\n   ```bash\n   source /path/to/your/venv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n   Or on Windows:\n\n   ```bash\n   .\\path\\to\\your\\venv\\Scripts\\activate\n   ```\n\n3. **Add to Installed Apps**:\n   Make sure that `'rest_framework'` is added to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in your Django project's `settings.py` file. It should look something like this:\n\n   ```python\n   INSTALLED_APPS = [\n       ...\n       'rest_framework',\n       ...\n   ]\n   ```\n\n4. **Check Python Path**:\n   Ensure that you are using the correct version of Python that has DRF installed. Sometimes, there can be multiple versions of Python installed on your system, and the wrong one might be used.\n\n   Run:\n\n   ```bash\n   which python3\n   ```\n\n   Then, ensure that this Python path is the one associated with your virtual environment (if you're using one).\n\n5. **Migrate Instead of Syncdb**:\n   The `syncdb` command was deprecated in Django 1.9 and replaced with `migrate`. Make sure you are using the correct command:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 manage.py migrate\n   ```\n\n6. **Reinstall Packages**:\n   If the issue persists, try uninstalling and reinstalling the package:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall djangorestframework\n   pip install djangorestframework\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `ImportError` and successfully use Django Rest Framework in your project. If the problem persists, double-check for any typos or misconfigurations in your project setup."
