However, when I run PyTorch training on the GPU, I receive a warning that says, \"Found GPU0 GeForce GTX 770 which is of cuda capability 3.0. PyTorch no longer supports this GPU because it is too old. The minimum cuda capability that we support is 3.5.\" Consequently, I encounter an error that states \"RuntimeError: CUDA error: no kernel image is available for execution on the device\". I was wondering if there is an older version of PyTorch that supports GPUs with CUDA capability 3.0? If so, could you please tell me which version that is and where I can find this information? Is there a table that lists the supported CUDA versions and compatibility versions? For reference, I have CUDA 10.1 installed."

        "content": "The warning you're encountering is because your NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770 GPU has a CUDA Compute Capability of 3.0, which is not supported by the more recent versions of PyTorch. PyTorch dropped support for CUDA Compute Capabilities below 3.5 starting from version 1.6.0. To work around this limitation, you can use an older version of PyTorch that still supports CUDA 3.0.\n\nThe last version of PyTorch that supported CUDA 3.0 was version 1.5.1. You should be able to use this version with your GPU. Here's how you can install it:\n\n1. **Ensure Compatibility**: First, make sure that your CUDA version is compatible with the PyTorch version you are installing. PyTorch 1.5.1 is compatible with CUDA 10.1, so you should be fine there.\n\n2. **Install PyTorch 1.5.1**: You can use pip or conda to install PyTorch 1.5.1 with CUDA 10.1 support. Here's how you can do it with pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install torch==1.5.1+cu101 torchvision==0.6.1+cu101 torchaudio==0.5.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html\n   ```\n\n   Or with conda:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda install pytorch==1.5.1 torchvision==0.6.1 cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch\n   ```\n\n3. **Check Compatibility**: After installing, ensure that the installation is successful and compatible with your GPU by running a small test script to verify that PyTorch can access the GPU.\n\nIn terms of resources, the official PyTorch website and its GitHub repository are the best places to find compatibility information. While there isn't a single table that lists all supported CUDA versions and compatibility versions in one place, the release notes for each PyTorch version generally specify the supported CUDA versions.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that using older versions of software might expose you to bugs or security vulnerabilities that have been fixed in later versions, so it's always a trade-off between compatibility and staying updated with the latest features and security patches."
