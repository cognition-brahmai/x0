The error message includes \"NoSource: No source for code: '/home/matthew/.hudson/jobs/myproject/workspace/tests/unit/util.py'\" and \"No source for code: '/home/matthew/.hudson/jobs/myproject/workspace/__init__.py'\". What's puzzling is that the files that 'coverage' is looking for were never there in the first place. Also, note that Hudson's workspace isn't a Python module, so '__init__.py' wouldn't be there. This issue isn't exclusive to Hudson as I've also seen similar messages when running 'nostests' with 'coverage' in the directory itself. How can I resolve this?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with the \"No source for code\" message in `coverage` usually arises when the coverage tool is unable to find the source files it is supposed to analyze. Here are some steps you can take to address this problem:\n\n1. **Check the Coverage Configuration**:\n   - Ensure that your `.coveragerc` file or the command-line options for `coverage` are correctly set up to include only the directories and files you actually want to measure coverage for. Misconfigured paths can lead `coverage` to search for files that don't exist.\n\n2. **Verify the File Paths**:\n   - Double-check the paths mentioned in the error to ensure that they are indeed wrong or not required. Sometimes, symbolic links or misconfigured paths in your setup can lead coverage to look in incorrect locations.\n\n3. **Modify the Source Specification**:\n   - You can explicitly specify which files or directories should be included in the coverage report by using the `--source` option in your coverage command. For example:\n     ```bash\n     coverage run --source=myproject -m nose\n     ```\n   - This will restrict coverage to only look for source files within the `myproject` directory.\n\n4. **Clean the Environment**:\n   - Sometimes stale or cached data might cause issues. Clean your environment by deleting any `.coverage` files or coverage-related caches, and then re-run the tests.\n\n5. **Review the Nose and Coverage Versions**:\n   - Ensure that you are using compatible versions of `nose` and `coverage`. Sometimes, newer versions of the tools have bug fixes for issues like these.\n\n6. **Look for Symlink Issues**:\n   - If your workspace or project uses symbolic links, ensure that they are correctly pointing to their respective targets.\n\n7. **Investigate Hudson Configuration**:\n   - Since the issue also appears in Hudson, check if there are any differences in how Hudson sets up the environment compared to your local setup. Sometimes environment variables or paths are altered in CI/CD pipelines.\n\n8. **Examine Test Discovery**:\n   - Ensure that `nose` is discovering and running the correct set of tests. Misconfigured test discovery can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior in coverage analysis.\n\nBy systematically going through these steps, you should be able to identify and fix the root cause of the \"No source for code\" message."
