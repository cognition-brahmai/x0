For this task, I am using a pretrained model, MobileNet_v2, however, I am encountering an issue when trying to change the FC layer. It seems there is no model.fc attribute. How can I modify the FC layer of this model?"

        "content": "In PyTorch, when you're working with pretrained models like MobileNet_v2, the fully connected layer is not named `fc` as it might be in some other models like ResNet. Instead, MobileNet_v2 uses a classifier layer at the end of the network. To modify the fully connected layer to adapt it for your specific number of classes (e.g., 10 classes), you would typically modify the `classifier` attribute of the model.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Load the pretrained MobileNet_v2 model.\n2. Modify the classifier layer to match the number of output classes you have.\n3. Replace the last layer with a new fully connected layer that has the correct number of output features.\n\nHere's a sample code snippet to show you how this can be done:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nfrom torchvision import models\n\n# Load the pretrained MobileNet_v2 model\nmodel = models.mobilenet_v2(pretrained=True)\n\n# Get the number of input features for the last layer\nnum_ftrs = model.classifier[1].in_features\n\n# Modify the classifier layer\nmodel.classifier[1] = nn.Linear(num_ftrs, 10)  # Assuming you have 10 classes\n\n# Print the modified model architecture\nprint(model)\n```\n\nIn this snippet:\n- `model.classifier[1]` accesses the last layer of the classifier, which is a `nn.Linear` layer. The `[1]` index is used because the classifier consists of a `Sequential` container with two elements: a dropout layer and a fully connected layer.\n- `nn.Linear(num_ftrs, 10)` creates a new linear layer with the same number of input features as the original, but with 10 output features, which corresponds to the number of classes you have.\n\nNow your MobileNet_v2 model is ready to be trained on your dataset with 10 classes!"
