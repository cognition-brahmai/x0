        "content": "To perform the division operation on each number in the \"Number\" column by 3 and output the results in a new column in Excel, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Insert a New Column**: First, insert a new column next to the \"Number\" column. You can label this new column as \"Result\" or \"Number_Divided_By_3\".\n\n2. **Enter the Formula**: In the first cell of this new column (let's say cell C2), enter the following formula:\n\n   ```\n   =A2/3\n   ```\n\n   This formula divides the value in cell A2 by 3.\n\n3. **Copy the Formula Down**: Click on the cell where you entered the formula (C2), and then drag the fill handle (a small square at the bottom-right corner of the cell) down to fill the rest of the column with the formula.\n\nNow, you have the results of the division operation in the new column.\n\nTo export the data as a JSON file, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Save the Excel File as CSV**: First, save your Excel file as a CSV file. Go to `File > Save As`, and select CSV (Comma delimited) as the file format.\n\n2. **Use a Script or Online Tool to Convert CSV to JSON**: There are multiple ways to convert CSV files to JSON format. You can use a script or an online tool. Here's a simple way using Python:\n\n   - Install the `pandas` library if you haven't already, using the command:\n\n     ```\n     pip install pandas\n     ```\n\n   - Use the following Python script to convert the CSV to JSON:\n\n     ```python\n     import pandas as pd\n\n     # Load the CSV file into a DataFrame\n     df = pd.read_csv('your_file.csv')\n\n     # Convert the DataFrame to JSON\n     json_data = df.to_json(orient='records')\n\n     # Save the JSON data to a file\n     with open('output.json', 'w') as json_file:\n         json_file.write(json_data)\n\n     print(\"Data has been successfully converted to JSON.\")\n     ```\n\n   Replace `'your_file.csv'` with the path to your CSV file.\n\n3. **Use Online Tools**: Alternatively, you can use online tools like \"CSV to JSON\" converters, where you upload your CSV file and download the JSON file.\n\nFollowing these steps will allow you to perform the division operation and export the results as a JSON file."
