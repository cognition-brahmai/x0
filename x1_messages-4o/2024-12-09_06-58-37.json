Here is my code:\n\n```python\nclass PassByReference:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.variable = 'Original'\n        self.change(self.variable)\n        print(self.variable)\n\n    def change(self, var):\n        var = 'Changed'\n```\n\nI want the code to output 'Changed' instead of 'Original'. How can I change my code to accomplish this?"

        "content": "In Python, everything is an object, and variables are references to these objects. However, when you pass a variable to a function, you are passing the reference to the object, not the variable itself. Therefore, if you reassign the parameter inside the function, you are changing the reference to point to a new object, not modifying the original object that was passed in.\n\nIn your code, you are passing a string to the `change` method. Strings are immutable in Python, meaning that once they are created, they cannot be changed. When you assign `var = 'Changed'`, you are simply changing the local reference `var` to point to a new string object, and the original `self.variable` remains unchanged.\n\nTo achieve the behavior you want, you can work with a mutable object, such as a list or dictionary. Here's an example using a list:\n\n```python\nclass PassByReference:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.variable = ['Original']\n        self.change(self.variable)\n        print(self.variable[0])\n\n    def change(self, var):\n        var[0] = 'Changed'\n\n# Create an instance of the class\npass_by_ref = PassByReference()\n```\n\nIn this code, `self.variable` is a list containing a single string. When you pass this list to the `change` method, you can modify the contents of the list (since lists are mutable), and the change will be reflected outside the function. The output will be `'Changed'` as you desired."
