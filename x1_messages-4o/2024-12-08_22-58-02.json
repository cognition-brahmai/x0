        "content": "Beavers belong to the family Castoridae, and there are two extant species: the North American beaver (Castor canadensis) and the Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber). Their scientific classification is as follows:\n\n- Kingdom: Animalia\n- Phylum: Chordata\n- Class: Mammalia\n- Order: Rodentia\n- Family: Castoridae\n- Genus: Castor\n- Species: Castor canadensis (North American beaver), Castor fiber (Eurasian beaver)\n\nTo find this information using Shell commands, you can use tools like `curl` or `wget` to fetch data from online resources or use command-line utilities like `grep` or `awk` to parse the data. Here's an example using `curl` and `grep` to fetch data from Wikipedia:\n\n```bash\n# Fetch the Wikipedia page for \"Beaver\" and search for the classification table\ncurl -s https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver | grep -A 10 \"Scientific classification\"\n```\n\nThis command uses `curl` to download the content of the Wikipedia page for \"Beaver\" and `grep` to search for the section containing \"Scientific classification\". The `-A 10` option tells `grep` to display 10 lines after the matching line, which should include the classification table.\n\nKeep in mind that the structure of web pages can change over time, so this command may need adjustments if the website's layout changes."
