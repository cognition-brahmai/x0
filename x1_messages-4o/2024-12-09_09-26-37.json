        "content": "Certainly! To find the number of permutations of a given string, you can write a program that calculates the factorial of the length of the string, and if there are any repeating characters, you divide by the factorial of the frequency of each repeating character. Here's a Python program to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport math\n\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n\ndef permutations_count(s):\n    # Count the frequency of each character in the string\n    freq = Counter(s)\n    \n    # Calculate the factorial of the length of the string\n    total_permutations = factorial(len(s))\n    \n    # Divide by the factorial of the frequency of each character\n    for char, count in freq.items():\n        total_permutations //= factorial(count)\n    \n    return total_permutations\n\n# Example usage\nstring = \"AABC\"\nresult = permutations_count(string)\nprint(f\"The number of permutations for the string '{string}' is: {result}\")\n```\n\n### How it Works:\n1. **Factorial Calculation**: The `factorial` function calculates the factorial of a number.\n2. **Character Frequency**: We use `Counter` from the `collections` module to calculate the frequency of each character in the string.\n3. **Permutations Calculation**: We first calculate the factorial of the length of the string, which gives us the permutations if all characters were unique. We then divide this by the factorial of the frequency of each character to account for duplicates.\n\nYou can run this program with any string to find the number of unique permutations it can have."
