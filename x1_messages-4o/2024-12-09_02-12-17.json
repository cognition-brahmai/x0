For instance, if I'm loading data from a source updated only on an hourly basis into my database, backfilling would just mean importing the same data repeatedly. This becomes particularly bothersome when I initiate a new hourly task, and it runs 'N' times for each missed hour, performing redundant work, before it starts running on the interval I specified. The only solution I can think of is using dynamic values as start_date, particularly datetime.now(), which is specifically advised against in the FAQ of the Apache Airflow documents. Is there a way to disable backfilling for a DAG, or should I go ahead and use the datetime.now() method?"

        "content": "To prevent Apache Airflow from backfilling DAG runs, you can use the `catchup` parameter in your DAG definition. By setting `catchup=False`, you can disable backfilling for that particular DAG. This will ensure that Airflow does not attempt to run tasks for past intervals that were missed.\n\nHere's how you can set it in your DAG:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import timedelta\nfrom airflow import DAG\nfrom airflow.operators.dummy_operator import DummyOperator\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndefault_args = {\n    'owner': 'airflow',\n    'depends_on_past': False,\n    'start_date': datetime(2023, 10, 25),\n    'email_on_failure': False,\n    'email_on_retry': False,\n    'retries': 1,\n    'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5),\n}\n\ndag = DAG(\n    'my_dag',\n    default_args=default_args,\n    description='A simple tutorial DAG',\n    schedule_interval=timedelta(hours=1),\n    catchup=False,  # This is the key to prevent backfilling\n)\n\nstart = DummyOperator(task_id='start', retries=3, dag=dag)\nend = DummyOperator(task_id='end', retries=3, dag=dag)\n\nstart >> end\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **`catchup=False`:** This parameter tells Airflow not to backfill any missed DAG runs. It will only execute the DAG for the most recent schedule interval.\n\n- **`start_date`:** Even though you're advised against using `datetime.now()`, setting a fixed `start_date` is the best practice. This provides a clear and consistent point from which the DAG should start running. The DAG will not run for any intervals before this date.\n\nBy following this approach, you can avoid the unnecessary backfilling of DAG runs without having to use dynamic `start_date` values like `datetime.now()`."
