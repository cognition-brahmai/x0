I'm currently facing a problem wherein the test stops running as soon as it finds a value that doesn't match up when using \"assert\" or \"pytest.fail\". Is there a method to make the test continue running and report on all values that don't match?"

        "content": "Yes, you can perform multiple assertions in a single pytest test and continue running the test even if some assertions fail. In pytest, this can be achieved using the `pytest` plugin called `pytest-check`, which allows for soft assertions. Soft assertions let the test continue running after a failure, collecting all assertion failures and reporting them at the end of the test.\n\nHere's how you can use `pytest-check` to achieve this:\n\n1. **Install `pytest-check`:**\n\n   You need to install the `pytest-check` plugin first. You can do this using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pytest-check\n   ```\n\n2. **Use `pytest-check` in your tests:**\n\n   Instead of using the standard `assert` statement, use `check.equal` or `check.is_true` to make assertions. Here's an example of how to use it in your selenium tests:\n\n   ```python\n   import pytest_check as check\n   from selenium import webdriver\n\n   def test_multiple_assertions():\n       driver = webdriver.Chrome()\n       driver.get(\"https://example.com\")\n\n       # Perform multiple assertions\n       check.is_true(\"Example Domain\" in driver.title, \"Title does not contain 'Example Domain'\")\n       check.equal(driver.find_element_by_tag_name(\"h1\").text, \"Example Domain\", \"Heading is incorrect\")\n       check.is_true(driver.find_element_by_id(\"non_existent_id\").is_displayed(), \"Element should be displayed\")\n\n       # Continue with more checks as needed\n       # ...\n\n       driver.quit()\n   ```\n\n3. **Run your tests:**\n\n   When you run your tests using pytest, all failed checks will be reported at the end of the test.\n\n   ```bash\n   pytest your_test_file.py\n   ```\n\nBy using `pytest-check`, you can accumulate all assertion failures and report them together, making it easier to see all the issues in your test at once. Remember to handle any exceptions that might be raised during element interaction, especially when dealing with non-existent elements, as this would stop the test execution as well."
