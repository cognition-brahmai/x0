        "content": "Certainly! Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep neural networks that have been highly effective in tasks like image recognition. Below is a simple example of a CNN implemented using the Keras library in Python. This example uses the popular CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras import datasets, layers, models\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset\n(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = datasets.cifar10.load_data()\n\n# Normalize pixel values to be between 0 and 1\ntrain_images, test_images = train_images / 255.0, test_images / 255.0\n\n# Define the CNN model\nmodel = models.Sequential([\n    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),\n    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\n    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\n    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\n    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\n    layers.Flatten(),\n    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),\n    layers.Dense(10)\n])\n\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',\n              loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),\n              metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Train the model\nhistory = model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, \n                    validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))\n\n# Evaluate the model\ntest_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2)\nprint(f'Test accuracy: {test_acc}')\n\n# Plot training and validation accuracy\nplt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='accuracy')\nplt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='val_accuracy')\nplt.xlabel('Epoch')\nplt.ylabel('Accuracy')\nplt.ylim([0, 1])\nplt.legend(loc='lower right')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded and the pixel values are normalized to the range [0, 1].\n\n2. **Model Architecture**: The model is a simple CNN with three convolutional layers, each followed by a max pooling layer, and two fully connected layers at the end.\n\n3. **Compilation**: The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy as the loss function. Accuracy is used as the metric.\n\n4. **Training**: The model is trained for 10 epochs, and both training and validation accuracies are recorded.\n\n5. **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated on the test dataset, and the test accuracy is printed.\n\n6. **Visualization**: The training and validation accuracies are plotted to visualize the model's performance over epochs.\n\nThis CNN model can achieve a level of accuracy that often surpasses human performance in image recognition tasks on large datasets."
