        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to the use of CUDA's dynamic parallelism feature, which requires certain linking steps because it involves more complex interactions between host and device code. Here's a step-by-step guide to resolving this issue:\n\n### Steps to Resolve the Issue\n\n1. **Ensure Proper Compilation with NVCC:**\n   When using dynamic parallelism, ensure that the entire project is compiled with `nvcc` since it handles both host and device code seamlessly. This includes both `.cu` and `.cpp` files.\n\n2. **Use Correct Compiler Flags:**\n   Make sure you are using the correct flags for compiling and linking:\n\n   - `-rdc=true` enables relocatable device code, which is necessary for dynamic parallelism.\n   - `-lcudadevrt` links against the CUDA device runtime, which is required for dynamic parallelism.\n\n3. **Modify Compilation Commands:**\n   Here is the revised command sequence to compile and link your code:\n\n   - Compile the CUDA file with relocatable device code enabled:\n     ```bash\n     nvcc -arch=sm_35 -rdc=true -c file.cu -o file.o\n     ```\n\n   - Compile the C++ host file using `nvcc` to handle CUDA runtime dependencies:\n     ```bash\n     nvcc -arch=sm_35 -rdc=true -c main.cpp -o main.o\n     ```\n\n   - Link both object files together, including the necessary CUDA libraries:\n     ```bash\n     nvcc -arch=sm_35 -rdc=true file.o main.o -o output_executable -lcudadevrt -lcudart\n     ```\n\n4. **Ensure Correct Compute Capability:**\n   The `-arch=sm_35` flag is used for the K20x card, but make sure this is the correct compute capability for your specific GPU. For newer GPUs, you might need to adjust this.\n\n5. **Check CUDA Toolkit Version Compatibility:**\n   Ensure that your CUDA Toolkit version supports the dynamic parallelism and capabilities you are trying to use, as older versions might not fully support these features.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Environment Variables:**\n  Ensure that your environment variables such as `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` are correctly set to include the CUDA toolkit and libraries.\n\n- **CUDA Sample Codes:**\n  Test by running some sample codes provided by NVIDIA in the CUDA toolkit to ensure your setup is correct.\n\n- **Driver Updates:**\n  Check if your NVIDIA drivers are up to date, as outdated drivers can sometimes cause unexpected issues.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `undefined reference to '__cudaRegisterLinkedBinary'` error and successfully compile and link your C++ and CUDA code with dynamic parallelism."
