We are able to sync the code and edit it without any issues using Pycharm on various platforms like Windows and Linux. However, one of the computers, which is running the Mac version of Pycharm, is encountering an \"Unresolved reference\" error all over the code on almost every import, except Python's built-in libraries (for instance, 'import datetime' is working). Because most of the imports are not recognized, code completion and navigation through goto->declaration and others is not working. Is there any known issue with the Mac version of Pycharm and does anyone know how to solve this?"

        "content": "The \"Unresolved reference\" error in PyCharm is typically related to issues with the Python interpreter configuration or the project's virtual environment. Here are some steps you can follow to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check the Python Interpreter:**\n   - Open your PyCharm project.\n   - Navigate to `File > Settings` (or `PyCharm > Preferences` on macOS).\n   - Go to `Project: [Your Project Name] > Python Interpreter`.\n   - Ensure that the correct Python interpreter is selected. If you are using a virtual environment, make sure it's activated.\n\n2. **Configure the Project SDK:**\n   - Sometimes, the project SDK might not be set correctly. Go to `File > Project Structure` and ensure the correct SDK is selected under `Project Settings > Project`.\n\n3. **Recreate the Virtual Environment:**\n   - If using a virtual environment, try recreating it. Delete the existing `venv` (or equivalent) folder, then recreate it using:\n     ```\n     python3 -m venv venv\n     ```\n   - Activate the virtual environment:\n     ```\n     source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS\n     ```\n   - Reinstall the necessary packages:\n     ```\n     pip install -r requirements.txt\n     ```\n\n4. **Invalidate Caches and Restart:**\n   - Sometimes, invalidating caches can resolve issues. Go to `File > Invalidate Caches / Restart` and select `Invalidate and Restart`.\n\n5. **Check for PyCharm Updates:**\n   - Ensure that PyCharm is updated to the latest version, as there might be bug fixes that address this issue.\n\n6. **Inspect the `PYTHONPATH`:**\n   - Check if the `PYTHONPATH` is set correctly. You can add source roots by right-clicking on the directories in the Project view and selecting `Mark Directory as > Sources Root`.\n\n7. **Module Settings:**\n   - Ensure that the modules are correctly configured. Go to `File > Project Structure > Modules` and make sure each module has the right content roots and dependencies set.\n\n8. **Re-sync the Project:**\n   - Try deleting the `.idea` directory (which stores PyCharm settings) and re-importing the project to see if the issue resolves itself.\n\n9. **Check for Conflicting Plugins:**\n   - Sometimes, plugins can cause issues. Disable any plugins that might interfere with project resolution.\n\nIf none of these steps work, consider checking PyCharm's logs for any specific error messages that might give more insight into what's going wrong. You can find the logs under `Help > Show Log in Finder`."
