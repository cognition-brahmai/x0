        "content": "I am using the 'map' function in Python to recode values in a column of a Pandas dataframe. I pass a dictionary to this function, but I've noticed that if there's a value in the original series that is not explicitly in the dictionary, it gets recoded to NaN. Here is an example:\n\nI create a series `s`:\n\n```python\ns = pd.Series(['one','two','three','four'])\n```\n\nThe series is:\n\n```python\n0    one\n1    two\n2  three\n3   four\ndtype: object\n```\n\nBut, after applying the map using a dictionary `recodes`:\n\n```python\nrecodes = {'one':'A', 'two':'B', 'three':'C'}\ns.map(recodes)\n```\n\nThe returned series is:\n\n```python\n0      A\n1      B\n2      C\n3    NaN\ndtype: object\n```\n\nIs there a way to retain the original value in the series `s` if it is not in the `recodes` dictionary? I would prefer that if any element in series `s` is not in the `recodes` dictionary, it remains unchanged, and I would like the output to be:\n\n```python\n0      A\n1      B\n2      C\n3   four\ndtype: object\n```\n\nBut, I can't always anticipate all possible values that will be in the series I'm recoding as the data will be updated in the future and new values could appear. Is there a straightforward way to do this?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this by using the `map` method along with the `fillna` method to fill in the original values for any entries that are not found in the `recodes` dictionary. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Original series\ns = pd.Series(['one', 'two', 'three', 'four'])\n\n# Dictionary for recoding\nrecodes = {'one': 'A', 'two': 'B', 'three': 'C'}\n\n# Use map and fillna to retain original values for unmatched entries\nmapped_series = s.map(recodes).fillna(s)\n\nprint(mapped_series)\n```\n\nThis code will give you the desired output:\n\n```\n0      A\n1      B\n2      C\n3   four\ndtype: object\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n- `s.map(recodes)` attempts to map each value in the series `s` to a value in the `recodes` dictionary.\n- If a value isn't found in `recodes`, `map` will return `NaN` for that entry.\n- `fillna(s)` fills in those `NaN` values with the original values from `s`, effectively leaving them unchanged.\n\nThis way, any value not found in the dictionary will remain the same in the resultant series."
