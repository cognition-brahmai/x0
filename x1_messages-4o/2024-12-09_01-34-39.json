For instance, if I have a class 'SomeClass' defined as below: \n\n```python\nclass SomeClass:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.value = 0\n```\n\nand then create an instance of this class and assign a value to it:\n\n```python\nsomeObject = SomeClass()\nsomeObject.value = 12\n```\n\nThen I try to copy this instance to another object and modify the property:\n\n```python\nanotherObject = someObject\nanotherObject.value = 10\n```\n\nHowever, I find that the original property of 'someObject' gets modified when I print 'someObject.value', it prints '10'. I want 'anotherObject.value' to contain '10', but I want 'someObject.value' to still contain the original '12'. Is this possible in Python?"

        "content": "Yes, it is possible to copy an object in Python without copying its reference, and you can achieve this using the `copy` module. There are two types of copies you can make: a shallow copy and a deep copy.\n\n1. **Shallow Copy**: This creates a new object but does not recursively copy the objects that the original object references. For your class, since it doesn't contain complex objects within it, a shallow copy would work fine.\n\n2. **Deep Copy**: This creates a new object and recursively copies all objects found within the original object.\n\nFor your specific case, since `SomeClass` does not contain nested objects, a shallow copy will suffice. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nimport copy\n\nclass SomeClass:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.value = 0\n\n# Create an instance of SomeClass and set its value\nsomeObject = SomeClass()\nsomeObject.value = 12\n\n# Create a shallow copy of someObject\nanotherObject = copy.copy(someObject)\n\n# Modify the value of anotherObject\nanotherObject.value = 10\n\n# Output values to verify\nprint(\"someObject.value:\", someObject.value)  # This will print 12\nprint(\"anotherObject.value:\", anotherObject.value)  # This will print 10\n```\n\nIn this example, `anotherObject` is a shallow copy of `someObject`, so changes to `anotherObject.value` do not affect `someObject.value`. If your class later contains more complex structures (like lists or dictionaries), you might want to consider using `copy.deepcopy()` instead to ensure a full, independent copy of the original object."
