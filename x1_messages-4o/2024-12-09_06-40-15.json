I'm trying to employ pytest's assert introspection in this helper function to easily find differences in strings, especially those related to whitespace. However, I'm finding that the test report shows helpful information for asserts within the tests, but not for asserts within the helper. I tried a workaround where I output additional info with the assert but it didn't provide the desired result. I also tried a solution from a related question I found on Stack Overflow which asked to register the helper function for assert rewrite using `pytest.register_assert_rewrite('helpers.my_helper')`, but it didn't work for me. How can I enable pytest assert introspection within the helper file?"

        "content": "To enable pytest's assert introspection within helper functions located in a separate module, a few steps need to be taken to ensure that pytest recognizes these functions for assert rewriting. Here are the steps you should follow:\n\n1. **Ensure Proper Naming and Structure:**\n   - Make sure your helper module is structured correctly and is being imported properly in your test files.\n\n2. **Register the Helper Module for Assert Rewrite:**\n   - Use `pytest.register_assert_rewrite()` in your test package's `__init__.py` file. This ensures that the assert statements in the specified module are rewritten by pytest for better introspection.\n\n   For example, if your helper functions are in a module named `helpers.py`, you should have the following in your `__init__.py`:\n\n   ```python\n   import pytest\n   pytest.register_assert_rewrite('your_package_name.helpers')\n   ```\n\n   Ensure that `'your_package_name.helpers'` matches the import path of your helper module.\n\n3. **Structure Your Project Correctly:**\n   - Make sure your project is structured so that pytest can find and rewrite the asserts in your helper module. Your directory structure might look something like this:\n\n   ```\n   your_project/\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 your_package/\n   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 helpers.py\n   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 test_your_module.py\n   ```\n\n4. **Call Helper Functions Properly:**\n   - When calling helper functions in your test, ensure they are correctly imported from your helper module. For instance:\n\n   ```python\n   from your_package.helpers import your_helper_function\n\n   def test_example():\n       your_helper_function()\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify the Helper Module is Being Imported:**\n   - Double-check that your helper module is being imported correctly in your test files. Sometimes an incorrect import can lead to the helper module not being recognized for assert rewriting.\n\n6. **Use `-p no:doctest` Option:**\n   - If you have doctests in your helper module, consider running pytest with the `-p no:doctest` option to avoid conflicts between doctest and pytest's assertion rewriting.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to see detailed assert introspection output for assertions within your helper functions, similar to what you get in your main test functions. If the issue persists, ensure there are no syntax errors or misconfigurations in your project setup."
