Here is the code I was trying to convert to Python:\n\n```python\nfor( int i = 0; cond...; i++)\n  if cond...\n    i++; //to skip an run-through\n```\n\nI tried the following in Python but it doesn't work as expected. It doesn't skip the run-through when the condition is met.\n\n```python\nfor i in range(whatever):\n  if cond... :\n    i += 1\n```\n\nHow can I achieve this in Python?"

        "content": "In Python, the `for` loop using `range` does not allow you to modify the loop variable `i` within the loop to affect iteration. Instead, you can use a `while` loop to achieve similar behavior where you can control the increment of the loop variable manually. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve the same effect:\n\n```python\ni = 0\nwhile i < whatever:\n    if cond:  # Replace this with your actual condition\n        i += 1  # Increment to skip the next run-through\n        continue  # Skip the rest of the loop body and proceed to the next iteration\n    # Your loop logic here\n    i += 1  # Increment after processing\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- The loop starts with `i = 0`.\n- The `while` loop continues as long as `i < whatever`.\n- If the condition `cond` is met, `i` is incremented by 1 to skip the next run-through, and `continue` is used to skip the rest of the loop body and jump to the next iteration.\n- The loop variable `i` is incremented at the end of the loop body to move to the next iteration unless the `continue` statement is executed.\n\nThis approach gives you full control over the loop variable `i`, allowing you to skip iterations based on your condition."
