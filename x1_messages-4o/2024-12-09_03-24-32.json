I've already installed a self-signed root ca cert into Debian's `/usr/share/ca-certificates/local` and installed them with `sudo dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificates`. While `true | gnutls-cli mysite.local` and `true | openssl s_client -connect mysite.local:443` work fine, the Python2 and Python3 Requests modules keep returning a SSLError with a message of \"bad handshake: Error([('SSL routines', 'ssl3_get_server_certificate', 'certificate verify failed')],)\". Why does Python ignore the system ca-certificates bundle, and how do I integrate it?"

        "content": "To resolve the SSLError you're encountering with Python's Requests module on Debian/Ubuntu, you need to ensure that Python's SSL library is configured to use the system CA certificates. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you integrate the system CA certificates into Python's Requests module:\n\n1. **Verify CA Certificate Installation:**\n   Make sure your custom CA certificate is correctly installed in the system's CA store. You mentioned using `sudo dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificates`, which is the right approach. Verify that your CA certificate is listed in `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`.\n\n2. **Update the `certifi` Package:**\n   Python's Requests module relies on the `certifi` package, which comes with its own CA bundle. You might need to update or override this package to use the system CA certificates.\n\n   - **Option 1: Update `certifi` with system CA certificates:**\n     You can update the `certifi` package to point to the system CA certificates by setting the `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` environment variable to `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`:\n\n     ```bash\n     export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\n     ```\n\n     Add this line to your shell's configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`) to make it persistent across sessions.\n\n   - **Option 2: Install `certifi` with system CA certificates:**\n     Another method is to install a Python package that configures `certifi` to use system CA certificates. You can use `certifi-system`.\n\n     First, uninstall the existing `certifi` package:\n\n     ```bash\n     pip uninstall certifi\n     ```\n\n     Then, install `certifi-system`:\n\n     ```bash\n     pip install certifi-system\n     ```\n\n     This package will automatically configure the `certifi` to use the system CA certificates.\n\n3. **Test the Configuration:**\n   After making these changes, test the Requests module to ensure it can successfully verify your server's certificate:\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n\n   try:\n       response = requests.get('https://mysite.local')\n       print(response.status_code)\n   except requests.exceptions.SSLError as e:\n       print(f\"SSL error: {e}\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Fallback: Disable SSL Verification (not recommended):**\n   If none of the above solutions work and you're in a development environment or trust the connections, you can disable SSL verification as a last resort (not recommended for production):\n\n   ```python\n   response = requests.get('https://mysite.local', verify=False)\n   ```\n\n   Note: Disabling SSL verification can expose you to security risks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to configure Python's Requests module to recognize and use the system CA certificates on Debian/Ubuntu."
