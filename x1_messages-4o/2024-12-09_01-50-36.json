        "content": "In Python, I frequently need to check if a number variable `number` has a value or not. I often use `if number` to accomplish this, but the issue arises when the number could be zero. I currently resolve this by using `if number or number == 0`. Is there a smarter or more efficient way to check if a value is zero or not null? I've considered just checking if the value is a number with a function, but I still end up needing to check with `if number and is_number(number)`. Is there a more effective method to achieve this?"

        "content": "When you're working with a variable in Python and you need to check if it has a value without mistakenly treating `0` as a \"no value\" condition, you have a few options depending on the context of your application.\n\nOne of the most straightforward and efficient methods is to check if the variable is not `None`. This approach makes it clear that you're interested in whether the variable has been assigned a meaningful value, not just whether it evaluates to `True` in a boolean context. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nif number is not None:\n    # number has a value and can be 0\n    # Your logic here\n```\n\nThis condition will evaluate to `True` for any number, including `0`, as long as `number` is not `None`. It's a clear and concise way to check if `number` has been assigned a value.\n\nIf you need to ensure that the value is specifically a numeric type (e.g., int or float), you can combine this with a type check using `isinstance()`:\n\n```python\nif number is not None and isinstance(number, (int, float)):\n    # number is a numeric type and not None\n    # Your logic here\n```\n\nThis ensures that `number` is not only assigned but also a valid numeric value. This approach is efficient and leverages Python's built-in capabilities for type checking."
