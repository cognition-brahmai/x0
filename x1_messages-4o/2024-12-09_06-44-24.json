I am unsure about whether the text data I feed into the model needs to be pre-processed like in any standard Natural Language Processing (NLP) task. Should I perform stemming, remove low frequency words, and de-capitalization on the text data, or should I simply pass the raw text to `transformers.BertTokenizer`?"

        "content": "When using BERT or other transformer-based models, especially when fine-tuning, it's generally recommended to pass the raw text to `transformers.BertTokenizer` without performing traditional pre-processing steps like stemming, removing low frequency words, or de-capitalization. Here's why:\n\n1. **Tokenization:** BERT's tokenizer (WordPiece tokenizer) is designed to handle various linguistic features and subword tokenization efficiently. It can manage capitalization and word variations effectively.\n\n2. **Case Sensitivity:** BERT models come in two versions: cased and uncased. If you're using a cased model, maintaining the original casing of the text is important as the model was trained to recognize case differences. For uncased models, the tokenizer will handle lowercasing.\n\n3. **Subword Units:** BERT uses subword units, which means it can capture the meaning of rare words by breaking them into more common subwords. Therefore, removing low-frequency words is unnecessary and could potentially harm the model's ability to understand nuanced meanings.\n\n4. **Semantic Context:** Stemming might alter the words in a way that can change their meaning or semantic context. Since BERT is designed to capture contextual information, it's better to provide the text as is.\n\n5. **Pre-processing:** Minimal pre-processing is generally sufficient, such as removing extraneous whitespace or special characters that aren't meaningful in your context. However, specific tasks might require additional pre-processing based on the data characteristics.\n\nIn summary, for BERT embeddings, it's typically best to use the raw text and leverage the tokenizer provided by the library to prepare the data for the model. This approach ensures that you retain the rich semantic and syntactic information that BERT is designed to capture."
