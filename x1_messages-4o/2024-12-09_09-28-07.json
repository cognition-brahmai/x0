Let's go through a simple example where you have an array of objects, and you want to read and modify these objects.\n\nLet's assume you have a class `Record` that represents the structure of each record. Here's a basic implementation:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nnamespace RecordModification\n{\n    // Define a simple Record class\n    public class Record\n    {\n        public int Id { get; set; }\n        public string Name { get; set; }\n        \n        public Record(int id, string name)\n        {\n            Id = id;\n            Name = name;\n        }\n\n        public override string ToString()\n        {\n            return $\"ID: {Id}, Name: {Name}\";\n        }\n    }\n\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            // Initialize an array of Record objects\n            Record[] records = new Record[]\n            {\n                new Record(1, \"Alice\"),\n                new Record(2, \"Bob\"),\n                new Record(3, \"Charlie\")\n            };\n\n            // Display records before modification\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Records before modification:\");\n            DisplayRecords(records);\n\n            // Modify a record\n            ModifyRecord(records, 2, \"Bobby\");\n\n            // Display records after modification\n            Console.WriteLine(\"\\nRecords after modification:\");\n            DisplayRecords(records);\n        }\n\n        // Method to display all records\n        static void DisplayRecords(Record[] records)\n        {\n            foreach (var record in records)\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(record);\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Method to modify a record by Id\n        static void ModifyRecord(Record[] records, int id, string newName)\n        {\n            foreach (var record in records)\n            {\n                if (record.Id == id)\n                {\n                    record.Name = newName;\n                    Console.WriteLine($\"\\nRecord with ID {id} modified.\");\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Record Class**: This class has two properties `Id` and `Name`. It also includes a constructor for easy initialization and an overridden `ToString` method for easy display of record information.\n\n2. **Main Method**: \n   - Initializes an array of `Record` objects.\n   - Displays the original records.\n   - Calls `ModifyRecord` to change a specific record.\n   - Displays the records after modification.\n\n3. **DisplayRecords Method**: Iterates over the array and prints each record.\n\n4. **ModifyRecord Method**: \n   - Accepts the array, an `id` to identify which record to modify, and the `newName` to update the record.\n   - Searches for the record with the specified `id` and modifies its `Name` property.\n\nThis example demonstrates how you can interact with an array of objects, reading and modifying them as needed. You can expand on this by adding more functionalities or working with more complex data structures as required."
