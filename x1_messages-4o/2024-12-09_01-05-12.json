Considering that each function requires a `cublasHandle_t`, is it better practice to reuse this handle instance as much as possible like a `Session`? Or, would the performance impact be so small that it would make more sense to reduce code complexity by having short-living handle instances and thus, create and destroy it continuously? Here is a sample of the code I'm referring to:\n\n```python\ncublasHandle_t handle;\ncublasCreate_v2(&handle);\ncublasDgemm_v2(handle, A_trans, B_trans, m, n, k, &alpha, d_A, lda, d_B, ldb, &beta, d_C, ldc);\ncublasDestroy_v2(handle);\n```"

        "content": "Reusing a `cublasHandle_t` across different calls can be advantageous in terms of performance and resource management. Here are some points to consider when deciding whether to reuse the handle or create and destroy it continuously:\n\n1. **Performance**: Creating and destroying a `cublasHandle_t` involves overhead. If you are performing multiple operations that require the use of a cuBLAS handle, it is generally more efficient to create the handle once, reuse it across all operations, and destroy it at the end. This reduces the overhead associated with repeated creation and destruction.\n\n2. **Resource Management**: Each `cublasHandle_t` consumes system resources. By reusing the handle, you minimize resource allocation and deallocation, which can be beneficial, especially in resource-constrained environments.\n\n3. **Code Complexity**: While reusing a handle might slightly increase the complexity of your code, it is often not significant compared to the potential performance benefits. You can manage the handle's lifecycle in a well-defined section of your code to keep it organized.\n\n4. **Best Practices**: Similar to managing sessions or database connections, it is a common practice to initialize resources once, use them as needed, and then clean up at the end. This pattern is often more efficient and leads to cleaner code.\n\n5. **Use Case**: If your application requires multiple consecutive calls to cuBLAS functions, it is advisable to reuse the handle. However, if you have a single, isolated call and the handle's lifecycle is short, the impact of creating and destroying it might be negligible.\n\nIn conclusion, for most scenarios where multiple cuBLAS operations are involved, reusing a `cublasHandle_t` is the better practice. It enhances performance by reducing overhead and simplifies resource management. If your application frequently uses cuBLAS, consider structuring your code to create the handle once at the beginning and destroy it at the end."
