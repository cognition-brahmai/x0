        "content": "Anencephaly is a congenital condition that affects the development of the brain and skull in a fetus. It occurs when the neural tube, which normally forms the brain and spinal cord, fails to close properly during early embryonic development. \nTo further explain the cause of anencephaly, let's use an anatomical diagram to illustrate the development of the neural tube in a developing fetus. As shown in the diagram below, the neural tube begins to form at the top of the embryo and grows towards the bottom. Eventually, the tube will close and form the brain and spinal cord.\n![Anatomy of neural tube development](neural-tube-development.png)\nHowever, in cases of anencephaly, the neural tube fails to close properly at the top of the embryo, resulting in the absence of a major portion of the brain and skull. This can lead to a variety of neurological and physical defects in affected infants.\nIn summary, anencephaly is caused by a failure of the neural tube to close properly during embryonic development, resulting in incomplete development of the brain and skull."

        "content": "Anencephaly is indeed a severe congenital condition characterized by the incomplete development of the brain and skull due to the failure of the neural tube to close properly during early embryonic development. This failure occurs at the cranial end of the neural tube, leading to the absence of a major portion of the brain, skull, and scalp. \n\nThe neural tube is a critical structure that forms very early in pregnancy, typically between the third and fourth weeks of gestation. It eventually develops into the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord. When the neural tube does not close properly at the top, it results in the condition known as anencephaly.\n\nKey points about anencephaly include:\n\n1. **Causes**: While the exact cause of anencephaly is not fully understood, it is believed to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Certain genetic mutations, maternal nutritional deficiencies (such as folic acid), and environmental exposures have been linked to an increased risk of neural tube defects.\n\n2. **Diagnosis**: Anencephaly can often be detected during pregnancy through prenatal screening tests such as ultrasound and maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) testing. These tests can reveal abnormalities in the development of the fetus.\n\n3. **Prognosis**: Unfortunately, anencephaly is a fatal condition. Infants born with anencephaly are usually stillborn or die shortly after birth due to the severe underdevelopment of their brain and vital structures needed for survival.\n\n4. **Prevention**: One of the most effective preventive measures is adequate intake of folic acid before conception and during early pregnancy. It is recommended that women of childbearing age take a daily supplement of folic acid to reduce the risk of neural tube defects.\n\nUnderstanding the development and closure of the neural tube is crucial for comprehending how conditions like anencephaly occur and how they can potentially be prevented through early intervention and proper prenatal care."
