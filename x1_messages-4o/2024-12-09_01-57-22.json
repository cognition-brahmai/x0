        "content": "In Python, the \"@\" symbol is used in several contexts:\n\n1. **Decorators**: The most common use of the \"@\" symbol is for decorators. A decorator is a special kind of function that can modify the behavior of another function or method. When you see the \"@\" symbol followed by a function name above another function definition, it's applying that decorator to the function. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   @my_decorator\n   def my_function():\n       pass\n   ```\n\n   Here, `my_decorator` is applied to `my_function`.\n\n2. **Matrix Multiplication**: In Python 3.5 and later, the \"@\" symbol is used as the infix operator for matrix multiplication, as specified in PEP 465. This provides a way to multiply matrices using a more intuitive syntax:\n\n   ```python\n   import numpy as np\n\n   a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n   b = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\n\n   result = a @ b\n   ```\n\n   In this example, `result` will be the result of the matrix multiplication of `a` and `b`.\n\n3. **Other Uses**: The \"@\" symbol can also appear in certain frameworks and libraries for other domain-specific purposes, such as in Django for signals or in Flask for routing and before-request functions.\n\nThese are the primary uses of the \"@\" symbol in Python, serving both to enhance functionality and improve code readability."
