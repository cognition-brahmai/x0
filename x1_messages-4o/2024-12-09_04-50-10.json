Can someone explain why Node.js requires Python? Does it use Python underneath its API?\n\nHere are the prerequisites listed in the README.md file:\n\n* GCC 4.2 or newer\n* Python 2.6 or 2.7\n* GNU Make 3.81 or newer\n* libexecinfo (FreeBSD and OpenBSD only)"

The reason for this lies in the build tools used by Node.js.\n\nNode.js uses a build system called **gyp**, which is a project generator tool that helps in creating native add-ons for Node.js. Gyp was originally developed for Google Chrome and is written in Python. Because of this, when you build Node.js from source, Python is required to execute the gyp scripts and generate the necessary build files (such as Makefiles or Visual Studio project files) for compiling the native components of Node.js.\n\nWhen you are installing Node.js using precompiled binaries (which is the most common method), Python is not needed because the binaries are already compiled and packaged for your platform. It's mainly when you're compiling from source or developing native modules that Python becomes necessary.\n\nIn summary, Python is a build-time dependency for Node.js when compiling from source, but it is not part of the Node.js runtime or its API."
