However, I am having trouble finding the coordinates of the bounding boxes when objects are detected. I have some code where I believe the bounding boxes are drawn and another piece where I am not sure what the output means. Could you help me understand how to retrieve the coordinates of the bounding boxes?\n\nHere is my relevant code:\n\n```python\n# The following processing is only for single image\ndetection_boxes = tf.squeeze(tensor_dict['detection_boxes'], [0])\ndetection_masks = tf.squeeze(tensor_dict['detection_masks'], [0])\n\n# Visualization of the results of detection.\nvis_util.visualize_boxes_and_labels_on_image_array(\n    image_np,\n    output_dict['detection_boxes'],\n    output_dict['detection_classes'],\n    output_dict['detection_scores'],\n    category_index,\n    instance_masks=output_dict.get('detection_masks'),\n    use_normalized_coordinates=True,\n    line_thickness=8)\nplt.figure(figsize=IMAGE_SIZE)\nplt.imshow(image_np)\n```\n\nWhen I print `output_dict['detection_boxes']`, I get the following output:\n\n```python\narray([[ 0.56213236,  0.2780568 ,  0.91445708,  0.69120586],\n       [ 0.56261235,  0.86368728,  0.59286624,  0.8893863 ],\n       [ 0.57073039,  0.87096912,  0.61292225,  0.90354401],\n       [ 0.51422435,  0.78449738,  0.53994244,  0.79437423],\n       ...\n       [ 0.32784131,  0.5461576 ,  0.36972913,  0.56903434],\n       [ 0.03005961,  0.02714229,  0.47211722,  0.44683522],\n       [ 0.43143299, 0.09211366,  0.58121657,  0.3509962 ]], dtype=float32)\n```\n\nCan you explain what these numbers represent and how I can get the bounding box coordinates?"

        "content": "Certainly! The `output_dict['detection_boxes']` array contains the coordinates of the bounding boxes for detected objects in your image. Each row in this array corresponds to one bounding box, and the numbers represent the normalized coordinates of the bounding boxes.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what each value in a row represents:\n\n- The first value is the `ymin` (the top of the box).\n- The second value is the `xmin` (the left side of the box).\n- The third value is the `ymax` (the bottom of the box).\n- The fourth value is the `xmax` (the right side of the box).\n\nThese coordinates are normalized, meaning they are expressed as a fraction of the width and height of the image. To convert these normalized coordinates to pixel coordinates, you need to multiply them by the width and height of the image respectively.\n\nHere's how you can convert these to pixel values:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Assuming image_np is your image in numpy array format\nimage_height, image_width, _ = image_np.shape\n\n# Example for converting the first bounding box\nfor box in output_dict['detection_boxes']:\n    ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax = box\n\n    # Convert to pixel coordinates\n    (left, right, top, bottom) = (xmin * image_width, xmax * image_width,\n                                  ymin * image_height, ymax * image_height)\n\n    print(f\"Bounding box pixel coordinates: left={left}, right={right}, top={top}, bottom={bottom}\")\n```\n\nThis code will give you the pixel coordinates for each bounding box, which you can use for further processing or visualization. You can loop over all detected bounding boxes as shown to get the coordinates for each one."
