The program should be designed to perform multiple-step reasoning to accomplish this task.\nHere is an excel table to assist with the program development:\n| Statement 1                         | Statement 2                                    |\n| -----------------------------------| -----------------------------------------------|\n| My preferred pastime is listening  | During my free time, I indulge in reading books |\n|                                     |                                                 | \nAdditionally, here is a sample code in C++ that can be modified and utilized for this task using the excel table:\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\nusing namespace std;\nint main()\n{\n    string statement1 = \"My preferred pastime is listening\";\n    string statement2 = \"During my free time, I indulge in reading books\";\n    string conjunction = \"and\";\n    string combinedStatement = statement1 + \" \" + conjunction + \" \" + statement2;\n    cout << combinedStatement << endl;\n    return 0;\n}"

        "content": "To develop a C++ program that connects two statements using a syntactic conjunction to form a grammatically correct sentence, you can use the given Excel table to extract the statements and apply a conjunction to them. Here\u2019s how you can modify your sample code to achieve this:\n\n### Steps to Implement the Program:\n\n1. **Read Data from the Excel Table:**\n   - Since Excel file reading requires additional libraries, for the sake of simplicity, let's assume we're manually inputting the statements into the program. In a more advanced scenario, you could use a library like `xlnt` or `libxls` to read Excel files.\n\n2. **Combine the Statements with a Conjunction:**\n   - Use a conjunction like \"and\" to combine the statements, ensuring the sentence is grammatically correct.\n\n3. **Print the Combined Statement:**\n\nHere's the updated C++ code:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main()\n{\n    // Manually inputted statements from the Excel table\n    string statement1 = \"My preferred pastime is listening to music\";\n    string statement2 = \"During my free time, I indulge in reading books\";\n    \n    // Choosing a conjunction\n    string conjunction = \"and\";\n    \n    // Capitalize the first letter of the second statement to maintain grammatical correctness\n    // Assuming the second statement is part of a single sentence\n    statement2[0] = tolower(statement2[0]);\n\n    // Combine the statements\n    string combinedStatement = statement1 + \" \" + conjunction + \" \" + statement2 + \".\";\n    \n    // Output the combined statement\n    cout << combinedStatement << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Statement Variables:** The statements are stored in `statement1` and `statement2`.\n- **Conjunction:** The conjunction \"and\" is used to connect the two statements.\n- **Formatting:** The first letter of `statement2` is converted to lowercase to ensure grammatical flow within the sentence, assuming the sentence continuation style.\n- **Output:** The combined statement is displayed as a single, coherent sentence.\n\n### Further Enhancements:\n\nFor more dynamic and flexible code:\n- Consider reading data directly from an Excel file using a C++ library if needed for larger datasets.\n- Implement a function to handle different conjunctions and formatting based on sentence structure requirements.\n\nThis code provides a basic framework to combine two statements using a conjunction, and you can expand it further according to your needs."
