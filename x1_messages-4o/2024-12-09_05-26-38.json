I have tried the following code but it doesn't work as expected. \n\n```python\nclass Parent(object):\n    foobar = [\"hello\"]\n\nclass Child(Parent):\n    # This does not work\n    foobar = foobar.extend([\"world\"])\n```\n\nI want the result to be `Child.foobar = [\"hello\", \"world\"]`. I have also tried the following code, but it appends \"world\" to the list every time I instantiate an instance of Child, which is not what I want.\n\n```python\nclass Child(Parent):\n    def __init__(self):\n      type(self).foobar.extend([\"world\"])\n```\n\nI tried modifying it to the following, but I still need to instantiate an instance of Child before it works, which is not ideal.\n\n```python\nclass Child(Parent):\n    def __init__(self):\n      if type(self).foobar.count(\"world\") < 1:\n          type(self).foobar.extend([\"world\"])\n```\n\nIs there a better way to achieve this?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired behavior of modifying a class variable in a child class without needing to instantiate an instance of the class, you can do it during the class definition itself. You can accomplish this by defining the class variable in the `Child` class after the class definition. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nclass Parent(object):\n    foobar = [\"hello\"]\n\nclass Child(Parent):\n    pass\n\n# Modify the class variable after class definition\nChild.foobar = Parent.foobar + [\"world\"]\n\n# Test the output\nprint(Child.foobar)  # Output: ['hello', 'world']\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that `Child.foobar` is set to `[\"hello\", \"world\"]` immediately upon class definition, without needing to instantiate the class. It also keeps `Parent.foobar` unchanged, as the modification is applied only to the `Child` class."
