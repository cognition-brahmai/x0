For example, given the input `intersperse(666, [\"once\", \"upon\", \"a\", 90, None, \"time\"])`, the desired output would be `[\"once\", 666, \"upon\", 666, \"a\", 666, 90, 666, None, 666, \"time\"]`."

        "content": "A Pythonic way to achieve this is to use list comprehensions along with the `zip` function. Here's a function `intersperse` that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef intersperse(element, lst):\n    if not lst:\n        return lst\n    # Create pairs of the list elements and the interspersing element\n    interspersed = [val for pair in zip(lst, [element] * (len(lst) - 1)) for val in pair]\n    # Add the last element of the original list as it's not included in the zip\n    interspersed.append(lst[-1])\n    return interspersed\n\n# Example usage\nresult = intersperse(666, [\"once\", \"upon\", \"a\", 90, None, \"time\"])\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We use the `zip` function to pair each element of the list with the interspersing element, except the last element.\n- The list comprehension `[val for pair in zip(lst, [element] * (len(lst) - 1)) for val in pair]` flattens these pairs into a single list.\n- Finally, we append the last element of the original list to complete the sequence.\n\nThis approach is both concise and efficient, adhering to Pythonic principles."
