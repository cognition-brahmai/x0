However, you can achieve this using the `re` module, which provides regex functionality. The `re.escape()` function can be used to escape all non-alphanumeric characters in a string, which effectively escapes special characters.\n\nHere's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\noriginal_string = 'I\\'m \"stuck\" :\\\\'\nescaped_string = re.escape(original_string)\n\nprint(escaped_string)\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n\n```\nI\\'m\\ \\\"stuck\\\"\\ :\\\\\n```\n\nNote that `re.escape()` is generally used for escaping characters so that they can be used in a regular expression pattern, but it can be used for your purpose as well if you need to escape all special characters in a string."
