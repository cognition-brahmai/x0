        "content": "When using Matplotlib within Django-Celery tasks, it's important to ensure that memory is properly managed to prevent memory leaks. Matplotlib can consume a significant amount of memory, especially if figures are not properly closed or if resources are not released. Here are some steps you can take to release memory after creating Matplotlib figures:\n\n1. **Close Figures Explicitly:**\n   After generating and saving your plot, explicitly close the figure using `plt.close()`. This helps in releasing the memory associated with the figure.\n\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n   def create_plot():\n       fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n       ax.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])\n       fig.savefig('plot.png')\n       plt.close(fig)  # Close the figure to release memory\n   ```\n\n2. **Use `gc.collect()`:**\n   After closing the figures, you can use Python's garbage collector to ensure that any unreferenced objects are cleaned up.\n\n   ```python\n   import gc\n\n   def create_plot():\n       fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n       ax.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])\n       fig.savefig('plot.png')\n       plt.close(fig)\n       gc.collect()  # Trigger garbage collection\n   ```\n\n3. **Avoid Using Interactive Mode:**\n   If you're running Matplotlib in an environment where the interactive mode is enabled, it might retain references to figures. Ensure that interactive mode is off.\n\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n   plt.ioff()  # Turn off interactive mode\n   ```\n\n4. **Delete References:**\n   Ensure that you delete any references to the figure or axes if you no longer need them.\n\n   ```python\n   del fig, ax  # Delete references to the figure and axes\n   ```\n\n5. **Use `Agg` Backend:**\n   If you're generating plots without displaying them (like in a web service), consider using a non-interactive backend like `Agg`.\n\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib\n   matplotlib.use('Agg')  # Use the 'Agg' backend for non-GUI environments\n   ```\n\n6. **Profile Memory Usage:**\n   Use a memory profiler to pinpoint where your memory usage is increasing. Tools like `memory_profiler` can be helpful.\n\n7. **Optimize Plot Complexity:**\n   If possible, reduce the complexity of your plots (fewer data points, simpler graphics) to decrease memory usage.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to mitigate memory usage when generating Matplotlib figures in your Django-Celery tasks."
