        "content": "Your Go program is mostly correct for solving the given equation. However, it's important to remember that, like in mathematics, Go follows the order of operations, also known as BODMAS/BIDMAS (Brackets, Orders (i.e., powers and square roots, etc.), Division and Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction). According to this order, multiplication is performed before addition and subtraction.\n\nLet's break down your equation:\n\n- Start with the multiplication: \\(5 * 2 = 10\\).\n- Then perform the subtraction: \\(3 - 10 = -7\\).\n- Finally, perform the addition: \\(10 + (-7) = 3\\).\n\nYour code correctly calculates this using Go's default order of operations. Here's your code as is:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc main() {\n    answer := 10 + 3 - 5 * 2\n    fmt.Println(\"The answer is:\", answer)\n}\n```\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output:\n\n```\nThe answer is: 3\n```\n\nIf you want to explicitly define the order of operations (though not necessary in this simple case), you could use parentheses:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc main() {\n    answer := 10 + (3 - (5 * 2))\n    fmt.Println(\"The answer is:\", answer)\n}\n```\n\nThis will give you the same result, ensuring clarity in more complex expressions. For this equation, however, your original code is perfectly fine."
