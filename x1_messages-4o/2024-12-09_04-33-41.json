To resolve this issue, you need to install `libmemcached-dev` on your Ubuntu system. You can do this by running the following command:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install libmemcached-dev\n```\n\nAfter installing `libmemcached-dev`, try installing `pylibmc` again using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install pylibmc\n```\n\nThis should resolve the issue, and the installation should proceed successfully. If you encounter any other errors, make sure that your system's package lists are updated and all dependencies are correctly installed."
