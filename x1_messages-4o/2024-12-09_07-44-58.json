        "content": "To achieve the desired output in reStructuredText with properly nested lists, you need to ensure that the nested list is indented correctly to indicate its relationship to the parent list item. In your case, the nested list items need to be indented under the parent list item. Here's how you can structure your reStructuredText code:\n\n```rst\n1. X\n   a. U\n   b. V\n   c. W\n2. Y\n3. Z\n```\n\nMake sure the nested list items (`a.`, `b.`, `c.`) are indented consistently under the main list item (`1. X`). The amount of indentation should be consistent for all nested items, and it should be more than the indentation of the parent list item. In this example, two spaces are used for indentation, but you can adjust this as needed, ensuring consistency throughout the document."
