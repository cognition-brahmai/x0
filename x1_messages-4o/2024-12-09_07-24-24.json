You can do this by running:\n   ```\n   pip show pylint\n   ```\n\n3. **Uninstall Pylint**: To uninstall `pylint`, run the following command:\n   ```\n   pip uninstall pylint\n   ```\n   Confirm the uninstallation when prompted.\n\n4. **Verify Uninstallation**: You can verify if `pylint` has been removed by running:\n   ```\n   pip show pylint\n   ```\n   If `pylint` is uninstalled, this command should return no results.\n\n5. **Reinstall Pylint (Optional)**: If you need to use `pylint` with updated Python 3 semantics, you can reinstall it. Make sure that the version you install is compatible with Python 3.5.2. Use:\n   ```\n   pip install pylint\n   ```\n\n6. **Check Version**: After installation, ensure you have the correct version installed by running:\n   ```\n   pylint --version\n   ```\n\n7. **Update Visual Studio Code Settings**: Ensure that Visual Studio Code is using the correct Python interpreter and has the updated `pylint` path. You can select the correct interpreter in the bottom-left corner of Visual Studio Code.\n\n8. **Restart Visual Studio Code**: Sometimes, changes require restarting Visual Studio Code to take effect.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to address the issues caused by the outdated `pylint` version in your Visual Studio Code setup."
