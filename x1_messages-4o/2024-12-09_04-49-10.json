When I use the following code to create an output image, the quality of the red text in the image is really awful. The images don't have this issue when saved with GIMP or Photoshop. Can someone explain why this is happening and how it can be fixed?\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\nim = Image.open('/path/to/cover_1.jpg')\nim.save('/path/to/cover_2.jpg', format='JPEG', quality=100)\n```\n\nInput: https://s23.postimg.cc/8bks3x5p7/cover_1.jpg\nOutput: https://s23.postimg.cc/68ey9zva3/cover_2.jpg"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing with the JPEG image quality when using the PIL library (now known as Pillow) can be attributed to several factors related to JPEG compression and how the library handles image saving. Here are some potential reasons and solutions:\n\n1. **JPEG Compression**: JPEG is a lossy compression format, which means some quality is always lost when saving an image in this format. Even at the maximum quality setting (100), some artifacts can appear, especially around areas with high contrast, like text.\n\n2. **Subsampling**: By default, some libraries use chroma subsampling when saving JPEGs, which reduces the resolution of the color information in the image. This can lead to noticeable artifacts around colored text. You can try disabling chroma subsampling like this:\n\n   ```python\n   im.save('/path/to/cover_2.jpg', format='JPEG', quality=100, subsampling=0)\n   ```\n\n3. **Antialiasing and Image Mode**: Ensure your image is in the correct mode before saving. Convert the image to RGB mode if it isn't already, to ensure all color information is preserved:\n\n   ```python\n   if im.mode != 'RGB':\n       im = im.convert('RGB')\n   im.save('/path/to/cover_2.jpg', format='JPEG', quality=100, subsampling=0)\n   ```\n\n4. **Use a Different Library**: If the quality is still not satisfactory, consider using a different library for saving JPEGs, such as OpenCV or imageio, which might handle JPEG compression differently.\n\n5. **Try Different Formats**: If the image format is not a strict requirement, consider saving the image in a lossless format such as PNG, which will avoid compression artifacts altogether.\n\nBy addressing these potential issues, you should be able to improve the quality of your JPEG images when using the PIL library."
