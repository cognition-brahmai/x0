The traceback is as follows:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"libwfm_test.py\", line 12, in &lt;module&gt;\n    libgidcwf    = ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary(libidcwf_path)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.5/ctypes/__init__.py\", line 431, in LoadLibrary\n    return self._dlltype(name)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.5/ctypes/__init__.py\", line 348, in __init__\n    self._handle = _dlopen(self._name, mode)\nOSError: path-to-my-lib/libwav.so: undefined symbol: ODBCGeneralQuery\n```\n\nIt seems like the LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not having any effect. How can I make these dependency libraries loadable?"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering indicates that the shared library `libwav.so` is trying to use a symbol `ODBCGeneralQuery` that it cannot find. This usually implies that the library has an unresolved dependency on another shared library that provides this symbol.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify LD_LIBRARY_PATH**: Make sure that your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable is set correctly and includes all directories containing the dependent libraries. You can print the variable in your Python script to ensure it's being set properly:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   print(os.environ.get('LD_LIBRARY_PATH'))\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Dependencies with ldd**: Use the `ldd` command to check the dependencies of `libwav.so`. This will show you which libraries are missing or not found:\n\n   ```bash\n   ldd path-to-my-lib/libwav.so\n   ```\n\n   Look for any entries with \"not found\" and ensure those libraries are installed and accessible in one of the directories listed in your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.\n\n3. **Ensure Correct Version of Dependencies**: Sometimes the correct library is found, but it's not the right version. Double-check that the version of the library providing `ODBCGeneralQuery` is compatible with `libwav.so`.\n\n4. **Use `LD_PRELOAD`**: If you know exactly which library contains the `ODBCGeneralQuery` symbol, you can use the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable to force it to load before others:\n\n   ```bash\n   LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/dependency.so python your_script.py\n   ```\n\n5. **Run with strace**: To get more insights into what's happening when your script tries to load the library, you can use `strace` to trace the system calls and signals:\n\n   ```bash\n   strace -f -e open python your_script.py\n   ```\n\n   This might give you more information about which libraries are being attempted to load and where it might be failing.\n\n6. **Recompile with Explicit Linkage**: If you have control over the source of `libwav.so`, ensure that it's being compiled with all necessary dependencies explicitly linked. You can add the library providing `ODBCGeneralQuery` to the linker flags when building your shared library.\n\n7. **Use RPATH or RUNPATH**: If modifying the environment is not ideal, consider embedding the library paths directly into the shared library using `RPATH` or `RUNPATH` at link time. This can be done using the `-Wl,-rpath,/path/to/libs` linker flag.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the undefined symbol error and successfully load your C shared library using `ctypes` in Python."
