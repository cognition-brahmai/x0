The screen remains somewhat readable, but when the graphics change, such as when dragging a window, there are lots of semi-random coloured pixels and small blocks appearing. I've tried resetting the GPU and driver by changing the desktop resolution, but it hasn't resolved the problem. The only solution that seems to work is rebooting the computer. I've encountered this issue on 1.0, 1.1, and possibly 1.3 cards, but currently I am using 1.1 and 2.0 cards. Is there a program or trick that I can use to reset the driver and GPU without having to reboot the system?"

        "content": "Experiencing graphics issues due to CUDA programs can indeed be frustrating. Here are some strategies and tools you can use to reset the GPU and driver without rebooting your system:\n\n1. **NVIDIA-SMI Tool**: \n   - The NVIDIA System Management Interface (nvidia-smi) is a command-line utility that provides monitoring and management capabilities for NVIDIA GPUs. You can use it to reset the GPU.\n   - Open Command Prompt as Administrator and use the command: `nvidia-smi --reset-gpu`. This may help in resetting certain states of the GPU.\n\n2. **TDR (Timeout Detection and Recovery)**:\n   - Windows has a feature called Timeout Detection and Recovery (TDR) that can recover the system from situations where the GPU stops responding. You can adjust TDR settings in the registry to potentially reset the GPU without a full reboot.\n   - To change TDR settings, open the Registry Editor and navigate to:\n     `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\GraphicsDrivers`\n   - Add or modify the `TdrDelay` (DWORD) value to increase the delay before the system resets the GPU. However, be cautious with this as improper changes can lead to system instability.\n\n3. **Kill and Restart Explorer.exe**:\n   - Sometimes restarting the Windows Explorer process can help reset the display without rebooting.\n   - Open Task Manager, find the \"Windows Explorer\" process, and select \"Restart\". This can refresh the desktop and might resolve minor graphical glitches.\n\n4. **Driver Reinstallation**:\n   - Ensure your graphics drivers are up-to-date, as outdated drivers can cause issues. You can also try reinstalling the drivers.\n   - Use a tool like Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU) to completely remove your current drivers, then reinstall the latest version from NVIDIA's website.\n\n5. **Power Cycling the GPU**:\n   - If you're using a desktop system, turning off the power supply and waiting a few minutes before turning it back on can sometimes reset the GPU hardware state.\n\n6. **Monitoring Tools**:\n   - Use GPU monitoring tools like MSI Afterburner or GPU-Z to observe GPU usage and temperature. These tools can sometimes help identify if the GPU is being stressed or overheating.\n\nIf these solutions do not resolve the issue, it might be worth checking if the problem persists with other CUDA programs or if it's specific to one application. Additionally, consider reaching out to NVIDIA support or forums for further assistance, especially if it seems to be a hardware compatibility or driver bug issue."
