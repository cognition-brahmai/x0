Here's a simple way to do it:\n\n```bash\ndirectory_to_check=\"/path/to/directory\"\nfile_to_check=\"my_list.txt\"\n\nif grep -Fxq \"$directory_to_check\" \"$file_to_check\"; then\n    echo \"Directory already exists in the file.\"\nelse\n    echo \"Directory does not exist in the file.\"\n    # Optionally, add the directory to the file\n    echo \"$directory_to_check\" >> \"$file_to_check\"\nfi\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the command:\n\n- `grep`: This command is used to search for patterns in files.\n- `-F`: This option tells `grep` to interpret the pattern as a fixed string, not a regular expression.\n- `-x`: This option makes `grep` match the whole line exactly.\n- `-q`: This option makes `grep` operate in quiet mode, where it doesn't output anything; it only returns an exit status.\n\nIf the directory already exists in the file, `grep` will return an exit status of `0`, and the script will print \"Directory already exists in the file.\" If not, it will print \"Directory does not exist in the file.\" and optionally add the directory to the file."
