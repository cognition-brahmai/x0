I am looking for something similar to Django's transaction request wrapping."

        "content": "To achieve automatic rollback of all changes to the database if an exception is raised in a Flask application using Flask-SQLAlchemy, you can leverage Flask's request lifecycle hooks and SQLAlchemy's session management. The key is to ensure that any uncommitted changes are rolled back when an exception occurs, and that committed changes can also be rolled back if they occur within subtransactions.\n\nHere's a structured approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Use Flask's `teardown_request` and `before_request` Decorators**:\n   - Utilize the `before_request` to initialize a transaction and `teardown_request` to handle the rollback or commit of the transaction based on the success or failure of the request.\n\n2. **Manage Sessions Properly**:\n   - Make sure to handle SQLAlchemy sessions correctly, especially if you are dealing with subtransactions.\n\nHere is an example implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request\nfrom flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'your-database-uri'\ndb = SQLAlchemy(app)\n\n@app.before_request\ndef start_transaction():\n    \"\"\" Start a new transaction before handling a request. \"\"\"\n    db.session.begin_nested()\n\n@app.teardown_request\ndef teardown_request(exception=None):\n    \"\"\" Rollback the transaction if an exception occurred, otherwise commit. \"\"\"\n    if exception is not None:\n        # Rollback any changes if an exception was raised\n        db.session.rollback()\n    else:\n        try:\n            # Attempt to commit the transaction if no exceptions occurred\n            db.session.commit()\n        except Exception as e:\n            # If commit fails, rollback the session\n            db.session.rollback()\n            raise e\n    finally:\n        # Remove the session to ensure no connections are left open\n        db.session.remove()\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef index():\n    # Example view function\n    # Any changes made here will be rolled back if an exception occurs\n    return \"Hello, World!\"\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run()\n```\n\n### Key Concepts:\n- **Nested Transactions**: By using `db.session.begin_nested()`, you're starting a subtransaction. This allows you to rollback changes even if a commit was called within subtransactions.\n- **Session Management**: The `db.session.remove()` call ensures that the session is properly cleaned up after each request, preventing any leftover connections that could lead to database connection issues.\n- **Exception Handling**: The `teardown_request` function checks for exceptions and performs a rollback if necessary. This ensures that any changes made during the request are not persisted if an error occurs.\n\nThis setup mimics Django's transaction handling by ensuring that each request is treated as a transaction unit, rolling back uncommitted changes if an exception is raised. This approach also supports more complex transaction scenarios with the use of nested transactions."
