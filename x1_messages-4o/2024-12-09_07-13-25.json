The Pylint documentation states \"Used when a class has too few public methods, so be sure it's really worth it.\" but it's not clear to me. Could you explain what this error is trying to convey?"

        "content": "The message \"Too few public methods (0/2)\" from Pylint is a warning that is generated when a class in your code has fewer public methods than expected. Pylint has a default expectation that a class should have at least two public methods. When your class has fewer than this number, Pylint flags it to suggest that the class might not be fully developed or is perhaps unnecessary.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what this message means:\n\n1. **Public Methods**: These are methods that are intended to be used by other parts of your program or by external code. They do not start with an underscore (`_`), which is typically used to denote private or internal methods.\n\n2. **Design Consideration**: The warning is meant to prompt you to reconsider the design of your class. A class with very few public methods may indicate that it is not fulfilling its intended role or that it could be simplified or refactored into a different structure, such as a function or a module-level variable.\n\n3. **Intentional Design**: There are cases where having a class with few public methods is intentional and justified. For instance, a class might serve as a simple data container (a \"data class\") or might be part of a larger framework where its methods are called indirectly.\n\n4. **Customizing Pylint**: If you believe that having fewer public methods is justified for your specific case, you can suppress this warning for your class by adding a Pylint directive, or you can adjust the Pylint configuration to change the threshold for this warning.\n\nIn summary, this Pylint message is a suggestion to review your class design to ensure that it serves a meaningful purpose in your code. If you're confident in your design, you can choose to ignore or suppress the message."
