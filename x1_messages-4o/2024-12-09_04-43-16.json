I have an input string 'images/:id/size' and I want to transform it into 'images/<span>:id</span>/size'. I've tried to replicate the Javascript code in Python using the `re.sub` function but it's not giving me the expected result. Instead of replacing `:id` with `<span>:id</span>`, it's replacing it with `<span>$1</span>`. Is `re.sub` the correct function to use for this task in Python and if so, how can I get it to return the correct result?\n\n```python\n>>> method = 'images/:id/huge'\n>>> re.sub('\\:([a-z]+)', '<span>$1</span>', method)\n'images/<span>$1</span>/huge'\n```"

        "content": "In Python, the `re.sub` function works slightly differently from JavaScript's `replace` function. In Python, you cannot use `$1`, `$2`, etc., to refer to captured groups in the replacement string. Instead, you use `\\1`, `\\2`, etc., to refer to captured groups. Here's how you can achieve your desired transformation:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nmethod = 'images/:id/huge'\nresult = re.sub(r':([a-z]+)', r'<span>:\\1</span>', method)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nHere's what this code does:\n- The regular expression `r':([a-z]+)'` captures any sequence of lowercase alphabetic characters that follow a colon `:`. The parentheses `()` around `[a-z]+` create a capture group.\n- In the replacement string `r'<span>:\\1</span>'`, `\\1` refers to the first capture group, which in this case is the sequence of characters matched by `[a-z]+`.\n\nRunning this code will give you the desired output:\n\n```\nimages/<span>:id</span>/huge\n```\n\nThis should correctly replace `:id` with `<span>:id</span>`."
