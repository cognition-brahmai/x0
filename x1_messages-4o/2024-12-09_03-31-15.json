However, I'm encountering an issue and I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Here's my code:\n```python\ncursor.execute (\"UPDATE tblTableName SET Year=%s\" % Year \", Month=%s\" % Month \", Day=%s\" % Day \", Hour=%s\" % Hour \", Minute=%s\" Minute \"WHERE Server=%s \" % ServerID)\n```\nCan anyone identify the mistake in the query?"

        "content": "Certainly! The issue with your Python MySQL update statement is in the way you are formatting the SQL string and using string interpolation. You are trying to directly insert variables into the SQL query using the `%` operator and concatenation, which can lead to syntax errors and is also unsafe due to SQL injection risks.\n\nA better and safer way to construct the query is to use parameterized queries. This approach uses placeholders for the values and provides them as a tuple in the `execute` method. Here's how you can fix your code:\n\n```python\nquery = \"\"\"\n    UPDATE tblTableName \n    SET Year = %s, Month = %s, Day = %s, Hour = %s, Minute = %s\n    WHERE Server = %s\n\"\"\"\n\nvalues = (Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute, ServerID)\n\ncursor.execute(query, values)\n```\n\nIn this version:\n- The SQL query uses `%s` as placeholders for the values.\n- The `values` tuple contains the variables in the order they appear in the query.\n- The `execute` method takes the query and the `values` tuple, ensuring the variables are safely inserted into the query.\n\nThis not only makes your code cleaner and easier to read but also helps prevent SQL injection attacks by properly escaping the input values."
