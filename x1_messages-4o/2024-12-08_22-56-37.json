        "content": "Change blindness is a psychological phenomenon where people fail to notice changes in a visual scene. Here are three example cases illustrating how change blindness can occur:\n\n1. **The Flicker Paradigm**: In a controlled experimental setting, two images of a scene are presented to a viewer with a brief blank screen or \"flicker\" in between them. The two images are identical except for one change, like a missing object or a change in color. Despite the alteration, viewers often fail to notice the difference due to the interruption caused by the flicker, which disrupts the visual continuity and makes it difficult to detect changes.\n\n2. **Real-Life Interaction**: Imagine a scenario where a person is giving directions to someone on the street. During the conversation, a group of people carrying a large object, like a door, walk between them, temporarily blocking the view. During this brief interruption, the person asking for directions is replaced with another person. Many people fail to notice the switch due to their focus on the task (giving directions) and the disruption caused by the passing object.\n\n3. **Continuous Motion**: In a movie or video game, subtle changes can occur in the background or even in the main characters that viewers might not notice because their attention is directed elsewhere. For instance, a character's clothing might change color, or an object in the background might disappear or move slightly. These changes often go unnoticed because the viewer's attention is focused on the narrative or action, and the continuity of motion makes it harder to detect slow changes.\n\nThese examples show how a disruption in visual attention or focus can lead to change blindness, even when changes occur right in front of us."
