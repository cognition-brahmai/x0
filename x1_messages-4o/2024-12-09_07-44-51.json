        "content": "To construct a 3D tensor where each 2D sub-tensor is a diagonal matrix formed from a 2D input tensor, you can use the `torch.diag_embed()` function in PyTorch. This function is specifically designed to handle the creation of diagonal matrices from a batch of vectors, effectively addressing your requirement.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how you can achieve this:\n\n1. Assume you have a 2D tensor `diag_ele` of shape `(index_in_batch, num_elements)`, where each row represents the diagonal elements for a matrix.\n\n2. Use `torch.diag_embed()` to transform this 2D tensor into a 3D tensor, where each 2D slice is a diagonal matrix.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\n# Sample input tensor\ndiag_ele = torch.tensor([\n    [1.0, 2.0, 3.0],\n    [4.0, 5.0, 6.0],\n])\n\n# Use torch.diag_embed to create a 3D tensor where each 2D slice is a diagonal matrix\ndiag_matrices = torch.diag_embed(diag_ele)\n\nprint(diag_matrices)\n```\n\nIn this example, `diag_ele` is a 2D tensor with shape `(2, 3)`. The resulting `diag_matrices` will be a 3D tensor with shape `(2, 3, 3)`, where each slice along the first dimension is a diagonal matrix constructed from the corresponding row of `diag_ele`.\n\nThis approach makes it easy to create a batch of diagonal matrices from a given 2D tensor in PyTorch."
