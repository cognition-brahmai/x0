For non-linear regression, you might want to consider polynomial regression or using neural networks for more complex patterns. Here, I'll provide an example using polynomial regression.\n\n### Using Polynomial Regression\n\nPolynomial regression is an extension of linear regression, where the relationship between the independent variable \\( x \\) and the dependent variable \\( y \\) is modeled as an \\( n \\)-th degree polynomial.\n\nHere's a simple example using JavaScript:\n\n#### Step 1: Prepare Your Data\n\nFirst, you need to have your data ready. Let's assume you have some data points:\n\n```javascript\nconst data = [\n  { x: 1, y: 2 },\n  { x: 2, y: 3 },\n  { x: 3, y: 5 },\n  { x: 4, y: 4 },\n  { x: 5, y: 6 }\n];\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Choose a Library\n\nFor this example, we can use a lightweight library like `regression-js` which supports polynomial regression.\n\nFirst, include the library in your project. If you're working in a Node.js environment, you can install it using npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install regression\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Implement Polynomial Regression\n\nHere's a sample code to perform polynomial regression:\n\n```javascript\nconst regression = require('regression');\n\n// Convert your data into the format required by the library\nconst formattedData = data.map(point => [point.x, point.y]);\n\n// Perform polynomial regression with a degree of 2 (quadratic)\nconst result = regression.polynomial(formattedData, { order: 2 });\n\nconsole.log(result);\n```\n\nThis will give you an object with the equation of the polynomial, the coefficients, and the R-squared value, which is a measure of how well the regression line fits the data.\n\n#### Step 4: Interpret the Result\n\nThe result from the above code might look something like this:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  equation: [0.5, 1.2, 0.8],\n  points: [ [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 5], [4, 4], [5, 6] ],\n  string: 'y = 0.8x^2 + 1.2x + 0.5',\n  r2: 0.95\n}\n```\n\n- **Equation**: The coefficients of the polynomial equation. In this case, \\( y = 0.8x^2 + 1.2x + 0.5 \\).\n- **Points**: The fitted points on the curve.\n- **R-squared (r2)**: This value indicates how well the model fits the data. An R-squared value close to 1 indicates a good fit.\n\n### Advanced Non-linear Regression\n\nFor more complex non-linear regression, consider using TensorFlow.js to build a neural network model. Here's a very basic example of using TensorFlow.js for non-linear regression:\n\n```javascript\nconst tf = require('@tensorflow/tfjs-node');\n\n// Prepare your data\nconst xs = tf.tensor1d([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);\nconst ys = tf.tensor1d([2, 3, 5, 4, 6]);\n\n// Define a simple sequential model\nconst model = tf.sequential();\nmodel.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 10, activation: 'sigmoid', inputShape: [1] }));\nmodel.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 1 }));\n\n// Compile the model\nmodel.compile({ optimizer: 'sgd', loss: 'meanSquaredError' });\n\n// Train the model\nmodel.fit(xs, ys, {\n  epochs: 1000\n}).then(() => {\n  // Make predictions\n  model.predict(tf.tensor1d([6])).print();\n});\n```\n\nThis example uses a simple neural network with one hidden layer to model the relationship between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Adjust the number of units and layers according to the complexity of your data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIncorporating non-linear variables into a regression model in JavaScript is straightforward with the right libraries. Choose the method that best fits the complexity of your data, whether it's polynomial regression for simpler non-linear patterns or neural networks for more complex scenarios."
