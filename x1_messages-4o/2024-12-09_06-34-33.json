It seems like you are encountering an issue with `ensurepip`, which is often due to the absence of some necessary packages. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you resolve this:\n\n1. **Update and Upgrade Your System:**\n\n   First, make sure your system is up-to-date by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt update\n   sudo apt upgrade\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Required Dependencies:**\n\n   Before installing Python, you need to install some dependencies:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt install software-properties-common\n   ```\n\n3. **Add Deadsnakes PPA:**\n\n   The Deadsnakes PPA contains newer Python versions that are not available in the default Ubuntu repositories. Add it using:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa\n   sudo apt update\n   ```\n\n4. **Install Python 3.7:**\n\n   Now, install Python 3.7:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt install python3.7\n   ```\n\n5. **Install Python 3.7 Virtual Environment and Pip:**\n\n   You need to install `python3.7-venv` and `python3.7-distutils` to create a virtual environment and manage packages:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt install python3.7-venv python3.7-distutils\n   ```\n\n6. **Create a Virtual Environment:**\n\n   Once the packages are installed, you can create a virtual environment using Python 3.7. Navigate to your project directory and run:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.7 -m venv myenv\n   ```\n\n   Replace `myenv` with the name you want for your virtual environment.\n\n7. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**\n\n   To start using the virtual environment, activate it with the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n   After activation, your shell prompt should change to indicate that you are now working inside the virtual environment.\n\n8. **Upgrade pip:**\n\n   It\u2019s a good practice to upgrade pip in your virtual environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade pip\n   ```\n\n9. **Install Packages:**\n\n   Now you can install any Python package using pip. For example:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install numpy\n   ```\n\n10. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment:**\n\n    Once you're done working in the virtual environment, you can deactivate it by simply running:\n\n    ```bash\n    deactivate\n    ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully create a Python 3.7 virtual environment and manage packages using pip on Ubuntu 18.04."
