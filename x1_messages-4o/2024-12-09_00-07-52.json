        "content": "Certainly! In MATLAB, you can perform a Fourier transform on a signal using the `fft` function, which computes the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Here's a basic example of how to perform an FFT on a signal and plot its frequency spectrum. I'll also show you how this can be applied to analyze the frequency content of an audio signal.\n\n### Example Code to Perform and Plot FFT\n\n```matlab\n% Sample Rate and Time Vector\nFs = 1000;            % Sampling frequency in Hz\nT = 1/Fs;             % Sampling period in seconds\nL = 1000;             % Length of signal\nt = (0:L-1)*T;        % Time vector\n\n% Create a sample signal: a sum of two sine waves\nf1 = 50;              % Frequency of first sine wave\nf2 = 120;             % Frequency of second sine wave\nsignal = 0.7*sin(2*pi*f1*t) + sin(2*pi*f2*t);\n\n% Add some noise to the signal\nnoisySignal = signal + 2*randn(size(t));\n\n% Perform Fourier Transform\nY = fft(noisySignal);\n\n% Compute the two-sided spectrum P2\nP2 = abs(Y/L);\n\n% Compute the single-sided spectrum P1 based on P2 and the even-valued signal length L\nP1 = P2(1:L/2+1);\nP1(2:end-1) = 2*P1(2:end-1);\n\n% Define the frequency domain f\nf = Fs*(0:(L/2))/L;\n\n% Plot the single-sided amplitude spectrum\nfigure;\nplot(f, P1)\ntitle('Single-Sided Amplitude Spectrum of X(t)')\nxlabel('Frequency (f) in Hz')\nylabel('|P1(f)|')\n\n% Optional: Listen to the original and noisy signal\n% sound(signal, Fs);\n% sound(noisySignal, Fs);\n```\n\n### Analyzing an Audio Signal\n\nTo analyze an audio signal, you can use the `audioread` function to load the audio file, then apply the FFT similarly. Here is an example:\n\n```matlab\n% Read an audio file\n[audioSignal, Fs] = audioread('example.wav');\n\n% Use only one channel if it's a stereo file\naudioSignal = audioSignal(:, 1);\n\n% Length of the audio signal\nL = length(audioSignal);\n\n% Perform Fourier Transform\nY = fft(audioSignal);\n\n% Compute the two-sided and single-sided spectrum\nP2 = abs(Y/L);\nP1 = P2(1:L/2+1);\nP1(2:end-1) = 2*P1(2:end-1);\n\n% Define the frequency domain f\nf = Fs*(0:(L/2))/L;\n\n% Plot the single-sided amplitude spectrum\nfigure;\nplot(f, P1)\ntitle('Single-Sided Amplitude Spectrum of Audio Signal')\nxlabel('Frequency (f) in Hz')\nylabel('|P1(f)|')\n\n% Optional: Listen to the original audio signal\n% sound(audioSignal, Fs);\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Fs**: This is the sampling frequency, which determines how many samples per second are collected.\n- **fft**: This function computes the FFT of the signal, transforming it from the time domain to the frequency domain.\n- **P2 and P1**: These are used to calculate the two-sided and single-sided amplitude spectra, respectively.\n- **f**: The frequency domain for plotting.\n\nThis example creates a signal composed of two sine waves, adds noise, and then computes and plots the FFT to show the frequency components. Similarly, for an audio file, you load it, perform the FFT, and plot to analyze its frequency content. Adjust the file name 'example.wav' to the audio file you wish to analyze."
