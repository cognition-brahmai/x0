        "content": "To create a loop in Python that counts backwards from 100 to 0, you need to specify a negative step in the `range` function. The `range` function syntax is `range(start, stop, step)`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(100, -1, -1):\n    print(i)\n```\n\nIn this corrected version:\n\n- `100` is the starting point.\n- `-1` is the stopping point (the loop will stop before reaching this value, so it will include `0`).\n- `-1` is the step, indicating that the loop should count downwards by 1 each time."
