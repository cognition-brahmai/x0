From the documentation, it seems that double back-quotes are used for literals, while single back-quotes are used when there is code text to be interpreted. I am trying to write the docstring for a method `f()` in a class as shown below:\n\n```python\nclass A(B):\n    def f(arg1, arg2):\n        return B(arg1 + arg2 + self.index)\n```\n\nThe docstring I am considering is:\n\n```python\nTakes two arguments, ``arg1` and ``arg2``, which are assumed to be objects\nof type (or duck-type) `NiceClass`, and returns a new object of class `B`\nwith `B.something` assigned some hash of ``arg1`` and ``arg2``.\n```\n\nIs this the correct usage? I've also noticed many code examples, including Sphinx, where `B` and `NiceClass` are wrapped in double back-quotes (\"``B``\" and \"``NiceClass``\"). Could you please clarify the correct usage?"

        "content": "In reStructuredText (reST), which is used by Sphinx for documentation, the conventions for back-ticks are as follows:\n\n1. **Single Back-Ticks (`...`)**: These are typically used for inline literals or for referencing roles (like `:class:`, `:meth:`, etc.) in reST. When you use single back-ticks without any role, it usually implies a cross-reference. Sphinx will try to resolve it as a reference to a class, method, attribute, etc., if it matches any documented symbol.\n\n2. **Double Back-Ticks (``...``)**: Double back-ticks are used to represent inline code literals. This means the text inside them is treated as code, but without any specific semantic meaning like the cross-referencing single back-ticks provide. It's essentially for formatting to indicate something is code-like.\n\nIn your docstring example:\n\n```plaintext\nTakes two arguments, ``arg1`` and ``arg2``, which are assumed to be objects\nof type (or duck-type) `NiceClass`, and returns a new object of class `B`\nwith `B.something` assigned some hash of ``arg1`` and ``arg2``.\n```\n\nHere's how you might want to format it:\n\n- Use double back-ticks for `arg1` and `arg2` because they are parameters to the function `f()` and are being used as code literals:\n\n  - `Takes two arguments, ``arg1`` and ``arg2``, ...`\n\n- Use single back-ticks with the appropriate role for `NiceClass` and `B` if they are references to classes within your documentation. If you have defined `NiceClass` and `B` elsewhere in your code and are documenting them with Sphinx, you can use the `:class:` role:\n\n  - `...which are assumed to be objects of type (or duck-type) :class:`NiceClass`, and returns a new object of class :class:`B` ...`\n\n- For `B.something`, if it is an attribute of the class `B`, you might want to use:\n\n  - `...with :attr:`B.something` assigned some hash of...`\n\nTo summarize, use single back-ticks with roles for references and cross-linking (like `:class:` and `:attr:`), and use double back-ticks for inline code literals that do not require cross-referencing. Adjust these as per your documentation needs and ensure the symbols you reference are properly documented for Sphinx to resolve."
