Specifically, I want to change the color or highlight a cell if its value is greater than the value of the first cell in its row. Here is the code I've written so far:\n\n```python\nfor index in range(0, df.shape[0]):\n    for column in range(1, df.shape[1]): # from 1 not from 0 because I only need # to compare the 2nd to the last cell of each row with the 1st cell in the row \n\n        if df.iloc[index][column] - df_BDE_n_months_avg_std_pct.iloc[index][0] > 0:\n            # I need a piece of code here that can highlight the cell\n        else:\n            # Do nothing\n```\nHowever, I haven't been able to find a way to achieve the desired cell highlighting. Can anyone help me with this?"

        "content": "To achieve cell highlighting in a pandas DataFrame based on certain conditions, you can use the `style.apply` method in combination with a custom function that applies styles to the DataFrame. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'A': [5, 3, 6],\n    'B': [7, 4, 2],\n    'C': [1, 8, 5]\n}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Function to apply conditional formatting\ndef highlight_cells(x):\n    # Copy dataframe to not modify the original\n    df_styled = x.copy()\n\n    # Iterate over all rows\n    for index in range(0, df_styled.shape[0]):\n        first_cell_value = df_styled.iloc[index, 0]  # Value of the first cell in the row\n\n        for column in range(1, df_styled.shape[1]):\n            # Compare with the first cell\n            if df_styled.iloc[index, column] > first_cell_value:\n                # Apply style\n                df_styled.iloc[index, column] = 'background-color: yellow'\n            else:\n                # No style\n                df_styled.iloc[index, column] = ''\n\n    return df_styled\n\n# Apply the function\nstyled_df = df.style.apply(highlight_cells, axis=None)\n\n# To display the styled DataFrame in a Jupyter Notebook environment\nstyled_df\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `highlight_cells` is a function that checks each cell in the DataFrame and compares it with the first cell in its row.\n- If a cell's value is greater than the first cell's value, its background color is set to yellow.\n- The `style.apply` method is used to apply the `highlight_cells` function across the DataFrame.\n\nThis solution should work in Jupyter Notebook or any environment that supports rendering pandas Styler objects. If you're working outside of such environments, you might need to look into exporting the styled DataFrame to Excel or another format that supports styling."
