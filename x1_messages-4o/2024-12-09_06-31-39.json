        "content": "To use the Anaconda version of Python instead of the default Apple version, you need to make sure that the path to Anaconda's Python is correctly set at the beginning of your `PATH` environment variable. It seems like your `.bash_profile` is modifying the `PATH` in a way that might override the Anaconda path. Here's how you can fix it:\n\n1. **Edit your `.bash_profile`:** You should ensure that the Anaconda path is at the very beginning of your `PATH`. Modify your `.bash_profile` as follows:\n\n    ```bash\n    # Ensure Anaconda is at the start of the PATH\n    export PATH=\"$HOME/anaconda/bin:$PATH\"\n\n    # Other paths\n    MONGO_PATH=/usr/local/mongodb/bin\n    SQL_PATH=/usr/local/mysql\n\n    # Add Mongo and SQL paths\n    export PATH=\"$MONGO_PATH:$SQL_PATH:$PATH\"\n    ```\n\n2. **Save and reload your `.bash_profile`:** After making these changes, save the file and run the following command to reload it:\n\n    ```bash\n    source ~/.bash_profile\n    ```\n\n3. **Verify the Python version:** After reloading your `.bash_profile`, check the Python version to ensure it's using Anaconda's version:\n\n    ```bash\n    python --version\n    ```\n\n    You should see the Anaconda Python version displayed.\n\n4. **Use `python3` if necessary:** If you are specifically looking for Python 3, make sure you've installed the Python 3 version of Anaconda. You can also use `python3` to check:\n\n    ```bash\n    python3 --version\n    ```\n\nIf you still encounter issues, ensure that Anaconda is correctly installed and that there are no typos in your `.bash_profile`. Also, consider restarting your terminal session to ensure all changes take effect."
