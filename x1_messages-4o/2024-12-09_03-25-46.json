        "content": "As of my last update, scikit-learn does not have a dedicated subspace clustering package. However, you can use some of scikit-learn's general-purpose clustering algorithms as a starting point and then adapt them for subspace clustering by leveraging dimensionality reduction techniques or by pre-processing your data in specific ways. \n\nFor subspace clustering, you might want to explore other libraries specifically designed for this purpose, such as:\n\n1. **PySubspace**: A Python library that contains implementations of various subspace clustering algorithms. It's specifically tailored for subspace clustering tasks.\n\n2. **SubClu**: An algorithm that identifies clusters in subspaces of high-dimensional data. You might find implementations of this in research papers or specialized libraries.\n\n3. **CLIQUE**: Another algorithm for subspace clustering that can sometimes be found in data mining toolkits or research code repositories.\n\nAlternatively, you can pre-process your data using techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the dimensionality and then apply traditional clustering methods available in scikit-learn, such as KMeans or DBSCAN, to the pre-processed data."
