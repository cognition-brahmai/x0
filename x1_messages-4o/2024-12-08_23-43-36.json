The word \"before\" indicates that the action of going for a walk happened first.\n\nAs for the sentence structure and grammatical correctness, the sentence is indeed correct. It clearly states the sequence of actions in a logical manner. Here's the analysis:\n\n- \"I went for a walk in the park\" is an independent clause.\n- \"before playing hide and seek\" is a prepositional phrase that indicates the timing of the actions.\n\nThe sentence is clear, concise, and grammatically correct."
