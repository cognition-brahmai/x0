Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport locale\n\n# Set locale to a region that uses '.' as the thousands separator\nlocale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, 'de_DE')  # German locale as an example\n\n# Format the number\nnumber = 1000000\nformatted_number = locale.format_string(\"%d\", number, grouping=True)\n\nprint(formatted_number)  # Output: 1.000.000\n```\n\nPlease note that the locale `'de_DE'` is used here as an example because Germany uses `.` as the thousands separator. You may need to adjust the locale setting depending on your specific requirements or the locale available on your system.\n\nIf the specific locale is not available on your system, you might encounter an error. In such a case, you can manually format the number as follows:\n\n```python\nnumber = 1000000\nformatted_number = f\"{number:,}\".replace(',', '.')\nprint(formatted_number)  # Output: 1.000.000\n```\n\nThis approach uses Python's string formatting features to insert commas as thousands separators and then replaces them with periods."
