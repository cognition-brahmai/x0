        "content": "I am often required to remove items from a list or other sequence type in Python, based on certain criteria. However, I haven't found an elegant and efficient solution yet, especially since I can't remove items from a list I'm currently iterating through. For instance, when I try:\n\n```python\nfor name in names:\n    if name[-5:] == 'Smith':\n        names.remove(name)\n```\nThis doesn't work as expected. My current workaround looks like this:\n\n```python\ntoremove = []\nfor name in names:\n    if name[-5:] == 'Smith':\n        toremove.append(name)\nfor name in toremove:\n    names.remove(name)\ndel toremove\n```\nThis seems inefficient, not very elegant and it might not handle multiple entries of the same name correctly. Can anyone suggest a more efficient or elegant solution? Also, how can I apply this solution for dictionaries?"

        "content": "Certainly! The issue you're facing with modifying a list while iterating over it is a common one in Python. When you remove an element from a list while iterating, it changes the indices of the remaining elements, which can lead to unexpected behavior.\n\nA more elegant and efficient solution is to use list comprehensions to create a new list that only includes the elements you want to keep. Here's how you can do it for your list of names:\n\n```python\nnames = [name for name in names if name[-5:] != 'Smith']\n```\n\nThis one-liner will create a new list that includes only the names that do not end with 'Smith', effectively removing the ones that do.\n\nFor dictionaries, if you want to remove items based on certain criteria, you can use a dictionary comprehension. Here's an example:\n\nSuppose you have a dictionary where the key is a name and the value is some data associated with that name. You want to remove entries where the key ends with 'Smith':\n\n```python\ndata = {name: value for name, value in data.items() if not name.endswith('Smith')}\n```\n\nThis code will create a new dictionary excluding the entries where the key ends with 'Smith'.\n\nBoth of these methods are efficient and handle multiple entries correctly, as they create new collections with only the desired elements, leaving the original sequence unchanged during iteration."
