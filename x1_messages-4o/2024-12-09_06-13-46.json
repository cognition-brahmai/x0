        "content": "To instantiate a class from its string name in a dynamically imported module, you need to access the class using `getattr()` instead of directly trying to call `modul.class_name()`. This is because `modul.class_name` is interpreted as trying to access an attribute named `class_name` in the module, which doesn't exist. Instead, you should use `getattr()` to get the class by name and then instantiate it. Here is how you could modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nclass Loader:\n    def __init__(self, module_name, class_name):\n        try:\n            # Dynamically import the module\n            __import__(module_name)\n            modul = sys.modules[module_name]\n            \n            # Use getattr to retrieve the class from the module\n            klass = getattr(modul, class_name)\n            \n            # Instantiate the class\n            instance = klass()\n            \n            # For demonstration purposes, let's print the instance\n            print(f\"Instance of {class_name} created: {instance}\")\n            \n        except ImportError:\n            print(f\"Failed to import module: {module_name}\")\n        except AttributeError:\n            print(f\"Class {class_name} not found in module {module_name}\")\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n# Example usage:\n# Assuming you have a module named 'your_module' with a class 'myName'\n# loader = Loader('your_module', 'myName')\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Dynamic Import**: The `__import__()` function is used to import the module at runtime.\n\n2. **Accessing the Class**: `getattr(modul, class_name)` dynamically retrieves the class from the module using its name.\n\n3. **Instantiation**: Once you have the class object (`klass`), you can instantiate it as you would normally do with any class.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: The code handles a few possible exceptions:\n   - `ImportError` if the module cannot be imported.\n   - `AttributeError` if the class does not exist in the module.\n   - A generic exception handler to catch any other unexpected errors.\n\nThis approach allows you to dynamically load any module and instantiate a class defined within it, as long as you provide the correct module and class names."
