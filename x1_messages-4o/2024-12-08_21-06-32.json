        "content": "The script you provided has a misunderstanding in its logic. The dataset you've defined contains countries, their capitals, and populations, but it does not include other cities like \"New York.\" Therefore, you need to adjust the script to extract the population of a country based on its capital city or modify the dataset to include more cities if that's your intent.\n\nHere's a revised version of the script to correctly access the population of a country based on the capital city:\n\n```python\ncountry_data = {\n    \"USA\": {\n        \"capital\": \"Washington, D.C.\",\n        \"population\": 328.2\n    },\n    \"France\": {\n        \"capital\": \"Paris\",\n        \"population\": 66.99\n    },\n    \"Brazil\": {\n        \"capital\": \"Bras\u00edlia\",\n        \"population\": 208.4\n    },\n    \"India\": {\n        \"capital\": \"New Delhi\",\n        \"population\": 1353\n    }\n}\n\ndef get_population_by_capital(city):\n    for country, data in country_data.items():\n        if data[\"capital\"] == city:\n            return data[\"population\"]\n    return \"City not found\"\n\ncity = \"New Delhi\"\npopulation = get_population_by_capital(city)\nprint(f\"The population of the country with its capital in {city} is: {population}\")\n```\n\nIf you want to include other cities within the countries and their populations, you need to expand the dataset. Here's how you could do it:\n\n```python\ncountry_data = {\n    \"USA\": {\n        \"cities\": {\n            \"Washington, D.C.\": 328.2,\n            \"New York\": 8.399  # Example population in millions\n        }\n    },\n    \"France\": {\n        \"cities\": {\n            \"Paris\": 66.99\n        }\n    },\n    \"Brazil\": {\n        \"cities\": {\n            \"Bras\u00edlia\": 208.4\n        }\n    },\n    \"India\": {\n        \"cities\": {\n            \"New Delhi\": 1353\n        }\n    }\n}\n\ndef get_population_by_city(country, city):\n    if country in country_data:\n        return country_data[country][\"cities\"].get(city, \"City not found\")\n    return \"Country not found\"\n\ncountry = \"USA\"\ncity = \"New York\"\npopulation = get_population_by_city(country, city)\nprint(f\"The population of {city} in {country} is: {population}\")\n```\n\nThis second approach allows you to look up the population of specific cities within each country."
