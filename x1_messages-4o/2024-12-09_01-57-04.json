        "content": "In Python, I am trying to calculate a function of itself multiple times, essentially creating a function iterator. I've defined a function `iterator()` that takes a function, an initial value, and the number of iterations as parameters and returns an array of all intermediate results. I've also defined `funcM(x)` that I pass as an argument to `iterator()`. My current approach works, but I'm wondering if there's a way to achieve the same result without having to define `funcM()`. Particularly, is it possible to pass a lambda function as an argument to the `iterator()` function?\n\nHere is my current code:\n\n```python\ndef iterator(function, x, n=4):\n    x = float(x)\n    arr = []\n    for i in range(n + 1):\n        arr.append(x)\n        x = function(x)\n    return arr\n\ndef funcM(x):\n    return x / 4 + 12\n\nprint(iterator(funcM, 100, 5))\n```"

        "content": "Yes, you can definitely use a lambda function as an argument for the `iterator()` function instead of defining a separate function like `funcM()`. Lambda functions are anonymous functions defined with the `lambda` keyword in Python and can be used for simple operations. Here's how you can modify your code to use a lambda function:\n\n```python\ndef iterator(function, x, n=4):\n    x = float(x)\n    arr = []\n    for i in range(n + 1):\n        arr.append(x)\n        x = function(x)\n    return arr\n\n# Using a lambda function instead of defining funcM\nprint(iterator(lambda x: x / 4 + 12, 100, 5))\n```\n\nIn this code, the lambda function `lambda x: x / 4 + 12` is directly passed as an argument to the `iterator()` function. It performs the same calculation as your original `funcM()` function without the need to define it separately. This approach is particularly useful for simple, one-off functions."
