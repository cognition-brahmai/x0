However, you can call other static methods from within a static method by referring to them through the class name.\n\nHere's how you can call `methodA` within `methodB`:\n\n```python\nclass A:\n    @staticmethod\n    def methodA():\n        print('methodA')\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def methodB():\n        print('methodB')\n        A.methodA()  # Call methodA using the class name\n\n# Example usage\nA.methodB()\n```\n\nWhen `A.methodB()` is called, it will print \"methodB\" and then call `A.methodA()`, which will print \"methodA\"."
