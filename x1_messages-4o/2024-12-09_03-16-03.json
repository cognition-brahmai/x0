The error message that I receive is \"ClientError: Unable to parse csv: rows 1-5000, file /opt/ml/input/data/train/KMeans_data.csv\". I've opted for 'text/csv' as the content type and my CSV file has 5 columns which are filled with numerical content and text headers. Can anyone help me figure out what is causing this issue?"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering suggests that Amazon SageMaker is having trouble parsing your CSV file. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Header Row**: Ensure that your CSV file does not contain a header row if your input format does not support it. SageMaker expects data without headers for some algorithms. If headers are present, try removing them and see if the issue persists.\n\n2. **CSV Formatting**: Double-check the CSV file for any formatting issues, such as extra commas, inconsistent row lengths, or special characters. Any inconsistencies in the format could cause parsing errors.\n\n3. **File Encoding**: Make sure that your file is encoded in UTF-8 format, as other encodings might not be supported.\n\n4. **Numerical Data**: Verify that all numerical data is indeed numerical and that there are no stray characters or text that might be causing the parse error.\n\n5. **Consistent Row Lengths**: Ensure that each row in the CSV has the same number of columns. A mismatch in the number of columns across rows can lead to parsing issues.\n\n6. **Data Types**: Check if there are any non-numeric values in your data where numbers are expected. Sometimes data might be corrupted or misformatted, leading to parsing issues.\n\n7. **File Size and Limits**: If your file is very large, consider validating a smaller subset of the data to ensure that the issue isn't related to file size or limits.\n\n8. **S3 Path and Permissions**: Double-check that the path to your CSV file in S3 is correct and that the SageMaker role has the necessary permissions to access the file.\n\n9. **Use a Data Validation Tool**: Consider using a data validation tool or script to scan your CSV file for anomalies or issues that might not be immediately apparent.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, try creating a smaller, simplified version of your dataset and test whether that works. This can help isolate whether the problem is with the file format or specific data entries. If the issue persists even after these checks, consider reaching out to AWS support for more in-depth assistance."
