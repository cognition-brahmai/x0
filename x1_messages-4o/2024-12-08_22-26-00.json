        "content": "A sun dog, also known as a parhelion, is an atmospheric optical phenomenon that consists of bright spots appearing on either side of the Sun. These bright spots are typically seen when the Sun is low on the horizon, such as during sunrise or sunset, and they are caused by the refraction of sunlight through ice crystals in the atmosphere. The ice crystals, usually in the form of hexagonal plates, bend the light at specific angles, creating rainbow-like halos around the Sun. Sun dogs are often seen in pairs, positioned at the same elevation as the Sun, and can appear as colorful patches of light resembling a secondary Sun. They are a beautiful and fascinating natural occurrence, often mistaken for rainbows or halos."
