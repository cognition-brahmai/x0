        "content": "In Python, static methods do not have a direct reference to the class object when they are called. This means that inside a static method, you cannot directly determine the class that was used to make the method call. However, you can work around this limitation by using some additional techniques.\n\nHere\u2019s one way to determine the class name from which a static method is called:\n\n1. Use a class method instead of a static method, which gives you access to the class object.\n2. If you must use a static method, you can pass the class as an argument when calling the method.\n\nHere is an example using a class method:\n\n```python\nclass Bar(object):\n\n    @classmethod\n    def bar(cls):\n        print(f\"Called from class: {cls.__name__}\")\n\nclass Foo(Bar):\n    pass\n\n# Usage\nFoo.bar()  # Output: Called from class: Foo\n```\n\nIn this example, the `bar` method is a class method, which receives the class (`cls`) as its first argument. This allows you to determine the class from which the method was called.\n\nIf you want to stick with a static method for some reason, you can pass the class as an argument manually:\n\n```python\nclass Bar(object):\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def bar(caller_class):\n        print(f\"Called from class: {caller_class.__name__}\")\n\nclass Foo(Bar):\n    pass\n\n# Usage\nFoo.bar(Foo)  # Output: Called from class: Foo\n```\n\nIn this example, you explicitly pass the class `Foo` as an argument when calling the `bar` method, allowing you to determine the calling class."
