The map provided to Mary is incomplete but shows the location of the traps, and each trap has a specific weight trigger. To successfully obtain the artifact, Mary needs to make strategic moves and carefully calculate her steps to avoid triggering the traps. Moreover, she needs to outsmart her rival treasure hunter who is hot on her heels. Can you create a plan in Markdown format that will help Mary navigate through the cave and achieve her goal? Your plan must require logical reasoning and use a combination of mathematical and verbal skills to solve the puzzle. Good luck!"

This plan incorporates logical reasoning and mathematical calculations to ensure success.\n\n```markdown\n# Mary's Cave Navigation Plan\n\n## Objective\nHelp Mary retrieve the valuable artifact from the ancient cave while avoiding traps and outsmarting her rival treasure hunter.\n\n## Cave Map Overview\n- **Incomplete Map:** Shows known trap locations with weight triggers.\n- **Traps:** Each trap triggers if a specific weight limit is exceeded.\n- **Artifact Location:** Known but requires precise navigation to reach.\n\n## Strategy\n\n### Step 1: Assess Known Trap Locations\n- **Identify Trap Types:** \n  1. Pressure Plate Traps: Triggered by weight.\n  2. Swinging Blade Traps: Activated by movement.\n- **Review Weight Limits:** For pressure plate traps, ensure Mary\u2019s steps remain under the weight limit.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Optimal Path\n- **Use Known Safe Zones:** Mark safe zones on the map.\n- **Shortest Path Algorithm:** Apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest safe path to the artifact.\n  \n### Step 3: Avoiding Traps\n- **Pressure Plate Calculation:**\n  - **Weight Management:** Carry minimal equipment to stay under weight limits.\n  - **Step Calculation:** Use small, deliberate steps in pressure plate areas.\n\n- **Swinging Blade Avoidance:**\n  - **Timing:** Observe blade patterns and time movements accordingly.\n  - **Quick Movements:** Use quick, calculated dashes during safe intervals.\n\n### Step 4: Outsmart the Rival\n- **Misdirection:**\n  - **Create Diversions:** Use sound or light to mislead the rival into trap zones.\n  - **Decoy Path:** Leave false clues leading away from the artifact.\n\n- **Speed and Stealth:**\n  - **Maintain Speed:** Balance speed with caution to stay ahead.\n  - **Stealth Approach:** Use the cave's natural sounds to mask movements.\n\n### Step 5: Retrieve the Artifact\n- **Final Approach:**\n  - **Silent Steps:** On final approach, minimize noise.\n  - **Secure the Artifact:** Once at the location, quickly secure the artifact.\n\n### Step 6: Escape Plan\n- **Reverse Route:** Use the same path to exit, mindful of any changes.\n- **Cover Tracks:** Ensure no trace is left for the rival to follow.\n\n## Contingency Plan\n- **Trapped by Rival:** Use hidden side passages (marked on the map) to escape.\n- **Unexpected Traps:** Always have a backup tool (e.g., pole) to test unknown areas.\n\n## Conclusion\nBy following this strategic plan, Mary can efficiently navigate the cave, avoid traps, outsmart her rival, and secure the valuable artifact. Logical reasoning, along with precise calculations and timing, will ensure success.\n```\n\nThis plan combines logical reasoning, mathematical calculations, and strategic thinking to guide Mary safely to her goal while avoiding traps and outsmarting her rival. Good luck, Mary!"
