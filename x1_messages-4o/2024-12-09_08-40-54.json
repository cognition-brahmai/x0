        "content": "I am developing a Python module that is divided into two sections: a set of functions defining a public interface and an implementation class used by these functions which is not significant outside of the module. Initially, I tried to \"hide\" this implementation class by defining it inside the function using it, but it impacted readability and wasn't feasible when multiple functions had to reuse the same class. Is there a way in Python to mark a class as \"private\" or \"internal\"? I am aware of the underscore mechanism, but my understanding is that it only applies to variables, function and methods name."

        "content": "In Python, you can use naming conventions to indicate that a class or function is intended for internal use within a module, even though Python does not enforce access restrictions as strictly as some other languages do.\n\nTo denote a class as \"private\" or \"internal\" within a module, you can use the following strategies:\n\n1. **Single Underscore Prefix (_):**\n   Prefix the class name with a single underscore. This is a conventional way to indicate that the class is intended for internal use only and should not be accessed from outside the module.\n\n   ```python\n   class _InternalClass:\n       def __init__(self):\n           pass\n\n   def public_function():\n       instance = _InternalClass()\n       # Use the instance as needed\n   ```\n\n2. **Double Underscore (Name Mangling):**\n   Use a double underscore prefix to invoke name mangling, which makes it harder (but not impossible) to access the class from outside the module. However, this is more commonly used for class attributes and methods rather than class names.\n\n3. **Module's `__all__` Attribute:**\n   Define the `__all__` variable in your module to explicitly declare which classes, functions, and variables are part of the public API. Any names not included in `__all__` will be considered internal when the module is imported using `from module import *`.\n\n   ```python\n   __all__ = ['public_function']\n\n   class _InternalClass:\n       def __init__(self):\n           pass\n\n   def public_function():\n       instance = _InternalClass()\n       # Use the instance as needed\n   ```\n\nThese conventions rely on the discipline of other developers to respect the intended encapsulation, as Python does not enforce strict access controls like private or protected modifiers in languages like Java or C#. However, they are widely recognized and followed in the Python community."
