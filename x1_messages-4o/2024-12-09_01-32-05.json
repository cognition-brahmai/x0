Specifically, I want to shade the region from x=-1 to x=1 given the following plot:\n\n```\nimport numpy as np\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\ndef f(t):\n    return t * t\n\nt = np.arange(-4,4,1/40.)\nplt.plot(t,f(t))\n```"

        "content": "To illustrate the definite integral between two regions by shading the area under the curve using `matplotlib`, you can use the `fill_between` function. This function allows you to fill the area between two horizontal curves, which is perfect for shading the region under a single curve from one x-value to another.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to shade the region under the curve \\( f(t) = t^2 \\) from \\( x = -1 \\) to \\( x = 1 \\):\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n\ndef f(t):\n    return t * t\n\n# Create an array of t values\nt = np.arange(-4, 4, 1/40.)\n# Plot the function\nplt.plot(t, f(t), label='f(t) = t^2')\n\n# Shade the area under the curve from x = -1 to x = 1\nplt.fill_between(t, f(t), where=(t >= -1) & (t <= 1), color='skyblue', alpha=0.5, label='Area from x=-1 to x=1')\n\n# Add labels and a legend\nplt.xlabel('t')\nplt.ylabel('f(t)')\nplt.title('Shaded Area Under Curve')\nplt.axhline(0, color='black',linewidth=0.5)\nplt.axvline(0, color='black',linewidth=0.5)\nplt.legend()\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`fill_between`**: This function is used to fill the area between the curve `f(t)` and the x-axis. The `where` parameter specifies the condition for which the filling should occur. In this case, it's between `t >= -1` and `t <= 1`.\n- **`color` and `alpha`**: These parameters control the color and transparency of the shaded region, respectively. You can adjust these to your liking.\n\nThis code will create a plot of the function \\( f(t) = t^2 \\) and shade the area under this curve between \\( x = -1 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\), visually representing the definite integral of the function over that interval."
