        "content": "To configure your IPython Notebook (now known as Jupyter Notebook) to automatically run the `%matplotlib inline` command every time you launch it, you can create a startup script that executes this command. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Locate or Create the Startup Directory:**\n   The IPython/Jupyter configuration files are typically located in the `.ipython` directory in your home folder. You need to create a `startup` folder if it doesn't already exist.\n\n   On Linux or MacOS:\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p ~/.ipython/profile_default/startup\n   ```\n\n   On Windows, open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:\n   ```bash\n   mkdir %USERPROFILE%\\.ipython\\profile_default\\startup\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a Startup Script:**\n   Inside the `startup` directory, create a new Python file. You can name it anything, but it should have a `.py` extension. For example, you can name it `00-startup.py`.\n\n   In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the `startup` directory and create the file:\n   ```bash\n   touch ~/.ipython/profile_default/startup/00-startup.py\n   ```\n\n   Alternatively, you can create the file using any text editor.\n\n3. **Add the Command to the Startup Script:**\n   Open the `00-startup.py` file in a text editor and add the following line:\n   ```python\n   # This will automatically make matplotlib plots inline in Jupyter Notebooks\n   get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')\n   ```\n\n4. **Save and Close the File:**\n   After adding the line, save the file and close the text editor.\n\nNow, every time you start a new Jupyter Notebook, it will automatically run the `%matplotlib inline` command, making your matplotlib plots display inline by default.\n\nThis configuration only affects the specific profile where you place the startup script. If you have multiple profiles, you need to repeat these steps for each profile you wish to configure."
