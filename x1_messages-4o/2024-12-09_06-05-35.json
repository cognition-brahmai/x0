However, each new name is being appended directly after the previous one, rather than on a new line. For example, if I run the function and enter \"Ryan\", then run it again and enter \"Bob\", the text file looks like \"RyanBob\" instead of having \"Ryan\" on one line and \"Bob\" on the next. How can I modify my code so that each new name is written on a new line in the text file? Here is my current code:\n\n```python\ndef storescores():\n    hs = open(\"hst.txt\",\"a\")\n    hs.write(name)\n    hs.close() \n```"

        "content": "To ensure that each new name is written on a new line, you need to add a newline character (`\\n`) after each name. This will move the cursor to the next line in the text file after writing the name. You can modify your function like this:\n\n```python\ndef storescores(name):\n    with open(\"hst.txt\", \"a\") as hs:\n        hs.write(name + \"\\n\")\n```\n\nA few enhancements have been made here:\n\n1. **Adding `\\n`**: This ensures that each name is followed by a newline character, placing subsequent names on new lines.\n\n2. **Using `with` statement**: This is a more Pythonic way to handle file operations as it automatically closes the file for you, even if an error occurs during the file operation.\n\nMake sure to pass the `name` variable as an argument when calling your function:\n\n```python\nstorescores(\"Ryan\")\nstorescores(\"Bob\")\n```\n\nThis way, each name you add will be on a new line in the `hst.txt` file."
