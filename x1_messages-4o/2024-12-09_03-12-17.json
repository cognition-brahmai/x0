The format I'm using is as follows:\n\n```\nimport fileinput\n\nfor lines in fileinput.FileInput(\"test.txt\", inplace=1):\n    lines = lines.strip()\n    if lines == '': continue\n    print lines\n```\nHowever, I'm facing an issue where nothing is being printed on stdout. I also have a string named `foo` for which I'm using:\n\n```\nfoo.lstrip() # to remove leading white space\nfoo.rstrip() # to remove trailing whitespace\nfoo.strip()  # to remove both lead and trailing whitespace\n```\nBut it doesn't seem to be working as expected. Can you guide me on how to correct this?"

        "content": "Let's address both parts of your question, starting with the script for removing trailing whitespace from a file.\n\n### File Processing Script\n\nThe script you provided uses `fileinput` to modify the file in place. However, there are a few considerations to ensure it works correctly:\n\n1. **Python 3 Print Function**: Ensure you're using the correct syntax for the `print` function if you're using Python 3. You need to use parentheses.\n\n2. **Avoid Empty Lines**: You have a condition to skip empty lines, so ensure your logic aligns with your expectations.\n\nHere's an updated version of your script suitable for Python 3:\n\n```python\nimport fileinput\n\nfor line in fileinput.FileInput(\"test.txt\", inplace=True, backup='.bak'):\n    line = line.rstrip()\n    if line:  # This skips empty lines\n        print(line)\n```\n\n### String Whitespace Removal\n\nFor the string operations you're attempting with `foo`, ensure that you're using the results returned by the string methods. String methods like `strip()`, `lstrip()`, and `rstrip()` do not modify the original string in place; they return a new string.\n\nHere's how you can use them correctly:\n\n```python\nfoo = \"   some text with spaces   \"\n\n# To remove leading whitespace\nfoo = foo.lstrip()\n\n# To remove trailing whitespace\nfoo = foo.rstrip()\n\n# To remove both leading and trailing whitespace\nfoo = foo.strip()\n\nprint(foo)\n```\n\nMake sure to assign the result of these operations back to `foo` (or another variable) to see the changes. If `foo` doesn't appear to change, it might be because you're not using the returned value."
