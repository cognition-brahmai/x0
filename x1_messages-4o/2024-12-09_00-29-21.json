For instance, If I have a module `foo` with a function `bar`, is there a way for `bar` to know its own name or even the name `foo.bar` when executing `foo.bar()`? Here's an example of what I'm trying to achieve:\n\n```python\n#foo.py  \ndef bar():\n    print \"my name is\", __myname__ # <== how do I calculate this at runtime?\n```"

        "content": "In Python, you can determine a function's name from within that function by using the special attribute `__name__`. However, determining the fully qualified name, including the module name, requires a little more work. You can achieve this by combining the `__name__` attribute of the function with the `__name__` attribute of the module, which can be accessed via the global variable `__name__` within the module. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# foo.py\ndef bar():\n    # Get the module name\n    module_name = __name__\n    \n    # Get the function name\n    function_name = bar.__name__\n    \n    # Combine them to get the fully qualified name\n    full_name = f\"{module_name}.{function_name}\"\n    \n    print(\"my name is\", full_name)\n\n# Example usage\nbar()\n```\n\nWhen you run this script, it will output:\n\n```\nmy name is foo.bar\n```\n\nIf you run this function from the same module, `__name__` will be `\"__main__\"`, so the output will be `\"my name is __main__.bar\"`. To get the correct module name when the function is called from another module, ensure that the module `foo` is imported, and the function is called as `foo.bar()`."
