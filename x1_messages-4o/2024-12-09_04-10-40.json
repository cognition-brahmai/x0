        "content": "I am encountering an issue with Python's `is` operator behaving differently with non-cached integers when used inside a function versus outside a function. When I define two variables with the same value inside a function, the `is` operator returns `True`, indicating they point to the same object. However, when I define them outside the function, it returns `False`, indicating they point to different objects. Here's the code I used:\n\n```python\ndef func():\n    a = 1000\n    b = 1000\n    return a is b\n\na = 1000\nb = 1000\nprint(a is b, func())  # Output: (False, True)\n```\n\nI understand the difference between identity (`is`) and equality (`==`) operations and I'm aware of Python's integer caching for the range `[-5, 256]`. But in this case, the integers I'm using are outside that range and I'm interested in evaluating identity, not equality. Why does the `is` operator behave this way?"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing with the `is` operator in Python is related to how Python optimizes memory usage when dealing with immutable objects like integers. The key concept here is that Python's memory management can behave differently based on the context in which variables are used, and this can sometimes lead to seemingly inconsistent behavior with the `is` operator.\n\nHere's what's happening in your code:\n\n1. **Outside the Function**: \n   - When `a = 1000` and `b = 1000` are defined outside any function, they are separate assignments, and Python does not perform any optimization to make them point to the same memory location. Therefore, `a is b` evaluates to `False` because they are two distinct objects in memory.\n\n2. **Inside the Function**: \n   - When you define `a = 1000` and `b = 1000` inside the function, Python's compiler may perform an optimization by reusing the same object for `a` and `b` within the function scope. This is because within a single function execution, Python can sometimes optimize and reuse immutable objects, so `a is b` evaluates to `True`.\n\nThis behavior is due to Python's internal optimizations, which can vary between different implementations and versions of Python. The Python interpreter may choose to optimize memory usage by reusing immutable objects like integers, but these optimizations are not guaranteed to occur outside of certain contexts (such as small integers or within a single function call).\n\nTherefore, when dealing with integers outside the cached range, it's usually better to rely on equality (`==`) rather than identity (`is`) unless you specifically need to check if two variables point to the exact same object."
