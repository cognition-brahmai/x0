However, your friend wants to ensure that no two guests show up in the same costume theme and accessory combination. \nCan you come up with an algorithm to randomly assign a costume theme and accessory combination to each guest in a way that guarantees no two guests have the same combination? \nRemember, you want to make sure that every guest feels unique and creative in their costume, so be careful with your algorithm!"

        "content": "Certainly! To ensure that no two guests have the same costume theme and accessory combination, we can use a simple algorithm to randomly assign each guest a unique combination. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n1. **List Creation**:\n   - Create a list of all possible combinations of costume themes and accessories. If there are 5 costume themes and 2 accessory options for each, you will have a total of 5 * 2 = 10 unique combinations.\n\n2. **Combination Generation**:\n   - For example, if the themes are A, B, C, D, E and accessories are 1, 2, then the combinations would be:\n     - A1, A2\n     - B1, B2\n     - C1, C2\n     - D1, D2\n     - E1, E2\n\n3. **Randomization**:\n   - Shuffle the list of combinations to randomize the order. This can be done using a random shuffle algorithm which is available in most programming languages.\n\n4. **Assignment**:\n   - Assign each guest a combination from the shuffled list. Since the list is randomized, each assignment will be unique.\n\n5. **Check**:\n   - Ensure that the number of guests does not exceed the total number of unique combinations. If there are more guests than combinations, you will need to either add more themes/accessories or limit the guest list.\n\nHere's a pseudo-code example of the algorithm:\n\n```plaintext\nfunction assignCostumeThemesAndAccessories(guests, themes, accessories):\n    combinations = []\n    \n    for each theme in themes:\n        for each accessory in accessories:\n            combinations.append(theme + accessory)\n    \n    shuffle(combinations)\n    \n    if length(guests) > length(combinations):\n        print(\"Error: More guests than available unique combinations.\")\n        return\n    \n    assignment = {}\n    for i from 0 to length(guests) - 1:\n        assignment[guests[i]] = combinations[i]\n    \n    return assignment\n```\n\nThis algorithm ensures that each guest receives a unique costume and accessory combination, making the party a creative and enjoyable experience."
