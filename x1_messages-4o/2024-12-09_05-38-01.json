While this works for most of the text strings, I am encountering a TypeError stating that the text string is not JSON serializable. Here is the error message: \n<pre><code>TypeError: b'Pizza is a flatbread generally topped with tomato sauce and cheese and baked in an oven. It is commonly topped with a selection of meats, vegetables and condiments. The term was first recorded in the 10th century, in a Latin manuscript from Gaeta in Central Italy. The modern pizza was invented in Naples, Italy, and the dish and its variants have since become popular in many areas of the world.\\nIn 2009, upon Italy\\'s request, Neapolitan pizza was safeguarded in the European Union as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed dish. The Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (the True Neapolitan Pizza Association) is a non-profit organization founded in 1984 with headquarters in Naples. It promotes and protects the \"true Neapolitan pizza\".\\nPizza is sold fresh, frozen or in portions, and is a common fast food item in North America and the United Kingdom. Various types of ovens are used to cook them and many varieties exist. Several similar dishes are prepared from ingredients commonly used in pizza preparation, such as calzone and stromboli.' is not JSON serializable\n</code></pre>\nCould you please explain why this is happening and how to resolve it?"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering indicates that you are trying to serialize a byte string (indicated by the `b'...'` prefix) into a JSON string, which is not directly possible. JSON serialization requires the data to be in a format that can be converted to JSON, typically a string, dict, list, int, float, or `None` in Python. Byte strings are not directly serializable to JSON.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Decode the Byte String:** If the content you are trying to serialize is a byte string, you need to decode it to a regular string. You can do this using the `.decode()` method.\n\n2. **Ensure Everything is JSON-Serializable:** Make sure that all data you are trying to include in your JSON is in a JSON-serializable format.\n\nHere's an example of how you can decode the byte string and then serialize it to JSON:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Example byte string\nbyte_string = b'Pizza is a flatbread generally topped with tomato sauce and cheese...'\n\n# Decode the byte string to a regular string\ntext_string = byte_string.decode('utf-8')  # Use the appropriate encoding\n\n# Create a dictionary or any JSON-serializable structure\ndata = {\"description\": text_string}\n\n# Serialize the data to JSON\njson_string = json.dumps(data)\n\nprint(json_string)\n```\n\nIn this example, `byte_string.decode('utf-8')` is used to convert the byte string to a regular string, which is JSON-serializable. Make sure to use the correct character encoding (here `'utf-8'` is used, which is a common encoding). Once the data is a regular string, it can be serialized into a JSON string using `json.dumps()`.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional help, feel free to ask!"
