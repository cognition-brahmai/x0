        "content": "In Flask, when you receive GET data, it's typically parsed from the query string of the URL, and you access it using the `request.args` object. However, by default, the values in `request.args` are strings, and you need to parse them yourself if you're dealing with nested data structures like arrays or dictionaries.\n\nHere's how you can retrieve GET data sent in the form of an array or a nested structure in Flask:\n\n1. **Simple List**: If you're sending a list as part of your GET request, you can do this by repeating the query parameter. For example, your URL might look like this: `http://example.com/?key=value1&key=value2`. You can then access this in Flask as follows:\n\n   ```python\n   from flask import Flask, request\n\n   app = Flask(__name__)\n\n   @app.route('/')\n   def index():\n       # Get list of values for 'key'\n       values = request.args.getlist('key')\n       return f\"Values: {values}\"\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       app.run(debug=True)\n   ```\n\n   This will output `Values: ['value1', 'value2']`.\n\n2. **Nested Structures**: If you want to mimic the PHP-like nested array structure (e.g., `$_GET['key1']['key2']`), you would need to encode the data in a way that you can parse it back into a nested structure on the server-side.\n\n   One common method is to use JSON. You can send JSON-encoded data in a single query parameter and then decode it in Flask:\n\n   - **Client-side**: Send the data as a JSON string:\n     ```\n     http://example.com/?data={\"key1\": {\"key2\": \"value\"}}\n     ```\n\n   - **Server-side**: Parse the JSON string into a dictionary:\n     ```python\n     import json\n     from flask import Flask, request\n\n     app = Flask(__name__)\n\n     @app.route('/')\n     def index():\n         data_str = request.args.get('data')\n         if data_str:\n             try:\n                 data = json.loads(data_str)\n                 key2_value = data.get('key1', {}).get('key2', None)\n                 return f\"Value for key2: {key2_value}\"\n             except json.JSONDecodeError:\n                 return \"Invalid JSON data\", 400\n         return \"No data provided\", 400\n\n     if __name__ == '__main__':\n         app.run(debug=True)\n     ```\n\n   This will correctly parse the nested JSON data and allow you to access it as if it were a nested dictionary.\n\nRemember to handle errors properly, such as invalid JSON, and consider security implications when parsing data directly from query strings."
