I have a list like this:\n\n```python\nletters = ['a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h','i','j']\n```\n\nI want to insert an 'x' after every nth element, let's say three characters in that list. How can I achieve this in a Pythonic way, possibly in a single line of code?"

        "content": "You can achieve this by using a list comprehension along with the `enumerate` function. Here's a Pythonic one-liner that inserts an 'x' after every third element in your list:\n\n```python\nletters = ['a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h','i','j']\nn = 3\nresult = [item for index, item in enumerate(letters, 1) for item in (item, 'x') if index % n != 0] + ['x']\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will produce the following output:\n\n```\n['a', 'b', 'c', 'x', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'x', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'x', 'j', 'x']\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n- The `enumerate` function is used to provide indices starting from 1.\n- The list comprehension iterates over each element and its index.\n- For every element, it checks if the index is not a multiple of `n`. If true, it adds both the element and 'x' to the result.\n- The `+ ['x']` at the end ensures that an 'x' is added after the last set if needed."
