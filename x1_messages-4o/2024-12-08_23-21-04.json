Let's do that with the given numbers:\n\n8, 10, 15, 22, 65\n\nThe median is the middle number in a list when the numbers are arranged in order. Since we have five numbers, the median will be the third number in this ordered list.\n\nSo, the median of these numbers is 15.\n\nThe median is a measure of central tendency, which represents the middle value of a data set. It divides the data into two halves, with half of the numbers being smaller than the median and the other half being larger. The median is particularly useful in understanding the distribution of a data set, especially when it contains outliers or is skewed, as it is not affected by extremely large or small values."
