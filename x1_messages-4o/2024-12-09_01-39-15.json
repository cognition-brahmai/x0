Currently, I only know how to convert time in the format \"hh:mm:ss\" using the following Python code:\n\n```python\ndef time_to_num(time_str):\n    hh, mm , ss = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n    return ss + 60*(mm + 60*hh)\n```\nBut I don't know how to include the date."

        "content": "To convert a datetime string in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss\" into an integer, you need to consider both the date and time components. A common approach is to convert the entire datetime to a timestamp, which is an integer representing the number of seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC).\n\nHere's how you can achieve this using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef datetime_to_num(datetime_str):\n    # Parse the string into a datetime object\n    dt = datetime.strptime(datetime_str, \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n    # Convert the datetime object to a timestamp (number of seconds since the epoch)\n    timestamp = int(dt.timestamp())\n    return timestamp\n\n# Example usage\ndatetime_str = \"2014-02-12 20:51:14\"\nprint(datetime_to_num(datetime_str))\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- The `strptime` method is used to parse the datetime string into a `datetime` object.\n- The `timestamp` method converts the `datetime` object into a timestamp, which is the number of seconds since the Unix epoch. This timestamp is then converted to an integer.\n\nThis method will give you a unique integer representation of the entire datetime."
