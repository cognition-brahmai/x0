I am able to connect using basic authentication but I'm having trouble figuring out how to connect with a public key. When I connect with PuTTY, the server provides the following message:\n\n```\nUsing username \"root\".\nAuthenticating with public key \"rsa-key@ddddd.com\"\nPassphrase for key \"rsa-key@ddddd.com\": [i've inserted the passphrase here]\nLast login: Mon Dec 5 09:25:18 2011 from ...\n```\n\nI connect to it with the following ppk file:\n\n```\nPuTTY-User-Key-File-2: ssh-rsa\nEncryption: aes256-cbc\nComment: rsa-key@dddd.com\nPublic-Lines: 4\n[4 lines key]\nPrivate-Lines: 8\n[8 lines key]\nPrivate-MAC: [hash]\n```\n\nHowever, with basic auth the error I get (from the log) is:\n\n```\nDEB [20111205-09:48:44.328] thr=1   paramiko.transport: userauth is OK\nDEB [20111205-09:48:44.927] thr=1   paramiko.transport: Authentication type (password) not permitted.\nDEB [20111205-09:48:44.927] thr=1   paramiko.transport: Allowed methods: ['publickey', 'gssapi-with-mic']\n```\n\nI've tried to include the ppk file and set to `auth_public_key`, but it didn't work. How can I successfully connect using the public key?"

        "content": "To connect to a server using SSH with a public key through Python's Paramiko library, you need to ensure that you are converting your `.ppk` file (PuTTY Private Key) to a format that Paramiko can use, such as the OpenSSH format. Paramiko does not natively support `.ppk` files, so you will need to convert it to a standard private key format first.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Convert the `.ppk` file to OpenSSH format:**\n\n   You can use PuTTYgen to convert your `.ppk` file to an OpenSSH key format. Here\u2019s how:\n\n   - Open PuTTYgen.\n   - Load your `.ppk` file by clicking \"Load\".\n   - Once the key is loaded, click on \"Conversions\" and select \"Export OpenSSH key\".\n   - Save the private key to a file, e.g., `id_rsa`.\n\n2. **Use Paramiko to connect with the OpenSSH private key:**\n\n   Once you have the private key in OpenSSH format, you can use Paramiko to connect to your server. Here's a sample script for doing that:\n\n   ```python\n   import paramiko\n\n   # Path to the converted OpenSSH private key file\n   private_key_path = '/path/to/your/id_rsa'\n\n   # Optional: If your private key is encrypted, you will need to provide the passphrase\n   passphrase = 'your_passphrase'\n\n   # Create an SSH client\n   client = paramiko.SSHClient()\n\n   # Automatically add the server's host key (not recommended for production)\n   client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())\n\n   # Load the private key\n   private_key = paramiko.RSAKey.from_private_key_file(private_key_path, password=passphrase)\n\n   # Connect to the server\n   try:\n       client.connect(\n           hostname='your.server.com',\n           username='root',\n           pkey=private_key\n       )\n       print(\"Connected successfully!\")\n\n       # Execute a command (optional)\n       stdin, stdout, stderr = client.exec_command('ls -l')\n       print(stdout.read().decode())\n\n   finally:\n       # Close the connection\n       client.close()\n   ```\n\nMake sure to replace `/path/to/your/id_rsa`, `your_passphrase`, and `your.server.com` with your actual private key path, passphrase, and server address, respectively.\n\nThis should allow you to connect to your server using public key authentication with Paramiko."
