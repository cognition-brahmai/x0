However, I am having some difficulty as most examples and tutorials I have found involve conversion from a string, which is not what I need. I need to build an array of bytes like `0xA2 0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04`. I come from a C/C++ background and my current attempt does not seem to work. This is the code I've tried:\n\n```python\nframe = b\"\"\nframe += bytes( int('0xA2',16) )\nframe += bytes( int('0x01',16) )\nframe += bytes( int('0x02',16) )\nframe += bytes( int('0x03',16) )\nframe += bytes( int('0x04',16) )\n```\nWhen I try to send this frame variable to the send method of socket, it doesn't work as expected because the frame doesn't contain what I want. Can you guide me on how to correctly build an array of bytes in Python?"

        "content": "Certainly! In Python, you can directly build a byte array using the `bytes` type by providing a list of integer values that represent the byte values. Each value in this list should be in the range of 0 to 255, which corresponds to a single byte. Here's how you can construct your desired byte array:\n\n```python\n# Creating a byte array with the desired byte values\nframe = bytes([0xA2, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04])\n\n# Alternatively, using a bytearray which is mutable\n# frame = bytearray([0xA2, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04])\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `bytes([0xA2, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04])` directly creates an immutable bytes object from the list of integers.\n- If you need a mutable version (which allows you to change the bytes after creation), you can use `bytearray` instead of `bytes`.\n\n### Sending over a socket:\nYou can then send this `frame` using a socket's `send` method. Here's a brief example of how you might do that:\n\n```python\nimport socket\n\n# Create a TCP/IP socket\nsock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n\n# Connect the socket to the server's address\nserver_address = ('localhost', 10000)  # Example server address\nsock.connect(server_address)\n\ntry:\n    # Send the frame\n    sock.sendall(frame)\nfinally:\n    # Close the socket\n    sock.close()\n```\n\nThis code will correctly create a byte array containing the specified values and send it over a TCP connection. Ensure that your server is set up to receive and process the data correctly."
