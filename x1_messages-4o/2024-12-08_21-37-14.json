        "content": "To remove duplicate words from a sentence, you can use Python to split the sentence into individual words, then use a data structure like a set to filter out duplicates, and finally join the words back together. Here's a simple Python program to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicate_words(sentence):\n    # Split the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n    \n    # Use a set to track seen words and a list to maintain order\n    seen = set()\n    unique_words = []\n    \n    for word in words:\n        # If the word is not in the set, add it to the list and the set\n        if word not in seen:\n            unique_words.append(word)\n            seen.add(word)\n    \n    # Join the unique words back into a sentence\n    return ' '.join(unique_words)\n\n# Example usage\nsentence = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The lazy dog jumps over the brown fox.\"\nresult = remove_duplicate_words(sentence)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `remove_duplicate_words` that takes a sentence as input and returns a new sentence with duplicate words removed, maintaining the original order of their first occurrences. When you run the example, it will print the sentence without duplicate words."
