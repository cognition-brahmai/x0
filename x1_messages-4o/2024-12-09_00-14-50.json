Specifically, I would like the learning rate of the last fully connected layer to be 10^-3, while the learning rate for the other layers should be set to 10^-6. I am aware of the method in the PyTorch documentation that allows me to do this: \n```python\noptim.SGD([{'params': model.base.parameters()},\n           {'params': model.classifier.parameters(), 'lr': 1e-3}], \n          lr=1e-2, momentum=0.9)\n```\nHowever, I'm wondering if there is a way to set these parameters without having to do it layer by layer."

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this by using parameter groups in PyTorch's optimizer. The method you're referring to is actually quite flexible and doesn't require you to set the learning rate for each layer individually, but rather for groups of layers. Here's how you can set different learning rates for the last fully connected layer and the rest of the layers in a ResNet50 model:\n\n1. **Access the Layers:**\n   First, identify the layers you want to apply a different learning rate to. In the case of ResNet50, the last fully connected layer is usually `model.fc`.\n\n2. **Create Parameter Groups:**\n   You can group the parameters into two categories: the fully connected (fc) layer and all other layers. \n\nHere's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.optim as optim\nfrom torchvision import models\n\n# Load a pre-trained ResNet50 model\nmodel = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)\n\n# Define parameter groups\n# All layers except the final fully connected layer\nbase_params = [param for name, param in model.named_parameters() if \"fc\" not in name]\n\n# Final fully connected layer\nfc_params = model.fc.parameters()\n\n# Set up the optimizer with different learning rates\noptimizer = optim.SGD([\n    {'params': base_params, 'lr': 1e-6},\n    {'params': fc_params, 'lr': 1e-3}\n], momentum=0.9)\n\n# Now you can use this optimizer in your training loop\n```\n\nIn this code, `model.named_parameters()` is used to get all the parameters of the model along with their names. By checking if the parameter's name does not contain `\"fc\"`, you can group all the parameters except the fully connected layer's parameters.\n\nThis approach allows you to set learning rates for groups of layers without having to specify each layer individually, and it is especially useful for models with a large number of layers."
