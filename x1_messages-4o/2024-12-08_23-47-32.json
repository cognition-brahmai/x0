        "content": "To create an Excel table that categorizes fruits as \"acidic\" or \"non-acidic\" based on their pH levels, you can use the `IF` function to determine the acidity. Based on the provided data, here's how you can set up the table and formula:\n\n1. Open Excel and create a table with the following headers: \"Fruits\", \"pH Level\", and \"Acidity\".\n\n2. Enter the data as follows:\n\n   | Fruits | pH Level | Acidity     |\n   |--------|----------|-------------|\n   | Orange | 3.5      |             |\n   | Apple  | 3.3      |             |\n   | Banana | 5.2      |             |\n   | Lemon  | 2.0      |             |\n\n3. In the \"Acidity\" column, you'll enter the formula to determine the acidity based on the pH level. Assuming the pH levels are in column B, starting from row 2, enter the following formula in cell C2:\n\n   ```excel\n   =IF(B2<4,\"Acidic\",\"Non-Acidic\")\n   ```\n\n4. Drag the formula down from cell C2 to C5 to apply it to all the rows.\n\n5. After applying the formula, your table should look like this:\n\n   | Fruits | pH Level | Acidity     |\n   |--------|----------|-------------|\n   | Orange | 3.5      | Acidic      |\n   | Apple  | 3.3      | Acidic      |\n   | Banana | 5.2      | Non-Acidic  |\n   | Lemon  | 2.0      | Acidic      |\n\nThis setup categorizes each fruit as \"Acidic\" if its pH level is less than 4, otherwise as \"Non-Acidic\"."
