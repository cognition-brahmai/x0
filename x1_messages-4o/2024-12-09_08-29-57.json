Here's how you can achieve both conversions:\n\n1. **Dictionary to a list of tuples (key, value):**\n\n   You can use the `items()` method of the dictionary to get key-value pairs and then convert them into a list of tuples directly.\n\n   ```python\n   my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n   list_of_tuples = list(my_dict.items())\n   print(list_of_tuples)\n   ```\n\n   This will produce the output:\n\n   ```\n   [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]\n   ```\n\n2. **Dictionary to a list of tuples (value, key):**\n\n   You can use a list comprehension to reverse the order of elements in each tuple.\n\n   ```python\n   my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n   reversed_list_of_tuples = [(value, key) for key, value in my_dict.items()]\n   print(reversed_list_of_tuples)\n   ```\n\n   This will produce the output:\n\n   ```\n   [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]\n   ```\n\nBoth methods utilize the `items()` method to iterate over key-value pairs, allowing you to format them as needed."
