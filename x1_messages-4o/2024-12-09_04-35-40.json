I am currently using `df.dtypes` to accomplish this, but the output is not complete. I've tried setting options like `display.max_row`, `display.max_info_row`, `display.max_info_columns` but none of them seem to work. The current output I'm getting is as follows:\n\n```python\nprint df.dtypes\n#>\nDate         object\nSelection    object\nResult       object\n...\nprofit    float64\nPL        float64\ncumPL     float64\nLength: 11, dtype: object\n```\n\nI'm using pandas version `0.13.1`. What could I possibly be doing wrong here?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing could be due to the settings in your Pandas configuration that limit the number of rows or columns displayed in the output. In older versions of Pandas, like `0.13.1`, the default settings might truncate the output for lengthy dataframes.\n\nHere are a few things you can try to ensure you are displaying all the data types of your dataframe's columns:\n\n1. **Upgrade Pandas**: Your current version is quite old. Newer versions of Pandas have improved functionality and better default settings. If possible, consider upgrading to a more recent version by running:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade pandas\n   ```\n\n2. **Adjust Display Options**: Since you've already attempted to set display options, make sure you've set them correctly. You can set these options to a large enough number to ensure all data types are displayed:\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n   pd.set_option('display.max_rows', None)  # Set to None to display all rows\n   pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)  # Set to None to display all columns\n   pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', None)  # Set to None to display all column width\n   ```\n\n3. **Use `to_string()` Method**: This method can force the display of all columns without truncation:\n   ```python\n   print(df.dtypes.to_string())\n   ```\n\n4. **Check DataFrame Information**: Using the `info()` method can also give a quick summary of all columns and their data types:\n   ```python\n   df.info()\n   ```\n\n5. **Access the Series Directly**: The `dtypes` attribute returns a Series, and you can convert this Series to a string or list to ensure all data types are captured:\n   ```python\n   data_types = df.dtypes\n   print(data_types.to_string())  # Or convert to list\n   ```\n\nIf none of these solutions work, it might be a limitation of the older version of Pandas you are using, and upgrading to a newer version would be the most reliable solution."
