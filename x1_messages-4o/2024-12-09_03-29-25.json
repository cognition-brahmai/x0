For instance, if I have a string line = \"Name Age Group Class Profession\", how can I insert the 3rd field (Group) three more times into the same line before the Class field? The output line should look like this: \"Name Age Group Group Group Group Class Profession\". I am able to retrieve the 3rd field using the split method, but what is the easiest way to insert it into the string?"

Here's a step-by-step guide to insert the 3rd field (Group) three more times into the string before the \"Class\" field:\n\n1. Split the original string into a list of words.\n2. Identify the index of the \"Class\" field.\n3. Insert the \"Group\" field three times before the \"Class\" field.\n4. Join the list back into a string.\n\nHere's a sample code to do that:\n\n```python\n# Original string\nline = \"Name Age Group Class Profession\"\n\n# Split the string into a list of words\nwords = line.split()\n\n# Identify the index of the \"Class\" field\nclass_index = words.index(\"Class\")\n\n# Retrieve the \"Group\" field\ngroup_field = words[2]\n\n# Insert the \"Group\" field three more times before the \"Class\" field\nfor _ in range(3):\n    words.insert(class_index, group_field)\n\n# Join the list back into a string\noutput_line = ' '.join(words)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(output_line)\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n\n```\nName Age Group Group Group Group Class Profession\n```\n\nThis approach efficiently inserts the \"Group\" field at the specified position multiple times."
