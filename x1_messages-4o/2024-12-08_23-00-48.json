This allows us to compare each day's price to the previous day's price.\n\n2. **Collect**: We use `collect` with a pattern matching case to filter out only those prices where the current day's price is higher than the previous day's price.\n\n3. **Calculate Average**: We compute the average of these filtered prices. If there are no such days, we handle the case by returning 0.0.\n\nThis code ensures that only days where the Bitcoin price is higher than the previous day are considered when calculating the average daily price."
