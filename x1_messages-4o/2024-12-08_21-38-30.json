The sequence of the first 50 odd integers is: 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., 99.\n\nThe formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is:\n\n\\[\nS_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a + l)\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( S_n \\) is the sum of the series,\n- \\( n \\) is the number of terms,\n- \\( a \\) is the first term,\n- \\( l \\) is the last term.\n\nFor this sequence:\n- \\( n = 50 \\),\n- \\( a = 1 \\),\n- \\( l = 99 \\).\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\nS_{50} = \\frac{50}{2} \\times (1 + 99) = 25 \\times 100 = 2500\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum of the first 50 odd integers greater than 0 is 2500."
