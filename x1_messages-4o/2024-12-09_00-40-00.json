Here are a few ways you can achieve this:\n\n### Using `sort` and `uniq` in Unix/Linux:\n\n1. **Command-line Approach:**\n\n   You can use the `sort` and `uniq` commands together. `sort` will sort the lines, and `uniq` will remove any duplicate lines.\n\n   ```bash\n   sort filename.txt | uniq > outputfile.txt\n   ```\n\n   This will create a new file `outputfile.txt` that contains only unique lines from `filename.txt`.\n\n2. **In-place Editing (GNU tools):**\n\n   If you want to modify the file in place, you can use the `-o` option of the `sort` command with `uniq`:\n\n   ```bash\n   sort filename.txt | uniq -u > temp.txt && mv temp.txt filename.txt\n   ```\n\n### Using Python:\n\nIf you prefer using a script, you can use Python to remove duplicate lines:\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(input_file, output_file):\n    with open(input_file, 'r') as file:\n        lines = file.readlines()\n\n    unique_lines = set(lines)\n    \n    with open(output_file, 'w') as file:\n        file.writelines(unique_lines)\n\n# Usage\nremove_duplicates('filename.txt', 'outputfile.txt')\n```\n\n### Using AWK:\n\nAWK is another powerful text-processing tool available in Unix/Linux environments.\n\n```bash\nawk '!seen[$0]++' filename.txt > outputfile.txt\n```\n\nThis command will output only the first occurrence of each line to `outputfile.txt`.\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **`sort` and `uniq`** are straightforward and effective for simple tasks.\n- **Python** offers more flexibility, especially useful if you need to integrate this functionality into a larger script.\n- **AWK** is another quick and efficient method for Unix/Linux environments.\n\nChoose the method that best fits your environment and needs."
