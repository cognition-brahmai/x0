I call the script using the following code:\n\n```javascript\nlet py = spawn('python',['ResolvePosition.py', obsFilePath, navFilePath])\npy.stdout.on('data', data => console.log('data : ', data.toString()))\npy.on('close', ()=> {\n  // Python ends, do stuff\n})\n```\n\nThis code works fine when I run my Electron app with `npm start`. However, when I build an executable for Windows using the npm module `electron-builder` and run the executable from `dist/win-unpacked/my-app.exe`, it doesn't work. It seems that my script is not accessible with `python ./my-script-py`. How can I make this code work for the built project?"

        "content": "When creating an executable for your Electron application, the paths and the environment in which your app runs can differ significantly from the development environment. Here are some steps and tips to ensure your Python script runs correctly in the packaged application:\n\n1. **Absolute Paths**: Ensure that you're using absolute paths to reference your Python script. When you run your app from a built executable, the working directory might not be the root of your project. You can use Node.js's `path` module to construct an absolute path.\n\n    ```javascript\n    const path = require('path');\n\n    const pythonScriptPath = path.join(__dirname, 'ResolvePosition.py');\n    let py = spawn('python', [pythonScriptPath, obsFilePath, navFilePath]);\n    ```\n\n2. **Bundling Python Script**: Ensure that your Python script is included in the resources of your packaged application. You might need to specify the script in the `files` section of your `package.json` so that `electron-builder` includes it in the build.\n\n    ```json\n    \"build\": {\n      \"files\": [\n        \"path/to/ResolvePosition.py\",\n        // other files or directories to include\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n3. **Python Environment**: Ensure that the target machine has Python installed, and the path to the Python executable is correctly set in the environment variables. Alternatively, consider using a bundled Python environment if you need control over the Python version and dependencies.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: Add error handling to debug by capturing `stderr` stream output from the Python script:\n\n    ```javascript\n    py.stderr.on('data', data => console.error('error: ', data.toString()));\n    py.on('error', error => console.error('Failed to start subprocess.', error));\n    ```\n\n5. **Check Execution Environment**: If the Python script relies on external files or environment variables, ensure they are accessible and correctly set in the environment where the executable runs.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to execute your Python script from the packaged Electron app. If issues persist, consider logging additional information to debug further."
