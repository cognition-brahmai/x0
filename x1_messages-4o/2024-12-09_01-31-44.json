        "content": "To insert a breakpoint in your Python source code and have it break into the Python Debugger (pdb), you can use the `breakpoint()` function, which is built into Python starting from version 3.7. When the execution reaches this point, it will drop into the debugger.\n\nHere's how you can use it:\n\n```python\ndef my_function():\n    x = 10\n    breakpoint()  # This will start the debugger\n    y = x + 5\n    print(y)\n\nmy_function()\n```\n\nWhen you run this script, execution will pause at the `breakpoint()` line, and you'll be able to inspect variables, step through the code, and perform other debugging tasks using pdb commands.\n\nIf you're using a version of Python older than 3.7, you can achieve the same effect by explicitly importing pdb and calling `pdb.set_trace()`:\n\n```python\nimport pdb\n\ndef my_function():\n    x = 10\n    pdb.set_trace()  # This will start the debugger\n    y = x + 5\n    print(y)\n\nmy_function()\n```\n\nRemember, once you're in the debugger, you can use commands like `n` (next), `c` (continue), `q` (quit), and others to navigate and inspect your code execution."
