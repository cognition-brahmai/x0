        "content": "The `@=` symbol in Python is not reserved for decorators or any particular feature in the core Python language. Instead, it is a special operator used in the context of matrix multiplication and its augmented assignment in libraries like NumPy.\n\nIn Python, the `@` symbol is used for the matrix multiplication operator, as introduced in PEP 465. This means that if you have two matrices, `A` and `B`, you can perform matrix multiplication using `A @ B`.\n\nThe `@=` operator is the augmented assignment version of the matrix multiplication operator. It allows you to perform matrix multiplication and assignment in one step. For example, if `A` and `B` are matrices, the expression `A @= B` is equivalent to `A = A @ B`, meaning it multiplies `A` by `B` and assigns the result back to `A`.\n\nThis operator is particularly useful in numerical computing and data science workflows, where matrix operations are common. If you are encountering `@=` in a specific codebase, it is likely being used in this context for efficient matrix operations."
