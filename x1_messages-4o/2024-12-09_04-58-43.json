For example, I have a dictionary `D = {1:'a', 5:'b', 2:'a', 7:'a}` and I want to iterate through the keys in the order `1, 2, 5, 7`. Currently, I am iterating through the dictionary like this: \n```\nfor key in D:\n    # some code...\n```\nBut I want to go through the keys in a sorted order."

        "content": "To iterate through a Python dictionary by keys in a sorted order without using the `sort` or `sorted` functions, you can implement your own sorting algorithm. One simple way to do this is to use the selection sort algorithm, which is straightforward and easy to implement. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nD = {1: 'a', 5: 'b', 2: 'a', 7: 'a'}\n\n# Extract the keys into a list\nkeys = list(D.keys())\n\n# Implementing selection sort to sort the keys\nfor i in range(len(keys)):\n    # Find the minimum element in the remaining unsorted array\n    min_index = i\n    for j in range(i + 1, len(keys)):\n        if keys[j] < keys[min_index]:\n            min_index = j\n    # Swap the found minimum element with the first element\n    keys[i], keys[min_index] = keys[min_index], keys[i]\n\n# Iterate over the keys in the sorted order\nfor key in keys:\n    print(f\"Key: {key}, Value: {D[key]}\")\n\n# Output:\n# Key: 1, Value: a\n# Key: 2, Value: a\n# Key: 5, Value: b\n# Key: 7, Value: a\n```\n\nThis code snippet manually sorts the keys using the selection sort algorithm and then iterates over the sorted keys. Selection sort has a time complexity of \\(O(n^2)\\), which is not the most efficient for large datasets, but it serves the purpose for educational purposes or small datasets where you want to avoid built-in sorting functions."
