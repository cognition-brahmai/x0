How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the way environment variables like `$PWD` are handled in the Windows command prompt. In Unix-based systems, `$PWD` is used to represent the current working directory. However, in the Windows command prompt, environment variables are accessed using `%` signs, such as `%cd%` for the current directory.\n\nTo run your Docker command in the Windows console, you need to adjust the syntax to be compatible with Windows. Here's how you can modify your command:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -it --rm --name my-running-script -v \"%cd%\":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp python:2 python test.py\n```\n\nIn this command, `%cd%` is used instead of `$PWD` to get the current directory path.\n\nAdditionally, ensure the following when running this command on Windows:\n\n1. **Docker Desktop**: Make sure Docker Desktop is installed and running on your Windows machine.\n\n2. **Shared Drives**: Ensure that the drive containing your project files is shared with Docker. You can configure this in Docker Desktop settings under the \"Resources\" section by selecting \"File Sharing.\"\n\n3. **Path Validation**: Verify that the path to your Python script (test.py) is correct relative to your current directory.\n\nBy making these adjustments, your Docker command should work as expected in the Windows command prompt."
