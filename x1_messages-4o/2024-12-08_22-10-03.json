However, there are only a few blue marbles in the jar and many other colors. To increase your chances of winning, you are allowed to remove some marbles from the jar before drawing.\nUsing only the information given, what is the minimum number of marbles you must remove from the jar to guarantee a blue marble? And what is the maximum number of marbles you can remove while still having a chance to win? \nHint: You may want to think about how the probability of drawing a blue marble changes as you remove marbles from the jar."

        "content": "To guarantee that you draw a blue marble, you must remove all the marbles that are not blue. This means you need to remove every marble of a different color, leaving only the blue marbles in the jar. The minimum number of marbles you must remove to guarantee drawing a blue marble is the total number of marbles minus the number of blue marbles.\n\nFor the maximum number of marbles you can remove while still having a chance to win, you need to leave at least one blue marble in the jar. Therefore, the maximum number of marbles you can remove is the total number of marbles minus one. This ensures there is at least one marble left (which should be blue) to maintain a chance of winning."
