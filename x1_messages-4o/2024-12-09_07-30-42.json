        "content": "How can I call a grandparent method in Python inheritance? I have this code where I have three classes A, B and C where B is inherited from A and C is inherited from B. All three classes have a method named `foo`. The `foo` method in class `C` needs to call `foo` method from class `A` and store the result to `tmp`. I have tried using `super().foo()`, but it just calls the parent method `foo` from class `B`. How can I call the grandparent method `foo` from class `A`?\n\nHere is the code for reference:\n\n```python\nclass A:\n  def foo(self):\n    return \"A\"\n\nclass B(A):\n  def foo(self):\n    return \"B\"\n\nclass C(B):\n  def foo(self):\n    tmp = ... # call A's foo and store the result to tmp\n    return \"C\"+tmp\n```\n\nI am using Python 3."

        "content": "In Python, to call a method from a grandparent class directly, you can use the class name itself along with `self` to access the method. In your case, you can call the `foo` method from class `A` within class `C` by directly referencing `A.foo(self)`. Here's how you can modify your `foo` method in class `C` to achieve this:\n\n```python\nclass A:\n    def foo(self):\n        return \"A\"\n\nclass B(A):\n    def foo(self):\n        return \"B\"\n\nclass C(B):\n    def foo(self):\n        tmp = A.foo(self)  # Call A's foo and store the result to tmp\n        return \"C\" + tmp\n\n# Example usage:\nc_instance = C()\nprint(c_instance.foo())  # Output: \"CA\"\n```\n\nIn this modified code, `A.foo(self)` explicitly calls the `foo` method from class `A`, ensuring that you get the desired result from the grandparent class."
