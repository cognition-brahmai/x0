        "content": "To modify the given Scala code to generate 10 JSON-formatted records with specific conditions, you'll need to adjust the code logic accordingly. I will provide you with a Scala code snippet that achieves this, and I'll also guide you on how to add a random phone number using a shell command.\n\n### Scala Code Modification\n\nAssuming you have a basic Scala code that generates JSON records, you would modify it as follows:\n\n```scala\nimport scala.util.Random\nimport play.api.libs.json._\n\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int, phone: String)\n\nobject JsonGenerator extends App {\n\n  val namesStartingWithDOrM = Seq(\"David\", \"Daniel\", \"Diana\", \"Derek\", \"Daisy\", \"Mike\", \"Molly\", \"Mark\", \"Megan\", \"Mason\")\n\n  def generateRandomPhoneNumber(): String = {\n    val areaCode = Random.nextInt(900) + 100\n    val prefix = Random.nextInt(900) + 100\n    val lineNumber = Random.nextInt(10000) + 1000\n    s\"$areaCode-$prefix-$lineNumber\"\n  }\n\n  def generatePerson(): Person = {\n    val name = namesStartingWithDOrM(Random.nextInt(namesStartingWithDOrM.length))\n    val age = Random.nextInt(51) + 20 // age between 20 and 70\n    val phone = generateRandomPhoneNumber()\n    Person(name, age, phone)\n  }\n\n  val people = (1 to 10).map(_ => generatePerson())\n\n  val jsonRecords = Json.toJson(people)\n\n  println(Json.prettyPrint(jsonRecords))\n}\n\nimplicit val personWrites = new Writes[Person] {\n  def writes(person: Person) = Json.obj(\n    \"name\" -> person.name,\n    \"age\" -> person.age,\n    \"phone\" -> person.phone\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Name Selection**: The code uses a list of names that start with 'D' or 'M'.\n2. **Age Generation**: It generates ages between 20 and 70 using `Random.nextInt(51) + 20`.\n3. **Phone Number**: A random phone number is generated using a simple pattern of three parts.\n4. **Record Count**: The loop `(1 to 10)` ensures that 10 records are generated.\n\n### Adding a Random Phone Number Using a Shell Command\n\nIf you want to append a random phone number using a shell command, you could use a combination of shell tools like `awk` and `sed`. However, it's more straightforward to handle this within Scala as shown above. Nevertheless, here is how you could potentially use shell commands for modifications:\n\n```bash\n# Assuming you have a JSON file named 'records.json'\ncat records.json | jq '.[] |= . + {\"phone\": (1000000000 + (rand()*9000000000 | floor) | tostring)}' > updated_records.json\n```\n\n- **jq**: This command line JSON processor is used to manipulate JSON data.\n- **rand()**: Generates a random number, which is then formatted as a phone number.\n\nThis command will read from `records.json`, add a random phone number to each record, and output the result to `updated_records.json`. Note that `jq` must be installed on your system for this to work. However, the Scala method is generally more robust and flexible for generating structured data."
