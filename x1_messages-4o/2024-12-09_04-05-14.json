I've been trying to achieve this with the following list: `myList = [1, 8, 9, 2, 4, 9, 6, 7, 9, 8]`. I would like the output to be `sets = [(8, 9), (4, 9), (7, 9)]`. However, when I try to use the following code: `sets = [list(zip(myList[i:i], myList[-1:])) for i in myList if i==9]`, I get an empty array `[[], [], []]`. How can I correct this?"

        "content": "To create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the number 9 and the number preceding it in the list, you can use a simple list comprehension with enumeration to keep track of the indices. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nmyList = [1, 8, 9, 2, 4, 9, 6, 7, 9, 8]\n\n# Using list comprehension to create the desired list of tuples\nsets = [(myList[i-1], myList[i]) for i in range(1, len(myList)) if myList[i] == 9]\n\nprint(sets)\n```\n\nThis code iterates over `myList` starting from the second element (index 1) to the end. For each element, it checks if the current element is 9. If it is, it creates a tuple with the previous element and the current 9, and adds it to the `sets` list. This will give you the desired output:\n\n```\n[(8, 9), (4, 9), (7, 9)]\n```\n\nThe issue with your original code is that `zip(myList[i:i], myList[-1:])` is incorrect in terms of indexing and slicing, and it's not capturing the preceding element correctly. The corrected approach above addresses this by directly accessing elements using indices."
