The Rocky Mountains consist of mostly sedimentary rocks, while the Sierra Nevada has a mix of igneous and metamorphic rocks. The Appalachian Mountains are composed of mostly metamorphic rocks. Taking these factors into account, which mountain range is the oldest and what is its age in millions of years?"

        "content": "The Appalachian Mountains are the oldest among the three mountain ranges mentioned. They are primarily composed of metamorphic rocks, which is indicative of their long and complex geological history. The Appalachians were formed over 480 million years ago during the Ordovician Period, as part of the ancient mountain-building event known as the Taconic orogeny. Over hundreds of millions of years, they have been subject to extensive erosion, which has significantly reduced their height compared to younger ranges like the Rockies and the Sierra Nevada."
