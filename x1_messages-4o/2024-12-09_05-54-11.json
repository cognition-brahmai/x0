        "content": "The issue you're encountering is because Alpine Linux uses `ash` (the Almquist shell) by default, which is a lightweight shell, instead of `bash`. The OpenJDK Alpine image you are using does not include bash by default. To resolve this, you'll need to install bash in your Docker image. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Modify your Dockerfile to install bash:**\n\n   You can modify your Dockerfile to include bash by adding a `RUN` command to install it using `apk`, which is the package manager for Alpine Linux.\n\n   Here's an example of how you can modify your Dockerfile:\n\n   ```dockerfile\n   FROM openjdk:8-jdk-alpine\n\n   # Install bash\n   RUN apk add --no-cache bash\n\n   # Add your application's JAR file\n   ADD your-application.jar /app/your-application.jar\n\n   # Set the working directory\n   WORKDIR /app\n\n   # Run your application\n   CMD [\"java\", \"-jar\", \"your-application.jar\"]\n   ```\n\n2. **Rebuild your Docker image:**\n\n   After modifying your Dockerfile, you need to rebuild your Docker image:\n\n   ```bash\n   docker build -t your-image-name .\n   ```\n\n3. **Run your Docker container:**\n\n   Now you can run your Docker container, and bash should be available:\n\n   ```bash\n   docker run -it your-image-name /bin/bash\n   ```\n\n4. **For executing `./gradlew build`:**\n\n   If you are encountering issues with `./gradlew build`, it's likely because the Gradle wrapper script (`gradlew`) is using bash. After installing bash, you should be able to execute the script without issues.\n\n   If you still encounter problems, ensure that the `gradlew` script has executable permissions. You can set this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   chmod +x gradlew\n   ```\n\n   You might also need to adjust the Dockerfile to include any other dependencies that your build requires, such as `curl` or `git`, by adding similar `apk add` commands for those packages.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to use bash and execute `./gradlew build` in your Alpine-based Docker image."
