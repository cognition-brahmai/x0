Each person object has an attribute called 'birthdate' which is a datetime object. I want to order the list by birthdate, oldest first. What is the most Pythonic way to achieve this?"

        "content": "To sort a list of objects in Python by a specific attribute, you can use the `sorted()` function or the `sort()` method with a custom key. Since you want to sort the list by the `birthdate` attribute of the `person` objects, and you want the oldest first, you can do this by specifying the `birthdate` attribute in the key. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\nAssuming your list is named `results` and each object in the list is structured as described, you can sort it like this:\n\n```python\n# Using sorted() function to create a new sorted list\nsorted_results = sorted(results, key=lambda result: result.person.birthdate)\n\n# Or, if you want to sort the list in place using the sort() method\n# results.sort(key=lambda result: result.person.birthdate)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `sorted()` returns a new list that is sorted, leaving the original list `results` unchanged.\n- `sort()` modifies the original list in place.\n\nThe `key` argument takes a function that extracts the comparison key from each element in the list. Here, `lambda result: result.person.birthdate` is a lambda function that extracts the `birthdate` attribute from the `person` object contained in each `result`.\n\nBy default, `sorted()` and `sort()` order values in ascending order, which works perfectly since you want the oldest dates (earlier dates) first."
