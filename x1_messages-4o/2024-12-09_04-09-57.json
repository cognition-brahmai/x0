        "content": "To extract the specific content using BeautifulSoup, you can navigate the HTML structure and extract the text from the desired tags. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Extract \"Hello world\" from the table:**\n\nThe issue with your current method is that `soup.find(text='Name: ')` returns a NavigableString, and you need to navigate to its parent or sibling to get the text you're interested in. Here's a way to do it:\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\nhtml_content = \"\"\"\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"800\">\n  <tr>\n    <td colspan=\"2\"><b>Name: </b>Hello world</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <!-- other rows -->\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\"\"\"\n\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')\n\n# Find the <b> tag with text \"Name: \"\nname_b_tag = soup.find('b', text='Name: ')\n\n# The content \"Hello world\" is in the next sibling\nhello_world = name_b_tag.next_sibling.strip()\n\nprint(hello_world)  # Output: Hello world\n```\n\n2. **Extract \"My home address\" from the `<td>` tag:**\n\nTo extract the address, you can find the `<b>` tag with text \"Address:\" and then navigate to the next sibling `<td>` tag to get its text:\n\n```python\nhtml_content = \"\"\"\n<td><b>Address:</b></td>\n<td>My home address</td>\n\"\"\"\n\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')\n\n# Find the <b> tag with text \"Address:\"\naddress_b_tag = soup.find('b', text='Address:')\n\n# The content \"My home address\" is in the next sibling <td>\nmy_home_address = address_b_tag.find_parent('td').find_next_sibling('td').text.strip()\n\nprint(my_home_address)  # Output: My home address\n```\n\nThese snippets navigate the HTML structure to find the text nodes you are interested in. Note that `strip()` is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the extracted text."
