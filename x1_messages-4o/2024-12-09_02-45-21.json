However, I'm running into an error \"ValueError: multiclass format is not supported\". Can anyone guide me on how to solve this problem?\n\n```python\nclf_SVM = LinearSVC()\nparams = {\n          'C': [0.5, 1.0, 1.5],\n          'tol': [1e-3, 1e-4, 1e-5],\n          'multi_class': ['ovr', 'crammer_singer'],\n          }\ngs = GridSearchCV(clf_SVM, params, cv=5, scoring='roc_auc')\ngs.fit(corpus1, y)\n```\nThe shapes of corpus1 and y are (1726, 7001) and (1726,) respectively. The y variable includes four classes denoted by values from 0 to 3, both inclusive.\n\nHere is the error message:\n\n```python\nValueError: multiclass format is not supported\n```"

        "content": "The error \"ValueError: multiclass format is not supported\" is likely due to the use of the 'roc_auc' scoring metric, which is typically used for binary classification problems. For multiclass classification problems, you need to use a different scoring metric that supports multiclass data.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can use one of the following scoring metrics that are suitable for multiclass classification:\n\n1. `accuracy`: Measures the accuracy of the predictions.\n2. `f1_weighted`: Computes the F1 score, weighted by support (the number of true instances for each label).\n3. `precision_weighted`: Computes the precision score, weighted by support.\n4. `recall_weighted`: Computes the recall score, weighted by support.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use the `accuracy` metric:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.svm import LinearSVC\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.metrics import make_scorer, accuracy_score\n\nclf_SVM = LinearSVC()\nparams = {\n    'C': [0.5, 1.0, 1.5],\n    'tol': [1e-3, 1e-4, 1e-5],\n    'multi_class': ['ovr', 'crammer_singer'],\n}\ngs = GridSearchCV(clf_SVM, params, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')\ngs.fit(corpus1, y)\n\nprint(\"Best parameters found: \", gs.best_params_)\nprint(\"Best cross-validation accuracy: \", gs.best_score_)\n```\n\nThis code uses the `accuracy` metric, but you can replace it with any other appropriate metric based on your specific needs. Additionally, ensure that your data is properly preprocessed and that your labels are encoded correctly for the classification task."
