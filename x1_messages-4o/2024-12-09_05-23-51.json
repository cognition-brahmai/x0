However, when I try to use `x.max(dim=(1,2))`, it results in an error. How can I properly perform this operation?"

        "content": "In PyTorch, when you want to perform a `max()` operation over multiple dimensions, you need to do it sequentially because the `max()` function does not directly support specifying multiple dimensions at once. Instead, you can first perform the max operation on one dimension and then on the next. Here\u2019s how you can achieve your desired result:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\nx = torch.tensor([\n    [[-0.3000, -0.2926],[-0.2705, -0.2632]],\n    [[-0.1821, -0.1747],[-0.1526, -0.1453]],\n    [[-0.0642, -0.0568],[-0.0347, -0.0274]]\n])\n\n# First, take the max over the last dimension (dim=2)\nmax_dim2 = x.max(dim=2).values\n\n# Then, take the max over the second-to-last dimension (dim=1) on the result\nresult = max_dim2.max(dim=1).values\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code first reduces the tensor along the last dimension (i.e., dimension 2) and then reduces the resulting tensor along the second-to-last dimension (i.e., dimension 1). The `values` attribute is used to get the maximum values from the result of the `max()` operation. The final output will be:\n\n```\ntensor([-0.2632, -0.1453, -0.0274])\n```\n\nThis approach effectively computes the maximum over the specified dimensions, achieving the desired output."
