Starting from the first date (index 0), the mean stored in row x should be the average of values from index 0 to x. For example, my data looks like this:\n\n<pre><code>\ndata\nindex   value   mean          formula\n0       4\n1       5\n2       6\n3       7       5.5           average(0-3)\n4       4       5.2           average(0-4)\n5       5       5.166666667   average(0-5)\n6       6       5.285714286   average(0-6)\n7       7       5.5           average(0-7)\n</code></pre>\n\nI'm trying to find a solution without using loops to take advantage of pandas."

        "content": "To calculate an incremental mean of a time series in pandas without using explicit loops, you can make use of the `expanding()` method, which is particularly designed for such cumulative operations. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample data\ndata = {'value': [4, 5, 6, 7, 4, 5, 6, 7]}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Calculate the incremental mean\ndf['mean'] = df['value'].expanding().mean()\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`expanding()`**: The `expanding()` function in pandas is used to create an expanding window object. This is similar to rolling but starts at the first index and includes all data up to the current point.\n- **`mean()`**: After creating the expanding window, calling `mean()` on it will compute the mean from the first index up to the current one for each row.\n\nThis will give you an additional column in your DataFrame containing the incremental mean as desired. The `expanding()` method efficiently handles the operation without the need for explicit loops, leveraging pandas' optimized internals."
