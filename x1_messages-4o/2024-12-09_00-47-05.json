I'm trying to process all arguments except the first one. However, when I try to use \"echo \"${@:2}\" or \"echo \"${@:2,1}\", I receive a \"Bad substitution\" error from the terminal. I've looked for solutions online and found a wiki that suggests using \"echo \"${@: -1}\", but it doesn't solve my problem. How can I process all but the first argument passed to a bash script?"

        "content": "To process all arguments except the first one in a bash script, you can use the syntax `${@:2}`. This syntax is supported in bash, but if you're encountering a \"Bad substitution\" error, it's possible that your script is being run with a shell that doesn't support this syntax, such as `sh` or `dash`.\n\nHere's a simple example of how you can handle arguments in a bash script:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Check if at least one argument is provided\nif [ \"$#\" -lt 1 ]; then\n    echo \"Usage: $0 filename [other_args...]\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n# The first argument is the filename\nfilename=\"$1\"\necho \"Filename: $filename\"\n\n# Process all other arguments\nother_args=\"${@:2}\"\necho \"Other arguments: $other_args\"\n\n# You can now use $other_args as needed\n# For example, loop through them\nfor arg in \"${@:2}\"; do\n    echo \"Processing argument: $arg\"\ndone\n```\n\nMake sure that your script is executed with bash. You can explicitly run it using:\n\n```bash\nbash your_script.sh filename arg1 arg2 arg3\n```\n\nOr make sure the script has executable permissions and a correct shebang line (`#!/bin/bash`) at the top, then run it directly:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x your_script.sh\n./your_script.sh filename arg1 arg2 arg3\n```\n\nIf you're still experiencing issues, double-check the shebang line and ensure you're not accidentally running the script in a shell that doesn't support the `${@:2}` syntax."
