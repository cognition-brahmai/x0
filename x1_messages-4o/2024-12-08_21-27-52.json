It is made from volcanic rock and steel slag, making it environmentally friendly due to its recyclability.\n- **Fiberglass**: Widely used due to its affordability and ease of installation. However, its production is energy-intensive, and it is not biodegradable.\n- **Cellulose**: Made primarily from recycled newspaper, treated with fire-retardant chemicals. It is considered one of the most eco-friendly insulation options due to its recyclable nature and low embodied energy.\n\nThese materials are often chosen based on factors like budget, specific building requirements, and environmental considerations. For high-rise buildings, fire resistance is a critical factor, making Class A materials like these essential choices."
