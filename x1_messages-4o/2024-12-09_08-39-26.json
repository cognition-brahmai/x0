For instance, given the string 'abracadabra', the function should return {'a': 5, 'b': 2, 'c': 1, 'd': 1, 'r': 2}. I'm looking for a concise way to do this, ideally in a one-liner. I've tried using dictionary comprehensions and the reduce function, but I'm not satisfied with my solutions. How can I do this more efficiently and readably?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this in a concise and readable way using Python's `collections.Counter`, which is specifically designed for counting hashable objects in an iterable. Here's how you can do it in one line:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef compute_histogram(iterable):\n    return dict(Counter(iterable))\n\n# Example usage:\nresult = compute_histogram('abracadabra')\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThe `Counter` class from the `collections` module takes an iterable and returns a dictionary-like object where keys are the elements of the iterable and values are their counts. Converting this `Counter` object to a dictionary using `dict()` gives you the desired output.\n\nThis approach is both efficient and readable, fitting your requirements perfectly."
