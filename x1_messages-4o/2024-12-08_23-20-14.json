        "content": "Certainly! You can generate a random number between 1 and 100 that is not divisible by 5 by using the `random` module in Python and employing a loop to ensure the condition is met. Here's a sample code snippet to achieve that:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef generate_random_number():\n    while True:\n        number = random.randint(1, 100)\n        if number % 5 != 0:\n            return number\n\nrandom_number = generate_random_number()\nprint(\"Random number between 1 and 100 not divisible by 5:\", random_number)\n```\n\nThis code uses a `while` loop to keep generating a random number until it finds one that is not divisible by 5. Once such a number is found, it returns and prints the number."
