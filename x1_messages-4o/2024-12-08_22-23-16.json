Here's a breakdown of what each part of the command does:\n\n1. `SELECT first_name, last_name, SUM(sales)`: This line specifies the columns you want to retrieve from the `employees` table. It selects the `first_name` and `last_name` of each employee, as well as the sum of their sales.\n\n2. `FROM employees`: This line indicates that the data is being selected from the `employees` table.\n\n3. `GROUP BY first_name, last_name`: This line groups the results by the `first_name` and `last_name` of the employees. This means that the `SUM(sales)` will be calculated for each unique combination of `first_name` and `last_name`.\n\n4. `ORDER BY 3 DESC`: This line sorts the results based on the third column in the `SELECT` statement, which is `SUM(sales)`, in descending order. This means the employee with the highest total sales will appear first in the results.\n\nWhen you execute this SQL command, the database will return a list of employees with their names and their total sales, sorted from the highest to the lowest total sales."
