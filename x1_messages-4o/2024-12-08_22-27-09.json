        "content": "To tackle this comprehensive task using Ruby, we need a multi-step approach that involves data gathering, processing, and analysis. Here's how you can structure your Ruby code to achieve this:\n\n### Step 1: Data Gathering\n\nWe'll start by collecting data from various sources. This may involve scraping websites, accessing APIs, or reading data from files. For simplicity, let's assume you have access to APIs that provide JSON data for student financial aid information, textbook pricing, and academic performance.\n\n#### Example Ruby Code for Data Gathering\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'net/http'\nrequire 'json'\n\n# Function to fetch data from an API\ndef fetch_data_from_api(url)\n  uri = URI(url)\n  response = Net::HTTP.get(uri)\n  JSON.parse(response)\nend\n\n# URLs for APIs (example placeholders)\nfinancial_aid_url = 'https://api.example.com/financial_aid'\ntextbook_pricing_url = 'https://api.example.com/textbook_pricing'\nacademic_performance_url = 'https://api.example.com/academic_performance'\n\n# Fetching data\nfinancial_aid_data = fetch_data_from_api(financial_aid_url)\ntextbook_pricing_data = fetch_data_from_api(textbook_pricing_url)\nacademic_performance_data = fetch_data_from_api(academic_performance_url)\n```\n\n### Step 2: Data Processing\n\nOnce we have the data, we need to process it to understand the financial hardship and its impact on academic progress and career prospects. This involves merging data from different sources and performing calculations or statistical analysis.\n\n#### Example Ruby Code for Data Processing\n\n```ruby\n# Function to calculate hardship index based on financial aid and textbook pricing\ndef calculate_hardship_index(financial_aid, textbook_cost)\n  # Example calculation: (textbook cost - financial aid) / textbook cost\n  hardship_index = (textbook_cost - financial_aid) / textbook_cost.to_f\n  hardship_index.clamp(0, 1) # Ensure the index is between 0 and 1\nend\n\n# Combine data and calculate hardship index\nstudents_data = financial_aid_data.map do |student|\n  textbook_cost = textbook_pricing_data.find { |book| book['student_id'] == student['id'] }['price']\n  hardship_index = calculate_hardship_index(student['aid_amount'], textbook_cost)\n  \n  {\n    student_id: student['id'],\n    hardship_index: hardship_index,\n    academic_performance: academic_performance_data.find { |record| record['student_id'] == student['id'] }['performance']\n  }\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Data Analysis\n\nAnalyze the processed data to understand the impact and generate insights. This could involve statistical analysis to find correlations between hardship index and academic performance.\n\n#### Example Ruby Code for Data Analysis\n\n```ruby\n# Analyze the impact of hardship on academic performance\ndef analyze_impact(students_data)\n  total_students = students_data.size\n  struggling_students = students_data.count { |data| data[:hardship_index] > 0.5 && data[:academic_performance] < 'C' }\n  \n  impact_percentage = (struggling_students.to_f / total_students) * 100\n  puts \"Percentage of students struggling due to financial hardship: #{impact_percentage.round(2)}%\"\nend\n\n# Run analysis\nanalyze_impact(students_data)\n```\n\n### Step 4: Inform Policy Decisions\n\nTo advocate for policy changes, summarize your findings and highlight the benefits of providing free or subsidized textbooks. Use the insights to create reports or presentations for stakeholders.\n\n#### Example Advocacy Points\n\n- **Correlation between Hardship and Performance:** Demonstrate how financial hardship negatively impacts academic performance.\n- **Benefits of Free Textbooks:** Show potential improvements in academic outcomes when financial barriers are removed.\n- **Long-Term Economic Benefits:** Argue that investing in free educational materials can lead to a more educated workforce, benefiting society and the economy.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis example provides a foundational approach to using Ruby for data-driven advocacy in educational policy. You can expand upon this by integrating more sophisticated data analysis techniques, machine learning models, or visualizations to enhance your findings and recommendations."
