        "content": "Your current approach is already quite efficient and straightforward for filtering out non-NaN values from a NumPy array. However, there are a couple of alternatives that might be considered slightly more Pythonic or concise:\n\n1. **Using Boolean Indexing Directly**: You don't necessarily need to use `np.invert`; you can directly use the boolean array returned by `np.isnan(a)` to index your array. This approach avoids explicitly inverting the boolean array:\n\n    ```python\n    import numpy as np\n\n    a = np.array([np.nan, 1, 2])\n    non_nan_values = a[~np.isnan(a)]\n    print(non_nan_values)\n    # Output: array([1., 2.])\n    ```\n\n    Here, `~np.isnan(a)` directly negates the boolean array, which is a common idiom in Python for inverting boolean arrays.\n\n2. **Using `np.compress`**: Another approach is to use `np.compress`, which is a bit more explicit about filtering:\n\n    ```python\n    import numpy as np\n\n    a = np.array([np.nan, 1, 2])\n    non_nan_values = np.compress(~np.isnan(a), a)\n    print(non_nan_values)\n    # Output: array([1., 2.])\n    ```\n\nBoth methods are clear and effective for filtering out NaN values. The first method is generally preferred for its readability and conciseness, especially in NumPy-centric code."
