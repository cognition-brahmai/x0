I've considered the 'os.system' method, but I'm not sure how to use it to send two actions, the 'cd' and then the '>'."

This will truncate the file to zero length, effectively emptying it. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Open the file in write mode, which will truncate the file to zero length\nwith open('thefile.ext', 'w'):\n    pass\n```\n\nThis code opens the file `'thefile.ext'` in write mode. When opened in this way, any existing content in the file is erased, and the file is truncated to zero length. The `pass` statement is used here because we don't need to perform any operations on the file itself; we just need to open it in the correct mode to empty it.\n\nThis method is straightforward and doesn't require changing directories or executing shell commands, making it portable and less prone to errors."
