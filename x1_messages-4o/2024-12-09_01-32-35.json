For example, when I execute <code>print('abc' &lt; 'bac')</code>, it returns <code>True</code>. I understand that this is because it compares corresponding characters in the string, however it's unclear why the comparison gives more weight to the fact that <code>a</code> is less than <code>b</code> (in first position) in the first string rather than the fact that <code>a</code> is less than <code>b</code> in the second string (in second position). Could you please explain this?"

        "content": "In Python, string comparison is performed lexicographically, which is similar to how words are ordered in a dictionary. When you use comparison operators like `<` or `>`, Python compares the strings character by character from left to right.\n\nHere's how the comparison works:\n\n1. **Character-by-Character Comparison**: Python starts comparing the first character of each string. If one character is less than the other, the comparison is determined at that point. If the characters are equal, Python moves to the next character in both strings.\n\n2. **ASCII/Unicode Values**: The comparison is based on the Unicode (or ASCII for basic characters) values of the characters. For example, `'a'` has a Unicode value of 97, and `'b'` has a Unicode value of 98, so `'a' < 'b'` is `True`.\n\n3. **Stopping Condition**: The comparison stops as soon as a difference is found. If all characters in the compared parts are equal, the strings are considered equal if they are of the same length. If they differ in length after all comparable characters are found equal, the shorter string is considered smaller.\n\nIn your example, `'abc' < 'bac'`:\n\n- The first characters `a` and `b` are compared. Since `'a'` (97) is less than `'b'` (98), the whole string `'abc'` is considered less than `'bac'`, and the comparison stops there. The positions of subsequent characters (`'b'` and `'a'`) are not even checked because the decision is already made based on the first character.\n\nThis lexicographical order is consistent with how strings are sorted and compared in many programming languages."
