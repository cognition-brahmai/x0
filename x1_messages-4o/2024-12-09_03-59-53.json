        "content": "In Python, `print` is indeed a function, but the way you're trying to use it in your example is causing the syntax error. Starting from Python 3, `print` is a built-in function rather than a statement, which it was in Python 2.\n\nIn Python 3, you need to use parentheses to call `print`, even if you just want to see what `print` itself is. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n>>> print(print)\n<built-in function print>\n```\n\nThe syntax error you're encountering happens because you're trying to use `print` without parentheses, which is not allowed in Python 3. In Python 2, `print` was a statement and didn't require parentheses, but since Python 3, it's necessary to use them to call it as a function."
