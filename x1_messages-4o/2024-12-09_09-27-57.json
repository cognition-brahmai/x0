        "content": "Parsing a web page using a Perl script can be done using various modules available in Perl, such as `LWP::UserAgent` for fetching web pages and `HTML::TreeBuilder` or `HTML::Parser` for parsing HTML content. Here is a basic example of how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Install Necessary Modules**: Ensure you have the necessary modules installed. You can install them using CPAN if they are not already available.\n\n   ```bash\n   cpan install LWP::UserAgent\n   cpan install HTML::TreeBuilder\n   ```\n\n2. **Write the Perl Script**: Below is a sample Perl script to fetch and parse a web page.\n\n   ```perl\n   use strict;\n   use warnings;\n   use LWP::UserAgent;\n   use HTML::TreeBuilder;\n\n   # Create a user agent object\n   my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;\n\n   # Define the URL to be fetched\n   my $url = 'http://example.com';\n\n   # Make the HTTP request\n   my $response = $ua->get($url);\n\n   # Check if the request was successful\n   if ($response->is_success) {\n       # Get the content of the page\n       my $content = $response->decoded_content;\n\n       # Create a tree structure of the HTML content\n       my $tree = HTML::TreeBuilder->new;\n       $tree->parse($content);\n       $tree->eof;\n\n       # Example: Extract all links from the page\n       my @links = $tree->look_down('_tag', 'a');\n       foreach my $link (@links) {\n           my $url = $link->attr('href');\n           my $text = $link->as_text;\n           print \"Link: $url Text: $text\\n\";\n       }\n\n       # Delete the tree when done\n       $tree->delete;\n   } else {\n       die $response->status_line;\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Run the Script**: Save the script as `parse_web.pl` and run it using Perl.\n\n   ```bash\n   perl parse_web.pl\n   ```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **LWP::UserAgent**: This module allows you to make HTTP requests. It is used here to fetch the content of the web page.\n\n- **HTML::TreeBuilder**: This module is used to parse the HTML content and build a tree structure. It provides methods to traverse and extract data from the HTML document.\n\n- **look_down**: This method is used to find all `<a>` tags in the HTML document, which typically represent hyperlinks.\n\nThis script provides a basic framework for web scraping. Depending on the structure of the web page and the data you're interested in, you might need to modify the script to suit your specific needs."
