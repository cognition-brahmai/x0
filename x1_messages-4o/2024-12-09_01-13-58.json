After generating these figures, they get immediately saved to disk and therefore, I need to clear them from memory. Currently, at the end of each function, I run `plt.clf()` to clear the figure, as shown in the code below:\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.clf()\n```\nHowever, I am unsure if this is sufficient to completely clear the memory. I am particularly concerned since I've noticed that each time I run my module for debugging, my available memory space keeps decreasing. What additional steps should I take to ensure that the memory is fully cleared each time after I have saved the plots to disk?"

        "content": "When working with `matplotlib` and generating multiple figures, it's important to ensure that memory is properly managed to avoid memory leaks. The function `plt.clf()` clears the current figure but does not close it, which means that the figure and its associated resources might still occupy memory.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to ensure that memory is fully cleared:\n\n1. **Close the Figure:** After saving the figure, use `plt.close()` to close it. This will free up the memory used by the figure.\n\n    ```python\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n    # Create and save your figure\n    plt.plot(range(10))\n    plt.savefig('figure.png')\n\n    # Clear the figure\n    plt.clf()\n\n    # Close the figure\n    plt.close()\n    ```\n\n2. **Use `plt.close(fig)` with Figure Object:** If you create figures using `plt.figure()`, you can close them specifically by passing the figure object to `plt.close()`.\n\n    ```python\n    fig = plt.figure()\n    plt.plot(range(10))\n    plt.savefig('figure.png')\n\n    # Clear and close the specific figure\n    fig.clf()\n    plt.close(fig)\n    ```\n\n3. **Use `gc.collect()`:** If you still experience memory issues, consider using Python's garbage collection module to explicitly free up memory.\n\n    ```python\n    import gc\n\n    # After closing figures\n    gc.collect()\n    ```\n\n4. **Check for Unused Variables:** Ensure that there are no references to the figure objects elsewhere in your code. Sometimes, keeping a reference to a figure object can prevent it from being garbage collected.\n\n5. **Monitor Memory Usage:** Use tools such as memory profilers to monitor memory usage and identify potential leaks or inefficient memory usage in your code.\n\nBy implementing these steps, you should be able to manage memory more effectively and avoid running into issues with decreasing available memory space during repeated executions of your data analysis module."
