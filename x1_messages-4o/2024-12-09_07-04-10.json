Here's a simple script to achieve that:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Get the current directory\ncurrent_directory = os.getcwd()\n\n# List all entries in the current directory\nentries = os.listdir(current_directory)\n\n# Filter out entries that are directories\nsubdirectories = [entry for entry in entries if os.path.isdir(os.path.join(current_directory, entry))]\n\nprint(\"Subdirectories:\", subdirectories)\n```\n\nThis code snippet will print out a list of all the subdirectories in the current working directory. Here's a breakdown of what it does:\n\n1. `os.getcwd()` retrieves the current working directory.\n2. `os.listdir(current_directory)` lists all entries (files and directories) in the current directory.\n3. The list comprehension filters out entries that are directories using `os.path.isdir()`.\n4. Finally, it prints the list of subdirectories."
