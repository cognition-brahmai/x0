For example, I have an array with the shape of [9,2] like:\n\n```python\n[[ 0  1]\n [ 2  3]\n [ 4  5]\n [ 6  7]\n [ 8  9]\n [10 11]\n [12 13]\n [14 15]\n [16 17]]\n```\n\nI would like to transform this array so that each column becomes a shape [3,3] as follows:\n\n```python\n[[ 0  6 12]\n [ 2  8 14]\n [ 4 10 16]]\n[[ 1  7 13]\n [ 3  9 15]\n [ 5 11 17]]\n```\n\nThe most obvious solution is to initialize an array of zeros with the proper dimension and run two for-loops where it will be filled with data. However, I'm interested in a solution that is more compliant with Python language constructs."

        "content": "You can achieve this reshaping using NumPy's powerful array manipulation capabilities without needing to initialize an array of zeros and manually fill it with data using loops. Instead, you can use the `reshape` and `transpose` methods to get the desired result. Here's a concise way to do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original array\narray = np.array([\n    [ 0,  1],\n    [ 2,  3],\n    [ 4,  5],\n    [ 6,  7],\n    [ 8,  9],\n    [10, 11],\n    [12, 13],\n    [14, 15],\n    [16, 17]\n])\n\n# Reshape the array\nreshaped_array = array.reshape(3, 3, 2)\n\n# Transpose the axes to get the desired shape\nresult = reshaped_array.transpose(2, 0, 1)\n\n# Print the results\nfor subarray in result:\n    print(subarray)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Reshape**: First, reshape the original array from shape `(9, 2)` to `(3, 3, 2)`. This effectively separates the first and second columns into the third dimension.\n\n2. **Transpose**: Use `transpose(2, 0, 1)` to rearrange the axes so that the shape becomes `(2, 3, 3)`. This rearranges the data by putting the original second column into a separate matrix.\n\nNow, you have two arrays with the desired shape `[3, 3]`. Each of these arrays represents one of the original columns in the new format."
