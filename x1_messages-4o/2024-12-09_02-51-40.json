For instance, given a list 'a' that only contains ones and zeros like this:\n\n```python\na = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\n\nI have used a for loop to get the indices of the non-zero elements and append them to another list 'b':\n\n```python\nb = []\nfor i in range(len(a)):\n    if a[i] == 1:  \n        b.append(i)\nprint(b)\n```\nHowever, I am looking for a more 'pythonic' way to achieve this. Could you suggest a more efficient or cleaner method?"

        "content": "Certainly! A more \"pythonic\" way to obtain the indices of non-zero elements in a list is by using list comprehensions, which are concise and efficient. Here\u2019s how you can achieve the same result using a list comprehension:\n\n```python\na = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nb = [i for i, value in enumerate(a) if value == 1]\nprint(b)\n```\n\nIn this example, `enumerate(a)` generates pairs of index and value `(i, value)` as you iterate over the list `a`. The list comprehension then selects the indices `i` where the `value` is 1, effectively creating a list `b` that contains the indices of non-zero elements. This method is both clean and efficient."
