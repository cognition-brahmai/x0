However, I am new to Python and I'm not sure why it's not working with back references properly."

        "content": "The issue you are encountering is due to the incorrect usage of backreferences in the `re.sub` function. In Python, backreferences use `\\\\` instead of `\\` to denote group references in replacement patterns. \n\nIn your code, `\"\\1\"` is interpreted as a regular string with the character `1`, rather than a backreference to the first captured group. To correctly reference the captured group, you need to use `\"\\\\1\"`.\n\nHere's how you can fix your code:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nfileText = '<text top=\"52\" left=\"20\" width=\"383\" height=\"15\" font=\"0\"><b>test</b></text>'\nfileText = re.sub(r\"<b>(.*?)</b>\", r\"\\1\", fileText, flags=re.DOTALL)\n\nprint(fileText)\n```\n\nBy using `r\"\\1\"`, you specify a raw string where `\\1` is correctly interpreted as a backreference to the first capturing group `(.*?)`, which contains the text inside the `<b>` tags. Now, when you run the code, it should produce the expected output:\n\n```plaintext\n<text top=\"52\" left=\"20\" width=\"383\" height=\"15\" font=\"0\">test</text>\n```\n\nMake sure to use raw string literals (preceded by `r`) for both the pattern and replacement strings to avoid any potential escape sequence issues."
