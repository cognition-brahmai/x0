It then fills the remaining length with random selections from all available characters.\n- **Shuffling**: The characters in the passcode are shuffled to enhance randomness.\n- **Password Policy Guidelines**: The program includes comments and print statements to remind users to utilize a password manager and enable two-factor authentication as per the company's guidelines.\n\nFeel free to modify the passcode length or add additional functionality as needed!"
