Also, what would be the best format to save these images in? While I am familiar with png and eps, I am unable to use pdf due to some hidden numbers that interfere with Latexmk compilation."

        "content": "To ensure that the images you save in Python are of very high quality and can be zoomed into without encountering blurring, you can follow these tips:\n\n1. **Resolution and DPI**: When saving images, ensure that you set a high resolution and dots per inch (DPI). Matplotlib, for example, allows you to specify the DPI when saving an image, which can significantly improve the quality.\n\n    ```python\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n    plt.savefig('high_quality_image.png', dpi=300)\n    ```\n\n   A DPI of 300 is generally considered high quality for print.\n\n2. **Image Format**: PNG is a good choice for high-quality images as it is a lossless format, meaning it does not compress the image data, which preserves quality. However, if you require vector graphics where you can zoom infinitely without losing quality, EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) is a suitable choice as it is a vector format.\n\n3. **Vector Graphics**: If your images are primarily line art, charts, or plots, saving them as vector graphics is beneficial. While you mentioned issues with PDF, EPS is a good alternative for vector graphics. Ensure that your plotting library supports EPS.\n\n    ```python\n    plt.savefig('high_quality_image.eps', format='eps', dpi=300)\n    ```\n\n4. **Increasing Figure Size**: For plots and charts, increasing the figure size can also help maintain quality when zooming in. You can specify the figure size in inches, which, combined with a high DPI, results in larger images with more detail.\n\n    ```python\n    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\n    ```\n\n5. **Use of Libraries**: Libraries like PIL/Pillow or OpenCV provide additional functionality for manipulating and saving images. For example, ensuring that images are saved with the appropriate settings to preserve quality.\n\n    ```python\n    from PIL import Image\n\n    image = Image.open('input.png')\n    image.save('high_quality_image.png', dpi=(300, 300))\n    ```\n\nBy combining these techniques, you can ensure that the images you save are of high quality and suitable for zooming without losing detail. If EPS is not satisfactory due to compatibility issues, consider revisiting the use of PDF with different settings or exploring other vector formats or solutions to the specific Latexmk compilation issue."
