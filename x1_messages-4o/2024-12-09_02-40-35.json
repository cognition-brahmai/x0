Let's break it down:\n\n**CGI (Common Gateway Interface):**\n\n- **What it is:** CGI is a standard way for web servers to interface with executable programs running on a server that generate web pages dynamically.\n- **How it works:** When a web server receives a request for a CGI script, it runs the script as a separate process. This script can be written in various programming languages like Python, Perl, or even shell scripts.\n- **Output:** The script processes the input data (e.g., data from a form) and returns output, which the web server sends back to the client (usually a web browser).\n- **Drawbacks:** Every time a CGI script is requested, the server starts a new process. This can be inefficient and slow, especially for high-traffic sites, as creating and destroying processes for each request is resource-intensive.\n\n**WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface):**\n\n- **What it is:** WSGI is a specification for a universal interface between web servers and web applications or frameworks written in Python.\n- **How it works:** WSGI provides a standard way for web servers to communicate with web applications. It allows a web server to forward requests to a Python application and return the application's response to the client.\n- **Efficiency:** Unlike CGI, WSGI doesn\u2019t start a new process for each request. Instead, it can handle multiple requests using long-running processes, which is much more efficient and scalable.\n- **Why it's important:** WSGI is part of Python\u2019s standard library and has become the de facto standard for deploying Python web applications. It allows for greater flexibility and more efficient application deployment.\n\nIn essence, both CGI and WSGI serve as bridges between a web server and the application logic, but WSGI is more efficient and better suited for modern web applications, especially those written in Python."
