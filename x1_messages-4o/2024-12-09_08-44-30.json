My code is:\n\n```python\nreader = csv.reader(open(filepath, \"rU\"))\ntry:\n    for row in reader:\n        print 'Row read successfully!', row\nexcept csv.Error, e:\n    sys.exit('file %s, line %d: %s' % (filename, reader.line_num, e))\n```\n\nOne of the files is giving me this error: `file my.csv, line 1: line contains NULL byte`. From my research on Google, it seems like this error might be due to an Excel file being improperly saved as a .csv. How can I resolve this issue in Python? \n\nAdditionally, on following a suggestion, I added these lines to my script:\n\n```python\nprint repr(open(filepath, 'rb').read(200)) # dump 1st 200 bytes of file\ndata = open(filepath, 'rb').read()\nprint data.find('\\x00')\nprint data.count('\\x00')\n```\n\nThe output I got was:\n\n```\n'\\xd0\\xcf\\x11\\xe0\\xa1\\xb1\\x1a\\xe1\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\ .... &lt;snip&gt;\n8\n13834\n```\n\nThis confirms that the file indeed has NULL bytes."

        "content": "The presence of NULL bytes (`\\x00`) in your CSV file suggests that the file is not a plain text CSV file but is likely in a binary format, such as an Excel file saved with a `.csv` extension. Excel files, especially older `.xls` files, can have this kind of issue when improperly saved as CSV.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. **Open and Resave in Excel:**\n   - Open the `.csv` file in Excel or another spreadsheet program that supports the format.\n   - Resave the file explicitly as a CSV file. When saving, ensure that you choose the proper CSV format (e.g., CSV UTF-8).\n\n2. **Convert to CSV using a Python library:**\n   - If you have access to libraries like `pandas` or `openpyxl`, you can convert the file within your Python script. Here's how you can do it using `pandas`:\n\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n\n   # Load the Excel file\n   df = pd.read_excel(filepath, engine='openpyxl')  # Use 'openpyxl' for .xlsx files\n\n   # Save it as a CSV file\n   df.to_csv('converted.csv', index=False)\n\n   # Now, you can read the converted CSV file\n   with open('converted.csv', 'r') as csvfile:\n       reader = csv.reader(csvfile)\n       for row in reader:\n           print('Row read successfully!', row)\n   ```\n\n   Replace `engine='openpyxl'` with `engine='xlrd'` if you're dealing with older `.xls` files.\n\n3. **Handling NULL Bytes Programmatically:**\n   - If you must work with the file as is, you can preprocess the file to remove NULL bytes, though this approach may not preserve all data correctly if the file is not genuinely a CSV.\n\n   ```python\n   with open(filepath, 'rb') as file:\n       data = file.read().replace(b'\\x00', b'')  # Remove NULL bytes\n\n   with open('cleaned.csv', 'wb') as file:\n       file.write(data)\n\n   # Now read the cleaned file\n   with open('cleaned.csv', 'r') as csvfile:\n       reader = csv.reader(csvfile)\n       for row in reader:\n           print('Row read successfully!', row)\n   ```\n\nChoose the method that best suits your situation. The first two methods are more reliable if the file originated from Excel. The third method is a workaround and should be used with caution."
