        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to linking the CUDA libraries correctly. When you see errors about \"undefined reference,\" it typically indicates that the linker is unable to find the necessary libraries to resolve those function calls. Here's how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check CMakeLists.txt**: Ensure your `CMakeLists.txt` is correctly set up to find and link CUDA libraries. You should typically use the `find_package` command to locate CUDA, and link against the necessary CUDA libraries using `target_link_libraries`.\n\n   Here's an example of what your `CMakeLists.txt` might look like:\n\n   ```cmake\n   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)\n   project(MyCUDAProject)\n\n   find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)\n\n   add_executable(clu clu.cpp)\n\n   # Link against CUDA libraries\n   target_link_libraries(clu ${CUDA_LIBRARIES})\n\n   # If using CUDA Toolkit 11 or newer, you might need to explicitly specify\n   # the CUDA runtime library\n   target_link_libraries(clu ${CUDA_CUDART_LIBRARY})\n   ```\n\n2. **Specify Library Path**: If `libcuda.so` is located in a non-standard directory, you should specify its path for the linker. You can do this by setting the `CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH` or using `link_directories`.\n\n   ```cmake\n   link_directories(/usr/local/cuda/lib64/stubs)\n   ```\n\n3. **Ensure Correct CUDA Toolkit Version**: Make sure that the version of the CUDA toolkit you're using matches the one expected by your application. Sometimes, version mismatches can lead to these types of issues.\n\n4. **Environment Variables**: Ensure that your environment variables are set correctly. For instance:\n\n   ```bash\n   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n   ```\n\n5. **Use the Stubs Library**: Since you're specifically pointing out `/usr/local/cuda/lib64/stubs/libcuda.so`, ensure that your linker is using this stub library during the linking phase. The stub library is typically used when you're building an application that doesn't need to run on the same machine where it's built.\n\n6. **Verbose Output**: If you're still having trouble, consider enabling verbose output for CMake and Make to better understand what's happening:\n\n   ```bash\n   make VERBOSE=1\n   ```\n\n   This will print the exact commands being executed, which can help diagnose what's going wrong.\n\nBy ensuring all these settings are correct, you should be able to resolve the linker errors you're encountering."
