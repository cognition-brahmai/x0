        "content": "The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) is known for its extensive collection of words, including many that are obscure or unusual. Here are three such words, along with their definitions:\n\n1. **Floccinaucinihilipilification**:\n   - **Definition**: The action or habit of estimating something as worthless. This word is often cited as one of the longest non-technical words in the English language.\n\n2. **Quomodocunquize**:\n   - **Definition**: To make money in any way possible. This rare verb emphasizes the lengths to which someone might go to earn money, regardless of the method.\n\n3. **Sesquipedalian**:\n   - **Definition**: Characterized by long words; long-winded. It can also refer to a person who uses long, sometimes obscure, words in speech or writing.\n\nThese words are examples of the richness and diversity of the English language, capturing unusual concepts and characteristics."
