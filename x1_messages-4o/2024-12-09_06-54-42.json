For instance, I would like to run my Python script from the command line like this: \n\n```python\npython code.py input.txt\n```\n\nIn this case, \"input.txt\" is the name of the file that the Python script will analyze. What changes do I need to make in my Python code to achieve this?"

        "content": "To modify your Python script to accept a file name as a command line input, you can use the `sys` module, which provides access to command-line arguments. Here\u2019s a simple example of how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Import the `sys` module**: Use this module to access `sys.argv`, a list in Python, which contains the command-line arguments passed to the script.\n\n2. **Access the file name**: The first argument (i.e., `sys.argv[0]`) is the script name, and the second argument (i.e., `sys.argv[1]`) will be the file name you pass.\n\n3. **Add error handling**: It\u2019s a good idea to add some error handling to manage cases where the user does not provide the correct number of arguments.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how your Python script might look:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Check if a file name is provided\n    if len(sys.argv) != 2:\n        print(\"Usage: python code.py <inputfile>\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n    \n    # Get the file name from command line arguments\n    input_file = sys.argv[1]\n\n    try:\n        # Open and read the file\n        with open(input_file, 'r') as file:\n            content = file.read()\n            # Process the content of the file as needed\n            print(content)\n\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"Error: The file '{input_file}' was not found.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`sys.argv`**: This is a list of command-line arguments. `sys.argv[0]` is the script name, and `sys.argv[1]` is the first argument after the script name, which in this case should be the input file name.\n\n- **Error Handling**: The script checks if exactly one argument is provided (`len(sys.argv) != 2`) and provides usage instructions if not. It also handles the `FileNotFoundError` to inform the user if the specified file cannot be found.\n\n- **Reading the File**: If the file is found, it reads the contents and prints them, but you can replace `print(content)` with any file processing logic you need.\n\nBy following these steps, your script will be able to accept a file name as a command line argument and process it accordingly."
