Occasionally, hexadecimal messages arrive which require different processing. If I receive a message such as \"00480065006C006C006F00200077006F0072006C00640021\", I need to perform a check to determine if it is hexadecimal. I am using Python 2.6.5 and sometimes receive normal text messages, not just hexadecimal. The messages I send are received as hexadecimal, while those sent by the operator are received as normal strings. How can I ensure that I have the message in the correct string format? I am using a Huawei 3G modem and PyHumod to read data from the SIM card."

        "content": "To check if a string is hexadecimal in Python, you can create a simple function that tries to convert the string to bytes using hexadecimal decoding. If it succeeds, the string is hexadecimal. If it fails, it is not. Here's how you can do it in Python 2.6.5:\n\n```python\ndef is_hexadecimal(s):\n    try:\n        # Attempt to decode the string using hexadecimal\n        s.decode('hex')\n        return True\n    except TypeError:\n        # If an error occurs, the string is not hexadecimal\n        return False\n\n# Example usage\nmessage = \"00480065006C006C006F00200077006F0072006C00640021\"\nif is_hexadecimal(message):\n    print(\"The message is hexadecimal.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The message is not hexadecimal.\")\n```\n\nThis function uses the `decode('hex')` method available in Python 2 to check if the string can be decoded from hexadecimal format. If the decoding fails, a `TypeError` is raised, indicating that the string is not valid hexadecimal.\n\nAdditionally, if you want to process the message further once you know it's hexadecimal, you can convert it into a readable format using the same `decode('hex')` method like so:\n\n```python\nif is_hexadecimal(message):\n    decoded_message = message.decode('hex')\n    print(\"Decoded message:\", decoded_message)\n```\n\nThis will convert the hexadecimal message into a human-readable string, assuming it represents a valid encoding (e.g., UTF-8 or ASCII). Ensure you handle the decoded message appropriately based on your specific use case."
