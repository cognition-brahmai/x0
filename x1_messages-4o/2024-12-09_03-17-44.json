The error message I receive is:\n\n```\n/Users/luke/Desktop/trainHOG/trainhog ; exit;\ndyld: Library not loaded: lib/libopencv_core.3.0.dylib\n  Referenced from: /Users/luke/Desktop/trainHOG/trainhog\n  Reason: image not found\nTrace/BPT trap: 5\nlogout\n```\n\nThe library, 'libopencv_core.3.0.dylib', is certainly present in the respective folder. I have tried re-pasting it into the folder, reinstalling openCV and macports, and also tried setting the `export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH = \"path to dynamic libs here..\"` command. Despite these attempts, the problem persists. I have even resorted to rebooting my computer multiple times. Could you suggest any solutions to solve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that the dynamic linker (dyld) on your Mac is unable to find the OpenCV library `libopencv_core.3.0.dylib`, even though it is present in the specified location. Here are some steps you can try to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH**:\n   Make sure that `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` is set correctly. To check if the environment variable is correctly set, you can use the following command in the terminal:\n   ```bash\n   echo $DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH\n   ```\n   Ensure that the path includes the directory where `libopencv_core.3.0.dylib` is located.\n\n2. **Use install_name_tool**:\n   Sometimes, the binary might not be correctly referencing the library path. You can use `install_name_tool` to change the path in the binary:\n   ```bash\n   install_name_tool -change lib/libopencv_core.3.0.dylib /full/path/to/libopencv_core.3.0.dylib /Users/luke/Desktop/trainHOG/trainhog\n   ```\n   Replace `/full/path/to/libopencv_core.3.0.dylib` with the actual full path of the library.\n\n3. **Check Library Compatibility**:\n   Ensure that the library version is compatible with the version of OpenCV you're using. Sometimes mismatches in versions can cause such issues.\n\n4. **Use rpath**:\n   You can try using the `@rpath` feature to embed the path directly in the executable. You can set the rpath using:\n   ```bash\n   install_name_tool -add_rpath /full/path/to/libraries /Users/luke/Desktop/trainHOG/trainhog\n   ```\n\n5. **Check for Other Dependencies**:\n   Ensure that all other dependencies required by OpenCV are present and correctly linked.\n\n6. **Recompile OpenCV**:\n   If none of the above works, consider recompiling OpenCV with the correct paths using CMake. Make sure to specify the installation path and any required flags.\n\n7. **Use Homebrew**:\n   If you're not already using it, consider using Homebrew to manage your installations. It often handles dependencies and paths better than manual installations.\n\n8. **Check for System Integrity**:\n   Make sure there are no system integrity issues by running:\n   ```bash\n   sudo spctl --master-disable\n   ```\n\nIf these steps do not resolve the issue, there might be a specific problem with the configuration of your environment or build setup. In such cases, providing more details about your setup or consulting with the OpenCV community may yield additional insights."
