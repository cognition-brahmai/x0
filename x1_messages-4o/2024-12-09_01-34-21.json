The traceback shows the error is coming from the 'tensorflow.python' import. Some people have solved it by adding \"export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-5.5/lib:/usr/local/cuda-5.5/lib64\" in the /etc/profile, but it's not working for me. I have found the \"libcudart.so.7.0\" file in /usr/share/man/man7/libcudart.so.7 by using the 'whereis' command. How can I resolve this error?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to TensorFlow not being able to find the CUDA runtime library `libcudart.so.7.0`. This is typically because the library is not in a directory that's included in your system's library search path. To resolve this, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Verify CUDA Installation**: Make sure that you have installed the correct version of CUDA that TensorFlow requires. You might be using an older version of CUDA. Check TensorFlow's compatibility with CUDA versions.\n\n2. **Check CUDA Path**: Ensure the CUDA toolkit and libraries are installed in the standard location, usually `/usr/local/cuda`. If not, you'll need to adjust the paths accordingly.\n\n3. **Locate the Correct `libcudart.so`**: You mentioned finding `libcudart.so.7` in the man directory, which is incorrect. You need the actual binary library file, not the man page. Use `locate` or `find` to search for `libcudart.so` in the typical CUDA installation directories like `/usr/local/cuda/lib64/`.\n\n    ```bash\n    sudo updatedb\n    locate libcudart.so\n    ```\n\n4. **Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH**: Once you find the correct path to `libcudart.so`, set your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include this directory. For instance:\n\n    ```bash\n    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda/lib64\n    ```\n\n   You can add the above line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` to make it persistent across sessions.\n\n5. **Update the System Library Cache**: If you have the correct path, you can add it to `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/cuda.conf` (create this file if it doesn't exist) and then run `sudo ldconfig` to update the cache.\n\n    ```bash\n    echo \"/usr/local/cuda/lib64\" | sudo tee -a /etc/ld.so.conf.d/cuda.conf\n    sudo ldconfig\n    ```\n\n6. **Reinstall TensorFlow**: If the above steps do not resolve the issue, consider reinstalling TensorFlow after ensuring your CUDA and cuDNN installations are compatible and properly configured.\n\n7. **Check TensorFlow Version**: Make sure the TensorFlow version you are trying to use is compatible with your installed CUDA version. Sometimes, upgrading or downgrading TensorFlow might solve the issue.\n\n8. **CUDA Soft Link**: If necessary, create a symbolic link to the correct version of the library TensorFlow expects. For example, if you have `libcudart.so.10.1`, you might link it like this:\n\n    ```bash\n    sudo ln -s /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudart.so.10.1 /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudart.so.7.0\n    ```\n\nAfter performing these steps, try running your Python script again. This should resolve the library path issue with TensorFlow."
