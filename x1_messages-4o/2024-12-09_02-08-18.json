        "content": "Creating a binary mask of a polygon and computing its distance transform involves a few steps. Here's how you can achieve this using standard Python packages like NumPy and SciPy, along with matplotlib for handling the polygon:\n\n1. **Create the Binary Mask:**\n\n   First, you need to create a binary mask where the polygon's area is marked with `1`s and the rest of the image is `0`s. You can use the `matplotlib.path.Path` module to check which points lie inside the polygon.\n\n   ```python\n   import numpy as np\n   from matplotlib.path import Path\n\n   def create_polygon_mask(image_shape, polygon_vertices):\n       # Create an empty binary mask\n       mask = np.zeros(image_shape, dtype=np.uint8)\n\n       # Create a Path object from the polygon vertices\n       poly_path = Path(polygon_vertices)\n\n       # Get the x and y indices of the image\n       x, y = np.meshgrid(np.arange(image_shape[1]), np.arange(image_shape[0]))\n\n       # Flatten x and y to iterate over all points\n       x, y = x.flatten(), y.flatten()\n       points = np.vstack((x, y)).T\n\n       # Determine which points are inside the polygon\n       mask_inside_polygon = poly_path.contains_points(points)\n\n       # Reshape the mask to the image shape\n       mask = mask_inside_polygon.reshape(image_shape)\n\n       return mask\n\n   # Example usage\n   image_shape = (100, 100)  # Dimensions of the image\n   polygon_vertices = [(30, 30), (70, 30), (70, 70), (30, 70)]  # Vertices of the polygon\n   mask = create_polygon_mask(image_shape, polygon_vertices)\n   ```\n\n2. **Compute the Distance Transform:**\n\n   Once you have the binary mask, you can use `scipy.ndimage.morphology.distance_transform_edt` to compute the distance transform.\n\n   ```python\n   from scipy.ndimage import distance_transform_edt\n\n   # Compute the distance transform\n   distance_transform = distance_transform_edt(mask == 0)\n   ```\n\n3. **Visualizing the Results (Optional):**\n\n   You might want to visualize the binary mask and the distance transform to verify that everything is working correctly.\n\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n   # Display the binary mask\n   plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)\n   plt.title(\"Binary Mask\")\n   plt.imshow(mask, cmap='gray')\n\n   # Display the distance transform\n   plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)\n   plt.title(\"Distance Transform\")\n   plt.imshow(distance_transform, cmap='hot')\n   plt.colorbar()\n\n   plt.show()\n   ```\n\nThis code will give you a binary mask of the polygon and compute the distance transform of that mask. The `distance_transform_edt` function calculates the Euclidean distance from each pixel to the nearest zero pixel, effectively giving you a distance map of the polygon's boundary."
