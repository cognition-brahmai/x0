        "content": "Yes, you can convert a sentence into Pig Latin using Python. Here's a simple way to do it:\n\n```python\ndef convert_to_pig_latin(sentence):\n    def pig_latin_word(word):\n        vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n        if word[0] in vowels:\n            return word + \"yay\"\n        else:\n            for i, letter in enumerate(word):\n                if letter in vowels:\n                    return word[i:] + word[:i] + \"ay\"\n            return word + \"ay\"  # If no vowel is found\n\n    words = sentence.split()\n    pig_latin_words = [pig_latin_word(word) for word in words]\n    return ' '.join(pig_latin_words)\n\n# Example usage\nsentence = \"Hello world this is an example\"\npig_latin_sentence = convert_to_pig_latin(sentence)\nprint(pig_latin_sentence)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Function `pig_latin_word(word)`**: Converts a single word into Pig Latin.\n  - If the word starts with a vowel, add \"yay\" to the end.\n  - If the word starts with a consonant, move all leading consonants to the end and add \"ay\".\n- **Sentence Processing**: Splits the sentence into words, converts each to Pig Latin, and then joins them back together.\n\nYou can test this with different sentences to see how it works!"
