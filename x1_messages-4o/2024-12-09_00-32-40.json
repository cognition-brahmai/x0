Despite referencing multiple posts and trying the proposed solutions, I am still experiencing difficulties. I have encoded text sequences of variable length in a batch of size 12, and these sequences are padded and packed using the \"pad_packed_sequence\" functionality. I set \"MAX_LEN\" for each sequence at 384, and each token in the sequence has a dimension of 768. Therefore, my batch tensor could have one of the following shapes: [12, 384, 768] or [384, 12, 768]. This batch will be my input to the PyTorch rnn module (LSTM). According to the PyTorch documentation for LSTMs, its input dimensions are (seq_len, batch, input_size). However, I am not clear on what the exact \"input_size\" and \"hidden_size\" should be in the following code: \"lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size=?, hidden_size=?, batch_first=True)\". Can someone help me understand the correct values to use for \"input_size\" and \"hidden_size\"?"

        "content": "When working with LSTMs in PyTorch, understanding the input shapes and parameters is crucial for setting up your network correctly. Let's break down the requirements based on your description:\n\n1. **Input Size (`input_size`)**: This parameter should match the dimensionality of each token in your sequence. In your case, since each token has a dimension of 768, you should set `input_size=768`.\n\n2. **Hidden Size (`hidden_size`)**: This parameter specifies the number of features in the hidden state of the LSTM. This is a hyperparameter that you can choose based on your specific task and requirements. Typical values might be 128, 256, 512, etc. It determines the capacity of your LSTM to learn from the data. Larger values might capture more complex patterns but also increase the risk of overfitting.\n\nGiven your setup, you mentioned using `batch_first=True`, which means your input tensor should have the shape `[batch, seq_len, input_size]`. Therefore, your input tensor should be shaped as `[12, 384, 768]`.\n\nHere is how you might define your LSTM in PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\n# Define LSTM parameters\ninput_size = 768   # Dimensionality of each token\nhidden_size = 256  # Number of features in the hidden state (you can adjust this value)\n\n# Instantiate the LSTM\nlstm = nn.LSTM(input_size=input_size, hidden_size=hidden_size, batch_first=True)\n\n# Example input tensor with shape [batch_size, seq_len, input_size]\nexample_input = torch.randn(12, 384, 768)\n\n# Pass the input through the LSTM\noutput, (hn, cn) = lstm(example_input)\n\n# Output will have shape [batch_size, seq_len, hidden_size]\nprint(output.shape)\n```\n\nThe `hidden_size` is a choice you make considering the complexity of the task and computational resources. Experimenting with different values can help you find the optimal configuration for your specific use case."
