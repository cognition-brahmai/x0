My problem is that only the horizontal grid lines are showing up by default and I'm not sure why the vertical lines aren't appearing. I have tried adding specific code to generate the vertical lines but this hasn't worked. Here's the code I've tried:\n\n```python\ndata.plot()\ngrid('on')\n```\nand\n\n```python\nax = plt.axes()        \nax.yaxis.grid() # horizontal lines\nax.xaxis.grid() # vertical lines\n```\n\nDespite these attempts, I'm still not seeing the vertical gridlines on my plot. Can anyone suggest what I might be doing wrong or if there's a different approach I should take?"

        "content": "To ensure that both horizontal and vertical grid lines are displayed on your plot using Matplotlib, you need to make sure that you're setting the grid for both axes correctly. The issue might be related to how the `grid` function or the `ax.xaxis.grid()` and `ax.yaxis.grid()` methods are being called. Let me provide you with a refined approach to ensure that both horizontal and vertical grid lines are displayed:\n\n1. Import the necessary libraries.\n2. Make sure that you create a plot with a specific `Axes` object.\n3. Enable the grid with both `x` and `y` axis grid lines.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming 'data' is your DataFrame obtained from an SQL query\n# data = pd.DataFrame(...) \n\n# Plot the data\nax = data.plot()\n\n# Enable grid lines for both axes\nax.grid(True, which='both')  # Enable grid for both x and y axes\n\n# Alternatively, you can specify the axis parameter\n# ax.grid(True, which='both', axis='both')\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- `ax.grid(True, which='both')` ensures that grid lines are shown for both the x-axis and y-axis.\n- Using `axis='both'` is implicit in `which='both'`, but it's worth mentioning if you want to specify the axis directly.\n- Make sure you call `plt.show()` after setting the grid to display the plot correctly.\n\nIf you're still experiencing issues, ensure that:\n- Your DataFrame `data` is correctly structured and contains the data you intend to plot.\n- There aren't any additional settings or styles being applied that might override the grid settings.\n\nThis approach should resolve the issue and display both horizontal and vertical grid lines on your plot."
