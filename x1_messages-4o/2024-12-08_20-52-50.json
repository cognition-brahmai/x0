        "content": "To calculate the total revenue generated by each product in your sales data using Excel, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Add a New Column for Revenue**: First, add a new column to your table to calculate the revenue for each order. In this column, multiply the Quantity by the Price per Unit. Assuming this new column is labeled \"Revenue\" and placed in column E, the formula in cell E2 would be:\n\n   ```excel\n   =C2 * D2\n   ```\n\n   Drag this formula down to fill the entire column for all rows.\n\n2. **Use a Pivot Table**: To get the total revenue for each product, you can use a Pivot Table:\n\n   - Select your entire table (including the new Revenue column).\n   - Go to the \"Insert\" tab on the Ribbon and click on \"PivotTable.\"\n   - Choose where you want the PivotTable to be placed (e.g., a new worksheet).\n   - In the PivotTable Field List, drag \"Product\" to the Rows area and \"Revenue\" to the Values area.\n   - Ensure that the Values area is set to \"Sum of Revenue\" to get the total revenue for each product.\n\n3. **Using SUMIFS Function**: Alternatively, you can use the `SUMIFS` function directly to calculate the total revenue for each product without using a Pivot Table. Here's how you can individually calculate it for each product:\n\n   - **Product1**:\n\n     ```excel\n     =SUMIFS(E2:E11, B2:B11, \"Product1\")\n     ```\n\n   - **Product2**:\n\n     ```excel\n     =SUMIFS(E2:E11, B2:B11, \"Product2\")\n     ```\n\n   - **Product3**:\n\n     ```excel\n     =SUMIFS(E2:E11, B2:B11, \"Product3\")\n     ```\n\nThese formulas will sum the revenue for each product separately. By using either a Pivot Table or the `SUMIFS` function, you can quickly obtain the total revenue for each product in your dataset."
