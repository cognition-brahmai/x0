        "content": "Certainly! For a web project where you need to separate HTML generation from form validation and also require validation errors to be easily serialized, you might want to consider using **WTForms** in conjunction with **WTForms-JSON**.\n\n### WTForms\nWTForms is a flexible forms validation and rendering library for Python web development. It does not generate HTML, which allows you to separate your form logic from your presentation logic easily. You can define your forms in Python and handle validation independently.\n\n- **Installation**: You can install WTForms using pip:\n\n  ```bash\n  pip install wtforms\n  ```\n\n- **Basic Usage**: You define form fields and validators in a Python class. WTForms provides a variety of built-in validators, such as `DataRequired`, `Email`, `Length`, etc.\n\n### WTForms-JSON\nWTForms-JSON is an extension for WTForms that allows you to deserialize JSON objects into WTForms forms and also serialize errors back into JSON, which is particularly useful for API endpoints.\n\n- **Installation**: Install WTForms-JSON using pip:\n\n  ```bash\n  pip install wtforms-json\n  ```\n\n- **Using WTForms-JSON**: You can integrate it with WTForms to handle JSON data:\n\n  ```python\n  from wtforms import Form, StringField, validators\n  from wtforms_json import init\n\n  init()\n\n  class MyForm(Form):\n      name = StringField('name', [validators.DataRequired()])\n      email = StringField('email', [validators.Email()])\n\n  # Example JSON input\n  json_data = {\n      \"name\": \"\",\n      \"email\": \"invalid-email\"\n  }\n\n  form = MyForm.from_json(json_data)\n\n  if not form.validate():\n      # Serialize errors to JSON\n      errors = form.errors\n      print(errors)  # {'name': ['This field is required.'], 'email': ['Invalid email address.']}\n  ```\n\nThis setup gives you the flexibility to manage form validation separately from the HTML generation and easily work with JSON data, making it suitable for modern web applications, including those with RESTful APIs."
