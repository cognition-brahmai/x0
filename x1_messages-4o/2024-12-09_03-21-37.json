        "content": "In Python, I have a class with a number of methods. I am trying to have a static method with the same name as a regular method in the class so that it can handle more arguments. I am using the `@staticmethod` decorator to create the static method. However, when I call the static method using the class name, I get a `TypeError` saying that I'm missing the 'self' argument. This happens in both Python 2.7 and 3.3. Here's the code I am using:\n\n```python\nclass myclass:\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def foo():\n        return 'static method'\n\n    def foo(self):\n        return 'public method'\n\nobj = myclass()\nprint(obj.foo())\nprint(myclass.foo())\n```\n\nI expect it to print:\n```\npublic method\nstatic method\n```\nbut instead it prints:\n```\npublic method\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"sandbox.py\", line 14, in &lt;module&gt;\n    print(myclass.foo())\nTypeError: foo() missing 1 required positional argument: 'self'\n```\nWhy does this happen and how can I modify my code so it gives the expected output?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the method name collision within your class. In Python, when you define two methods with the same name in a class, the latter definition will override the former. This means that your `foo` method defined as a regular instance method is overriding the `foo` static method.\n\nTo achieve what you want, you need to use different method names for the static method and the instance method. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def static_foo():\n        return 'static method'\n\n    def foo(self):\n        return 'public method'\n\nobj = MyClass()\nprint(obj.foo())           # Prints 'public method'\nprint(MyClass.static_foo()) # Prints 'static method'\n```\n\nIn this modified code, I've renamed the static method to `static_foo` to avoid the naming conflict. Now, you can call the instance method `foo` on an object of the class, and the static method `static_foo` directly on the class itself, which will give you the expected output."
