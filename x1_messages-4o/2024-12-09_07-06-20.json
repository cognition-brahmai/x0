I've tried to use the `setup_requires` parameter, but it fails if Cython is not already installed. Here's the error I'm encountering:\n\n```\n$ python setup.py install\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"setup.py\", line 2, in <module>\n    from Cython.Build import cythonize\nImportError: No module named Cython.Build\n```\n\nBelow is the `setup.py` code I have so far:\n\n```python\nfrom setuptools import setup, Extension\nfrom Cython.Build import cythonize\n\nsetup(\n    name=...,\n    ...,\n    setup_requires=['Cython'],\n    ...,\n    ext_modules=cythonize([ ... ]),\n)\n```\n\nWhat's the proper way to ensure that Cython is imported only after the `setup_requires` step runs, but is also available to specify the `ext_modules` values?"

        "content": "To make sure that your `setup.py` works even if Cython is not initially installed, you can use a conditional import for Cython and handle the installation of Cython as part of the setup process. The key is to delay the import and compilation until after you have ensured that Cython is installed.\n\nHere's an approach to achieve this:\n\n1. Use a try-except block to check if Cython is available.\n2. If Cython is not available, fall back to using the pre-generated C files.\n3. Use a custom function to handle the conditional import and setup of extensions.\n\nHere's how you can modify your `setup.py`:\n\n```python\nfrom setuptools import setup, Extension\nfrom setuptools.command.build_ext import build_ext\nimport os\n\n# Attempt to import Cython\ntry:\n    from Cython.Build import cythonize\n    cython_available = True\nexcept ImportError:\n    cython_available = False\n\n# Define your extensions\next_modules = [\n    Extension(\"module_name\", [\"module_name.pyx\" if cython_available else \"module_name.c\"]),\n    # Add more extensions as needed\n]\n\n# If Cython is available, use cythonize\nif cython_available:\n    ext_modules = cythonize(ext_modules)\n\n# Custom build_ext class to ensure Cython is installed if needed\nclass OptionalBuildExt(build_ext):\n    def run(self):\n        try:\n            # Ensure Cython is installed if we need it\n            if cython_available:\n                self.distribution.fetch_build_eggs(['Cython'])\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(\"Error fetching build eggs: \", e)\n        super().run()\n\n# Setup function\nsetup(\n    name='your_package_name',\n    version='0.1',\n    description='Your package description',\n    author='Your Name',\n    author_email='your_email@example.com',\n    cmdclass={'build_ext': OptionalBuildExt},\n    ext_modules=ext_modules,\n    setup_requires=['Cython'] if cython_available else [],\n    install_requires=[\n        # Add other runtime dependencies here\n    ],\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Conditional Import**: The script first tries to import Cython. If it's not available, it sets `cython_available` to `False`. This is used to determine whether to compile `.pyx` files or use the pre-generated `.c` files.\n\n- **Custom `build_ext` class**: `OptionalBuildExt` is a custom class that ensures Cython is installed if it's needed. It overrides the `run` method to check for Cython and fetch it if necessary.\n\n- **`ext_modules` Setup**: Depending on whether Cython is available, it either compiles the `.pyx` files or uses the existing `.c` files.\n\n- **`setup_requires`**: This is conditionally set to include Cython only if it's initially available, avoiding unnecessary dependency errors.\n\nWith this setup, your package should be able to install even if Cython isn't pre-installed on the user's system, as long as you provide the generated `.c` files alongside your `.pyx` files."
