It uses a regular expression to check these conditions. Here's the explanation of the code and the regular expression used:\n\n1. **`Regex.IsMatch`**: This method checks if the input string matches the specified regular expression pattern.\n\n2. **Regular Expression Pattern (`@\"^[a-zA-Z]{3,}$\"`)**: \n   - `^` asserts the start of the string.\n   - `[a-zA-Z]` specifies that the characters can be either uppercase (A-Z) or lowercase (a-z) alphabets.\n   - `{3,}` specifies that there must be at least 3 or more of the preceding element (alphabets in this case).\n   - `$` asserts the end of the string.\n\nTherefore, the pattern `@\"^[a-zA-Z]{3,}$\"` ensures that the input consists of only alphabets and is at least 3 characters long.\n\nHere's the complete code snippet for clarity:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Text.RegularExpressions;  // Required for Regex\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Enter your name:\");\n        string inputName = Console.ReadLine();\n\n        if (Regex.IsMatch(inputName, @\"^[a-zA-Z]{3,}$\"))\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Hello {0}!\", inputName);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Invalid name input.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Case Sensitivity**: The regular expression is case-insensitive as it explicitly includes both `a-z` and `A-Z`.\n- **Whitespace**: This pattern does not allow spaces. If you want to allow spaces between first and last names, you may need to adjust the pattern to include spaces within names.\n- **Culture-Specific Characters**: If you need support for culture-specific alphabets or special characters, consider using Unicode character classes or adjusting the pattern accordingly.\n\nThis method ensures robust validation for names in your application."
