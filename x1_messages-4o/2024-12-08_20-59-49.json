The rise in global temperatures is mainly due to increased levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, largely resulting from human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. This warming leads to various environmental impacts, such as melting ice caps, rising sea levels, increased frequency and severity of weather events like floods and droughts, and disruptions to natural ecosystems\u2014all of which pose significant risks to both the environment and human societies."
