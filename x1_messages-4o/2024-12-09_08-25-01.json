Some modules have attributes such as `module.VERSION` or `module.__version__` that provide this information, but these modules do not. I am looking for a solution that doesn't involve reading the source code at runtime, hashing it, and then comparing it to the hash of the known version."

        "content": "To check the version of the Python modules `libxslt` and `libxml2` at runtime, you can use the following methods, which rely on the `etree` module from the `lxml` package. This package provides bindings for the `libxslt` and `libxml2` libraries and includes version information.\n\nHere's how you can find out the version of these libraries:\n\n1. **Using `lxml.etree`**:\n\n   The `lxml.etree` module provides attributes that contain the version information for both `libxslt` and `libxml2`. You can access these attributes as follows:\n\n   ```python\n   from lxml import etree\n\n   # Get the version of libxml2\n   libxml2_version = etree.LIBXML_VERSION\n   print(\"libxml2 version:\", libxml2_version)\n\n   # Get the version of libxslt\n   libxslt_version = etree.LIBXSLT_VERSION\n   print(\"libxslt version:\", libxslt_version)\n   ```\n\n   The `LIBXML_VERSION` and `LIBXSLT_VERSION` constants are tuples with three integer elements representing the major, minor, and micro version numbers.\n\n2. **Using `pkg_resources` (if available)**:\n\n   If the module was installed via a package manager and is part of a Python package, you might also be able to retrieve the version using `pkg_resources` from `setuptools`. However, this is more relevant to Python packages rather than C libraries wrapped in Python bindings:\n\n   ```python\n   import pkg_resources\n\n   try:\n       libxml2_version = pkg_resources.get_distribution(\"libxml2-python\").version\n       print(\"libxml2 version:\", libxml2_version)\n   except pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound:\n       print(\"libxml2 package not found.\")\n\n   try:\n       libxslt_version = pkg_resources.get_distribution(\"libxslt-python\").version\n       print(\"libxslt version:\", libxslt_version)\n   except pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound:\n       print(\"libxslt package not found.\")\n   ```\n\n   Note that the above method requires the Python package names to be known and correct, which might not always be the case for C library bindings.\n\nBy using these methods, you should be able to determine the version of the `libxslt` and `libxml2` libraries at runtime in Python without having to manually inspect or hash the source code."
