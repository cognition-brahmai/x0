The clues are as follows:\nRoom 1: \"My code is 8-3-1-4. I am composed of 80% nitrogen and 20% oxygen, with a temperature decreasing linearly from 290 K at the surface to 260 K at 100 km.\"\nRoom 2: \"My code is 6-0-2-0. I am composed of 70% carbon dioxide, 20% nitrogen, and 10% oxygen, with a temperature decreasing linearly from 260 K at 100 km to 240 K at 200 km.\"\nRoom 3: \"My code is 5-0-4-0. I am composed of 50% nitrogen, 40% carbon dioxide, and 10% oxygen, with a temperature decreasing linearly from 240 K at 200 km to 220 K at 300 km.\"\nRoom 4: \"My code is 6-0-4-0. I am composed of 60% nitrogen and 40% oxygen, with a temperature decreasing linearly from 220 K at 300 km to 200 K at 400 km.\"\nYou need to use these clues to figure out the correct order of the code and unlock the door. However, there's a catch! To unlock each keyhole, you need to calculate the gas density at an altitude of 150 km for the corresponding room's composition. You can use the constants given below to write a Python code to calculate the gas density:\n- Gas constant = 8.314 J/mol/K\n- Earth's surface gravity = 9.81 m/s^2\n- Avogadro's number = 6.02 x 10^23 molecules/mol\n- Earth's atmosphere at sea level has a pressure of 101325 Pa and a temperature of 288 K\nGood luck with unlocking the doors and escaping the rooms!"

We will use the ideal gas law and the barometric formula to estimate the density. Here's a Python code to calculate the density for each room:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nR = 8.314  # J/mol/K, gas constant\ng = 9.81  # m/s^2, Earth's surface gravity\nP0 = 101325  # Pa, sea level standard atmospheric pressure\nT0 = 288  # K, sea level standard atmospheric temperature\nN_A = 6.02e23  # molecules/mol, Avogadro's number\n\n# Function to calculate density\ndef calculate_density(percentage_N2, percentage_O2, percentage_CO2, T_surface, T_100km, altitude):\n    # Calculate average molar mass\n    molar_mass_N2 = 28.02  # g/mol\n    molar_mass_O2 = 32.00  # g/mol\n    molar_mass_CO2 = 44.01  # g/mol\n\n    molar_mass = (percentage_N2 * molar_mass_N2 +\n                  percentage_O2 * molar_mass_O2 +\n                  percentage_CO2 * molar_mass_CO2) / 100\n\n    # Temperature at 150 km\n    T_150km = T_surface - ((T_surface - T_100km) / 100) * altitude\n\n    # Calculate pressure at 150 km using the barometric formula\n    P_150km = P0 * math.exp(-molar_mass * g * altitude * 1000 / (R * T_150km))\n\n    # Density calculation (\u03c1 = P * M / (R * T))\n    density = P_150km * molar_mass / (R * T_150km)\n\n    # Convert density to kg/m^3\n    density_kg_m3 = density / 1000  # as molar mass was in g/mol\n\n    return density_kg_m3\n\n# Room 1\ndensity_room1 = calculate_density(80, 20, 0, 290, 260, 150)\nprint(f\"Room 1 Density at 150 km: {density_room1:.4f} kg/m^3\")\n\n# Room 2\ndensity_room2 = calculate_density(20, 10, 70, 260, 240, 150)\nprint(f\"Room 2 Density at 150 km: {density_room2:.4f} kg/m^3\")\n\n# Room 3\ndensity_room3 = calculate_density(50, 10, 40, 240, 220, 150)\nprint(f\"Room 3 Density at 150 km: {density_room3:.4f} kg/m^3\")\n\n# Room 4\ndensity_room4 = calculate_density(60, 40, 0, 220, 200, 150)\nprint(f\"Room 4 Density at 150 km: {density_room4:.4f} kg/m^3\")\n```\n\nThis script calculates the density at 150 km for each room using the provided atmospheric composition and temperature profile. The densities will help us identify the correct room to enter based on the calculated values and any additional context or criteria that might be provided, such as which density value should be targeted to unlock the door."
