Should subplots only contain data? Is it considered good practice to style, clear a plot, etc., inside of subplots?"

        "content": "In matplotlib, understanding the difference between `plt`, `figure`, and `ax` is crucial for effectively creating and managing plots. Let me break it down for you:\n\n### `plt` (Pyplot)\n- `plt` is a module in matplotlib that provides a MATLAB-like interface for plotting. It is usually imported as `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`.\n- It is a state-based interface that allows for quick and easy plotting. You can create plots without explicitly creating figure or axes objects, as `plt` manages them for you internally.\n- You would typically use `plt` for simple, quick plots where you don't need advanced customization or when you're dealing with a single plot.\n\n### `figure`\n- A `figure` in matplotlib is a top-level container for all plot elements. It is essentially the canvas or area where plots are drawn.\n- You can create a figure using `plt.figure()`, which allows for more control over the plot, such as setting the size, resolution, and more.\n- The purpose of a figure is to organize and manage multiple plots (axes) that can be displayed together. It is useful when you want to create complex, multi-plot figures or when you need to make specific adjustments to your plotting canvas.\n\n### `ax` (Axes)\n- `ax` (short for axes) represents an individual plot or graph within a figure. It is the area where data is actually plotted, including the x and y axes, ticks, labels, etc.\n- You can create axes using `fig.add_subplot()` or `plt.subplots()`, which allows you to specify the layout and number of plots within a figure.\n- Axes objects are used for detailed customization and manipulation of individual plots. You can add titles, labels, legends, and more directly to an `ax` object.\n\n### When to Use Them\n- **Use `plt` for:** Quick, simple plots where you don't need to manage multiple axes or require advanced customization.\n- **Use `figure` and `ax` for:** Complex plots with multiple subplots, when you need precise control over layout and aesthetics, or when you are creating plots programmatically for consistency and reusability.\n\n### Subplots and Styling\n- **Subplots can contain both data and styling.** While the primary purpose of subplots is to display data, you can and should apply styling to make your plots more informative and aesthetically pleasing. This includes titles, labels, colors, line styles, etc.\n- **Clearing plots:** It's generally good practice to clear or reset subplots when reusing the same figure or axes objects to avoid unwanted plot elements carrying over. This can be done using `ax.clear()` or `plt.clf()` for the figure.\n\nBy understanding and using these components appropriately, you can create well-structured and visually appealing plots with matplotlib."
