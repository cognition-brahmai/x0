Here is an example of the list structure I am dealing with:\n\n```python\nx = [u'sam', [['Test', [['one', [], []]], [(u'file.txt', ['id', 1, 0])]], ['Test2', [], [(u'file2.txt', ['id', 1, 2])]]], []]\n```"

        "content": "To iterate through a list that contains other irregularly nested lists, you can use a recursive function. This function will check if an element is a list and, if so, call itself to process the sublist. Here's an example of how you can accomplish this:\n\n```python\ndef iterate_nested_list(nested_list):\n    for element in nested_list:\n        if isinstance(element, list):\n            # If the element is a list, recursively call the function\n            iterate_nested_list(element)\n        else:\n            # If the element is not a list, process it\n            print(element)\n\n# Example usage\nx = [\n    u'sam',\n    [\n        ['Test', [['one', [], []]], [(u'file.txt', ['id', 1, 0])]],\n        ['Test2', [], [(u'file2.txt', ['id', 1, 2])]]\n    ],\n    []\n]\n\niterate_nested_list(x)\n```\n\nThis function, `iterate_nested_list`, iterates through each element of the list `x`. If an element is a list, it recursively processes it until it reaches non-list elements, which it then prints. You can modify the part where `print(element)` is called to perform any other operation you need."
