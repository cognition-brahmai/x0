The traceback is as follows:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"./manage.py\", line 8, in &lt;module&gt;\nfrom django.core.management import execute_from_command_line\nFile \"/home/rats/rats/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/core/management   \n/__init__.py\", line 4, in &lt;module&gt;\nfrom optparse import OptionParser, NO_DEFAULT\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/optparse.py\", line 77, in &lt;module&gt;\nimport textwrap\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/textwrap.py\", line 10, in &lt;module&gt;\nimport string, re\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/string.py\", line 83, in &lt;module&gt;\nimport re as _re\nFile \"/home/rats/rats/lib/python2.7/re.py\", line 105, in &lt;module&gt;\nimport sre_compile\nFile \"/home/rats/rats/lib/python2.7/sre_compile.py\", line 14, in &lt;module&gt;\nimport sre_parse\nFile \"/home/rats/rats/lib/python2.7/sre_parse.py\", line 17, in &lt;module&gt;\nfrom sre_constants import *\nFile \"/home/rats/rats/lib/python2.7/sre_constants.py\", line 18, in &lt;module&gt;\nfrom _sre import MAXREPEAT\nImportError: cannot import name MAXREPEAT\n```\n\nThis is happening for both the real environment as well as for the virtual environment. In an attempt to fix the issue, I tried removing python using `sudo apt-get remove python`, but it has removed everything and now even Google Chrome does not show any fonts. Can you help me configure my system properly again?"

        "content": "It sounds like you're dealing with a couple of issues stemming from the recent upgrade to Ubuntu 13.04 and the removal of Python, which is a critical component of your system.\n\n### Step 1: Fixing Python Installation\n\n1. **Reinstall Python**:\n   - Since Python is a core part of the Ubuntu system, you need to reinstall it. Run the following command to reinstall Python 2.7:\n\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt-get update\n     sudo apt-get install --reinstall python2.7 python2.7-minimal\n     ```\n\n2. **Reinstall Python Packages**:\n   - If you had any specific Python packages installed, you might need to reinstall them. Use `pip` to reinstall necessary packages in your virtual environment.\n\n3. **Check Python Path**:\n   - Ensure that your system is using the correct Python version. You can check with `which python` or `python --version`.\n\n### Step 2: Fixing the ImportError\n\n1. **Check Python Installation**:\n   - Ensure that the default Python libraries are intact. The `MAXREPEAT` error indicates an issue with the Python `re` module, which is part of the standard library.\n\n2. **Recreate Virtual Environment**:\n   - If the error persists, try recreating your virtual environment:\n   \n     ```bash\n     deactivate  # If you're in the virtual environment\n     rm -rf your_virtualenv/\n     virtualenv your_virtualenv\n     source your_virtualenv/bin/activate\n     pip install -r requirements.txt\n     ```\n\n### Step 3: Fixing System Fonts and Other Issues\n\n1. **Reinstall Missing Packages**:\n   - Since removing Python might have removed other critical packages, reinstall some of the core packages:\n\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\n     sudo apt-get install --reinstall fonts-liberation\n     ```\n\n2. **Check System Logs**:\n   - Check `/var/log/syslog` or other relevant logs for any errors that might indicate further missing components.\n\n3. **Reinstall Google Chrome**:\n   - If the fonts are still not displaying correctly in Chrome, try reinstalling it:\n\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt-get remove google-chrome-stable\n     sudo apt-get install google-chrome-stable\n     ```\n\n### Additional Recommendations\n\n- **Backup and Data Safety**: Always ensure you have backups before making significant changes to your system.\n- **Consider Upgrading**: Ubuntu 13.04 is quite outdated. Consider upgrading to a more recent version of Ubuntu for better support and security updates.\n- **Use Python Virtual Environments**: Continue using virtual environments (`venv` or `virtualenv`) to manage dependencies for different projects separately.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to restore your system to proper working condition. If issues persist, consider seeking help from Ubuntu or Python-specific forums for more targeted assistance."
