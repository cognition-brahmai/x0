For instance, when I execute the following code:\n\n```python\nprint([x for x in itertools.permutations('1234')])\n```\n\nThe output I get is a list of tuples:\n\n```python\n[('1', '2', '3', '4'), ('1', '2', '4', '3'), ('1', '3', '2', '4') ... ]\n```\n\nInstead, why doesn't it return a list of strings like this?\n\n```python\n['1234', '1243', '1324' ... ]\n```"

        "content": "The `itertools.permutations()` function in Python returns tuples rather than strings for each permutation because it is designed to work with any iterable, not just strings. By returning tuples, it maintains flexibility in handling different types of input sequences, such as lists, tuples, or any iterable object, where the elements might not necessarily be characters.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why tuples are used:\n\n1. **General Purpose**: `itertools.permutations()` is intended for general use with any iterable. Returning tuples ensures that the elements' order is preserved without assuming the type or structure of the input.\n\n2. **Immutable Structure**: Tuples are immutable, which makes them a safe choice for representing permutations as they cannot be altered accidentally.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: Constructing tuples is generally more efficient than constructing strings, especially when dealing with large numbers of permutations.\n\n4. **Flexibility**: By returning tuples, the function allows users to decide how to handle the permutations. If strings are needed, users can easily convert tuples to strings themselves.\n\nIf you want to convert the output to a list of strings, you can do so using a simple list comprehension:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nperms = [''.join(p) for p in itertools.permutations('1234')]\nprint(perms)\n```\n\nThis will give you the desired output:\n\n```python\n['1234', '1243', '1324', ...]\n```\n\nThis approach leverages the flexibility of the function, allowing you to convert the tuples to strings as needed for your specific use case."
