However, \"pylint\" is returning an error message indicating that my variable names are invalid. The variable names in question are \"url_to_short\", \"post_url\", and \"headers\". Is this a violation of coding conventions?

        "content": "The variable names you've used\u2014`url_to_short`, `post_url`, and `headers`\u2014are actually quite typical for Python code and are clear in their purpose. However, `pylint` seems to be configured to expect constant variable names to be in all uppercase, which is why it's flagging them as invalid. Let's break down the issues:\n\n1. **Pylint Configuration**: By default, `pylint` expects constant names to be in uppercase, following the convention that constants should be ALL_CAPS. If `pylint` is treating your variables as constants, it would expect names like `URL_TO_SHORT`, `POST_URL`, and `HEADERS`. \n\n2. **Variable Naming**: Your variable names are indeed following the lower_snake_case convention, which is standard for regular variables and function names in Python.\n\n3. **Pylint Settings**: You can configure `pylint` to relax its rules on naming conventions if these are not constants. This can be done by modifying the configuration file or the command line options. Alternatively, you can add comments to disable specific warnings if you want to keep using these names:\n\n   ```python\n   # pylint: disable=invalid-name\n   ```\n\n4. **Docstring Warning**: `pylint` also mentions a missing module-level docstring. It's generally a good practice to include a brief description of what the script does at the top of the file. You can add something like this:\n\n   ```python\n   \"\"\"\n   This script posts a long URL to Google's URL shortener API using a POST request.\n   \"\"\"\n   ```\n\nTo summarize, your variable names are fine for regular variables, but if you intend them to be constants, you should rename them in uppercase. If they're not constants, you can adjust `pylint` settings to avoid these warnings."
