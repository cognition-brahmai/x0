        "content": "To check if specific text is present on a web page using Selenium 2 and Python, you can use the `find_element_by_xpath` method to locate elements containing the text. However, if you're checking directly for the presence of text without concern for its HTML structure, you can use `driver.page_source` and simply check if the text is present in the page source. Here's a straightforward approach you can use:\n\n1. **Using `page_source`:**\n\n   This method is simple and works well if you just want to check for plain text within the HTML of the page.\n\n   ```python\n   from selenium import webdriver\n\n   # Initialize the WebDriver (make sure to have the appropriate driver executable)\n   driver = webdriver.Chrome()\n\n   # Navigate to the desired URL\n   driver.get('http://example.com')\n\n   # Check if the text is present in the page source\n   if \"email\" in driver.page_source:\n       print(\"Text is present on the page.\")\n   else:\n       print(\"Text is not present on the page.\")\n\n   # Close the browser\n   driver.quit()\n   ```\n\n2. **Using XPath:**\n\n   If you need more control or want to locate the text within a specific element, you can use XPath.\n\n   ```python\n   from selenium import webdriver\n   from selenium.common.exceptions import NoSuchElementException\n\n   # Initialize the WebDriver\n   driver = webdriver.Chrome()\n\n   # Navigate to the desired URL\n   driver.get('http://example.com')\n\n   # Try to find the element containing the specific text\n   try:\n       # This XPath will search for any element containing the text \"email\"\n       element = driver.find_element_by_xpath(\"//*[contains(text(), 'email')]\")\n       print(\"Text is present on the page.\")\n   except NoSuchElementException:\n       print(\"Text is not present on the page.\")\n\n   # Close the browser\n   driver.quit()\n   ```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Ensure that you have the appropriate WebDriver executable in your PATH or specify its location when initializing the WebDriver.\n- Consider handling exceptions like `NoSuchElementException` to deal with cases where the text is not found.\n- You may need to customize the XPath if the text is within a specific type of element or if it needs to be more precise.\n- Make sure the page has fully loaded before performing the check. You might need to add waits using Selenium's `WebDriverWait` if the page loads dynamically."
