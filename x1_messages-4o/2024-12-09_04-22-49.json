I don't want to put them into one list, rather I want to dump several times into the same file. But when I try to load the objects again using the code `myob = cpickle.load(g1.readlines()[2])`, where g1 is the file, I get an EOF error because my pickled object is longer than one line. Is there a method to load my pickled object properly?"

        "content": "When working with multiple pickled objects in a single file, you should avoid trying to read them line-by-line, as pickled objects can span multiple lines. Instead, you should sequentially load each object using the `pickle` module (or `cPickle` in Python 2, but `pickle` in Python 3).\n\nHere's a method to dump multiple objects to a file and then load them back:\n\n### Dumping Multiple Pickled Objects\n\n```python\nimport pickle\n\n# Define your objects\nobject1 = {\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2\"}\nobject2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nobject3 = (\"tuple\", \"with\", \"values\")\n\n# Open the file in binary write mode\nwith open('my_objects.pkl', 'wb') as file:\n    # Dump each object separately\n    pickle.dump(object1, file)\n    pickle.dump(object2, file)\n    pickle.dump(object3, file)\n```\n\n### Loading Multiple Pickled Objects\n\n```python\nimport pickle\n\n# Open the file in binary read mode\nwith open('my_objects.pkl', 'rb') as file:\n    try:\n        while True:\n            # Load each object until EOF is reached\n            obj = pickle.load(file)\n            print(obj)\n    except EOFError:\n        # End of file reached\n        pass\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Dumping**: You open the file in binary write mode (`'wb'`) and use `pickle.dump()` to write each object to the file. This appends each pickled object in sequence.\n\n2. **Loading**: You open the file in binary read mode (`'rb'`) and use a loop to load each object sequentially. The loop continues until an `EOFError` is raised, which indicates that you've reached the end of the file.\n\nThis approach is simple and effective for managing multiple pickled objects in a single file."
