        "content": "To capitalize the first letter of each word in a sentence using Python, you can use the `title()` method, which is a built-in string method. Here's a simple example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nsentence = \"this is a sample sentence.\"\ncapitalized_sentence = sentence.title()\nprint(capitalized_sentence)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nThis Is A Sample Sentence.\n```\n\nHowever, note that `title()` might not handle some edge cases as you might expect (e.g., it will also capitalize letters after certain punctuation marks like apostrophes). If you need more control, you can use a combination of `split()` and `capitalize()` methods:\n\n```python\nsentence = \"this is a sample sentence.\"\ncapitalized_sentence = ' '.join(word.capitalize() for word in sentence.split())\nprint(capitalized_sentence)\n```\n\nThis method will give you more precise control over how each word is capitalized, treating each space-separated segment as a word."
