        "content": "To disable autocompletion on a text field in Django, you can customize the widget used for that form field to include the `autocomplete=\"off\"` attribute. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using Forms in Django:**\n\n   If you are using Django forms, you can specify the widget for the particular field in your form class and set the `attrs` parameter to include `autocomplete=\"off\"`.\n\n   ```python\n   from django import forms\n   from .models import YourModel\n\n   class YourModelForm(forms.ModelForm):\n       class Meta:\n           model = YourModel\n           fields = ['credit_card_number']  # Add other fields as needed\n\n       credit_card_number = forms.CharField(\n           widget=forms.TextInput(attrs={'autocomplete': 'off'})\n       )\n   ```\n\n2. **Using ModelForm with Widgets:**\n\n   If you are using a `ModelForm`, you can also override the `__init__` method to set the widget attributes for specific fields:\n\n   ```python\n   from django import forms\n   from .models import YourModel\n\n   class YourModelForm(forms.ModelForm):\n       class Meta:\n           model = YourModel\n           fields = ['credit_card_number']  # Include other fields as needed\n\n       def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n           super(YourModelForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n           self.fields['credit_card_number'].widget.attrs.update({'autocomplete': 'off'})\n   ```\n\n3. **Directly in the Model (not recommended but possible):**\n\n   You can also define the widget directly in the model field, though this approach is less common and not recommended as it mixes form concerns with model definitions:\n\n   ```python\n   from django.db import models\n   from django.forms import TextInput\n\n   class YourModel(models.Model):\n       credit_card_number = models.CharField(max_length=16)\n\n       def formfield(self, **kwargs):\n           defaults = {'widget': TextInput(attrs={'autocomplete': 'off'})}\n           defaults.update(kwargs)\n           return super().formfield(**defaults)\n   ```\n\nThis way, you can disable the autocomplete feature on specific text fields in your Django forms without losing form validation."
