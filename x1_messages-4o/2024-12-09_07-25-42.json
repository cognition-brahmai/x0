My question is, where is this history stored?"

        "content": "IPython stores its history in a SQLite database file, not in a plain text file like `.pythonhistory`. This database is typically located in the IPython profile directory, which is often found under the user's home directory. The default location for this file on most systems is:\n\n```plaintext\n~/.ipython/profile_default/history.sqlite\n```\n\nHere's how you can locate this file:\n\n1. Check for the IPython directory in your home folder:\n   ```bash\n   ls ~/.ipython\n   ```\n\n2. Navigate to the `profile_default` directory:\n   ```bash\n   cd ~/.ipython/profile_default\n   ```\n\n3. Look for the `history.sqlite` file:\n   ```bash\n   ls\n   ```\n\nThe `history.sqlite` file is where IPython stores its command history. You can directly access this file using SQLite tools if you need to explore it manually, but generally, IPython takes care of managing it for command history retrieval within the IPython session."
