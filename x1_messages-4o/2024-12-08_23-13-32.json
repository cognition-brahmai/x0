Suddenly, the driver slams on the brakes and the car comes to a stop in 5 seconds.\nWhat is the force acting on the car to bring it to a stop?\nHint: Don't forget to take into account the car's momentum and the friction between the tires and the road."

        "content": "To find the force acting on the car to bring it to a stop, we can use the concept of deceleration and Newton's second law of motion. Here's how to calculate it:\n\n1. **Initial Momentum**: The initial velocity (\\(v_i\\)) of the car is 20 m/s, and the mass (\\(m\\)) is 1000 kg. So, the initial momentum (\\(p_i\\)) is given by:\n\n   \\[\n   p_i = m \\times v_i = 1000 \\, \\text{kg} \\times 20 \\, \\text{m/s} = 20000 \\, \\text{kg m/s}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Final Momentum**: The car comes to a stop, so the final velocity (\\(v_f\\)) is 0 m/s. Thus, the final momentum (\\(p_f\\)) is:\n\n   \\[\n   p_f = m \\times v_f = 1000 \\, \\text{kg} \\times 0 \\, \\text{m/s} = 0 \\, \\text{kg m/s}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Change in Momentum**: The change in momentum (\\(\\Delta p\\)) is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta p = p_f - p_i = 0 \\, \\text{kg m/s} - 20000 \\, \\text{kg m/s} = -20000 \\, \\text{kg m/s}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Impulse and Force**: Impulse is equal to the change in momentum and can also be expressed as the product of force (\\(F\\)) and time (\\(t\\)):\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta p = F \\times t\n   \\]\n\n   Solving for force:\n\n   \\[\n   F = \\frac{\\Delta p}{t} = \\frac{-20000 \\, \\text{kg m/s}}{5 \\, \\text{s}} = -4000 \\, \\text{N}\n   \\]\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the force is acting in the opposite direction of the car's initial motion, which is consistent with the car coming to a stop. Therefore, the force acting on the car to bring it to a stop is 4000 N in the direction opposite to the car's initial motion."
