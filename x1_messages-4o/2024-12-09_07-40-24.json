How can I implement this in my code?\n\nHere is the current code I am using:\n\n```python\nclass UserPasswordSerializer(ModelSerializer):\n\n    class Meta:\n        model = User\n        fields = [\n            'password'\n        ]\n\n        extra_kwargs = {\n            \"password\": {\"write_only\": True},\n        }\n\n    def update(self, instance, validated_data):\n        for attr, value in validated_data.items():\n            if attr == 'password':\n                instance.set_password(value)\n            else:\n                setattr(instance, attr, value)\n        instance.save()\n        return instance\n```"

        "content": "To modify your password update process to require the current password, you can update your `UserPasswordSerializer` to include an additional field for the current password. You'll also need to add validation to check if the current password is correct before allowing the update. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nfrom rest_framework import serializers\nfrom django.contrib.auth import authenticate\n\nclass UserPasswordSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):\n    current_password = serializers.CharField(write_only=True, required=True)\n    new_password = serializers.CharField(write_only=True, required=True)\n\n    class Meta:\n        model = User\n        fields = ['current_password', 'new_password']\n\n    def validate(self, attrs):\n        user = self.instance\n\n        # Check if the current password is correct\n        if not user.check_password(attrs.get('current_password')):\n            raise serializers.ValidationError({\"current_password\": \"Current password is incorrect.\"})\n\n        return attrs\n\n    def update(self, instance, validated_data):\n        # Extract the new password\n        new_password = validated_data.pop('new_password', None)\n\n        # Set the new password\n        if new_password:\n            instance.set_password(new_password)\n\n        instance.save()\n        return instance\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Fields**: We've added two fields, `current_password` and `new_password`, to handle the current and new passwords separately.\n\n2. **Validation**: A `validate` method is included to check if the provided `current_password` is correct using `user.check_password()`. If the current password is incorrect, it raises a `ValidationError`.\n\n3. **Update Method**: The `update` method now sets the password using the `new_password` field after validation is successful.\n\nMake sure to update your view to use this new serializer and handle the two password fields accordingly. This approach ensures that users must provide their current password before setting a new one, enhancing security."
