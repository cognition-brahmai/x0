When I run `nvidia-smi`, I receive the following error message: \"Failed to initialize NVML: Driver/library version mismatch\". I previously experienced the same problem and resolved it by uninstalling my CUDA library, which allowed me to run `nvidia-smi` successfully. However, after reinstalling CUDA by downloading `cuda-repo-ubuntu1604-8-0-local-ga2_8.0.61-1_amd64.deb` from the official NVIDIA page and running the following commands:\n\n```\nsudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1604-8-0-local-ga2_8.0.61-1_amd64.deb\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install cuda\nexport PATH=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}\n```\n\nI am now encountering the original mismatch error again. When I run `cat /proc/driver/nvidia/version`, I get:\n\n```\nNVRM version: NVIDIA UNIX x86_64 Kernel Module  378.13  Tue Feb  7 20:10:06 PST 2017\nGCC version:  gcc version 5.4.0 20160609 (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.4)\n```\n\nMy kernel release is 4.4.0-66-generic. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The \"driver/library version mismatch\" error typically occurs when the NVIDIA kernel module version and the user-space libraries are not in sync. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Remove Existing NVIDIA Drivers and CUDA:**\n\n   First, ensure that you completely remove any existing NVIDIA drivers and CUDA installations. You can do this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get --purge remove '*nvidia*'\n   sudo apt-get --purge remove '*cuda*'\n   sudo apt-get autoremove\n   ```\n\n2. **Reinstall the Latest NVIDIA Driver:**\n\n   Visit the [NVIDIA driver download page](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) and download the appropriate driver for your GPU and Ubuntu version. Follow the instructions on the page to install it.\n\n   Alternatively, you can use the following commands to install the driver from the Ubuntu repositories:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install nvidia-driver-<version>\n   ```\n\n   Make sure to replace `<version>` with the version number of the driver you want to install.\n\n3. **Reinstall CUDA:**\n\n   Once the NVIDIA driver is installed correctly, you can reinstall CUDA. Make sure to download the matching version of CUDA for your installed driver. You can use the same `.deb` file you previously downloaded, but ensure it is compatible with your driver version.\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1604-8-0-local-ga2_8.0.61-1_amd64.deb\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install cuda\n   ```\n\n4. **Check Environment Variables:**\n\n   Ensure that your environment variables are set correctly. Add the following lines to your `~/.bashrc` and then source it:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}\n   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}\n   ```\n\n   Apply the changes by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bashrc\n   ```\n\n5. **Reboot the System:**\n\n   After reinstalling the driver and CUDA, reboot your system to ensure that all changes are applied.\n\n6. **Verify Installation:**\n\n   After rebooting, verify your installation by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   nvidia-smi\n   ```\n\n   This command should now execute without errors, and you should see the details of your GPU and driver version.\n\nIf you still encounter issues, double-check compatibility between the driver and CUDA versions, and consult the NVIDIA forums or documentation for additional troubleshooting steps."
