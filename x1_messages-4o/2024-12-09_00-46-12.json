        "content": "The error message you're encountering, `OperationalError: (2003, \"Can't connect to MySQL server on 'localhost' (10061)\")`, indicates that your Python script is unable to connect to the MySQL server on your local machine. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure MySQL Server is Running:**\n   - Make sure that the MySQL server is running on your local machine. You can check this by opening the MySQL Workbench or another MySQL client and attempting to connect to the server.\n   - On Windows, you can check and start the MySQL service from the Services application. Look for a service named `MySQL` (or similar) and ensure it is running.\n\n2. **Check MySQL Server Port:**\n   - By default, MySQL runs on port 3306. Verify that the MySQL server is listening on this port.\n   - You can confirm the port by checking the MySQL configuration file (`my.cnf` or `my.ini`, depending on your operating system) for a line like `port=3306`.\n\n3. **Verify Host and Port in Code:**\n   - Double-check that the `host` parameter is set to `\"localhost\"` or `\"127.0.0.1\"` and that the port is correctly specified if it's different from the default.\n   - Example:\n     ```python\n     db = MySQLdb.connect(\n         host=\"localhost\",\n         port=3306,\n         user=\"br_admin\",\n         passwd=\"blabla\",\n         db=\"br_brain\"\n     )\n     ```\n\n4. **Check Firewall and Security Settings:**\n   - Ensure that no firewall or security settings are blocking connections to the MySQL server on your local machine. You may need to adjust firewall settings to allow traffic on the MySQL port (3306).\n\n5. **Verify Credentials:**\n   - Double-check that the username, password, and database name you're using in the `MySQLdb.connect` call are correct.\n   - Try connecting with these credentials using another MySQL client to ensure they are valid.\n\n6. **Check for Socket Configuration (For Unix/Linux):**\n   - If you're on a Unix/Linux system, ensure that the MySQL server is using the correct socket file. Sometimes, specifying the `unix_socket` parameter can resolve connection issues:\n     ```python\n     db = MySQLdb.connect(\n         host=\"localhost\",\n         user=\"br_admin\",\n         passwd=\"blabla\",\n         db=\"br_brain\",\n         unix_socket=\"/path/to/mysql.sock\"\n     )\n     ```\n\n7. **Review MySQL Server Logs:**\n   - Check the MySQL server logs for any error messages or clues about why the connection is failing.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the connection issue with your MySQL server. If the problem persists, consider restarting your server or reinstalling MySQL to ensure it is properly configured."
