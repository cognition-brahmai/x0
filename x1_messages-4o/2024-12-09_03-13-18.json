        "content": "Is there a method to control the parallel execution of tests in pytest-xdist? I have a directory layout as follows:\n\n<pre><code>runner.py\nlib/\ntests/\n      testsuite1/\n                 testsuite1.py\n      testsuite2/\n                 testsuite2.py\n      testsuite3/\n                 testsuite3.py\n      testsuite4/\n                 testsuite4.py\n</code></pre>\n\nThe structure of my `testsuitex.py` modules is:\n\n<pre>\nimport pytest \nclass testsomething:\n      def setup_class(self):\n          ''' do some setup '''\n          # Do some setup stuff here      \n      def teardown_class(self):\n          '''' do some teardown'''\n          # Do some teardown stuff here\n\n      def test1(self):\n          # Do some test1 related stuff\n\n      def test2(self):\n          # Do some test2 related stuff\n\n      ....\n      ....\n      ....\n      def test40(self):\n          # Do some test40 related stuff\n\nif __name__=='__main()__'\n   pytest.main(args=[os.path.abspath(__file__)])\n</pre>\n\nI want to execute the 'testsuites' in parallel, but I want the individual tests within the testsuites to be executed serially. When I use the 'xdist' plugin from py.test and kick off the tests using 'py.test -n 4', py.test gathers all the tests and randomly balances the tests among 4 workers. This leads to the 'setup_class' method being executed each time for each test within a 'testsuitex.py' module. I want `setup_class` to be executed only once per class and tests executed serially. \n\nSo, I need:\n\n<pre>\nworker1: executes all tests in testsuite1.py serially\nworker2: executes all tests in testsuite2.py serially\nworker3: executes all tests in testsuite3.py serially\nworker4: executes all tests in testsuite4.py serially\n</pre>\n\nwith all workers running in parallel. Can this be achieved in the 'pytest-xdist' framework? The only solution I can think of is to kick off different processes to execute each test suite individually within `runner.py`:\n\n<pre>\n\ndef test_execute_func(testsuite_path):\n    subprocess.process('py.test %s' % testsuite_path)\n\nif __name__=='__main__':\n   #Gather all the testsuite names\n   for each testsuite:\n       multiprocessing.Process(test_execute_func,(testsuite_path,))\n</pre>"

        "content": "To achieve what you're aiming for using `pytest-xdist`, you can use the `--dist=loadscope` option. This option will distribute tests based on the scope of the test class or test module, which aligns with your requirement to run all tests within a test suite serially on a single worker.\n\nHere's how you can set this up:\n\n1. **Install `pytest-xdist`**: Ensure you have `pytest-xdist` installed in your environment. You can install it using pip if you haven't done so already:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pytest-xdist\n   ```\n\n2. **Use `--dist=loadscope`**: When running your tests with `pytest`, specify the `--dist=loadscope` option along with `-n` to indicate the number of workers. This will ensure that all tests in a single class or module are executed by the same worker, thus respecting the `setup_class` and `teardown_class` methods.\n\n   ```bash\n   pytest -n 4 --dist=loadscope\n   ```\n\nThis configuration will ensure that:\n\n- Worker 1 runs all tests in `testsuite1.py` serially.\n- Worker 2 runs all tests in `testsuite2.py` serially.\n- Worker 3 runs all tests in `testsuite3.py` serially.\n- Worker 4 runs all tests in `testsuite4.py` serially.\n\n### Alternative Approach\n\nIf you still encounter issues or need more control, your idea of using separate processes is a valid alternative. Here's an enhanced version of your approach:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport multiprocessing\nimport subprocess\n\ndef test_execute_func(testsuite_path):\n    subprocess.run(['pytest', testsuite_path])\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Define the paths to your test suites\n    test_suites = [\n        'tests/testsuite1/testsuite1.py',\n        'tests/testsuite2/testsuite2.py',\n        'tests/testsuite3/testsuite3.py',\n        'tests/testsuite4/testsuite4.py',\n    ]\n\n    # Create a process for each test suite\n    processes = []\n    for suite in test_suites:\n        process = multiprocessing.Process(target=test_execute_func, args=(suite,))\n        processes.append(process)\n        process.start()\n\n    # Wait for all processes to complete\n    for process in processes:\n        process.join()\n```\n\nThis script will start a new process for each test suite, which will run them in parallel while ensuring that all tests within a suite run serially."
