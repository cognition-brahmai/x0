The output is of type 'numpy.matrixlib.defmatrix.matrix', for example: [[ 0.16666667 0.66666667 0.16666667]]. I need to convert this to a list so that I can loop through it later for calculating the Pearson distance between two such lists."

        "content": "To convert a 1x3 numpy matrix to a list, you can use the `tolist()` method provided by NumPy. This method converts a NumPy array or matrix to a nested list in Python. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Example of a 1x3 numpy.matrix\nmatrix_result = np.matrix([[0.16666667, 0.66666667, 0.16666667]])\n\n# Convert to list\nlist_result = matrix_result.tolist()[0]\n\n# Now you can loop through the list\nfor value in list_result:\n    print(value)\n```\n\nIn this example, `matrix_result.tolist()` converts the matrix to a list of lists (since it's a 2D structure), and `[0]` is used to access the first (and only) sublist, effectively giving you a flat list. Now you can easily loop through `list_result` to calculate the Pearson distance or perform any other operations you need."
