I need to carry out a sequence of actions including doing a POST with a few parameters and headers, following a redirect and retrieving the HTML body. I am new to Python and my attempts using httplib, urllib and urllib2 have not been successful. With httplib, I used putrequest() (passing the parameters within the URL), and putheader() but it did not seem to follow the redirects. When using urllib and urllib2, passing both headers and parameters as dictionaries, it returned the login page instead of the page I was trying to login to, possibly due to lack of cookies. Can you guide me on what I might be missing or the correct way to do this?"

        "content": "To automate the login sequence of a web application using Python, it's often more convenient to use the `requests` library, which simplifies handling POST requests, managing sessions, and following redirects. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieving this:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide\n\n1. **Install the `requests` library**:\n   If you haven't installed the `requests` library, you can do so via pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a session**:\n   Using a session helps in persisting cookies across requests, which is generally required for maintaining a login session.\n\n3. **Perform the POST request with login data**:\n   Use the session to send a POST request with the necessary login credentials and headers.\n\n4. **Handle redirects and retrieve the HTML**:\n   The `requests` library will automatically handle redirects for you, so you can directly access the content after the login attempt.\n\nHere's an example script that demonstrates this process:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Define the login URL and the URL you want to reach after login\nlogin_url = 'https://example.com/login'\ntarget_url = 'https://example.com/dashboard'\n\n# Create a session object\nsession = requests.Session()\n\n# Define your login parameters and headers\nlogin_data = {\n    'username': 'your_username',\n    'password': 'your_password'\n}\n\nheaders = {\n    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3'\n}\n\n# Perform the login POST request\nresponse = session.post(login_url, data=login_data, headers=headers)\n\n# Check if login was successful\nif response.ok:\n    print(\"Login successful!\")\n\n    # Now, access the target page\n    target_response = session.get(target_url)\n\n    # Check if the target page was successfully retrieved\n    if target_response.ok:\n        print(\"Retrieved target page successfully!\")\n        # Print the HTML content of the target page\n        print(target_response.text)\n    else:\n        print(\"Failed to retrieve target page.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Login failed.\")\n\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Session Management**: By using `requests.Session()`, you maintain a persistent session, which automatically handles cookies and headers across requests.\n- **Automatic Redirects**: The `requests` library automatically follows redirects after login, simplifying the process.\n- **Headers and User-Agent**: Setting a `User-Agent` header can help mimic a real browser and may be required by some servers to avoid blocking automated scripts.\n- **Debugging**: If the login fails, inspect the `response` to check for issues like incorrect credentials or missing headers.\n\nIf you encounter any problems or need further customization (e.g., handling CSRF tokens), please provide additional details about the login process, and I can help you adjust the script accordingly."
