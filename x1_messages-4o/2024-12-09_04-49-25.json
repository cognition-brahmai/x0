        "content": "In Python's `unittest.TestCase`, `assertEquals` and `assertEqual` are essentially the same function; there is no functional difference between them. The existence of both is primarily for convenience and historical reasons.\n\n- **`assertEqual`** is the preferred and more commonly used method name in recent versions of Python. It is consistent with the naming conventions of other assertion methods in the `unittest` module, like `assertNotEqual`, `assertTrue`, `assertFalse`, etc.\n\n- **`assertEquals`** is an older alias that exists for backward compatibility. In earlier versions of Python's `unittest` framework, `assertEquals` was more commonly used. To maintain compatibility with older test code and reduce the need for refactoring, `assertEquals` is still available as an alias for `assertEqual`.\n\nIn summary, you can use either method, but it's generally recommended to use `assertEqual` to align with the current naming conventions and for consistency with other assertion methods in the `unittest` module."
