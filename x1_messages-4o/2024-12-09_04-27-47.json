However, I'm encountering a TypeError: get() takes no keyword arguments when I try to use the get() method with a default value like this: `converted_comments[submission.id] = converted_comments.get(submission.id, default=0)`. According to the documentation and various tutorials, the get() method does take a default argument. What could be the issue here?"

        "content": "It looks like you might have a misunderstanding or a typo regarding the usage of the `get()` method in Python dictionaries. The `get()` method indeed takes two arguments: the key you want to retrieve and an optional default value that is returned if the key is not found. However, the syntax you provided seems correct at first glance, and the error message you received suggests there might be more to it.\n\nHere's a typical usage of `get()`:\n\n```python\nconverted_comments[submission.id] = converted_comments.get(submission.id, [])\n```\n\nIn this example, `converted_comments.get(submission.id, [])` will return the value associated with `submission.id` if it exists; otherwise, it will return an empty list `[]`.\n\nIf you're encountering a `TypeError` with the message `get() takes no keyword arguments`, it's possible that:\n1. `converted_comments` is not a dictionary. If it\u2019s an instance of a custom class or another data structure that redefines `get()`, it might not support the same arguments as Python's built-in dictionary `get()`.\n2. There's a typo elsewhere in your code affecting the function's behavior.\n\nTo resolve this, ensure that `converted_comments` is indeed a dictionary. You can confirm this by checking its type:\n\n```python\nprint(type(converted_comments))\n```\n\nIf it's not a dictionary, you need to adjust your data structure to be a dictionary or use the appropriate method offered by your data structure to achieve similar functionality.\n\nIf `converted_comments` is a dictionary and you're still facing issues, double-check that there's no other code that might be overriding the dictionary's `get()` method or affecting its behavior."
