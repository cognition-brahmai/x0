I have installed pytesseract and Tesseract on my system, yet the issue persists. The error message I receive is as follows: \"pytesseract.pytesseract.TesseractNotFoundError: tesseract is not installed or it's not in your path\". This issue arises when I run the following code: \n\n```python\nimport cv2\nimport pytesseract\n\nimg = cv2.imread('1d.png')\nprint(pytesseract.image_to_string(img))\n```\n\nHow can I resolve this TesseractNotFoundError?"

        "content": "The `TesseractNotFoundError` typically indicates that Python can't find the Tesseract executable, either because it's not installed correctly or because its path is not included in the system's PATH environment variable. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify Tesseract Installation:**\n   - Ensure that Tesseract OCR is properly installed on your system. You can download it from [this link for Windows](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) or use your Linux package manager (e.g., `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr` on Ubuntu).\n\n2. **Add Tesseract to PATH:**\n   - On Windows:\n     - Find where Tesseract is installed (usually something like `C:\\Program Files\\Tesseract-OCR`).\n     - Add the installation path to your system's PATH environment variable:\n       - Right-click on 'This PC' or 'My Computer' and select 'Properties'.\n       - Click on 'Advanced system settings'.\n       - Click on 'Environment Variables'.\n       - Under 'System variables', find the PATH variable and click 'Edit'.\n       - Add the path to the directory where `tesseract.exe` is located.\n     - Restart your command prompt or IDE to ensure the changes take effect.\n\n   - On Linux:\n     - Run `which tesseract` to find the installation path. If it's not found, you may need to install it using your package manager.\n     - Ensure that the path to the Tesseract executable is included in your `PATH` environment variable. You can add it by editing your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` file:\n       ```bash\n       export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin\n       ```\n     - Reload the file by running `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.bash_profile`.\n\n3. **Specify Tesseract Path in Code:**\n   - As an alternative or additional step, you can explicitly specify the path to the Tesseract executable in your Python code:\n     ```python\n     import cv2\n     import pytesseract\n\n     # Specify the path to tesseract executable\n     pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\\Program Files\\Tesseract-OCR\\tesseract.exe'  # Adjust this path as needed\n\n     img = cv2.imread('1d.png')\n     print(pytesseract.image_to_string(img))\n     ```\n\n4. **Check Python Environment:**\n   - Make sure that you are using the correct Python environment where `pytesseract` is installed. Sometimes, issues arise from using a different Python interpreter than the one where the package is installed.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `TesseractNotFoundError` and successfully use `pytesseract` to perform OCR on your images."
