        "content": "To utilize a GPU from inside a Docker container without using privileged mode, you can leverage NVIDIA's container toolkit. This approach allows you to run GPU-accelerated applications in Docker containers efficiently. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. **Install NVIDIA Drivers**: Ensure that the NVIDIA drivers are installed on your host system. You can verify this by running `nvidia-smi` and checking its output.\n\n2. **Install Docker**: Make sure that Docker is installed and running on your system.\n\n3. **Install NVIDIA Container Toolkit**: You need to install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit to enable GPU support in Docker.\n\n### Installation Steps\n\n1. **Add NVIDIA Package Repository**:\n\n   ```bash\n   distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID)\n   curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -\n   curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list\n   ```\n\n2. **Install NVIDIA Container Toolkit**:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-docker2\n   ```\n\n3. **Restart Docker**:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo systemctl restart docker\n   ```\n\n### Running a Container with GPU Support\n\nNow that the NVIDIA Container Toolkit is set up, you can run containers with GPU support using the `--gpus` flag.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --gpus all nvidia/cuda:11.0-base nvidia-smi\n```\n\nThis command pulls the `nvidia/cuda` image and runs `nvidia-smi` inside the Docker container to display the GPU status. The `--gpus all` flag specifies that all available GPUs should be accessible to the container.\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- **Specific GPUs**: If you want to use specific GPUs, you can specify them using indices. For example, to use GPU 0 and 1, you can use `--gpus '\"device=0,1\"'`.\n\n- **Memory and Compute Capability**: You can also limit the GPU resources by specifying memory or compute capability constraints.\n\n- **Docker Compose**: If you are using Docker Compose, you can add GPU support by specifying the `runtime` in your `docker-compose.yml` file:\n\n  ```yaml\n  version: '3.8'\n  services:\n    my_service:\n      image: nvidia/cuda:11.0-base\n      deploy:\n        resources:\n          reservations:\n            devices:\n              - capabilities: [gpu]\n  ```\n\nBy using NVIDIA's container toolkit, you can effectively manage GPU resources without needing to run containers in privileged mode."
