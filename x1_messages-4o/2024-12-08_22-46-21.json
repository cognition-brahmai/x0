However, the catch is that the output should only display the user's name if their age is a multiple of 3. Otherwise, the output should display their age multiplied by 2. Can you crack this puzzle and provide me with the sample code?"

Here's a sample C++ code that fulfills the requirements of your puzzle:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n\nint main() {\n    std::string name;\n    int age;\n\n    // Prompt the user for their name\n    std::cout << \"Enter your name: \";\n    std::getline(std::cin, name);\n\n    // Prompt the user for their age\n    std::cout << \"Enter your age: \";\n    std::cin >> age;\n\n    // Check if the age is a multiple of 3\n    if (age % 3 == 0) {\n        // Display the user's name\n        std::cout << \"Your name is: \" << name << std::endl;\n    } else {\n        // Display the age multiplied by 2\n        std::cout << \"Your age multiplied by 2 is: \" << age * 2 << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis code will prompt the user to input their name and age. If the user's age is a multiple of 3, it will display their name. Otherwise, it will display the user's age multiplied by 2."
