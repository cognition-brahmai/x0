        "content": "To rewrite the equation \\(5 \\times 3 \\div 2 = 7.5\\) using only addition and subtraction operators, we need to express the multiplication and division in terms of repeated addition and subtraction.\n\n1. **Multiplication as Addition:**\n   - \\(5 \\times 3\\) can be expressed as adding 5 three times:\n     \\[\n     5 + 5 + 5 = 15\n     \\]\n\n2. **Division as Subtraction:**\n   - \\(15 \\div 2\\) can be interpreted as finding how many times 2 can be subtracted from 15 until you reach the remainder that gives you 7.5:\n     \\[\n     15 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 = 1\n     \\]\n   - The remainder is 1, and you need to divide that further to get the equivalent of 0.5 to reach 7.5.\n\nNow, let's express this using addition and subtraction only. One approach is to approximate the process:\n\n- \\(15\\) is the result of the addition of \\(5\\) three times.\n- To get to \\(7.5\\), we need half of \\(15\\), which is \\(7.5\\).\n\nTherefore, the equivalent equation using only addition and subtraction can be written as:\n\\[\n15 - 7.5 = 7.5\n\\]\n\nRealistically, the operation \\(7.5\\) itself is based on understanding division as a repeated subtraction or division by 2 as halving. For a purely theoretical conversion using only addition and subtraction, you would illustrate the operation as balancing repeated subtractions, leading to:\n\\[\n(5 + 5 + 5) - (5 + 5 + 2.5) = 7.5\n\\]\n\nThis setup keeps the idea of halving embedded in the subtraction context."
