My aim is to pass a string and a Time To Live (TTL) to a cache, and then fetch all the strings that are in the cache as a list. The cache will be in-memory and the TTL will not exceed 20 seconds. Could anyone suggest a way to accomplish this?"

        "content": "To achieve thread communication with a TTL-based cache in Python, you can use the `threading` module along with a custom in-memory cache that uses a dictionary to store the strings with their respective TTLs. You can use the `time` module to manage the TTLs effectively. Below is an example implementation:\n\n```python\nimport threading\nimport time\n\nclass TTLCache:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.lock = threading.Lock()\n        self.cache = {}\n    \n    def add(self, key, ttl):\n        with self.lock:\n            expiration_time = time.time() + ttl\n            self.cache[key] = expiration_time\n            # Start a thread to remove the key after TTL expires\n            threading.Thread(target=self._remove_after_ttl, args=(key, ttl)).start()\n    \n    def _remove_after_ttl(self, key, ttl):\n        time.sleep(ttl)\n        with self.lock:\n            if key in self.cache and self.cache[key] <= time.time():\n                del self.cache[key]\n    \n    def get_keys(self):\n        with self.lock:\n            current_time = time.time()\n            # Return only those keys which are still valid\n            return [key for key, expiry in self.cache.items() if expiry > current_time]\n\n# Example usage\ncache = TTLCache()\n\ndef thread_function(name):\n    # Example string and TTL\n    string = f\"Thread-{name}\"\n    ttl = 5  # TTL in seconds\n    \n    # Add string to cache\n    cache.add(string, ttl)\n    print(f\"Added: {string} with TTL: {ttl}s\")\n    \n    # Simulating some work\n    time.sleep(2)\n    \n    # Fetch all valid strings from cache\n    valid_keys = cache.get_keys()\n    print(f\"Thread-{name} sees valid keys: {valid_keys}\")\n\n# Create multiple threads\nthreads = []\nfor i in range(5):\n    t = threading.Thread(target=thread_function, args=(i,))\n    threads.append(t)\n    t.start()\n\n# Wait for all threads to complete\nfor t in threads:\n    t.join()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **TTLCache Class**: This class manages the in-memory cache with TTL functionality.\n   - `add`: Adds a new string to the cache with a TTL.\n   - `_remove_after_ttl`: A background thread function that removes the string from the cache once the TTL expires.\n   - `get_keys`: Retrieves all strings currently in the cache whose TTL has not expired.\n\n2. **Thread Management**:\n   - Each thread adds a string to the cache with a specific TTL.\n   - After doing some simulated work (`time.sleep(2)`), each thread retrieves and prints the current valid keys from the cache.\n\n3. **Thread Safety**:\n   - A lock (`self.lock`) is used to ensure that access to the shared cache is thread-safe.\n\nThis design allows you to manage in-memory communication between threads using a TTL-based cache. Adjust the TTL and the number of threads as needed for your specific use case."
