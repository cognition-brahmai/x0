I've learned that the numpy 1.8 version introduced `np.nanmean` which can ignore `nan` values, but when the array only contains `nan` values, it raises a warning: \"Mean of empty slice\". Is there a better function or method I can use to get the behaviour of `nanmean` without this warning? I don't like suppressing warnings."

        "content": "When dealing with NumPy arrays that may contain NaN values, `np.nanmean` is typically a good choice because it computes the mean while ignoring NaNs. However, as you've noticed, it raises a warning when the array contains only NaNs, since the non-NaN slice is effectively empty.\n\nIf you want to avoid this warning without suppressing it, you can create a custom function that checks for this condition before calling `np.nanmean`. Here's a way to do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef safe_nanmean(arr):\n    # Check if all values in the array are NaN\n    if np.all(np.isnan(arr)):\n        return np.nan  # or any other value you prefer, such as None or a specific message\n    else:\n        return np.nanmean(arr)\n\na = np.array([np.NaN, np.NaN])\nb = np.array([np.NaN, np.NaN, 3])\n\nmean_a = safe_nanmean(a)\nmean_b = safe_nanmean(b)\n\nprint(\"Mean of array a:\", mean_a)\nprint(\"Mean of array b:\", mean_b)\n```\n\nThis `safe_nanmean` function first checks if all elements in the array are NaN using `np.all(np.isnan(arr))`. If that's the case, it directly returns `np.nan` (or another value of your choice) without calling `np.nanmean`, thus avoiding the warning. Otherwise, it calls `np.nanmean` to compute the mean while ignoring NaNs."
