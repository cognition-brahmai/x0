You only need to replace each backslash with an empty string to effectively remove them. Here\u2019s how you can do it correctly:\n\n```python\nresult = result.replace(\"\\\\\", \"\")\n```\n\nThis code will replace every backslash (`\\`) in the string with an empty string, effectively removing all backslashes from `result`.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to treat `result` as a raw string in this case because the `replace` method works with regular strings, and the backslash is correctly identified in the string as is. Just ensure that `result` is properly initialized and contains the string you want to process."
