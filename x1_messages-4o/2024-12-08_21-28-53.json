        "content": "Quicksort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that utilizes a divide-and-conquer strategy to sort elements in an array or list. Here's a summary of how it operates:\n\n1. **Choose a Pivot**: Select an element from the array as the \"pivot\". This can be the first element, the last element, the middle element, or even a random element, depending on the implementation.\n\n2. **Partitioning**: Rearrange the elements in the array so that all elements less than the pivot are on its left, and all elements greater than the pivot are on its right. This results in the pivot being in its final sorted position. The partitioning can be done using various strategies, with the Lomuto and Hoare partition schemes being the most common.\n\n3. **Recursive Sorting**: Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-arrays of elements with smaller values and the sub-arrays of elements with greater values. The base case for the recursion is an array of zero or one element, which is already sorted.\n\n4. **Combine**: Since the array is sorted in place, no additional work is required to combine the sub-arrays. Once the recursion completes, the array is fully sorted.\n\nQuicksort is known for its average-case time complexity of O(n log n), but it can degrade to O(n\u00b2) in the worst case, particularly when the chosen pivot elements are consistently the smallest or largest. However, with good pivot selection strategies (like using the median-of-three rule or randomization), the worst-case scenario can be mitigated, making quicksort a preferred choice for sorting large datasets."
