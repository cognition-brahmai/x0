I am trying to plot the time series of each of the 6 variants (3 strategies * 2 trading costs) on the same axes, using Matplotlib. I want the lines representing \"with transaction cost\" to be plotted with `alpha=1` and `linewidth=1`, while the lines for \"no transaction costs\" to be plotted with `alpha=0.25` and `linewidth=5`. However, I want the color to be the same for both versions of each strategy. I am trying to reset the color cycle in Matplotlib after the first loop so that it starts again for the second loop. Can anyone tell me what code I should use to achieve this? Here is the code that I have so far:\n\n```python\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(10, 10))\n\nfor c in with_transaction_frame.columns:\n    ax.plot(with_transaction_frame[c], label=c, alpha=1, linewidth=1)\n\n# NEED TO RESET THE COLOR CYCLE HERE\n\nfor c in no_transaction_frame.columns:\n    ax.plot(no_transaction_frame[c], label=c, alpha=0.25, linewidth=5)\n\nax.legend()\n```"

        "content": "To achieve the desired effect of using the same color for each strategy while having different alpha and linewidth settings for \"with transaction cost\" and \"no transaction cost\", you need to reset the color cycle of Matplotlib between the two loops. You can do this by using the `cycler` module from `matplotlib` to explicitly set the color cycle. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import cycler\n\n# Define a color cycle\ncolor_cycle = cycler(color=plt.cm.tab10.colors)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(10, 10))\n\n# Set the color cycle for the first loop\nax.set_prop_cycle(color_cycle)\n\nfor c in with_transaction_frame.columns:\n    ax.plot(with_transaction_frame[c], label=f\"{c} with cost\", alpha=1, linewidth=1)\n\n# Reset the color cycle for the second loop\nax.set_prop_cycle(color_cycle)\n\nfor c in no_transaction_frame.columns:\n    ax.plot(no_transaction_frame[c], label=f\"{c} no cost\", alpha=0.25, linewidth=5)\n\nax.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the changes:\n\n1. **Color Cycle**: I used `plt.cm.tab10.colors` to define a color cycle. This gives you a set of distinct colors that are commonly used for plotting.\n\n2. **Set Property Cycle**: Before each loop, `ax.set_prop_cycle(color_cycle)` is used to set the same color cycle. This ensures that both loops use the same set of colors.\n\n3. **Labeling**: I slightly modified the labels to distinguish between \"with cost\" and \"no cost\" in the legend.\n\nThese changes should help you plot both sets of series with the same colors, but different alpha and linewidth as specified."
