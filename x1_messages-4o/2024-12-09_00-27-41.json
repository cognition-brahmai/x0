I have a class 'DataHolder' and my 'rst' file is set up, but Sphinx is not connecting the 'Attributes' section with the real attributes, hence not displaying their default value. I also have sphinx extensions 'sphinx.ext.viewcode', 'sphinx.ext.autodoc', and 'sphinxcontrib.napoleon' enabled. How can I achieve this as I am unable to find good examples for this use case?"

        "content": "To auto-generate documentation for your code, including attributes with their default values and types, using Sphinx with docstrings, follow these steps. It seems like you're almost there, but need a bit of tweaking to connect your attributes properly. Let's ensure your setup is correct and suggest some additional configurations:\n\n1. **Ensure Correct Docstring Format**: Make sure your class and attributes are documented correctly in your docstrings using the Google style or NumPy style, which `sphinxcontrib.napoleon` can parse. Here's an example for your `DataHolder` class:\n\n    ```python\n    class DataHolder:\n        \"\"\"\n        DataHolder class for storing and managing data.\n\n        Attributes:\n            attribute1 (int): Description of attribute1. Defaults to 0.\n            attribute2 (str): Description of attribute2. Defaults to 'default'.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        def __init__(self, attribute1: int = 0, attribute2: str = 'default'):\n            self.attribute1 = attribute1\n            self.attribute2 = attribute2\n    ```\n\n2. **Check Your `conf.py`**: Ensure your `conf.py` is set up correctly to use the Napoleon extension and is configured to show type hints. Here's a snippet:\n\n    ```python\n    extensions = [\n        'sphinx.ext.viewcode',\n        'sphinx.ext.autodoc',\n        'sphinxcontrib.napoleon',\n    ]\n\n    napoleon_google_docstring = True\n    napoleon_numpy_docstring = True\n    napoleon_include_init_with_doc = True\n    napoleon_include_private_with_doc = False\n    napoleon_include_special_with_doc = True\n    napoleon_use_admonition_for_examples = False\n    napoleon_use_admonition_for_notes = False\n    napoleon_use_admonition_for_references = False\n    napoleon_use_ivar = False\n    napoleon_use_param = True\n    napoleon_use_rtype = True\n\n    autodoc_typehints = 'description'\n    ```\n\n3. **Use the `autodoc` Directive**: In your `.rst` file, make sure you're using the `autoclass` directive to document your class, and set the `:members:` option to include attributes:\n\n    ```rst\n    .. autoclass:: your_module.DataHolder\n        :members:\n        :undoc-members:\n        :show-inheritance:\n    ```\n\n4. **Check for `autodoc` Plugins**: Ensure that the `autodoc` plugin is correctly parsing the attributes. By default, `sphinx.ext.autodoc` should handle this, but if you have specific needs, consider using `sphinx-autodoc-typehints` for better handling of type annotations.\n\n5. **Build the Documentation**: Make sure to clean the previous builds and rebuild your documentation:\n\n    ```bash\n    make clean\n    make html\n    ```\n\nBy following these steps, Sphinx should correctly auto-generate the documentation for your `DataHolder` class, including attributes with their default values and type annotations. If issues persist, check the console output for errors during the build process, as they might provide clues on what's going wrong."
