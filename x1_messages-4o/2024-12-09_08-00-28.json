For instance, if I have a list of regex patterns such as `[regex1, regex2, regex3]`, how can I check if a line matches any of these patterns? Currently, I am utilising `re.findall(regex1, line)` but it only matches one regex at a time."

        "content": "Yes, you can determine if a line contains words that match a set of regular expression patterns by iterating over each regex pattern and checking if any of them match the line. You can use the `re.search()` function, which returns a match object if the pattern is found in the string, or `None` if the pattern is not found.\n\nHere's a way to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# List of regex patterns\nregex_patterns = [r'regex1', r'regex2', r'regex3']\n\n# The line you want to check\nline = \"Your text here\"\n\n# Function to check if the line matches any pattern\ndef matches_any_pattern(line, patterns):\n    for pattern in patterns:\n        if re.search(pattern, line):\n            return True\n    return False\n\n# Check if the line matches any of the patterns\nif matches_any_pattern(line, regex_patterns):\n    print(\"The line matches at least one of the patterns.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The line does not match any of the patterns.\")\n```\n\nThis function `matches_any_pattern` iterates through each regex pattern in the list and uses `re.search()` to check if the pattern is found within the line. If a match is found, it returns `True` immediately. If none of the patterns match, it returns `False` after the loop completes."
