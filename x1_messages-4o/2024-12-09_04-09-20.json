I have tried finding out why Python does not have a formal implementation of multiline comments similar to the /* */ type of comments in other programming languages, but I haven't found a technical answer. I don't have a problem using triple quotes, but I am curious about the reasoning behind this design decision. Can someone explain why Python doesn't have multiline comments?"

        "content": "In Python, the decision to not have a formal implementation of multiline comments similar to `/* */` in languages like C or Java is rooted in Python's design philosophy, which emphasizes simplicity and readability. Here are some reasons why Python does not have dedicated syntax for multiline comments:\n\n1. **Simplicity and Clarity**: Python's syntax is designed to be simple and clear. Introducing a separate syntax for multiline comments could add unnecessary complexity to the language. Instead, Python encourages the use of multiple single-line comments (using `#`) for clarity and simplicity.\n\n2. **Readability**: Python emphasizes readability, and using single-line comments encourages developers to write concise and readable code. Each line starting with `#` indicates a comment, making the intention clear.\n\n3. **Docstrings**: Triple-quoted strings are not comments but are used for documentation purposes, known as docstrings. They serve a dual purpose: they can be used for documentation within functions, classes, and modules, and can also be used temporarily as \"comments\" during development. However, they remain part of the code as string literals.\n\n4. **Tooling and Convention**: The Python community and tooling (like linters and IDEs) are built around the convention of using `#` for comments. This consistent approach aids in maintaining code readability and consistency across Python projects.\n\n5. **Minimalistic Language Design**: Python's design philosophy includes having one\u2014and preferably only one\u2014obvious way to do things. By using `#` for comments, Python maintains a minimal set of syntax elements, which aligns with this philosophy.\n\nWhile triple-quoted strings can be used to comment out blocks of code temporarily, they are not technically comments. They are string literals that are not assigned to any variable, so they don't affect the program's execution but are still considered part of the code. This usage is more of a workaround than an intended feature for comments.\n\nOverall, the use of single-line comments (`#`) aligns with Python's goal of maintaining simplicity and clarity in the language's syntax."
