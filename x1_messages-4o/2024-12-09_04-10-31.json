        "content": "The `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets'` error indicates that the `QtWebEngineWidgets` module is not available in your current PyQt5 installation. This module is part of the PyQtWebEngine package, which is separate from the main PyQt5 package. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Install PyQtWebEngine**: You need to install the `PyQtWebEngine` package to use `QtWebEngineWidgets`. You can do this using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install PyQtWebEngine\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify Installation**: After installing, verify that the `PyQtWebEngine` is correctly installed by running the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip show PyQtWebEngine\n   ```\n\n   This should display information about the package, confirming that it's installed.\n\n3. **Check Python Environment**: Ensure that the Python environment in which you're running your script is the same one where you've installed the `PyQtWebEngine`. You can check the paths using:\n\n   ```bash\n   which python  # On macOS/Linux\n   where python  # On Windows\n   ```\n\n   Also, make sure that Eclipse is configured to use the correct Python interpreter. You can check or change the interpreter settings in Eclipse under `Window` > `Preferences` > `PyDev` > `Interpreters`.\n\n4. **Eclipse Configuration**: Double-check your Eclipse setup to ensure that the Python interpreter used is the one where `PyQtWebEngine` is installed. If you're using a virtual environment, make sure it's activated before running your script.\n\n5. **Code Adjustment**: Ensure your import statements are correct and reflect your installed modules. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   from PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets import QWebEngineView\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError` and successfully run your PyQt5 application with web engine support in Eclipse."
