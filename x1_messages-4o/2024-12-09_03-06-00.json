        "content": "To automatically change colors in a `for` loop while plotting points using Matplotlib, you can utilize a color map or a predefined list of colors. Here's how you can do it with both methods:\n\n### Method 1: Using a Colormap\n\nMatplotlib provides a variety of colormaps that you can use to cycle through colors. Here's an example using the `viridis` colormap:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Sample data\nx = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)\ny = np.sin(x)\n\n# Get a colormap\ncmap = plt.get_cmap('viridis')\n\n# Plot with changing colors\nfor i in range(5):\n    plt.plot(x, y + i, color=cmap(i / 4))  # Normalize i by dividing by the max index\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using a Predefined List of Colors\n\nYou can also define a list of colors and cycle through them:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Sample data\nx = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)\ny = np.sin(x)\n\n# Define a list of colors\ncolors = ['r', 'g', 'b', 'c', 'm']\n\n# Plot with changing colors\nfor i in range(5):\n    plt.plot(x, y + i, color=colors[i % len(colors)])  # Cycle through the color list\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nBoth methods will allow you to automatically change colors for each iteration in your loop. The colormap approach is more flexible for a larger number of plots, while the predefined list is straightforward for a smaller set of distinct colors."
