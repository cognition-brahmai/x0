        "content": "Creating a simulation of the water cycle, including evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and groundwater flow, can be a complex task. However, we can simplify it using Scala to create a basic model that represents these processes. Here's how you might go about it:\n\n```scala\nobject WaterCycleSimulation {\n\n  case class WaterState(evaporated: Double, condensed: Double, precipitated: Double, groundwater: Double)\n\n  def evaporation(waterBody: Double, evaporationRate: Double): Double = {\n    waterBody * evaporationRate\n  }\n\n  def condensation(evaporatedWater: Double, condensationRate: Double): Double = {\n    evaporatedWater * condensationRate\n  }\n\n  def precipitation(condensedWater: Double, precipitationRate: Double): Double = {\n    condensedWater * precipitationRate\n  }\n\n  def groundwaterFlow(precipitatedWater: Double, infiltrationRate: Double): Double = {\n    precipitatedWater * infiltrationRate\n  }\n\n  def simulateWaterCycle(waterBody: Double, evaporationRate: Double, condensationRate: Double, precipitationRate: Double, infiltrationRate: Double): WaterState = {\n    val evaporated = evaporation(waterBody, evaporationRate)\n    val condensed = condensation(evaporated, condensationRate)\n    val precipitated = precipitation(condensed, precipitationRate)\n    val groundwater = groundwaterFlow(precipitated, infiltrationRate)\n\n    WaterState(evaporated, condensed, precipitated, groundwater)\n  }\n\n  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\n    val initialWaterBody = 1000.0 // arbitrary units of water\n    val evaporationRate = 0.1 // 10% of the water evaporates\n    val condensationRate = 0.8 // 80% of evaporated water condenses\n    val precipitationRate = 0.7 // 70% of condensed water precipitates\n    val infiltrationRate = 0.5 // 50% of precipitated water becomes groundwater\n\n    val waterCycleState = simulateWaterCycle(initialWaterBody, evaporationRate, condensationRate, precipitationRate, infiltrationRate)\n\n    println(s\"Evaporated Water: ${waterCycleState.evaporated}\")\n    println(s\"Condensed Water: ${waterCycleState.condensed}\")\n    println(s\"Precipitated Water: ${waterCycleState.precipitated}\")\n    println(s\"Groundwater: ${waterCycleState.groundwater}\")\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Evaporation**: This function calculates the amount of water that evaporates from a water body based on a given evaporation rate.\n\n2. **Condensation**: This function calculates the amount of evaporated water that condenses based on a given condensation rate.\n\n3. **Precipitation**: This function calculates the amount of condensed water that falls as precipitation based on a given precipitation rate.\n\n4. **Groundwater Flow**: This function calculates the amount of precipitation that infiltrates into the ground to become groundwater based on an infiltration rate.\n\n5. **Simulation Function**: The `simulateWaterCycle` function runs the whole cycle, providing a simple model for the water cycle processes.\n\nThis code is a simplified model and doesn't take into account various complexities of the natural water cycle, but it should give you a basic framework to start with. Adjust the rates and initial conditions to model different scenarios."
