This involves analyzing text data, such as customer reviews, social media posts, or survey responses, to determine the sentiment expressed, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral. Businesses use sentiment analysis to gauge consumer opinions about their products or services, enabling them to make data-driven decisions to improve customer satisfaction and brand reputation."
