I am using Scikit-learn's metrics methods to calculate precision and F1 scores in my Python program. When there are no predicted samples, the output shows that precision and F-score are ill-defined and set to 0.0. Given that precision is defined as TP/(TP+FP) and F1 score is defined as 2TP/(2TP+FP+FN), I understand why precision might be undefined (0/0 scenario), but I am confused as to why F1 score would be ill-defined when FN is not zero. In my case, Scikit-learn's metrics return an accuracy of 0.8 and a recall of 0, implying that FN is not zero. What definition of F1 is Scikit-learn using that results in it being ill-defined?"

        "content": "Scikit-learn indicates that the F1 score is ill-defined when there are no predicted positive samples, leading to a division by zero scenario in the calculation of precision. This happens when both True Positives (TP) and False Positives (FP) are zero, resulting in an undefined precision value. \n\nThe F1 score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, defined as:\n\n\\[ \\text{F1} = 2 \\times \\frac{\\text{Precision} \\times \\text{Recall}}{\\text{Precision} + \\text{Recall}} \\]\n\nIn your case, since there are no predicted positive samples, both TP and FP are zero, making precision undefined because it leads to a 0/0 scenario. When precision is undefined, the F1 score also becomes undefined because it relies on precision to compute its value. Even if FN is greater than zero, recall will be correctly computed, but it doesn't affect the undefined nature of precision in this context.\n\nScikit-learn handles this situation by setting precision and the F1 score to 0.0 and issues a warning indicating they are ill-defined. This is a way to signal that the model didn't predict any positive samples, and hence, precision and the F1 score cannot be reliably computed.\n\nTo handle such cases, you might want to consider using the `zero_division` parameter available in Scikit-learn's metric functions, which allows you to specify what value to return when there is a zero division, thereby avoiding the warning and providing a more meaningful output based on your context."
