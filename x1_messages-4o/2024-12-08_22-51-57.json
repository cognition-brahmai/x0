Here's a Python script to do that:\n\n```python\n# Function to generate terms of the quadratic pattern\ndef generate_quadratic_terms():\n    terms = []\n    for n in range(10):  # Loop from n=0 to n=9\n        term = n**2 + n + 1\n        terms.append(term)\n    return terms\n\n# Generate and print the first 10 terms\nquadratic_terms = generate_quadratic_terms()\nprint(\"The first 10 terms of the quadratic pattern are:\", quadratic_terms)\n```\n\nWhen you run this script, it will output the first 10 terms of the sequence defined by the polynomial \\( n^2 + n + 1 \\)."
