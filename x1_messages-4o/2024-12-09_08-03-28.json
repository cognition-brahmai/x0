I'm aware of the \"bad\" and \"good\" approach of append function as shown below:\n\n```python\ndef bad_append(new_item, a_list=[]):\n    a_list.append(new_item)\n    return a_list\n\ndef good_append(new_item, a_list=None):\n    if a_list is None:\n        a_list = []\n    a_list.append(new_item)\n    return a_list\n```\nI understand the necessity of the good syntax but I find it not so in line with Python's principle of having elegant and easy-to-use syntax. I'm not querying why or how it happens, instead, I'm wondering why there isn't a simpler built-in alternative in the language. Ideally, I'd prefer a way to do something within the `def` itself, where the name argument is linked to a 'local' or 'new' mutable object within the `def`. \n\nFor instance, I'm imagining something like this:\n\n```python\ndef better_append(new_item, a_list=immutable([])):\n    a_list.append(new_item)\n    return a_list\n```\nIs there a specific reason why this hasn't been implemented in Python?"

        "content": "The behavior you're describing with mutable default arguments is a well-known aspect of Python, and it often trips up beginners. The reason Python behaves this way is due to how default arguments are handled. In Python, default argument values are evaluated once when the function is defined, not each time the function is called. This means that if you use a mutable object (like a list or dictionary) as a default value, that object is shared across all calls to the function that don't provide an explicit argument for that parameter.\n\nYour idea of having a language feature, like `immutable([])`, that ensures a fresh, local object is created each time a function is called, is indeed interesting. However, there are a few reasons why such a feature might not be part of Python:\n\n1. **Simplicity and Explicitness**: Python's philosophy, as outlined in the Zen of Python, includes principles like \"Explicit is better than implicit.\" The current pattern with `None` is explicit and makes it clear that you are intentionally initializing a new object for each call. Introducing a new syntax for this behavior might obscure what's happening behind the scenes, making it less clear for readers of the code who are not familiar with the feature.\n\n2. **Language Consistency**: Introducing a special syntax or function like `immutable()` could add complexity to the language. Python tends to favor a small set of orthogonal features that can be combined in various ways, rather than a large number of specialized features.\n\n3. **Backward Compatibility**: Any change to the language that affects how functions are defined or called must be carefully considered in terms of backward compatibility. Existing codebases rely on current behavior, and changes could introduce subtle bugs.\n\n4. **Alternatives and Workarounds**: The current pattern of checking if the argument is `None` and then initializing it is well-known and widely adopted. It serves as a workaround that fits within existing language features, without the need for additional syntax.\n\nWhile Python doesn't currently offer a built-in feature to handle this directly in the `def` statement, your suggestion is quite thoughtful. Language development involves balancing new features with the existing design principles and community practices. If you feel strongly about this, you might consider proposing it to the Python community through the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process, where new ideas and changes to the language are discussed and considered."
