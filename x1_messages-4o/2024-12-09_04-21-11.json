And if I already have a dataset with a column of 1's, would setting fit_intercept to FALSE account for that or would it force it to fit a zero intercept model? Also, if I already have a column of 1's in my dataset of predictors (the 1's are for the intercept), would setting fit_intercept to FALSE remove this column of 1's?

        "content": "In `sklearn`'s `LinearRegression` method, the `fit_intercept` parameter controls whether or not the intercept (bias term) should be calculated as part of the model fitting process.\n\n1. **If `fit_intercept=True`:**\n   - The model will calculate the intercept term. This means it will internally add a column of 1s to your dataset if such a column does not already exist. It does not literally modify your dataset by adding a column, but conceptually, it considers an additional bias term.\n   - If your dataset already contains a column of 1s for the intercept, setting `fit_intercept=True` might lead to multicollinearity issues, as the model will essentially be trying to calculate an intercept twice (once implicitly and once explicitly).\n\n2. **If `fit_intercept=False`:**\n   - The model will not calculate an intercept term, meaning it will assume that your data is already centered or that you have manually included an intercept in your dataset.\n   - If you have a column of 1s in your dataset for the intercept and you set `fit_intercept=False`, the model will use that column as the intercept. It will not remove the column; it simply acknowledges that you have manually accounted for the intercept.\n\nSo, if you already have a column of 1s in your dataset and want to use it as the intercept, you should set `fit_intercept=False`. This tells the model not to add an additional intercept term. Conversely, if you do not have such a column and want the model to compute the intercept, you should set `fit_intercept=True`."
