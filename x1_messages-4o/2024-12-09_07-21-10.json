I am developing a Tic Tac Toe game and I'm having difficulty in checking for a draw state. The list represents the board, and when a player makes a move, the integer they moved on is replaced with their marker ('x' or 'o'). I have checks in place to look for a winning state, but I can't check for a draw state, where none of the list values are integers but a winning state has not been set. I have attempted to use the following code, but I'm facing issues with the 'elif' condition:\n\n```python\nif any(board) != playerOne or any(board) != playerTwo:\n    print 'continue'\nelif all(board) == playerOne or playerTwo:\n    print 'Draw'\n```\nI think the problem is with my 'or' operator. I want to check if every item on the board is either playerOne marker or playerTwo marker. If I use the following code\n\n```python\nelif all(board) == playerOne or all(board) == playerTwo:\n```\nit checks if every place on the board was playerOne or every place on the board is playerTwo, which it won't be. So how do I check if the board is taken up by a combination of playerOne markers and playerTwo markers?"

        "content": "To check for a draw state in your Tic Tac Toe game, you need to determine if the board is completely filled with player markers ('x' or 'o') and there is no winning state. The logic you've outlined needs a bit of adjustment to achieve this.\n\nThe `any()` and `all()` functions can be useful, but in this context, we need to ensure all elements are either `playerOne` or `playerTwo`. Here's a way to check for a draw state:\n\n1. Ensure there are no integers remaining on the board, meaning all positions have been filled with either 'x' or 'o'.\n2. Confirm that no winning condition is satisfied (you mentioned you already have logic for checking this).\n\nHere's a revised version of your code snippet:\n\n```python\ndef is_draw(board, playerOne, playerTwo):\n    # Check if all positions are filled with either playerOne or playerTwo markers\n    if all(isinstance(pos, str) and (pos == playerOne or pos == playerTwo) for pos in board):\n        return True\n    return False\n\n# Example usage:\nboard = ['x', 'o', 'x', 'o', 'o', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'o']\nplayerOne = 'x'\nplayerTwo = 'o'\n\n# Assuming you have a function is_winning_state(board, player) to check for a win\nif not is_winning_state(board, playerOne) and not is_winning_state(board, playerTwo) and is_draw(board, playerOne, playerTwo):\n    print('Draw')\nelse:\n    print('Continue')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`isinstance(pos, str)`**: This checks if the position is filled by a player's marker, assuming markers are strings and unfilled positions are not.\n- **`all(...)`**: This ensures every position on the board is either `playerOne` or `playerTwo`.\n- **`is_winning_state(board, player)`**: Placeholder for your function that checks if a player has won.\n\nThis way, you check for a draw by ensuring all board positions are filled with valid player markers and no winning condition exists."
