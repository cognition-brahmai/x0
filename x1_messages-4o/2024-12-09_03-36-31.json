Consider the following pandas dataframe:\n\n```python\nIn [114]:\n\ndf['movie_title'].head()\n\n\u200b\nOut[114]:\n\n0     Toy Story (1995)\n1     GoldenEye (1995)\n2    Four Rooms (1995)\n3    Get Shorty (1995)\n4       Copycat (1995)\n...\nName: movie_title, dtype: object\n```\n\nI would like to extract just the titles of the movies using the regular expression `\\b([^\\d\\W]+)\\b`. I tried the following code:\n\n```python\ndf_3['movie_title'] = df_3['movie_title'].str.extract('\\b([^\\d\\W]+)\\b')\ndf_3['movie_title']\n```\n\nBut the output I get is NaN for all the rows:\n\n```python\n0       NaN\n1       NaN\n2       NaN\n3       NaN\n4       NaN\n5       NaN\n6       NaN\n7       NaN\n8       NaN\n```\n\nCan you help me with how to extract specific features from text in a pandas dataframe? More specifically, how can I extract just the titles of the movies in a completely new dataframe? The desired output should be:\n\n```python\nOut[114]:\n\n0     Toy Story\n1     GoldenEye\n2    Four Rooms\n3    Get Shorty\n4       Copycat\n...\nName: movie_title, dtype: object\n```"

        "content": "To extract just the movie titles from the `movie_title` column in your pandas DataFrame, you can use a regular expression that captures the sequence of characters before the year in parentheses. The issue with your current regular expression `\\b([^\\d\\W]+)\\b` is that it only captures a single word and not the entire title. Instead, you should use an expression that matches everything before the opening parenthesis.\n\nHere's a corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming df is your original DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    'movie_title': [\n        'Toy Story (1995)',\n        'GoldenEye (1995)',\n        'Four Rooms (1995)',\n        'Get Shorty (1995)',\n        'Copycat (1995)'\n    ]\n})\n\n# Use a regular expression to extract the movie title\n# The pattern '(.*?)' matches any character sequence non-greedily until the space before the opening parenthesis\ndf['movie_title'] = df['movie_title'].str.extract(r'^(.*?)\\s*\\(\\d{4}\\)')\n\nprint(df['movie_title'])\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the regular expression used:\n\n- `^`: Asserts the start of a string.\n- `(.*?)`: Captures any character (`.`) zero or more times (`*`) in a non-greedy way (`?`), allowing for multiple words in the title.\n- `\\s*`: Matches any whitespace character (space) zero or more times, which accounts for any spaces between the title and the year.\n- `\\(\\d{4}\\)`: Matches the year in parentheses.\n\nThis will give you the desired output where only the titles of the movies are captured."
