Use your Python skills to check if the number you found is a multiple of 3 or not. If it is a multiple of 3, you need to find another number that satisfies all the conditions in the riddle. Once you find the correct number, round the output of 651 divided by that number to two decimal places, and print the result along with the current date and time. Best of luck with this complex puzzle!"

        "content": "To address this puzzle, we need to follow several steps:\n\n1. Identify a number that satisfies certain unknown conditions from the riddle, which we don't have the details of.\n2. Ensure that this number is not a multiple of 3.\n3. Divide 651 by this number.\n4. Round the result to two decimal places.\n5. Output the result along with the current date and time.\n\nSince we don't have the specific conditions from the riddle, let's assume we are looking for a number, say 5, that is not a multiple of 3. Here's how you can do this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Assume the number found is 5 (as an example)\nnumber = 5\n\n# Check if the number is not a multiple of 3\nif number % 3 != 0:\n    # Perform the division\n    result = 651 / number\n    \n    # Round the result to two decimal places\n    rounded_result = round(result, 2)\n    \n    # Get the current date and time\n    current_datetime = datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n    \n    # Print the result and current date and time\n    print(f\"Result: {rounded_result}\")\n    print(f\"Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The selected number is a multiple of 3, please choose another number.\")\n```\n\nThis script assumes the number 5, which is not a multiple of 3, satisfies the unknown conditions. The result will be printed along with the current date and time. You can replace 5 with any other number that satisfies your specific conditions."
