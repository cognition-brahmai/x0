        "content": "To plot a single data point correctly on the graph, you should modify the style used for plotting the point. The current use of `'r-'` means you are trying to plot a line, which is not suitable for a single point. Instead, you should use a marker style to represent the point. Here's how you can modify the code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [3, 4, 6]})\npoint = pd.DataFrame({'x': [2], 'y': [5]})\n\n# Plot the line\nax = df.plot(x='x', y='y', label='line')\n\n# Plot the single point with a marker style\npoint.plot(x='x', y='y', ax=ax, style='ro', label='point', markersize=10)\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this code, `'ro'` is used to plot the point with a red circle marker, and `markersize=10` is added to make the point more visible. This change will ensure the single data point is displayed correctly on the plot."
