I'm trying to convert the standard dict comprehension in my BeautifulSoup and requests code to an OrderedDict comprehension, but it doesn't seem to be working. Here is my current code:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\n\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')\ntables = soup.find_all('table')\nt_data = OrderedDict()\nrows = tables[1].find_all('tr')\nt_data = {row.th.text: row.td.text for row in rows if row.td }\n```\nI've left it as a normal dict comprehension for now, but I'm wondering how I can change this to an OrderedDict comprehension."

        "content": "In Python, comprehension syntax specifically returns a standard dictionary, not an `OrderedDict`. However, you can achieve a similar result by creating an `OrderedDict` from a generator expression or a list comprehension. Here's how you can modify your code to create an `OrderedDict`:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\n\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')\ntables = soup.find_all('table')\nrows = tables[1].find_all('tr')\n\n# Create a generator of key-value pairs\nt_data_generator = ((row.th.text, row.td.text) for row in rows if row.td)\n\n# Pass the generator to the OrderedDict constructor\nt_data = OrderedDict(t_data_generator)\n```\n\nThis approach uses a generator expression to produce key-value pairs and then initializes the `OrderedDict` using that generator. By doing so, the insertion order is preserved, which is the primary feature of `OrderedDict`. \n\nNote: As of Python 3.7, the built-in `dict` maintains insertion order as well, but `OrderedDict` is still useful for its additional methods and explicitness about order preservation in earlier Python versions."
