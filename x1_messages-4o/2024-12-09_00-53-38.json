I've been launching Jupyter Notebook for years with this command: `jupyter-notebook --port=7000 --no-browser --no-mathjax`. Recently, when I try to open Jupyter on my browser, it asks me for a password even though I've never set one. Note that if I set the port to a value different than 7000 (e.g., the default 8888), the interface will open with no problem. I am running Jupyter locally, with Python 3.5.2 and the following modules installed: `jupyter (1.0.0), jupyter-client (4.4.0), jupyter-console (5.0.0), jupyter-core (4.2.1), ipykernel (4.5.2), ipython (5.1.0), ipython-genutils (0.1.0), nbconvert (4.3.0), nbformat (4.2.0), notebook (4.3.0)`. I don't have a Jupyter configurations file. The server outputs certain lines and then prompts a page asking me to insert a password I've never set before."

        "content": "When Jupyter Notebook prompts for a password unexpectedly, it could be due to a few reasons. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Token Authentication**: Recent versions of Jupyter use token-based authentication by default. When you start Jupyter Notebook, it generates a URL with a token. This token can be used in place of a password. Check the terminal where you launched Jupyter and look for a URL that includes `?token=...`. Use this URL to access Jupyter Notebook in your browser.\n\n2. **Change Configuration Settings**: If you want to disable password/token authentication, you can create a Jupyter configuration file and modify it:\n\n   - Generate a configuration file if it doesn't exist by running:\n     ```bash\n     jupyter notebook --generate-config\n     ```\n   - This will create a `jupyter_notebook_config.py` file typically located in the `~/.jupyter/` directory.\n\n   - Open this file and find the line that starts with `#c.NotebookApp.token = ''`. Remove the `#` to uncomment the line and ensure it is set to an empty string:\n     ```python\n     c.NotebookApp.token = ''\n     ```\n\n   - Similarly, look for `#c.NotebookApp.password = ''`. Uncomment and ensure it is set to an empty string:\n     ```python\n     c.NotebookApp.password = ''\n     ```\n\n3. **Port Issues**: Since you mentioned that changing the port works, ensure that no other service is running on port 7000. Another service might be causing a conflict, which results in unexpected behavior.\n\n4. **Firewall or Security Software**: Check if there are any firewall rules or security software settings that might be affecting the port 7000, leading to the password prompt.\n\n5. **Upgrade or Reinstall Jupyter**: Since you are using an older version of Python and Jupyter, consider upgrading to a newer version if possible. This might resolve any bugs or issues with the older version.\n\n6. **Clear Browser Cache**: Sometimes the browser cache might cause unexpected behavior. Clear your browser cache or try accessing Jupyter Notebook in incognito mode.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to disable the password prompt for your Jupyter Notebook session."
