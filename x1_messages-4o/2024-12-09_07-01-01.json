        "content": "On a Linux system, you have several options for accessing and reading Python documentation:\n\n1. **Online Documentation**: The most straightforward way is to access the Python documentation online at [docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org/). This site provides comprehensive and up-to-date documentation for all Python versions.\n\n2. **Built-in Help System**: You can use Python's built-in help system in the terminal. Just open a terminal and type `python` to start the Python interpreter, then use the `help()` function. For example:\n   ```python\n   help()  # Starts the help utility\n   help(str)  # Provides help on the string object\n   ```\n\n3. **Man Pages**: Some Linux distributions include Python man pages. You can access them using the `man` command:\n   ```bash\n   man python\n   ```\n\n4. **Download HTML Documentation**: You can download the HTML version of the Python documentation from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/doc/). Once downloaded, you can open it with any web browser.\n\n5. **PDF Documentation**: If you prefer a PDF format, you can also download the PDF version of the documentation from the official Python website.\n\n6. **Info Pages**: Some distributions offer Python documentation in the form of info pages, which you can read using the `info` command:\n   ```bash\n   info python\n   ```\n\n7. **Install Python Documentation Package**: Some package managers provide a separate package for Python documentation. For example, on Ubuntu or Debian-based systems, you can install it using:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install python3-doc\n   ```\n   After installing, you can find the documentation in `/usr/share/doc/python3/html`.\n\n8. **Third-Party Tools**: There are third-party tools like `pydoc` or `Dash` (with Zeal being its Linux equivalent) that can help you browse documentation offline.\n\nWhile Linux doesn't natively support the .chm format, these alternatives should provide you with comprehensive and convenient access to Python documentation."
