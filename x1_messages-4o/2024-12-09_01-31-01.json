We have successfully set up our code base under Python 2.6 and in preparation for Python 3.0, we've begun incorporating 'from __future__ import unicode_literals' into our .py files as we modify them. I'm curious to know if anyone has encountered any non-obvious issues, possibly after spending a considerable amount of time debugging."

        "content": "Using `from __future__ import unicode_literals` in Python 2.6 can indeed lead to some unexpected issues, especially if your codebase was originally developed with the assumption that string literals are of type `str` (bytes) rather than `unicode`. Here are some potential problems and considerations to keep in mind:\n\n1. **String Type Changes**: By default, string literals in Python 2 are of type `str`, but with `unicode_literals`, they become `unicode`. This can cause issues where the code expects a byte string.\n\n2. **Incompatibility with APIs**: Many libraries and functions in Python 2 expect byte strings. Passing a `unicode` string instead can lead to errors or unexpected behavior.\n\n3. **String Concatenation**: If you concatenate a `unicode` string with a `str` string, it will implicitly try to decode the `str` using the default ASCII encoding, which can fail if there are non-ASCII characters. You may need to explicitly decode or encode strings as needed.\n\n4. **File Handling**: When reading from or writing to files, make sure the file operations are aware of the string type. Binary files should be handled with byte strings, while text files should be dealt with using `unicode` strings.\n\n5. **String Formatting**: Ensure that string formatting operations are compatible, as mixing `str` and `unicode` types in formatting can lead to errors.\n\n6. **Regular Expressions**: The `re` module in Python 2 can behave differently when dealing with `unicode` strings compared to `str` strings. Make sure your regular expressions are updated accordingly.\n\n7. **Third-Party Libraries**: Some third-party libraries may not handle `unicode` strings gracefully. Test your code thoroughly if it interacts with external libraries or APIs.\n\n8. **Testing and Debugging**: It is crucial to have a comprehensive suite of tests that can catch these issues early. Consider using tools like `2to3` or `six` to assist with compatibility between Python 2 and 3.\n\n9. **Default Encoding**: Be aware of the default encoding settings in your environment, as these can affect how strings are encoded and decoded.\n\nTo mitigate these issues, you may need to audit your codebase for places where the string type assumptions are made and update them accordingly. It may also be helpful to gradually introduce `unicode_literals` and thoroughly test each change to ensure that it does not introduce new bugs."
