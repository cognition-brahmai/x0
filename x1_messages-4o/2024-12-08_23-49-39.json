        "content": "Adding additional breathing exercises can enhance the mindfulness experience for users. Here are some suggestions for additional exercises you could implement, along with the Swift code for each:\n\n### 1. **4-7-8 Breathing Exercise**\nThis exercise involves inhaling for 4 seconds, holding the breath for 7 seconds, and exhaling slowly for 8 seconds.\n\n```swift\nfunc startFourSevenEightBreathingExercise() {\n    // Instruct the user to breathe in for 4 seconds\n    playSound(soundName: \"inhale\")\n    DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 4.0) {\n        // Instruct the user to hold their breath for 7 seconds\n        self.playSound(soundName: \"hold\")\n        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 7.0) {\n            // Instruct the user to exhale for 8 seconds\n            self.playSound(soundName: \"exhale\")\n            DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 8.0) {\n                // Repeat the cycle or end the exercise\n                self.startFourSevenEightBreathingExercise()\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. **Diaphragmatic Breathing Exercise**\nThis exercise focuses on deep breathing using the diaphragm. It can be done with longer inhale and exhale times.\n\n```swift\nfunc startDiaphragmaticBreathingExercise() {\n    // Instruct the user to place one hand on the chest and the other on the belly\n    // Instruct the user to breathe deeply through the nose for 5 seconds\n    playSound(soundName: \"inhale\")\n    DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 5.0) {\n        // Instruct the user to exhale slowly through the mouth for 5 seconds\n        self.playSound(soundName: \"exhale\")\n        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 5.0) {\n            // Repeat the cycle or end the exercise\n            self.startDiaphragmaticBreathingExercise()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. **Paced Breathing**\nThis involves a guided breathing exercise with a customizable ratio of inhale and exhale times.\n\n```swift\nfunc startPacedBreathingExercise(inhaleTime: Double, exhaleTime: Double) {\n    // Instruct the user to breathe in for the given inhale time\n    playSound(soundName: \"inhale\")\n    DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + inhaleTime) {\n        // Instruct the user to exhale for the given exhale time\n        self.playSound(soundName: \"exhale\")\n        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + exhaleTime) {\n            // Repeat the cycle or end the exercise\n            self.startPacedBreathingExercise(inhaleTime: inhaleTime, exhaleTime: exhaleTime)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. **Equal Breathing (Sama Vritti)**\nThis exercise involves equal inhale and exhale times, promoting calmness and balance.\n\n```swift\nfunc startEqualBreathingExercise() {\n    // Instruct the user to breathe in for 4 seconds\n    playSound(soundName: \"inhale\")\n    DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 4.0) {\n        // Instruct the user to exhale for 4 seconds\n        self.playSound(soundName: \"exhale\")\n        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 4.0) {\n            // Repeat the cycle or end the exercise\n            self.startEqualBreathingExercise()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThese exercises can be integrated into your app to provide a variety of options for users seeking different mindfulness and relaxation techniques. Adjust the durations and sounds as needed to tailor the experience to your audience."
