For instance, if I have two dictionaries like dict1 = {'a':[1], 'b':[2]} and dict2 = {'b':[3], 'c':[4]}, I want to merge them into a new dictionary dict3 = {'a':[1], 'b':[2,3], 'c':[4]}. The function should also include a \"conflict\" parameter that can be set to True or False. If \"conflict\" is set to False, the dictionaries should merge as previously described. However, if \"conflict\" is set to True, the function should rename the conflicting keys as 'key_1' and 'key_2' in the merged dictionary, for instance, dict3 = {'a':[1], 'b_1':[2], 'b_2':[3], 'c':[4]}. I have tried to append the two dictionaries with the following code, but I am not sure how to do it correctly:\n<pre><code>for key in dict1.keys():\n    if dict2.has_key(key):\n        dict2[key].append(dict1[key])\n</code></pre>"

Here's a Python function that does exactly that:\n\n```python\ndef merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2, conflict=False):\n    merged_dict = {}\n\n    for key in dict1:\n        if key in dict2:\n            if conflict:\n                # Handle conflict by renaming keys\n                merged_dict[f\"{key}_1\"] = dict1[key]\n                merged_dict[f\"{key}_2\"] = dict2[key]\n            else:\n                # Merge lists if no conflict\n                merged_dict[key] = dict1[key] + dict2[key]\n        else:\n            # Add non-conflicting key from dict1\n            merged_dict[key] = dict1[key]\n\n    for key in dict2:\n        if key not in dict1:\n            # Add non-conflicting key from dict2\n            merged_dict[key] = dict2[key]\n\n    return merged_dict\n\n# Example usage:\ndict1 = {'a': [1], 'b': [2]}\ndict2 = {'b': [3], 'c': [4]}\n\n# Merge without conflict\nresult_no_conflict = merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2, conflict=False)\nprint(\"Merged without conflict:\", result_no_conflict)\n\n# Merge with conflict\nresult_with_conflict = merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2, conflict=True)\nprint(\"Merged with conflict:\", result_with_conflict)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Loop through `dict1`**:\n   - If a key exists in both dictionaries and `conflict` is `True`, rename the keys and assign their respective values.\n   - If `conflict` is `False`, merge the lists associated with the key.\n\n2. **Loop through `dict2`**:\n   - Add keys from `dict2` that are not in `dict1`.\n\nThis function will merge the dictionaries according to the specified `conflict` behavior. You can adjust the code or logic further to fit any additional requirements or edge cases you may have."
