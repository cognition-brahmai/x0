Here's a simple example:\n\n```python\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nfor value in my_list:\n    print(value)\n```\n\nThis approach is efficient because it directly iterates over the elements of the list without needing to manage indices manually. The `for` loop is designed for iteration, making the code clean, readable, and concise."
