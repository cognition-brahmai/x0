Here's a step-by-step guide on how to design such a website:\n\n### 1. **Structure & Layout**\n\n- **Semantic HTML**: Use HTML5 semantic elements (like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`) to create a logical structure that screen readers can interpret easily.\n- **Consistent Layout**: Maintain a consistent layout across all pages to help users familiarize themselves with the site.\n\n### 2. **Navigation**\n\n- **Keyboard Accessibility**: Ensure that all interactive elements (like menus, links, and buttons) are accessible via keyboard navigation (e.g., using the Tab key).\n- **Skip to Content Link**: Provide a \"Skip to Content\" link at the top of each page to allow users to bypass repetitive navigation links.\n\n### 3. **Text & Typography**\n\n- **Readable Fonts**: Use clear and legible fonts. Avoid overly decorative fonts for body text.\n- **Adjustable Text Size**: Allow users to resize text using browser settings without breaking the layout.\n\n### 4. **Color & Contrast**\n\n- **High Contrast**: Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors (at least a 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text and 3:1 for large text).\n- **Color Independence**: Do not rely on color alone to convey information. Use text labels or patterns in addition to color.\n\n### 5. **Images & Media**\n\n- **Alt Text**: Provide descriptive alt text for all images, especially product images, to convey information about the jewelry to screen reader users.\n- **Avoid Text in Images**: Do not use images of text; if unavoidable, ensure the text is included in alt attributes.\n\n### 6. **Forms & Input Fields**\n\n- **Labels and Instructions**: Ensure all form fields have associated labels. Use clear instructions and error messages.\n- **Focus Indicators**: Make sure there are visible focus indicators for form fields and interactive elements.\n\n### 7. **Interactive Elements**\n\n- **Descriptive Links**: Use descriptive link text that makes sense out of context (e.g., \"View our handmade earrings collection\" instead of \"Click here\").\n- **Accessible Dropdowns and Modals**: Ensure dropdowns and modal dialogues are accessible with a keyboard and screen readers.\n\n### 8. **Feedback & Error Handling**\n\n- **Accessible Alerts**: Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles and properties to provide accessible feedback for errors, success messages, and updates.\n- **Consistent Feedback**: Ensure feedback messages are consistent in style and placement.\n\n### 9. **Testing & Validation**\n\n- **Screen Reader Testing**: Test the website with popular screen readers like NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver.\n- **WCAG Compliance**: Aim for WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance. Use tools like WAVE or Axe to evaluate accessibility.\n\n### 10. **Additional Tools & Resources**\n\n- **Accessibility Statement**: Include an accessibility statement on your website detailing your commitment to accessibility and providing contact information for accessibility-related issues.\n- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update and refine accessibility features based on user feedback and new accessibility standards.\n\nBy integrating these accessibility features, you'll create a more inclusive online store that can be enjoyed by all users, regardless of their visual abilities."
