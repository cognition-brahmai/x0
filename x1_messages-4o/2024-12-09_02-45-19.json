I attempted to do this using the datetime module in Python, with the following code:\n\n```python\nimport datetime\nnow = datetime.datetime.now()\ndf = df.withColumn(\"date\", str(now)[:10])\n```\n\nHowever, I encountered an AssertionError, stating that `col should be Column`. How can I resolve this?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is because the `withColumn` function in PySpark expects the second argument to be a PySpark `Column` object, rather than a Python string. To create a new column and fill it with the current date, you should use PySpark's built-in functions.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this using the `current_date` function from PySpark:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import current_date\n\n# Initialize Spark session\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"example\").getOrCreate()\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = [(\"Alice\", 1), (\"Bob\", 2)]\ndf = spark.createDataFrame(data, [\"name\", \"id\"])\n\n# Add a new column with the current date\ndf = df.withColumn(\"date\", current_date())\n\n# Show the DataFrame\ndf.show()\n```\n\nThis will add a new column named `date` to your DataFrame, filled with the current date for each row. The `current_date()` function provides the current date as a PySpark `Column` object, which is suitable for use with `withColumn`."
