        "content": "In Python, you can represent infinity using the `float` type. You can use the special value `float('inf')` to represent positive infinity. This representation is compliant with the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic, which ensures that it behaves as you expect: no other numeric value will be greater than positive infinity.\n\nHere's how you can use it:\n\n```python\n# Representing positive infinity\npositive_infinity = float('inf')\n\n# Representing negative infinity\nnegative_infinity = float('-inf')\n\n# Example usage\nprint(positive_infinity)  # Output: inf\nprint(negative_infinity)  # Output: -inf\n\n# Checking comparisons\nprint(1000 < positive_infinity)  # Output: True\nprint(-1000 > negative_infinity)  # Output: True\nprint(positive_infinity > negative_infinity)  # Output: True\n```\n\nYou can use `positive_infinity` wherever you need to represent an infinite value, ensuring that no other numeric value will exceed it. Similarly, `negative_infinity` can be used when you need a value smaller than all others."
