        "content": "Certainly! You can use Python's `datetime` module to convert a date string into the day of the week. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n1. Use `strptime` from the `datetime` module to parse the date string into a `datetime` object.\n2. Use the `strftime` method to format the `datetime` object into the desired day of the week.\n\nHere's a sample code snippet to help you:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Your date string\ndate_string = 'January 11, 2010'\n\n# Convert the date string to a datetime object\ndate_object = datetime.strptime(date_string, '%B %d, %Y')\n\n# Get the day of the week in full (like 'Monday')\nday_of_week_full = date_object.strftime('%A')\n\n# Get the day of the week abbreviated (like 'Mon')\nday_of_week_abbr = date_object.strftime('%a')\n\nprint(\"Full day of the week:\", day_of_week_full)\nprint(\"Abbreviated day of the week:\", day_of_week_abbr)\n```\n\nExplanation of the format codes:\n- `%B` - Full month name\n- `%d` - Day of the month\n- `%Y` - Four-digit year\n- `%A` - Full weekday name\n- `%a` - Abbreviated weekday name\n\nThis will output:\n```\nFull day of the week: Monday\nAbbreviated day of the week: Mon\n```\n\nYou can choose either the full name or the abbreviated name as per your requirement."
