However, I'm encountering an issue with Python stating that 'times' is being used prior to global declaration. I have declared 'times' at the beginning as a list and then again in a function. Here is my code:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ntimes = []\n\ndef timeit():\n    input(\"Press ENTER to start: \")\n    start_time = time.time()\n    input(\"Press ENTER to stop: \")\n    end_time = time.time()\n    the_time = round(end_time - start_time, 2)\n    print(str(the_time))\n    times.append(the_time)\n    global times\n    main()\n\ndef main():\n    print (\"Do you want to...\")\n    print (\"1. Time your solving\")\n    print (\"2. See your solvings\")\n    dothis = input(\":: \")\n    if dothis == \"1\":\n        timeit()\n    elif dothis == \"2\":\n        sorte_times = times.sort()\n        sorted_times = sorte_times.reverse()\n        for curr_time in sorted_times:\n            print(\"%d - %f\" % ((sorted_times.index(curr_time)+1), curr_time))\n    else:\n        print (\"WTF? Please enter a valid number...\")\n        main()\n\nmain()\n```\nI'm new to Python and would appreciate any help in resolving this issue."

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the incorrect placement and usage of the `global` keyword. In Python, the `global` keyword is used to declare a variable as global within a function, so you can modify it. However, it should be declared before you use the variable in the function, not after. \n\nIn your code, you're trying to append to `times` before declaring it as global inside the `timeit` function. Also, there are some other issues with your code, such as how you're handling the sorting and printing of times. Let's address these issues and correct your code:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ntimes = []\n\ndef timeit():\n    global times  # Declare 'times' as global so you can modify it\n    input(\"Press ENTER to start: \")\n    start_time = time.time()\n    input(\"Press ENTER to stop: \")\n    end_time = time.time()\n    the_time = round(end_time - start_time, 2)\n    print(f\"Time: {the_time} seconds\")\n    times.append(the_time)\n    main()\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Do you want to...\")\n    print(\"1. Time your solving\")\n    print(\"2. See your solving times\")\n    dothis = input(\":: \")\n    if dothis == \"1\":\n        timeit()\n    elif dothis == \"2\":\n        show_times()\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid choice. Please enter a valid number.\")\n        main()\n\ndef show_times():\n    if not times:\n        print(\"No solving times recorded yet.\")\n    else:\n        sorted_times = sorted(times)\n        print(\"Your solving times (in seconds):\")\n        for index, curr_time in enumerate(sorted_times, start=1):\n            print(f\"{index}. {curr_time}\")\n    main()\n\nmain()\n```\n\n### Key Changes and Fixes:\n1. **Global Declaration:** The `global times` statement is now correctly placed at the beginning of the `timeit` function.\n\n2. **Sorting and Display:**\n   - I've created a separate function `show_times()` for displaying the times, which makes it clearer and separates concerns.\n   - Used `sorted()` to get a sorted list of times. Unlike `list.sort()`, `sorted()` returns a new sorted list.\n   - Used `enumerate()` to get both the index and the value when iterating over `sorted_times`, which simplifies your code.\n\n3. **User Feedback:**\n   - Added a message when there are no recorded times yet.\n\nThis should resolve the issues you're facing and make your program work more as expected."
