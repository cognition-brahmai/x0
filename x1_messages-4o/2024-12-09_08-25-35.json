        "content": "To convert an XML file using XSLT in Python, you can use the `lxml` library, which provides a powerful and convenient way to handle XML and XSLT transformations. Below is a Python implementation of your PHP code using `lxml`:\n\nFirst, make sure you have the `lxml` library installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install lxml\n```\n\nHere is the Python code that replicates your PHP example:\n\n```python\nfrom lxml import etree\n\n# Load the XML file\nxml_file_name = \"example.fb2\"\nxml = etree.parse(xml_file_name)\n\n# Load the XSLT file\nxsl_file_name = \"example.xsl\"\nxsl = etree.parse(xsl_file_name)\n\n# Configure the transformer\ntransform = etree.XSLT(xsl)\n\n# Transform the XML\nresult = transform(xml)\n\n# Output the transformed XML\nprint(str(result))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Import the Library**: We import `etree` from `lxml`, which is used for parsing and transforming XML and XSLT.\n\n2. **Load XML and XSLT Files**: We use `etree.parse()` to load the XML and XSLT files.\n\n3. **Configure the Transformer**: We create an `XSLT` object using the parsed XSLT document.\n\n4. **Transform the XML**: We call the `transform()` method on the XSLT object and pass the XML document to it. This method returns the transformed document.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Finally, we print the result of the transformation.\n\nMake sure that the paths to your XML and XSLT files are correct. You can modify the file paths as needed to point to the correct location of your files."
