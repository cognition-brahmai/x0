I have tried resolving the issue by installing nbformat using pip install nbformat in the console as suggested in a feed on GitHub and a question on StackOverflow, but it did not work. Interestingly, the code seems to run without an error when I remove the last two lines. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that the necessary package to render the plot inline in Visual Studio Code is not properly installed or configured. Let's go through some steps to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure nbformat is installed:**\n   You've already tried this, but let's confirm that `nbformat` is correctly installed. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade nbformat\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Jupyter:**\n   If you haven't already, you should install the Jupyter package, as it may help with rendering plots inline in environments that mimic Jupyter functionality:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install jupyter\n   ```\n\n3. **Check if you're running in a Jupyter-like environment:**\n   Make sure that Visual Studio Code is set up to run your script in an environment that supports Jupyter-like rendering, such as using the Jupyter extension. This extension allows you to run cells in a notebook-style interface and display plots inline.\n\n4. **Use `plotly.io.show` as an alternative:**\n   You can try using `plotly.io.show` to see if it resolves the issue:\n\n   ```python\n   import plotly.io as pio\n\n   pio.renderers.default = 'browser'  # This will open plots in your default web browser\n   fig.show()\n   ```\n\n   By setting the renderer to 'browser', the plot will open in your web browser instead of trying to render inline. This bypasses the need for certain packages that might not be properly configured in your current environment.\n\n5. **Verify the Python Environment:**\n   Ensure that the Python interpreter selected in Visual Studio Code is the one where you have installed all the necessary packages. You can check and change the interpreter by clicking on the Python version displayed in the status bar at the bottom-left corner of VS Code.\n\n6. **Restart Visual Studio Code and Kernel:**\n   Sometimes, simply restarting Visual Studio Code and the Jupyter kernel (if you're using Jupyter) can resolve issues related to package installations.\n\n7. **Use a Virtual Environment:**\n   If you are not already using one, consider setting up a virtual environment for your project. This ensures that package installations and configurations do not interfere with other projects. You can create and activate a virtual environment using:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `myenv\\Scripts\\activate`\n   ```\n\n   After activating the virtual environment, reinstall the necessary packages.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and display your Plotly plot successfully. If you continue to have trouble, consider checking for any specific configurations or updates related to Visual Studio Code extensions you're using."
