Using 'Pool.map()' function to distribute work simultaneously works fine in a simple function, but when I try to employ a more object-oriented approach, I encounter a PicklingError that says \"Can't pickle <type 'instancemethod'>: attribute lookup __builtin__.instancemethod failed\". The error occurs when I use the following main program:\n\n```python\nimport someClass\n\nif __name__== '__main__' :\n    sc = someClass.someClass()\n    sc.go()\n```\n\nAnd the following is the 'someClass' class:\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\n\nclass someClass(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    def f(self, x):\n        return x*x\n\n    def go(self):\n        pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=4)       \n        print pool.map(self.f, range(10))\n```\n\nWhat could be causing this problem and how can I resolve it?"

        "content": "The `PicklingError` you are encountering is due to the fact that instance methods cannot be pickled by the `multiprocessing` library, which is required for them to be passed to worker processes in a `Pool`. This is because the multiprocessing module uses the `pickle` module to serialize objects to be sent to worker processes, and instance methods are not directly pickleable.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you have a couple of options:\n\n### Option 1: Use a Static or Class Method\nConvert the method to a static method or a class method, which are pickleable. Here's how you can convert `f` to a static method:\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\n\nclass someClass(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def f(x):\n        return x*x\n\n    def go(self):\n        pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=4)\n        print(pool.map(someClass.f, range(10)))\n```\n\n### Option 2: Use a Top-Level Function\nDefine `f` as a top-level function outside the class, and pass it to the `Pool.map()` method:\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x*x\n\nclass someClass(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    def go(self):\n        pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=4)\n        print(pool.map(f, range(10)))\n```\n\n### Option 3: Use a Callable Object\nDefine a `__call__` method in your class, which makes instances of the class callable. Then, you can use the instance itself as the function to map:\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\n\nclass someClass(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    def __call__(self, x):\n        return x*x\n\n    def go(self):\n        pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=4)\n        print(pool.map(self, range(10)))\n\nif __name__== '__main__' :\n    sc = someClass()\n    sc.go()\n```\n\nEach option has its use cases, so choose the one that best fits your design. If you need to maintain state or configuration within the `someClass`, the callable object approach might be the most appropriate. Otherwise, a static method or a top-level function can simplify the code."
