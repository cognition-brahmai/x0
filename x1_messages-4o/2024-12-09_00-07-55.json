The Python code should also be capable of handling complex user inputs and queries while continuing to greet users, request their names, store and retrieve their information, and provide pertinent information. Provide a comprehensive script that exhibits the newly added feature."

        "content": "Certainly! To enhance the sentiment analysis capabilities of a chatbot, we can utilize a more sophisticated approach by leveraging advanced libraries such as `transformers` from Hugging Face, which provides state-of-the-art models for natural language processing tasks, including sentiment analysis. Additionally, we can use `NLTK` or `TextBlob` for basic NLP tasks and data handling.\n\nHere's a comprehensive Python script that demonstrates the integration of a more advanced sentiment analysis feature, along with user interaction functionalities like greeting, name handling, and information storage:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport json\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Initialize the sentiment analysis model\nsentiment_analyzer = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')\n\n# User data storage\nuser_data = {}\n\ndef greet_user():\n    greetings = [\"Hello!\", \"Hi there!\", \"Greetings!\", \"Hey!\"]\n    return random.choice(greetings)\n\ndef request_user_name():\n    return \"May I know your name, please?\"\n\ndef store_user_info(name, sentiment):\n    user_data[name] = {\n        'sentiment': sentiment,\n        'last_interaction': datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n    }\n    return f\"Nice to meet you, {name}!\"\n\ndef retrieve_user_info(name):\n    if name in user_data:\n        return f\"Welcome back, {name}! Last time we talked, you seemed {user_data[name]['sentiment']}.\"\n    else:\n        return \"I don't believe we've met before.\"\n\ndef analyze_sentiment(user_input):\n    result = sentiment_analyzer(user_input)\n    return result[0]['label'].lower()\n\ndef handle_complex_queries(user_input):\n    # Placeholder for handling complex queries\n    return \"I'm getting better at understanding complex queries. How can I assist you further?\"\n\ndef main():\n    print(greet_user())\n    print(request_user_name())\n\n    user_name = input(\"Your name: \").strip()\n\n    if user_name in user_data:\n        print(retrieve_user_info(user_name))\n    else:\n        print(store_user_info(user_name, \"neutral\"))\n\n    while True:\n        user_input = input(f\"{user_name}, how can I assist you today? (Type 'exit' to end): \").strip()\n        if user_input.lower() == 'exit':\n            print(f\"Goodbye, {user_name}! Have a great day!\")\n            break\n\n        sentiment = analyze_sentiment(user_input)\n        print(f\"It seems you're feeling {sentiment}.\")\n        store_user_info(user_name, sentiment)\n\n        response = handle_complex_queries(user_input)\n        print(response)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Key Features of the Script:\n\n1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilizes Hugging Face's `transformers` library for sophisticated sentiment analysis. It can detect a range of emotions like positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.\n\n2. **User Interaction**: Greets the user, requests their name, and stores their information in a dictionary. Retrieves user information if they return.\n\n3. **Complex Query Handling**: Placeholder function for handling complex queries, which can be expanded with additional logic as needed.\n\n4. **Persistent Data**: Stores user sentiment and last interaction time, which can be expanded to save more data or use a database for persistence.\n\n5. **Graceful Exit**: Allows the user to exit the conversation politely.\n\n### Requirements:\n\n- Python 3.x\n- Install necessary packages with:\n  ```bash\n  pip install transformers\n  ```\n\nThis script provides a foundation for building a more sophisticated chatbot. Enhance it further with additional NLP capabilities, database integration, or more personalized user interactions as needed."
