I am trying to condense the following multi-line code into a one-liner that can be executed from the command line, but I am having trouble figuring out the correct combination of semicolons and/or braces.\n\n```bash\nwhile [ 1 ]\ndo\n    foo\n    sleep 2\ndone\n```"

        "content": "To condense your multi-line `while` loop into a single line in Bash, you can use semicolons to separate the commands. Here's how you can write it:\n\n```bash\nwhile [ 1 ]; do foo; sleep 2; done\n```\n\nThis one-liner uses semicolons to separate the commands within the loop. The `do` and `done` keywords are also separated by semicolons from the surrounding commands. This format allows you to execute the loop directly from the command line."
