        "content": "To modify the Ruby code to display the percentage increase in housing expenses for an average household with an income of $60,000, you would need to calculate the change in the rent as a percentage of the household income. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```ruby\nprevPrice = 1500\ncurrPrice = 1800\nhouseholdIncome = 60000\n\npriceDiff = currPrice - prevPrice\npriceIncrease = priceDiff.to_f / prevPrice\n\n# Calculate the percentage of income spent on rent before and after the increase\nprevRentPercentage = (prevPrice * 12) / householdIncome.to_f * 100\ncurrRentPercentage = (currPrice * 12) / householdIncome.to_f * 100\n\n# Calculate the increase in rent as a percentage of income\npercentageIncreaseInHousingExpenses = currRentPercentage - prevRentPercentage\n\nif priceIncrease == 0.2\n  puts \"The average rent price in the city increased by 20%.
