For instance, I have an object list as follows:\n\n```python\nobjects = [Aobject, Bobject, Cobject]\n```\n\nwhere\n\n```python\n>>> Aobject != Bobject\nTrue\n>>> Aobject.id ==  Bobject.id\nTrue\n```\n\nI attempted to use the following code to generate the list, which unfortunately did not work:\n\n```python\nset(objects, key=operator.attrgetter('id'))\n```\n\nHow should I proceed to get the list of unique objects based on the 'id' attribute?"

        "content": "To obtain a list of unique objects based on the 'id' attribute, you can use a dictionary to map the 'id' to the object itself. This way, only the first occurrence of each unique 'id' will be stored. Here's a step-by-step approach using a dictionary comprehension:\n\n```python\n# List of objects with potentially duplicate 'id'\nobjects = [Aobject, Bobject, Cobject]\n\n# Create a dictionary with 'id' as key and the object as value\nunique_objects_dict = {obj.id: obj for obj in objects}\n\n# Extract the values of the dictionary, which are the unique objects\nunique_objects = list(unique_objects_dict.values())\n\n# 'unique_objects' now contains the list of unique objects based on 'id'\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Dictionary Comprehension**: `{obj.id: obj for obj in objects}` creates a dictionary where each key is the 'id' and each value is the corresponding object. If two objects have the same 'id', the latter one will overwrite the former in the dictionary.\n- **Extracting Values**: `list(unique_objects_dict.values())` extracts the objects from the dictionary, which are unique based on the 'id' attribute.\n\nThis solution ensures that you have a list of objects where each 'id' is unique, and it preserves the first occurrence of each unique 'id' found in the original list."
