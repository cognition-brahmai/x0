However, I've noticed that some images have an alpha channel, which gives them a shape of (200, 200, 4) instead of the expected shape, which is (200, 200, 3). How can I discard this last value, i.e., the alpha channel, and ensure that all images have a shape of (200, 200, 3)?"

Here's how you can do it using NumPy:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef remove_alpha_channel(image):\n    # Check if the image has an alpha channel\n    if image.shape[-1] == 4:\n        # Discard the alpha channel by slicing the array\n        image = image[:, :, :3]\n    return image\n\n# Example usage\n# Assume 'images' is a list of numpy arrays representing your images\nprocessed_images = [remove_alpha_channel(image) for image in images]\n```\n\nIn this code, the `remove_alpha_channel` function checks if an image has an alpha channel (i.e., its shape is (200, 200, 4)). If it does, the function slices the image to keep only the first three channels (RGB) and discards the alpha channel. This ensures all images have the shape (200, 200, 3). You can then apply this function to each image in your dataset."
