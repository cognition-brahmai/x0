I can iterate over each row of the DataFrame, add the values to a set and thereby find the unique values. However, I suspect this method may be inefficient. Is there a more efficient way to find these unique values? Does Pandas provide a pre-defined function for this?"

        "content": "Yes, Pandas provides a more efficient way to find unique values in an entire DataFrame using the `pd.unique()` function in conjunction with the `.values.ravel()` method. This approach leverages the efficiency of NumPy and avoids the need to manually iterate over each row or column. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming df is your DataFrame\nunique_values = pd.unique(df.values.ravel())\n\nprint(unique_values)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps:\n\n1. `df.values` converts the DataFrame into a NumPy array.\n2. `.ravel()` flattens this array into a one-dimensional array.\n3. `pd.unique()` then finds the unique values in this flattened array.\n\nThis method is efficient and takes advantage of Pandas and NumPy's optimized operations."
