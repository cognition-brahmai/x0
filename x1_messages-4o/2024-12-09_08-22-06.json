When the checkbox is not selected, nothing is passed, and this is when the error occurs. How can I handle this exception and catch it properly? The code where this happens is `is_private = request.POST['is_private']`."

        "content": "The `MultiValueDictKeyError` occurs because when a checkbox is not selected in an HTML form, it does not send any value in the POST data. Therefore, trying to access it directly with `request.POST['is_private']` will raise an error if the checkbox is not checked.\n\nTo handle this situation, you can use the `get` method of the `QueryDict` object (which `request.POST` is an instance of). The `get` method allows you to provide a default value if the key is not present in the dictionary. Here\u2019s how you can modify your code to handle this:\n\n```python\nis_private = request.POST.get('is_private', 'off')  # Default to 'off' if not present\n\n# Convert the value to a boolean\nis_private = True if is_private == 'on' else False\n```\n\nIn this code, `request.POST.get('is_private', 'off')` will return `'off'` if the checkbox is not checked, which you can then convert to a boolean value. The usual convention is to have `'on'` represent `True` and anything else (or absence) represent `False`, which is why `'off'` is used as a default.\n\nThis approach ensures that your code can handle the absence of the checkbox key without throwing an error. If the checkbox is checked, `is_private` will be `True`; otherwise, it will be `False`."
