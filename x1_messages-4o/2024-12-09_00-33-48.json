In the `SuperFoo` model, I have a field named `name` with a verbose name of 'name of SuperFoo instance'. I'm trying to override the verbose name of the `name` field in the `Foo` subclass. Is this possible? If not, is my best option to set a label inside the model form definition to have it displayed in a template? Here is the current code for reference:\n\n```python\nclass SuperFoo(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField('name of SuperFoo instance', max_length=50)\n    ...\n\nclass Foo(SuperFoo):\n    ... # I want to change verbose_name of name field of SuperFoo here\n```"

        "content": "In Django, when you inherit from a superclass model, the fields of the superclass are inherited as they are, including their metadata like `verbose_name`. You can't directly override the `verbose_name` of an inherited field in the subclass model definition. However, you can achieve the desired effect in a couple of ways:\n\n### Option 1: Override in the Model's Meta Class\nYou can't directly change the `verbose_name` in the subclass, but you can provide a workaround by defining a custom method to get the field label for display purposes, if that's suitable for your use case. However, this doesn't change the `verbose_name` in the admin interface or forms.\n\n### Option 2: Use a ModelForm and Override the Label\nThe most straightforward way to change the label for display purposes, such as in forms, is to use a `ModelForm` and specify the label there:\n\n```python\nfrom django import forms\n\nclass FooForm(forms.ModelForm):\n    class Meta:\n        model = Foo\n        fields = '__all__'\n        labels = {\n            'name': 'New Verbose Name for Foo Instance',\n        }\n```\n\n### Option 3: Use a Property or Method (For Display Purposes)\nIf you need to display the field with a different label in templates or views, you could use a property or a method in the `Foo` class:\n\n```python\nclass Foo(SuperFoo):\n    @property\n    def foo_name_label(self):\n        return 'New Verbose Name for Foo Instance'\n\n    def get_name_display(self):\n        return f'{self.foo_name_label}: {self.name}'\n\n    # Other fields and methods\n```\n\nThis way, you can use `get_name_display()` to show the field with the new label in your templates or views.\n\n### Option 4: Customize Admin Forms\nIf you're using Django Admin and want to change the label there, you can override the form in the admin:\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib import admin\n\nclass FooAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    form = FooForm\n\nadmin.site.register(Foo, FooAdmin)\n```\n\nThese methods allow you to work around the limitation of directly changing the `verbose_name` in a subclass. Choose the one that best fits your needs based on where and how you want the new label displayed."
