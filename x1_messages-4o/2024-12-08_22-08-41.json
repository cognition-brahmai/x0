        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer that can be represented as the sum of three distinct positive cubes in two different ways. This requires identifying combinations of three distinct cubes and checking for multiple representations.\n\n1. **Identify expressions for cubes:** The first few positive cubes are:\n   - \\(1^3 = 1\\)\n   - \\(2^3 = 8\\)\n   - \\(3^3 = 27\\)\n   - \\(4^3 = 64\\)\n   - \\(5^3 = 125\\)\n   - \\(6^3 = 216\\)\n   - \\(7^3 = 343\\)\n   - \\(8^3 = 512\\)\n   - \\(9^3 = 729\\)\n   - \\(10^3 = 1000\\)\n   - etc.\n\n2. **Find sums of three distinct cubes:** Calculate sums of three distinct cubes and look for repeated values.\n\n3. **Check smaller sums first:** Start with smaller cubes and increase. We want two different sets of three cubes that sum to the same value.\n\n4. **Work systematically:** Consider combinations of cubes from smallest to larger ones and compute their sums.\n\nLet's start checking:\n\n- For \\(x^3 + y^3 + z^3\\) where \\(x < y < z\\).\n\n  By calculating a few combinations, we find:\n\n  - \\(1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 8 + 27 = 36\\)\n  - \\(1^3 + 4^3 + 5^3 = 1 + 64 + 125 = 190\\)\n  - \\(2^3 + 3^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 27 + 216 = 251\\)\n  - \\(3^3 + 4^3 + 5^3 = 27 + 64 + 125 = 216\\)\n  - \\(3^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 27 + 216 + 512 = 755\\)\n  - \\(4^3 + 5^3 + 6^3 = 64 + 125 + 216 = 405\\)\n  - \\(5^3 + 6^3 + 7^3 = 125 + 216 + 343 = 684\\)\n  - \\(6^3 + 7^3 + 8^3 = 216 + 343 + 512 = 1071\\)\n\n5. **Identify smallest repeated sum:** Continue this process until you find two sets that yield the same sum.\n\nThrough this checking process, we find:\n\n- \\(1^3 + 2^3 + 10^3 = 1 + 8 + 1000 = 1009\\)\n- \\(6^3 + 8^3 + 9^3 = 216 + 512 + 729 = 1457\\)\n\nActually, it turns out that \\(1^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 1 + 216 + 512 = 729\\) and also \\(9^3 = 729\\) provides a repeated sum through different combinations.\n\n- **Smallest sum with two representations:**\n  - \\(1^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 1 + 216 + 512 = 729\\)\n  - \\(9^3 = 729\\)\n\nThus, the smallest positive integer that can be represented as the sum of three distinct positive cubes in two different ways is 729."
