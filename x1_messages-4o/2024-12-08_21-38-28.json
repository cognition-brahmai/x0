The matrix \"data\" contains the following information: \n    'Pineapple'    5     2.99\n    'Watermelon'   8     3.99\n    'Grapes'       7     1.99"

Below is a MATLAB code snippet that sorts a matrix called `data` based on the sweetness levels in ascending order and then prints the sorted matrix.\n\n```matlab\n% Define the cell array with fruit data\ndata = {\n    'Pineapple', 5, 2.99;\n    'Watermelon', 8, 3.99;\n    'Grapes', 7, 1.99\n};\n\n% Extract the sweetness levels (second column)\nsweetnessLevels = cell2mat(data(:, 2));\n\n% Sort the sweetness levels and get the sorting indices\n[~, sortIdx] = sort(sweetnessLevels);\n\n% Use the sorting indices to sort the entire matrix\nsortedData = data(sortIdx, :);\n\n% Display the sorted matrix\ndisp('Sorted matrix based on sweetness levels:');\ndisp(sortedData);\n```\n\nThis code will output the matrix sorted based on the sweetness levels in ascending order. The `sort` function is used to obtain the indices required to reorder the rows of the `data` matrix."
