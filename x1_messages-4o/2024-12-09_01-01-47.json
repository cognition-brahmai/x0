Here's how you can translate the given C code into Python:\n\n```python\ndef there_is_a_reason_to_break(i):\n    # Define your condition here\n    return False  # Replace this with your actual condition\n\ni = 0\nwhile True:\n    # Do something with i\n    if there_is_a_reason_to_break(i):\n        break\n    i += 1\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We initialize `i` to 0.\n- We use a `while True` loop to create an infinite loop.\n- Inside the loop, we check if there is a reason to break using the function `there_is_a_reason_to_break(i)`. If the condition is met, we break out of the loop.\n- We increment `i` by 1 after each iteration. \n\nYou need to define the `there_is_a_reason_to_break` function to specify the condition under which the loop should terminate."
