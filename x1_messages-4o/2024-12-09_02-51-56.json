        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the way backslashes (`\\`) are interpreted in Python string literals. Backslashes are used to escape special characters, and in your path, the sequence `\\U` is being interpreted as the start of a Unicode escape sequence, which is causing the error.\n\nThere are a few ways to correctly specify file paths in Python to avoid this issue:\n\n1. **Use Raw Strings**: Precede the string with an `r` to make it a raw string, which tells Python not to treat backslashes as escape characters.\n\n    ```python\n    data = open(r\"C:\\Users\\miche\\Documents\\school\\jaar2\\MIK\\2.6\\vektis_agb_zorgverlener.csv\")\n    ```\n\n2. **Escape Backslashes**: Double the backslashes to escape them.\n\n    ```python\n    data = open(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\miche\\\\Documents\\\\school\\\\jaar2\\\\MIK\\\\2.6\\\\vektis_agb_zorgverlener.csv\")\n    ```\n\n3. **Use Forward Slashes**: Python on Windows can also interpret forward slashes in paths.\n\n    ```python\n    data = open(\"C:/Users/miche/Documents/school/jaar2/MIK/2.6/vektis_agb_zorgverlener.csv\")\n    ```\n\nAdditionally, ensure that the file name includes the correct extension (`.csv` in this case).\n\nAfter fixing the path, you should also modify your code to read the contents of the CSV file and print it in a more meaningful way:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\nwith open(r\"C:\\Users\\miche\\Documents\\school\\jaar2\\MIK\\2.6\\vektis_agb_zorgverlener.csv\", newline='') as data:\n    reader = csv.reader(data)\n    for row in reader:\n        print(row)\n```\n\nUsing `with open(...)` is generally recommended as it ensures that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised."
