In this case, the verb should be \"believe\" instead of \"believes\". Here's a Ruby code snippet to achieve this:\n\n```ruby\n# Define the sentence\nsentence = \"They don't believes in ghosts.\"\n\n# Correct the grammar\ncorrected_sentence = sentence.gsub(\"don't believes\", \"don't believe\")\n\n# Output the corrected sentence\nputs corrected_sentence\n```\n\nThis script uses the `gsub` method to replace the incorrect phrase \"don't believes\" with the correct phrase \"don't believe\". When you run this Ruby script, it will output the corrected sentence:\n\n```\nThey don't believe in ghosts.\n```"
