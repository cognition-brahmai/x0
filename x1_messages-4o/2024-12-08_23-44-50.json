I want to sort the set in lexicographical order. How can I do it using Python code? Can you help me with the implementation?\nHere is the code I tried, but it's not working:\nfruits = {\"apples\", \"bananas\", \"pears\", \"oranges\"}\nfruits.sort()\nprint(fruits)\nIt's giving me an error \"AttributeError: 'set' object has no attribute 'sort'\".

        "content": "Certainly! The issue you're facing is because sets in Python are unordered collections, and they don't have a `sort()` method. To sort the elements of a set in lexicographical order, you can first convert the set to a list, sort the list, and then work with the sorted list. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Your original set of fruits\nfruits = {\"apples\", \"bananas\", \"pears\", \"oranges\"}\n\n# Convert the set to a list\nfruits_list = list(fruits)\n\n# Sort the list\nfruits_list.sort()\n\n# Print the sorted list\nprint(fruits_list)\n```\n\nThis code will output the list of fruit names sorted in lexicographical order:\n\n```\n['apples', 'bananas', 'oranges', 'pears']\n```\n\nBy converting the set to a list, you can take advantage of the list's `sort()` method to get the elements in the desired order."
