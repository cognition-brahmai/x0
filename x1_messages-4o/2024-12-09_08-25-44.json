If the number is 2, I would like it to output \"2nd\", and so on. This is specifically for working with dates in a breadcrumb trail. Currently, it shows as:\n\nHome > Venues > Bar Academy > 2009 > April > 01\n\nI would like to change it to:\n\nHome > Venues > Bar Academy > 2009 > April > 1st"

        "content": "To convert numbers to their ordinal representations in Python, you can create a simple function to handle this. Here's a quick and easy way to achieve that:\n\n```python\ndef ordinal(n):\n    suffix = ['th', 'st', 'nd', 'rd', 'th', 'th', 'th', 'th', 'th', 'th']\n    if 10 <= n % 100 <= 20:\n        suffix_index = 0\n    else:\n        suffix_index = n % 10\n    return str(n) + suffix[suffix_index]\n\n# Example usage:\nbreadcrumb_trail = \"Home > Venues > Bar Academy > 2009 > April > \"\ndate = 1\nformatted_date = ordinal(date)\nbreadcrumb_trail += formatted_date\n\nprint(breadcrumb_trail)\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n- The function `ordinal` takes an integer `n` as input.\n- It determines the appropriate suffix using a list `suffix` that contains possible suffixes for numbers 0 through 9.\n- It checks for numbers ending in 11, 12, or 13 separately since they are exceptions to the general rule (`10 <= n % 100 <= 20`).\n- It appends the correct suffix to the number and returns the ordinal string.\n\nYou can use this function to convert any number to its ordinal representation, and incorporate it into your breadcrumb trail as shown in the example usage."
