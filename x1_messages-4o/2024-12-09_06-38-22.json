        "content": "I am attempting to plot multiple scatter plots using pandas. The pandas documentation suggests that I 'repeat the plot method' to plot multiple column groups in a single axis. However, I am unsure of how to do this for three or more column groups. For instance, if I define a third column as shown in the code below:\n\n```python\nbx = df.plot(kind='scatter', x='a', y='f', color='Green', label='f')\n```\n\nwhere would I pass this 'bx' into? Additionally, if the plot is on the same graph, shouldn't the x-axis be consistently either 'a' or 'c'? The documentation, however, shows two different x-axes: 'a' and 'c'."

        "content": "To plot multiple scatter plots on the same axis using pandas, you can specify each scatter plot and pass the axis of the previous plot to the next plot using the `ax` parameter. This way, all the scatter plots will be drawn on the same figure.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'a': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n    'b': [5, 4, 3, 2, 1],\n    'c': [2, 3, 4, 5, 6],\n    'd': [1, 3, 5, 7, 9],\n    'e': [9, 7, 5, 3, 1],\n    'f': [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# First scatter plot\nax = df.plot(kind='scatter', x='a', y='b', color='Red', label='b')\n\n# Second scatter plot on the same axis\ndf.plot(kind='scatter', x='a', y='d', color='Blue', label='d', ax=ax)\n\n# Third scatter plot on the same axis\ndf.plot(kind='scatter', x='a', y='f', color='Green', label='f', ax=ax)\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- We create three scatter plots, all using 'a' as the x-axis for consistency.\n- The `ax` parameter is used to pass the axis of the previous plot to the next plot, ensuring they all appear on the same graph.\n- Each scatter plot is labeled differently for clarity.\n\nIf you want to use different x-axes for different plots, you can still use the same approach but specify different columns for the x-axis in each call. However, for a consistent comparison, using the same x-axis is usually more meaningful in a single plot."
