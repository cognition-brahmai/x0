Here is what I have tried so far:\n\n```R\nmodel = lm(y~x,data=training_set)\ntrain_MSE = mean(model$residuals^2)\ntest_MSE = ? # How do I calculate this?\n```\n\nI am not sure how to calculate the test MSE. Could you assist me with this?"

        "content": "To calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the test data using the model you've trained on the training data, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Use the model to predict the `y` values for the `x` values in the test set.\n2. Calculate the residuals, which are the differences between the actual `y` values in the test set and the predicted `y` values.\n3. Compute the MSE by taking the mean of the squared residuals.\n\nHere's how you can do it in R:\n\n```R\n# Fit the linear model on the training set\nmodel <- lm(y ~ x, data = training_set)\n\n# Predict the y values for the test set\npredicted_values <- predict(model, newdata = test_set)\n\n# Calculate the residuals (actual - predicted)\nresiduals <- test_set$y - predicted_values\n\n# Calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for the test set\ntest_MSE <- mean(residuals^2)\n\n# Print the test MSE\nprint(test_MSE)\n```\n\nThis code will give you the MSE for the test data, which is a measure of how well your model performs on unseen data."
