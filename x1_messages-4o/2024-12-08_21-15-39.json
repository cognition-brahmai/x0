        "content": "To calculate the performance metrics for a professional sports team using the given data, you can use the following C++ code. This code will calculate the shot accuracy percentage, corner kick success rate, and penalty conversion rate, rounding the results to two decimal places.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <iomanip> // for std::setprecision\n\nint main() {\n    // Given data\n    int totalGoals = 16;\n    int totalShots = 100;\n    int totalShotsOnTarget = 60;\n    int totalCornerKicks = 20;\n    int totalPenalties = 3;\n\n    // Calculating the performance metrics\n\n    // Shot accuracy percentage: (shots on target / total shots) * 100\n    double shotAccuracy = (static_cast<double>(totalShotsOnTarget) / totalShots) * 100;\n\n    // Assuming corner kick success rate is the number of goals scored from corner kicks\n    // Divided by total corner kicks taken (this data is assumed as not provided)\n    // For the sake of calculation, let's assume 3 goals were from corner kicks\n    int goalsFromCorners = 3; // assumed value\n    double cornerKickSuccessRate = (static_cast<double>(goalsFromCorners) / totalCornerKicks) * 100;\n\n    // Penalty conversion rate: (goals from penalties / total penalties) * 100\n    // Assuming 2 goals were scored from penalties\n    int goalsFromPenalties = 2; // assumed value\n    double penaltyConversionRate = (static_cast<double>(goalsFromPenalties) / totalPenalties) * 100;\n\n    // Output the results with two decimal precision\n    std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(2);\n    std::cout << \"Shot Accuracy Percentage: \" << shotAccuracy << \"%\" << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Corner Kick Success Rate: \" << cornerKickSuccessRate << \"%\" << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Penalty Conversion Rate: \" << penaltyConversionRate << \"%\" << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Shot Accuracy Percentage**: This is calculated by dividing the total number of shots on target by the total number of shots, then multiplying by 100 to convert it to a percentage.\n\n2. **Corner Kick Success Rate**: Since the number of goals scored directly from corner kicks isn't provided, we must assume a value. In this example, it's assumed that 3 goals were scored from corner kicks. This metric is calculated by dividing the number of goals from corners by the total number of corner kicks, then multiplying by 100.\n\n3. **Penalty Conversion Rate**: This is calculated by dividing the number of goals scored from penalties by the total number of penalties taken, then multiplying by 100. Again, since the data isn't provided, an assumed value is used (2 goals from penalties).\n\nMake sure to adjust the assumed values based on the actual data if it's available."
