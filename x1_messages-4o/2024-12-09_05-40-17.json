Code is as follows:\n\n```python\na = [1,2,3,4,5]\na[2:4] = reversed(a[2:4])  # This works!\na[2:4] = [0,0]             # This works too.\na[2:4].reverse()           # But this doesn't work\n```\nWhy does the last line of code not work?"

        "content": "In Python, the `reverse()` method is an in-place operation that modifies the list it is called on and returns `None`. However, when you use slicing like `a[2:4]`, it creates a new list object that is a copy of that slice, and applying `reverse()` to this new list does not affect the original list `a`.\n\nHere's a breakdown of your code:\n\n1. `a[2:4] = reversed(a[2:4])` works because `reversed(a[2:4])` returns an iterator that produces the elements of the slice in reverse order, and you assign this reversed iterator back to the original list slice `a[2:4]`.\n\n2. `a[2:4] = [0,0]` works because you are directly assigning a new list to the slice `a[2:4]`.\n\n3. `a[2:4].reverse()` doesn't work as expected because `a[2:4]` creates a copy of that slice, and calling `reverse()` on the copy does not affect the original list `a`.\n\nTo reverse a part of the list in place, you need to directly assign the reversed slice back to that portion of the list. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\na = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\na[2:4] = a[2:4][::-1]  # Reverse the slice and assign it back\n```\n\nThis code uses slicing with `[::-1]` to reverse the sublist and assigns it back to the original list slice `a[2:4]`."
