Both environments have separate official websites, but there seems to be only one code without version identification in the gym github repository. Also, upon checking what files are loaded via the debugger, they both seem to load the same file. The only apparent difference is in their internally assigned `max_episode_steps` and `reward_threshold`, with CartPole-v0 having the values 200/195.0 and CartPole-v1 having the values 500/475.0. Can someone provide a detailed explanation of the differences between these two environments or provide a resource that does?"

        "content": "The primary differences between the 'CartPole-v0' and 'CartPole-v1' environments in OpenAI Gym are indeed the `max_episode_steps` and `reward_threshold` parameters, as you have noted. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **Max Episode Steps**:\n   - **CartPole-v0**: The episode terminates after 200 steps. This means that even if the pole is balanced perfectly, the maximum length of an episode is 200 time steps.\n   - **CartPole-v1**: The episode can last up to 500 steps. This allows for longer episodes where the pole can be balanced for a longer duration.\n\n2. **Reward Threshold**:\n   - **CartPole-v0**: The reward threshold for considering the task solved is 195.0 over 100 consecutive episodes. This means to consider the CartPole-v0 environment as solved, your agent needs to achieve an average reward of 195 over 100 episodes.\n   - **CartPole-v1**: The reward threshold is higher at 475.0 over 100 consecutive episodes. This reflects the increased maximum steps and expects the agent to maintain balance for a longer time.\n\nThese adjustments in parameters reflect differences in the difficulty and the expectations for what constitutes a \"solved\" environment. The underlying dynamics, such as physics and actions, remain the same between the two versions. The change in episode length and reward threshold essentially makes CartPole-v1 a more challenging version of the problem, requiring the agent to maintain balance for a longer period.\n\nBoth environments share the same underlying codebase, which is why they load the same files when you run them. The difference in `max_episode_steps` and `reward_threshold` is configured through the Gym registration process, which assigns these parameters when the environment is created. \n\nThese changes are designed to provide a more extended challenge for algorithms that successfully solve CartPole-v0 and want to test their robustness on a longer-duration task with the same dynamics."
