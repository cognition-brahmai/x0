I had assumed that the order would remain constant, i.e., the same as the order in which they were added to the database, even without using 'order_by'. However, I found this assumption to be incorrect when the order of the returned list changed unknowingly. This happened even though none of the records were touched and I am the only person who maintains the DB. The issue adds to confusion as the order remains consistent on Mac OS X, but changes on Win XP. The query used is `required_tests = Card_Test.objects.using(get_database()).filter(name__icontains=key)`. I could not find any documentation in Django or PostgreSQL that explains the difference in behaviour between the operating systems."

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is due to how SQL databases handle ordering in queries. When you perform a query in Django using the `.filter()` method without specifying an `.order_by()`, the database is free to return the results in any order it deems efficient. This means the order of objects returned can vary between queries, database versions, or even operating systems, as you're experiencing.\n\nPostgreSQL, like many SQL databases, does not guarantee a specific order for rows returned by a query unless an `ORDER BY` clause is explicitly specified. This is because the database engine optimizes query execution, and the optimization strategies can lead to different result ordering. These strategies can vary based on system architecture, operating system, or the database's internal state.\n\nThe consistent ordering you observed on Mac OS X and the varying order on Windows XP are likely due to differences in how PostgreSQL's query planner optimizes queries on different systems. This can include differences in how data is stored on disk, memory management, or even the version of PostgreSQL being used.\n\nTo ensure a consistent order of results across all environments, you should explicitly specify an order using the `.order_by()` clause in your Django query. For example, if you want to order by the primary key or the date created, you could modify your query like this:\n\n```python\nrequired_tests = Card_Test.objects.using(get_database()).filter(name__icontains=key).order_by('id')\n```\n\nor\n\n```python\nrequired_tests = Card_Test.objects.using(get_database()).filter(name__icontains=key).order_by('created_at')\n```\n\nBy specifying an order, you ensure that the results are returned in a predictable manner, regardless of the underlying database or operating system."
