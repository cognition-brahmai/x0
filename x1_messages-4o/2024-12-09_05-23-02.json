Can you guide me on the correct way to set the timezone to UTC+2 in Django?"

        "content": "In Django, the `TIME_ZONE` setting does not directly support offset-based timezones like 'UTC+2'. Instead, you should use a recognized timezone name from the IANA Time Zone Database. For UTC+2, you typically use a region-based timezone that corresponds to the desired offset.\n\nOne commonly used timezone for UTC+2 is 'Europe/Berlin'. You can set this in your `settings.py` file like this:\n\n```python\nTIME_ZONE = 'Europe/Berlin'\n```\n\nIf you are looking for a timezone that is consistently UTC+2 all year round (not affected by daylight saving time), you might want to use 'Africa/Johannesburg':\n\n```python\nTIME_ZONE = 'Africa/Johannesburg'\n```\n\nChoose the one that best fits your requirements based on whether or not you need to account for daylight saving changes. Remember to restart your Django application after making changes to `settings.py` for them to take effect."
