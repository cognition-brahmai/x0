        "content": "Certainly! To solve this problem with a time complexity of \\( O(n) \\), we can use a simple sliding window approach. We will iterate over each character in the longer string \"str\" and check if the substring starting at that character matches the \"target\" string. Here's how you can implement it in C++:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n\nint countOccurrences(const std::string& str, const std::string& target) {\n    int count = 0;\n    int n = str.length();\n    int m = target.length();\n\n    // If target is longer than str, no occurrence is possible\n    if (m > n) return 0;\n\n    // Iterate over the string with a sliding window approach\n    for (int i = 0; i <= n - m; ++i) {\n        bool match = true;\n        // Check if the substring starting at i matches the target\n        for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {\n            if (str[i + j] != target[j]) {\n                match = false;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        if (match) {\n            ++count;\n        }\n    }\n    return count;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::string str = \"abababab\";\n    std::string target = \"ab\";\n\n    int occurrences = countOccurrences(str, target);\n    std::cout << \"The target string \\\"\" << target << \"\\\" occurs \" << occurrences << \" times in the string \\\"\" << str << \"\\\".\" << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We start by checking if the target string's length is greater than the longer string's length. If so, it's impossible for the target to occur within the string, and we return 0.\n- We use a loop to iterate over the string \"str\" with a window that matches the size of the \"target\".\n- For each position in \"str\", we check if the substring starting at that position matches the \"target\".\n- If it matches, we increment the count.\n- The loop continues until we have checked all possible starting positions for the target within \"str\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we only pass over the string once for each character, resulting in a time complexity of \\( O(n) \\), where \\( n \\) is the length of the string \"str\"."
