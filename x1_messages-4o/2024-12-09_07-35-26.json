The error seems to be arising from my function `load_words()`. How can I modify this code to avoid the ValueError and make it compatible with Python 3.x?\n\nHere is the code I'm working with:\n\n```python\nWORDLIST_FILENAME = \"words.txt\"\n\ndef load_words():\n\n    print(\"Loading word list from file...\")\n\n    inFile = open(WORDLIST_FILENAME, 'r', 0)\n    # wordlist: list of strings\n    wordlist = []\n    for line in inFile:\n        wordlist.append(line.strip().lower())\n    print(\"  \", len(wordlist), \"words loaded.\")\n    return wordlist\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the use of unbuffered text I/O in Python 3, which is not allowed. The third argument (`0`) in the `open` function call is specifying an unbuffered mode, which is valid in Python 2 but not in Python 3 for text files. In Python 3, you can use buffering options in binary mode but not in text mode.\n\nHere's how you can modify your `load_words()` function to be compatible with Python 3:\n\n```python\nWORDLIST_FILENAME = \"words.txt\"\n\ndef load_words():\n    print(\"Loading word list from file...\")\n\n    # Open the file without specifying buffering for text mode\n    with open(WORDLIST_FILENAME, 'r') as inFile:\n        # Use a list comprehension to read and process all lines\n        wordlist = [line.strip().lower() for line in inFile]\n\n    print(\"  \", len(wordlist), \"words loaded.\")\n    return wordlist\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Removed Unbuffered Mode**: Removed the third argument (`0`) from the `open` function, as it's not needed in text mode in Python 3.\n2. **Use of `with` Statement**: Using the `with` statement to open the file ensures that it's properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an error occurs.\n3. **List Comprehension**: This is a more Pythonic way to read and process lines from a file, making the code cleaner and often more efficient.\n\nThis should resolve the `ValueError` and make your code compatible with Python 3.x."
