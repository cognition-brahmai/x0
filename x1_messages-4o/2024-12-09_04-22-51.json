I am also using the bottle framework. Does this affect the logging process in any way?"

        "content": "To log Python `print` statements in Gunicorn, you can take advantage of Gunicorn's ability to inherit standard input/output. Since you've already included the `--enable-stdio-inheritance` option in your Procfile, your setup should generally work to capture `print` statements. However, there are a few additional considerations to ensure everything functions as expected:\n\n1. **Environment Configuration**: Make sure your environment is configured correctly, so that Gunicorn is running with the expected settings for logging and standard output redirection.\n\n2. **Python Buffering**: Python's `print` function may be buffered, which means output could be delayed. You can run your Python application in unbuffered mode by setting the `PYTHONUNBUFFERED` environment variable to `1`. This ensures that prints are flushed immediately.\n\n    ```bash\n    export PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1\n    ```\n\n    Alternatively, you can start your Python application with the `-u` option to force unbuffered output:\n\n    ```bash\n    python -u app.py\n    ```\n\n3. **Logging Configuration**: While `print` statements can be useful for quick debugging, consider using Python's built-in logging module, which offers more control over log levels and output destinations. You can configure the logging module to output to the console, which will be captured by Gunicorn:\n\n    ```python\n    import logging\n\n    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\n    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n    logger.debug(\"This is a debug message\")\n    ```\n\n4. **Bottle Framework**: The Bottle framework itself shouldn't inherently affect the logging of `print` statements, but ensure that Bottle's logging is configured to send logs to stdout, if you're using any of its logging features.\n\n5. **Docker and Procfile**: If you're using Docker, ensure that your container is set up to forward stdout and stderr correctly. In a Procfile-based setup, ensure that the web process is set to run the Gunicorn command exactly as needed.\n\nBy following these steps, your Python `print` statements should be logged to stdout and visible in your bash console. If you continue to experience issues, check for any additional configurations or environment variables that might be affecting output."
