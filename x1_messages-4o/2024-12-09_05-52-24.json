The command nvidia-smi works perfectly outside the container and inside containers created from the nvidia/cuda Docker image. However, in any other Docker container, the CUDA version shows as N/A and the function torch.cuda.is_available() returns false. I have installed nvidia-container-toolkit and started my containers using certain commands. How can I solve this problem?"

        "content": "To effectively utilize the GPU inside your Docker container, you need to ensure that the NVIDIA runtime is correctly set up and that your container is configured to use it. Here's a step-by-step guide to troubleshoot and solve the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure NVIDIA Container Toolkit is Installed:**\n   - Make sure the `nvidia-container-toolkit` is properly installed on your system. You can verify this by running:\n     ```bash\n     dpkg -l | grep nvidia-container-toolkit\n     ```\n   - If it's not installed, you can install it using the following commands:\n     ```bash\n     distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID)\n     curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -\n     curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list\n     sudo apt-get update\n     sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit\n     sudo systemctl restart docker\n     ```\n\n2. **Configure the Docker Daemon:**\n   - Ensure that the Docker daemon is configured to use the NVIDIA runtime by default. Add or modify the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file to include:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"runtimes\": {\n         \"nvidia\": {\n           \"path\": \"nvidia-container-runtime\",\n           \"runtimeArgs\": []\n         }\n       }\n     }\n     ```\n   - Restart the Docker service after making changes:\n     ```bash\n     sudo systemctl restart docker\n     ```\n\n3. **Run the Container with NVIDIA Runtime:**\n   - When starting your Docker container, make sure to specify the NVIDIA runtime. Use the following command structure:\n     ```bash\n     docker run --gpus all -it --rm <your-docker-image> /bin/bash\n     ```\n   - The `--gpus all` flag ensures that all GPUs are available to the container.\n\n4. **CUDA and PyTorch Installation:**\n   - Inside the Docker container, ensure that CUDA and PyTorch are correctly installed. You can use a base image like `nvidia/cuda` to ensure compatibility.\n   - Make sure PyTorch is installed with CUDA support. You can verify this inside the container with:\n     ```python\n     import torch\n     print(torch.cuda.is_available())\n     ```\n\n5. **Check Environment Variables:**\n   - Ensure that the necessary environment variables are set in your Dockerfile or at runtime. This might include:\n     ```bash\n     export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH\n     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to utilize the GPU inside your Docker container effectively. If you continue to face issues, consider checking the compatibility of the driver versions between your host system and the container."
