Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n1. `for i in range(50)`: This line initializes a loop that will iterate over a sequence of numbers generated by `range(50)`. The `range(50)` function generates numbers starting from 0 up to, but not including, 50.\n\n2. `print(i)`: Within the loop, this line prints the current value of `i` to the console. Since `i` takes on each value from the range starting at 0 and ending at 49, each of these numbers will be printed.\n\nAs a result, when this code is executed, it will output the numbers 0 through 49, each on a new line."
