Similarly, `1. real` and `1 ..real` also yield syntax errors whereas `1 . real` and `1.. real` do not. Why is this happening? Here is the code and the accompanying error messages for reference:\n\n```\n>>> 1.real\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1\n    1.real\n         ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n>>> 1 .real\n1\n>>> 1. real\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1\n    1. real\n          ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n>>> 1 . real\n1\n>>> 1..real\n1.0\n>>> 1 ..real\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1\n    1 ..real\n       ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n>>> 1.. real\n1.0\n>>> 1 .. real\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1\n    1 .. real\n       ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n```"

        "content": "This behavior in Python is due to how the interpreter parses the syntax. Let's break down each case:\n\n1. **`1.real`**:\n   - This throws a syntax error because the parser expects a float number after the period (`.`) when a number is immediately followed by a dot. It interprets this as an attempt to write a floating-point literal without a fractional part, which is invalid syntax.\n\n2. **`1 .real`**:\n   - Here, the space before `.real` changes the interpretation. The `1` is parsed as an integer, and `.real` accesses the real part of `1` when interpreted as a complex number. In Python, integers (and floats) have a `.real` attribute, which is the number itself.\n\n3. **`1. real`**:\n   - Similar to `1.real`, this is invalid because after a decimal point, the interpreter expects either digits or no space before accessing an attribute or method. Thus, it sees `1.` as an incomplete floating-point number.\n\n4. **`1 . real`**:\n   - This works the same way as `1 .real`. The space allows the parser to interpret `1` as an integer, and then it accesses the `.real` attribute.\n\n5. **`1..real`**:\n   - Here, `1.` is interpreted as a floating-point number `1.0`. The second dot is used to access the `.real` attribute of the float `1.0`. Hence, it returns `1.0`.\n\n6. **`1 ..real`**:\n   - This causes a syntax error because the two dots with a space suggest an incomplete floating-point number followed by an attribute access, which is not valid.\n\n7. **`1.. real`**:\n   - Similar to `1..real`, `1.` is recognized as the float `1.0`, and `real` accesses its real part.\n\n8. **`1 .. real`**:\n   - This again results in a syntax error for the same reason as `1 ..real`, with the interpreter unable to parse it correctly as a float followed by an attribute.\n\nIn summary, the spacing affects how the interpreter parses the numbers and attribute accesses, causing the differences in behavior. The key issue is the ambiguity in the syntax when the number is immediately followed by a dot without any space."
