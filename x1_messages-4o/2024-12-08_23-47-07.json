The total number of fruits in the basket is 18. \n- If you take away 2 apples and 3 bananas, the remaining fruits weigh 15 pounds. \n- If you take away 4 oranges and 1 banana, the remaining fruits weigh 10 pounds. \n- If you take away 1 apple, 2 bananas, and 2 oranges, the remaining fruits weigh 8 pounds. \nWhat is the total weight of all the bananas in the basket?\nHint: Let A be the number of apples, B be the number of bananas, and C be the number of oranges. You can create a system of linear equations based on the given information and solve for A, B, and C."

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let \\( A \\) be the number of apples, \\( B \\) be the number of bananas, and \\( C \\) be the number of oranges. We also define \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) as the weights of one apple, one banana, and one orange, respectively.\n\nFirst, we know the total number of fruits in the basket:\n\n\\[ A + B + C = 18 \\]\n\nNext, we can set up equations based on the weight information:\n\n1. If you take away 2 apples and 3 bananas, the remaining fruits weigh 15 pounds:\n\n   \\[ (A - 2)a + (B - 3)b + Cc = 15 \\]\n\n2. If you take away 4 oranges and 1 banana, the remaining fruits weigh 10 pounds:\n\n   \\[ Aa + (B - 1)b + (C - 4)c = 10 \\]\n\n3. If you take away 1 apple, 2 bananas, and 2 oranges, the remaining fruits weigh 8 pounds:\n\n   \\[ (A - 1)a + (B - 2)b + (C - 2)c = 8 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of equations to solve:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1. & \\quad A + B + C = 18 \\\\\n2. & \\quad (A - 2)a + (B - 3)b + Cc = 15 \\\\\n3. & \\quad Aa + (B - 1)b + (C - 4)c = 10 \\\\\n4. & \\quad (A - 1)a + (B - 2)b + (C - 2)c = 8 \n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nOur goal is to find the total weight of all the bananas, which is \\( Bb \\).\n\nTo solve this, we'll need to express the weights in terms of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\). However, we do not have enough information to determine the individual weights \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) without additional information or assumptions.\n\nInstead, let's assume some reasonable values for the weights and solve for the total weight of the bananas based on the system of equations. Alternatively, if more specific information about the weights of the fruits is available, we can use that to find \\( Bb \\).\n\nSince we cannot determine the exact values of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) with the given data, providing a numerical answer for the total weight of all bananas isn't possible without further assumptions or data."
