        "content": "Certainly! An anagram is when two strings can be rearranged to form each other. To check if two strings are anagrams, you can use the following algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\ndef are_anagrams(str1, str2):\n    # First, remove any whitespace and convert both strings to lowercase.\n    str1 = str1.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n    str2 = str2.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n    \n    # If the lengths of the strings are not the same, they can't be anagrams.\n    if len(str1) != len(str2):\n        return False\n    \n    # Sort both strings and compare them.\n    return sorted(str1) == sorted(str2)\n\n# Example usage:\nstring1 = \"listen\"\nstring2 = \"silent\"\n\nif are_anagrams(string1, string2):\n    print(f'\"{string1}\" and \"{string2}\" are anagrams.')\nelse:\n    print(f'\"{string1}\" and \"{string2}\" are not anagrams.')\n```\n\nThis algorithm works by first normalizing the strings (removing spaces and converting to lowercase), then checking if their sorted character sequences match. If they do, the strings are anagrams; otherwise, they are not."
