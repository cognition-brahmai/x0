        "content": "Should the attention weights of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) over variable length sequences be re-normalized to mask the effects of zero-padding? I am referring to self-attention as described in Hierarchical Attention Networks for Document Classification and implemented in many places. While I am not specifically referring to the seq2seq type of attention used in encoder-decoder models, my question might apply to them too. When there are variable length sequences in the same batch, they will typically be zero-padded to the length of the longest sequence in the batch. When the attention weights are computed for each sequence, the final step is a softmax, so the attention weights sum to 1. However, it seems that there is no care taken to mask out, or otherwise cancel, the effects of the zero-padding on the attention weights. This seems wrong to me. For example, consider a sequence of length 2, zero-padded to length 5. This leads to the attention weights being computed as the softmax of a similarly 0-padded vector. However, the zero-padding in effect waters down the attention weights. I have found that by multiplying the weights with a binary mask and then re-normalizing the weights to sum to 1, I almost always see a performance boost. Why is this not a common practice?"

        "content": "Your observation is insightful and touches on a nuanced aspect of working with attention mechanisms in models like RNNs, especially when dealing with variable-length sequences that require padding.\n\nWhen sequences are padded with zeros, the attention mechanism, as it is typically implemented, does not inherently distinguish between meaningful data and padding. The softmax function will distribute attention across all positions, including those that are simply padding, which can indeed dilute the attention given to the actual content of the sequence. This can lead to suboptimal performance as the model might not focus adequately on the pertinent parts of the input.\n\nThe approach you are using\u2014applying a binary mask to the attention weights and re-normalizing them\u2014effectively ensures that attention is only paid to the actual sequence data, not the padding. This masked attention mechanism is more aligned with the intention behind attention models, which is to focus on and extract relevant features from the input.\n\nThe reason why this isn't universally implemented in all models could be historical or due to simplicity in initial implementations. In many cases, especially with early implementations of attention mechanisms, the focus was on demonstrating the utility of attention, and padding effects might not have been thoroughly addressed or may have been considered negligible for certain datasets or tasks.\n\nHowever, as more complex and varied datasets have been used, and as the importance of maximizing model performance has become clearer, practices like masking have gained traction. In more recent architectures, such as the Transformer models, applying attention masks is a standard practice, precisely to address the issue you're describing.\n\nTherefore, your approach is not only valid but is increasingly recognized as a best practice in scenarios where variable-length sequences with padding are involved. It ensures that the model's attention mechanism functions optimally by focusing solely on meaningful input data."
