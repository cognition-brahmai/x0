I have a git repository with several folders and one of them is a Python module that can be installed with pip. The structure of my repository is like this:\n\n<pre><code>repo.git/\nrepo.git/folder1/\nrepo.git/folder2/\nrepo.git/mymodule/\nrepo.git/mymodule/__init__.py\nrepo.git/mymodule/setup.py\nrepo.git/mymodule/...\n</code></pre>\n\nCurrently, I have to clone the repository, change into the repository directory, install the module using pip, then delete the cloned repository:\n\n<pre><code>git clone http://server/repo.git\ncd repo\npip install mymodule\ncd ..\nrm -rf repo\n</code></pre>\n\nI tried to install the module directly using pip and the git URL of the module, like this:\n\n<pre><code>pip install git+https://server/repo.git/mymodule/\npip install git+https://server/repo.git:mymodule/\n</code></pre>\n\nHowever, I received the following error:\n\n<pre><code>IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/tmp/pip-88tlLm-build/setup.py'\n</code></pre>\n\nIs there a way to install the module directly with pip without having to clone the repository first?"

        "content": "Unfortunately, pip does not have a built-in feature to directly install a Python module from a specific subdirectory within a git repository. However, there is a workaround you can use to achieve this by specifying the `subdirectory` option in the URL. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using the `#egg=<name>&subdirectory=<subdir>` syntax:**\n\n   You can instruct pip to look into a specific subdirectory by using the `#egg` and `subdirectory` options in the URL. Here's the command you can use:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install git+https://server/repo.git@<branch-or-tag>#egg=mymodule&subdirectory=mymodule\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<branch-or-tag>` with the branch name or tag you want to install from. If you want to use the default branch, you can omit the `@<branch-or-tag>` part.\n\n2. **Example:**\n\n   Assuming you want to install from the main branch, the command would look like this:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install git+https://server/repo.git#egg=mymodule&subdirectory=mymodule\n   ```\n\n   This command tells pip to clone the entire repository temporarily, but it will only install the package from the specified subdirectory, `mymodule`.\n\n3. **Note:**\n\n   Make sure that your `setup.py` file within the `mymodule` directory is correctly configured to define the module you want to install. This `setup.py` file is essential for pip to understand how to install your module.\n\nBy using this approach, you avoid the need to manually clone and delete the repository, allowing pip to handle it automatically."
