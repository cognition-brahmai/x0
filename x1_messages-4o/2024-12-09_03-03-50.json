Here are the contents of my files:\n\nIn my `shared/db.py` file I have:\n\n```python\nfrom flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\n\ndb = SQLAlchemy()\n```\n\nIn my `app.py` file:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\nfrom flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\nfrom shared.db import db\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'My connection string'\ndb.init_app(app)\n```\n\nAnd in my `user.py`:\n\n```python\nfrom shared.db import db\n\nclass User(db.Model):\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n    email_address = db.Column(db.String(300), unique=True, nullable=False)\n    password = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=False)\n```"

        "content": "The error message \"No application found. Either work inside a view function or push an application context\" is indicating that you're trying to perform database operations without an active application context. When you call `db.create_all()`, it requires the application context to be available so that it can access the application's configuration and other settings.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the application context is pushed before calling `db.create_all()`. You can do this by using the `app.app_context()` context manager. Here's how you can modify your setup to fix the problem:\n\nIn your `app.py` file, after initializing the app and the database, create a function or a block of code where you push the application context and call `db.create_all()`. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\nfrom shared.db import db\nfrom user import User  # Ensure you import your model so that SQLAlchemy recognizes it\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'Your connection string here'\ndb.init_app(app)\n\ndef create_database():\n    with app.app_context():\n        db.create_all()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    create_database()\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `create_database()` function pushes the application context using `with app.app_context():`. This ensures that `db.create_all()` runs within the context of the Flask application and has access to the necessary configuration.\n\nAdditionally, make sure that all your models are imported before calling `db.create_all()`, as shown by the import statement for the `User` model in the example above. This ensures that SQLAlchemy is aware of all the models that need to be created.\n\nBy structuring your code this way, you should be able to resolve the error and successfully create your database tables."
