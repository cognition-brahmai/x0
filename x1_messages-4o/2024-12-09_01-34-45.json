The problem I am trying to solve is embarrassingly parallel and I want to take advantage of that by using multiple threads. However, I am concerned about the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) being a barrier. Could you provide any guidelines or rules of thumb on which numpy operations can be expected to release the GIL for their duration? I am using 64-bit Python 2.7.1 on Linux, with numpy 1.5.1 and scipy 0.9.0rc2, built with Intel MKL 10.3.1."

        "content": "When working with Python, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can indeed be a concern for multi-threaded programs, especially in computationally intensive tasks. However, many numerical libraries like NumPy and SciPy are designed to release the GIL during their operations, allowing for parallel execution.\n\n1. **NumPy and GIL**: NumPy itself does not inherently release the GIL for its operations. However, when NumPy is linked against optimized libraries like Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKL) or OpenBLAS, these underlying libraries are typically designed to release the GIL during execution of their computational routines.\n\n2. **MKL and GIL**: Since you are using Intel MKL, you are in luck because MKL is designed to be thread-safe and releases the GIL during its operations. This means that linear algebra operations (such as those involving matrix multiplication, decompositions, eigenvalue problems, etc.) will likely release the GIL, allowing other threads to run concurrently.\n\n3. **Identifying GIL-Releasing Operations**: While there isn't a comprehensive list of which specific NumPy operations release the GIL, you can assume that many of the more computationally intensive functions, especially those that rely on BLAS/LAPACK operations (e.g., `dot`, `svd`, `inv`, `eig`, etc.), will release the GIL when linked against MKL or similar libraries.\n\n4. **Testing and Profiling**: The best way to determine if an operation releases the GIL is through testing and profiling. You can write a simple test where you run a NumPy operation in multiple threads and measure the performance to see if there is a speed-up. Tools such as `timeit` or profiling tools like `cProfile` can help you in this regard.\n\n5. **Alternative Strategies**: If you find that certain operations do not release the GIL, consider using the `multiprocessing` module for parallel execution, which spawns separate processes instead of threads. This bypasses the GIL entirely since each process has its own Python interpreter and memory space.\n\n6. **Updating Python and Libraries**: Although you are using Python 2.7.1 and somewhat older versions of NumPy and SciPy, consider updating to a more recent version of Python (Python 3.x) and updated libraries. Newer versions might have better support for multithreading and performance improvements.\n\nBy leveraging MKL and testing your specific workload, you should be able to take advantage of multi-threading effectively."
