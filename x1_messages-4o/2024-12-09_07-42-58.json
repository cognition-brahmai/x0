However, when I run the script, I get a UnicodeEncodeError stating that the 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\\xe9' in position 7 and that the ordinal is not in range(128). The string I am attempting to write is \"Identit\u00e9 secr\u00e8te (Abduction) [VF]\". Here is the relevant part of my code:\n\n```python\nprintinfo = title + \"\\t\" + old_vendor_id + \"\\t\" + apple_id + '\\n'\n# Write file\nf.write (printinfo + '\\n')\n```\n\nThe error I receive is:\n\n```python\nf.write(printinfo + '\\n')\nUnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\\xe9' in position 7: ordinal not in range(128)\n```\n\nHow can I resolve this error?"

        "content": "The `UnicodeEncodeError` you're encountering is due to Python attempting to encode a Unicode string using the ASCII codec, which cannot handle characters outside the ASCII range (0-127). The character `u'\\xe9'` corresponds to \"\u00e9\", which is not in the ASCII range.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you should explicitly specify an encoding that can handle such characters when opening the file. A common choice is UTF-8, which can encode any Unicode character.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to write the string to a file using UTF-8 encoding:\n\n```python\n# Open the file with UTF-8 encoding\nwith open('your_file_name.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n    printinfo = title + \"\\t\" + old_vendor_id + \"\\t\" + apple_id + '\\n'\n    # Write file\n    f.write(printinfo)\n```\n\nBy using the `with open(...)` construct, you also ensure that the file is properly closed after writing, even if an error occurs. This pattern is generally recommended for file operations in Python.\n\nMake sure you replace `'your_file_name.txt'` with the actual path to the file you want to write to. This should resolve the `UnicodeEncodeError` and allow you to write strings containing non-ASCII characters to your file."
