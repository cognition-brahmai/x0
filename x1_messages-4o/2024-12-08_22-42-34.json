        "content": "To enhance the existing Java code to filter out both weekends and holidays from the list of dates, you can maintain a list of holidays and use it in the filtering logic. Here's how you can modify the code:\n\n1. Create a list of holidays that you want to exclude.\n2. Modify the filter logic to exclude weekends and any date that falls on a holiday.\n\nHere's an example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```java\nimport java.time.DayOfWeek;\nimport java.time.LocalDate;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.stream.Collectors;\n\npublic class DateFilter {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        List<LocalDate> dates = new ArrayList<>();\n        // Populate dates list here, e.g., dates.add(LocalDate.of(2023, 12, 25)); for Christmas\n\n        // Define a list of holidays\n        List<LocalDate> holidays = List.of(\n            LocalDate.of(2023, 1, 1),  // New Year's Day\n            LocalDate.of(2023, 12, 25), // Christmas Day\n            // Add more holidays as needed\n        );\n\n        List<LocalDate> filteredDates = dates.stream()\n                .filter(date -> date.getDayOfWeek() != DayOfWeek.SATURDAY\n                        && date.getDayOfWeek() != DayOfWeek.SUNDAY\n                        && !holidays.contains(date))  // Exclude holidays\n                .collect(Collectors.toList());\n\n        // Output the filtered dates\n        filteredDates.forEach(System.out::println);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **List of Holidays**: You maintain a separate list of holidays (`holidays`) that you want to exclude from the filtered dates.\n- **Filter Logic**: The `.filter()` method now checks if the date is a weekend and if the date is present in the list of holidays. If the date is neither a weekend nor a holiday, it will be included in the `filteredDates` list.\n\n### Extensibility:\n- You can extend this code to load holidays from an external source, such as a database or a configuration file, if you have a large number of holidays or if they change frequently.\n- You might also consider using a library or API that provides holiday data specific to a country or region, which can simplify the management of holidays."
