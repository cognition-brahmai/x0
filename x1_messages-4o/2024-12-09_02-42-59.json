This code block, which was working perfectly fine in 2.7, is now throwing a TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str', specifically on the pattern search code. How can I resolve this issue?\nThe code:\n```\nwith open(fname, 'rb') as f:\n    lines = [x.strip() for x in f.readlines()]\n\nfor line in lines:\n    tmp = line.strip().lower()\n    if 'some-pattern' in tmp: continue\n    # ... code\n```\nI've also tried using the `.decode()` function on either side of the statement and also tried `if tmp.find('some-pattern') != -1: continue`, but none of them worked."

        "content": "In Python 3, there's a clear distinction between text (str) and binary data (bytes). When you open a file in binary mode (`'rb'`), the data you read is in bytes, not strings. To resolve the `TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'`, you need to decode the binary data into a string before performing string operations.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can modify your code to work with Python 3:\n\n```python\nwith open(fname, 'rb') as f:\n    lines = [x.strip() for x in f.readlines()]\n\nfor line in lines:\n    # Decode the line from bytes to str\n    tmp = line.decode('utf-8').strip().lower()\n    \n    # Check if the pattern exists in the string\n    if 'some-pattern' in tmp:\n        continue\n    # ... rest of your code\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Decoding**: Use the `.decode('utf-8')` method to convert the bytes to a string. This assumes your file is encoded in UTF-8. If it's encoded differently, replace `'utf-8'` with the appropriate encoding.\n\n2. **Binary vs Text Mode**: Since you are only reading text data, consider opening the file in text mode (`'r'`) instead of binary mode (`'rb'`). This way, Python will handle the decoding for you:\n\n    ```python\n    with open(fname, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n        lines = [x.strip() for x in f.readlines()]\n\n    for line in lines:\n        tmp = line.strip().lower()\n        if 'some-pattern' in tmp:\n            continue\n        # ... rest of your code\n    ```\n\n   This approach simplifies your code by eliminating the need for manual decoding, as the file is read as strings directly.\n\nBy using the above changes, your code should work as expected in Python 3."
