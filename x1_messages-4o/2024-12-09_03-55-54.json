For example, what does 5 in rank#5 represent? Also, for Part-Of-Speech (POS), what is the letter used to represent adverbs? I assume 'a' represents adjectives. I was unable to find an explanation either on their site or on other sites."

        "content": "SentiWordNet 3.0 is a lexical resource for opinion mining and sentiment analysis that assigns sentiment scores to synsets in WordNet. In SentiWordNet, each synset is associated with three numerical scores representing the degrees of positivity, negativity, and neutrality (or objectivity).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the elements you mentioned:\n\n1. **Rank**: The \"rank\" number, such as the `5` in `rank#5`, refers to the position of a synset in the ordered list of synsets for a particular word. Synsets are ranked based on their frequency of usage in the sense-tagged corpora that were used to create WordNet. A lower number indicates a more commonly used sense of the word.\n\n2. **Part-Of-Speech (POS) Tags**: In SentiWordNet, POS tags are used to indicate the grammatical category of the word. The common POS tags in SentiWordNet include:\n   - `n` for nouns\n   - `v` for verbs\n   - `a` for adjectives\n   - `r` for adverbs\n\nSo, in your assumption, `a` correctly represents adjectives, and `r` is used for adverbs.\n\nEach synset in SentiWordNet has three scores:\n- **PosScore**: Positive score indicating how positive the synset is.\n- **NegScore**: Negative score indicating how negative the synset is.\n- **ObjScore**: Objective score indicating how neutral or objective the synset is.\n\nThese scores are used to determine the overall sentiment of text by aggregating the scores of the words within the text."
