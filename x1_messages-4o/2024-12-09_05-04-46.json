I have defined a 'hello world' function in a file called 'functions.ipynb' and I want to import that function into another file. I have confirmed that both files are in the same directory. However, when I try to use \"import functions\", I encounter an ImportError stating \"No module named functions\". How can I resolve this?"

        "content": "Importing functions from one Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file into another can be a bit tricky since Jupyter Notebooks are not traditional Python modules. However, you can use a few different approaches to achieve this:\n\n### Method 1: Using `nbimporter`\n\n`nbimporter` is a module specifically designed to import code from Jupyter Notebooks. You can install it using pip, and then use it in your notebook to import functions from another notebook.\n\n1. **Install nbimporter**:\n   Open a terminal or a new Jupyter Notebook cell and run:\n   ```python\n   !pip install nbimporter\n   ```\n\n2. **Import your functions**:\n   In the Jupyter Notebook where you want to use the function, do the following:\n   ```python\n   import nbimporter\n   import functions\n\n   # Now you can use the functions defined in functions.ipynb\n   functions.your_function_name()\n   ```\n\n### Method 2: Using `exec` with `open`\n\nAnother way is to execute the code from the notebook directly. This is a more manual approach and may require some additional handling if your notebook has a lot of non-function code.\n\n1. **Open the .ipynb file**:\n   Read the content of the notebook as a JSON file and execute the code cells.\n\n2. **Execute the code cells**:\n   This can be done using `exec` in Python.\n\nHere's an example of how you might do it:\n\n```python\nimport io\nimport os\nimport nbformat\n\n# Load the notebook\nwith io.open('functions.ipynb', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n    nb = nbformat.read(f, as_version=4)\n\n# Execute each code cell\nfor cell in nb.cells:\n    if cell.cell_type == 'code':\n        exec(cell.source)\n```\n\n### Method 3: Convert Notebook to Python Script\n\nYou can convert the notebook into a Python script and then import it as a regular module.\n\n1. **Convert the Notebook**:\n   Use Jupyter's command-line tool to convert the notebook to a Python script:\n   ```bash\n   jupyter nbconvert --to script functions.ipynb\n   ```\n\n2. **Import the script**:\n   You can now import the Python script like a regular module:\n   ```python\n   import functions\n\n   # Use your function\n   functions.your_function_name()\n   ```\n\n### Method 4: Use IPython's `%run` magic\n\nYou can also use IPython's magic command `%run` to execute the entire notebook.\n\n```python\n%run functions.ipynb\n```\n\nThis will execute all the cells in `functions.ipynb`, and any functions defined there will be available in your current notebook's namespace.\n\n### Summary\n\nChoose the method that best suits your workflow. If you prefer a more modular approach and frequently need to import functions from other notebooks, `nbimporter` or converting the notebook to a Python script might be the best approach. If you need a quick solution for a one-time import, `%run` or using `exec` might suffice."
