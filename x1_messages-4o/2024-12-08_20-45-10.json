Colors can generally be classified into warm or cool categories based on the feelings or temperatures they evoke:\n\n1. **Orange**: Warm - Orange is typically considered a warm color as it is associated with warmth, energy, and enthusiasm.\n\n2. **Blue**: Cool - Blue is considered a cool color. It often evokes feelings of calmness, serenity, and is associated with water and the sky.\n\n3. **Gray**: Neutral - Gray is often seen as a neutral color, but it can lean towards cool, especially if it has blue undertones. However, it doesn't strongly fit into either the warm or cool category without context."
