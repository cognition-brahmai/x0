Currently, the toctree seems to display only in the 'master_doc' page and only in the main area instead of the sidebar. Is there a way to achieve this without using any third-party plugins, as I'll be using readthedocs to host the generated documentation?"

        "content": "To modify the sidebar in Sphinx to include the toctree for each of the HTML pages, you can adjust the configuration and templates in your Sphinx project. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Edit the `conf.py` file**: Ensure that your `conf.py` file is set up to use a theme that supports sidebars. Common themes like 'alabaster', 'sphinx_rtd_theme', or 'classic' generally support sidebars.\n\n2. **Modify the `html_sidebars` configuration**:\n   You can customize the `html_sidebars` option in your `conf.py` file to include the toctree in the sidebar for each page. Here's an example configuration:\n\n   ```python\n   html_sidebars = {\n       '**': [\n           'globaltoc.html',  # Generates the global table of contents\n           'relations.html',  # Links to previous and next chapters\n           'sourcelink.html', # Link to view the source\n           'searchbox.html',  # Search box\n       ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n   The `globaltoc.html` is the key here as it ensures the global table of contents (toctree) is included in the sidebar for all pages.\n\n3. **Ensure the theme supports sidebars**:\n   Make sure the theme you are using supports sidebars. If you are using the default theme, you might want to switch to `sphinx_rtd_theme`, which is widely used and supported by Read the Docs.\n\n   To install and use `sphinx_rtd_theme`, you can add it to your `conf.py`:\n\n   ```python\n   import sphinx_rtd_theme\n\n   extensions = [\n       # other extensions\n   ]\n\n   html_theme = 'sphinx_rtd_theme'\n   ```\n\n4. **Build your documentation**:\n   After making these changes, rebuild your documentation using the `make html` command. This will regenerate the HTML files with the updated sidebar configuration.\n\n5. **Check the result**:\n   After building, check the generated HTML files to ensure that the toctree appears in the sidebar as expected.\n\nThese steps should help you configure your Sphinx documentation to display the toctree in the sidebar for each page. This approach doesn't require any third-party plugins and should work seamlessly with Read the Docs."
