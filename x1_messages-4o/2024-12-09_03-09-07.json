        "content": "To extract noun phrases from a text using spaCy, you can make use of the `noun_chunks` attribute of a `Doc` object. This attribute provides an iterator for noun phrases in the document, which are also known as \"base noun phrases\" or \"NP-chunks.\" These are contiguous noun sequences that have a noun as their head.\n\nHere's a simple example to help you extract noun phrases using spaCy:\n\n1. First, make sure you have spaCy installed in your environment. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so with the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install spacy\n   ```\n\n2. Next, download a language model. For English, you can use the `en_core_web_sm` model:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm\n   ```\n\n3. Now, you can use the following code to extract noun phrases from a given text:\n\n   ```python\n   import spacy\n\n   # Load the spaCy model\n   nlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n   # Sample text\n   text = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\n\n   # Process the text\n   doc = nlp(text)\n\n   # Extract noun phrases\n   noun_phrases = list(doc.noun_chunks)\n\n   # Print noun phrases\n   for np in noun_phrases:\n       print(np.text)\n   ```\n\nIn this code, `doc.noun_chunks` provides an iterator over the noun phrases in the document. You can loop through these to get each noun phrase as a `Span` object, and then you can access the text of each noun phrase using `np.text`.\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nThe quick brown fox\nthe lazy dog\n```\n\nThese are the noun phrases extracted from the sample text. You can replace the sample text with any other text you want to analyze."
