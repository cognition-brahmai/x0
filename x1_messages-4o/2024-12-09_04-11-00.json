I have created a 'custom_logger' module which I plan to call from the main application only once, have it return a logger, which I'd then continue using. The submodules that I'd be importing into the app should only \"import logging as log\" and should just log messages with log.info/error('message') without adding anything site-specific to them. They should also use the already configured 'root' logger with all its formatting and handlers and not affect the root logger's configuration. I am facing issues with this implementation and need help to solve it."

        "content": "To implement a unified logging system across multiple Python scripts with minimal alterations, you can follow these steps to configure your logger in a centralized way. Here's a step-by-step approach to help you achieve this:\n\n### Step 1: Create the `custom_logger` Module\n\nCreate a module named `custom_logger.py` where you'll configure the logger. This module will define the format, handlers, and log level.\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\ndef setup_logger(name=None):\n    # Create a logger\n    logger = logging.getLogger(name)\n    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)  # You can set this to INFO or WARNING as needed\n\n    # Create a console handler\n    console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\n    console_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\n    # Create a formatter and set it for the handler\n    formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n    console_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\n    # Add the handler to the logger if it doesn't already have handlers\n    if not logger.hasHandlers():\n        logger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\n    return logger\n```\n\n### Step 2: Configure the Logger in the Main Application\n\nIn your main application script, use the `custom_logger` module to set up the logger.\n\n```python\nimport custom_logger\n\n# Setup the root logger\nlogger = custom_logger.setup_logger()\n\ndef main():\n    logger.info(\"Application has started\")\n    # Import and use submodules\n    # Example: import my_module\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Step 3: Use the Logger in Submodules\n\nIn the submodules, simply import the logging module and use it without further configuration.\n\n```python\nimport logging as log\n\ndef some_function():\n    log.info(\"This is an info message from some_function\")\n    log.error(\"This is an error message from some_function\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Central Configuration**: The `setup_logger` function in `custom_logger` sets up the logging configuration once. When `logging.getLogger(name)` is called with `name=None`, it returns the root logger. This means any submodule using `import logging as log` will use this configuration.\n  \n- **Avoid Multiple Handlers**: By checking `if not logger.hasHandlers()`, you ensure that multiple handlers aren't added to the logger if `setup_logger` is called multiple times.\n\n- **Submodules Logging**: Submodules merely import the `logging` module and start logging messages. They automatically use the configuration of the root logger that was set up in the main application.\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n1. **Multiple Handlers**: If you notice duplicate log messages, make sure that handlers are not being added multiple times by checking `logger.hasHandlers()`.\n\n2. **Log Level**: Ensure that the log level is appropriately set in `setup_logger`. If submodule logs aren't appearing, the log level might be too high.\n\nBy following this approach, you can have a centralized logging configuration with minimal changes to your existing submodules."
