When I print the row keys, they look like this: [u'\\ufeffa', u'b']. The BOM has been embedded into the key 'a' and it's throwing a KeyError: 'a'. What am I doing wrong? Here is my code for writing and reading the file:\n\nWriting the file:\n```python\nimport codecs\nimport csv\n\noutputFile = open(\"test.csv\", \"wb\")\noutputFile.write(codecs.BOM_UTF8)\nfieldnames = [\"a\", \"b\"]\nwriter = csv.DictWriter(outputFile, fieldnames, delimiter=\";\")\nwriter.writeheader()\nrow = dict([])\nfor i in range(10):\n    row[\"a\"] = str(i).encode(\"utf-8\")\n    row[\"b\"] = str(i*2).encode(\"utf-8\")\n    writer.writerow(row)\noutputFile.close()\n```\n\nReading the file:\n```python\nimport codecs\nimport csv\ninputFile = open(\"test.csv\", \"rb\")\nreader = csv.DictReader(inputFile, delimiter=\";\")\nfor row in reader:\n    print row[\"a\"]\ninputFile.close()\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the presence of the BOM (Byte Order Mark) in the first key of your CSV file. This BOM is being interpreted as part of the column header, which is why you're seeing the key as `u'\\ufeffa'` instead of `u'a'`. This leads to a `KeyError` when you try to access `row[\"a\"]`.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can modify the reading code to handle the BOM correctly. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Writing the file:\nYour writing code is fine, but ensure that you're consistently using UTF-8 encoding.\n\n### Reading the file:\nTo handle the BOM, you can use the `utf-8-sig` encoding while opening the file. This encoding is specifically designed to handle files with a BOM.\n```python\nimport codecs\nimport csv\n\n# Open the file with utf-8-sig encoding to handle BOM\nwith codecs.open(\"test.csv\", \"r\", encoding=\"utf-8-sig\") as inputFile:\n    reader = csv.DictReader(inputFile, delimiter=\";\")\n    for row in reader:\n        print(row[\"a\"])  # No need for `u` prefix in Python 3\n```\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- **Python 2 vs. Python 3**: If possible, consider upgrading to Python 3. Python 2 has been officially discontinued and Python 3 handles Unicode more gracefully.\n- **Context Managers**: Use `with` statements for file operations to ensure proper closing of files, even if an error occurs.\n- **UTF-8 Encoding**: While writing, ensure that if you are encoding strings, they are properly decoded before writing. However, in this case, since you are writing in binary mode (`\"wb\"`), it's fine.\n\nThis should resolve the `KeyError` by correctly handling the BOM during file reading."
