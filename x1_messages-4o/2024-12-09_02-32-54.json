Is 'sns' an acronym for something or is it an inside joke? I saw an issue on github which mentioned it might be related to the original name of the library, but I couldn't find more information about that."

        "content": "The convention to import Seaborn as `sns` rather than something like `sbn` isn't an acronym or an inside joke. It's primarily a result of historical convention and community adoption. The creator of Seaborn, Michael Waskom, chose `sns` as the import abbreviation early in the library's development. While there's no official explanation from him that details why this specific abbreviation was chosen, it likely came down to personal preference, simplicity, and ease of typing.\n\nAs with many libraries, once a convention is established and widely adopted by the community, it becomes the norm. This is similar to how `numpy` is often imported as `np` and `pandas` as `pd`. These conventions make code more readable and consistent across different projects and codebases, which is why they stick around even if they don't have a deeper meaning or rationale behind them."
