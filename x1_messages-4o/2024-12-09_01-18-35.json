First, start the Django shell by running:\n\n   ```\n   python manage.py shell\n   ```\n\n2. Once you're in the shell, you can access your settings by importing the `settings` module from `django.conf` and then using the `dir()` function or `vars()` function to list all settings.\n\n   Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n   ```python\n   from django.conf import settings\n\n   # To print all setting names\n   for setting in dir(settings):\n       print(setting)\n\n   # To print all settings with their values\n   for setting in dir(settings):\n       print(f\"{setting}: {getattr(settings, setting)}\")\n   ```\n\nThe `dir()` function lists all the attributes of the `settings` object, which includes all your Django settings. Using `getattr()` allows you to fetch the value of each setting dynamically. This will give you a comprehensive view of what settings are configured in your Django project."
