        "content": "To generate a set of 5 numbers that meet the specified criteria directly from a SQL database, you'll need to use SQL logic to filter and compute the necessary conditions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how you might achieve this:\n\n1. **Create a Table**: First, ensure you have a table with numbers. For simplicity, let's assume you have a table named `numbers` with a single column `num`.\n\n2. **SQL Query**: You'll need to write a SQL query that retrieves a combination of 5 numbers from this table and checks all your conditions.\n\nHere's the SQL code that could be used to find such a set of numbers:\n\n```sql\nSELECT n1.num AS num1, n2.num AS num2, n3.num AS num3, n4.num AS num4, n5.num AS num5\nFROM numbers n1\nJOIN numbers n2 ON n1.num < n2.num\nJOIN numbers n3 ON n2.num < n3.num\nJOIN numbers n4 ON n3.num < n4.num\nJOIN numbers n5 ON n4.num < n5.num\nWHERE n1.num + n2.num + n3.num + n4.num + n5.num = 100\n  AND n5.num * n1.num = n2.num - n4.num;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **JOINs**: We join the table with itself multiple times to select 5 distinct numbers.\n- **Conditions**:\n  - `n1.num < n2.num < n3.num < n4.num < n5.num`: Ensures that all numbers are distinct and ordered.\n  - `n1.num + n2.num + n3.num + n4.num + n5.num = 100`: Ensures the sum of the numbers is 100.\n  - `n5.num * n1.num = n2.num - n4.num`: Ensures the product of the largest and smallest numbers equals the difference between the second and fourth largest.\n\n### Considerations:\n\n- **Performance**: This query can be computationally expensive depending on the size of your `numbers` table, as it involves multiple self-joins and filtering conditions.\n- **Data Assumptions**: This query assumes the `numbers` table contains a sufficient range of numbers to meet the criteria. You may need to adjust or seed your table with suitable numbers.\n\nIf your dataset is large, consider using indexing or other optimization strategies to improve performance. If this query does not return results, ensure your table has a wide range of numbers to cover possible combinations."
