My initial approach was to write the following code:\n\n```C++\ntemplate<typename T>\n__global__ void kernel(T* ptr)\n{\n  extern __shared__ T smem[];\n  // calculations here ...                                                                                                                                          \n}\n\ntemplate<typename T>\nvoid call_kernel( T* ptr, const int n )\n{\n  dim3 dimBlock(n), dimGrid;\n  kernel<<<dimGrid, dimBlock, n*sizeof(T)>>>(ptr);\n}\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n  const int n = 32;\n  float *float_ptr;\n  double *double_ptr;\n  cudaMalloc( (void**)&float_ptr, n*sizeof(float) );\n  cudaMalloc( (void**)&double_ptr, n*sizeof(double) );\n\n  call_kernel( float_ptr, n );\n  call_kernel( double_ptr, n ); // problem, 2nd instantiation\n\n  cudaFree( (void*)float_ptr );\n  cudaFree( (void*)double_ptr );\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this code does not compile. The NVCC compiler gives the following error message:\n\n```C++\nmain.cu(4): error: declaration is incompatible with previous \"smem\"\n(4): here\n          detected during:\n            instantiation of \"void kernel(T *) [with T=double]\"\n(12): here\n            instantiation of \"void call_kernel(T *, int) [with T=double]\"\n(24): here\n```\n\nI understand that there is a naming conflict due to the shared memory being declared as extern. However, I believe there is no other way to define its size during runtime. Is there an elegant solution to this problem that avoids code duplication?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to the use of `extern __shared__` memory in a templated CUDA kernel. The error arises because the compiler is trying to instantiate two versions of the kernel, one for `float` and one for `double`, and it struggles with the shared memory declaration in the template context.\n\nThe solution is to ensure that the shared memory's linkage is properly managed so that the compiler doesn't see a conflict. One way to address this is to use a unique namespace or struct to encapsulate the shared memory. Here's how you can modify your code to handle this:\n\n```cpp\n#include <cstdio>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\ntemplate<typename T>\n__global__ void kernel(T* ptr)\n{\n  extern __shared__ __align__(sizeof(T)) unsigned char smem[];\n  T* shared_mem = reinterpret_cast<T*>(smem);\n  \n  // Example calculation: just set all shared memory elements to zero\n  int idx = threadIdx.x;\n  shared_mem[idx] = 0;\n  \n  // Make sure the data is written to shared memory\n  __syncthreads();\n  \n  // Use shared memory for some purpose\n  ptr[idx] = shared_mem[idx];\n}\n\ntemplate<typename T>\nvoid call_kernel(T* ptr, const int n)\n{\n  dim3 dimBlock(n);\n  dim3 dimGrid(1);\n  kernel<<<dimGrid, dimBlock, n * sizeof(T)>>>(ptr);\n}\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n  const int n = 32;\n  float *float_ptr;\n  double *double_ptr;\n  \n  cudaMalloc((void**)&float_ptr, n * sizeof(float));\n  cudaMalloc((void**)&double_ptr, n * sizeof(double));\n\n  call_kernel(float_ptr, n);\n  call_kernel(double_ptr, n);\n\n  cudaFree((void*)float_ptr);\n  cudaFree((void*)double_ptr);\n\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Shared Memory Declaration:** Use `unsigned char smem[]` with `__align__(sizeof(T))` to ensure proper alignment. Then, cast it to the appropriate type `T*` within the kernel. This prevents conflicts between different template instantiations.\n\n2. **Kernel Launch Configuration:** Ensure `dimGrid` is properly defined; here, I've set it to `dim3(1)` to ensure there's at least one block. Adjust as necessary based on your actual computation needs.\n\nThis approach should resolve the conflict, allowing you to use templated CUDA kernels with dynamically allocated shared memory without code duplication."
