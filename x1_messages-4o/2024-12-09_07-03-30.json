The base class, as well as the child classes, have methods named 'start' and 'stop'. I have stored all these objects in a single list. Now, I want to call the methods 'start' and 'stop' for each of these objects in the list. Is there a more elegant way to do this than writing separate functions to start and stop all objects as shown below?\n\n```python\nclass Base:\n    def start(self):\n        pass\n    def stop(self):\n        pass\n\nclass A(Base):\n    def start(self):\n        # do something for A\n        pass\n    def stop(self):\n        # do something for A\n        pass\n\nclass B(Base):\n    def start(self):\n        pass\n    def stop(self):\n        pass\n\na1 = A(); a2 = A()\nb1 = B(); b2 = B()\n\nall_obj = [a1, a2, b1, b2]\n\ndef start_all(all_obj):\n    for item in all_obj:\n        item.start()\n\ndef stop_all(all_obj):\n    for item in all_obj:\n        item.stop()\n```"

        "content": "Yes, you can make this process more elegant and concise by using a loop directly within your main logic instead of defining separate functions for starting and stopping. Here's a streamlined approach using a single loop and Python's `getattr` function, which dynamically calls methods:\n\n```python\nclass Base:\n    def start(self):\n        pass\n    def stop(self):\n        pass\n\nclass A(Base):\n    def start(self):\n        # do something for A\n        pass\n    def stop(self):\n        # do something for A\n        pass\n\nclass B(Base):\n    def start(self):\n        pass\n    def stop(self):\n        pass\n\na1 = A(); a2 = A()\nb1 = B(); b2 = B()\n\nall_obj = [a1, a2, b1, b2]\n\n# Method to call a specific method on all objects\ndef call_method_on_all(objects, method_name):\n    for obj in objects:\n        method = getattr(obj, method_name, None)\n        if callable(method):\n            method()\n\n# Start all objects\ncall_method_on_all(all_obj, 'start')\n\n# Stop all objects\ncall_method_on_all(all_obj, 'stop')\n```\n\nIn this approach, `call_method_on_all` is a generic function that takes a list of objects and a method name as arguments. It uses `getattr` to check if the method exists and is callable, then calls it. This way, you can easily start and stop all objects without defining separate functions for each action, making your code cleaner and more maintainable."
