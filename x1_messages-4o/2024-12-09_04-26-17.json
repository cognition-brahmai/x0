I am trying to iterate over a dictionary and print out all key-value pairs where the value is not a nested dictionary. However, if the value is a dictionary, I want to go deeper into it and print out its key-value pairs and so on. Here's the code I have so far:\n\n```python\nfor k, v in d.iteritems():\n    if type(v) is dict:\n        for t, c in v.iteritems():\n            print \"{0} : {1}\".format(t, c)\n```\n\nI also tried this recursive function, but it only seems to print one thing:\n\n```python\ndef printDict(d):\n    for k, v in d.iteritems():\n        if type(v) is dict:\n            printDict(v)\n        else:\n            print \"{0} : {1}\".format(k, v)\n```\n\nI'm testing this with the following dictionary:\n\n```python\n{u'xml': {u'config': {u'portstatus': {u'status': u'good'}, u'target': u'1'},u'port': u'11'}}\n```\n\nThe result I'm getting is:\n\n```python\nxml : {u'config': {u'portstatus': {u'status': u'good'}, u'target': u'1'}, u'port': u'11'}\n```\n\nCan anyone help me solve this problem?"

        "content": "To loop through all nested dictionary values in Python and print out all key-value pairs where the value is not a dictionary, you can use a recursive approach to traverse the dictionary structure. The issue you are encountering is likely due to using Python 2's `iteritems()` method, which you are calling on the top-level dictionary only, and not on nested dictionaries.\n\nHere's how you can modify your recursive function to properly traverse and print all key-value pairs:\n\n```python\ndef print_dict(d):\n    for k, v in d.items():  # Use .items() for Python 3, .iteritems() for Python 2\n        if isinstance(v, dict):\n            print_dict(v)  # Recursively call the function for nested dictionaries\n        else:\n            print(f\"{k} : {v}\")  # Use formatted string for Python 3\n\n# Example usage:\nnested_dict = {u'xml': {u'config': {u'portstatus': {u'status': u'good'}, u'target': u'1'}, u'port': u'11'}}\nprint_dict(nested_dict)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Recursive Function**: The function `print_dict` is defined to take a dictionary `d` as its argument. It iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary.\n\n2. **Check for Nested Dictionary**: The function checks if a value is a dictionary using `isinstance(v, dict)`. If it is, the function calls itself recursively with this nested dictionary, allowing it to go deeper into the dictionary structure.\n\n3. **Printing Key-Value Pairs**: If the value is not a dictionary, it prints the key-value pair. In this example, I've used f-strings (formatted string literals) for Python 3. If you're using Python 2, you can continue using the `print \"{0} : {1}\".format(k, v)` syntax.\n\n4. **Compatibility with Python Versions**: This example uses `d.items()` for iterating over dictionary items, which is compatible with Python 3. If you are using Python 2, you should replace `d.items()` with `d.iteritems()`.\n\nThis should print all key-value pairs in the nested dictionary structure, allowing you to see all values regardless of how deeply they are nested."
