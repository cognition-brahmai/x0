I want to use Flask for this instead of our higher-level nginx instance in order to reuse our existing authentication system built into our app. I'm trying to keep this as \"single sign-on\" as possible. I am finding it difficult to bridge the Flask app through to something like httplib or urllib. Is there an existing module or other code that can facilitate this?"

        "content": "To proxy requests from your Flask app to another web service while leveraging your existing authentication system, you can use the `requests` library combined with Flask's routing capabilities. There isn't a built-in Flask module specifically for proxying, but you can manually forward requests and handle responses using the `requests` library. Here's a basic example to help you get started:\n\n1. **Install the requests library** if you haven't already:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a route in your Flask app** to handle the proxying:\n\n   ```python\n   from flask import Flask, request, Response\n   import requests\n\n   app = Flask(__name__)\n\n   # Configure the target service URL\n   TARGET_SERVICE_URL = 'http://localhost:5001'  # Replace with your service URL\n\n   # Proxy route\n   @app.route('/proxy/<path:path>', methods=['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'])\n   def proxy(path):\n       # Construct the full target URL\n       url = f\"{TARGET_SERVICE_URL}/{path}\"\n\n       # Forward the request method, headers, and data to the target service\n       response = requests.request(\n           method=request.method,\n           url=url,\n           headers={key: value for key, value in request.headers if key != 'Host'},\n           data=request.get_data(),\n           cookies=request.cookies,\n           allow_redirects=False\n       )\n\n       # Create a Response object with the data from the target service\n       proxy_response = Response(\n           response.content,\n           response.status_code,\n           response.headers.items()\n       )\n\n       return proxy_response\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       app.run(port=5000)\n   ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- This code sets up a Flask app that proxies requests to another service running on the same machine.\n- The `TARGET_SERVICE_URL` variable holds the URL of the service you want to proxy to.\n- The `proxy` function captures requests made to the `/proxy/<path:path>` endpoint, forwards them to the target service while preserving the HTTP method, headers, and body, and then returns the response from the target service back to the client.\n- You can adjust the `/proxy/<path:path>` route to match the endpoint you want to expose.\n\nThis approach allows you to keep using your existing authentication system, as the proxy is part of your Flask app. You can also add any additional logic required to handle authentication or modify requests/responses as needed."
