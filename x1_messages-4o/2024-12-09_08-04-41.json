To work around this issue, I am using the deprecated double-underscore method `some_var.__len__()`. While this method works for now, I am concerned that future string implementations might render this workaround ineffective. Is there an improved way to find the length of a string in Jinja or Flask?"

This approach is not only more readable but also less likely to break with future updates. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```html\n{{ some_var|length }}\n```\n\nThis will return the length of `some_var`. The `length` filter can be used not only with strings but also with lists and other collections to get their length.\n\nIf you are using Flask with Jinja templates, this method is fully supported and is the recommended way to handle such situations. This approach should ensure compatibility with future updates to Jinja or Flask."
