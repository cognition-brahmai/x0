When I use itertools.product, I am not getting the result I want. Here is what I have tried:\n\n```python\narrays = [(-1,+1), (-2,+2), (-3,+3)]\ncp = list(itertools.product(arrays))\n```\n\nThe result I get is `[((-1, 1),), ((-2, 2),), ((-3, 3),)]`, but what I want is `[(-1,-2,-3), (-1,-2,+3), (-1,+2,-3), (-1,+2,+3), ..., (+1,+2,-3), (+1,+2,+3)]`. I have also tried using itertools.islice and iter methods like this:\n\n```python\ncp = list(itertools.product(itertools.islice(arrays, len(arrays))))\ncp = list(itertools.product(iter(arrays, len(arrays))))\n```\n\nBut they all gave me the same result. Any ideas on how to solve this?"

        "content": "To get the Cartesian product of the elements within the arrays in your list, you need to unpack the list when passing it to `itertools.product`. The mistake in your code is that you're passing the list `arrays` as a single argument, which causes `itertools.product` to treat it as a single iterable. Instead, you should use the unpacking operator `*` to pass each sublist in `arrays` as separate arguments to `itertools.product`.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\narrays = [(-1, +1), (-2, +2), (-3, +3)]\ncp = list(itertools.product(*arrays))\n\nprint(cp)\n```\n\nThis will give you the desired Cartesian product:\n\n```\n[(-1, -2, -3), (-1, -2, 3), (-1, 2, -3), (-1, 2, 3), (1, -2, -3), (1, -2, 3), (1, 2, -3), (1, 2, 3)]\n```\n\nBy using the unpacking operator `*`, you effectively pass each tuple within the `arrays` list as separate arguments to `itertools.product`, which is what you need to achieve the Cartesian product across the elements of the tuples."
