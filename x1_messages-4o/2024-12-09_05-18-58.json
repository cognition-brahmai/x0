Here is an example fake function that I have been trying to use:\n\n```python\ndef my_print(begin, text, end):\n    \"\"\"Print 'text' in UPPER between 'begin' and 'end' in lower\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in (begin, text, end):\n        assert isinstance(i, str), \"Input variables should be strings\"\n    out = begin.lower() + text.upper() + end.lower()\n    print out\n\ndef test():\n    \"\"\"Put your test cases here!\n    \"\"\"\n    assert my_print(\"asdf\", \"fssfpoie\", \"fsodf\")\n    assert not my_print(\"fasdf\", 33, \"adfas\")\n    print \"All tests passed\"\n\ntest()\n```\nIs using assert the right approach? Should I use try/except instead? Also, my assert set of tests does not seem to work properly."

        "content": "Using `assert` to check the types of variables in a function can be useful for debugging purposes, but it is not the most robust way to ensure type safety in production code. Assertions can be disabled in Python when running the interpreter in optimized mode (using the `-O` flag), so they should not be relied upon for enforcing critical checks.\n\nFor more reliable type checking, consider using the following approaches:\n\n1. **Type Hints**: Python supports type hints, which allow you to specify the expected types of function arguments and return values. Although type hints do not enforce type checking at runtime, they provide valuable information for static type checkers like `mypy` and for developers reading your code.\n\n2. **Explicit Type Checking**: Use explicit type checks with `if` statements to raise exceptions if types are incorrect. This is more reliable for enforcing type checks at runtime.\n\n3. **Unit Testing**: Use a testing framework like `unittest` or `pytest` to write comprehensive test cases.\n\nHere is an updated version of your code using type hints and explicit type checking:\n\n```python\ndef my_print(begin: str, text: str, end: str) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Print 'text' in UPPER between 'begin' and 'end' in lower.\"\"\"\n    if not all(isinstance(i, str) for i in (begin, text, end)):\n        raise TypeError(\"All input variables should be strings\")\n    \n    out = begin.lower() + text.upper() + end.lower()\n    print(out)\n\ndef test():\n    \"\"\"Run test cases.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        my_print(\"asdf\", \"fssfpoie\", \"fsodf\")  # Should work\n        print(\"Test 1 passed\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Test 1 failed: {e}\")\n\n    try:\n        my_print(\"fasdf\", 33, \"adfas\")  # Should raise TypeError\n        print(\"Test 2 failed\")\n    except TypeError:\n        print(\"Test 2 passed\")\n\ntest()\n```\n\nIn this version:\n\n- The function `my_print` uses type hints to indicate that all parameters should be strings.\n- The function checks types explicitly and raises a `TypeError` if any parameter is not a string.\n- The `test` function uses `try/except` blocks to verify that the correct exceptions are raised and prints the results. This is more reliable than using assertions for this purpose."
