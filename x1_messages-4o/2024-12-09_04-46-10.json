I have attempted multiple solutions such as manually setting the device with `torch.cuda.set_device(device)` at the beginning of every script, using different GPUs, and downgrading pytorch and cuda versions. However, none of these approaches have been successful. The error message I receive is as follows:\n\n```python\nRuntimeError: NCCL error in: /opt/conda/conda-bld/pytorch_1614378083779/work/torch/lib/c10d/ProcessGroupNCCL.cpp:825, unhandled cuda error, NCCL version 2.7.8\nncclUnhandledCudaError: Call to CUDA function failed.\n```\n\nI also get a 'ncclSystemError: System call (socket, malloc, munmap, etc) failed.' error. The versions of nvcc and pytorch.cuda do not match:\n\n```python\n(meta_learning_a100) [miranda9@hal-dgx ~]$ python -c \"import torch;print(torch.version.cuda)\"\n11.1\n(meta_learning_a100) [miranda9@hal-dgx ~]$ nvcc -V\nnvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver\nCopyright (c) 2005-2020 NVIDIA Corporation\nBuilt on Wed_Jul_22_19:09:09_PDT_2020\nCuda compilation tools, release 11.0, V11.0.221\nBuild cuda_11.0_bu.TC445_37.28845127_0\n```\n\nHow can I solve these issues?"

        "content": "The error you are encountering seems to be related to a mismatch between your CUDA toolkit version and the CUDA version that PyTorch is built against, as well as potential system-level issues with NCCL (NVIDIA Collective Communications Library). Here are a few steps you can take to try to resolve these errors:\n\n1. **Ensure Compatibility:**\n   - Check the compatibility of the PyTorch version you are using with your CUDA toolkit version. You can refer to the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/) to find the versions of PyTorch that are compatible with different CUDA versions.\n   - Ideally, your `nvcc` version should match the CUDA version used by PyTorch. Since your `nvcc` is 11.0 and PyTorch is built with 11.1, you may need to consider aligning these versions.\n\n2. **Update or Downgrade CUDA Toolkit:**\n   - If possible, upgrade or downgrade your CUDA toolkit to match the version that PyTorch requires. If PyTorch is built with CUDA 11.1, you can update your CUDA toolkit to 11.1 to avoid version mismatch issues.\n\n3. **Reinstall PyTorch:**\n   - Once you have aligned your CUDA version, reinstall PyTorch ensuring that you specify the appropriate CUDA version. You can do this with a command like:\n     ```bash\n     pip install torch==<desired_version> torchvision==<desired_version> torchaudio==<desired_version> -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html\n     ```\n   - Make sure to replace `<desired_version>` with the specific versions you need.\n\n4. **NCCL System Errors:**\n   - Ensure that your system has sufficient memory and resources available. The `ncclSystemError` can sometimes be related to resource limitations.\n   - Check your NCCL installation and ensure it is compatible with your current system and CUDA setup.\n\n5. **Environment Variables:**\n   - Set some NCCL environment variables to help with debugging and potentially resolve issues:\n     ```bash\n     export NCCL_DEBUG=INFO\n     export NCCL_DEBUG_SUBSYS=ALL\n     export NCCL_IB_DISABLE=1\n     ```\n   - These can provide more detailed logs which might help identify the root cause.\n\n6. **Use a Different Backend:**\n   - As a temporary workaround, consider using a different backend for distributed operations, such as Gloo, if NCCL continues to cause issues:\n     ```python\n     torch.distributed.init_process_group(backend='gloo', ...)\n     ```\n\n7. **Check for System-Specific Issues:**\n   - Ensure that your NVIDIA drivers are up to date.\n   - Check for any known issues with your specific hardware, such as specific GPU models.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the root cause of the errors you're encountering."
