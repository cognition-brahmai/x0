        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this by writing a JavaScript function that processes the input string to count the characters and words. Here's a sample function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction analyzeString(input) {\n  // Trim the input to remove leading and trailing whitespace\n  const trimmedInput = input.trim();\n  \n  // Count characters excluding spaces\n  const characterCount = trimmedInput.replace(/\\s+/g, '').length;\n\n  // Split the string into words and count them\n  const wordsArray = trimmedInput.split(/\\s+/);\n  const wordCount = wordsArray.filter(word => word !== '').length;\n\n  // Create an object with the results\n  const result = {\n    characterCount: characterCount,\n    wordCount: wordCount\n  };\n\n  return result;\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst inputString = \"Hello, world! This is a test sentence.\";\nconst analysis = analyzeString(inputString);\nconsole.log(analysis); // { characterCount: 31, wordCount: 7 }\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `analyzeString` takes a string as input.\n- It trims any leading or trailing spaces to ensure accurate word and character counts.\n- It calculates `characterCount` by removing all spaces and counting the remaining characters.\n- It calculates `wordCount` by splitting the string into an array of words using whitespace as a delimiter, and then filters out any empty strings.\n- Finally, it returns an object containing both the `characterCount` and `wordCount`.\n\nYou can test this function with different strings to see how it works!"
