Here's a simple way to mix those ingredients to create a basic batter, which can be used for pancakes, waffles, or even a simple cake:\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 1 cup flour\n- 2 eggs\n- 1 cup milk\n- 2 tablespoons sugar\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Prepare the Ingredients:**\n   - Measure out all the ingredients to ensure you have the correct amounts.\n\n2. **Mix the Dry Ingredients:**\n   - In a large mixing bowl, add the flour and sugar. Use a whisk or spoon to combine them thoroughly.\n\n3. **Add the Wet Ingredients:**\n   - Crack the eggs into the bowl with the dry ingredients. \n   - Pour in the milk.\n\n4. **Combine Everything:**\n   - Using a whisk or an electric mixer, blend the ingredients together until you have a smooth, lump-free batter. Make sure everything is well combined.\n\n5. **Rest the Batter (Optional):**\n   - Let the batter sit for about 5-10 minutes. This allows the flour to absorb the liquids, resulting in a smoother texture.\n\n6. **Ready to Use:**\n   - Your batter is now ready to be used for your desired recipe. If you\u2019re making pancakes or waffles, cook them on a preheated griddle or waffle iron. For a cake, pour the batter into a greased cake pan and bake as required.\n\nFeel free to adjust the quantities or add other ingredients like vanilla extract, a pinch of salt, or baking powder depending on your specific recipe needs. Enjoy your cooking!"
