I would like to know how to force Scrapy to crawl duplicate URLs or URLs which have already been crawled. I tried finding solutions online but found no relevant help. I stumbled upon \"DUPEFILTER_CLASS = RFPDupeFilter\" and \"SgmlLinkExtractor\" from a stack overflow post but this is the opposite of what I am looking for."

        "content": "In Scrapy, the default behavior is to avoid crawling duplicate URLs using a dupe filter. However, you can modify this behavior if you want Scrapy to crawl URLs more than once. Here are a few strategies you can use:\n\n1. **Custom Dupe Filter**:\n   You can create a custom duplicate filter by subclassing `RFPDupeFilter` and overriding the `request_seen` method to always return `False`. This will force Scrapy to treat every request as unique.\n\n   ```python\n   from scrapy.dupefilters import RFPDupeFilter\n\n   class CustomDupeFilter(RFPDupeFilter):\n       def request_seen(self, request):\n           return False\n   ```\n\n   Then, in your `settings.py`, set the `DUPEFILTER_CLASS` to your custom filter:\n\n   ```python\n   DUPEFILTER_CLASS = 'myproject.dupefilters.CustomDupeFilter'\n   ```\n\n2. **Unique URL Parameters**:\n   If you don't want to change the dupe filter, another approach is to make each URL unique by adding a random query parameter. This way, Scrapy will perceive each URL as unique:\n\n   ```python\n   import scrapy\n   import random\n\n   class MySpider(scrapy.Spider):\n       name = 'my_spider'\n       \n       def start_requests(self):\n           urls = [\n               'http://example.com/page1',\n               'http://example.com/page2',\n           ]\n           for url in urls:\n               modified_url = f\"{url}?rand={random.randint(0, 10000)}\"\n               yield scrapy.Request(url=modified_url, callback=self.parse)\n\n       def parse(self, response):\n           # Your parsing logic here\n   ```\n\n3. **Disable Caching**:\n   If you're using the HTTP cache middleware, make sure to disable it since it might also be serving cached responses:\n\n   ```python\n   HTTPCACHE_ENABLED = False\n   ```\n\nBy using one of these methods, you should be able to make Scrapy crawl URLs, even if they have been crawled before. Keep in mind that this approach can lead to increased server load and potentially get your scraper blocked by the target website, so use it judiciously."
