When I execute the command 'python setup.py build_ext --inplace' in the Cython directory, I encounter a gcc error stating that the '-mno-cygwin' option is unrecognized.

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the `-mno-cygwin` flag, which was deprecated and removed in later versions of GCC, starting with version 4.7. This flag was used to build native Windows applications using the Cygwin environment, but since you're using a 64-bit MinGW setup, this flag is unnecessary and unsupported.\n\nHere's how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Remove `-mno-cygwin` Flag:**\n   You need to modify the configuration so that it doesn't use the `-mno-cygwin` flag. This can be done by editing your `distutils.cfg` file or directly in the `setup.py` file if it's hardcoded there.\n\n2. **Edit `distutils.cfg`:**\n   - Locate your `distutils.cfg` file, typically found in `C:\\Python26\\Lib\\distutils`.\n   - Open the file in a text editor and look for any lines specifying `-mno-cygwin` and remove them.\n\n   Example of what your `distutils.cfg` might look like:\n   \n   ```ini\n   [build]\n   compiler=mingw32\n\n   [build_ext]\n   compiler=mingw32\n   ```\n\n   Ensure there's no mention of `-mno-cygwin`.\n\n3. **Check `setup.py`:**\n   - Open your `setup.py` file and search for any instances where `-mno-cygwin` might be added to the `extra_compile_args` or similar parameters. If found, remove it.\n\n4. **Ensure Proper GCC Version:**\n   - Make sure that your MinGW installation is properly configured and that you're using a version compatible with Windows 64-bit. You might want to consider using a more recent version of MinGW.\n\n5. **Alternative MinGW Distribution:**\n   - Consider using `mingw-w64`, which is specifically designed for 64-bit Windows and may offer better compatibility.\n\n6. **Verify Python and Cython Compatibility:**\n   - Ensure that the versions of Python, Cython, and your compiler are compatible. Python 2.6 is quite old, and upgrading to at least Python 2.7 or even Python 3.x might solve some compatibility issues.\n\nAfter making these changes, try running your build command again:\n\n```bash\npython setup.py build_ext --inplace\n```\n\nBy removing the `-mno-cygwin` flag, the GCC should compile your extension without recognizing errors regarding unsupported options."
