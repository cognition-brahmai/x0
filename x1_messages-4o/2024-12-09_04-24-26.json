Each step is submitted as a process with import/export queues. I use queues and child processes terminate themselves when they read \"None\" from the queue. However, if a child process encounters an unhandled exception, the parent does not recognize it and the rest of the processes continue to run. I would like the whole process to stop and at best re-raise the child error. How do I detect the child error in the parent and how do I kill my child processes after detecting the error?\n\nCode:\n```python\n# Establish communication queues\nmongo_input_result_q = multiprocessing.Queue()\nmapper_result_q = multiprocessing.Queue()\nconverter_result_q = multiprocessing.Queue()\n\n# create child processes\n# all processes generated here are subclasses of \"multiprocessing.Process\"\n\n# create mapper\nmappers = [mongo_relational_mapper.MongoRelationalMapper(mongo_input_result_q, mapper_result_q, columns, 1000)\n           for i in range(10)]\n\n# create datatype converter, converts everything to str\nconverters = [datatype_converter.DatatypeConverter(mapper_result_q, converter_result_q, 'str', 1000)\n              for i in range(10)]\n\n# create mysql writer\n# I create a list of writers. currently only one, \n# but I have the option to parallellize it further\nwriters = [mysql_inserter.MySqlWriter(mysql_host, mysql_user, mysql_passwd, mysql_schema, converter_result_q\n           , columns, 'w_'+mysql_table, 1000) for i in range(1)]\n\n# starting mapper\nfor mapper in mappers:\n    mapper.start()\ntime.sleep(1)\n\n# starting converter\nfor converter in converters:\n    converter.start()\n\n# starting writer\nfor writer in writers:\n    writer.start()\n\n# put each dataset read to queue for the mapper\nfor row in mongo_collection.find({inc_column: {\"$gte\": start}}):\n    mongo_input_result_q.put(row)\n    count += 1\n    if count % log_counter == 0:\n        print 'Mongo Reader' + \" \" + str(count)\nprint \"MongoReader done\"\n\n# Processes are terminated when they read \"None\" object from queue\n# now that reading is finished, put None for each mapper in the queue so they terminate themselves\n# the same for all followup processes\nfor mapper in mappers:\n    mongo_input_result_q.put(None)\nfor mapper in mappers:\n    mapper.join()\nfor converter in converters:\n    mapper_result_q.put(None)\nfor converter in converters:\n    converter.join()\nfor writer in writers:\n    converter_result_q.put(None)\nfor writer in writers:\n    writer.join()\n```"

        "content": "To handle exceptions in child processes and ensure that the parent process can detect these exceptions and terminate all processes if any child fails, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Use a Multiprocessing Manager for Shared State**: You can use a `multiprocessing.Manager` to create a shared dictionary or list that child processes can use to report exceptions back to the parent process.\n\n2. **Modify the Child Process to Catch Exceptions**: In each child process, catch any exceptions and store the exception details in the shared object.\n\n3. **Monitor the Shared Object in the Parent Process**: The parent process should periodically check the shared object to see if any child process has reported an exception.\n\n4. **Terminate All Processes if an Exception is Detected**: If an exception is detected in any child process, terminate all child processes and optionally re-raise the exception in the parent process.\n\nHere is how you can implement these steps in your code:\n\n### Step 1: Use a Multiprocessing Manager\nSet up a multiprocessing manager and a shared dictionary to store exceptions:\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\nimport traceback\n\nmanager = multiprocessing.Manager()\nexception_dict = manager.dict()\n```\n\n### Step 2: Modify Child Processes\nModify your child process classes (e.g., `MongoRelationalMapper`, `DatatypeConverter`, `MySqlWriter`) to catch exceptions and report them:\n\n```python\nclass MongoRelationalMapper(multiprocessing.Process):\n    def __init__(self, input_queue, output_queue, columns, batch_size, exception_dict):\n        super(MongoRelationalMapper, self).__init__()\n        self.input_queue = input_queue\n        self.output_queue = output_queue\n        self.columns = columns\n        self.batch_size = batch_size\n        self.exception_dict = exception_dict\n\n    def run(self):\n        try:\n            # Your existing processing logic here\n            pass\n        except Exception as e:\n            self.exception_dict[self.name] = traceback.format_exc()\n```\n\nRepeat this for other child process classes (`DatatypeConverter`, `MySqlWriter`).\n\n### Step 3: Monitor in Parent Process\nPeriodically check the shared dictionary for any reported exceptions:\n\n```python\ndef check_exceptions(exception_dict):\n    if exception_dict:\n        for proc_name, tb in exception_dict.items():\n            print(f\"Exception in {proc_name}: {tb}\")\n        return True\n    return False\n\n# Start a loop to monitor exceptions\nwhile True:\n    if check_exceptions(exception_dict):\n        # Terminate all child processes\n        for mapper in mappers:\n            mapper.terminate()\n        for converter in converters:\n            converter.terminate()\n        for writer in writers:\n            writer.terminate()\n        break\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n```\n\n### Step 4: Clean Up and Re-Raise\nAfter terminating the processes, you can clean up and optionally raise a custom exception in the parent process to handle the failure:\n\n```python\nif check_exceptions(exception_dict):\n    raise RuntimeError(\"A child process encountered an unhandled exception.\")\n```\n\nBy implementing these steps, you can ensure that any unhandled exception in a child process is detected by the parent process, which can then terminate all child processes and handle the error appropriately."
