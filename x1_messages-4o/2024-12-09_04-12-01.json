I have defined a custom loss function as follows:\n\n```python\ndef weighted_cross_entropy(weights):\n    weights = K.variable(weights)\n    def loss(y_true, y_pred):\n        y_pred = K.clip(y_pred, K.epsilon(), 1-K.epsilon())\n        loss = y_true * K.log(y_pred) * weights\n        loss = -K.sum(loss, -1)\n        return loss\n    return loss\n\nweighted_loss = weighted_cross_entropy([0.1,0.9])\n```\n\nDuring the training, this `weighted_loss` function worked perfectly fine as a loss function. After training, I saved the model as `.h5` file using the standard `model.save` function from Keras API. But, when I am trying to load this model using the `load_model` function in the following manner:\n\n```python\nmodel = load_model(path,custom_objects={\"weighted_loss\":weighted_loss})\n```\n\nI am encountering a `ValueError` stating that the loss is unknown. The error message is as follows:\n\n```\nFile \"...\\predict.py\", line 29, in my_script\n\"weighted_loss\": weighted_loss})\nFile \"...\\Continuum\\anaconda3\\envs\\processing\\lib\\site-packages\\keras\\engine\\saving.py\", line 419, in load_model\nmodel = _deserialize_model(f, custom_objects, compile)\nFile \"...\\Continuum\\anaconda3\\envs\\processing\\lib\\site-packages\\keras\\engine\\saving.py\", line 312, in _deserialize_model\nsample_weight_mode=sample_weight_mode)\nFile \"...\\Continuum\\anaconda3\\envs\\processing\\lib\\site-packages\\keras\\engine\\training.py\", line 139, in compile\nloss_function = losses.get(loss)\nFile \"...\\Continuum\\anaconda3\\envs\\processing\\lib\\site-packages\\keras\\losses.py\", line 133, in get\nreturn deserialize(identifier)\nFile \"...\\Continuum\\anaconda3\\envs\\processing\\lib\\site-packages\\keras\\losses.py\", line 114, in deserialize\nprintable_module_name='loss function')\nFile \"...\\Continuum\\anaconda3\\envs\\processing\\lib\\site-packages\\keras\\utils\\generic_utils.py\", line 165, in deserialize_keras_object\n':' + function_name)\nValueError: Unknown loss function:loss\n```\n\nCould the issue be due to how I have wrapped my loss definition and how can I fix it?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to how custom loss functions are handled when loading a saved Keras model. When you define a custom loss function, you need to ensure that it's properly recognized by Keras during the loading process.\n\nHere are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Proper Naming**: The error message suggests that Keras cannot recognize the custom loss function. Double-check that the name you provided in `custom_objects` matches the name used in your model.\n\n2. **Save the Entire Model**: When you save a model with a custom loss function, ensure that the complete model, including the architecture, optimizer, and any custom functions, is saved. This is typically done using `model.save('model.h5')`.\n\n3. **Correct Custom Objects**: When loading the model, you need to make sure that the `custom_objects` dictionary correctly maps the function name to the function object. In your case, you might need to pass the function that creates the loss, not just the created loss function. Here's how you can adjust your code:\n\n   ```python\n   def weighted_cross_entropy(weights):\n       weights = K.variable(weights)\n       def loss(y_true, y_pred):\n           y_pred = K.clip(y_pred, K.epsilon(), 1-K.epsilon())\n           loss = y_true * K.log(y_pred) * weights\n           loss = -K.sum(loss, -1)\n           return loss\n       return loss\n\n   # Define the custom loss using the function\n   weighted_loss_function = weighted_cross_entropy([0.1, 0.9])\n\n   # Later, when loading the model\n   model = load_model('model.h5', custom_objects={'weighted_cross_entropy': weighted_cross_entropy})\n   ```\n\n4. **Lambda Layers**: If you're using any Lambda layers or custom layers that rely on custom operations within your model, ensure they are also included in the `custom_objects` dictionary.\n\n5. **Recompile Model**: After loading the model, you can also try recompiling it with the same loss function to ensure everything is set up correctly.\n\n   ```python\n   model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=weighted_loss_function)\n   ```\n\nThis should help Keras recognize your custom loss function when the model is being loaded. If the issue persists, consider checking Keras and TensorFlow documentation for any version-specific issues or updates."
