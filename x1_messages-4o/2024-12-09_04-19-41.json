The same string can appear once or more in the input list and it must appear the same number of times in the output. I am currently using a \"brute force\" method involving loops, but I am looking for a more efficient one-liner solution in Python."

        "content": "To efficiently randomize a list of strings in Python, you can use the `random.shuffle` method from Python's `random` module. This method shuffles the list in place and is very efficient. Here's how you can do it in a one-liner:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef randomize_list(strings):\n    random.shuffle(strings)\n    return strings\n```\n\nYou can call this function with your list of strings as the argument, and it will return the list in a randomized order. Note that `random.shuffle` modifies the original list in place, so if you need to keep the original list unchanged, you should make a copy of the list before shuffling:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef randomize_list(strings):\n    randomized_strings = strings[:]  # Make a copy of the list\n    random.shuffle(randomized_strings)\n    return randomized_strings\n```\n\nThis approach is efficient and clean, utilizing Python's built-in capabilities to achieve the desired result."
