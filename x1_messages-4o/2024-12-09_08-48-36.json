Here's a sample query that demonstrates this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT salary\nFROM Employee\nORDER BY salary DESC\nLIMIT 5;\n```\n\nThis query selects the `salary` column from the `Employee` table, orders the results in descending order (from highest to lowest salary), and limits the output to the top 5 entries. This will give you the 5 highest salaries in the table. If you want to see additional columns, such as employee names or IDs, simply include those in the `SELECT` statement as needed."
