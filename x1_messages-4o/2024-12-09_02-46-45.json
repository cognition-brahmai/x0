The code is as follows:\n\n```python\nfor n in range(2, 10):\n    for x in range(2, n):\n        if n % x == 0:\n            print(n, 'equals', x, '*', n//x)\n            break\n    else:\n        # loop fell through without finding a factor\n        print(n, 'is a prime number')\n```\nI understand that '==' is used for testing equality, but I am not clear about the usage of '%' in the 'if n % x' part. Can you explain what does 'if n % x' actually signify in this context?"

        "content": "Certainly! In Python, the percentage sign `%` is used as the modulus operator. It returns the remainder of the division between two numbers. In the context of your code, `n % x` calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by `x`.\n\nThe `if n % x == 0:` statement is checking whether `n` is evenly divisible by `x`. If `n % x` equals `0`, it means that `n` divided by `x` leaves no remainder, which indicates that `x` is a factor of `n`.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how this code works to find prime numbers:\n\n1. The outer `for` loop iterates over each number `n` from 2 to 9.\n\n2. The inner `for` loop checks each number `x` from 2 to `n-1` to see if `x` is a factor of `n`.\n\n3. The `if n % x == 0:` condition checks if `n` is evenly divisible by `x`. If this condition is true, it means that `n` is not a prime number because it has a divisor other than 1 and itself, and the code prints that `n` equals `x` times `n // x`.\n\n4. The `break` statement exits the inner loop as soon as a factor is found, indicating that `n` is not a prime number.\n\n5. The `else` block associated with the `for` loop (not the `if` statement) runs if the loop completes without breaking, meaning no factors were found and `n` is a prime number. The code then prints that `n` is a prime number.\n\nSo, the modulus operator `%` is crucial in determining whether `n` has factors other than 1 and itself, which helps in identifying prime numbers."
