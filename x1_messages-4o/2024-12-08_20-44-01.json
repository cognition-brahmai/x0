Here are two ways humans can reduce their impact on the environment:\n\n1. **Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle**: By minimizing waste, reusing products, and recycling materials, individuals can significantly reduce the amount of trash that ends up in landfills and decrease the demand for new resources. This approach helps conserve energy, reduce pollution, and conserve natural resources.\n\n2. **Adopt Sustainable Transportation**: Opting for public transportation, carpooling, biking, or walking instead of using individual cars can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and decrease air pollution. Additionally, investing in electric or hybrid vehicles can also contribute to a reduction in fossil fuel consumption."
