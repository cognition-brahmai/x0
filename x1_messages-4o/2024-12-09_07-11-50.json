I tried using the following code:\n\n```python\ndf.apply(lambda x: x.astype(str).str.lower())\n```\n\nHowever, the 'url' variable values remain the same and are not converted to lower case. What am I doing wrong?"

        "content": "The issue with your code is that you are applying the `apply` function to the entire DataFrame without specifying which column you want to transform. As a result, it is attempting to apply the transformation to both columns, which may not give the desired effect.\n\nTo specifically convert only the 'url' column to lowercase, you should directly target that column in the DataFrame. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndf['url'] = df['url'].str.lower()\n```\n\nThis code accesses the 'url' column of the DataFrame `df` and applies the `str.lower()` method to convert all the domain names to lowercase. After executing this line, the 'url' column will have all its values in lowercase."
