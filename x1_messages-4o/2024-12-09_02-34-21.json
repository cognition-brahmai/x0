        "content": "To calculate precision and recall from a confusion matrix, you need to understand the components of the matrix:\n\n1. **True Positives (TP):** The number of correctly predicted positive cases.\n2. **False Positives (FP):** The number of incorrectly predicted positive cases (actual negatives predicted as positives).\n3. **True Negatives (TN):** The number of correctly predicted negative cases.\n4. **False Negatives (FN):** The number of incorrectly predicted negative cases (actual positives predicted as negatives).\n\nThese components are generally arranged in a matrix as follows:\n\n```\n          Predicted\n           Yes    No\nActual  Yes  [TP]  [FN]\n        No   [FP]  [TN]\n```\n\n### Precision and Recall\n\n- **Precision:** It tells us how many of the predicted positive instances are actually positive.\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Precision} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP}\n  \\]\n\n- **Recall (Sensitivity or True Positive Rate):** It tells us how many of the actual positive instances were correctly predicted.\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Recall} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN}\n  \\]\n\n### Steps to Calculate\n\n1. **Identify TP, FP, FN, and TN from the confusion matrix:**\n   - True Positives (TP) are the cases that are correctly identified as positive.\n   - False Positives (FP) are the cases that are incorrectly identified as positive.\n   - True Negatives (TN) are the cases that are correctly identified as negative.\n   - False Negatives (FN) are the cases that are incorrectly identified as negative.\n\n2. **Apply the formulas:**\n\n   - For **Precision**, divide the number of True Positives by the sum of True Positives and False Positives.\n   - For **Recall**, divide the number of True Positives by the sum of True Positives and False Negatives.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's assume a confusion matrix:\n\n```\n          Predicted\n           Yes    No\nActual  Yes  50    10\n        No   5     100\n```\n\n- **TP = 50, FP = 5, FN = 10, TN = 100**\n\n- **Precision:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Precision} = \\frac{50}{50 + 5} = \\frac{50}{55} \\approx 0.909\n  \\]\n\n- **Recall:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Recall} = \\frac{50}{50 + 10} = \\frac{50}{60} \\approx 0.833\n  \\]\n\nBy using these steps, you can calculate precision and recall for any confusion matrix, including the ones in the images you linked. If you provide the specific numbers from your matrix, I can help you calculate the exact precision and recall."
