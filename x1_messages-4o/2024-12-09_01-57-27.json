        "content": "I'm working with keys and dates in Python, where a number of dates can be assigned to one key. I'm using a dictionary of lists of dates to represent this. My current code is as follows:\n\n```python\ndates_dict = dict() \nfor key,  date in cur:\n    if key in dates_dict:\n        dates_dict[key].append(date)\n    else:\n        dates_dict[key] = [date] \n```\nThis works, but I am looking for a more Pythonic solution. I tried the code below, but it throws an error \"NoneType has no attribute append\". Why is this happening and how can I improve my code?\n\n```python\ndates_dict = dict() \nfor key,  date in cur:\n    dates_dict[key] = dates_dict.get(key, []).append(date) \n```\nThe error seems to be related to the output of `print([].append(1))` which is `None`. Can you help explain this?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the way the `append()` method works in Python. The `append()` method modifies the list in place and returns `None`. Therefore, when you do something like `dates_dict.get(key, []).append(date)`, it returns `None` because `append()` doesn't return the modified list; it only modifies it in place.\n\nHere's a more Pythonic way using `collections.defaultdict`, which simplifies this pattern by automatically creating a new list for each new key:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndates_dict = defaultdict(list)\nfor key, date in cur:\n    dates_dict[key].append(date)\n```\n\nIn this version, `defaultdict` automatically initializes a new list for any key that does not exist, so you can directly append to it without needing to check if the key is already in the dictionary.\n\nThis approach is cleaner and more concise, effectively eliminating the need for the `if-else` logic you were using."
