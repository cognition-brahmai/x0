I have the following SQL query which performs a series of left joins on a few tables:\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n<some attributes>\nFROM table1 t1\nINNER JOIN table2 t2\n      ON attr = 1 AND attr2 = 1\nLEFT JOIN table3 t3\n    ON t1.Code = t2.Code AND t3.Date_ = t1.Date_\nLEFT JOIN tabl4 t4\n    ON t4.Code = t1.code AND t4.Date_ = t1.Date_\n```\n\nSo far, I have constructed my SQLAlchemy query as follows:\n\n```python\n(sa.select([idc.c.Code])\n            .select_from(\n                t1.join(t2, and_(t1.c.attr == 1, t2.c.attr2 = 1))\n                .join(t3, t3.c.Code == t1.c.Code)))\n```\n\nHowever, I am struggling to convert the normal join into a left join. Can you guide me on how to do this?"

        "content": "To perform a left join in SQLAlchemy, you can use the `outerjoin` method instead of `join`. Here's how you can convert your SQLAlchemy query to incorporate left joins, based on the SQL query you provided:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import select, and_\n\n# Assuming t1, t2, t3, and t4 are your table objects\n\nquery = (\n    select([t1.c.Code])  # Adjust the selected columns as needed\n    .select_from(\n        t1.join(\n            t2, \n            and_(t1.c.attr == 1, t2.c.attr2 == 1)\n        )\n        .outerjoin(\n            t3, \n            and_(t3.c.Code == t1.c.Code, t3.c.Date_ == t1.c.Date_)\n        )\n        .outerjoin(\n            t4, \n            and_(t4.c.Code == t1.c.Code, t4.c.Date_ == t1.c.Date_)\n        )\n    )\n)\n\n# To execute the query, you would typically use a session object:\n# result = session.execute(query)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- Use `outerjoin` instead of `join` to perform a left join.\n- Ensure that the conditions in the `and_` function match the ones used in your SQL query for each join condition.\n- Adjust the columns being selected within `select([t1.c.Code])` to match your specific requirements, as I have used `t1.c.Code` as a placeholder.\n\nThis should help you translate your SQL query with left joins into a SQLAlchemy query."
