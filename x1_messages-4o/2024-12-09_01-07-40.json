Has anyone been able to successfully install pyodbc on Mavericks? Are there any known workarounds for this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering indicates that the `sql.h` header file, which is part of the ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) development headers, is missing. To successfully install `pyodbc` on macOS Mavericks (10.9), you'll need to install the ODBC development headers. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Install unixODBC**: You need to have the unixODBC development libraries installed. You can do this using Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. If you haven't installed Homebrew yet, you can do so by following the instructions on [Homebrew's website](https://brew.sh/).\n\n   Once Homebrew is installed, run the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew install unixodbc\n   ```\n\n   This command will install unixODBC, which includes the necessary `sql.h` file.\n\n2. **Set Environment Variables**: After installing unixODBC, you might need to set environment variables so that the pyodbc setup can locate the ODBC headers and libraries. You can do this by adding the following lines to your `.bash_profile` (or `.zshrc` if you're using zsh):\n\n   ```bash\n   export CFLAGS=\"-I/usr/local/include\"\n   export LDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/local/lib\"\n   ```\n\n   Then, apply the changes by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bash_profile\n   ```\n\n3. **Install pyodbc**: Now you should be able to install pyodbc via pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pyodbc\n   ```\n\nThese steps should allow you to successfully compile and install pyodbc on macOS Mavericks. If you still encounter issues, ensure that your Xcode Command Line Tools are installed and up to date, as they provide the necessary build tools. You can install or update them using:\n\n```bash\nxcode-select --install\n```\n\nAfter following these steps, the installation of pyodbc should complete without errors."
