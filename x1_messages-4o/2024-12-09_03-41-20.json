        "content": "When you're using Python's debugger (`pdb`), sometimes it might truncate the exception message when it's displayed. To see the full details of an exception while using `pdb`, you can capture the exception object and then access its attributes to get the complete message. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef some_function():\n    raise Exception('An exception message with valuable information.')\n\nimport pdb; pdb.set_trace()\n\ntry:\n    some_function()\nexcept Exception as e:\n    # Use the exception object 'e' to get the full message\n    print(f\"Exception occurred: {e}\")\n    # If you want to inspect the traceback or other details, you can do so here\n    import traceback\n    traceback.print_exc()\n```\n\nIn `pdb`, when you hit the breakpoint or the exception, you can still interact with the exception object by printing it or by using the `traceback` module to get more detailed information.\n\n1. **Print the Exception**: You can print the exception object `e` which will give you the full message.\n   \n   ```shell\n   (Pdb) print(e)\n   An exception message with valuable information.\n   ```\n\n2. **Use Traceback**: You can also use `traceback.print_exc()` to print the full traceback, which will include the complete exception message.\n\nBy capturing the exception in the `except` block, you have full control over how you want to display or log the exception message and its details. This approach also allows you to inspect other attributes of the exception, should you need them."
