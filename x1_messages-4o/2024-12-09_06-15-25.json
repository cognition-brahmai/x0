I've noticed with the code:\n\n```python\ndef foo(): return 3\nif foo > 8:\n    launch_the_nukes()\n```\n\nI accidentally executed the function due to a typo. My understanding is that `E > F` is equivalent to `(E).__gt__(F)` and for well behaved classes (such as builtins) it's equivalent to `(F).__lt__(E)`. If the `__lt__` or `__gt__` operators don't exist, I believe Python uses `__cmp__`. However, these methods don't work with `function` objects while the `<` and `>` operators do work. What is happening under the hood that makes this happen?\n\nFor example, check the following code:\n\n```python\n>>> foo > 9e9\nTrue\n>>> (foo).__gt__(9e9)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nAttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute '__gt__'\n>>> (9e9).__lt__(foo)\nNotImplemented\n```"

        "content": "In Python 2.7.5, the comparison operators `<` and `>` can behave unexpectedly when used with certain operand types, such as functions, due to the way Python handles object comparisons by default.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening:\n\n1. **Function Objects**: In Python, functions are objects, and when you compare them using `<` or `>`, Python doesn't have a meaningful way to compare them based on their value or functionality because they are not inherently comparable.\n\n2. **Default Comparison**: If you attempt to compare objects that do not have the appropriate comparison methods (`__lt__`, `__gt__`, etc.), Python falls back on comparing object IDs. This is essentially comparing the memory addresses of these objects. Since every object has a unique ID, the comparison will not usually raise an error unless explicitly disabled or overridden in custom classes.\n\n3. **The Example Code**:\n   - When you write `foo > 8`, Python is comparing the `foo` function object with the integer `8`. Since `foo` is an object and Python does not find a specific comparison implementation for this, it defaults to comparing their IDs.\n   - Similarly, when you write `foo > 9e9`, Python again falls back on comparing the ID of `foo` with the ID of the float `9e9`.\n\n4. **Lack of `__gt__` Method**: In your example, `(foo).__gt__(9e9)` raises an `AttributeError` because Python function objects do not have a `__gt__` method. The same goes for `9e9.__lt__(foo)` returning `NotImplemented` because floats do not know how to handle comparison with function objects.\n\n5. **Historical Note**: In Python 3, this behavior was changed. Explicit comparison between non-comparable types raises a `TypeError` instead of falling back to ID comparison, which is considered safer and more predictable.\n\nTo avoid such issues, ensure that your comparisons are between comparable types, and be clear about the expected behavior when designing your code logic. If you need to compare functions in any meaningful way, you should define what that means in your context and implement appropriate methods or comparisons."
