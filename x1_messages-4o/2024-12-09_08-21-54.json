        "content": "In Keras' `model.summary()`, the term \"None\" signifies an unspecified dimension, which typically refers to the batch size. When you see an output shape like `(None, 100)`, the \"None\" represents the batch size, meaning that the model can accept any number of samples in a batch when making predictions or during training.\n\nThe dimension \"100\" in this context would be the size of the output for each sample in the batch. So, the shape `(None, 100)` tells you that each sample will have an output of size 100, but the number of such samples in a batch is not fixed and can vary. This design allows flexibility in terms of how many samples you can feed into the model at once."
