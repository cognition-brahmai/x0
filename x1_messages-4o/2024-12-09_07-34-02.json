My code uses the 'startswith' function, but it's causing a 'TypeError: startswith first arg must be bytes or a tuple of bytes, not str'. According to the Python documentation, the first argument to 'startswith' should be a string. Why am I getting this error and how can I fix it? Here is my code:\n\n```python\ndef readFasta(filename):\n    \"\"\" Reads a sequence in Fasta format \"\"\"\n    fp = open(filename, 'rb')\n    header = \"\"\n    seq = \"\"\n    while True:\n        line = fp.readline()\n        if (line == \"\"):\n            break\n        if (line.startswith('&gt;')):\n            header = line[1:].strip()\n        else:\n            seq = fp.read().replace('\\n','')\n            seq = seq.replace('\\r','')          # for windows\n            break\n    fp.close()\n    return (header, seq)\n\nFASTAsequence = readFasta(\"MusChr01.fa\")\n```\n\nThe error I'm getting is:\n\n```python\nTypeError: startswith first arg must be bytes or a tuple of bytes, not str\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that you're opening the file in binary mode (`'rb'`), which means that each line read from the file will be a bytes object rather than a string. The `startswith` method for a bytes object requires its argument to also be a bytes object, not a string.\n\nTo fix this, you need to modify your code so that it handles the bytes correctly. You can either decode the bytes to a string or modify the `startswith` argument to be a bytes literal. Here's an updated version of your code:\n\n```python\ndef readFasta(filename):\n    \"\"\" Reads a sequence in Fasta format \"\"\"\n    with open(filename, 'rb') as fp:\n        header = \"\"\n        seq = \"\"\n        while True:\n            line = fp.readline()\n            if not line:\n                break\n            if line.startswith(b'>'):  # Use bytes literal here\n                header = line[1:].decode('utf-8').strip()  # Decode bytes to string\n            else:\n                seq = line + fp.read()  # Read the rest of the file\n                seq = seq.replace(b'\\n', b'')  # Replace bytes with bytes\n                seq = seq.replace(b'\\r', b'')  # Replace bytes with bytes\n                seq = seq.decode('utf-8')  # Decode the final sequence\n                break\n    return header, seq\n\nFASTAsequence = readFasta(\"MusChr01.fa\")\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n1. **Reading and Decoding**: Each line is read as bytes, and when necessary, it's decoded to a string using `.decode('utf-8')`. This is particularly important for the header and final sequence processing.\n\n2. **Bytes Literal**: The `startswith(b'>')` check is done using a bytes literal.\n\n3. **Reading the Sequence**: The sequence is read and processed as bytes, with newline or carriage return bytes being replaced appropriately before decoding the entire sequence to a string.\n\nThese changes should resolve the `TypeError` and allow your code to correctly read and process the Fasta file."
