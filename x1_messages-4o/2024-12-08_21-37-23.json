Provide a visualization of the tree and the specific decision criteria used at each node."

        "content": "To create a decision tree that classifies the musical genres Punk, Jazz, and Heavy Metal based on their defining characteristics, we need to identify the unique features that distinguish each genre. Here's a textual representation of how the decision tree might look:\n\n1. **Root Node:** \n   - **Instrument Focus:** Does the music prominently feature brass and woodwind instruments?\n     - **Yes:** Go to Jazz\n     - **No:** Proceed to next node\n\n2. **Node 1:** \n   - **Guitar Riffs:** Are the guitar riffs distorted and loud?\n     - **Yes:** Go to Heavy Metal\n     - **No:** Proceed to next node\n\n3. **Node 2:** \n   - **Lyrics Theme:** Do the lyrics focus on anti-establishment and social commentary?\n     - **Yes:** Go to Punk\n     - **No:** Further analysis may be required, but based on the provided characteristics, it defaults to Punk if none of the above conditions are met.\n\nThis decision tree uses three main criteria based on the defining characteristics of each genre: instrument focus, guitar riff style, and lyrical themes.\n\nTo visualize this:\n\n```\n                    Instrument Focus?\n                   /                 \\\n          Brass/Woodwind?

Each node represents a specific question that helps classify the genre, and the leaves represent the final classification."
