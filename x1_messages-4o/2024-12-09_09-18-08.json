        "content": "To search for values of a specific key in a given dictionary in Python, you can simply access the value using the key. If you want to handle cases where the key might not exist in the dictionary, you can use the `get()` method. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Sample dictionary\nmy_dict = {\n    'name': 'Alice',\n    'age': 25,\n    'location': 'New York'\n}\n\n# Key you want to search for\nkey_to_search = 'age'\n\n# Method 1: Using direct access (may raise KeyError if key doesn't exist)\ntry:\n    value = my_dict[key_to_search]\n    print(f\"The value for key '{key_to_search}' is: {value}\")\nexcept KeyError:\n    print(f\"The key '{key_to_search}' does not exist in the dictionary.\")\n\n# Method 2: Using the get() method (returns None if key doesn't exist)\nvalue = my_dict.get(key_to_search)\nif value is not None:\n    print(f\"The value for key '{key_to_search}' is: {value}\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"The key '{key_to_search}' does not exist in the dictionary.\")\n```\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates two methods to search for the value of a specific key in a dictionary. The first method uses direct access and handles potential `KeyError` exceptions, while the second method uses `get()` to safely retrieve the value or return `None` if the key doesn't exist."
