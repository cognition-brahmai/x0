        "content": "The error message you're encountering indicates that the `virtualenvwrapper` module isn't installed for the Python version you're using. This is a common issue when upgrading operating systems, as some dependencies may not carry over. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify Python Version:**\n   Ensure that you're using the correct version of Python. Sometimes, an upgrade can change the default Python version.\n\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   ```\n\n2. **Install `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper`:**\n   You may need to reinstall `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper` using `pip`. \n\n   ```bash\n   sudo pip install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper\n   ```\n\n   If you don't have `pip` installed, you can install it using:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo easy_install pip\n   ```\n\n3. **Check PATH Variables:**\n   Ensure that your PATH is set correctly for Python and `virtualenvwrapper`. You can add these lines to your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc` file, depending on your shell:\n\n   ```bash\n   export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs\n   export PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/Devel\n   export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python\n   source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh\n   ```\n\n   Adjust the paths if your `virtualenvwrapper.sh` is located elsewhere.\n\n4. **Reload Shell Configuration:**\n   After modifying your shell configuration file, reload it:\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bash_profile\n   # or\n   source ~/.zshrc\n   ```\n\n5. **Check Installation:**\n   After following the above steps, test the installation by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   mkvirtualenv test_env\n   ```\n\n   If it works without issues, your setup is correct.\n\n6. **Troubleshooting:**\n   - If you encounter permission issues, consider using a virtual environment manager like `pyenv` to manage different Python versions and environments without requiring `sudo`.\n   - Ensure that the correct Python executable is being used. You can specify the Python path by setting the `VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON` variable as shown above.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with `virtualenvwrapper` on your OSX Mavericks system."
