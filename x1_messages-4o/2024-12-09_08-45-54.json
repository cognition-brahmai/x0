        "content": "To modify the `Referer` URL when making a GET request using the `requests` library in Python, you can add a custom header to your request. The `Referer` header is part of the HTTP headers that can be set to indicate the address of the previous web page from which a link to the currently requested page was followed. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# URL of the target webpage\nurl = 'https://example.com'\n\n# Custom Referer URL\nreferer_url = 'https://your-referer-url.com'\n\n# Set the headers with the custom Referer\nheaders = {\n    'Referer': referer_url\n}\n\n# Make the GET request with the custom Referer header\nresponse = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n\n# Print the response content or status code\nprint(response.status_code)\nprint(response.text)\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, replace `'https://example.com'` with the URL of the webpage you're making the GET request to, and `'https://your-referer-url.com'` with the referer URL you want to set. The `headers` dictionary allows you to specify custom headers for your request, including the `Referer`. This header is then passed along with the GET request, and you can handle the response as needed."
