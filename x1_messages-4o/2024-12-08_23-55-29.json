Here are two examples:\n\n1. **Email Spam Detection**: The task is to classify emails into two categories: \"Spam\" or \"Not Spam\" (also known as \"Ham\"). The model analyzes features such as email content, sender information, and metadata to determine whether an email is likely to be spam.\n\n2. **Medical Diagnosis for a Specific Disease**: For instance, predicting whether a patient has a particular disease (e.g., diabetes) or not. The model uses various patient data, such as medical history, test results, and symptoms, to classify whether the patient is positive or negative for the disease."
