Then, subtract the number of letters in the word \"movie\" from that result. \nNext, take the current year and add the number of days in the month of February. Divide that sum by the number of letters in the name of the lead actor or actress. \nFinally, combine the two results to form the name of the movie. Good luck!"

        "content": "Let's decode the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **First Calculation:**\n   - Number of letters in \"romantic\" = 8\n   - Number of vowels in \"comedy\" = 3 (o, e)\n   - Multiply: 8 * 3 = 24\n   - Number of letters in \"movie\" = 5\n   - Subtract: 24 - 5 = 19\n\n2. **Second Calculation:**\n   - Current year = 2023\n   - Number of days in February (2023 is not a leap year) = 28\n   - Sum: 2023 + 28 = 2051\n   - The name of the lead actor or actress is not provided, so let's assume the name has, for example, 10 letters. (Note: This is hypothetical as the exact name is not given in the puzzle.)\n   - Divide: 2051 / 10 = 205.1\n\n3. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Combine 19 and 205.1 to form \"19205.1\"\n\nThe instructions to form the name of the movie are not fully clear in terms of how to use the combined results numerically to form a movie title. The puzzle might be missing some information on how to map these results to a specific movie title. If you have additional details or hints, please provide them for further assistance."
