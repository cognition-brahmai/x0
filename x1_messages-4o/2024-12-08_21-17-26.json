Below is a simple Java program that subtracts 5 from the variable `x`, which is initially assigned the value of 12, and then prints the result:\n\n```java\npublic class SubtractFive {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int x = 12; // Initial value of x\n        int result = x - 5; // Subtract 5 from x\n        System.out.println(\"The result of subtracting 5 from \" + x + \" is: \" + result);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output:\n\n```\nThe result of subtracting 5 from 12 is: 7\n```\n\nThis program initializes `x` with the value of 12, performs the subtraction, and then prints the result."
