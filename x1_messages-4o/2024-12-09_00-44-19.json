I am not sure what I am doing wrong.

        "content": "The errors you're encountering are due to incorrect usage of the `pickle.loads` and `pickle.load` functions. Let's address these issues:\n\n1. **`pickle.loads` Error**: The `pickle.loads` function is used to deserialize a pickled object that is in the form of a byte string. However, in your code, you are passing a string that represents a file path instead of the actual byte content. This is why you are encountering the `TypeError: 'str' does not support the buffer interface`.\n\n2. **`pickle.load` Error**: The `pickle.load` function requires a file-like object with a `read` method, not a string. You should open the file in binary read mode and then pass the file object to `pickle.load`.\n\nHere's how you can correct the code to properly load the pickled object:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport pickle\nimport urllib.request\n\n# Assuming this is part of a larger function or script\nelif str(parser) == \"SwissWithdrawn_Parser\":\n    print(\"Gathering SwissProt update info...\")\n    cache_hits = 0\n    cache_misses = 0\n    files = set()\n\n    for f in os.listdir(\"out/cache/\"):\n        if os.path.isfile(\"out/cache/\" + f):\n            files.add(f)\n\n    for name in sp_lost_names:\n        cached = False\n        url = (\n            \"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=mnemonic%3a\"\n            + name\n            + \"+active%3ayes&amp;format=tab&amp;columns=entry%20name\"\n        )\n        hashed_url = str(hash(url))\n\n        if hashed_url in files:\n            cached = True\n            cache_hits += 1\n            with open(\"out/cache/\" + hashed_url, \"rb\") as fp:\n                content_list = pickle.load(fp)  # Correct usage of pickle.load\n        else:\n            cache_misses += 1\n            with urllib.request.urlopen(url) as response:\n                content_list = [x.decode().strip() for x in response.readlines()]\n\n            with open(\"out/cache/\" + hashed_url, \"wb\") as fp:\n                pickle.dump(content_list, fp)\n\n        if not content_list:\n            change_log[\"swiss-names\"] = {name: \"withdrawn\"}\n        else:\n            new_name = content_list[1]\n            change_log[\"swiss-names\"] = {name: new_name}\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- **Opening Files in Binary Mode**: When you want to load or dump a pickled object, always open the file in binary mode ('rb' for reading and 'wb' for writing).\n- **Proper Use of `pickle.load`**: Ensure that you pass a file object (opened in 'rb' mode) to `pickle.load`, not a file path or any other string.\n- **Reading from URL**: Ensure you read the content from the URL correctly and decode it if necessary.\n\nThese changes should resolve the errors you are encountering."
