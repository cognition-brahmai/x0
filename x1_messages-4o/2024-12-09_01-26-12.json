The error message I'm receiving is a KeyError: 'PROJ_LIB'. This is confusing because the same script runs correctly in Jupyter or Spyder! The environment in PyCharm is ../anaconda3/lib/python3.6, which is the same as in Anaconda. Has anyone encountered this error before and how can it be resolved?\n\nStack trace:\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"/Users/yupeipei/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py\", line 2963, in run_code\n    exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)\n  File \"<ipython-input-4-0a24a3a77efd>\", line 7, in <module>\n    from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap\n  File \"/Applications/PyCharm.app/Contents/helpers/pydev/_pydev_bundle/pydev_import_hook.py\", line 20, in do_import\n    module = self._system_import(name, *args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/Users/yupeipei/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mpl_toolkits/basemap/__init__.py\", line 146, in <module>\n    pyproj_datadir = os.environ['PROJ_LIB']\n  File \"/Users/yupeipei/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/os.py\", line 669, in __getitem__\n    raise KeyError(key) from None\nKeyError: 'PROJ_LIB'\n```"

        "content": "The `KeyError: 'PROJ_LIB'` error you\u2019re encountering indicates that the environment variable `PROJ_LIB` is not set. This variable is required by the `Basemap` package to locate the projection data files it needs.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Identify the PROJ_LIB Path:**\n   First, you need to find the location of the PROJ data directory. This is typically located within your Anaconda environment. You can find it by executing the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda info --envs\n   ```\n\n   Then activate your environment and run:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda list proj\n   ```\n\n   This will show you the version and path where `proj` is installed. The `PROJ_LIB` directory is often found in a path like `.../share/proj`.\n\n2. **Set the PROJ_LIB Environment Variable:**\n   Once you have the path, you need to set this path as the `PROJ_LIB` environment variable. You can do this by adding the following lines to your script before importing `Basemap`, or by setting these variables in your PyCharm environment:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   os.environ['PROJ_LIB'] = '/path/to/your/proj_data'\n   ```\n\n   Replace `'/path/to/your/proj_data'` with the actual path you found in the previous step.\n\n3. **Set Environment Variable in PyCharm:**\n   Alternatively, you can set the environment variable directly in PyCharm:\n   - Go to `Run` > `Edit Configurations...`.\n   - Select your script from the list.\n   - In the `Environment variables` field, add `PROJ_LIB=/path/to/your/proj_data`.\n\n4. **Install Basemap using Conda (if not already):**\n   Ensure that `Basemap` is installed using `conda` as it handles dependencies better. Use:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda install -c conda-forge basemap\n   ```\n\n5. **Restart PyCharm:**\n   Sometimes simply restarting the IDE can resolve environment variable issues.\n\nBy setting the `PROJ_LIB` environment variable, the `Basemap` package should be able to locate the necessary projection files, and the error should be resolved."
