When I use the following code, I want to see the plots and print statements interlaced. However, all the print statements are displayed first and then all the plots. Is there a direct solution in Ipython, or a workaround or alternate solution to get the interlaced output?\n\n```python\n%matplotlib inline\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ni = 0\nfor data in manydata:\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n    print \"data number i =\", i\n    ax.hist(data)\n    i = i + 1\n```\n\nDesired output:\n\n```python\ndata number i = 0\n(histogram plot)\ndata number i = 1\n(histogram plot)\n...\n```\n\nActual output:\n\n```python\ndata number i = 0\ndata number i = 1\n...\n(histogram plot)\n(histogram plot)\n...\n```\nI am launching ipython with `ipython notebook --no-browser --no-mathjax`."

        "content": "To achieve the interlaced output of print statements and plots in an IPython notebook, you can use the `IPython.display` module to explicitly display the plots at the point of their creation. By using `display` and `clear_output`, you can control when the plot is rendered. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired effect:\n\n```python\n%matplotlib inline\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom IPython.display import display, clear_output\n\ni = 0\nfor data in manydata:\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n    print(\"data number i =\", i)\n    ax.hist(data)\n    # Use display to show the plot immediately\n    display(fig)\n    # Clear the output to mimic interlacing\n    clear_output(wait=True)\n    i += 1\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`display(fig)`**: This command explicitly displays the figure at the point in the loop where it is called. This forces the figure to be rendered in the output cell immediately after the print statement.\n\n2. **`clear_output(wait=True)`**: This command is used to clear the output of the cell, which helps in creating the effect of interlaced display by ensuring that each plot and its corresponding print statement are shown before moving on to the next iteration.\n\n3. **`%matplotlib inline`**: Ensures that plots are rendered inline in the notebook. This is generally included as a magic command at the beginning of the notebook.\n\nBy using these functions, you can achieve an interlaced effect where each print statement is followed by its corresponding plot, as desired."
