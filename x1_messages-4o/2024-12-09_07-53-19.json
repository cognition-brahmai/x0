The line `django>=1.10,<1.11` in your `requirements.txt` file specifies that the Django version for your project should be greater than or equal to 1.10 but less than 1.11. This means you are specifying a version range that includes all versions of Django starting from 1.10 up to, but not including, 1.11. Essentially, it restricts the Django version to any release within the 1.10.x series."
