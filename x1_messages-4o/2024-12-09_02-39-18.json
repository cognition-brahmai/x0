Usually, I launch Eclipse with sage environment variables from the command line using the following commands:\n\n```bash\nsage -sh\ncd /path/to/eclipse\n./eclipse\n```\n\nThe first line loads the sage environment variables and the remaining commands launch Eclipse. I am looking for a similar way to launch PyCharm from the command line. I have been using a Mac and Ubuntu for sage development, and I need commands that are compatible with both operating systems. I found two links that seem to offer solutions, but I can't find a pyCharm.sh file as suggested in Link 1, and the instructions in Link 2 from JetBrains are not clear. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To launch PyCharm with Sage environment variables from the command line on both Mac and Ubuntu, you can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Locate PyCharm Executable\n\nFirst, you need to locate the PyCharm executable on your system. This can vary depending on how PyCharm was installed.\n\n- **On Ubuntu:** If you installed PyCharm using Snap, the executable is typically located at `/snap/bin/pycharm-community` or `/snap/bin/pycharm-professional`. If you used the JetBrains Toolbox or a direct download, it might be somewhere like `~/bin/pycharm/bin/pycharm.sh`.\n\n- **On macOS:** If you installed PyCharm using the JetBrains Toolbox, it might be located in `~/Applications/JetBrains Toolbox/PyCharm.app/Contents/MacOS/pycharm`. If installed manually, it might be in `/Applications/PyCharm.app/Contents/MacOS/pycharm`.\n\n### Step 2: Create a Launch Script\n\nCreate a script that will load the Sage environment and then start PyCharm. Here's a generic example:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Load Sage environment\nsage -sh <<EOF\n\n# Launch PyCharm\n/path/to/pycharm/executable \"$@\"\n\nEOF\n```\n\nReplace `/path/to/pycharm/executable` with the path to the PyCharm executable you found in Step 1. Save this script as something like `launch_pycharm_with_sage.sh`.\n\n### Step 3: Make the Script Executable\n\nRun the following command to make your script executable:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x launch_pycharm_with_sage.sh\n```\n\n### Step 4: Run the Script\n\nNow, you can use this script to launch PyCharm with Sage environment variables:\n\n```bash\n./launch_pycharm_with_sage.sh\n```\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Environment Variables:** Ensure that the Sage environment variables are correctly loaded. You can test this by running a simple Sage command after `sage -sh` to see if the environment is properly set up.\n\n- **Passing Arguments:** The `\"$@\"` in the script allows you to pass any additional arguments to PyCharm if needed.\n\n- **Customizing for Different Platforms:** You might want to adjust the script slightly depending on whether you're running it on macOS or Ubuntu, especially considering the path differences.\n\nThis approach gives you a flexible way to launch PyCharm with the necessary environment configuration for Sage development on both macOS and Ubuntu."
