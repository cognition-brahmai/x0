The code I'm using is `file = open(base_dir + \"/\" + path, 'wb')`, `data =  Blob(path, bucket).download_as_string()`, and `file.write(data)`. However, the data that I've uploaded is stored inside folders in the bucket and when the Google library attempts to download the file, it makes a GET request that turns the path into a URL, such as `https://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/bucket/o/folder%2Finnerfolder%2Ffile.jpg`. How can I prevent this from happening and successfully download the file?"

        "content": "When you use Google Cloud Storage's Python client library to download a file, the library should handle paths correctly, including those with nested folders. However, it seems like you might be encountering an issue with URL encoding.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step guide to ensure you are downloading files correctly from Google Cloud Storage:\n\n1. **Ensure you have the correct library installed**: Make sure you're using the `google-cloud-storage` library.\n\n2. **Initialize the client and get the bucket**:\n   Ensure you have initialized the client and have access to the bucket correctly.\n\n   ```python\n   from google.cloud import storage\n\n   # Initialize a client\n   client = storage.Client()\n\n   # Get the bucket\n   bucket = client.get_bucket('your-bucket-name')\n   ```\n\n3. **Access the blob and download it**:\n   To download a file, you need to access the blob and then download it to your desired location.\n\n   ```python\n   def download_blob(bucket_name, source_blob_name, destination_file_name):\n       \"\"\"Downloads a blob from the bucket.\"\"\"\n       # The ID of your GCS bucket\n       # bucket_name = \"your-bucket-name\"\n\n       # The ID of your GCS object\n       # source_blob_name = \"storage-object-name\"\n\n       # The path to which the file should be downloaded\n       # destination_file_name = \"local/path/to/file\"\n\n       storage_client = storage.Client()\n\n       bucket = storage_client.bucket(bucket_name)\n       blob = bucket.blob(source_blob_name)\n       blob.download_to_filename(destination_file_name)\n\n       print(\n           f\"Blob {source_blob_name} downloaded to {destination_file_name}.\"\n       )\n\n   # Call the function with appropriate parameters\n   download_blob('your-bucket-name', 'folder/innerfolder/file.jpg', '/local/path/to/file.jpg')\n   ```\n\n4. **Avoid URL encoding issues**:\n   When specifying the path to the file in the bucket (`source_blob_name` in the example), use the exact path as it appears in the bucket, including any folder names. The library should handle the URL encoding for you.\n\n5. **Check permissions**:\n   Ensure that the service account or user you're using has the necessary permissions to access the bucket and download files.\n\n6. **Handle credentials properly**:\n   If you're running this code outside of Google Cloud (like on your local machine), ensure you have authenticated properly using a service account key JSON file or by other means provided by Google Cloud SDK.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to download files from Google Cloud Storage, even if they are located within nested folders."
