I am planning to use feature selection methods and model parameter setting methods provided by scikit-learn. If I am using univariate feature selection, I understand that I should perform feature selection first and, with the selected features, tune the parameters of the estimator. However, if I want to use recursive feature elimination, should I first set the parameters with grid search using all the original features and then perform feature selection? Alternatively, should I select the features first (with the estimator's default parameters) and then set the parameters with the selected features? I am looking for a solution to this, as referenced in this [link](http://www.mail-archive.com/scikit-learn-general@lists.sourceforge.net/msg02355.html)."

        "content": "When dealing with recursive feature elimination (RFE) and parameter tuning in scikit-learn, there are a few approaches to consider. The order of operations can indeed impact your results, so it's important to choose a strategy that best suits your specific problem and dataset. Here's a breakdown of two common approaches:\n\n1. **Parameter Tuning First, Then RFE:**\n   - **Step 1:** Perform a grid search (or any hyperparameter tuning strategy) on the entire feature set using the estimator to find the best hyperparameters. \n   - **Step 2:** With the tuned parameters, apply RFE to select the best subset of features.\n   - **Pros:** This approach ensures that the feature selection process is done with the best possible model configuration, potentially leading to better feature subset selection.\n   - **Cons:** It can be computationally expensive since you initially search over the entire feature set.\n\n2. **RFE First, Then Parameter Tuning:**\n   - **Step 1:** Use RFE with the estimator\u2019s default parameters to select a subset of features.\n   - **Step 2:** Perform a grid search (or other tuning) on this reduced feature set to find the best hyperparameters.\n   - **Pros:** This approach can be more efficient since the grid search is done on a smaller feature set.\n   - **Cons:** The initial RFE might not select the optimal set of features because it is based on default parameters, which might not be the best configuration for your model.\n\n3. **Nested Cross-Validation with RFE and Grid Search:**\n   - Use nested cross-validation, where the inner loop performs RFE for feature selection and parameter tuning together, while the outer loop evaluates model performance.\n   - **Pros:** Provides an unbiased estimate of model performance since both feature selection and parameter tuning are cross-validated.\n   - **Cons:** Computationally intensive, but it is often the most robust approach.\n\n### Recommended Approach:\nIf computational resources allow, the nested cross-validation approach is ideal because it ensures that both feature selection and parameter tuning are optimally integrated and validated. However, if resources are limited, you might start with parameter tuning first to ensure the RFE process benefits from a well-tuned model.\n\n### Practical Tips:\n- Use stratified cross-validation if your dataset is imbalanced.\n- Consider using `RFECV` for recursive feature elimination with cross-validation, which automatically tunes the number of features to select.\n- Always evaluate the model's performance on a separate test set to ensure generalization.\n\nUltimately, the choice of strategy may depend on the specific characteristics of your dataset and the goals of your analysis."
