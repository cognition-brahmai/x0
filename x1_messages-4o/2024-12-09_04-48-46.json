        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The `ImportError: cannot import name HTTPSHandler` typically indicates an issue with your Python installation, specifically related to the SSL support. This can happen if Python was built without SSL support or if there's an issue with the SSL module in your Python environment. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify OpenSSL Installation:**\n   Ensure that OpenSSL is installed on your system. You can check this by running:\n   ```bash\n   openssl version\n   ```\n\n   If OpenSSL is not installed, you can install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install libssl-dev\n   ```\n\n2. **Rebuild Python with SSL Support:**\n   If OpenSSL is installed but Python was built without SSL support, you'll need to rebuild Python:\n   - Download the Python source code for the version you are using.\n   - Navigate to the source directory.\n   - Edit the `Modules/Setup.dist` file and uncomment the lines related to SSL.\n   - Run the following commands:\n     ```bash\n     ./configure\n     make\n     sudo make install\n     ```\n\n3. **Ensure `ssl` Module is Loaded:**\n   Check if the `ssl` module can be imported in Python. Run the following command in Python:\n   ```python\n   import ssl\n   print(ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION)\n   ```\n\n   If this command throws an error, it indicates that the SSL module is not working correctly. Rebuilding Python as described above should fix this.\n\n4. **Upgrade `pip`:**\n   Ensure that you're using the latest version of `pip`, as older versions might have issues with newer systems or Python environments:\n   ```bash\n   python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n   ```\n\n5. **Check Python Environment:**\n   If you're using a virtual environment, make sure the environment is activated before running `pip` commands. If the virtual environment is broken, consider recreating it:\n   ```bash\n   deactivate\n   rm -rf /path/to/your/venv\n   python -m venv /path/to/your/venv\n   source /path/to/your/venv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n6. **Check for System Updates:**\n   Ensure your system is up-to-date, as updates can fix underlying issues:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get upgrade\n   ```\n\nIf these steps do not resolve the issue, consider providing more details about your system setup, such as the operating system version and the Python version, so that more specific advice can be given."
