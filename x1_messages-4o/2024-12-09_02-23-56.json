Here's how you can do it:\n\nFirst, ensure you have imported numpy:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n```\n\nThen, define your matrix and iterate over its columns as follows:\n\n```python\na = np.arange(9).reshape(3, 3)\n\n# Transpose the matrix to swap rows and columns\na_transposed = a.T\n\n# Iterate over the columns (which are now rows in the transposed matrix)\nfor column in a_transposed:\n    print(column)\n```\n\nThe `.T` attribute of a numpy array gives you the transposed version of the array, which effectively switches rows and columns, allowing you to iterate over the columns in the original matrix."
