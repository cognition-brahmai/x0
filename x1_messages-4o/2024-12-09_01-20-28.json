        "content": "The error message you're encountering indicates a mismatch between the versions of `pip` and what the system expects. In this case, it seems like there might be a problem with the installation of `pip` itself, possibly due to an incomplete upgrade or a conflicting version.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Upgrade pip**: Try upgrading `pip` to the latest version. You can do this by running the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install python-pip\n   ```\n\n   Then upgrade `pip` using:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade pip\n   ```\n\n2. **Install pip using `get-pip.py`**: If upgrading pip doesn\u2019t work, you can try reinstalling it using `get-pip.py`. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n   ```bash\n   wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py\n   sudo python get-pip.py\n   ```\n\n   This script will install the latest version of `pip` irrespective of the existing version.\n\n3. **Check for multiple Python versions**: If you have multiple versions of Python installed, ensure that you\u2019re using the right version of `pip` for the Python version you\u2019re working with. For example, if you\u2019re using Python 3, make sure to use `pip3`:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install python3-pip\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify the PATH**: Sometimes, the issue might be due to the system PATH pointing to the wrong `pip` executable. You can check which `pip` is being used by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   which pip\n   ```\n\n   Ensure that it points to the correct location. If it doesn\u2019t, you might need to adjust your PATH or use the full path to the correct `pip` executable.\n\n5. **Remove and Reinstall pip**: As a last resort, you can completely remove `pip` and reinstall it:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get remove python-pip\n   sudo apt-get install python-pip\n   ```\n\n   Or for Python 3:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get remove python3-pip\n   sudo apt-get install python3-pip\n   ```\n\nAfter following these steps, try running your pip commands again to see if the issue is resolved."
