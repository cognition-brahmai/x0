Put your data querying skills to the test by modifying the given code to return the solution. Remember, you need to find the values that are not repeated in the dataset. Good luck!\nDataset: [dataset]\nGiven Code: [for data in dataset:\\n\\tif dataset.count(data)==1:\\n\\t\\tprint(data)]\nHint: Try using a dictionary to keep track of the counts of each value in the dataset."

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. Initialize an empty dictionary to store the counts of each value.\n2. Iterate through the dataset and update the dictionary with the count of each value.\n3. Iterate through the dictionary to find and print values that have a count of 1.\n\nHere's the modified code:\n\n```python\n# Initialize an empty dictionary to store counts of each value\nvalue_counts = {}\n\n# Iterate through the dataset to count occurrences of each value\nfor data in dataset:\n    if data in value_counts:\n        value_counts[data] += 1\n    else:\n        value_counts[data] = 1\n\n# Iterate through the dictionary to find values with count of 1\nfor data, count in value_counts.items():\n    if count == 1:\n        print(data)\n```\n\nThis code efficiently counts the occurrences of each value in the dataset and then identifies and prints the unique values that appear only once."
