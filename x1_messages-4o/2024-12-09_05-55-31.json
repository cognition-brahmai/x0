Right now, the only way I know how to bundle it is by first compiling them with CMake before I can run `setup.py bdist_wheel`. Is there a way to invoke CMake as part of the `setup.py ext_modules` build process? I suspect it might involve creating a subclass of a certain class, but I'm not sure where to begin. I'm using CMake because it gives me more control for building C and C++ library extensions with complex build steps exactly as I want it. Additionally, I can easily build Python extensions directly with CMake using the `PYTHON_ADD_MODULE()` command in the `findPythonLibs.cmake`. Ideally, I would like to streamline this process into a single step."

        "content": "To integrate CMake with the `setup.py` process and streamline the building of a Python extension that links a C++ library, you can indeed subclass `setuptools` to invoke CMake as part of the `ext_modules` build process. Here is a general approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Create a CMake Extension Class**: You need to create a custom extension class that will handle the invocation of CMake during the build process.\n\n2. **Subclass the Build Extension Command**: Subclass the `build_ext` command from `setuptools` to run CMake during the build process.\n\nHere's a simplified example to demonstrate how you can do this:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\nfrom setuptools import setup, Extension\nfrom setuptools.command.build_ext import build_ext\n\nclass CMakeExtension(Extension):\n    def __init__(self, name, sourcedir=''):\n        Extension.__init__(self, name, sources=[])\n        self.sourcedir = os.path.abspath(sourcedir)\n\nclass CMakeBuild(build_ext):\n    def run(self):\n        for ext in self.extensions:\n            self.build_cmake(ext)\n        super().run()\n\n    def build_cmake(self, ext):\n        extdir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(self.get_ext_fullpath(ext.name)))\n        cmake_args = [\n            '-DCMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY=' + extdir,\n            '-DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=' + sys.executable\n        ]\n\n        build_args = ['--config', 'Release']\n\n        if not os.path.exists(self.build_temp):\n            os.makedirs(self.build_temp)\n\n        subprocess.check_call(['cmake', ext.sourcedir] + cmake_args, cwd=self.build_temp)\n        subprocess.check_call(['cmake', '--build', '.'] + build_args, cwd=self.build_temp)\n\nsetup(\n    name='your_package_name',\n    version='0.1',\n    author='Your Name',\n    author_email='your.email@example.com',\n    description='A description of your package',\n    long_description='',\n    ext_modules=[CMakeExtension('your_module_name', sourcedir='path/to/your/cpp/source')],\n    cmdclass=dict(build_ext=CMakeBuild),\n    zip_safe=False,\n)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **CMakeExtension**: This subclass of `Extension` is used to represent the CMake-based extension module. It does not take any sources because CMake handles the source files.\n\n- **CMakeBuild**: This subclass of `build_ext` is where the CMake build process is executed. It creates a build directory, configures the CMake build system, and then builds it.\n\n- **CMake Arguments**: The `cmake_args` list specifies arguments to pass to the CMake command, such as the output directory for the built library and the Python executable to use.\n\n- **Build Directory**: `self.build_temp` is used as the temporary directory where CMake will perform the build. Ensure this directory exists before invoking CMake.\n\n- **Integration**: The `setup()` function integrates this process by specifying the custom `CMakeExtension` and `CMakeBuild` classes.\n\nThis setup allows you to effectively invoke CMake as part of your Python package build process, enabling a streamlined workflow with `setup.py`."
