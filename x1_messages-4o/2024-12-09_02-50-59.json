        "content": "To select specific columns from a Pandas DataFrame and create a new DataFrame, you can use either of the following methods:\n\n1. **Using Double Brackets `[[ ]]`**: This is the most straightforward method.\n\n   ```python\n   df1 = df[['a', 'b']]\n   ```\n\n2. **Using `.loc`**: This method is useful if you're selecting both rows and columns, but here you can use it just for columns.\n\n   ```python\n   df1 = df.loc[:, ['a', 'b']]\n   ```\n\nThe issue with the methods you tried is that they don't correctly specify the columns. In your first attempt, `'a':'b'` is interpreted as slicing over the index, not the column labels. The second method with `.ix` was deprecated and removed in later versions of Pandas, in favor of using `.loc` and `.iloc`.\n\nUsing either of the methods shown above will correctly create a new DataFrame `df1` with only the columns 'a' and 'b' from your original DataFrame `df`."
