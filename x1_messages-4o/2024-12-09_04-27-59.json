It seems to duplicate everything executed in the main script, including prints and other logic. This is causing issues with my training logic, which I want to handle myself. For instance, I want to perform certain operations only once after calling `Trainer.fit()`. However, with the main script duplication, this is not working as planned. I've tried wrapping the code in `if __name__ == \"__main__\"`, but it didn't change the behavior. How can I solve this issue? How can I incorporate my logic around the Trainer object without the script being duplicated?"

        "content": "When using PyTorch Lightning with distributed data parallel (DDP) mode, it is common to encounter issues with script duplication, as each process spawned by DDP will execute the entire script. This is because DDP involves multiple processes, each responsible for handling its own subset of data, and by default, PyTorch Lightning will spawn a process for each GPU.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can address the issue and ensure that certain parts of your code are executed only once:\n\n1. **Use `if __name__ == \"__main__\"`:** You\u2019ve already tried this, which is the correct first step. Ensure that all your script logic outside of the training loop is wrapped in this block. This prevents unintended code execution during the multiprocessing fork. However, this alone may not solve your specific issue if you need to control execution within the training loop.\n\n2. **Use Callbacks for Post-Training Operations:** If you need to perform operations after training, consider using PyTorch Lightning callbacks. You can define a callback to execute logic after training ends. This ensures that code is executed only once at the end of the training across all processes:\n\n   ```python\n   from pytorch_lightning.callbacks import Callback\n\n   class PostTrainingCallback(Callback):\n       def on_train_end(self, trainer, pl_module):\n           if trainer.is_global_zero:  # Ensure this only runs on the main process\n               # Your logic here\n               print(\"Training completed. Running post-training logic.\")\n\n   # Include this callback when creating the trainer\n   trainer = pl.Trainer(callbacks=[PostTrainingCallback()])\n   ```\n\n3. **Check for Process Rank:** To ensure that certain code runs only on the main process, check the rank of the process. In PyTorch Lightning, you can use `trainer.is_global_zero` to check if the current process is the main process:\n\n   ```python\n   if trainer.is_global_zero:\n       # This code will only execute on the main process\n       print(\"Executing on the main process only.\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Separate Script Logic:** Consider separating the core logic of your script (e.g., data preparation, model definition) from the script that initializes the distributed training. This can be done by creating functions or separate modules to encapsulate different parts of the logic.\n\n5. **Use Environment Variables:** Sometimes, leveraging environment variables can help manage the execution flow, ensuring certain blocks of code are executed only by the main process.\n\n6. **Configuration:** Double-check your PyTorch Lightning configuration to ensure that `accelerator='ddp'` is correctly set up and that other settings align with your cluster environment.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you should be able to better control the execution flow of your script and ensure that specific logic is executed only once, as intended."
