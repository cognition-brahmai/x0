I am trying to return a large file (11MB) to the user, but instead of reading it from disk multiple times, I want to save it in memcached. However, when I try to retrieve the file from memcached, I always get None. Is there a size limit to what can be saved? Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\ndef download_demo():\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the demo file\n    \"\"\"\n    KEY = \"xyz\"\n    TIME = 86400 #24 hours\n\n    buff = memc.get(KEY)\n    if not buff: \n        file = open(FILENAME, 'r')\n        buff = file.read()\n        memc.set(KEY, buff, TIME)\n\n    print \"Content-Type:application/x-download\\nContent-Disposition:attachment;filename=%s\\nContent-Length:%s\\n\\n%s\" % (os.path.split(FILENAME)[-1], len(buff), buff)\n```"

        "content": "Memcached has a default maximum object size limit of 1MB. This limitation is likely why you're encountering issues when trying to store and retrieve a large file, such as your 11MB file. When you attempt to store objects larger than the maximum allowed size, memcached will fail to store the object, and you'll retrieve `None` when you try to access it.\n\nHere are a few strategies to handle larger files with memcached:\n\n1. **Increase the Maximum Object Size:**\n\n   You can increase the maximum object size limit by configuring the `-I` option when starting the memcached server. For example, to increase the limit to 20MB, you can start memcached with:\n   \n   ```bash\n   memcached -I 20m\n   ```\n\n   Note that increasing the object size may not be ideal for all scenarios, as it can lead to inefficient memory usage.\n\n2. **Chunking the Data:**\n\n   Split the file into smaller chunks, each within the size limit, and store them separately in memcached. You can then reconstruct the file by retrieving and concatenating these chunks. Here's a basic example of how you might implement this:\n\n   ```python\n   CHUNK_SIZE = 1024 * 1024  # 1MB\n\n   def chunk_data(data, chunk_size):\n       return [data[i:i + chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(data), chunk_size)]\n\n   def save_large_file_to_cache(key, data, expiration):\n       chunks = chunk_data(data, CHUNK_SIZE)\n       for index, chunk in enumerate(chunks):\n           memc.set(f\"{key}_{index}\", chunk, expiration)\n       memc.set(f\"{key}_count\", len(chunks), expiration)\n\n   def retrieve_large_file_from_cache(key):\n       chunk_count = memc.get(f\"{key}_count\")\n       if chunk_count is None:\n           return None\n       return ''.join(memc.get(f\"{key}_{i}\") or '' for i in range(chunk_count))\n\n   # Usage\n   if not buff:\n       file = open(FILENAME, 'r')\n       buff = file.read()\n       save_large_file_to_cache(KEY, buff, TIME)\n   else:\n       buff = retrieve_large_file_from_cache(KEY)\n   ```\n\n3. **Alternative Storage Solutions:**\n\n   If memcached isn't suitable for storing large files, consider using other storage solutions like Redis (with configured max memory and eviction policies), a distributed file system, or cloud storage services (e.g., AWS S3) that are designed to handle large files efficiently.\n\nBy considering these strategies, you can better handle large files in your application while still utilizing caching effectively."
