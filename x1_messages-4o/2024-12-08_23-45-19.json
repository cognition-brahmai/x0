Here's a simple Python program that uses the insertion sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers from smallest to largest:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    # Traverse from 1 to len(arr)\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        # Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are greater than key,\n        # to one position ahead of their current position\n        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [4, 2, 5, 1, 6]\ninsertion_sort(numbers)\nprint(\"Sorted list:\", numbers)\n```\n\nWhen you run this program, it will sort the list `[4, 2, 5, 1, 6]` into `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6]` using the insertion sort algorithm."
