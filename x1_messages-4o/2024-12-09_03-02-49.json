The `reindex()` method is used for aligning the DataFrame to a new index, but it doesn't reset the index numbers.\n\nHere's how you can reset the index:\n\n```python\ndf = df.reset_index(drop=True)\n```\n\nBy using `reset_index(drop=True)`, you ensure that the old index is dropped and not added as a new column to the DataFrame. This will give you the sequential index `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` for your DataFrame."
