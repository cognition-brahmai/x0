        "content": "Renaming a file during download directly using Selenium and the browser's built-in functionality isn't straightforward, as Selenium primarily interacts with the browser and doesn't have direct control over the file system or the download process. However, you can achieve this by renaming the file after it has been downloaded. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Wait for the download to complete.**\n2. **Rename the downloaded file using Python's file handling capabilities.**\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify your script to rename the downloaded file:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport time\nfrom selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.firefox.firefox_profile import FirefoxProfile\n\n# Set up Firefox profile\nprofile = FirefoxProfile()\nprofile.set_preference(\"browser.helperApps.neverAsk.saveToDisk\", \"text/plain, application/vnd.ms-excel, text/csv, text/comma-separated-values, application/octet-stream\")\ndownload_dir = \"C:\\\\Downloads\"\nprofile.set_preference(\"browser.download.dir\", download_dir)\nprofile.set_preference(\"browser.download.folderList\", 2)\nprofile.set_preference(\"browser.download.manager.showWhenStarting\", False)\n\n# Initialize the browser\nbrowser = webdriver.Firefox(firefox_profile=profile)\n\n# Download the file\nbrowser.get('https://test.com/')\nbrowser.find_element_by_partial_link_text(\"Excel\").click()\n\n# Wait for the download to complete (you might need to adjust timing)\ntime.sleep(10)\n\n# Rename the file\noriginal_file_name = os.path.join(download_dir, 'original_file_name.xlsx')  # Replace with the actual default name\nnew_file_name = os.path.join(download_dir, 'new_file_name.xlsx')\n\n# Ensure the file was downloaded\nif os.path.exists(original_file_name):\n    os.rename(original_file_name, new_file_name)\n    print(f\"File renamed to: {new_file_name}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Download failed or file not found.\")\n\n# Close the browser\nbrowser.quit()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Waiting for Download:** You'll need to ensure the file has been completely downloaded before attempting to rename it. This example uses `time.sleep(10)`, but you might need a more robust method to check for download completion, such as checking for the existence of the file.\n\n- **Original File Name:** You need to know the default name the file is saved as in your downloads folder, which can vary depending on how the server sends the file.\n\n- **Error Handling:** Consider adding error handling to manage situations where the file isn't downloaded as expected.\n\n- **Browser Configuration:** Ensure your browser profile settings are correctly configured to download files automatically to the specified directory.\n\nThis solution assumes that the downloaded file will have a predictable default name and that you know this name in advance. If the name isn't predictable, you'll need a different approach to identify the downloaded file."
