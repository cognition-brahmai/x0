This will open the Integrated Development and Learning Environment (IDLE) which includes a Python Shell.\n\n2. **Run the File in the Shell:**\n   - Once the Python Shell is open, you can run your script by using the `exec` function, provided your script is in the same directory where you start the Python Shell, or you can provide the full path to your script.\n   \n   Here's how you can do it:\n   \n   ```python\n   exec(open(\"C:/path/to/your/test.py\").read())\n   ```\n   \n   Replace `\"C:/path/to/your/test.py\"` with the actual path to your `test.py` file.\n\n3. **Alternative Method - Using IDLE:**\n   - Alternatively, you can directly open your `test.py` file in IDLE and run it from there:\n     - Open IDLE.\n     - Go to `File > Open...` and select your `test.py` file.\n     - Your script will open in a new window. From there, you can run the script by pressing `F5` or selecting `Run > Run Module` from the menu.\n\nBy using these methods, you should be able to run your `test.py` file in the Python Shell."
