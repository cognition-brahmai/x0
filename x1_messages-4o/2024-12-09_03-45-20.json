        "content": "I recently upgraded from Django 1.10.4 to 1.11.1 and I am now getting a large number of UnorderedObjectListWarning messages when I run my tests. The warning seems to be related to my queryset code and appears to suggest I need to add a `order_by(id)` at the end of every filter. However, I am unable to identify the specific code that requires the `order_by` to be added, as the warning does not return a stack trace and seems to occur randomly during my test run. How can I find more detailed information regarding this warning?\n\nAdditionally, I have a test causing this error: `response = self.client.get('/api/orders/')`. This goes to `OrderViewSet` but none of the things in get_queryset cause it and nothing in serializer class causes it. I have other tests that use the same code to get /api/orders and those don't cause it. What does DRF do after get_queryset?"

        "content": "The `UnorderedObjectListWarning` in Django typically occurs when you are performing operations that require a deterministic order on a queryset, such as slicing or using `distinct()`, without specifying an explicit order. Django 1.11 introduced stricter checks for unordered querysets to ensure predictable results.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to identify and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Identify Querysets with Slicing or Distinct**: Review your code for any querysets where you are using slicing (`[:n]`) or calling `distinct()`. Ensure these querysets have an `order_by()` clause.\n\n2. **Enable Debugging Logs**: You can enable more verbose logging for your queries, which might help you identify the problematic query. Add the following to your `settings.py`:\n   ```python\n   LOGGING = {\n       'version': 1,\n       'handlers': {\n           'console': {\n               'level': 'DEBUG',\n               'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',\n           },\n       },\n       'loggers': {\n           'django.db.backends': {\n               'handlers': ['console'],\n               'level': 'DEBUG',\n           },\n       },\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Trace the Test Case**: Since you mentioned the warning appears in a specific test, try to temporarily add logging or print statements in your code to narrow down the location. Focus on the viewset and any related queryset logic.\n\n4. **Review the ViewSet and Serializer**: Although you mentioned that nothing in `get_queryset` or the serializer causes it, double-check any custom methods or properties in these classes that might access the queryset in a way that requires ordering.\n\n5. **Check DRF Behaviors**: After `get_queryset`, DRF typically performs filtering, pagination, and sorting. Check your `OrderViewSet` for any custom filtering or pagination settings that might require an ordered queryset.\n\n6. **Look for Middleware or Signals**: If you have any middleware or signals that manipulate querysets, ensure these are not causing the warning.\n\n7. **Test in Isolation**: Create a minimal version of your test case to see if you can replicate the issue with the simplest possible setup. This can help isolate the cause.\n\n8. **Use `order_by` as a Temporary Fix**: As a temporary measure, you can add `order_by('id')` in places where you suspect the warning may occur to see if it resolves the issue, and then narrow down from there.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to narrow down the source of the `UnorderedObjectListWarning` and apply the necessary fix."
