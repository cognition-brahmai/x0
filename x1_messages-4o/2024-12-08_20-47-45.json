The table should include at least five elements such as themes, style, subject matter, literary devices, and notable poets. Please provide a brief explanation of each element and how it differs between the two literary movements. Additionally, can you show me how to include at least one example of a poem from each movement to support the analysis using Swift code?"

        "content": "To generate a LaTeX table in Swift that compares and contrasts \"Romantic Poetry\" and \"Victorian Poetry,\" you can use Swift's string manipulation capabilities to construct the LaTeX code. Below, I'll provide you with both the LaTeX table structure and a Swift code snippet to generate it.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Elements\n\n1. **Themes**: \n   - *Romantic Poetry*: Emphasizes emotion, nature, and individualism. It often explores the sublime and the beauty of the natural world.\n   - *Victorian Poetry*: Focuses on social issues, realism, and moralistic themes. It reflects the complexities of the industrial age and often includes a sense of doubt or questioning.\n\n2. **Style**: \n   - *Romantic Poetry*: Highly expressive and imaginative, often with a focus on personal experience and introspection.\n   - *Victorian Poetry*: More structured and didactic, with a tendency towards narrative and detailed description.\n\n3. **Subject Matter**: \n   - *Romantic Poetry*: Nature, the supernatural, and the inner world of the poet.\n   - *Victorian Poetry*: Society, industrialization, and the struggles of the common people.\n\n4. **Literary Devices**: \n   - *Romantic Poetry*: Symbolism, imagery, and personification.\n   - *Victorian Poetry*: Irony, dramatic monologue, and allegory.\n\n5. **Notable Poets**: \n   - *Romantic Poetry*: William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron.\n   - *Victorian Poetry*: Alfred Lord Tennyson, Robert Browning, Elizabeth Barrett Browning.\n\n### Step 2: LaTeX Table Structure\n\nHere's a LaTeX table that includes these elements:\n\n```latex\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Element} & \\textbf{Romantic Poetry} & \\textbf{Victorian Poetry} \\\\ \\hline\nThemes & Emotion, nature, individualism & Social issues, realism, moralism \\\\ \\hline\nStyle & Expressive, imaginative & Structured, didactic \\\\ \\hline\nSubject Matter & Nature, supernatural, inner world & Society, industrialization, struggles \\\\ \\hline\nLiterary Devices & Symbolism, imagery, personification & Irony, dramatic monologue, allegory \\\\ \\hline\nNotable Poets & Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron & Tennyson, Browning, Barrett Browning \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Comparison of Romantic and Victorian Poetry}\n\\end{table}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Swift Code to Generate LaTeX Table\n\nHere's a Swift code snippet to generate the above LaTeX table:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nfunc generateLaTeXTable() -> String {\n    let elements = [\n        (\"Themes\", \"Emotion, nature, individualism\", \"Social issues, realism, moralism\"),\n        (\"Style\", \"Expressive, imaginative\", \"Structured, didactic\"),\n        (\"Subject Matter\", \"Nature, supernatural, inner world\", \"Society, industrialization, struggles\"),\n        (\"Literary Devices\", \"Symbolism, imagery, personification\", \"Irony, dramatic monologue, allegory\"),\n        (\"Notable Poets\", \"Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron\", \"Tennyson, Browning, Barrett Browning\")\n    ]\n\n    var table = \"\\\\begin{table}[h]\\n\\\\centering\\n\\\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}\\n\\\\hline\\n\"\n    table += \"\\\\textbf{Element} & \\\\textbf{Romantic Poetry} & \\\\textbf{Victorian Poetry} \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline\\n\"\n    \n    for (element, romantic, victorian) in elements {\n        table += \"\\(element) & \\(romantic) & \\(victorian) \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline\\n\"\n    }\n    \n    table += \"\\\\end{tabular}\\n\\\\caption{Comparison of Romantic and Victorian Poetry}\\n\\\\end{table}\"\n    return table\n}\n\nlet latexTable = generateLaTeXTable()\nprint(latexTable)\n```\n\n### Step 4: Include Example Poems\n\nTo include example poems in the analysis, you can add a section to the LaTeX document for each poem. Here's how you might structure that in LaTeX:\n\n```latex\n\\section*{Example Poems}\n\n\\subsection*{Romantic Poetry}\n\\textbf{Example:} \"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud\" by William Wordsworth\n\\begin{quote}\nI wandered lonely as a cloud \\\\\nThat floats on high o'er vales and hills, \\\\\nWhen all at once I saw a crowd, \\\\\nA host, of golden daffodils; \\\\\nBeside the lake, beneath the trees, \\\\\nFluttering and dancing in the breeze.\n\\end{quote}\n\n\\subsection*{Victorian Poetry}\n\\textbf{Example:} \"The Lady of Shalott\" by Alfred Lord Tennyson\n\\begin{quote}\nOn either side the river lie \\\\\nLong fields of barley and of rye, \\\\\nThat clothe the wold and meet the sky; \\\\\nAnd through the field the road runs by \\\\\nTo many-tower'd Camelot; \\\\\nAnd up and down the people go, \\\\\nGazing where the lilies blow \\\\\nRound an island there below, \\\\\nThe island of Shalott.\n\\end{quote}\n```\n\nYou can include these poem sections in your LaTeX document by appending them to the generated table code within your Swift program, ensuring a comprehensive analysis."
