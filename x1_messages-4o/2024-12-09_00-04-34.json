Use the extracted data to construct your sentence.\n\nHere's an example sentence using Pittsburgh:\n\n\"Pittsburgh, with a population of 302,407, is a vibrant city known for its rich history and cultural diversity.\"\n\nThis approach allows you to create a sentence focused on a single city without explicitly listing all the cities in your JSON data."
