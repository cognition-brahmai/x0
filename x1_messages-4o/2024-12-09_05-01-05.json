The length of the lists is always equal and I wish to report the cosine similarity as a number between 0 and 1. I have a function defined as follows:\n\n```python\ndataSetI = [3, 45, 7, 2]\ndataSetII = [2, 54, 13, 15]\n\ndef cosine_similarity(list1, list2):\n  # How to?\n  pass\n\nprint(cosine_similarity(dataSetI, dataSetII))\n```\nbut I am unsure of how to implement the cosine similarity calculation within this function."

        "content": "To calculate the cosine similarity between two lists in Python, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute the dot product of the two lists.\n2. Compute the magnitude (Euclidean norm) of each list.\n3. Divide the dot product by the product of the magnitudes of the two lists.\n\nHere is how you can implement it in your function:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef cosine_similarity(list1, list2):\n    # Step 1: Calculate the dot product of the two lists\n    dot_product = sum(a * b for a, b in zip(list1, list2))\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate the magnitude (Euclidean norm) of each list\n    magnitude_list1 = math.sqrt(sum(a * a for a in list1))\n    magnitude_list2 = math.sqrt(sum(b * b for b in list2))\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the cosine similarity\n    if magnitude_list1 == 0 or magnitude_list2 == 0:\n        # To handle the situation where one of the vectors is zero\n        return 0.0\n    \n    cosine_sim = dot_product / (magnitude_list1 * magnitude_list2)\n    \n    return cosine_sim\n\ndataSetI = [3, 45, 7, 2]\ndataSetII = [2, 54, 13, 15]\n\nprint(cosine_similarity(dataSetI, dataSetII))\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will calculate and print the cosine similarity between `dataSetI` and `dataSetII`. The result will be a number between -1 and 1, where 1 indicates perfect similarity, 0 indicates no similarity, and -1 indicates perfect dissimilarity. However, since both input lists contain only non-negative numbers, the cosine similarity will range between 0 and 1."
