According to the Python documentation, two aspects are guaranteed not to change: the addition of a new seeding method will offer a backward compatible seeder, and the generator\u2019s random() method will continue to produce the same sequence when the compatible seeder is given the same seed. However, when I run the following code on two different machines with different Python3 versions, I get different results:\n\n```\nimport sys\nprint(sys.version)\n\nfrom random import seed, random\n\nseed(str(1))\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(random())\n```\n\nOn one machine, I get:\n\n```\n3.2.3 (default, May  3 2012, 15:51:42) \n[GCC 4.6.3]\n0.4782479962566343\n0.044242767098090496\n0.11703586901195051\n0.8566892547933538\n0.2926790185279551\n0.0067328440779825804\n0.0013279506360178717\n0.22167546902173108\n0.9864945747444945\n0.5157002525757287\n```\n\nOn the other, I get:\n\n```\n3.1.2 (release31-maint, Dec  9 2011, 20:59:40)  \n[GCC 4.4.5]\n0.0698436845523\n0.27772471476\n0.833036057868\n0.35569897036\n0.36366158783\n0.722487971761\n0.963133581734\n0.263723867191\n0.451002768569\n0.0998765577881\n```\n\nWhy is this? And is there any way to ensure that I get the same random sequence on both machines?"

        "content": "The discrepancy you're observing arises from differences in the implementation of Python's `random` module across different Python versions. Specifically, the way seeds are processed and how the random number generator (RNG) is initialized can differ. \n\nIn your case, you're passing a string representation of an integer (`str(1)`) to the `seed()` function. Prior to Python 3.2, `random.seed()` behavior with strings was different due to how the strings were hashed and used to initialize the RNG. Starting with Python 3.2, there were changes to make the seeding more consistent and secure.\n\nTo achieve consistent results across different Python versions, you should:\n\n1. Use an integer seed instead of a string. This is because the integer seeding mechanism is more consistent across versions.\n\n2. Ensure you're using the same major version of Python on both systems if possible. This will help ensure that any implementation details that might affect random number generation are consistent.\n\nHere's a modified version of your code using an integer seed:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nprint(sys.version)\n\nfrom random import seed, random\n\nseed(1)  # Use an integer seed\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(random())\n```\n\nWith this change, you should see consistent results across different Python environments, provided they are using the same random number generation algorithm. However, if you are using significantly different Python versions, there might still be variations due to changes in the random module's implementation. In such cases, relying on the same Python version across environments is crucial."
