        "content": "I am using CNN for image classification on an unbalanced dataset. It's a multiclass problem (not multilabel) and I have 16 classes. The classes are one hot encoded. I am trying to compute MACRO metrics for each epoch: F1, precision, and recall. I found a code that allows these metrics to be printed, but it works only on the validation set. I am unsure if this code is functioning correctly because we use \"val_predict = (np.asarray(self.model.predict(self.validation_data[0]))).round()\". Could the ROUND function lead to errors in the case of multiclass classification? I've also used code to print the metrics (only recall since it's important for me) on the training set. However, the validation macro recall is different between the two codes. Why do I have different values on my macro validation recall with the two different codes? \n\nBonus question: For those who have tried this before, is it really worth using a custom loss based on our interested metric (for example, recall) or does categorical cross entropy with weights produce the same result?"

        "content": "When dealing with a multiclass classification problem, using the `round()` function on your predictions can indeed cause issues. The `round()` function is typically used in binary classification to convert probabilities to binary outcomes. However, in a multiclass setting, the output layer of your CNN likely uses a softmax activation function, which outputs probabilities that should sum to 1 across all classes for each instance. In this case, using `round()` could result in incorrect class assignments because it doesn't account for the relative probabilities of all the classes. Instead, you should use `argmax()` to select the class with the highest predicted probability for each instance:\n\n```python\nval_predict = np.argmax(self.model.predict(self.validation_data[0]), axis=1)\nval_true = np.argmax(self.validation_data[1], axis=1)\n```\n\nThis approach will ensure that the class with the highest probability is selected, which is the correct way to handle predictions in a multiclass setting.\n\nRegarding the different values of macro validation recall you are observing, there could be a few reasons for this discrepancy:\n\n1. **Data Splits**: Ensure that the validation data used in both codes is exactly the same. Any variation in the data could lead to different metric values.\n\n2. **Normalization and Preprocessing**: Check if both codes apply the same preprocessing steps to the validation data before making predictions.\n\n3. **Metric Calculation**: Verify that both codes are calculating the macro recall in the same manner. Macro recall is the average recall across all classes and can be computed differently if there is a mismatch in how each class's recall is calculated.\n\n4. **Epochs and Model States**: Ensure that the model's state is the same when evaluating the validation set in both methods. Differences in training epochs or model saving/loading could affect the results.\n\nFor your bonus question regarding using a custom loss function:\n\n- **Custom Loss Function**: If recall is particularly important for your application, designing a custom loss function that directly optimizes for recall can be beneficial. This approach can help the model focus more on the classes that are underrepresented or more critical in the context of your problem.\n\n- **Categorical Cross-Entropy with Class Weights**: This is a simpler approach where you adjust the loss to account for class imbalances by assigning higher weights to less frequent classes. It can be effective in improving the model's performance on underrepresented classes without needing to redesign the loss function entirely.\n\nUltimately, the decision depends on your specific use case and constraints. If recall is crucial, experimenting with a custom loss function tailored to maximize recall might be worthwhile. However, starting with class weights and monitoring performance could be a practical first step, as it might provide sufficient improvements without complicating the training process."
