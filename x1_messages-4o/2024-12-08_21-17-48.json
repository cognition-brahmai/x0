        "content": "Certainly! The distributive law states that \\( a(b + c) = ab + ac \\). We can apply this law in reverse to factor out a common factor from terms in an equation.\n\nGiven the equation:\n\n\\[ 2x + 4y + 5z = 7 \\]\n\nWe can look for a common factor in some of the terms. Notice that \\(2x\\) and \\(4y\\) have a common factor of 2. We can factor out the 2 from these terms:\n\n\\[ 2(x + 2y) + 5z = 7 \\]\n\nIn LaTeX, this can be represented as:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\begin{document}\n\nGiven the equation:\n\\[\n2x + 4y + 5z = 7\n\\]\n\nWe can factor out the common factor from the first two terms:\n\\[\n2(x + 2y) + 5z = 7\n\\]\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nThis demonstrates how to apply the distributive law to group terms with a common factor and rewrite the equation in an equivalent form."
