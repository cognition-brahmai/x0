According to the AWS documentation, the following code should work:\n\n```python\nimport logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger()\nlogger.setLevel(logging.INFO)\n\ndef my_logging_handler(event, context):\n    logger.info('got event{}'.format(event))\n    logger.error('something went wrong')\n```\n\nHowever, when I use the following code:\n\n```python\nimport logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level = logging.INFO)\nlogging.info(\"Hello World!\")\n```\n\nI notice that the first code snippet prints in the Cloud Watch console, but the second one does not. Even though both snippets are using the root logger, why is there a difference in their output?"

        "content": "When you're working with AWS Lambda, it's essential to understand how the logging system is set up and how it interacts with AWS CloudWatch.\n\n1. **AWS Lambda Logging Behavior**:\n   - AWS Lambda automatically configures a default logging handler that sends logs to AWS CloudWatch.\n   - When you use `logging.getLogger()` in the first snippet, it retrieves the root logger which is already configured by AWS Lambda to output logs to CloudWatch.\n   - Setting the log level with `logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)` ensures that any logs at the INFO level or higher are captured and sent to CloudWatch.\n\n2. **Difference in `logging.basicConfig`**:\n   - The `logging.basicConfig()` function is used to configure the logging system. However, if the root logger already has handlers configured (as it is in AWS Lambda), calling `basicConfig()` will have no effect because `basicConfig()` can only configure the logging system once and only if no logging configuration has been done yet.\n   - In AWS Lambda's environment, by the time your Lambda function code runs, AWS has already configured the logging handlers (specifically for sending logs to CloudWatch) which is why calls to `basicConfig()` don't change the logging setup.\n\n3. **Why the Second Snippet Doesn\u2019t Log**:\n   - Since `basicConfig()` is ineffective in altering the existing configuration in a Lambda environment, calling `logging.info(\"Hello World!\")` doesn't utilize the Lambda-configured handler to send logs to CloudWatch.\n\nTo ensure your logs are captured and sent to CloudWatch in a Lambda environment, you should stick with the method shown in the first snippet\u2014using `getLogger()` to access the pre-configured root logger and setting the desired logging level. This approach takes advantage of the existing configuration set up by AWS Lambda for logging."
