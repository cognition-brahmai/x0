If there is no match, the result will contain NULLs for columns from the \"orders\" table. Here is your query with the `LEFT JOIN`:\n\n```sql\nSELECT c.name\nFROM customers c\nLEFT JOIN orders o\nON c.id = o.customer_id;\n```\n\nThis modification ensures that all customers are included in the result, even if they haven't placed any orders. If you want to include additional columns from the \"orders\" table, just add them to the `SELECT` clause. Let me know if you need further optimization or have other questions!"
