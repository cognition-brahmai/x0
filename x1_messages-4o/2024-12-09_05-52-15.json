Here are my example lists:\n\n```python\nfirst = [1, 5, 8]\nsecond = [0.5, 4]\n```\n\nThe output I am looking for is a combined list of tuples, where each tuple represents a unique combination of elements from the two lists:\n\n```python\ncombined = [(1, 0.5), (1, 4), (5, 0.5), (5, 4), (8, 0.5), (8, 4)]\n```\n\nHow can I achieve this in Python?"

        "content": "To achieve this, you can use the `itertools.product` function from the `itertools` module in Python. This function computes the Cartesian product of input iterables, which is exactly what you need for combining elements from your lists. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\nfirst = [1, 5, 8]\nsecond = [0.5, 4]\n\ncombined = list(product(first, second))\n\nprint(combined)\n```\n\nThe `product` function will generate all possible combinations of elements from the provided lists, and converting it to a list will give you your desired output:\n\n```\n[(1, 0.5), (1, 4), (5, 0.5), (5, 4), (8, 0.5), (8, 4)]\n```\n\nThis method is efficient and works well for lists of varying lengths."
