The connection must use a form of encryption that has a probability of being guessed of only 1 in 2^256. Your options are limited to two programming languages: \"Pascal\" and \"Python\". One of these languages has a built-in library that can generate this type of encryption, while the other language does not. Which programming language should you choose to ensure the highest level of security for your connection?"

        "content": "To create a secure connection between two devices over the internet with encryption that has a probability of being guessed of only 1 in 2^256, you should choose Python. Python has a robust set of libraries for cryptography, including the `cryptography` library which supports modern encryption algorithms such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with 256-bit keys. This aligns with your requirement for strong encryption with a very low probability of being guessed.\n\nPascal, on the other hand, does not have as extensive support for modern cryptographic algorithms in its standard libraries compared to Python. Therefore, Python is the better choice for implementing secure encryption in this scenario."
