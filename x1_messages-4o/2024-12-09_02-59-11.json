I am looking for a way to get notified of a user login/logout and to query user login status. The ideal solution would be a signal sent by each `django.contrib.auth.views.login` and `... views.logout`, and a method `django.contrib.auth.models.User.is_logged_in()`, similar to `... User.is_active()` or `... User.is_authenticated()`. However, Django 1.1.1 does not have these features and I am hesitant to modify the source code. As a temporary solution, I have added an `is_logged_in` boolean field to the UserProfile model which is cleared by default and set the first time the user accesses the landing page (defined by `LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/'`). However, this solution seems imperfect, particularly because clearing the flag for users who simply leave the page or close the browser is not straightforward. Also, I believe `is_logged_in` should belong in the User model, not the UserProfile model. Can anyone suggest alternate approaches?"

        "content": "To achieve the functionality you're looking for in Django 1.1.1, there are some workarounds you can implement to handle user login and logout events and manage their session states more effectively. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Custom Middleware**: You can create custom middleware to track user login and logout events. Middleware can be used to check the user's session and update the `is_logged_in` field accordingly.\n\n   ```python\n   from django.utils.deprecation import MiddlewareMixin\n   from django.contrib.auth.signals import user_logged_in, user_logged_out\n   from django.dispatch import receiver\n\n   class LoginLogoutMiddleware(MiddlewareMixin):\n       def process_request(self, request):\n           if request.user.is_authenticated:\n               request.user.profile.is_logged_in = True\n               request.user.profile.save()\n\n   @receiver(user_logged_out)\n   def on_user_logged_out(sender, request, user, **kwargs):\n       user.profile.is_logged_in = False\n       user.profile.save()\n   ```\n\n2. **Signals**: Although Django 1.1.1 doesn't include signals for login/logout by default, you can manually connect signals to the login and logout views to update your `UserProfile` model.\n\n   ```python\n   from django.contrib.auth.signals import user_logged_in, user_logged_out\n   from django.dispatch import receiver\n\n   @receiver(user_logged_in)\n   def on_user_logged_in(sender, request, user, **kwargs):\n       user.profile.is_logged_in = True\n       user.profile.save()\n\n   @receiver(user_logged_out)\n   def on_user_logged_out(sender, request, user, **kwargs):\n       user.profile.is_logged_in = False\n       user.profile.save()\n   ```\n\n3. **Session Management**: Leverage Django's session framework to manage user login states. You can set a session variable when the user logs in and clear it when they log out.\n\n   ```python\n   def login_user(request):\n       # Your login logic\n       request.session['is_logged_in'] = True\n\n   def logout_user(request):\n       # Your logout logic\n       if 'is_logged_in' in request.session:\n           del request.session['is_logged_in']\n   ```\n\n4. **Custom User Model**: If possible, consider extending the User model to include an `is_logged_in` field directly, though this might require more changes to your existing database schema.\n\n5. **Periodic Task Management**: Use a task queue like Celery to manage periodic background jobs. You can start and stop tasks based on login/logout events using signals or middleware.\n\nRemember, since Django 1.1.1 is quite old, consider upgrading to a newer version if possible, as it will provide more built-in features and better security support."
