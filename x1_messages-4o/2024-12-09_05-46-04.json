        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to how you're trying to call the `pop` method on the list `listb`. The `pop` method is a function and should be called with parentheses `()`, not square brackets `[]`. Square brackets are used for indexing or slicing, not for invoking functions.\n\nHere's the corrected version of your code snippet:\n\n```python\nelif listb[0] == \"-test\":\n    run_all.set(\"testview\")\n    listb.pop(0)  # Corrected line: use parentheses to call the pop method\n```\n\nIn this corrected line, `listb.pop(0)` is the proper way to call the `pop` method to remove the first element from `listb`. This should resolve the `TypeError` you were experiencing."
