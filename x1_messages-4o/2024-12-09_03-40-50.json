In particular, I am interested in the valid names for the pre-trained model, \"inception-v3\", available here: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/v0.6.0/tutorials/image_recognition/index.html. From the example given, \"pool_3\" appears to be a valid tensor, but I would like to have a list of all of them. I have referenced the paper, \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567\", where some of the layers seem to correspond with the sizes in Table 1, but not all of them."

        "content": "To obtain a list of all valid tensor names from a pre-trained model like Inception-v3 in TensorFlow, you can load the model graph and inspect it. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Load the Graph:**\n   First, you need to load the pre-trained model into a TensorFlow graph. You can typically obtain the model as a `.pb` file (frozen graph) from TensorFlow\u2019s model zoo or other sources.\n\n2. **Import the Graph:**\n   Use TensorFlow functions to import the graph from the `.pb` file.\n\n3. **List All Tensor Names:**\n   Once the graph is loaded, you can iterate over all the operations in the graph and extract the tensor names.\n\nHere\u2019s a sample script to do this:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Load the graph\ndef load_graph(model_file):\n    graph = tf.Graph()\n    graph_def = tf.compat.v1.GraphDef()\n\n    with tf.io.gfile.GFile(model_file, 'rb') as f:\n        graph_def.ParseFromString(f.read())\n\n    with graph.as_default():\n        tf.import_graph_def(graph_def, name='')\n\n    return graph\n\ndef list_tensor_names(graph):\n    tensor_names = [tensor.name for op in graph.get_operations() for tensor in op.outputs]\n    return tensor_names\n\n# Replace 'path_to_model.pb' with the path to your .pb file\ngraph = load_graph('path_to_model.pb')\ntensor_names = list_tensor_names(graph)\n\n# Print the tensor names\nfor name in tensor_names:\n    print(name)\n```\n\n### Notes:\n- **File Path:** Ensure you replace `'path_to_model.pb'` with the actual path to your Inception-v3 `.pb` file.\n- **TensorFlow Version:** The above code uses TensorFlow 2.x compatibility mode for loading the graph, which is compatible with TensorFlow 1.x models. Adjust the script if you are using an older TensorFlow version.\n- **Graph Names:** The tensor names typically include the operation names along with the index of the output tensor (e.g., `pool_3:0`).\n- **Exploring Weights:** If you are interested in layer weights or biases, you might need to inspect specific operations that hold these variables.\n\nThis approach will give you a comprehensive list of all tensor names in the Inception-v3 model, which you can use with `get_tensor_by_name(name)`."
