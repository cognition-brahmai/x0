My code is as follows:\n\n```python\nim = cv2.imread('./test_imgs/zzzyj.jpg')\ncv2.imshow('Image', cv2.blur(im, 2))\ncv2.waitKey(0)\n```\n\nThis code is almost directly copied from the official OpenCV documentation. However, it is not working and the only error message I am receiving is:\n\n```python\nSystemError: new style getargs format but argument is not a tuple\n```\n\nThe same error occurs with GaussianBlur, but not with medianBlur. Can you help me understand why this is happening and how to resolve it?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the way the `cv2.blur()` function is being called in your code. The function `cv2.blur()` expects a tuple for the second argument, which represents the size of the kernel. In your code, you provided an integer `2`, which causes the error since it's not in a tuple format.\n\nHere's how you can correct your code:\n\n```python\nim = cv2.imread('./test_imgs/zzzyj.jpg')\nif im is not None:\n    # Provide the kernel size as a tuple (e.g., (2, 2))\n    blurred_image = cv2.blur(im, (2, 2))\n    cv2.imshow('Image', blurred_image)\n    cv2.waitKey(0)\n    cv2.destroyAllWindows()\nelse:\n    print(\"Error: Image not found or unable to load.\")\n```\n\n**Key Changes:**\n1. **Kernel Size**: Changed `2` to `(2, 2)` in the `cv2.blur()` function call, which specifies a 2x2 kernel.\n2. **Image Check**: Added a check to ensure the image was loaded correctly. If the image path is incorrect or the image cannot be loaded, `cv2.imread()` returns `None`, which would lead to further errors if not handled.\n3. **Window Management**: Added `cv2.destroyAllWindows()` to close the window after displaying the image.\n\nThese changes should resolve the error you're facing and ensure that your image processing works as intended."
