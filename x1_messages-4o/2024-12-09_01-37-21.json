        "content": "For reading ELF file debug information in DWARF format within a Python program, you can consider using the `pyelftools` library. It's a pure Python library specifically designed for parsing ELF and DWARF files. Here are some key features and reasons why it might be a good fit for your needs:\n\n1. **Cross-Platform**: As a Python library, `pyelftools` is inherently cross-platform, compatible with any system that supports Python.\n\n2. **Comprehensive DWARF Support**: It provides robust support for reading and interpreting DWARF debugging information, which makes it suitable for your requirements.\n\n3. **Ease of Use**: Being a Python library, it integrates seamlessly into Python projects, allowing you to use it without needing to set up complex build environments.\n\n4. **Community and Documentation**: `pyelftools` is well-documented and has an active community, which can be helpful if you encounter issues or need examples.\n\nTo install `pyelftools`, you can use pip:\n\n```bash\npip install pyelftools\n```\n\nAnd here's a small example of how you might start using it:\n\n```python\nfrom elftools.elf.elffile import ELFFile\n\nwith open('your_file.elf', 'rb') as f:\n    elffile = ELFFile(f)\n    if elffile.has_dwarf_info():\n        dwarf_info = elffile.get_dwarf_info()\n        # You can now access various sections of the DWARF information\n```\n\nThis should provide you with a good starting point for working with ELF and DWARF data in your Python program."
