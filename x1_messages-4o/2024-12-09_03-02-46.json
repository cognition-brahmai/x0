I have been successful in splitting the PDF up into individual pages using existing tools, but am struggling to find any that can convert PDFs to images. I am unable to use PIL as it can't read PDFs. The other two options I found were GhostScript and ImageMagick via the shell, but these are not viable for me as the program needs to be cross-platform. I also cannot make sure these programs will be available on all the machines it will be installed and used on. Are there any Python libraries available that can achieve this?"

        "content": "Certainly! If you are looking to convert PDF pages into images using Python without relying on external tools like GhostScript or ImageMagick, you can consider using the `pdf2image` library, which is a popular choice for this task. It provides a straightforward way to convert PDF files into images using Python, and it is cross-platform. Here's how you can use it:\n\n1. **Install the `pdf2image` and `poppler-utils`:**\n\n   The `pdf2image` library depends on `poppler-utils` for rendering PDFs to images. You will need to have `poppler-utils` installed on the system. On Windows, you can download the binaries and add them to your PATH. On macOS, you can use Homebrew, and on Linux, it can be installed via the package manager.\n\n   For Windows: Download Poppler for Windows and add the bin folder to your system PATH.\n\n   For macOS: Use Homebrew to install Poppler:\n   ```sh\n   brew install poppler\n   ```\n\n   For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):\n   ```sh\n   sudo apt-get install poppler-utils\n   ```\n\n   Install `pdf2image` using pip:\n   ```sh\n   pip install pdf2image\n   ```\n\n2. **Convert PDF to Images:**\n\n   Here's a sample code to convert each page of a PDF to a JPEG image:\n\n   ```python\n   from pdf2image import convert_from_path\n\n   # Path to your PDF file\n   pdf_path = 'path/to/your/file.pdf'\n\n   # Convert PDF to images\n   images = convert_from_path(pdf_path)\n\n   # Save images as JPEG files\n   for i, image in enumerate(images):\n       image.save(f'page_{i+1}.jpg', 'JPEG')\n   ```\n\nThis approach should work across different platforms as long as `poppler-utils` is installed and available. `pdf2image` will handle the conversion of each PDF page into an image, which can then be saved in the desired format."
