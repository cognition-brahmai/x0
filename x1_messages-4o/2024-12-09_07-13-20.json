However, I'm finding that these snippets only utilize 30% - 50% of all available processors, and I'm unable to achieve full 100% usage. I'm running this on a Windows 7, 64bit OS. I also noticed that multiple python.exe processes are created and destroyed periodically. How do these processes relate to the processors? If I spawn 4 processes, are they each using their own core or are they sharing all cores? If they're sharing, is it the OS that is forcing this sharing? How can I 'force' Python to use all 100% of the processors?\n\nHere are the two code snippets I'm using:\n\nCode snippet 1:\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\n\ndef worker():\n    #worker function\n    print ('Worker')\n    x = 0\n    while x < 1000:\n        print(x)\n        x += 1\n    return\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    jobs = []\n    for i in range(50):\n        p = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker)\n        jobs.append(p)\n        p.start()\n```\nCode snippet 2:\n```python\nfrom multiprocessing import Process, Lock\n\ndef f(l, i):\n    l.acquire()\n    print('worker ', i)\n    x = 0\n    while x < 1000:\n        print(x)\n        x += 1\n    l.release()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__': \n    lock = Lock()\n    for num in range(50):\n        Process(target=f, args=(lock, num)).start()\n```"

        "content": "When you run multiprocessing code in Python, you're aiming to take advantage of multiple CPU cores to perform parallel processing. However, there are several factors that can affect how well your code utilizes the available CPU resources.\n\n### Understanding Multiprocessing and CPU Usage\n\n1. **Multiple Processes**: When you create multiple processes using the `multiprocessing` module, each process can potentially run on a different CPU core. However, the operating system's scheduler is responsible for allocating CPU time, and it may not distribute processes evenly across cores.\n\n2. **Process Scheduling**: The OS determines how processes are scheduled and can move them between cores. In some cases, it might not utilize all available cores efficiently, especially if the processes are not CPU-bound or if there is not enough work to keep all cores busy.\n\n3. **I/O Bound vs CPU Bound**: If your code is I/O bound (e.g., it reads from disk or waits for network operations), it might not fully utilize the CPU because it spends time waiting for I/O operations to complete. Your current code snippets have loops with `print()` statements, which can be I/O-bound due to console output.\n\n4. **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**: Though the GIL is primarily a concern in Python threads, not processes, it's worth noting that Python\u2019s multiprocessing sidesteps the GIL by using separate memory spaces for each process.\n\n### Analyzing and Improving CPU Usage\n\n1. **Worker Function**: In both snippets, the worker function involves a loop with a `print()`, which is I/O-bound. This could be limiting CPU usage. To test CPU-bound performance, replace `print()` with a CPU-intensive task, like a large mathematical computation.\n\n2. **Number of Processes**: Creating more processes than available cores can lead to overhead due to context switching. Try adjusting the number of processes to match the number of cores (use `multiprocessing.cpu_count()` to find the number of cores).\n\n3. **Lock Usage**: In the second snippet, using a lock around the `print()` statement serializes access to the console, which might reduce parallel efficiency. If the lock is unnecessary for your task, remove it to improve parallelism.\n\n4. **Monitoring CPU Usage**: Use a task manager or system monitor to observe CPU usage. Tools like `psutil` in Python can also help to programmatically check CPU usage.\n\n### Example of a CPU-Bound Task\n\nHere's how you might modify your worker function to perform a CPU-bound operation:\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\nimport math\n\ndef worker():\n    # Simulate a CPU-bound task\n    result = 0\n    for i in range(1000000):\n        result += math.sqrt(i)\n    return result\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    jobs = []\n    for i in range(multiprocessing.cpu_count()):  # Match number of processes to CPU cores\n        p = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker)\n        jobs.append(p)\n        p.start()\n    \n    for job in jobs:\n        job.join()\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy focusing on CPU-bound tasks and matching the number of processes to the number of CPU cores, you should be able to achieve better CPU utilization. Note that the OS will always have some control over process scheduling, so 100% utilization isn't always achievable due to other system processes and overhead."
