The y-axis label is visible, but the x-axis label is being cut off at the bottom. Here is an example of the issue I am facing:\n\n```python\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(ncols=2, nrows=2, figsize=(8, 6))\naxes = axes.flatten()\n\nfor ax in axes:\n    ax.set_ylabel(r'$\\ln\\left(\\frac{x_a-x_b}{x_a-x_c}\\right)$')\n    ax.set_xlabel(r'$\\ln\\left(\\frac{x_a-x_d}{x_a-x_e}\\right)$')\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nAlso, I have tried changing the figure size but it doesn't seem to help. I am looking for a way to make matplotlib recognize automatically that the label is cut off and resize accordingly."

        "content": "To address the issue of labels being cut off in Matplotlib when using subplots, you can adjust the layout of your figure to ensure all labels are properly visible. Here are a few methods to achieve this:\n\n1. **Tight Layout:**\n   You can use the `plt.tight_layout()` function, which automatically adjusts the subplot parameters to give specified padding. This is often the easiest solution.\n\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n   fig, axes = plt.subplots(ncols=2, nrows=2, figsize=(8, 6))\n   axes = axes.flatten()\n\n   for ax in axes:\n       ax.set_ylabel(r'$\\ln\\left(\\frac{x_a-x_b}{x_a-x_c}\\right)$')\n       ax.set_xlabel(r'$\\ln\\left(\\frac{x_a-x_d}{x_a-x_e}\\right)$')\n\n   plt.tight_layout()\n   plt.show()\n   ```\n\n2. **Constrained Layout:**\n   Another option is to use `constrained_layout=True` when creating the figure. This approach is designed to automatically adjust the spacing between subplots to accommodate labels and titles.\n\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n   fig, axes = plt.subplots(ncols=2, nrows=2, figsize=(8, 6), constrained_layout=True)\n   axes = axes.flatten()\n\n   for ax in axes:\n       ax.set_ylabel(r'$\\ln\\left(\\frac{x_a-x_b}{x_a-x_c}\\right)$')\n       ax.set_xlabel(r'$\\ln\\left(\\frac{x_a-x_d}{x_a-x_e}\\right)$')\n\n   plt.show()\n   ```\n\n3. **Manual Adjustment:**\n   If the above methods do not work as desired, you can manually adjust the subplot parameters using `figure.subplots_adjust()`. This method provides more control over the spacing:\n\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n   fig, axes = plt.subplots(ncols=2, nrows=2, figsize=(8, 6))\n   axes = axes.flatten()\n\n   for ax in axes:\n       ax.set_ylabel(r'$\\ln\\left(\\frac{x_a-x_b}{x_a-x_c}\\right)$')\n       ax.set_xlabel(r'$\\ln\\left(\\frac{x_a-x_d}{x_a-x_e}\\right)$')\n\n   plt.subplots_adjust(left=0.1, bottom=0.2, right=0.9, top=0.9, wspace=0.4, hspace=0.4)\n   plt.show()\n   ```\n\nEach of these methods can be effective depending on the specific layout and content of your plots. Try them out and see which one works best for your specific scenario."
