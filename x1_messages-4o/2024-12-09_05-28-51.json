        "content": "In Bokeh, you can indeed enable tooltips for only select glyphs. However, it requires a bit of a workaround since tooltips are generally applied to all glyphs in a plot. Here are two approaches you can consider:\n\n1. **Conditional Tooltips using CustomJS**: You can use a `CustomJS` callback to conditionally display tooltips based on certain criteria. This approach is more complex and involves writing JavaScript code to customize the behavior of the tooltips.\n\n2. **Layering Plots**: You can plot two figures on top of each other as a workaround. This involves creating two separate glyphs and layering them on the same plot where one has tooltips and the other does not. Here's a basic example of how you might accomplish this:\n\n   ```python\n   from bokeh.plotting import figure, show\n   from bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource, HoverTool\n\n   # Data\n   data = {\n       'x': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n       'y': [2, 5, 8, 2, 7],\n       'selected': [True, False, True, False, True]  # Boolean flag for selection\n   }\n\n   source = ColumnDataSource(data=data)\n\n   # Create a figure\n   p = figure(tools=\"pan,wheel_zoom,box_zoom,reset\")\n\n   # Plot all glyphs\n   p.circle('x', 'y', size=10, source=source, color='gray')\n\n   # Plot only selected glyphs with tooltips\n   selected_source = ColumnDataSource(data={k: [v[i] for i in range(len(v)) if data['selected'][i]] for k, v in data.items()})\n   glyph = p.circle('x', 'y', size=10, source=selected_source, color='blue')\n\n   # Add tooltips to the selected glyphs\n   hover = HoverTool(renderers=[glyph], tooltips=[(\"x\", \"@x\"), (\"y\", \"@y\")])\n   p.add_tools(hover)\n\n   # Show the plot\n   show(p)\n   ```\n\nIn this example, two sets of circles are plotted: all data points are plotted in gray without tooltips, and the selected data points are plotted in blue with tooltips. You can adjust the criteria for selection as needed.\n\nThis approach effectively allows you to have tooltips for only a subset of your data points by layering them on top of each other."
