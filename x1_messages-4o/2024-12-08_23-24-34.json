Here's how you can write the SQL query using the LaTeX `lstlisting` environment:\n\n```latex\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]\nSELECT SUM(num1 + num2) FROM numbers;\n\\end{lstlisting}\n```\n\nThis uses the `language=SQL` option to format the SQL query appropriately. Make sure you have the `listings` package included in your LaTeX document preamble:\n\n```latex\n\\usepackage{listings}\n```\n\nThis will correctly display your SQL query in a code block format within your LaTeX document."
