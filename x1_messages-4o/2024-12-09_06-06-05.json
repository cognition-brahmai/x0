However, Python 3.6 is raising a `SyntaxError: 'yield from' inside async function`. Here is my code:\n\n```python\nasync def read_file(self, filename):\n    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='r', delete=True, dir='/tmp', prefix='sftp') as tmp_file:\n        await self.copy_file(filename, tmp_file)\n        yield from open(tmp_file)\n```\n\nAnd here is the exception Python 3.6 raises for the above code:\n\n```python\n  File \"example.py\", line 4\n    yield from open(tmp_file)\n    ^\nSyntaxError: 'yield from' inside async function\n```"

        "content": "In Python 3.6, you cannot use `yield from` inside an `async` function. This is because `async def` functions are designed to work with `await` and `async for`/`async with` constructs, not with traditional generators. In an `async def` function, you need to use `await` to work with asynchronous operations, and you use `async for` to iterate over asynchronous iterators.\n\nTo achieve the behavior you're aiming for, you should use `async for` to consume an asynchronous generator. Here's how you can rewrite your code to be compatible with the async paradigm:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport aiofiles  # You need to install aiofiles using: pip install aiofiles\nimport tempfile\n\nasync def read_file(self, filename):\n    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='r', delete=True, dir='/tmp', prefix='sftp') as tmp_file:\n        await self.copy_file(filename, tmp_file.name)\n        \n        # Use aiofiles to read the file asynchronously\n        async with aiofiles.open(tmp_file.name, mode='r') as f:\n            async for line in f:\n                yield line\n\n# Example usage\nasync def main():\n    # Assuming you have an instance of a class with a copy_file method\n    # that copies a file to the given destination.\n    reader = YourClassWithCopyFileMethod()\n    async for line in reader.read_file('your_file.txt'):\n        print(line)\n\n# To run the async function\n# asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nHere's what has been changed:\n1. Used `aiofiles` to handle file operations asynchronously.\n2. Replaced `yield from` with `async for` to iterate over lines in the file asynchronously.\n\nWith these changes, your function will be compatible with Python's async I/O model, and you can use it effectively in an async context. Make sure to install `aiofiles` if you haven't already, as it is not part of the standard library."
