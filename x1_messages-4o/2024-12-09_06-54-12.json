However, after upgrading to 1.7, I am encountering a warning when running `python manage.py check`. The warning is as follows: \n\n```\nSystem check identified some issues:\n\nWARNINGS:\n?: (1_6.W001) Some project unittests may not execute as expected.\n    HINT: Django 1.6 introduced a new default test runner. It looks like this project was generated using Django 1.5 or earlier. You should ensure your tests are all running & behaving as expected. See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.6/#new-test-runner for more information.\n```\n\nThe URL mentioned in the error message explains the changes that have been made, but it does not give any hint as to why this warning is triggered or how to suppress it. The warning message references Django 1.6, but it only started appearing after upgrading to Django 1.7. I have confirmed that the same number of unit tests is being run under Django 1.7 as was being run under Django 1.6.1. The application in question is an event management system called Kompassi that can be found on Github. How can I suppress this warning?"

        "content": "The warning you're seeing is related to changes in the default test runner introduced in Django 1.6. Even though you have upgraded to Django 1.7, the warning is still present because it applies to projects that were originally created with versions prior to 1.6.\n\nHere's how you can address or suppress the warning:\n\n1. **Update Test Runner**: If you haven't already, update your test runner to ensure it's compatible with Django 1.7. Add the following configuration to your `settings.py` file:\n\n   ```python\n   TEST_RUNNER = 'django.test.runner.DiscoverRunner'\n   ```\n\n   This sets the test runner to the one introduced in Django 1.6, which should be used for projects moving forward.\n\n2. **Verify Tests**: Make sure all your tests are compatible with the new test runner. You may need to adjust imports or configurations if the tests rely on any deprecated functionality.\n\n3. **Suppressing the Warning**: If you have ensured that your tests are running as expected and you simply want to suppress the warning, you can use Django's system check silencing feature. Add the following to your `settings.py`:\n\n   ```python\n   SILENCED_SYSTEM_CHECKS = ['1_6.W001']\n   ```\n\n   This will suppress the specific warning you're encountering.\n\n4. **Review the Documentation**: Even though you've read the documentation, make sure to double-check any specific changes that might affect your tests. This can include changes in test discovery patterns or any other configurations that might have been affected by the upgrade.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to suppress the warning while ensuring your tests are running correctly under Django 1.7."
