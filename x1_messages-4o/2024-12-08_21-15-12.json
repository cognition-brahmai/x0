Can you provide a Go code solution?"

        "content": "To solve this problem, you need to calculate the total number of black squares for a given number of floors, considering the repeating pattern every four floors. Each floor in the cycle has a square number of black squares: \n\n- 1st floor: \\(4 = 2^2\\)\n- 2nd floor: \\(9 = 3^2\\)\n- 3rd floor: \\(16 = 4^2\\)\n- 4th floor: \\(25 = 5^2\\)\n\nThe pattern then repeats for the next set of four floors.\n\nTo calculate the total number of black squares for a given number of floors, you can iterate through each floor, determine the corresponding number of black squares based on its position in the cycle, and sum them up.\n\nHere is a Go code solution to calculate this:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n)\n\nfunc totalBlackSquares(floors int) int {\n\t// Array to hold the number of black squares for each of the 4 floors in a pattern\n\tblackSquares := []int{4, 9, 16, 25}\n\ttotal := 0\n\n\tfor i := 0; i < floors; i++ {\n\t\t// Determine which floor in the pattern this is by using modulo\n\t\tpatternFloor := i % 4\n\t\ttotal += blackSquares[patternFloor]\n\t}\n\n\treturn total\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tvar floors int\n\tfmt.Print(\"Enter the number of floors: \")\n\tfmt.Scan(&floors)\n\n\ttotal := totalBlackSquares(floors)\n\tfmt.Printf(\"Total number of black squares for %d floors is: %d\\n\", floors, total)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `blackSquares` slice holds the number of black squares for the 1st to 4th floors in the repeating pattern.\n- The `totalBlackSquares` function iterates through each floor up to the specified number of floors and determines which floor in the 4-floor cycle it corresponds to using the modulo operator (`%`).\n- The total number of black squares is accumulated and returned.\n\nTo use this code, simply compile it and run it, entering the number of floors when prompted. The program will output the total number of black squares for the specified number of floors."
