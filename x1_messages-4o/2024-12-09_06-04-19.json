        "content": "To pretty-print the tree structure to a file using the code from the gist you mentioned, you can follow these steps. The gist provides a simple tree implementation in Python, and we'll use Python's built-in file handling to write the pretty-printed tree to a file.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Understand the Tree Structure**: The gist defines a `Node` class with a `name` and `children`. The `print_tree` function is used to print the tree structure to the console.\n\n2. **Modify the `print_tree` Function**: To write the output to a file, you'll need to modify the `print_tree` function or create a new function that writes to a file instead of printing to the console.\n\n3. **Write to a File**: Use Python's file handling capabilities to write the tree structure to a file.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify the existing code to pretty-print the tree to a file:\n\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, name, children=None):\n        self.name = name\n        self.children = children if children is not None else []\n\n    def __str__(self, level=0):\n        ret = \"\\t\" * level + repr(self.name) + \"\\n\"\n        for child in self.children:\n            ret += child.__str__(level + 1)\n        return ret\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return '<tree node representation>'\n\ndef print_tree_to_file(node, filename):\n    with open(filename, 'w') as file:\n        file.write(node.__str__())\n\n# Example usage:\nroot = Node('root', [\n    Node('child1', [\n        Node('child1.1'),\n        Node('child1.2')\n    ]),\n    Node('child2')\n])\n\n# Write the tree to a file\nprint_tree_to_file(root, 'tree_output.txt')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Node Class**: A class representing each node in the tree. Each node has a `name` and a list of `children`.\n- **__str__ Method**: This method recursively formats the tree structure as a string, with tabs (`\\t`) used for indentation.\n- **print_tree_to_file Function**: This function takes a `Node` object and a `filename` as arguments. It opens the specified file in write mode and writes the string representation of the tree to it.\n\n### Usage:\n\n- Create your tree by instantiating `Node` objects and building the hierarchy.\n- Call the `print_tree_to_file` function with the root of your tree and the desired output filename.\n\nThis approach will create a file named `tree_output.txt` containing the pretty-printed tree structure. Adjust the filename as needed for your application."
