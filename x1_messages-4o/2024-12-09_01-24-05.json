I have an array of dictionaries \"users=[{\"email_hash\": \"fh7834uifre8houi3f\"}, ... ]\" and I am trying to do a POST via \"requests.post()\" with params as \"ads_token\", \"user_id\", \"users\", and \"hash_type\". However, since \"users\" is a few hundred long, I encounter an error stating \"{'status_code': 414, 'reason': 'Request-URI Too Large'}\". Should I consider using \"data\" instead or is there another solution I should follow?"

        "content": "In Python's `requests` library, the `params` and `data` parameters serve distinct purposes when making HTTP requests.\n\n1. **`params`:** This parameter is used to send query parameters in the URL of a GET request. When you pass a dictionary to `params`, it is encoded into the URL. If your server expects certain parameters in the query string, you would use this.\n\n2. **`data`:** This parameter is used to send form-encoded data in the body of a POST request. When you pass a dictionary to `data`, it is encoded into the request body instead of the URL. This is suitable for sending larger amounts of data, like form submissions.\n\nGiven the error message `{'status_code': 414, 'reason': 'Request-URI Too Large'}`, it indicates that the URL is too long because of the large amount of data being passed via `params`. When URLs exceed a certain length, the server cannot process the request.\n\n### Solution\n\nTo resolve the issue, you should move the large \"users\" data to the `data` parameter rather than `params`. This way, the data will be sent in the body of the request instead of the URL. Here's how you could modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\nurl = \"https://your-api-endpoint\"\nads_token = \"your_ads_token\"\nuser_id = \"your_user_id\"\nusers = [{\"email_hash\": \"fh7834uifre8houi3f\"}, ...]\nhash_type = \"your_hash_type\"\n\nresponse = requests.post(\n    url,\n    params={\"ads_token\": ads_token, \"user_id\": user_id, \"hash_type\": hash_type},\n    json={\"users\": users}  # Use 'json' to send JSON-encoded data\n)\n\nprint(response.status_code)\nprint(response.json())\n```\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **JSON Encoding:** If your API expects JSON data, you can use the `json` parameter instead of `data`, which automatically serializes the dictionary to a JSON string. This is generally more convenient and explicit when dealing with JSON payloads.\n  \n- **Large Data Handling:** If the data is extremely large, consider whether the API supports handling such data in chunks or through file uploads. If the API supports it, you might need to look into multi-part uploads or other mechanisms.\n\nBy moving the \"users\" data to the body of the request, you should avoid the 414 error and successfully transmit the necessary information to the server."
