Here's a method you can use:\n\n1. **Customizing the Activation Script:**\n   You can modify the activation script of your virtual environment. This script is typically located at `my_env/bin/activate` (replace `my_env` with your actual environment name).\n\n   Open the `activate` script in a text editor and look for the following line:\n\n   ```bash\n   PS1=\"(`basename \\\"$VIRTUAL_ENV\\\"`) $PS1\"\n   ```\n\n   Comment out or remove this line to prevent the prompt from being modified:\n\n   ```bash\n   # PS1=\"(`basename \\\"$VIRTUAL_ENV\\\"`) $PS1\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Using a Custom PS1:**\n   Alternatively, you can set a custom PS1 in your `.bashrc` that overrides any changes made by the virtual environment activation. Add the following line to your `.bashrc`:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PS1='YourCustomPrompt>'\n   ```\n\n   Replace `'YourCustomPrompt>'` with whatever prompt format you prefer.\n\n3. **Check for Other Scripts:**\n   Ensure there are no other scripts or configurations that might be overriding your settings. Sometimes, other files like `.bash_profile` or `.profile` might also contain configurations that affect your shell's behavior.\n\nAfter making these changes, make sure to reload your shell or source your `.bashrc` file to apply the changes:\n\n```bash\nsource ~/.bashrc\n```\n\nThese steps should help you disable the virtual environment name from appearing in your prompt."
