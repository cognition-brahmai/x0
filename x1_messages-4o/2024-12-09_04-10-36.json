        "content": "Yes, you can run the IPython or Jupyter Notebook server without automatically opening a web browser. This is useful when you want to use a different interface, like Emacs with the 'ein' package. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using the Command Line:**\n   You can start the Jupyter Notebook server with the `--no-browser` option. This prevents it from opening a web browser automatically.\n\n   ```bash\n   jupyter notebook --no-browser\n   ```\n\n   Alternatively, for IPython:\n\n   ```bash\n   ipython notebook --no-browser\n   ```\n\n2. **Configuring Jupyter:**\n   You can also configure Jupyter to never open a browser by default. To do this, you need to modify the Jupyter configuration file (`jupyter_notebook_config.py`). If you don't have this file yet, you can generate it by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   jupyter notebook --generate-config\n   ```\n\n   Then, open the configuration file (usually located in `~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py`) and set the following option:\n\n   ```python\n   c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False\n   ```\n\n3. **Using Emacs with EIN:**\n   Once the server is running without a browser, you can connect to it using Emacs with the 'ein' (Emacs IPython Notebook) package. Make sure you have 'ein' installed and configured in your Emacs setup. You can then use `M-x ein:notebooklist-open` to open the notebook list in Emacs and start working on your notebooks directly from there.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to run the server without launching a browser and use Emacs as your main editor for Jupyter notebooks."
