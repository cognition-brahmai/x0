I'm using MySQL from openserver.ru, a web server similar to WAMP. Could you help me understand and fix this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, `OperationalError: (OperationalError) (2006, 'MySQL server has gone away')`, typically occurs when the MySQL server closes the connection. This can happen for several reasons, such as:\n\n1. **Connection Timeout:** The server might be configured with a timeout, and if a connection is idle for longer than this period, it will be closed.\n2. **Packet Too Large:** MySQL has a maximum packet size, and if you try to send a packet larger than this limit, the server may close the connection.\n3. **Server Shutdown:** The server may have been restarted or shut down.\n\nGiven your description, it seems like the connection is timing out due to inactivity. To address this, you can try the following solutions:\n\n1. **Increase `max_allowed_packet`:**\n   - If you suspect large packets are causing the issue, increase the `max_allowed_packet` value in your MySQL configuration file (`my.cnf` or `my.ini`).\n\n2. **Use `pool_pre_ping`:**\n   - Use SQLAlchemy's `pool_pre_ping` option to ensure connections are valid before using them. This can help in re-establishing connections that have been closed due to inactivity.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code with `pool_pre_ping`:\n\n```python\ndb_engine = create_engine(\n    'mysql://root@127.0.0.1/mind?charset=utf8',\n    pool_size=10,\n    pool_recycle=7200,\n    pool_pre_ping=True  # Add this line\n)\nBase.metadata.create_all(db_engine)\n\nSession = sessionmaker(bind=db_engine, autoflush=True)\nSession = scoped_session(Session)\nsession = Session()\n\n# your code\n\nsession.close()\n```\n\n3. **Adjust `wait_timeout`:**\n   - You can increase the `wait_timeout` setting in your MySQL server configuration. This setting controls how long the server waits before closing an inactive connection.\n\nTo change `wait_timeout`, add or modify the following lines in your MySQL configuration file:\n\n```ini\n[mysqld]\nwait_timeout=28800\ninteractive_timeout=28800\n```\n\nThen, restart your MySQL server.\n\n4. **Keep Alive at the Application Level:**\n   - You can implement a keep-alive mechanism in your application to periodically execute lightweight queries to keep the connection alive.\n\nImplementing these changes should help resolve the issue you're experiencing. Adjust the values and configurations according to your specific use case and server settings."
