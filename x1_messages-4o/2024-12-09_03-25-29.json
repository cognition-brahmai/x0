I have two functions defined as below:\n\n```python\ndef sub3(n):\n    return n - 3\n\ndef square(n):\n    return n * n\n```\nI can compose them easily as shown below:\n\n```python\nmy_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n[square(sub3(n)) for n in my_list]\n```\nHowever, to use this composition as a key, I need to use them in another function which calls both functions in turn:\n\n```python\nsorted(my_list, key=lambda n: square(sub3(n)))\n```\nI would like to use the composition directly such as `sorted(my_list, key=square*sub3)`, but I get a TypeError when I try to do this:\n\n```python\nsquare * sub3\n# Output: TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'function' and 'function'\n```\nI tried defining `__mul__` for the function type, but received a TypeError:\n\n```python\ntype(sub3).__mul__ = 'something'\n# Output: TypeError: can't set attributes of built-in/extension type 'function'\n```\nI also tried creating a ComposableFunction class extending the function type, but received a TypeError:\n\n```python\nclass ComposableFunction(types.FunctionType):\n    pass\n# Output: TypeError: Error when calling the metaclass bases\n#    type 'function' is not an acceptable base type\n```\nI managed to get some results with a Hack class, but I don't want to use a callable class as the scoping rules are different and it's arguably even uglier than just using lambda. Is it possible to get composition working directly with functions somehow?"

        "content": "In Python, you cannot directly multiply functions using the `*` operator because functions are not numeric types, and Python doesn't define multiplication for them. However, you can create a utility that allows you to compose functions in a more elegant way than using lambdas everywhere. One common approach is to define a function composition utility. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Function Composition Utility\n\nYou can create a simple utility function that composes two functions:\n\n```python\ndef compose(f, g):\n    return lambda x: f(g(x))\n```\n\n### Using the Composition Utility\n\nYou can then use this `compose` utility to combine `square` and `sub3`:\n\n```python\n# Define your functions\ndef sub3(n):\n    return n - 3\n\ndef square(n):\n    return n * n\n\n# Compose them\ncomposed_function = compose(square, sub3)\n\n# Use the composed function\nmy_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nresult = [composed_function(n) for n in my_list]\nprint(result)\n\n# Use it as a key in sorted\nsorted_list = sorted(my_list, key=composed_function)\nprint(sorted_list)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **`compose(f, g)`** returns a new function that applies `g` and then `f` to its argument.\n- **`composed_function(n)`** first subtracts 3 from `n` and then squares the result.\n\n### Advanced Approach\n\nIf you want to extend this to allow chaining multiple functions together, you can create a more sophisticated composition utility:\n\n```python\ndef compose(*functions):\n    def composed_function(x):\n        for f in reversed(functions):\n            x = f(x)\n        return x\n    return composed_function\n```\n\n### Using the Advanced Composition Utility\n\nThis allows chaining multiple functions together:\n\n```python\ncomposed_function = compose(square, sub3)  # You can add more functions if needed\n\n# Use as before\nmy_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nresult = [composed_function(n) for n in my_list]\nprint(result)\n\nsorted_list = sorted(my_list, key=composed_function)\nprint(sorted_list)\n```\n\nWith this utility, you can compose as many functions as you like and still maintain readability and functionality."
