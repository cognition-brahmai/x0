This error occurs even when I set result.result_str to a simple ascii string like \"abc\". I am new to Jinja2 and Python, how can I investigate and resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The `UnicodeDecodeError` you're encountering is a common issue when working with strings and encoding in Python 2.6. This typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the expected encoding and the actual encoding of your strings. Here's how you can investigate and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - In Python 2.x, there are two types of strings: `str` (byte string) and `unicode` (Unicode string).\n   - The error occurs when Python tries to convert a byte string to a Unicode string using the default ASCII codec, which can't handle non-ASCII characters.\n\n2. **Check Your Data:**\n   - Ensure that all string data being passed to Jinja2 templates is properly encoded/decoded.\n   - If your data sources include non-ASCII characters, you should know their encoding (e.g., UTF-8).\n\n3. **Decode Input Strings:**\n   - Convert byte strings to Unicode strings before rendering them in the template.\n   - Use `.decode('utf-8')` if your input strings are UTF-8 encoded.\n\n   ```python\n   result_str = result.result_str.decode('utf-8')\n   ```\n\n   Make sure you only decode byte strings, not already decoded Unicode strings.\n\n4. **Set Default Encoding:**\n   - Although not recommended for new code, you can set the default encoding for your Python session by adding the following lines to the top of your script. However, this is more of a workaround than a solution:\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   reload(sys)\n   sys.setdefaultencoding('utf-8')\n   ```\n\n   Note: `reload(sys)` and `sys.setdefaultencoding()` are only available in Python 2, and using them is discouraged for production code.\n\n5. **Ensure Jinja2 Handles Unicode:**\n   - Jinja2 can handle Unicode strings. Ensure your template variables are Unicode:\n\n   ```python\n   template.render(result_str=u\"abc\")  # Use the 'u' prefix for Unicode strings\n   ```\n\n6. **Debugging:**\n   - Add debug prints to check the type of strings and their encodings.\n   - Use `print type(variable)` and `print repr(variable)` to inspect what you're working with.\n\n7. **Upgrade Python Version (if possible):**\n   - Consider upgrading to Python 3, where string handling is more straightforward, with `str` representing Unicode by default.\n\nBy ensuring that all strings are properly decoded to Unicode before rendering with Jinja2, you should be able to avoid the `UnicodeDecodeError`."
