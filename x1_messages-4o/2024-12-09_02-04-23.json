For example, the new array might look like this:\n\n```python\nb = [[a4,  b4,  c4], [a99, b99, c99]]\n```"

        "content": "To randomly select two rows from a 2D numpy array without replacement, you can use the `numpy.random.choice` function along with array slicing. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Example array\na = np.array([[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2], ..., [an, bn, cn]])\n\n# Randomly select two indices without replacement\nindices = np.random.choice(a.shape[0], size=2, replace=False)\n\n# Use the indices to select rows from the array\nb = a[indices]\n\nprint(b)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening in the code:\n\n1. Convert your list `a` into a numpy array using `np.array()`.\n2. Use `np.random.choice` to select two unique indices from the range of row indices in the array `a`. The `size=2` parameter specifies that you want to select two indices, and `replace=False` ensures that the same index is not selected more than once.\n3. Use the selected indices to slice the array `a` and create the new array `b` that contains the randomly selected rows.\n4. Print the new array `b` to verify the result."
