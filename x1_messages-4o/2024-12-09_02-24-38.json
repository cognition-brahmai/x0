I'm using the following code to generate my plot:\n\n```python\nplt.imshow(g)\nc = plt.colorbar()\nc.set_label(\"Number of Slabs\")\nplt.savefig(\"OutputToUse.png\")\n```\nHowever, the resulting figure has a lot of white space on either side of the plot. I've searched online and read the matplotlib documentation, but I can't seem to find a solution to reduce this."

        "content": "To reduce the left and right margins in your matplotlib plot, you can adjust the figure's layout using the `bbox_inches` parameter in the `savefig` function and the `tight_layout` function. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nplt.imshow(g)\nc = plt.colorbar()\nc.set_label(\"Number of Slabs\")\n\n# Adjust layout\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n# Save the figure with reduced margins\nplt.savefig(\"OutputToUse.png\", bbox_inches='tight')\n```\n\nThe `tight_layout()` function automatically adjusts the subplot parameters to give specified padding and try to fit the elements of the plot within the figure area. The `bbox_inches='tight'` parameter in `savefig` helps to reduce the amount of whitespace around the figure by adjusting the bounding box of the saved figure to fit the contents tightly. This should help in reducing the left and right margins in your output plot."
