I know I can create a map like {'\u015b':'s', '\u0107': 'c'} and use a replace function, but I don't want to hardcode all equivalents into my program. I'm looking for an existing function that can handle this."

        "content": "Yes, there are libraries and functions that can help you replace special characters in a string with their ASCII equivalents, a process known as \"transliteration.\" One popular library that can achieve this is `Unidecode` in Python. It provides a straightforward way to convert Unicode text into plain ASCII.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use `Unidecode` to achieve the desired transformation:\n\n```python\nfrom unidecode import unidecode\n\ntext = \"Cze\u015b\u0107\"\nascii_text = unidecode(text)\nprint(ascii_text)  # Output: Czesc\n```\n\nThe `unidecode` function takes a Unicode string and returns a best-effort ASCII representation. It handles a wide range of special characters and is quite effective for many languages. You can install the `Unidecode` library using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install Unidecode\n```\n\nThis approach saves you from manually mapping each special character to its ASCII equivalent, offering a more automated and comprehensive solution."
