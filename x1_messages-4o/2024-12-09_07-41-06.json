Use the -cpperraswarn option to continue swig processing. error: command 'swig' failed with exit status 1\". I do not have control over a larger script that installs M2Crypto in a virtualenv, so I am looking for a way to fix this by changing something in my system configuration. How can I solve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is indicative of an issue with the OpenSSL development package (`openssl-devel`) that's installed on your system. It seems like the package might not be compatible with your system's architecture. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify OpenSSL and OpenSSL-devel Package Versions:**\n   - Ensure that both `openssl` and `openssl-devel` packages are installed and are compatible with your architecture. You can check this with:\n     ```bash\n     rpm -qa | grep openssl\n     ```\n   - If you find any discrepancies, you may need to update or reinstall these packages. Use:\n     ```bash\n     sudo yum update openssl openssl-devel\n     ```\n\n2. **Install Missing Development Tools:**\n   - Make sure you have all the necessary development tools installed. You can do this by installing the 'Development Tools' package group:\n     ```bash\n     sudo yum groupinstall \"Development Tools\"\n     ```\n\n3. **Install SWIG:**\n   - Ensure that you have the latest version of SWIG installed. You can install it using:\n     ```bash\n     sudo yum install swig\n     ```\n\n4. **Check for 64-bit Compatibility:**\n   - Ensure that the OpenSSL libraries are 64-bit compatible. You can verify the architecture of these libraries:\n     ```bash\n     file /usr/lib64/libssl.so\n     file /usr/lib64/libcrypto.so\n     ```\n   - These commands should indicate that the libraries are for x86_64. If they are not, you may need to reinstall the correct version of OpenSSL.\n\n5. **Modify SWIG Invocation:**\n   - If possible, modify the SWIG command to include the `-cpperraswarn` option. Although you mentioned you can't change the larger script, if there's any way to intercept or wrap the SWIG call, you could add this option to bypass the architecture warning:\n     ```bash\n     swig -cpperraswarn ...\n     ```\n\n6. **Alternative Python Package:**\n   - If M2Crypto is proving too problematic, you might consider using an alternative package like `pyOpenSSL` that might not have the same dependencies on SWIG.\n\n7. **Custom OpenSSL Build:**\n   - As a last resort, you can build OpenSSL from source ensuring that it is compatible with your system's architecture. After building, make sure to use this custom version when building M2Crypto.\n\nFollowing these steps should help you resolve the issue and successfully install M2Crypto in your virtual environment."
