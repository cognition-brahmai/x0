        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to the shape of the input data you're passing to the model. Specifically, the model is expecting a single NumPy array (a 2D array) as input, but it seems like you're passing a list of individual arrays instead.\n\nHere's how to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Correct Input Data Format**: Your input data, `X`, should be a single NumPy array with shape `(12859, 200)`, not a list of 12859 arrays. Each row of this array should represent a single input sample with 200 features.\n\n2. **Convert List to NumPy Array**: If `X` is currently a list of lists, you need to convert it to a NumPy array. You can do this using the `numpy` library:\n\n    ```python\n    import numpy as np\n\n    # Assuming X is a list of lists\n    X = np.array(X)\n    ```\n\n3. **Check Your Data Shape**: After converting `X` to a NumPy array, double-check its shape to ensure it matches the expected shape:\n\n    ```python\n    print(X.shape)  # Should output: (12859, 200)\n    ```\n\n4. **Model Input Shape**: Your model's input layer should have the input shape specified as `(200,)`, which means each sample has 200 features. You should not specify the number of samples (12859) in the `input_shape` parameter; it should only reflect the number of features for each sample.\n\n5. **Training the Model**: With these adjustments, you should be able to train your model without errors:\n\n    ```python\n    model.fit(X, Y, nb_epoch=100, verbose=1)\n    ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the input shape error and train your MLP model successfully."
