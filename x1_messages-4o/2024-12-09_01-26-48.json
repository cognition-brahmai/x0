As an example, in the below mentioned code, I'm using named groups in Python's regular expression module 're'. \n\n```python\nimport re\nmatch = re.search('(?P<name>.*) (?P<phone>.*)', 'John 123456')\nmatch.group('name')\n'John'\n```\n\nI couldn't find any information regarding this in the official documentation. Understanding what \"P\" stands for could potentially help my students remember this syntax better."

        "content": "In Python's regular expression syntax, the `(?P<group_name>regexp)` pattern is used for named capturing groups. The \"P\" in this pattern stands for \"Python,\" indicating that it is a Python-specific extension to the regular expression syntax. Named groups allow you to assign a name to a specific part of the match, making it easier to reference and improve code readability, especially when dealing with complex patterns.\n\nIn your example:\n\n```python\nimport re\nmatch = re.search('(?P<name>.*) (?P<phone>.*)', 'John 123456')\n```\n\n- `(?P<name>.*)` defines a named group with the name `name`. It captures everything up to a space.\n- `(?P<phone>.*)` defines another named group with the name `phone`. It captures everything after the space.\n\nUsing `match.group('name')`, you can easily retrieve the captured value associated with the `name` group, which in this case is 'John'. This feature is particularly useful for keeping track of various parts of a match when dealing with complex patterns."
