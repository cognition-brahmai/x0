According to the Django documentation, if I set unique=True for a field in my model, it must be unique throughout the table. This is enforced at the database level and by model validation. If I attempt to save a model with a duplicate value in a unique field, a django.db.IntegrityError should be raised by the model\u2019s save() method. However, in my case, it's not happening. I have a model with an auto-incrementing primary key and a URL field that is set to be unique. The model is as follows:\n\n```python\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n    url = models.URLField(\"URL\", unique=True)\n    text = models.TextField(max_length=1000)\n```\n\nThe SQL generated by Django for this model is:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE `MyModel_mymodel` (\n    `id` integer AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,\n     `url` varchar(200) NOT NULL UNIQUE,\n     `text` varchar(1000) NOT NULL,\n)\n```\n\nDespite this, within the Django shell, I can create multiple instances of `MyModel` with the same URL and save them without any errors:\n\n```python\n>>> from MyModel.models import MyModel\n>>> MyModel().save() \n>>> MyModel(url=\"blah\").save() \n>>> MyModel(url=\"blah\").save() \n```\n\nThe models are saved without issue and the only difference between them is the auto-incrementing primary key. I'm using Django 1.5 and a MySQL database. Could you possibly help me understand what might be causing this? I should note that I am using a custom manager, but I don't believe that's the issue."

        "content": "There are a few potential reasons why the `unique=True` constraint might not be working as expected in your Django model. Let's go through some possibilities and troubleshooting steps:\n\n1. **Database Schema Mismatch**: Ensure that the database schema is up-to-date with your Django models. If you have recently added or changed the `unique=True` constraint, the database schema might not have been updated. You can run the following commands to ensure that the schema is in sync:\n   - If you're using Django 1.5, which predates the built-in migrations system introduced in Django 1.7, you might be using South for migrations. Run `./manage.py schemamigration MyModel --auto` followed by `./manage.py migrate MyModel`.\n\n2. **Database Connection Issues**: Verify that Django is connected to the correct database. Check your `settings.py` to ensure that the database configuration is pointing to the right instance.\n\n3. **Manager or Model Override**: Double-check if your custom manager or model methods override the default behavior of the `save()` method. It's possible that the `save()` method is being overridden in a way that bypasses the unique constraint check.\n\n4. **Transaction Issues**: Sometimes, unique constraints are not enforced until the transaction is committed. Make sure that your database transactions are being committed properly. This can be particularly relevant if you are using custom transaction management.\n\n5. **Database-Specific Behavior**: MySQL can sometimes behave differently concerning constraints. Check the storage engine used by your MySQL database. If it's MyISAM, switch it to InnoDB as MyISAM does not support foreign key constraints and may behave inconsistently with unique constraints.\n\n6. **Check the SQL Output**: Use the Django `dbshell` command to manually check the constraints on your table:\n   ```sql\n   SHOW CREATE TABLE `MyModel_mymodel`;\n   ```\n   Ensure that the `url` column has a `UNIQUE` constraint in the generated SQL.\n\n7. **Test Directly with SQL**: Try inserting duplicate entries directly using SQL in your database management tool to see if the constraint is enforced there. This can help determine if the issue is within the Django layer or at the database level.\n\nIf none of the above steps resolve the issue, consider checking for any potential bugs in the specific Django version you're using or upgrading to a newer version of Django if possible."
