        "content": "Develop an AI-powered wardrobe management system for a luxury fashion brand, that uses computer vision to analyze clothing items and recommend outfit combinations based on the wearer's personal style and body type. The system should also provide personalized fashion advice and trends forecasting, taking into account the user's location and weather conditions. It should be equipped with a virtual stylist feature that allows customers to try on outfits in a 3D simulated environment. The system must prioritize user data privacy and security by using advanced encryption techniques and limiting access to authorized personnel only."
