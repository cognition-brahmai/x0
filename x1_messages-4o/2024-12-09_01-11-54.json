I have a 2D array X and I want to create a new variable Y which is a copy of X. However, I want changes to Y to not affect X. I've tried using y = x, but this seems to create a reference rather than a copy. When I change Y, X changes as well. Using y = x[:] doesn't seem to work for 2D arrays either. For instance, when I run the following code:\n\n```python\nx = [[1,2],[3,4]]\ny = x[:]\ny[0][0]= 1000\nprint x\n```\nit returns [[1000, 2], [3, 4]], indicating that changes to Y are affecting X. Replacing y = x[:] with y = x[:][:] doesn't solve the problem. What is the proper and simple way to copy a 2D array in Python?"

        "content": "To create a deep copy of a 2D array (or list of lists) in Python such that changes to the copy do not affect the original, you need to use a method that copies the nested lists as well. The issue with using `y = x[:]` or `y = x[:][:]` is that these methods only create a shallow copy, meaning the outer list is copied but the references to the inner lists remain the same. To achieve a deep copy, you can use the `copy` module, specifically the `deepcopy` function. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport copy\n\nx = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]\ny = copy.deepcopy(x)\ny[0][0] = 1000\n\nprint(x)  # Output: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]\nprint(y)  # Output: [[1000, 2], [3, 4]]\n```\n\nUsing `copy.deepcopy(x)` ensures that all nested lists are also copied, so `y` becomes a completely independent copy of `x`. Changes to `y` will not affect `x`, as demonstrated in the example above."
