If this doesn't exist, what would be the best alternative method to find out the version of a package that I'm currently using?"

        "content": "To determine the version of a specific package that is currently installed in your Python environment, you can use the following methods:\n\n1. **Using pip show:**\n   You can use the `pip show` command followed by the package name to get detailed information about the package, including its version. For example, to find out the version of the package `XYZ`, you can run:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip show XYZ\n   ```\n\n   This will display several details about the package, including the version number.\n\n2. **Using pip list:**\n   You can also use the `pip list` command to see all installed packages along with their versions. If you want to filter the output to find a specific package, you can use `grep` on Unix-based systems or `findstr` on Windows. For example:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip list | grep XYZ   # On Unix-based systems\n   pip list | findstr XYZ  # On Windows\n   ```\n\n   This will give you the version of the `XYZ` package if it is installed.\n\n3. **Using Python code:**\n   You can also check the version of a package using Python code. You can import the package and then access its `__version__` attribute. Here's an example:\n\n   ```python\n   import XYZ\n   print(XYZ.__version__)\n   ```\n\n   Replace `XYZ` with the actual package name. Note that not all packages may have the `__version__` attribute, but most well-maintained packages do.\n\nThese methods will help you determine the installed version of a specific package in your environment."
