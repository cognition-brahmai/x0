I have tried to achieve this using matplotlib by setting the figure size in inches and setting the dpi to 1. However, I am encountering an issue where Python states that the width and height must each be below 32768. How can I save an image of exact size in pixels using matplotlib, without converting to inches or adjusting dpi?\n\nHere's the code I tried:\n\n```python\nw = 7195\nh = 3841\nfig = plt.figure(frameon=False)\nfig.set_size_inches(w,h)\nax = plt.Axes(fig, [0., 0., 1., 1.])\nax.set_axis_off()\nfig.add_axes(ax)\nax.imshow(im_np, aspect='normal')\nfig.savefig(some_path, dpi=1)\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the limitations in the size that can be handled by matplotlib when you directly set the figure size in inches multiplied by DPI, which results in a large number of pixels. Matplotlib has a limit on the maximum number of pixels it can handle due to its backend limitations.\n\nTo save an image with the exact pixel dimensions you want, you can use a workaround by saving the image directly using PIL (Python Imaging Library) or OpenCV, which are more suited for handling large images directly in pixel terms. Here's an example of how you can achieve this using PIL:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Assuming im_np is your image array of shape (3841, 7195, 3) or (3841, 7195) for grayscale\nimage = Image.fromarray(im_np)\n\n# Save the image directly with the desired dimensions\nimage.save(some_path)\n```\n\nIf your image is in a different format, ensure that the array `im_np` is in the correct shape and type for PIL to handle it. For instance, it should be a uint8 array for typical RGB or grayscale images.\n\nBy using PIL, you bypass the need to handle DPI and figure sizes in inches, and directly work with pixel dimensions, thus avoiding the limitations encountered with matplotlib."
