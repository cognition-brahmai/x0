        "content": "To determine the molecular weight of carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), we need to sum the atomic weights of its constituent atoms. Carbon dioxide consists of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.\n\n1. The atomic weight of carbon (C) is approximately 12.01 atomic mass units (amu).\n2. The atomic weight of oxygen (O) is approximately 16.00 amu.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of carbon dioxide is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Molecular weight of CO}_2 = (1 \\times 12.01) + (2 \\times 16.00) \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Molecular weight of CO}_2 = 12.01 + 32.00 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Molecular weight of CO}_2 = 44.01 \\, \\text{amu} \\]\n\nSo, the molecular weight of carbon dioxide is approximately 44.01 amu."
