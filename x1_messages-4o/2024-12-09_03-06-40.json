I am trying to use admin.LogEntry objects during a data migration on Django 1.7. The app 'django.contrib.admin' is listed in INSTALLED_APPS. It works in the shell, but fails during migration. Using a debugger, I found that 'admin' is not installed. Can you help me understand why this is happening?\n\n```python\n>>> from django.apps import apps\n>>> apps.get_model('admin', 'LogEntry')\ndjango.contrib.admin.models.LogEntry\n\ndef do_it(apps, schema_editor):\n    LogEntry = apps.get_model('admin', 'LogEntry')\n```\nThe error message is:\n```bash\ndjango-admin migrate\n(...)\nLookupError: No installed app with label 'admin'.\n```\nDebugger output:\n```bash\nipdb> apps.get_apps()\n[]\nipdb> apps.all_models.keys()\n['website', 'google', 'allauth', 'twitter', 'busca', 'conteudo', 'django_mobile', 'django_filters', 'videocenter', 'tinymce', 'oferta', 'programacaotv', 'contenttypes', 'suit', 'haystack', 'destaque', 'filer', 'galeria', 'auth', 'facebook', 'paintstore', 'critica', 'disqus', 'fichas', 'omeletop', 'autocomplete_light', 'modelsv1', 'temas', 'django_extensions', 'adv_cache_tag', 'taggit', 'social', 'personalidade']\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"No installed app with label 'admin'\", during Django migrations, even though the app is listed in `INSTALLED_APPS`, is typically related to how Django's migration framework loads applications and models.\n\nHere's what's happening:\n\n1. **Migration Context**: During migrations, Django uses a special migration context which doesn't necessarily load all apps as they are loaded when the server is running or when you're using the Django shell. This context is designed to work with historical models as they were at the time of each migration. Therefore, not all apps or their models are available in the same way they are outside of this context.\n\n2. **`apps.get_model` in Migrations**: When you use `apps.get_model('admin', 'LogEntry')` within a migration function, it's using the migration's isolated app registry. The error indicates that `django.contrib.admin` is not available in this registry during the migration, which is expected for certain built-in applications not directly related to your database schema.\n\n3. **Direct Database Access in Migrations**: If you need to access models like `LogEntry` from `django.contrib.admin` during a migration, you'll have to work around the migration's restricted app registry. This generally involves importing and using the model directly outside the migration's managed context. However, this is not a recommended practice, as it breaks the isolation intended by Django's migration framework.\n\nTo work around this:\n\n- **Avoid Using Admin Models in Migrations**: Ideally, avoid accessing models from the `admin` app during migrations. The `admin` app is primarily for administration and doesn't usually participate directly in data migrations.\n\n- **Alternative Approach**: If you absolutely need to manipulate `admin.LogEntry` during a migration, you can directly import the model, bypassing the migration's `apps` registry:\n\n  ```python\n  from django.contrib.admin.models import LogEntry\n\n  def do_it(apps, schema_editor):\n      # Directly use the LogEntry model\n      log_entries = LogEntry.objects.all()\n      for entry in log_entries:\n          # Perform your operations\n          pass\n  ```\n\n  However, keep in mind that this can introduce dependencies and potential issues, especially if the model changes in future versions.\n\n- **Use Signals or Post-Migration Scripts**: If possible, handle such operations using Django signals or create a separate script to run after the migration process is complete. This keeps migrations clean and focused solely on schema changes.\n\nIn summary, interactions with admin models during migrations should be carefully considered and typically avoided, but direct imports can provide a workaround if necessary."
