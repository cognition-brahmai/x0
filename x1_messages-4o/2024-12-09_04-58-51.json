The folder contains two csv files, test1.csv and test2.csv. When I run my script, the combined.csv file has all the appended rows, but the first two columns have moved to the end and it seems to be appending at the first line rather than at the last. What am I missing and how can I remove the 0s and 1s in the first column?\n\nThe script I am using is:\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport glob\n\nall_data = pd.DataFrame()\nfor f in glob.glob(\"testfolder/*.csv\"):\n    df = pd.read_csv(f)\n    all_data = all_data.append(df)\n\nall_data.to_csv('testfolder/combined.csv')\n```"

        "content": "When appending dataframes in pandas, you might encounter issues with column order and unexpected indices if the individual CSV files have different column orders or if the index from each dataframe is not reset. Let's address these concerns and adjust your script to ensure consistent column ordering and to remove any unwanted index columns:\n\n1. **Column Order:** Pandas appends dataframes based on the column names. If your CSV files have columns in different orders or some columns are missing in some files, the result might not be as expected.\n\n2. **Index Issue:** The `append` method retains the index of the dataframes being appended. This can cause issues if the indices are not aligned, leading to unexpected 0s and 1s in the result.\n\nHere's a revised version of your script to handle these issues:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport glob\n\n# Initialize an empty list to store dataframes\nall_dataframes = []\n\n# Iterate over each CSV file in the specified folder\nfor f in glob.glob(\"testfolder/*.csv\"):\n    df = pd.read_csv(f)\n    # Reset index to ensure no index columns are appended\n    df.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)\n    # Append the dataframe to the list\n    all_dataframes.append(df)\n\n# Concatenate all dataframes in the list\nall_data = pd.concat(all_dataframes, ignore_index=True)\n\n# Save the combined dataframe to a CSV file\nall_data.to_csv('testfolder/combined.csv', index=False)\n```\n\n### Key Adjustments:\n\n- **`reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True):`** This resets the index of each individual dataframe before appending, so that the original indices are not carried over into the combined dataframe.\n\n- **`pd.concat(..., ignore_index=True):`** This concatenates all dataframes and resets the index of the resulting dataframe, ensuring a clean, sequential index.\n\n- **`index=False` in `to_csv`:** This ensures that the index is not written to the output CSV file, preventing extra index columns.\n\nBy using `pd.concat` instead of `append`, you can concatenate dataframes more efficiently and handle index issues more effectively. This should resolve the column order and index problems you are experiencing."
