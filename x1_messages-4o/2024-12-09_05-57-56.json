I am able to read from existing workbooks and create new workbooks, but I'm having trouble combining these tasks. I tried using the \"open_workbook\" function from the xlwt module, but it appears to only be a part of the xlrd module. I also tried using the xlutils module as suggested, but I encountered an XLRDError that says \"Can't load sheets after releasing resources.\"\n\nHere is the code I have tried:\n\n```\nfrom xlwt import open_workbook\nwb = open_workbook(\"ex.xls\")\ns = wb.sheet_by_index(0)\nprint s.cell(0,0).value\n```\n\nand\n\n```\nfrom xlrd import open_workbook\nfrom xlwt import Workbook\nfrom xlutils.copy import copy\n\nwb = open_workbook(\"names.xls\")\ns = wb.get_sheet(0)\ns.write(0,0,'A1')\nwb.save('names.xls')\n```"

        "content": "To open an existing workbook, read from it, and then write back to it, you need to use the `xlrd` library for reading and the `xlwt` library for writing. Since `xlrd` is used for reading and `xlwt` for writing, you also need `xlutils.copy` to facilitate copying an existing workbook to a writable format. Here is how you can achieve this:\n\n1. Open the workbook with `xlrd`.\n2. Use `xlutils.copy` to make it writable.\n3. Write to the workbook using the writable copy.\n4. Save the workbook.\n\nHere's an example of how to do it:\n\n```python\nimport xlrd\nfrom xlwt import Workbook\nfrom xlutils.copy import copy\n\n# Open the existing workbook\nrb = xlrd.open_workbook(\"names.xls\")\n\n# Use xlutils.copy to create a writable copy of the workbook\nwb = copy(rb)\n\n# Access the sheet you want to write to\nws = wb.get_sheet(0)  # 0 is the index of the first sheet\n\n# Write to the sheet\nws.write(0, 0, 'A1')  # Write 'A1' to the cell at row 0, column 0\n\n# Save the workbook\nwb.save('names.xls')\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- Ensure you have the `xlrd`, `xlwt`, and `xlutils` libraries installed. You can install them using pip if they are not installed:\n  ```bash\n  pip install xlrd xlwt xlutils\n  ```\n\n- The `get_sheet()` method is used on the writable workbook copy, not on the original workbook opened with `xlrd`.\n\n- Be cautious about overwriting the original file if you intend to preserve it. You might want to save to a different file name for testing purposes.\n\nThis approach allows you to read from and write back to an existing Excel workbook seamlessly."
