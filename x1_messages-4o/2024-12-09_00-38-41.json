Here's my code:\n\n```python\nstart_time = time.time()\nxgb = XGBClassifier(n_estimators = 400, learning_rate = 0.1, max_depth = 3)\nxgb.fit(X_train.values, y_train)\nprint('Fit time : ', time.time() - start_time)\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that the `XGBClassifier` is expecting the target labels (`y`) to be in a specific range, `[0 1 2 3 4 5]`, but your dataset is providing labels in a different range, `[1 2 3 4 5 6]`. This discrepancy is causing the error.\n\nThe issue arises because `XGBClassifier` expects the class labels to start from 0. When your labels start from 1 (or any other number), it interprets them as indices, thus leading to confusion in class identification.\n\nHere's how you can solve this problem:\n\n1. **Adjust the Class Labels**: You need to adjust your target labels so that they start from 0. This can be done by subtracting the minimum label value from all labels. In your case, subtract 1 from all the labels to shift them to start from 0.\n\n    ```python\n    y_train_adjusted = y_train - 1\n    ```\n\n2. **Fit the Model with Adjusted Labels**: Use the adjusted labels to fit your model.\n\n    ```python\n    xgb.fit(X_train.values, y_train_adjusted)\n    ```\n\n3. **Adjust Predictions (Optional)**: If you need predictions in the original label format (starting from 1), you'll need to add 1 back to the predicted labels.\n\n    ```python\n    y_pred = xgb.predict(X_test.values)\n    y_pred_adjusted = y_pred + 1\n    ```\n\nThis should resolve the error, allowing your `XGBClassifier` to work as expected. If your friends are not facing this issue with the same code, they might be using a dataset where labels already start from 0, or their environments handle this automatically."
