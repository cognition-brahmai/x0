Here is my `launch.json` configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n    \"configurations\": [{\n            \"name\": \"Python: Current File\",\n            \"type\": \"python\",\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\n            \"program\": \"${file}\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nI would like to return to the previous setting where the output was displayed only in the \"Debug Console\". Can anyone help me with this?"

        "content": "The change in behavior you're experiencing can be attributed to updates in the VS Code or the Python extension that might have altered the default settings for debugging outputs. To redirect the output back to the \"Debug Console\" instead of the \"Integrated Terminal,\" you can modify your `launch.json` configuration by adding the `\"console\"` property. Here's how you can update your configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n    \"configurations\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Python: Current File\",\n            \"type\": \"python\",\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\n            \"program\": \"${file}\",\n            \"console\": \"internalConsole\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nIn this configuration:\n\n- The `\"console\": \"internalConsole\"` setting specifies that the debug output should be directed to the \"Debug Console\" rather than the \"Integrated Terminal.\"\n\nAfter making this change, save your `launch.json` file and try debugging again. The output should now appear in the \"Debug Console\" as it did before. If you encounter any issues, ensure that your VS Code and Python extension are up-to-date, as settings and features can change with new releases."
