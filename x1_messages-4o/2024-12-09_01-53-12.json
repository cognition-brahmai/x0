When I use the read_excel() function in Pandas to read the excel file and display the dataframe, these two columns are printed in scientific format with exponential notation. How can I prevent Pandas from converting these large numbers to exponential format and retain the original number format?"

        "content": "When you read an Excel file using Pandas and the numbers are displayed in scientific notation, it's usually due to the default settings for displaying floating-point numbers in Pandas. You can adjust the display settings in Pandas to show the numbers in a regular format. Here are a few ways you can do this:\n\n1. **Use the `pd.set_option` function:**\n\n   You can set the display option for floating-point numbers to avoid scientific notation by using `pd.set_option`. For instance, you can set the number format to display more digits:\n\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n\n   # Read your Excel file\n   df = pd.read_excel('your_file.xlsx')\n\n   # Set display option to avoid scientific notation\n   pd.set_option('display.float_format', '{:.0f}'.format)\n\n   # Display the DataFrame\n   print(df)\n   ```\n\n   This will display floating-point numbers without scientific notation, and `{:.0f}` will format them as integers without decimal points.\n\n2. **Convert columns to strings:**\n\n   If you simply need to display the numbers without scientific notation and formatting as integers is acceptable, you can convert the columns to strings after reading the data. This approach will retain the full number as a string:\n\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n\n   # Read your Excel file\n   df = pd.read_excel('your_file.xlsx')\n\n   # Convert specific columns to strings\n   df['Column1'] = df['Column1'].apply(lambda x: '{:.0f}'.format(x))\n   df['Column2'] = df['Column2'].apply(lambda x: '{:.0f}'.format(x))\n\n   # Display the DataFrame\n   print(df)\n   ```\n\n3. **Use the `float_format` parameter in `to_string`:**\n\n   If you want to print the entire DataFrame with numbers formatted without scientific notation, you can use the `to_string` method with the `float_format` parameter:\n\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n\n   # Read your Excel file\n   df = pd.read_excel('your_file.xlsx')\n\n   # Print the DataFrame with custom float format\n   print(df.to_string(float_format='{:,.0f}'.format))\n   ```\n\nBy using any of these methods, you should be able to prevent the conversion of large numbers to exponential format and display them in their original form. Choose the method that best suits your needs based on whether you simply want to display the numbers or retain their format for further processing."
