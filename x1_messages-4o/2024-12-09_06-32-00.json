The error message says that \"x is neither increasing nor decreasing\". However, when I use the roc_auc_score method, it seems to work fine. I'm confused because I thought both methods were the same. Can someone help me understand why is this happening? Here is the code I've used and the error I am getting:\n\n```\nfrom sklearn.metrics import auc\nauc(y_test, y_pred)\n```\n\nI get a ValueError with the following traceback:\n\n```\nValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\n<ipython-input-183-980dc3c4e3d7> in <module>\n----> 1 auc(y_test, y_pred)\n\n~/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sklearn/metrics/ranking.py in auc(x, y, reorder)\n    117             else:\n    118                 raise ValueError(\"x is neither increasing nor decreasing \"\n--> 119                                  \": {}.\".format(x))\n    120 \n    121     area = direction * np.trapz(y, x)\n\nValueError: x is neither increasing nor decreasing : [1 1 1 ... 1 1 1].\n```\n\nThen, when I use roc_auc_score:\n\n```\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\nroc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred)\n```\n\nIt returns: `0.5118361429056588`\n\nHere, `y_test` are the actual target values and `y_pred` are my predicted values."

        "content": "The issue you're encountering arises from a misunderstanding of how the `auc` and `roc_auc_score` functions are meant to be used. Let's clarify the differences between the two:\n\n1. **`auc` Method:**\n   - The `auc` function from `sklearn.metrics` is a generic method that calculates the area under the curve given two arrays: `x` and `y`. These arrays represent the coordinates of points that define the curve. The function expects `x` to be either in increasing or decreasing order.\n   - In your case, you're passing `y_test` and `y_pred` directly, which isn't correct for this function. `auc` is not meant for directly calculating the AUC-ROC score from predictions and true labels.\n\n2. **`roc_auc_score` Method:**\n   - The `roc_auc_score` function is specifically designed to compute the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for binary classification tasks.\n   - It takes the true binary labels (`y_test`) and the target scores (probabilities or decision function scores, not class labels) as input. In your case, `y_pred` should be the predicted probabilities or scores for the positive class, not the class labels themselves.\n\nTo fix the issue and correctly compute the AUC-ROC score using `roc_auc_score`, make sure you're providing it with the predicted probabilities (or scores) rather than the predicted class labels. Here's how you can do it with a KNN classifier:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\n# Assuming you have your data in X and y\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Fit the KNN model\nknn = KNeighborsClassifier()\nknn.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Predict probabilities\ny_pred_prob = knn.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]  # Get probabilities for the positive class\n\n# Calculate the AUC-ROC score\nroc_auc = roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred_prob)\nprint(f'ROC AUC Score: {roc_auc}')\n```\n\nEnsure that `y_pred_prob` contains the predicted probabilities for the positive class. This should resolve your issue and give you the correct AUC-ROC score."
