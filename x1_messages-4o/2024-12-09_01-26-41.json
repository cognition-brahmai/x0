If so, why doesn't the value of a variable change when it's changed in another variable it was assigned to? For instance, when I ran the following code, I expected the output to be `3` but it was `5`. \n```python\ni = 5\nj = i\nj = 3\nprint(i)\n```\nContrarily, when I ran a similar code snippet with a list, the change was reflected. Like in this example:\n```python\ni = [1,2,3]\nj = i\ni[0] = 5\nprint(j)\n```\nThe result was `[5,2,3]`. What am I misunderstanding about Python variables?"

        "content": "In Python, the concept of variables and how they reference data can indeed be a bit confusing at first. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Variables and References:**\n   - In Python, variables are more like references to objects rather than traditional pointers. When you assign a value to a variable, you're essentially assigning a reference to the object in memory.\n\n2. **Immutable vs Mutable Objects:**\n   - **Immutable objects:** These are objects whose state cannot be changed after they are created. Examples include integers, floats, strings, and tuples. When you do an assignment with immutable objects, like in your example with integers, you're copying the reference to the object. When you then assign a new value to `j`, you're not changing the object itself; rather, you're changing the reference `j` to point to a different object (`3` in this case). The original object that `i` points to (`5`) remains unchanged.\n   - **Mutable objects:** These are objects that can be changed after they are created, such as lists, dictionaries, and sets. In your list example, both `i` and `j` refer to the same list object in memory. When you modify the list using `i[0] = 5`, you're changing the content of the list object itself, so both `i` and `j` reflect this change since they both point to the same object.\n\nHere's a summary of the behavior:\n\n- When you assign `j = i` for immutable objects, `j` gets a reference to the same value as `i`. However, when you reassign `j = 3`, you're simply changing `j` to point to a new object (`3`), leaving `i` unchanged.\n- When you assign `j = i` for mutable objects, `j` and `i` both reference the same object. Any modification to the object through either reference will be reflected in both.\n\nUnderstanding this distinction between mutable and immutable objects is key to mastering variable behavior in Python."
