        "content": "Certainly! Here's a simple C program that accepts two integers from the user and displays their sum:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int num1, num2, sum;\n\n    // Prompt the user to enter the first integer\n    printf(\"Enter the first integer: \");\n    scanf(\"%d\", &num1);\n\n    // Prompt the user to enter the second integer\n    printf(\"Enter the second integer: \");\n    scanf(\"%d\", &num2);\n\n    // Calculate the sum of the two integers\n    sum = num1 + num2;\n\n    // Display the sum\n    printf(\"The sum of %d and %d is %d.\\n\", num1, num2, sum);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nTo use this program, simply copy the code into a file with a `.c` extension, such as `sum.c`, and compile it using a C compiler like `gcc`. For example:\n\n```bash\ngcc -o sum sum.c\n```\n\nThen, run the compiled program:\n\n```bash\n./sum\n```\n\nThe program will prompt you to enter two integers and then display their sum."
