        "content": "I am trying to concatenate 'column' vectors using numpy arrays in Python. However, I'm encountering an issue because numpy sees all arrays as row vectors by default. I've tried using `np.hstack` and `np.concatenate` along any axis but they don't seem to help. When I use `np.transpose`, it doesn't work as expected either. Here's the sample code that I've been working with:\n\n```python\na = np.array((0, 1))\nb = np.array((2, 1))\nc = np.array((-1, -1))\n\nnp.hstack((a, b, c))\n# array([ 0,  1,  2,  1, -1, -1])  ## Noooooo\nnp.reshape(np.hstack((a, b, c)), (2, 3))\n# array([[ 0,  1,  2], [ 1, -1, -1]]) ## Reshaping won't help\n```\nOne possibility I've found is to use the following code, but it feels cumbersome and I'm wondering if there's a better way to accomplish this:\n\n```python\nnp.hstack((a[:, np.newaxis], b[:, np.newaxis], c[:, np.newaxis]))\n# array([[ 0,  2, -1], [ 1,  1, -1]]) ##\n```\n\nIs there a more efficient way to concatenate column vectors using numpy arrays?"

        "content": "The issue arises because when you create numpy arrays using `np.array((0, 1))`, they are created as 1-dimensional arrays (essentially row vectors). To concatenate them as column vectors, you need to explicitly shape them as 2-dimensional arrays. You can achieve this more cleanly using `np.column_stack` or by reshaping the arrays when you create them. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Method 1: Using `np.column_stack`\n`np.column_stack` is designed to stack 1-D arrays as columns into a 2-D array:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array((0, 1))\nb = np.array((2, 1))\nc = np.array((-1, -1))\n\nresult = np.column_stack((a, b, c))\nprint(result)\n# Output:\n# array([[ 0,  2, -1],\n#        [ 1,  1, -1]])\n```\n\n### Method 2: Reshaping During Creation\n\nYou can reshape the arrays when you create them to ensure they are column vectors:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array((0, 1)).reshape(-1, 1)\nb = np.array((2, 1)).reshape(-1, 1)\nc = np.array((-1, -1)).reshape(-1, 1)\n\nresult = np.hstack((a, b, c))\nprint(result)\n# Output:\n# array([[ 0,  2, -1],\n#        [ 1,  1, -1]])\n```\n\n### Method 3: Using `np.vstack` with Transpose\n\nIf you prefer to use `np.vstack`, you can transpose the final result:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array((0, 1))\nb = np.array((2, 1))\nc = np.array((-1, -1))\n\nresult = np.vstack((a, b, c)).T\nprint(result)\n# Output:\n# array([[ 0,  2, -1],\n#        [ 1,  1, -1]])\n```\n\nThese methods should give you an efficient way to concatenate the arrays as column vectors. Choose the one that you find most readable and convenient for your use case."
