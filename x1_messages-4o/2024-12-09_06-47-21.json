I've created a class \"Run\" which adds a new filehandle for each run. However, the logfiles for the runs do not get released, which leads to an exhaustion of available handles and a crash after a certain number of runs. How can I ensure that the log files are released after each run to prevent this issue? \n\nThe main routine is:\n\n```python\nimport Model\ntry:\n    myrun = Model.Run('20130315150340_run_49295')\n    ha = raw_input('enter')\n    myrun.log.info(\"some info\")\nexcept:\n    traceback.print_exc(file=sys.stdout)\n\nha = raw_input('enter3')\n```\n\nThe Run class is defined in the Model module as follows:\n\n```python\nimport logging\nclass Run(object):\n    \"\"\" Implements the functionality of a single run. \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, runid):\n        self.logdir = \".\"\n        self.runid = runid\n        self.logFile = os.path.join(self.logdir , self.runid + '.log')\n        self.log = logging.getLogger('Run'+self.runid)\n        myformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s %(name)-12s %(levelname)-8s %(message)s')\n        myhandler = logging.FileHandler(self.logFile)\n        myhandler.setLevel(logging.INFO)\n        myhandler.setFormatter(myformatter)\n        self.log.addHandler(myhandler) \n```"

        "content": "To ensure that the log files are properly closed and file handles are released after each run, you need to close the handlers explicitly. In your current setup, the handlers are being added to the logger, but they are not closed, which leads to exhaustion of file handles.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can modify your `Run` class to properly manage and close the file handlers:\n\n1. Add a method to close the handlers.\n2. Ensure this method is called after you are done with the logging.\n\nHere's an updated version of your `Run` class:\n\n```python\nimport logging\nimport os\n\nclass Run(object):\n    \"\"\" Implements the functionality of a single run. \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, runid):\n        self.logdir = \".\"\n        self.runid = runid\n        self.logFile = os.path.join(self.logdir, self.runid + '.log')\n        self.log = logging.getLogger('Run' + self.runid)\n        self.log.setLevel(logging.INFO)  # Set logger level\n\n        # Check if the logger already has handlers, to avoid duplicate logs\n        if not self.log.hasHandlers():\n            myformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s %(name)-12s %(levelname)-8s %(message)s')\n            myhandler = logging.FileHandler(self.logFile)\n            myhandler.setLevel(logging.INFO)\n            myhandler.setFormatter(myformatter)\n            self.log.addHandler(myhandler)\n\n    def close(self):\n        \"\"\" Close all handlers associated with the logger \"\"\"\n        handlers = self.log.handlers[:]\n        for handler in handlers:\n            handler.close()\n            self.log.removeHandler(handler)\n\n```\n\nAnd in your main routine, make sure to call the `close` method after you are done with a particular run:\n\n```python\nimport Model\nimport traceback\nimport sys\n\ntry:\n    myrun = Model.Run('20130315150340_run_49295')\n    ha = input('enter')  # Use input() instead of raw_input() in Python 3\n    myrun.log.info(\"some info\")\nfinally:\n    # Ensure the resources are cleaned up\n    myrun.close()\n\nha = input('enter3')\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- The `close` method iterates over all handlers of the logger, closes them, and removes them from the logger.\n- The `finally` block is used to ensure that `close` is called even if an exception occurs.\n- Make sure to use `input()` instead of `raw_input()` if you're using Python 3."
