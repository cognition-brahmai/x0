The output returned indicates that it's not getting stuck on the same iteration. Is there a way to attach my script to a debugger only when it gets locked? I am open to using other debuggers if necessary."

        "content": "Debugging deadlocks can indeed be quite tricky, especially when the issue doesn't occur consistently. However, there are a few strategies you can employ to diagnose and potentially fix deadlocks in Python:\n\n1. **Using `faulthandler`:** Python's `faulthandler` module can be a useful tool for diagnosing deadlocks. It can help you print stack traces of all threads on a signal, which can be invaluable in identifying where the deadlock is occurring.\n\n   ```python\n   import faulthandler\n   import signal\n\n   faulthandler.register(signal.SIGUSR1)\n   ```\n\n   You can then send a `SIGUSR1` signal to the process when you suspect a deadlock. This will print the stack traces, allowing you to see where each thread is stuck.\n\n2. **Using a Watchdog Timer:** You can implement a watchdog timer that will trigger if a certain block of code takes too long to execute. This can help you pinpoint where the deadlock might be occurring.\n\n   ```python\n   import threading\n\n   def watchdog(timeout, callback):\n       def wrapper():\n           threading.Timer(timeout, callback).start()\n\n       return wrapper\n\n   def my_callback():\n       print(\"Potential deadlock detected!\")\n\n   @watchdog(5, my_callback)  # Set timeout as needed\n   def my_function():\n       # Your code here\n   ```\n\n3. **Thread Dumps with `gdb`:** If you're comfortable using `gdb`, you can attach it to a running Python process to get a thread dump. This is more advanced but can provide detailed insight into what's happening in the program.\n\n   ```bash\n   gdb -p <PID>\n   ```\n\n   Once in `gdb`, you can use the `thread apply all bt` command to get a backtrace for all threads.\n\n4. **Using `py-spy`:** `py-spy` is a sampling profiler for Python programs that can also be used to get stack traces without stopping the program. It can be very useful for diagnosing performance issues and deadlocks.\n\n   ```bash\n   py-spy dump -p <PID>\n   ```\n\n5. **Log Statements:** Sometimes, simply adding more logging can help you identify where the program is getting stuck. Print statements or using a logging framework to output the status before and after critical sections can help you determine where the deadlock occurs.\n\n6. **Review the Code for Deadlock Patterns:** Look for common deadlock patterns, such as circular wait conditions with locks or resources being held for too long. Ensure that locks are always acquired in a consistent order.\n\nBy combining these techniques, you should be able to identify and resolve the deadlock issue in your Python script."
