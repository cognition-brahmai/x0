However, I'm not sure how to achieve these same features in Python, particularly in terms of creating a package for deployment. Is there an equivalent tool or method in Python, specifically for Python 2.x, that I can use?"

        "content": "In Python, the equivalent of Maven for dependency management and build automation is typically achieved using a combination of tools, even for Python 2.x. The primary tools you might consider are:\n\n1. **Setuptools and Distutils**: These are the standard libraries used for packaging Python projects. They allow you to specify dependencies in a `setup.py` file, similar to a `pom.xml` in Maven.\n\n   - Create a `setup.py` file in the root of your project. This file will define your package, its dependencies, and other metadata.\n\n     ```python\n     from setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\n     setup(\n         name='YourPackageName',\n         version='1.0.0',\n         packages=find_packages(),\n         install_requires=[\n             'dependency1',\n             'dependency2',\n         ],\n     )\n     ```\n\n   - You can use the command `python setup.py install` to install the package along with its dependencies.\n\n2. **pip**: This is the package installer for Python. For managing dependencies, you can create a `requirements.txt` file listing all the dependencies your project needs. You can then install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\n\n3. **virtualenv**: This is a tool to create isolated Python environments. It is particularly useful when working with Python 2.x to avoid conflicts between project dependencies.\n\n   - You can create a virtual environment using `virtualenv <env_name>` and activate it using `source <env_name>/bin/activate` on Unix or `<env_name>\\Scripts\\activate` on Windows.\n\n4. **Wheel**: This is a built-package format for Python. You can create a wheel file using `python setup.py bdist_wheel`, which can then be distributed and installed using pip.\n\n5. **Buildout**: Another tool that was popular for managing project builds and dependencies in Python 2.x. It is more complex than setuptools but offers more control and customization.\n\nWhile many of these tools are available in Python 2.x, it's worth noting that Python 2 has reached the end of its life, and it's recommended to migrate to Python 3.x for better support and features. Many modern tools and libraries are focusing on Python 3.x, which offers improved functionality and security."
