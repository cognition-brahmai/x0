The \"signup_date\" field stores the date when the customer signed up. \nCan you provide an SQL query to select the customers who have signed up within the last 7 days? \nFor example, if today is 2021-09-01, the query should return all customers who signed up between 2021-08-25 and 2021-09-01."

This query assumes you are using a database system that supports the `CURRENT_DATE` function, like PostgreSQL or MySQL:\n\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, email, signup_date\nFROM customers\nWHERE signup_date BETWEEN CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days' AND CURRENT_DATE;\n```\n\nIf you are using MySQL, you might prefer to use the `DATE_SUB` function:\n\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, email, signup_date\nFROM customers\nWHERE signup_date BETWEEN DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 7 DAY) AND CURRENT_DATE;\n```\n\nFor SQL Server, you would use the `GETDATE()` function and `DATEADD` like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, email, signup_date\nFROM customers\nWHERE signup_date BETWEEN DATEADD(DAY, -7, CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE)) AND CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE);\n```\n\nEach of these queries will return customers who signed up within the last 7 days, including today. Adjust the function used for the current date based on the SQL dialect you are using."
