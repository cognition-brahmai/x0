        "content": "To achieve the task of reversing the words in a sentence while maintaining proper grammar and punctuation, we can create a Python function that will handle this operation. We'll take the example sentence \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog\" and reverse the order of the words.\n\nHere's a Python function to perform this operation:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_sentence(sentence):\n    # Split the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n    \n    # Reverse the order of the words\n    reversed_words = words[::-1]\n    \n    # Capitalize the first word and lowercase the last word if needed\n    reversed_words[0] = reversed_words[0].capitalize()\n    reversed_words[-1] = reversed_words[-1].lower()\n    \n    # Join the reversed words into a new sentence\n    reversed_sentence = ' '.join(reversed_words)\n    \n    return reversed_sentence\n\n# Example usage\nexample_sentence = \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog\"\nresult = reverse_sentence(example_sentence)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Splitting**: The function splits the input sentence into a list of words using the `split()` method.\n2. **Reversing**: The list of words is then reversed using Python's list slicing technique `[::-1]`.\n3. **Capitalization**: To ensure proper grammar, the first word of the reversed sentence is capitalized, and the last word is converted to lowercase.\n4. **Joining**: The reversed list of words is joined back into a single string to form the final sentence.\n5. **Output**: The function returns the grammatically correct reversed sentence.\n\nWhen you run this function with the example sentence, it will output: \"Dog lazy the over jumped fox brown quick the\"."
