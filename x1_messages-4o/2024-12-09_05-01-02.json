This function is designed to copy both the file content and its metadata, including timestamps.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use `shutil.copy2`:\n\n```python\nimport shutil\n\n# Source file path\nsrc = 'path/to/source/file'\n\n# Destination file path\ndst = 'path/to/destination/file'\n\n# Copy the file while preserving metadata\nshutil.copy2(src, dst)\n```\n\nThis will ensure that the file's metadata, such as the modification and access times, are preserved in the destination file. Note that on some operating systems, the creation date might not be preserved due to the limitations of the file system or the operating system itself. However, `shutil.copy2` is the best option available in Python's standard library for preserving as much metadata as possible."
