I want to create a mechanism to make the application extensible by the users, essentially a scripting or plugin architecture. The key requirement is that it should be extremely lightweight. The majority of the scripts or plugins are not intended for third-party development or distribution, but rather for users to quickly automate recurring tasks, add support for a new file format, etc. Consequently, the plugins should have the least amount of boilerplate code and not require any 'installation' besides being copied into a directory. I am not interested in setuptools entry points or the Zope plugin architecture as they seem too complex. Are there any pre-existing systems or projects with similar schemes that I can use as references or sources of inspiration?"

        "content": "For your use case, a lightweight and flexible approach can be implemented using a simple plugin architecture with Python's native capabilities. Here are some ideas and existing systems you might find useful as references or inspiration:\n\n1. **Python's `importlib` Module:**\n   - You can leverage Python's `importlib` to dynamically load and execute user scripts or plugins. By placing user scripts in a specific directory, your application can scan this directory and import any available scripts as modules.\n\n2. **Simple Plugin System:**\n   - Create a directory for plugins, and require each plugin to define a specific function or class that your application can call. For example, each plugin module might need to have a `run()` function or a class that implements a specific interface.\n\n3. **Use of Decorators:**\n   - Utilize decorators to register plugins. For instance, have a `@plugin` decorator that registers a function or class in a global registry when the module is imported.\n\n4. **Example Projects:**\n   - **Flask Extensions:** Flask is a lightweight web framework that uses a simple mechanism for extensions. You can look at how Flask loads extensions using its `find_packages` and `import_string` utilities.\n   - **Jupyter Notebook Extensions:** Jupyter has a straightforward mechanism for loading extensions that modify its behavior; reviewing its architecture might offer insights into managing user scripts.\n   - **Sublime Text Plugins:** Sublime Text allows users to write simple plugins in Python. Their plugin system is minimalistic and easy to understand, focusing on placing scripts in a specific directory and using hooks.\n\n5. **Configuration Files:**\n   - Allow users to define metadata or configuration in a simple file format like JSON or YAML, which your application can read to understand what plugins are available and how they should be used.\n\n6. **Command-line Interface (CLI) Integration:**\n   - If your application is CLI-based, consider allowing users to write scripts that your application can execute with specific command-line arguments, simplifying integration.\n\nHere's a simple example to get you started:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport importlib.util\n\nPLUGIN_DIRECTORY = 'plugins'\n\ndef load_plugins():\n    plugins = {}\n    for filename in os.listdir(PLUGIN_DIRECTORY):\n        if filename.endswith('.py'):\n            module_name = filename[:-3]\n            file_path = os.path.join(PLUGIN_DIRECTORY, filename)\n\n            spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(module_name, file_path)\n            module = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)\n            spec.loader.exec_module(module)\n\n            if hasattr(module, 'run'):\n                plugins[module_name] = module.run\n    return plugins\n\n# Usage\nplugins = load_plugins()\nfor name, plugin in plugins.items():\n    print(f\"Running plugin: {name}\")\n    plugin()\n```\n\nThis example assumes each plugin has a `run()` function. Users can simply drop their scripts into the `plugins` directory, and your application will find and execute them. Adjust the specifics as needed to fit your application's architecture and user needs."
