I am facing an issue with the current solutions which seem to replace the streams entirely, rather than redirecting them. This causes a problem if a method has a local copy of one of the variables for a specific reason such as the stream being passed as a parameter to something. Is there a solution for this?"

        "content": "Yes, you can temporarily redirect `stdout` and `stderr` during the execution of a method in Python. One effective way to achieve this is by using the `contextlib` module, which provides utilities for common tasks involving the `with` statement. Specifically, you can make use of `contextlib.redirect_stdout` and `contextlib.redirect_stderr`.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\nfrom contextlib import redirect_stdout, redirect_stderr\n\ndef my_function():\n    print(\"This will be captured\")\n\ndef capture_output(func):\n    # Create StringIO objects to capture the outputs\n    stdout_capture = io.StringIO()\n    stderr_capture = io.StringIO()\n    \n    with redirect_stdout(stdout_capture), redirect_stderr(stderr_capture):\n        func()\n    \n    # Get the contents of the streams\n    stdout_content = stdout_capture.getvalue()\n    stderr_content = stderr_capture.getvalue()\n    \n    return stdout_content, stderr_content\n\n# Usage\nstdout_result, stderr_result = capture_output(my_function)\nprint(\"Captured stdout:\", stdout_result)\nprint(\"Captured stderr:\", stderr_result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **StringIO Objects**: We create `StringIO` objects to capture the output from `stdout` and `stderr`.\n\n2. **Context Managers**: We use `redirect_stdout` and `redirect_stderr` as context managers within a `with` statement. This temporarily redirects the output to the `StringIO` objects during the execution of the code block.\n\n3. **Function Execution**: The function `func()` is called within the `with` block, and any output it generates is captured.\n\n4. **Retrieve Output**: After exiting the `with` block, the captured outputs are retrieved using the `getvalue()` method on the `StringIO` objects.\n\nThis approach ensures that the redirection is limited to the scope of the `with` block, preserving the original streams elsewhere in the program."
