        "content": "Your Scala code correctly calculates the product of 104 and 40. Let's break down the logic and confirm that everything aligns with the problem statement:\n\n1. **Prime Factors of 104:**\n   - 104 is indeed a composite number. It's factors include: \\( 1, 2, 4, 8, 13, 26, 52, \\) and \\( 104 \\).\n   - The prime factors of 104 are \\( 2 \\) and \\( 13 \\), which you have correctly identified.\n\n2. **Factors of 40:**\n   - 40 is a composite number and a multiple of 10.\n   - The factors of 40 include: \\( 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40 \\).\n   - You mentioned some composite factors \\( 2, 4, 5, 10, 20 \\) (excluding 1 and itself), which are part of the factor set of 40.\n\n3. **Product Calculation:**\n   - You have calculated the product of 104 and 40 with the expression `val product = num1 * num2`, which is correct.\n\nYour Scala code looks good, and it will correctly print the product of 104 and 40:\n\n```scala\nval num1 = 104\nval num2 = 40\nval primeFactors = Seq(2, 13) // prime factors of 104\nval compositeFactors = Seq(2, 4, 5, 10, 20) // factors of 40 excluding 1 and itself\nval product = num1 * num2\nprintln(s\"The product of $num1 and $num2 is $product\")\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\nThe product of 104 and 40 is 4160\n```\n\nThis confirms that your code is accurate and aligns with the given conditions."
