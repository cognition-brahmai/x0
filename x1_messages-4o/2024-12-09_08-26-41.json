I'm testing a complex JavaScript interface and have several buttons in the form of `<div>My Button</div>`. I want to be able to search for these buttons based on the text they contain, such as \"My Button\", \"my button\", or \"button\". I'm currently using `driver.find_elements_by_xpath('//div[contains(text(), \"' + text + '\")]` but this is case-sensitive. I have also tried iterating through all the divs on the page and checking the element.text property, but this includes the text of child elements and I can't figure out how to exclude them. Moreover, this approach is very slow in the Chrome webdriver. Do you have any suggestions on how I can improve my search?"

        "content": "To find elements containing specific text in Selenium WebDriver using Python while addressing the issues of case sensitivity and performance, you can use XPath with a combination of functions to handle case insensitivity. Here's an improved approach:\n\n1. **Use XPath with `translate()` for Case Insensitivity**:\n   You can use the `translate()` function in XPath to convert both the text in the elements and the search text to lowercase (or uppercase) for a case-insensitive search.\n\n2. **Avoid Iterating Manually**:\n   Instead of iterating through all elements manually, let XPath handle the filtering for you, which is generally faster.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom selenium import webdriver\n\n# Initialize the WebDriver\ndriver = webdriver.Chrome()\n\n# Open your target web page\ndriver.get('https://example.com')\n\n# Define the search text\nsearch_text = \"my button\"\n\n# Convert the search text to lowercase\nlower_search_text = search_text.lower()\n\n# Find elements using XPath with translate() for case-insensitive search\nelements = driver.find_elements_by_xpath(\n    f\"//div[contains(translate(text(), 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'), '{lower_search_text}')]\"\n)\n\n# Iterate over found elements and print their text\nfor element in elements:\n    print(element.text)\n\n# Close the WebDriver\ndriver.quit()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`translate()` Function**: This function is used to convert the text content of each `div` and the search text to lowercase. This makes the search case-insensitive.\n  \n- **XPath Expression**: The XPath expression used here finds `div` elements where the lowercase text content contains the lowercase version of your search text.\n\n### Note:\n- **Performance**: This approach should be more efficient than iterating over all elements manually, as the XPath engine handles the filtering.\n  \n- **WebDriver Compatibility**: Ensure your WebDriver and browser versions are compatible and up-to-date to avoid any issues.\n\nBy using this method, you can effectively search for elements based on text in a case-insensitive manner without the need to manually process each element."
