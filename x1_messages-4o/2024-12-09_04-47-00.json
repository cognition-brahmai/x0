For instance, if I have a list named 'verts' and I want to find the first and last index of the value '12.345', can I use methods like 'verts.IndexOf(12.345)' and 'verts.LastIndexOf(12.345)'?"

        "content": "In Python, lists do not have built-in methods like `IndexOf` or `LastIndexOf` as you might find in some other programming languages. However, you can achieve this functionality using Python's list methods and some simple code.\n\nTo find the first index of a specific value in a list, you can use the `list.index()` method. This method returns the first occurrence of the specified value. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nverts = [10, 20, 12.345, 40, 12.345, 50]\nfirst_index = verts.index(12.345)\nprint(\"First index:\", first_index)\n```\n\nTo find the last index of a specific value, you can use a combination of the `list.index()` method and list slicing, or simply iterate over the list in reverse. Here's one way to do it:\n\n```python\nlast_index = len(verts) - 1 - verts[::-1].index(12.345)\nprint(\"Last index:\", last_index)\n```\n\nAlternatively, you could iterate over the list to find the last occurrence:\n\n```python\nlast_index = -1\nfor i, value in enumerate(verts):\n    if value == 12.345:\n        last_index = i\n\nprint(\"Last index:\", last_index)\n```\n\nThese methods will give you the first and last indices of the specified value in the list."
