The probability of getting 35 heads in a coin toss of 50 coins can be calculated using the binomial distribution formula:\nP(X=35) = (50 choose 35) * (0.5)^35 * (0.5)^(50-35)\nwhere \"choose\" represents the binomial coefficient, which can be calculated as:\n(50 choose 35) = 50! / (35! * (50-35)!)\nUsing a calculator, we can simplify this expression to get:\nP(X=35) = 0.02844\nTherefore, the probability of getting exactly 35 heads in a coin toss of 50 coins is approximately 0.02844 or 2.84%."

        "content": "Your calculation of the probability of getting exactly 35 heads in 50 coin tosses using the binomial distribution is correct. Let's break it down again for clarity:\n\n1. **Binomial Distribution Formula:**\n   \\[\n   P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} \\cdot p^k \\cdot (1-p)^{n-k}\n   \\]\n   where:\n   - \\( n \\) is the total number of trials (50 in this case),\n   - \\( k \\) is the number of successful trials (35 heads),\n   - \\( p \\) is the probability of success on a single trial (0.5 for a fair coin).\n\n2. **Binomial Coefficient:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{50}{35} = \\frac{50!}{35! \\cdot 15!}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Probability Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   P(X = 35) = \\binom{50}{35} \\cdot (0.5)^{35} \\cdot (0.5)^{15}\n   \\]\n\nUpon calculating this, you correctly found that the probability is approximately 0.02844, which means there's about a 2.84% chance of getting exactly 35 heads in 50 tosses of a fair coin. This demonstrates how the binomial distribution can be used to find probabilities for specific outcomes in repeated independent trials."
