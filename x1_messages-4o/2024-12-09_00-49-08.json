I have a NumPy array with the shape (100, 170, 256) and an array consisting of indexes [0, 10, 20, 40, 70]. I tried getting the sub-array not corresponding to those indexes using `sub_array = array[..., ~index]` and `sub_array = array[..., not(index.any)]` but both still return an array of shape (100, 170, 5). What is the correct way to perform this complement operation?"

        "content": "To access elements of a NumPy array that are not in a given index list, you need to use boolean indexing or create a mask that represents the indices you want to exclude. In your case, you have an array of shape (100, 170, 256) and you want to exclude certain indices along the last axis.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. Create a full range of indices for the last axis.\n2. Use NumPy's `np.isin()` function to create a boolean mask that is `True` for the indices you want to exclude.\n3. Use this mask to select the elements you want to keep.\n\nHere's a step-by-step implementation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Example array and indices to exclude\narray = np.random.rand(100, 170, 256)\nindices_to_exclude = np.array([0, 10, 20, 40, 70])\n\n# Create a range of all possible indices along the last axis\nall_indices = np.arange(array.shape[-1])\n\n# Create a boolean mask for indices to keep\nmask = ~np.isin(all_indices, indices_to_exclude)\n\n# Use the mask to select the desired sub-array\nsub_array = array[..., mask]\n\n# Verify the shape of the resulting sub-array\nprint(sub_array.shape)  # Expected shape: (100, 170, 251)\n```\n\nIn this code, `np.isin(all_indices, indices_to_exclude)` generates a boolean array where `True` corresponds to the indices that are in `indices_to_exclude`. By negating this with `~`, we get `True` for the indices we want to keep. This boolean mask is then used to filter the original array along the last axis."
