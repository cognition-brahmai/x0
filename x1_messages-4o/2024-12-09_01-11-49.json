Specifically, I want to generate a list like `[f(0), g(0), f(1), g(1), ..., f(n-1), g(n-1)]` for any given range `n`. I am looking for a list comprehension that can replace the following block of code:\n\n```python\nresult = list()\nfor x in range(n):\n    result.add(f(x))\n    result.add(g(x))\n```"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this using a list comprehension by nesting the function calls within the comprehension. You can iterate over each item in the range and then iterate over the functions you want to apply, collecting the results in a flat list. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nresult = [func(x) for x in range(n) for func in (f, g)]\n```\n\nIn this list comprehension:\n\n- The outer loop iterates over each `x` in the given range `n`.\n- The inner loop iterates over the functions `f` and `g` in a tuple `(f, g)`.\n- For each combination of `x` and function, it applies the function to `x` and adds the result to the list.\n\nThis approach will generate a list with elements `[f(0), g(0), f(1), g(1), ..., f(n-1), g(n-1)]` as you wanted."
