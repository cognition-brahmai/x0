        "content": "I am currently experimenting with file lookups in Python on a large hard disk. I have been using os.walk and glob, and I usually prefer os.walk as it seems quicker and neater for typical size directories. I have noticed that glob appears to be slower, but allows the use of wildcards, while with os.walk, you need to filter results. For instance, when looking up core dumps, I use the following scripts:\n\nWith os.walk:\n\n```python\ncore = re.compile(r\"core\\.\\d*\")\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(\"/path/to/dir/\"):\n    for file in files:\n        if core.search(file):\n            path = os.path.join(root,file)\n            print \"Deleting: \" + path\n            os.remove(path)\n```\n\nWith glob (iglob):\n\n```python\nfor file in iglob(\"/path/to/dir/core.*\"):\n    print \"Deleting: \" + file\n    os.remove(file)\n```\n\nDoes anyone have experience with both os.walk and glob and can provide insight into which is more efficient?"

        "content": "When comparing `os.walk` and `glob` in Python, it's important to consider the specific use case and the directory structure you are working with. Both methods have their pros and cons.\n\n### Efficiency Considerations:\n\n1. **os.walk**:\n   - **Pros**:\n     - Allows you to traverse the directory tree recursively, providing access to directories and files at each level.\n     - Typically faster for deeply nested directory structures because it processes one directory at a time.\n     - More control over filtering because you can apply any condition or regex to files at each directory level.\n   - **Cons**:\n     - You have to manually filter files, which can add complexity to your code.\n\n2. **glob** (specifically `iglob`):\n   - **Pros**:\n     - Provides a simpler syntax for pattern matching using wildcards.\n     - Useful for flat directory structures where you want to match patterns directly without the need for recursive traversal.\n   - **Cons**:\n     - May perform slower on large and deeply nested directories because it evaluates all files matching the pattern across the entire directory structure.\n     - Does not provide a direct way to traverse directories; it only matches paths based on patterns.\n\n### Performance Tips:\n\n- **Directory Structure**: If your directory structure is deeply nested, `os.walk` might be more efficient because it processes directories incrementally.\n- **Pattern Matching**: If you have a flat directory structure or your pattern matching requirements are simple, `glob` can be more concise.\n- **Hybrid Approach**: Sometimes combining both can be effective. Use `os.walk` to traverse directories and apply `fnmatch` or regex for pattern matching on filenames.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nFor your specific use case of finding and deleting core dump files, if the directory structure is not too complex and performance is critical, stick with `os.walk` as it provides more control and may perform better in deeply nested directories. However, if you prefer simplicity and are working with a flat structure, `glob` can be a more straightforward solution.\n\nUltimately, you can profile both methods on your specific dataset to see which performs better in your environment. Use Python's `time` module or other profiling tools to measure the execution time of both scripts."
