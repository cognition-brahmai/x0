        "content": "In Python, docstrings are used to document modules, classes, methods, and functions. There are several common formats and conventions for writing docstrings, each with its own style and structure. The most popular ones include:\n\n1. **PEP 257**: This is the Python Enhancement Proposal that provides conventions for writing docstrings. It suggests that docstrings should be enclosed in triple quotes and should describe the module, class, or function's purpose. The first line should be a short summary, and any additional details can follow after a blank line.\n\n2. **reStructuredText (reST)**: This is a lightweight markup language used by the Sphinx documentation generator. It allows for more complex formatting, such as headings, lists, and links, making it suitable for larger projects.\n\n   Example:\n   ```python\n   def example_function(param1, param2):\n       \"\"\"\n       Summary of the function.\n\n       :param param1: Description of param1\n       :type param1: int\n       :param param2: Description of param2\n       :type param2: str\n       :return: Description of return value\n       :rtype: bool\n       \"\"\"\n       pass\n   ```\n\n3. **Google Style**: This is a simple and clean format that is easily readable. It uses specific sections for arguments, returns, and exceptions.\n\n   Example:\n   ```python\n   def example_function(param1, param2):\n       \"\"\"\n       Summary of the function.\n\n       Args:\n           param1 (int): Description of param1.\n           param2 (str): Description of param2.\n\n       Returns:\n           bool: Description of return value.\n       \"\"\"\n       pass\n   ```\n\n4. **NumPy/SciPy Style**: This format is used extensively in the scientific computing community. It is similar to the Google style but with more detailed sections.\n\n   Example:\n   ```python\n   def example_function(param1, param2):\n       \"\"\"\n       Summary of the function.\n\n       Parameters\n       ----------\n       param1 : int\n           Description of param1.\n       param2 : str\n           Description of param2.\n\n       Returns\n       -------\n       bool\n           Description of return value.\n       \"\"\"\n       pass\n   ```\n\nEach of these styles has its own set of advantages, and the choice of which to use often depends on personal or project preferences. Consistency within a project is key, so once a style is chosen, it should be adhered to throughout the codebase."
