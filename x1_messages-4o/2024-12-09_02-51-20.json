        "content": "The error message you're encountering is due to a mismatch between the version of TensorFlow you're trying to install and the version of Python you have. The wheel file `tensorflow_gpu-1.0.0rc2-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl` is intended for Python 3.5, not Python 3.6. Here's how you can resolve this issue and successfully install TensorFlow with Anaconda for Python 3.6:\n\n1. **Create a New Conda Environment**: It's a good practice to create a new environment specifically for your TensorFlow installation to avoid package conflicts. You can do this by opening Anaconda Prompt and typing:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda create -n tensorflow_env python=3.6\n   ```\n\n   This will create a new environment named `tensorflow_env` with Python 3.6.\n\n2. **Activate the Environment**:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda activate tensorflow_env\n   ```\n\n3. **Install TensorFlow**: Use the `conda` or `pip` command to install a compatible version of TensorFlow. You can choose between the CPU or GPU version depending on your hardware configuration. For the CPU version, you can use:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda install tensorflow\n   ```\n\n   For the GPU version, ensure you have the necessary NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit installed, and use:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda install tensorflow-gpu\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify the Installation**: After installation, you can verify that TensorFlow is installed correctly by running a simple Python script:\n\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n   print(tf.__version__)\n   ```\n\n   This should display the version of TensorFlow you installed, indicating that the installation was successful.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and have TensorFlow installed and running in your Anaconda environment with Python 3.6."
