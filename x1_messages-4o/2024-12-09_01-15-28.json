I was trying to catch AWS exceptions using the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom aws_utils import make_session\n\nsession = make_session()\ncf = session.resource(\"iam\")\nrole = cf.Role(\"foo\")\ntry:\n    role.load()\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(type(e))\n    raise e\n```\n\nThe error returned is of type `botocore.errorfactory.NoSuchEntityException`. However, when I attempt to import this exception, I get an ImportError: `No module named NoSuchEntityException`. I found a workaround where I catch the specific error like this:\n\n```python\nfrom botocore.exceptions import ClientError\nsession = make_session()\ncf = session.resource(\"iam\")\nrole = cf.Role(\"foo\")\ntry:\n    role.load()\nexcept ClientError as e:\n    if e.response[\"Error\"][\"Code\"] == \"NoSuchEntity\":\n        # ignore the target exception\n        pass\n    else:\n        # this is not the exception we are looking for\n        raise e\n```\n\nBut this approach seems very \"hackish\". Is there a better way to handle this?"

        "content": "When working with boto3 and botocore, handling specific exceptions can be a bit tricky due to how exceptions are dynamically generated. The `NoSuchEntityException` and similar exceptions are not directly importable because they are created at runtime by botocore's error factory.\n\nThe approach you have taken\u2014catching a `ClientError` and then checking the error code\u2014is indeed the recommended way to handle specific AWS exceptions. While it might feel \"hackish,\" it's the standard practice when working with boto3, since these exceptions are not directly accessible through imports.\n\nHere's a refined version of your approach, which can make it feel cleaner and more structured:\n\n```python\nfrom botocore.exceptions import ClientError\nfrom aws_utils import make_session\n\ndef handle_role_load(role_name):\n    session = make_session()\n    iam = session.resource(\"iam\")\n    role = iam.Role(role_name)\n    \n    try:\n        role.load()\n    except ClientError as e:\n        error_code = e.response.get(\"Error\", {}).get(\"Code\")\n        \n        if error_code == \"NoSuchEntity\":\n            print(f\"Role '{role_name}' does not exist.\")\n            # Handle the specific case where the role does not exist\n        else:\n            # Re-raise the exception if it's not the one you're looking for\n            raise\n\n# Example usage\nhandle_role_load(\"foo\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Error Code Checking**: Since specific AWS exceptions like `NoSuchEntityException` are not directly importable, checking the error code is a reliable way to handle specific errors.\n\n2. **Exception Handling Structure**: Wrapping exception handling in a function can help keep your code organized and make it reusable.\n\n3. **Logging**: Consider adding logging to help with debugging and monitoring, especially in production environments.\n\n4. **Documentation**: The AWS SDK documentation is a valuable resource for understanding which error codes may be returned by different services and operations.\n\nWhile it might seem indirect, this pattern is widely used and ensures that your code can handle AWS-specific exceptions robustly."
