For instance, if I have a numpy array as follows:\n\n```python\nA = numpy.array([0,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90])\n```\n\nThen the size 5 neighbourhood of element 4 is `[20,30,40,50,60]`, which I can easily get by doing `A[i-2:i+3]`. However, I want to get the neighbourhoods to \"wrap around\" the edges of the array, so that the neighbourhood of the element 0 is `[80,90,0,10,20]` and the neighbourhood of the element 9 is `[70,80,90,0,10]`. I've been struggling to find a concise way to achieve this. Additionaly, in the case of a 2D array, the neighbourhood of a point would be a rectangular array. Is there any efficient way to express this \"wrap-around neighbourhood\" operation in numpy? I would prefer a solution that returns a slice rather than a copy, prioritizing readability and speed."

        "content": "To achieve a \"wrap-around neighbourhood\" in a 1D numpy array, you can use the modulus operation to handle the wrapping logic efficiently. This approach works by adjusting the indices using the modulus of the array's length, ensuring that the indices wrap around when they go out of bounds. Here's how you can implement this for a 1D array:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef wrap_around_neighbourhood_1d(arr, index, size):\n    n = len(arr)\n    half_size = size // 2\n    indices = [(index + i - half_size) % n for i in range(size)]\n    return arr[indices]\n\n# Example usage\nA = np.array([0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90])\nneighbourhood = wrap_around_neighbourhood_1d(A, 0, 5)\nprint(neighbourhood)  # Output: [80, 90, 0, 10, 20]\n```\n\nFor a 2D array, you would need to implement a similar approach, but you would handle the wrapping for both dimensions separately. Here's a function that does that for a rectangular neighbourhood:\n\n```python\ndef wrap_around_neighbourhood_2d(arr, x, y, width, height):\n    rows, cols = arr.shape\n    half_width = width // 2\n    half_height = height // 2\n\n    row_indices = [(x + i - half_height) % rows for i in range(height)]\n    col_indices = [(y + j - half_width) % cols for j in range(width)]\n\n    return arr[np.ix_(row_indices, col_indices)]\n\n# Example usage\nB = np.array([[0, 1, 2, 3],\n              [4, 5, 6, 7],\n              [8, 9, 10, 11],\n              [12, 13, 14, 15]])\nneighbourhood_2d = wrap_around_neighbourhood_2d(B, 0, 0, 3, 3)\nprint(neighbourhood_2d)\n# Output:\n# [[15, 12, 13],\n#  [ 3,  0,  1],\n#  [ 7,  4,  5]]\n```\n\nThis approach uses list comprehensions to generate the wrapped-around indices, and `np.ix_` to index the 2D array, ensuring that the operation is efficient and readable."
