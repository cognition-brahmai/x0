I have been making copies and extending from them instead of directly extending from the admin templates. This is effective but results in confusion and extra work when the admin templates change. Is there an existing solution for this problem that doesn't require me to create a custom extend-tag for the templates? Also, is there any information on whether this issue will be addressed by Django itself?"

        "content": "Overriding and extending Django admin templates can be a bit tricky, especially when you want to keep up with changes in the admin templates with minimal effort. Fortunately, there are some best practices and strategies you can adopt to streamline this process:\n\n1. **Override Templates Directly:**\n   You can override any admin template by creating a file with the same name and directory structure in your project\u2019s templates directory. For example, to override `admin/index.html`, create a file at `your_project/templates/admin/index.html`. This way, Django will use your custom template instead of the default one.\n\n2. **Extend Default Templates:**\n   Instead of copying the entire template, extend the default admin template. If you use the `{% extends 'admin/index.html' %}` tag, Django will extend the default template. You can then override specific blocks within that template. This approach reduces the amount of duplicated code and makes updates easier.\n\n3. **Use `app_dirs` Loader:**\n   It seems you\u2019re already using the `app_directories` template loader, which is a good start. This loader allows Django to find templates in each installed app\u2019s `templates` directory.\n\n4. **Custom Template Tags or Filters:**\n   If you find yourself repeating certain logic or content in your extended templates, consider creating custom template tags or filters to encapsulate that logic. This makes your templates cleaner and easier to manage.\n\n5. **Stay Updated with Django Releases:**\n   Keep an eye on Django\u2019s release notes and documentation. While there is no specific feature in Django dedicated to making admin template overrides easier, staying updated will help you anticipate and manage changes in default admin templates.\n\n6. **Django Custom Admin Apps:**\n   For more advanced customizations, consider creating your own admin app. This allows for greater flexibility and control over the admin interface.\n\nBy following these practices, you can manage admin template customizations more effectively. Unfortunately, there is no built-in Django feature specifically designed to address this issue comprehensively. However, the community often shares best practices and tools that can help streamline the process, so checking community forums and resources can also provide useful insights."
