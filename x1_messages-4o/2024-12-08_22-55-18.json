        "content": "To incorporate a plot generated by Python and Matplotlib into a LaTeX document, you'll need to save the plot as an image file and then include it in your LaTeX document. You can use the `pgfplots` package for plotting directly within LaTeX, or simply include images using the `graphicx` package.\n\nBelow is an example of how you can do this:\n\n### Step 1: Save the Plot as an Image\n\nModify your Python code to save the plot as an image file, such as a PNG file:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Generate data\nx = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)\ny = np.sin(x)\n\n# Create the plot\nplt.plot(x, y)\n\n# Save the plot as a PNG file\nplt.savefig('sine_wave.png')\n```\n\n### Step 2: Create a LaTeX Document\n\nCreate a LaTeX document that includes both mathematical equations and the saved plot:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{amsmath} % For mathematical equations\n\\usepackage{graphicx} % For including images\n\\usepackage{geometry} % To adjust the page margins\n\n\\geometry{a4paper, margin=1in}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\title{Mathematical Equations and Plots}\n\\author{Your Name}\n\\date{\\today}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nThis document contains a mathematical equation and a plot generated using Python and Matplotlib.\n\n\\section{Mathematical Equation}\n\nHere is an example of a simple mathematical equation:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nE = mc^2\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\section{Plot}\n\nBelow is a plot of the function \\( y = \\sin(x) \\):\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{sine_wave.png}\n    \\caption{Plot of \\( y = \\sin(x) \\)}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Compile the LaTeX Document\n\n1. Save your LaTeX code in a file with a `.tex` extension, for example, `document.tex`.\n2. Ensure that the image file `sine_wave.png` is in the same directory as your `.tex` file.\n3. Use a LaTeX editor like TeXShop, TeXworks, or an online editor like Overleaf to compile your `.tex` file to a PDF. Alternatively, use command line tools such as `pdflatex`:\n\n```bash\npdflatex document.tex\n```\n\nThis process will generate a PDF document containing both the mathematical equation and the plot."
