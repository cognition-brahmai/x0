I'm currently at step 5 where I need to configure PostgreSQL to communicate with my Django application, for which I have to install psycopg2 database adapter. I tried installing the psycopg2 database adapter but I am getting a \"compilation failed\" error. The commands I used to install the psycopg2 database adapter are as follows:\n\n```\n(django_env) $ sudo apt-get install libpq-dev python3-dev\n(django_env) $ pip install psycopg2\n```\n\nThe error message I receive is:\n\n```\n(django_env1) user:/home/projects/sample_project$ sudo pip install psycopg2\nDownloading/unpacking psycopg2\n  Downloading psycopg2-2.7.3.2.tar.gz (425kB): 425kB downloaded\n  Running setup.py (path:/tmp/pip_build_root/psycopg2/setup.py) egg_info for package psycopg2\n...\n./psycopg/psycopg.h:34:20: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory\n #include <Python.h>\n                    ^\ncompilation terminated.\nerror: command 'x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc' failed with exit status 1\n...\n```\n\nI tried the solutions suggested in the following Stack Overflow questions but none of them worked: \nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/24157533/trouble-with-psycopg2-in-virtualenv-python3-for-use-with-django\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/27195490/cannot-install-psycopg2-on-virtualenv\n\nCan someone guide me on how to resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that the `Python.h` file is missing, which is usually part of the Python development headers. This typically happens when the necessary Python development packages aren't installed. To resolve this issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Ensure Python Development Headers are Installed:**\n\n   For Python 3, you should have `python3-dev` installed, but let's make sure everything is correctly installed:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install python3-dev\n   ```\n\n2. **Install pip3:**\n\n   Make sure you are using `pip3` to install packages for Python 3:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install python3-pip\n   ```\n\n3. **Install psycopg2-binary Instead:**\n\n   `psycopg2-binary` is a more straightforward alternative to `psycopg2` that doesn't require compilation:\n   ```bash\n   pip3 install psycopg2-binary\n   ```\n\n   This package should work without the need for additional system dependencies.\n\n4. **Check Virtual Environment:**\n\n   Make sure your virtual environment is activated before installing any packages:\n   ```bash\n   source /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n5. **Try Installing Again:**\n\n   Ensure that your virtual environment is activated and then try installing `psycopg2-binary` again:\n   ```bash\n   pip install psycopg2-binary\n   ```\n\n6. **Verify Installation:**\n\n   After installation, you can verify if `psycopg2` is correctly installed by opening a Python shell and attempting to import it:\n   ```python\n   import psycopg2\n   ```\n\nIf these steps don't solve the problem, it's possible there is a deeper issue with your system configuration. You might want to verify your `gcc` installation or consider reinstalling Python and its development headers."
