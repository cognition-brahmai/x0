Here is the code that I have tried:\n\n```python\nimport io\nimport csv\n\noutput = io.StringIO()\noutput.write(\"Hello!\")            # This gives a TypeError: unicode argument expected, got 'str'\noutput.write(u\"Hello!\")           # This works as expected.\nwriter = csv.writer(output)       \ncsvdata = [u\"Hello\", u\"Goodbye\"]  \nwriter.writerow(csvdata)         # This gives a TypeError: unicode argument expected, got 'str'\n```\nThe `io.StringIO()` returns an in-memory stream for Unicode text and it works correctly when I manually feed it a Unicode string. However, it fails in conjunction with the `csv` module, even if all the strings being written are Unicode strings. Where does the `str` come from that causes the Exception? I am aware that I can use `StringIO.StringIO()` instead, but I'm wondering what's wrong with `io.StringIO()` in this scenario."

        "content": "In Python 2.7, the `io.StringIO()` and the `csv` module have some compatibility issues because the `csv` module is designed to work with byte strings (`str` in Python 2) rather than Unicode strings. The `io.StringIO()` in Python 2 is used for Unicode strings, which causes the type mismatch you are encountering.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why you're seeing those errors:\n\n1. **TypeError in `csv.writer`:** The `csv` module in Python 2.7 expects byte strings, but when you use `io.StringIO()`, it expects Unicode strings. The `csv.writer` will try to encode its input to `str` using the system default encoding, which may not work correctly with a Unicode stream.\n\n2. **TypeError on writing Unicode:** When writing to `io.StringIO()`, you should always use Unicode strings. However, the `csv.writer` will try to convert its input to `str`, which is incompatible with `io.StringIO()`.\n\nTo resolve this, you can use the `StringIO.StringIO()` from the `StringIO` module, which works with byte strings. Here\u2019s how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport StringIO\nimport csv\n\noutput = StringIO.StringIO()\nwriter = csv.writer(output)\n\n# Encode your Unicode data to UTF-8, which is compatible with csv.writer\ncsvdata = [u\"Hello\".encode('utf-8'), u\"Goodbye\".encode('utf-8')]\nwriter.writerow(csvdata)\n\n# To get the result as a Unicode string, decode the output\noutput_value = output.getvalue().decode('utf-8')\nprint(output_value)\n```\n\nThis approach manually encodes Unicode data to the appropriate format before writing it with the `csv.writer`, and then decodes the result back to Unicode if you need to work with Unicode strings later in your program. This should resolve the compatibility issues and allow you to backport your code successfully."
