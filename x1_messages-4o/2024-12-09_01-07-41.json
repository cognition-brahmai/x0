For example:\n\n```python\nmodel = xgb.cv(params, dtrain,  num_boost_round=500, early_stopping_rounds=100)\n```\n\nand \n\n```python\nmodel_xgb = xgb.XGBRegressor(n_estimators=360, max_depth=2, learning_rate=0.1)\n```\n\nI understand that every time boosting is applied, a new estimator is created. If this is the case, should 'num_boost_round' and 'n_estimators' be equal? What is the difference between these two parameters?"

        "content": "The parameters `num_boost_round` and `n_estimators` in the XGBoost library both relate to the number of boosting rounds, but they are used in slightly different contexts and have subtle differences in their application. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **num_boost_round**:\n   - This parameter is used in functions like `xgb.cv` or `xgb.train`. It specifies the number of boosting rounds, which means the number of times the boosting algorithm will run to add new trees (or estimators) to the model.\n   - It's specifically tied to low-level XGBoost functions where you have greater control over the training process and can incorporate features like cross-validation and early stopping more directly.\n\n2. **n_estimators**:\n   - This parameter is used in the Scikit-learn API for XGBoost, such as `XGBRegressor` or `XGBClassifier`. It specifies the number of trees (or estimators) in the ensemble.\n   - In the Scikit-learn API, `n_estimators` is equivalent to `num_boost_round` in terms of its role in controlling the number of boosting rounds.\n\n**Should they be equal?**\n- Conceptually, they serve the same purpose; both control the number of boosting iterations. In practical terms, they should indeed be set to values that reflect the same intent in different contexts (i.e., how many boosting rounds you want to perform).\n- The primary difference is the context in which they are used: `num_boost_round` is more typical in the lower-level API, while `n_estimators` is part of the higher-level Scikit-learn interface.\n\n**When to use which?**\n- Use `num_boost_round` when you are working directly with the XGBoost DMatrix API and want more granular control over the training process, possibly with cross-validation strategies.\n- Use `n_estimators` when you are using the Scikit-learn compatible API, which integrates more seamlessly with the Scikit-learn ecosystem and its tools.\n\nIn summary, while they serve the same fundamental purpose, they are part of different interfaces within the XGBoost library. It's important to choose between them based on whether you're using the native XGBoost API or the Scikit-learn interface."
