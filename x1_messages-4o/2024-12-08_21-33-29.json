        "content": "In C++, a variable is considered \"null\" if it is a pointer and its value is `nullptr`. To create a conditional statement that checks if a pointer is null, you can use an `if` statement.\n\nHere's a simple example of a conditional statement checking if a pointer is null:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    int* ptr = nullptr; // This is a null pointer\n\n    if (ptr == nullptr) {\n        std::cout << \"The pointer is null.\" << std::endl;\n    } else {\n        std::cout << \"The pointer is not null.\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nNow, let's create a complex sentence with multiple relative clauses and a conditional statement:\n\n**Complex Sentence:** \n\"If the book, which is on the table, is not borrowed by the student, who is wearing a blue jacket, then the librarian, who has a red pen, will mark it as available.\"\n\nTo integrate this concept into C++ code:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n\nclass Book {\npublic:\n    std::string title;\n    bool isBorrowed;\n\n    Book(std::string t, bool b) : title(t), isBorrowed(b) {}\n};\n\nclass Student {\npublic:\n    std::string jacketColor;\n\n    Student(std::string color) : jacketColor(color) {}\n};\n\nclass Librarian {\npublic:\n    std::string penColor;\n\n    Librarian(std::string color) : penColor(color) {}\n\n    void markAvailable(Book& book) {\n        std::cout << \"The librarian, who has a \" << penColor << \" pen, marks the book \\\"\" \n                  << book.title << \"\\\" as available.\" << std::endl;\n    }\n};\n\nint main() {\n    Book book(\"C++ Programming\", false);\n    Student student(\"blue\");\n    Librarian librarian(\"red\");\n\n    if (!book.isBorrowed && student.jacketColor == \"blue\") {\n        librarian.markAvailable(book);\n    } else {\n        std::cout << \"The book is currently borrowed or other conditions are not met.\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this C++ code:\n\n1. We have a `Book` class with a `title` and a boolean `isBorrowed`.\n2. A `Student` class represents the student with a `jacketColor`.\n3. A `Librarian` class with a `penColor` and a method `markAvailable` to mark books as available.\n4. In the `main` function, we create instances of these classes.\n5. The conditional statement checks if the book is not borrowed and if the student is wearing a blue jacket. If both conditions are true, the librarian marks the book as available.\n\nThis code integrates the given complex sentence into a C++ program, demonstrating the use of relative clauses and conditional logic."
