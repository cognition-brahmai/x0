How can I get a new data frame of 30 rows and 60 columns? I tried using `pd.someSpecialMergeFunct(df1, df2)` and `pd.append(df1, df2, left_index=False, right_index=false, how='left')` but I am not sure if these are the correct ways. Also, is there a way to automatically resolve replicated column names?"

        "content": "To merge two data frames side by side, you can use the `pd.concat` function in pandas. Since both data frames have the same number of rows, you can concatenate them along the column axis (`axis=1`). Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming df1 and df2 are your data frames\ndf1 = pd.DataFrame(...)  # Data frame with 30 rows and 20 columns\ndf2 = pd.DataFrame(...)  # Data frame with 30 rows and 40 columns\n\n# Concatenating along the columns\nresult = pd.concat([df1, df2], axis=1)\n```\n\nThis will give you a new data frame with 30 rows and 60 columns.\n\nRegarding replicated column names, if both data frames have columns with the same name, `pd.concat` will automatically handle this by appending suffixes to the column names to make them unique. By default, it will add `.0`, `.1`, etc., to the column names. However, you can specify your own suffixes using the `suffixes` parameter in `pd.concat`:\n\n```python\nresult = pd.concat([df1, df2], axis=1, keys=['df1', 'df2'])\n```\n\nThis will prefix the column names with 'df1' and 'df2' to differentiate between columns from the two data frames. Alternatively, you can rename the columns before concatenation to ensure they are unique."
