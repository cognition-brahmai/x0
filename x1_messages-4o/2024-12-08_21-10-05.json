For your example, you would select the cells that contain the numbers 5, 2, 9, 1, 6, and 3.\n\n2. **Navigate to the Data Tab**: At the top of Excel, find and click on the 'Data' tab in the ribbon. This tab contains various data management tools.\n\n3. **Sort the Data**: Within the 'Data' tab, locate the 'Sort & Filter' group. Click on the 'Sort A-Z' button to sort your numbers in ascending order. This will rearrange your numbers so that the smallest number is at the top and the largest is at the bottom.\n\n4. **Verify the Sort**: After sorting, your numbers should appear in ascending order in the column. In your example, the sorted column should read 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9 from top to bottom.\n\nThis method is straightforward and efficient for sorting numbers in Excel. If you wish to sort in descending order, you can use the 'Sort Z-A' button instead."
