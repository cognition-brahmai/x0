I have attempted to do this using the following code:\n\n```python\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(html)\n\nfor hit in soup.findAll(attrs={'class' : 'MYCLASS'}):\n    print hit.text\n```\nHowever, this returns all the text between all nested tags, including the comment. How can I modify my code to only extract \"THIS IS MY TEXT\"?"

        "content": "To extract a specific text like \"THIS IS MY TEXT\" using BeautifulSoup, you need to ensure that the search is precise enough to capture only the text you want. It looks like you are currently capturing all text within elements that have the class `MYCLASS`. If \"THIS IS MY TEXT\" is within a specific tag or structure, you'll need to narrow your search. Here's a way to do this:\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\nhtml = '''<div class=\"MYCLASS\">THIS IS MY TEXT</div>'''  # Example HTML snippet\n\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')\n\n# Assuming \"THIS IS MY TEXT\" is within a tag with class \"MYCLASS\"\nfor hit in soup.find_all(attrs={'class': 'MYCLASS'}):\n    # Check if the specific text is present\n    if 'THIS IS MY TEXT' in hit.get_text():\n        # Print only the specific text\n        print('THIS IS MY TEXT')\n```\n\nThis code snippet does the following:\n1. It parses the HTML content using BeautifulSoup.\n2. It finds all elements with the class `MYCLASS`.\n3. It checks if `THIS IS MY TEXT` is in the text of each found element.\n4. It prints `THIS IS MY TEXT` if it's found.\n\nMake sure that the HTML content assigned to `html` in the example reflects your real HTML content. Adjust the search conditions if \"THIS IS MY TEXT\" is within another structure or needs specific conditions to be extracted. If this text is unique within your HTML, this approach should work."
