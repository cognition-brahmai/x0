The error I am receiving is \"ssl.SSLError: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed (_ssl.c:749)\". This error is encountered when performing operations that require accessing items through https. This includes using pip install, http.client.HTTPSConnection, and other modules or applications that utilize these internally. My Python installation was done through the official Python pkg installer, downloaded from https://python.org, which uses an internal version of openssl and does not contain root certificates. Therefore, any operation using an SSL connection results in this error. How can I install root certificates to resolve this issue?"

        "content": "To resolve the `ssl.SSLError: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED]` issue on Mac OSX, you need to ensure that your Python installation has access to the system's root certificates. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you fix this:\n\n1. **Install the `certifi` package:**\n   Python's `certifi` package contains a curated set of root certificates. You can install it using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install certifi\n   ```\n\n2. **Update the Python certificates:**\n   The Python installers for macOS from python.org come with a script that can be used to install or update root certificates. Run the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   /Applications/Python\\ 3.x/Install\\ Certificates.command\n   ```\n\n   Replace `3.x` with your specific Python version (e.g., `3.10`).\n\n3. **Modify your Python script or environment:**\n   If the above steps do not resolve the issue, you can explicitly point to the `certifi` certificate bundle in your Python script:\n\n   ```python\n   import ssl\n   import certifi\n\n   ssl_context = ssl.create_default_context(cafile=certifi.where())\n\n   # Example usage with urllib\n   import urllib.request\n\n   url = \"https://example.com\"\n   response = urllib.request.urlopen(url, context=ssl_context)\n   content = response.read()\n   ```\n\n   This approach works for libraries that allow you to pass a custom SSL context.\n\n4. **Reinstall Python with Homebrew (optional):**\n   If you're still having issues, consider installing Python via Homebrew, which uses the system's OpenSSL:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew install python\n   ```\n\n   After installation, ensure that your PATH is set to use the Homebrew Python:\n\n   ```bash\n   echo 'export PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bash_profile\n   source ~/.bash_profile\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify the installation:**\n   Once you've completed these steps, verify that your Python installation can access HTTPS sites without SSL errors by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m ssl\n   ```\n\n   This should output information about your SSL configuration, and you should not see any errors when accessing HTTPS resources.\n\nThese steps should help you resolve the SSL certificate verification issue on your Mac OSX setup."
