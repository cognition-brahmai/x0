For instance, I want to print `ab` instead of `a b` without needing to call the `print` function twice like this:\n\n```python\nprint(\"a\", end=\"\")\nprint(\"b\")\n```\n\nIn addition, I have the following code:\n\n```python\na = 42\nb = 84 \n```\n\nI want to print their values as `a = 42, b = 84`. However, when I try \n\n```python\nprint(\"a = \", a, \", \", b = \", b)\n```\n\nextra spaces are added, resulting in `a =  42 , b =  84`. Also, when I attempt to use the Java style concatenation like this:\n\n```python\nprint(\"a = \" + a + \", b = \" + b)\n```\n\nI receive a `TypeError`. How can I achieve my desired outputs in Python?"

        "content": "To print multiple values in Python without extra spaces, you can use a few different techniques. Let's address each of your requirements:\n\n### 1. Printing Characters Together without Spaces\n\nWhen you want to print characters like `ab` without spaces, you can concatenate the strings:\n\n```python\nprint(\"a\" + \"b\")\n```\n\nThis will print `ab` without any spaces.\n\n### 2. Printing Variables with a Specific Format\n\nWhen you want to print variables like `a = 42, b = 84` without extra spaces, you can use an f-string (formatted string literals), which is a more modern and convenient way to format strings in Python:\n\n```python\na = 42\nb = 84\nprint(f\"a = {a}, b = {b}\")\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `format()` method, which works in a similar way:\n\n```python\nprint(\"a = {}, b = {}\".format(a, b))\n```\n\n### Explanation for the TypeError\n\nWhen you tried to concatenate strings and integers directly using the `+` operator like this:\n\n```python\nprint(\"a = \" + a + \", b = \" + b)\n```\n\nYou received a `TypeError` because you cannot directly concatenate strings and integers. In Python, you need to convert the integers to strings first, like this:\n\n```python\nprint(\"a = \" + str(a) + \", b = \" + str(b))\n```\n\nBut using f-strings or `format()` is generally more readable and convenient.\n\nFeel free to use any of these methods based on your preference and the version of Python you're working with."
