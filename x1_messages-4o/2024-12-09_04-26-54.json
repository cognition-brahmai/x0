I encountered an error when attempting to import from the keras module, which indicated a failure to load the native TensorFlow runtime. The error log shows an ImportError: libcublas.so.9.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory. When I run 'nvcc --version', it returns 'Cuda compilation tools, release 8.0, V8.0.61'. I suspect that this issue originates from a clash between the two CUDA versions. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is likely due to conflicting CUDA versions. TensorFlow is trying to use CUDA 9.0, but your system is set up to use CUDA 8.0 by default, as indicated by the output of `nvcc --version`. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify CUDA and cuDNN Compatibility**: Ensure that your version of TensorFlow is compatible with CUDA 9.0. You can find this information on the TensorFlow website in the installation guide.\n\n2. **Set Environment Variables**:\n   - First, make sure you have both CUDA 8.0 and 9.0 properly installed.\n   - You can set environment variables to switch between CUDA versions as needed. To use CUDA 9.0, you can temporarily set the environment variables by running the following commands in your terminal:\n\n     ```bash\n     export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-9.0\n     export PATH=$CUDA_HOME/bin:$PATH\n     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CUDA_HOME/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n     ```\n\n   - These commands set the necessary environment variables for your current session. If you want to make these changes permanent, you can add these lines to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` file and run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.bash_profile`.\n\n3. **Check SymLinks**: Ensure that the symbolic links for `libcublas.so` and other necessary libraries are correctly pointing to the CUDA 9.0 libraries. You can do this by checking the `/usr/local/cuda-9.0/lib64` directory and creating symlinks if necessary:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo ln -s /usr/local/cuda-9.0/lib64/libcublas.so /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcublas.so\n   sudo ln -s /usr/local/cuda-9.0/lib64/libcublas.so.9.0 /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcublas.so.9.0\n   ```\n\n4. **Reinstall TensorFlow**: If the above steps do not resolve the issue, consider reinstalling TensorFlow to ensure it is compiled with the correct CUDA version. Use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv tf_env\n   source tf_env/bin/activate\n   pip install tensorflow==<compatible version>\n   ```\n\n5. **Check for Conflicting Paths**: Ensure there are no conflicting paths in your environment that might point to the wrong CUDA version. You can check this with:\n\n   ```bash\n   echo $PATH\n   echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n   ```\n\n6. **Remove Unused CUDA Versions**: If you do not need CUDA 8.0, consider removing it to simplify your setup. Make sure to back up any important data before doing this.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the conflict and successfully import TensorFlow and Keras modules."
