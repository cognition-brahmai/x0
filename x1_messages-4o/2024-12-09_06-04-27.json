According to the CSV documentation, the csv.writer should use '\\r\\n' as line terminator by default. Here's my code:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\nwith open(\"test.csv\", \"w\") as f:\n    writer = csv.writer(f)\n\n    rows = [(0,1,2,3,4),\n           (-0,-1,-2,-3,-4),\n           (\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\",\"e\"),\n           (\"A\",\"B\",\"C\",\"D\",\"E\")]           \n\n    print writer.dialect.lineterminator.replace(\"\\r\", \"\\\\r\").replace(\"\\n\", \"\\\\n\")\n    writer.writerows(rows)\n    print writer.dialect.lineterminator.replace(\"\\r\", \"\\\\r\").replace(\"\\n\", \"\\\\n\")\n```\n\nThe print statement gives me '\\r\\n' as expected. But, the CSV file created uses the line terminator '\\r\\r\\n'. Is this a bug or am I using csv.writer incorrectly? I'm using Python version 2.6.2.2 on Windows Vista."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to how text files are opened and handled in Python 2 on Windows. When you open a file in text mode (`\"w\"`), Windows automatically translates `\\n` to `\\r\\n`. The `csv.writer`, by default, uses `\\r\\n` as the line terminator. This results in the `\\r\\n` from the `csv.writer` being translated to `\\r\\r\\n` when the file is written.\n\nTo address this issue, you should open the file in binary mode (`\"wb\"`) instead of text mode. This prevents the automatic translation of line endings, allowing the `csv.writer` to handle the line terminators correctly. Here's your updated code:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\nwith open(\"test.csv\", \"wb\") as f:  # Open file in binary mode\n    writer = csv.writer(f)\n\n    rows = [(0, 1, 2, 3, 4),\n            (-0, -1, -2, -3, -4),\n            (\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\"),\n            (\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\")]\n\n    print writer.dialect.lineterminator.replace(\"\\r\", \"\\\\r\").replace(\"\\n\", \"\\\\n\")\n    writer.writerows(rows)\n    print writer.dialect.lineterminator.replace(\"\\r\", \"\\\\r\").replace(\"\\n\", \"\\\\n\")\n```\n\nBy opening the file in binary mode, you should get the correct line terminator (`\\r\\n`) in the generated CSV file."
