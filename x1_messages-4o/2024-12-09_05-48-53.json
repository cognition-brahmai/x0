Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Change the current working directory\nos.chdir('/path/to/directory')\n\n# Verify the current working directory\nprint(\"Current Working Directory:\", os.getcwd())\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `'/path/to/directory'` with the actual path to the directory you want to switch to. The `os.getcwd()` function can be used to confirm the current working directory after the change."
