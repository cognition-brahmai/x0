When I use `--ignore=migrations`, it continues to produce errors/warnings for files within this directory. Could it be that `--ignore` doesn't function with directories? Is there a way to use a regular expression to match the ignored files? As a temporary solution, I've used `# pylint: disable-msg-cat=WCREFI` at the start of each migration file to ignore all Pylint errors, warnings, and information."

        "content": "The `--ignore` option in Pylint should indeed work to ignore specific directories, but it might not be functioning as expected in your case due to the way paths are specified or due to an issue with the Pylint configuration. Here are a few suggestions to ensure it works as intended:\n\n1. **Check the Path Specification**: Ensure that the path to the directory you want to ignore is specified correctly relative to where you are running the Pylint command. Try specifying it with a trailing slash, like `--ignore=migrations/`.\n\n2. **Use .pylintrc Configuration File**: You can specify directories to ignore in a `.pylintrc` configuration file. Add the following line under the `[MASTER]` section:\n   ```\n   ignore=migrations\n   ```\n   This is often more manageable than specifying options directly on the command line.\n\n3. **Use Regular Expressions for More Complex Patterns**: Pylint supports using regular expressions through the `ignore-patterns` option in the `.pylintrc` file. For example:\n   ```\n   ignore-patterns=migrations/.*\n   ```\n   This tells Pylint to ignore any files in the `migrations` directory.\n\n4. **Check for Other Configurations**: Ensure there are no other Pylint configurations in your environment that might be overriding your settings, such as a global `.pylintrc` or configurations in your IDE.\n\n5. **Ensure Pylint Version Compatibility**: Double-check that your version of Pylint supports these options, as syntax and support may vary across versions.\n\n6. **Use Command-Line Options**: If you prefer using command-line options, try the following:\n   ```\n   pylint --ignore=migrations your_project/\n   ```\n   This should ignore the specified directory when running Pylint on your project.\n\nIf none of these solutions work, you might want to double-check the command syntax and ensure there are no typos or other errors in your setup."
