I have created a MySQL table as follows:\n\n```python\nCREATE TABLE table(Id INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, Param1 VARCHAR(50))\n```\n\nand I'm trying to execute the following function:\n\n```python\n.execute(\"INSERT INTO table VALUES(%d,%s)\", (int(id), string)\n```\n\nbut it gives me this output error:\n\n```python\nTypeError: %d format: a number is required, not a str\n```\n\nI'm not sure why I am not able to execute the command. I found a similar question: [Python MySQLdb issues (TypeError: %d format: a number is required, not str)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5785154/python-mysqldb-issues) which suggests using `%s` for all fields. But I don't understand why this is the case. Why does the following command work?\n\n```python\n.execute(\"INSERT INTO table VALUES(%s,%s)\", (int(id), string)\n```\n\nCan anyone explain this to me?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is related to how the MySQLdb library in Python handles parameter substitution in SQL queries. The library expects all placeholders in the SQL query to be `%s`, regardless of the data type of the values being inserted. This is a common pattern in many Python database libraries, including MySQLdb.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening:\n\n1. **Placeholder Substitution**: In MySQLdb, the `%s` placeholder is used for all types of parameters, not just strings. This differs from Python's native string formatting, which uses `%d` for integers, `%f` for floats, etc. The library handles converting these placeholders to the appropriate SQL-safe values internally.\n\n2. **Error Explanation**: When you use `%d` in the query string, MySQLdb tries to substitute it using Python's string formatting syntax, which expects a number for `%d`. However, MySQLdb's parameter substitution mechanism doesn't understand `%d` and expects `%s` for all types, which leads to the `TypeError`.\n\n3. **Why `%s` Works**: By using `%s` for all placeholders, you're allowing MySQLdb to handle the conversion and escaping of the values properly. Even if the underlying value is an integer, MySQLdb will convert it to the correct format for the SQL query.\n\nHere's the correct way to write your query:\n\n```python\ncursor.execute(\"INSERT INTO table VALUES(%s, %s)\", (int(id), string))\n```\n\nIn this example, `int(id)` is explicitly converted to an integer, and `string` is your string value. By using `%s` for both placeholders, you allow MySQLdb to handle the substitution correctly, and it automatically converts the integer to the appropriate SQL format.\n\nRemember to always use parameterized queries like this to prevent SQL injection attacks and to ensure that your values are properly escaped."
