The month name could contain non ASCII characters, so using [A-Za-z] does not work for me. When I use \\w, it matches digits and underscore which isn't what I need. I also tried to use [:alpha:], but it's not working as well. Is there a way for me to match \\w without [_0-9], and is there a ready shortcut like [:alpha:] which works in Python?"

        "content": "In Python, you can use regular expressions to match specific patterns within a string. To achieve your goal of extracting the day, month (including non-ASCII characters), and year from the string `'19 janvier 2012'`, you can use the `re` module with a regular expression pattern that captures these groups separately.\n\nHere's a solution using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Define the string\ntext = '19 janvier 2012'\n\n# Define a regular expression pattern\n# \\d+ matches one or more digits (for the day and year)\n# [^\\W\\d_]+ matches one or more non-digit, non-underscore word characters (for the month), including non-ASCII\npattern = r'(\\d+)\\s+([^\\W\\d_]+)\\s+(\\d+)'\n\n# Use re.search to find the match\nmatch = re.search(pattern, text)\n\nif match:\n    day, month, year = match.groups()\n    print(f\"Day: {day}, Month: {month}, Year: {year}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No match found.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `\\d+` matches one or more digits, which is used for both the day and the year.\n- `[^\\W\\d_]+` is a character class that matches one or more characters that are not non-word characters (`\\W`), digits (`\\d`), or underscores (`_`). This effectively captures the month name including any non-ASCII characters.\n- `\\s+` matches one or more whitespace characters to separate the day, month, and year.\n- `re.search` is used to find the first occurrence of this pattern within the string, and `match.groups()` extracts the captured groups into `day`, `month`, and `year`.\n\nThis approach should work for any month name that may include non-ASCII characters."
