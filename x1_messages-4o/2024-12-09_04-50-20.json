        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the misuse of the `str.replace()` method. The `str.replace()` method is used to replace occurrences of a substring within a string, and it requires at least two arguments: the substring to be replaced and the replacement string. In your code, you're attempting to call the `replace()` method directly on the `str` class, which is incorrect. Instead, you need to call it on the string instance that contains the HTML content.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to replace special characters in the string:\n\n```python\nimport urllib.request\nimport re\n\n# Prompt user for URL\nurl = input(\"Please enter a URL: \")\n\n# Fetch HTML content from the URL\nresponse = urllib.request.urlopen(url)\nhtml_content = response.read().decode('utf-8')  # Decode byte content to string\n\n# Use regular expression to replace special characters with spaces\ncleaned_content = re.sub(r\"[!@#$%^&*()\\[\\]{};:,./<>?\\|`~\\-=_+]\", \" \", html_content)\n\n# Split the cleaned string into words\nwords = cleaned_content.split()\n\n# Print the first 20 words\nprint(\"Words list: \", words[:20])\n```\n\n### Key Modifications:\n1. **Decoding HTML Content**: Use `decode('utf-8')` to convert the byte content to a string after reading it from the URL.\n2. **Regular Expression for Replacement**: Utilize the `re.sub()` method from the `re` module to replace all special characters with a space. This approach is more efficient for replacing multiple different characters in a single step.\n3. **Accessing String Methods Correctly**: Ensure that you are calling the `replace()` method on the actual string variable `html_content`, not on the `str` class.\n\nBy making these changes, you should be able to replace special characters and extract words from the HTML content successfully."
