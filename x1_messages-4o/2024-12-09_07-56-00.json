I have a function that I want to apply to each row and if the function returns true, I want to keep the row, otherwise discard it. For instance, my function could be something like this:\n\n```python\ndef f(row):\n    if sum(row)>10: return True\n    else: return False\n```\n\nI'm familiar with `np.apply_over_axes()`, which applies a function to each row of a numpy array and returns the result. However, I'm looking for something similar to a hypothetical `np.filter_over_axes()` that would apply a function to each row of a numpy array and only return rows for which the function returned true. Does such a function exist or should I just use a for loop?"

        "content": "Numpy does not have a built-in function specifically like `np.filter_over_axes()`, but you can achieve the desired behavior using boolean indexing, which is both efficient and concise. Here\u2019s how you can filter rows of a numpy array based on your custom function:\n\nFirst, you can use a list comprehension to create a boolean mask that represents whether each row satisfies the condition specified by your function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Example numpy array\narray = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]])\n\n# Function to apply to each row\ndef f(row):\n    return sum(row) > 10\n\n# Create a boolean mask using a list comprehension\nmask = np.array([f(row) for row in array])\n\n# Use the mask to filter the rows\nfiltered_array = array[mask]\n\nprint(filtered_array)\n```\n\nHere's what each part of this code does:\n- The list comprehension `[f(row) for row in array]` applies the function `f` to each row of the array and generates a list of boolean values.\n- `np.array([...])` converts the list of boolean values into a numpy array, which serves as a mask.\n- `array[mask]` uses this boolean mask to filter the rows of the original array, returning only those for which the mask is `True`.\n\nThis approach leverages numpy\u2019s powerful indexing capabilities and avoids the need for explicitly iterating over rows with a for loop, making it efficient and concise."
