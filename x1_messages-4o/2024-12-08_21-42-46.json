        "content": "To evaluate a subtraction arithmetic expression in C#, you simply need to subtract one integer from another using the subtraction operator (`-`). Here's a simple C# code snippet that calculates the result of 46 subtracted by 32:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        int number1 = 46;\n        int number2 = 32;\n        int result = number1 - number2;\n        \n        Console.WriteLine(\"The result of 46 subtracted by 32 is: \" + result);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We declare two integer variables, `number1` and `number2`, and assign them the values 46 and 32, respectively.\n- We perform the subtraction using the `-` operator and store the result in the `result` variable.\n- Finally, we output the result to the console using `Console.WriteLine`. \n\nWhen you run this code, it will display:\n\n```\nThe result of 46 subtracted by 32 is: 14\n```\n\nYou can compile and run this C# code in any C# development environment, such as Visual Studio or an online C# compiler."
