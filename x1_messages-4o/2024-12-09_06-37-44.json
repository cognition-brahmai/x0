The user requests a graph/data in a web-interface, the server runs calculations, and while the server is running calculations, a small container is updated with the calculation progress. Once the calculation is done, the graph is shown to the user. I am looking for a simple way to set this up, without having to setup a separate server to handle a messaging queue. I am thinking of setting up a REST API to handle the polling in Flask, but I am unsure of how to retrieve the actual updates. Here are my questions:\n\n1. Can I use the file system to achieve this? Can AJAX/jQuery read messages from a file, perhaps saving the progress to a .json file?\n2. Could I use pickling to pickle a message dictionary which could be read by the API handling the polling?\n3. Is polling the right approach or is there a better or more common pattern to handle this?"

        "content": "Setting up a system to handle calculations and update a web interface with progress can be approached in various ways. Let's address your questions one by one:\n\n1. **File System for Progress Updates:**\n   - Yes, you can use the file system to store progress updates. You could write the progress of your calculations to a `.json` file, which your frontend can then read using AJAX/jQuery. However, keep in mind that frequent file I/O operations can be slow and may not scale well if many users are simultaneously using the system.\n   - Example: You can update a `progress.json` file with the current state of the calculations, and your frontend can poll this file periodically to update the progress bar.\n\n2. **Using Pickling for Message Dictionary:**\n   - Pickling is a way to serialize and deserialize Python objects. While you could use pickling to save the progress of calculations, it's typically used for Python-specific object serialization and isn't as straightforward for web interfaces, which usually work better with JSON.\n   - If you choose this route, you'd need to handle the reading and unpickling of the file in your Flask app, and then send the data to the frontend in a JSON format.\n\n3. **Polling vs. Other Approaches:**\n   - **Polling:** This is a simple and straightforward method where the client periodically requests the server for updates. While easy to implement, it can be inefficient due to the continuous requests being sent to the server.\n   - **Long Polling:** An improved version of polling where the server sends a response only when there's new information available. This reduces the number of requests compared to regular polling.\n   - **WebSockets:** A more modern approach that allows for real-time communication between the client and server. WebSockets can be more efficient and responsive compared to polling, especially if you expect many users or require real-time updates.\n   - **Server-Sent Events (SSE):** Another approach for pushing updates from the server to the client. It's simpler than WebSockets and can be a good fit for one-way updates like progress notifications.\n\nGiven your requirements, starting with simple polling might be the easiest way to get things up and running. As your application grows, you can consider moving to WebSockets or SSE for better performance and real-time capabilities. Flask has extensions like `Flask-SocketIO` that can help with implementing WebSockets if you decide to go that route later on."
