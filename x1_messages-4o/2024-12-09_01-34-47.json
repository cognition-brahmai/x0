I tried to load the pre-trained file and fit the model using the following code:\n```python\nnew_model = Sequential()\n\nnew_model.add(ResNet50(include_top=False,\n                pooling='avg',\n                weights=resnet_weight_paths))\n\ntrain_generator = data_generator.flow_from_directory(\n    'path_to_the_training_set',\n    target_size = (IMG_SIZE,IMG_SIZE),\n    batch_size = 12,\n    class_mode = 'categorical'\n    )\n\nvalidation_generator = data_generator.flow_from_directory(\n    'path_to_the_validation_set',\n    target_size = (IMG_SIZE,IMG_SIZE),\n    class_mode = 'categorical'\n    )\n\nnew_model.fit_generator(\n    train_generator,\n    steps_per_epoch = 3,\n    validation_data = validation_generator,\n    validation_steps = 1\n)\n```\nIn the training dataset, I have two folders, dog and cat, each containing almost 10,000 images. When I compiled the script, I get an error which says: \"Allocation of 38535168 exceeds 10% of system memory.\" How can I optimize the way to load the pre-trained model or get rid of this warning message?"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering is related to memory allocation, suggesting that your current setup is exceeding the available system memory. Here are some strategies to optimize memory usage and potentially resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Reduce Batch Size**: The batch size you are using is 12, which might be too large given your system's memory constraints. Try reducing the batch size to a smaller number, like 4 or 8.\n\n    ```python\n    train_generator = data_generator.flow_from_directory(\n        'path_to_the_training_set',\n        target_size=(IMG_SIZE, IMG_SIZE),\n        batch_size=4,  # Reduced batch size\n        class_mode='categorical'\n    )\n    ```\n\n2. **Optimize Image Size**: If possible, reduce the target image size (`IMG_SIZE`) to a smaller dimension. This will reduce the amount of memory required to process each image.\n\n3. **Use a Model Subset**: If you're running out of memory during model training, you might consider using a smaller version of ResNet, like ResNet34 or a more compact architecture designed for smaller devices.\n\n4. **Enable Mixed Precision Training**: If you are using a GPU that supports mixed precision, enable it to reduce memory usage and improve performance.\n\n    ```python\n    from tensorflow.keras.mixed_precision import experimental as mixed_precision\n    policy = mixed_precision.Policy('mixed_float16')\n    mixed_precision.set_policy(policy)\n    ```\n\n5. **Clear Session**: Before running the model, clear the Keras session to free up memory from any previous models.\n\n    ```python\n    from tensorflow.keras import backend as K\n    K.clear_session()\n    ```\n\n6. **Avoid Using `fit_generator`**: Consider using `model.fit()` instead of `fit_generator()`, as `fit_generator()` is now deprecated. Update your TensorFlow and Keras to the latest version to use the updated API.\n\n    ```python\n    new_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])\n    new_model.fit(\n        train_generator,\n        steps_per_epoch=3,\n        validation_data=validation_generator,\n        validation_steps=1\n    )\n    ```\n\n7. **Check Background Processes**: Ensure no other memory-intensive applications are running in the background, which might be consuming system memory.\n\n8. **System Swap**: If you are using a system with limited RAM, consider adding swap space. This will allow your system to use disk space as \"virtual memory,\" which can prevent memory errors, though it may slow down processing.\n\nBy applying these strategies, you should be able to manage your system's memory usage more effectively and avoid the allocation error."
