        "content": "True. Self-driving cars are considered feasible for highways. Highways provide a more controlled environment with consistent traffic flow, well-marked lanes, and fewer obstacles like pedestrians and intersections, which makes it easier for autonomous systems to navigate. Many companies are actively testing and deploying self-driving technology specifically for highway use due to these favorable conditions. However, the feasibility also depends on regulatory approvals, technological advancements, and public acceptance."
