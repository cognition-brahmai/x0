        "content": "To add a directory to the `PYTHONPATH` in Windows so that Python can recognize modules located in that directory, you need to set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Open Environment Variables:**\n   - Right-click on 'This PC' or 'My Computer' on your desktop or in File Explorer and select 'Properties'.\n   - Click on 'Advanced system settings'.\n   - In the System Properties window, click on the 'Environment Variables' button.\n\n2. **Set PYTHONPATH:**\n   - In the Environment Variables window, you have two sections: one for user variables and another for system variables. You can add `PYTHONPATH` as a user variable if you only want it to affect your user account, or as a system variable if you want it to affect all users.\n   - Click 'New' under the appropriate section.\n   - For the variable name, enter `PYTHONPATH`.\n   - For the variable value, enter the path to your directory, e.g., `C:\\My_Projects`.\n   - Click 'OK' to close each dialog box.\n\n3. **Verify PYTHONPATH:**\n   - Open a new Command Prompt window to ensure that the changes are applied.\n   - Type `echo %PYTHONPATH%` and press Enter. It should display `C:\\My_Projects`.\n\n4. **Check your Django setup:**\n   - Ensure that your Django project is correctly structured. The directory `C:\\My_Projects` should contain the Django apps or be the parent directory of your Django project.\n   - Make sure you are running your Django commands from the correct directory. Typically, this is the base directory of your Django project where `manage.py` is located.\n\n5. **Restart Your IDE (if applicable):**\n   - If you're using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm or VSCode, restart it to ensure it picks up the new environment variable settings.\n\nAfter setting the `PYTHONPATH`, try running your Django project again. If you encounter any further issues, double-check that the app name 'coltrane' is correct and exists within your project structure."
