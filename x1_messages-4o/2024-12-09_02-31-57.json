        "content": "The warning you're encountering indicates that the `sets` module you're using in your Python script is deprecated. In modern Python versions (Python 2.6 and later), the functionality provided by the `sets` module has been incorporated into the built-in `set` and `frozenset` types. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Replace `sets.Set` with `set`:**\n   If you're using `sets.Set`, replace it with the built-in `set`. Here's an example:\n\n   ```python\n   # Old code using the sets module\n   import sets\n   my_set = sets.Set([1, 2, 3])\n\n   # Updated code using the built-in set\n   my_set = set([1, 2, 3])\n   ```\n\n2. **Replace `sets.ImmutableSet` with `frozenset`:**\n   If you're using `sets.ImmutableSet`, replace it with the built-in `frozenset`. Here's an example:\n\n   ```python\n   # Old code using the sets module\n   import sets\n   my_frozenset = sets.ImmutableSet([1, 2, 3])\n\n   # Updated code using the built-in frozenset\n   my_frozenset = frozenset([1, 2, 3])\n   ```\n\n3. **Remove the import statement:**\n   Since you're no longer using the `sets` module, you can remove the `import sets` statement from your script.\n\nAfter making these changes, your script should work without the deprecation warning. If you have further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!"
