However, when I try to match a new line character in raw string using r'\\\\n', it doesn't work. Can someone suggest a solution for this?"

        "content": "When you're using raw strings in Python, the backslash `\\` is treated as a literal character, which means it doesn't escape the following character like it does in a regular string. This can be useful for regular expressions where you don't want backslashes to be interpreted as escape characters.\n\nHowever, if you're trying to match a newline character using a raw string in Python, using `r'\\n'` will indeed treat it as two separate characters: a backslash and an 'n'. To match an actual newline character in a raw string, you should just use the newline character directly in your regular expression pattern.\n\nHere's how you can achieve that:\n\n1. Use a regular string to match the newline character:\n   ```python\n   import re\n\n   pattern = '\\n'  # Regular string to match a newline character\n   text = \"Hello\\nWorld\"\n   matches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n   print(matches)  # Output: ['\\n']\n   ```\n\n2. Use a raw string but double the backslashes to escape them:\n   ```python\n   import re\n\n   pattern = r'\\\\n'  # Raw string, but this matches the literal string '\\n', not a newline character\n   text = \"Hello\\\\nWorld\"\n   matches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n   print(matches)  # Output: ['\\\\n']\n   ```\n\nFor matching actual newline characters in text, it's often simpler to use the first method. However, if you are dealing with text that literally contains the characters `\\` followed by `n`, then the second method is appropriate."
