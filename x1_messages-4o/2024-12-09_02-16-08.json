The error message says, \"Cannot assign \"1\": \"Team.department_id\" must be a \"Department\" instance\". I think it could be an issue with how I'm implementing the foreign key concept. I'm trying to create a new team and attach it to a department, so the department ID should be in both tables. The code I'm using to create a new team is:\n\n```python\nnew_team = Team(\n    nickname = team_name,\n    employee_id = employee_id,\n    department_id = int(Department.objects.get(password = password, department_name = department_name).department_id)\n)\n```\nThe relevant parts of my models.py file are:\n\n```python\nclass Department(models.Model):  \n    department_id = models.AutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True, default=1)  \n    department_name = models.CharField(max_length=60)\n    head_id = models.CharField(max_length=30)\n    password = models.CharField(max_length=128)\n\nclass Team(models.Model):  \n    team_id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)\n    department_id = models.ForeignKey('Department', related_name = 'Department_id')\n    employee_id = models.CharField(max_length=30)\n    nickname = models.CharField(max_length=60)\n    team_image = models.ImageField(upload_to=get_image_path, blank=True, null=True)\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the way you're trying to set the `department_id` for the `Team` model. In Django, when you have a ForeignKey relationship, you need to assign an instance of the related model (in this case, a `Department` instance) rather than just the ID.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to fix the issue:\n\n1. Retrieve the `Department` instance you want to associate with the new `Team`.\n2. Assign that instance to the `department_id` field of the `Team`.\n\nYour code should look like this:\n\n```python\n# Retrieve the Department instance\ndepartment_instance = Department.objects.get(password=password, department_name=department_name)\n\n# Create a new Team with the Department instance\nnew_team = Team(\n    nickname=team_name,\n    employee_id=employee_id,\n    department_id=department_instance  # Assign the instance here\n)\nnew_team.save()  # Don't forget to save the new team\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **ForeignKey Field**: In Django, a ForeignKey field expects an instance of the related model, not just an integer ID. This allows Django to maintain the relational integrity between models.\n  \n- **Retrieving an Instance**: Use `Department.objects.get()` to retrieve the `Department` instance that matches your criteria (`password` and `department_name`).\n\n- **Assignment**: Assign the `Department` instance to the `department_id` field of your `Team` object.\n\nThis will ensure that your `Team` object is properly linked to the `Department` instance, adhering to Django's ORM conventions."
