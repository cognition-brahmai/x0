My basic discord.py script is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport discord\nimport asyncio\nimport logging\n\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n\nclient = discord.Client()\n\n@client.event\nasync def on_ready():\n    print('Logged in as')\n    print(client.user.name)\n    print(client.user.id)\n    print('------')\n    print(client)\n\n\n@client.event\nasync def on_message(message):\n    print(message)\n    if message.content.startswith('!test'):\n        counter = 0\n        tmp = await client.send_message(message.channel, 'Calculating messages...')\n        async for log in client.logs_from(message.channel, limit=100):\n            if log.author == message.author:\n                counter += 1\n\n        await client.edit_message(tmp, 'You have {} messages.'.format(counter))\n    elif message.content.startswith('!sleep'):\n        await asyncio.sleep(5)\n        await client.send_message(message.channel, 'Done sleeping')\n\nclient.run('token')\n```\n\nWhen I add the line `server = await client.accept_invite('instant-invite-code')` to the `on_ready` function, replacing \"instant-invite-code\" with my actual instant invite code, I get an error: `discord.errors.Forbidden: FORBIDDEN (status code: 403): Bots cannot use this endpoint`. The logging works fine, it provides output with my username and id. My bot is registered with the discord API and I already have a token. How can I make my bot join the server?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to Discord's API restrictions that prevent bots from using invite links to join servers. Bots need to be explicitly invited to servers using a special invite link that includes the bot's client ID and the necessary permissions.\n\nHere's how you can invite your bot to a server:\n\n1. **Create a Bot Invite Link:**\n   You need to generate an invite link with the appropriate permissions. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n   - Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and select your application.\n   - Navigate to the \"OAuth2\" section.\n   - In the \"Scopes\" section, select `bot`.\n   - In the \"Bot Permissions\" section, choose the permissions your bot needs (e.g., `Send Messages`, `Read Message History`).\n   - Copy the generated URL from the \"Scopes\" section.\n\n2. **Invite the Bot to Your Server:**\n   - Paste the generated URL into your browser.\n   - Select the server you want to add the bot to.\n   - Authorize the bot to join the server.\n\n3. **Run the Bot Script:**\n   - Once the bot is invited to your server, run your script as usual. Your bot will automatically connect to the server and start listening for events.\n\n4. **Update Your Code:**\n   - Since the method to join a server via invite links is not applicable, you can remove the line `server = await client.accept_invite('instant-invite-code')` from your `on_ready` function.\n\nOnce you've invited your bot using the proper invite link, it should be able to interact with the server based on the permissions you granted during the invite process."
