Currently, I have managed to write a recursive function for 2^n as shown below:\n\n```python\ndef required_steps(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    return 2 * required_steps(n-1)\n```\n\nHowever, I am not sure how to modify this function to subtract 1 and still maintain the recursive structure. The function should always assume that the parameter 'n' is a positive integer and greater than 0. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To modify your recursive function to calculate \\(2^n - 1\\), you can simply subtract 1 from the result at the base case or at the return statement. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef required_steps(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0  # Base case: 2^0 - 1 = 0\n    return 2 * required_steps(n - 1) + 1\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Base Case**: When \\(n = 0\\), the value should be \\(2^0 - 1 = 0\\), so you return 0.\n- **Recursive Case**: For \\(n > 0\\), the function calls itself with \\(n - 1\\), calculates \\(2^{(n-1)} - 1\\), and then multiplies the result by 2 and adds 1. This effectively computes \\(2^n - 1\\).\n\nThis recursive structure maintains the property of calculating \\(2^n - 1\\) by using the relationship:\n\n\\[2^n - 1 = 2 \\times (2^{(n-1)} - 1) + 1\\]\n\nYou can call `required_steps(n)` with any positive integer \\(n\\) to get the desired result."
