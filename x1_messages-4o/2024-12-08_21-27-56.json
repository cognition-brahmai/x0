        "content": "To achieve this, you can write a C++ program that accepts input from the command line and then outputs the student's name, grade, and an adjective based on their performance. You can then run this compiled C++ program from a shell command. Here's a simple C++ code snippet that demonstrates this:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n\nstd::string getPerformanceAdjective(int grade) {\n    if (grade >= 90) {\n        return \"outstanding\";\n    } else if (grade >= 75) {\n        return \"excellent\";\n    } else if (grade >= 50) {\n        return \"good\";\n    } else {\n        return \"needs improvement\";\n    }\n}\n\nint main(int argc, char* argv[]) {\n    if (argc != 3) {\n        std::cerr << \"Usage: \" << argv[0] << \" <name> <grade>\" << std::endl;\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    std::string name = argv[1];\n    int grade = std::stoi(argv[2]);\n\n    std::string performance = getPerformanceAdjective(grade);\n\n    std::cout << \"Student Name: \" << name << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Grade: \" << grade << \"%\" << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Performance: \" << performance << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nHere's how you can compile and run this program from the shell:\n\n1. Save the C++ code to a file, say `student_performance.cpp`.\n2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler like g++:\n\n   ```bash\n   g++ -o student_performance student_performance.cpp\n   ```\n\n3. Run the compiled program with the student's name and grade as arguments:\n\n   ```bash\n   ./student_performance Alice 100\n   ```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nStudent Name: Alice\nGrade: 100%\nPerformance: outstanding\n```\n\nYou can adjust the grade thresholds and adjectives in the `getPerformanceAdjective` function to match your specific criteria for performance descriptions."
