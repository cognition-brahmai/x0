However, there are a few more details to ensure everything works properly, such as properly handling the database connection and processing the results. Below is a more comprehensive guide:\n\n1. **Establish a Database Connection**: Before executing any SQL query, make sure you have a proper connection to your database.\n\n2. **Execute the Query**: Use the `exec` function to execute your SQL query.\n\n3. **Fetch and Process Results**: Use the `fetch` function to retrieve the results and process them as needed.\n\nHere's a complete example:\n\n```matlab\n% Connect to the database\ndatasource = 'your_data_source_name';\nusername = 'your_username';\npassword = 'your_password';\nconnection = database(datasource, username, password);\n\n% Check connection status\nif isopen(connection)\n    fprintf('Connection successful.\\n');\nelse\n    error('Connection failed: %s', connection.Message);\nend\n\n% Define the date range\nstart_date = '2023-01-01'; % Example start date\nend_date = '2023-12-31';   % Example end date\n\n% Construct the SQL query\nquery = sprintf(\"SELECT * FROM customers WHERE date BETWEEN '%s' AND '%s'\", start_date, end_date);\n\n% Execute the query\nresult = exec(connection, query);\n\n% Fetch the data\ndata = fetch(result);\n\n% Check if the data was fetched successfully\nif isstruct(data) && isfield(data, 'Data')\n    customers = data.Data;\n    disp('Data fetched successfully:');\n    disp(customers);\nelse\n    disp('No data found or error fetching data.');\nend\n\n% Close the database connection\nclose(connection);\n```\n\n### Notes:\n- Replace `'your_data_source_name'`, `'your_username'`, and `'your_password'` with your actual database credentials.\n- Ensure you have the necessary toolboxes like Database Toolbox and the appropriate JDBC or ODBC driver installed and configured.\n- Handle exceptions or errors gracefully, especially in production code, to ensure the application can recover or fail gracefully.\n- Depending on your database and date format, you might need to adjust the date format in the query string.\n- Always sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection if using user-provided data."
