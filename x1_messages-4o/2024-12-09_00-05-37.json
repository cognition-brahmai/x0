A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward. Your program should be able to handle strings with both uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as special characters and spaces. Can you create a solution that is efficient and effective for even the longest and most complex strings?"

        "content": "Certainly! Here's a Python program that identifies the longest palindrome within a given string. This solution uses a dynamic programming approach to efficiently find the longest palindromic substring. It handles strings with mixed cases, spaces, and special characters gracefully.\n\n```python\ndef longest_palindrome(s: str) -> str:\n    n = len(s)\n    if n == 0:\n        return \"\"\n\n    # Table to store results of subproblems\n    dp = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]\n\n    # All substrings of length 1 are palindromes\n    start = 0\n    max_length = 1\n    for i in range(n):\n        dp[i][i] = True\n\n    # Check for substrings of length 2\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        if s[i] == s[i + 1]:\n            dp[i][i + 1] = True\n            start = i\n            max_length = 2\n\n    # Check for lengths greater than 2\n    for length in range(3, n + 1):\n        for i in range(n - length + 1):\n            j = i + length - 1\n            # Check if the current substring is palindrome\n            if s[i] == s[j] and dp[i + 1][j - 1]:\n                dp[i][j] = True\n                if length > max_length:\n                    start = i\n                    max_length = length\n\n    return s[start:start + max_length]\n\n# Test the function\ninput_string = \"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama\"\n# Preprocessing input to ignore non-alphanumeric characters\nimport re\nprocessed_string = re.sub(r'[^A-Za-z0-9]', '', input_string).lower()\nprint(\"Original String:\", input_string)\nprint(\"Longest Palindrome:\", longest_palindrome(processed_string))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Preprocessing**: We first preprocess the input string to ignore non-alphanumeric characters and convert all letters to lowercase to handle case insensitivity.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We create a 2D table (`dp`) to store whether a substring `s[i:j+1]` is a palindrome.\n\n3. **Base Cases**:\n   - All single-character substrings are palindromes.\n   - Check for two-character palindromes.\n\n4. **Fill the Table**: For substrings longer than two characters, we check if the current substring is a palindrome by comparing the characters at the current endpoints and checking if the substring within those endpoints is also a palindrome.\n\n5. **Result**: The longest palindromic substring is extracted using the `start` and `max_length` determined from the table.\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the longest palindrome even in complex strings."
