        "content": "In Python, the scope of a random seed set using `random.seed(my_seed)` is module-wide, meaning that it affects all uses of the `random` module within the same Python process. When you set a seed using `random.seed()`, it initializes the random number generator to a predictable state, and this affects all subsequent calls to any random functions from the `random` module.\n\nTherefore, if you set the seed using `random.seed(my_seed)` in one class within your module, it will persist and affect any other classes or functions within the same module that utilize the `random` module. This is true as long as they are executed within the same runtime environment or process. If you want to have different random sequences in different parts of your code, you would need to reseed the random number generator accordingly or use separate instances of a random number generator, such as `random.Random()`, which allows for independent random number generators with their own seeds."
