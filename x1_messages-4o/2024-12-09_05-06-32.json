        "content": "The error message you're encountering is due to the way you're formatting the SQL statement placeholders. In MySQL's Python connector, all placeholders should use `%s`, regardless of the data type. Currently, you're using `%d` for integers, which is causing the issue.\n\nHere's how you can fix your code:\n\n```python\nimport mysql.connector\n\ncnx = mysql.connector.connect(user='root', password='',\n                              host='127.0.0.1',\n                              database='DB')\ncursor = cnx.cursor()\n\nName = \"James\"\nDepartment = \"Finance\"\nStartYear = 2001\nCurrentPos = 2001\nLink = \"\"\n\nadd_user = (\"INSERT INTO DB.tbluser \"\n            \"(username, department, startyear, currentpos, link) \"\n            \"VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s)\")\n\ndata_user = (Name, Department, StartYear, CurrentPos, Link)\ncursor.execute(add_user, data_user)\ncnx.commit()\n\ncursor.close()\ncnx.close()\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Placeholders**: Use `%s` for all placeholders in the SQL statement, regardless of whether the data is a string, integer, or any other type.\n2. **Data Tuple**: The data tuple remains unchanged because it already contains the correct values to be inserted.\n\nThis should resolve the error, and your script should be able to insert the data into the database as expected."
