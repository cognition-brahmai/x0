        "content": "In Python, when using the `logging` module, it's generally considered best practice to define a logger for each module or class. This allows you to have more granular control over logging output, such as setting different log levels for different parts of your application, and it makes it easier to identify the source of log messages.\n\nHere's a common pattern:\n\n1. **Module-Level Logger**: Define a logger at the module level using `logging.getLogger(__name__)`. This is beneficial because the `__name__` attribute will provide a logger name that reflects the module's import path, helping to trace where log messages originate from.\n\n2. **Class-Level Logger**: If you have a very large class or if the class has multiple responsibilities, you might want to define a logger for each class. This is especially useful if the class is part of a larger application and you need to distinguish logs from different components.\n\n3. **Configuration**: Configure your logging (e.g., log level, handlers, formatters) once at the entry point of your application. This way, all loggers will inherit these configurations unless specifically overridden.\n\nRegarding your idea of abstracting logging to its own class and importing an instance into each class, this can work, but it might introduce some complexity:\n\n- **Pros**: Centralizes logging configuration and makes it easy to manage log settings across the application.\n- **Cons**: Can make it harder to trace the origin of log messages, especially if multiple classes share the same logger instance. It might also lead to a less flexible setup if different parts of your application require different logging configurations.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of defining a logger for each class:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\nclass MyClass:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.logger = logging.getLogger(self.__class__.__name__)\n        self.logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\n    def my_method(self):\n        self.logger.debug('This is a debug message')\n\n# Configure logging once in your application\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n\n# Usage\nobj = MyClass()\nobj.my_method()\n```\n\nThis approach helps you maintain clarity about where log messages are coming from while keeping the flexibility of individual log configurations."
