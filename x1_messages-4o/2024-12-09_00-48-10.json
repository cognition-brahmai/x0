My attempt was to make a function `recursive_generator(lis)` that yields the first element of the list and then calls itself with the remainder of the list. However, when I iterate over this generator with the list `[6,3,9,1]`, it only returns the first item `6`. How can I modify my generator so that it works recursively and yields all items in the list, essentially transferring the `yield` command to the level above in a recursion scheme? Here's my current code:\n\n```python\ndef recursive_generator(lis):\n    yield lis[0]\n    recursive_generator(lis[1:])\n\nfor k in recursive_generator([6,3,9,1]):\n    print(k)\n```"

        "content": "The issue with your current implementation is that while you are calling the `recursive_generator` function recursively, you are not actually yielding from the recursive call. In Python, to yield items from another generator or iterator, you need to use the `yield from` statement.\n\nHere's how you can modify your `recursive_generator` function to correctly yield all the items in the list recursively:\n\n```python\ndef recursive_generator(lis):\n    if not lis:\n        return\n    yield lis[0]\n    yield from recursive_generator(lis[1:])\n\nfor k in recursive_generator([6, 3, 9, 1]):\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Base Case**: The function checks if the list is empty (`if not lis:`). If it is, the function returns immediately, which stops further recursion.\n2. **Yield First Element**: It yields the first element of the list (`yield lis[0]`).\n3. **Recursive Call**: Instead of just calling `recursive_generator` with `lis[1:]`, it uses `yield from recursive_generator(lis[1:])` to yield all elements from the recursive call.\n\nThis setup ensures that each element of the list is yielded one by one as the recursion unfolds."
