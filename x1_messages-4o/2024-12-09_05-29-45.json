        "content": "To clear the contents of a `ttk.Treeview` in Tkinter when a button is pressed, you can iterate through the items in the `Treeview` and delete them one by one. Here's a step-by-step guide and an example of how you can achieve this:\n\n1. First, make sure you have your `Treeview` and button set up.\n2. Create a function that will be called when the button is pressed. This function will clear the contents of the `Treeview`.\n3. Use the `delete` method of the `Treeview` to remove items. You can obtain the IDs of all the items using the `get_children` method and then iterate over them to delete each one.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\nfrom tkinter import ttk\n\ndef clear_treeview():\n    # Get all items in the treeview\n    for item in tree.get_children():\n        # Delete each item\n        tree.delete(item)\n\n# Set up the main window\nroot = tk.Tk()\nroot.title(\"Treeview Clear Example\")\n\n# Create a Treeview widget\ntree = ttk.Treeview(root, columns=(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"), show='headings')\ntree.heading(\"A\", text=\"Column A\")\ntree.heading(\"B\", text=\"Column B\")\ntree.heading(\"C\", text=\"Column C\")\n\n# Add some sample data\nfor i in range(10):\n    tree.insert(\"\", \"end\", values=(i, i*2, i*3))\n\n# Pack the Treeview\ntree.pack()\n\n# Create a button to clear the Treeview\nclear_button = tk.Button(root, text=\"Clear\", command=clear_treeview)\nclear_button.pack()\n\n# Run the application\nroot.mainloop()\n```\n\nIn this example, the `clear_treeview` function is called when the \"Clear\" button is pressed. It iterates through all the items in the `Treeview` using `tree.get_children()` and deletes each one using `tree.delete(item)`. This will effectively clear all the data from the `Treeview`."
