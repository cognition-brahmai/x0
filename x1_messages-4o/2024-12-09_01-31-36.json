Then, sort the middle part and concatenate them back together. Here's a Python code snippet to do that:\n\n```python\nl = ['f', 'g', 'p', 'a', 'p', 'c', 'b', 'q', 'z', 'n', 'd', 't', 'q']\n\n# Separate the list into parts\np_part = [x for x in l if x == 'p']\nq_part = [x for x in l if x == 'q']\nmiddle_part = [x for x in l if x != 'p' and x != 'q']\n\n# Sort the middle part\nmiddle_part.sort()\n\n# Concatenate the parts together\nresult = p_part + middle_part + q_part\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will give you the desired output:\n\n```\n['p', 'p', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'f', 'g', 'n', 't', 'z', 'q', 'q']\n```"
