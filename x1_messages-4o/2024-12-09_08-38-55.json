I have a method to read a single csv file using numpy.genfromtxt() function and perform calculations on the data. I also know how to list all csv files in a directory using glob, but I am not sure how to combine these two to read all csv files in a directory. The folder contains only csv and jpg files, and the csv files are named in the format eventX.csv, where X ranges from 1 to 50. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To read all CSV files in a directory and perform calculations on each one iteratively, you can combine the functionality of `glob` to list the files and `numpy.genfromtxt()` to read them. Below is a step-by-step guide and example code to achieve this:\n\n1. **Import necessary modules**:\n   - `glob` to list files in the directory.\n   - `numpy` to handle CSV reading and calculations.\n\n2. **List all CSV files**:\n   - Use `glob.glob()` to get a list of all CSV files in the directory.\n\n3. **Iteratively read and process each CSV file**:\n   - Loop through the list of CSV files and use `numpy.genfromtxt()` to read each file.\n   - Perform your calculations on the data.\n\nHere's a sample Python script to demonstrate this process:\n\n```python\nimport glob\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef process_csv(file_path):\n    # Read the CSV file\n    data = np.genfromtxt(file_path, delimiter=',', skip_header=1)  # Adjust skip_header if there's no header\n\n    # Perform calculations on the data\n    # Example: calculate the sum of each column\n    column_sums = np.sum(data, axis=0)\n    \n    # Print or store the results\n    print(f\"Processing {file_path}:\")\n    print(\"Column sums:\", column_sums)\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\ndef main():\n    # Define the path to the directory containing the CSV files\n    directory_path = 'path/to/your/folder/'\n\n    # Use glob to list all CSV files in the directory\n    csv_files = glob.glob(f\"{directory_path}event*.csv\")\n\n    # Iterate over each CSV file and process it\n    for csv_file in csv_files:\n        process_csv(csv_file)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **File Path**: Replace `'path/to/your/folder/'` with the actual path to your folder containing the CSV files.\n- **File Pattern**: The pattern `event*.csv` is used to match files named like `eventX.csv`. Adjust this pattern if necessary.\n- **Data Processing**: Modify the `process_csv()` function to include the specific calculations you need to perform on your CSV data.\n- **Error Handling**: Consider adding error handling to manage files that might not match the expected structure.\n\nThis script will iterate over all CSV files matching the pattern and perform the specified calculations on each one sequentially."
