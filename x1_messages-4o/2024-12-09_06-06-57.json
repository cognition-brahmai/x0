Specifically, I require DOM support, handling of HTML entities like `&nbsp;`, and handling of partial documents. If possible, I would also like to have XPATH support and the ability to handle unclosed or malformed tags. I tried using the xml.etree.ElementTree library for this, but my solution isn't robust enough. \n\nHere's the code I used:\n```\nfrom xml.etree.ElementTree import fromstring\nDOM = fromstring(\"<html>%s</html>\" % html.replace('&nbsp;', '&#160;'))\n```"

        "content": "Parsing malformed HTML using only Python's standard libraries can indeed be quite challenging, especially when dealing with incomplete or improperly nested tags. While libraries like `BeautifulSoup` from `bs4` or `lxml` are typically recommended for handling such tasks, sticking strictly to Python's standard libraries limits your options significantly. However, you can use a combination of `html.parser` and `xml.etree.ElementTree`, though with some limitations.\n\nHere's a basic approach using `html.parser` for parsing HTML content, which can be more forgiving than `xml.etree.ElementTree`:\n\n```python\nfrom html.parser import HTMLParser\nfrom xml.etree.ElementTree import Element, tostring\n\nclass MyHTMLParser(HTMLParser):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.root = Element('html')\n        self.current = self.root\n\n    def handle_starttag(self, tag, attrs):\n        new_elem = Element(tag)\n        for attr, value in attrs:\n            new_elem.set(attr, value)\n        self.current.append(new_elem)\n        self.current = new_elem\n\n    def handle_endtag(self, tag):\n        if self.current is not self.root:\n            self.current = self.current.getparent()\n\n    def handle_data(self, data):\n        if self.current is not None:\n            self.current.text = (self.current.text or '') + data\n\n    def handle_entityref(self, name):\n        self.handle_data(f'&{name};')\n\n    def handle_charref(self, name):\n        self.handle_data(f'&#{name};')\n\ndef parse_html(html):\n    parser = MyHTMLParser()\n    parser.feed(html)\n    return parser.root\n\n# Example usage:\nhtml = \"<div>Some content &nbsp; with <b>bold</b> text and <i>italic\"\nparsed_dom = parse_html(html)\nprint(tostring(parsed_dom, encoding='unicode'))\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **HTMLParser**: We use Python's `HTMLParser` to parse the HTML content. It's more lenient than `xml.etree.ElementTree` when it comes to malformed HTML.\n\n2. **Custom Element Handling**: The `MyHTMLParser` class creates an XML-like structure using `xml.etree.ElementTree.Element`. It builds the tree by handling start tags, end tags, data, and entities.\n\n3. **Entities and Characters**: A basic implementation of handling HTML entities and character references is included.\n\n4. **Partial Document Handling**: The parser can handle partial documents by dealing with tags as they come, although it might not handle all edge cases of malformed HTML.\n\n5. **Limitations**: This approach doesn't support XPath directly. For XPath, you would typically need to use `lxml`, which isn't part of the standard library. Additionally, the handling of unclosed tags and deeply malformed HTML might not be perfect.\n\nThis example provides a foundational approach to parsing malformed HTML with Python's standard libraries, though for more robust and feature-complete solutions, third-party libraries are recommended."
