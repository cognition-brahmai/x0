The label (fan_growth) is calculated for each day, not for each post, meaning there is a single label against multiple instances. If I use one hot encoding for the categorical data, how can I use a single label against more than one instance? I'm unsure about using '100' against the first three instances, as it doesn't seem correct."

        "content": "To tackle this problem, you're essentially looking to predict a daily aggregate metric (fan growth) based on multiple posts made during that day. This is a somewhat common scenario where you have multiple instances (posts) contributing to a single label (daily fan growth).\n\nHere's a structured approach to design your model:\n\n1. **Aggregate Post Data**: Instead of treating each post as a separate instance with the same label, aggregate the features of all posts made in a day into a single instance. This means you'll transform your daily data into a single vector per day. Here are some ways to aggregate:\n\n   - **Numerical Features**: Sum, average, or use other statistics (e.g., max, min) for features like shares, likes, comments, etc.\n   - **Categorical Features**: You can sum the one-hot encoded vectors for each category. For instance, if you have three posts with categories [video, link, video] on a given day, your aggregated one-hot vector for categories could be [2, 1, 0] assuming the categories are one-hot encoded as [video, link, status].\n\n2. **Feature Engineering**: Consider additional features that might be helpful, such as the time of day of the posts, engagement rates (likes per post, comments per post), etc.\n\n3. **Neural Network Design**: Once you have your daily aggregated data, you can train a neural network on these daily instances. The input layer will match the size of your aggregated feature vector, and the output layer will predict the daily fan growth.\n\n4. **Handling Temporal Dependencies**: If your fan growth is influenced by time-dependent factors (e.g., trends over days), consider using models that can capture temporal dependencies like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs). Alternatively, if your data is more extensive, you could also explore using attention mechanisms or Transformers.\n\n5. **Validation**: Ensure you have a proper validation strategy, like time series split, to evaluate your model's performance over unseen data.\n\nThis approach ensures that your model learns from the collective impact of all posts made in a day, rather than treating each post independently with the same label, which would indeed be incorrect."
