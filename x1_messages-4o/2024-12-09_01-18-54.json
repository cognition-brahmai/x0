Currently, I use the `classification_report` function to evaluate the performance of my classifier. However, I'm interested in further analysis and want to obtain the per-class F1 score for each of the classes available. Is there a way in scikit-learn to do something like this:\n\n```python\nprint(calculate_f1_score(y_true, y_pred, target_class='class 0'))\n```\n\nwhich would return the F1 score for 'class 0'?\n\nHere's the current output of my `classification_report` function:\n\n```python\n>>> print(classification_report(y_true, y_pred, target_names=target_names))\n             precision    recall  f1-score   support\n\n    class 0       0.50      1.00      0.67         1\n    class 1       0.00      0.00      0.00         1\n    class 2       1.00      0.67      0.80         3\n\navg / total       0.70      0.60      0.61         5\n```"

        "content": "To obtain the per-class F1 score for a specific class using scikit-learn, you can do this by utilizing the `f1_score` function and specifying the `average` parameter as `'binary'` while indicating which class you want to focus on using the `pos_label` parameter. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.metrics import f1_score\n\n# Assuming y_true and y_pred are your true and predicted labels\n# and target_names is a list like ['class 0', 'class 1', 'class 2']\n\n# Mapping class names to their respective labels\nclass_to_label = {name: idx for idx, name in enumerate(target_names)}\n\n# Calculate F1 score for 'class 0'\nf1_class_0 = f1_score(y_true, y_pred, average='binary', pos_label=class_to_label['class 0'])\n\nprint(f\"F1 score for 'class 0': {f1_class_0:.2f}\")\n```\n\nThis approach assumes that your labels are encoded as integers and that you have a mapping of class names to these integer labels. \n\nIf your labels are already integers and correspond directly to the class indices, you can directly specify the `pos_label` as the integer representing 'class 0':\n\n```python\n# Assuming 'class 0' corresponds to the integer label 0\nf1_class_0 = f1_score(y_true, y_pred, average='binary', pos_label=0)\n\nprint(f\"F1 score for 'class 0': {f1_class_0:.2f}\")\n```\n\nThis will give you the F1 score for the specified class. If you have a multiclass problem (more than two classes), ensure that the other classes are treated as negative by setting `average='binary'`."
