However, I also need the original function to continue operating as normal. The instance of the class `b = B()` isn't actually located in the main function, it is in another module, so I can't mock the instance. Instead, I need it to be a decorator for all instances of B. How can I individually mock the class method on its own, but still call the original method? Additionally, I would like to use something like call_args_list to see all calls made to `foo()`."

        "content": "To achieve the goal of recording all function calls made to a method in a class while allowing the original method to continue operating as normal, you can use a combination of mocking and decorators. Specifically, you can use the `unittest.mock` module and the `patch` function to temporarily replace the method with a wrapper that records calls and then invokes the original method. Here\u2019s how you can implement this:\n\n1. **Create a Wrapper Function**: Define a wrapper function that will log the calls and then call the original method.\n\n2. **Use `unittest.mock.patch`**: Use the `patch` function to replace the target method with the wrapper function. The `patch` function can be used as a decorator or a context manager.\n\n3. **Collect Call Arguments**: Use `call_args_list` to collect all the calls made to the method.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom unittest.mock import patch, call\nimport unittest\n\n# Example class with the method you want to monitor\nclass B:\n    def foo(self, x, y):\n        # Original functionality\n        return x + y\n\n# Wrapper function to log calls and execute the original method\ndef log_calls(original_method):\n    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Record the call\n        wrapper.call_args_list.append(call(*args, **kwargs))\n        # Call the original method\n        return original_method(self, *args, **kwargs)\n    wrapper.call_args_list = []\n    return wrapper\n\n# Your test case\nclass TestB(unittest.TestCase):\n    def test_foo_calls(self):\n        with patch('__main__.B.foo', new=log_calls(B.foo)):\n            # Create an instance of B\n            b = B()\n            # Call the method\n            result1 = b.foo(1, 2)\n            result2 = b.foo(3, 4)\n\n            # Check the results of the original functionality\n            self.assertEqual(result1, 3)\n            self.assertEqual(result2, 7)\n\n            # Check the logged calls\n            expected_calls = [call(1, 2), call(3, 4)]\n            self.assertEqual(B.foo.call_args_list, expected_calls)\n\n# Run the test\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Wrapper Function**: The `log_calls` function wraps the original method, records its arguments, and then calls the original method.\n- **Patch with `new`**: The `patch` function is used to replace `B.foo` with the `log_calls` wrapper, allowing it to capture calls while maintaining the original functionality.\n- **Call Arguments**: `call_args_list` is used to store the arguments with which the method was called. This allows for later inspection in tests.\n- **Running the Test**: The test case demonstrates how to verify both the return values of the method and the captured call arguments.\n\nThis setup will allow you to track how many times and with what arguments the `foo` method was called while still executing the original method logic."
