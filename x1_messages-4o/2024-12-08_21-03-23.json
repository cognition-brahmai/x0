        "content": "To determine the country whose total population is divisible by 25 and whose population density is greater than 100 people per square kilometer, we need to consider countries with large populations and high population densities. One example that fits these criteria is Bangladesh. Bangladesh has a high population density and a total population that can be divisible by 25.\n\nAs for the country that has experienced a significant increase in its median age over the past ten years, Japan is a notable example. Japan has been experiencing an aging population with a significant rise in median age due to low birth rates and high life expectancy."
