I am trying to pass the exception information through a pipe, but it doesn't seem to work because traceback objects can't be pickled. Here is the code I've written so far:\n\n```python\ndef foo(pipe_to_parent):\n    try:\n        raise Exception('xxx')\n    except:\n        pipe_to_parent.send(sys.exc_info())\n\nto_child, to_self = multiprocessing.Pipe()\nprocess = multiprocessing.Process(target = foo, args = (to_self,))\nprocess.start()\nexc_info = to_child.recv()\nprocess.join()\nprint traceback.format_exception(*exc_info)\nto_child.close()\nto_self.close()\n```\n\nWhen I run this code, I get the following traceback:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.6/multiprocessing/process.py\", line 231, in _bootstrap\n    self.run()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.6/multiprocessing/process.py\", line 88, in run\n    self._target(*self._args, **self._kwargs)\n  File \"foo\", line 7, in foo\n    to_parent.send(sys.exc_info())\nPicklingError: Can't pickle <type 'traceback'>: attribute lookup __builtin__.traceback failed\n```\n\nIs there a different method to access the exception information? I'd prefer not to pass the formatted string."

        "content": "When working with `multiprocessing`, you need to be careful about what you send between processes, as many objects, including traceback objects, cannot be pickled directly. However, you can work around this limitation by serializing the exception information in a way that can be pickled and then reconstructing it in the parent process.\n\nOne approach is to capture the exception type, value, and traceback as a string. You can do this by using the `traceback` module to format the exception into a string and then send that string through the pipe. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport traceback\nimport multiprocessing\n\ndef foo(pipe_to_parent):\n    try:\n        raise Exception('xxx')\n    except:\n        exc_type, exc_value, exc_tb = sys.exc_info()\n        formatted_tb = traceback.format_exception(exc_type, exc_value, exc_tb)\n        pipe_to_parent.send((exc_type, exc_value, formatted_tb))\n\nto_child, to_self = multiprocessing.Pipe()\nprocess = multiprocessing.Process(target=foo, args=(to_self,))\nprocess.start()\nexc_type, exc_value, formatted_tb = to_child.recv()\nprocess.join()\n\n# Reconstruct and print the formatted traceback\nprint(''.join(formatted_tb))\n\nto_child.close()\nto_self.close()\n```\n\nHere's what the code does:\n\n1. In the `foo` function, it captures the exception information using `sys.exc_info()`.\n2. It formats the traceback into a string using `traceback.format_exception()`.\n3. It sends the exception type, value, and the formatted traceback as a tuple through the pipe.\n4. In the parent process, it receives these components and reconstructs the formatted traceback.\n5. Finally, it prints the traceback.\n\nThis approach allows you to bypass the pickling issue by converting the traceback into a string representation that can be safely sent between processes."
