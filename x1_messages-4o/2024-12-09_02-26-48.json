My inputs are tuples of an integer and a float. The code is executing successfully, but I am having trouble implementing a loading bar using 'tqdm'. While I am able to use 'tqdm' with the 'imap' method, I am unsure of how to do the same with 'starmap'. How can I implement 'tqdm' with 'starmap'?\n\nCode:\n\n```python\nwith mp.Pool(8) as tmpPool:\n    results = tmpPool.starmap(my_function, inputs)\n```\n\nWhere inputs look like:\n    [(1,0.2312),(5,0.52) ...]\n\nAnd for 'imap' I am able to use 'tqdm' as follows:\n\n```python\ntqdm.tqdm(mp.imap(some_function,some_inputs))\n```"

        "content": "To use `tqdm` with `starmap`, you can manually iterate through the results and update the progress bar. Since `starmap` returns a list directly and does not support lazy evaluation like `imap`, you need to wrap the process to update the progress bar.\n\nHere's how you can implement it:\n\n1. Iterate over the indices of the inputs.\n2. Update the progress bar in each iteration.\n3. Collect the results in a list.\n\nBelow is the modified code that integrates `tqdm` with `starmap`:\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing as mp\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\n\ndef my_function(x, y):\n    # Your function implementation here\n    return x + y  # Example operation\n\n# Example inputs\ninputs = [(1, 0.2312), (5, 0.52), (3, 0.33), (2, 0.75)]\n\nwith mp.Pool(8) as tmpPool:\n    # Use tqdm to create a progress bar\n    results = []\n    for i, result in tqdm(enumerate(tmpPool.starmap(my_function, inputs)), total=len(inputs)):\n        results.append(result)\n\n# Now 'results' contains the output of 'my_function' applied to each tuple in 'inputs'\nprint(results)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The `tqdm` progress bar is created using `enumerate` to iterate over the results returned by `starmap`.\n- The `total` parameter of `tqdm` is set to the length of the `inputs`, so it knows how many iterations to expect.\n- In each iteration, the result of the function is appended to the `results` list.\n- This approach allows you to see the progress of the computation as it processes each element from the `inputs` list.\n\nThis method ensures you can track the progress of each task in the `starmap` method while collecting the results."
