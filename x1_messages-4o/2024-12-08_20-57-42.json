        "content": "Retrieving the name of the Earth's layer that separates the lithosphere and the mantle is more of a scientific question rather than a technical one that can be solved by an API or library in Swift. The boundary you're referring to is known as the \"Mohorovi\u010di\u0107 discontinuity,\" or \"Moho\" for short.\n\nIn the context of a Swift app, if you want to display this information, you don't need to perform calculations or use a specific API for geophysical data. Instead, you can simply hardcode the information or retrieve it from a local or remote database if you are building an educational application. Here's a basic example of how you might represent this information in a Swift app:\n\n```swift\nimport UIKit\n\nclass ViewController: UIViewController {\n    \n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n        \n        // Retrieve the name of the boundary layer\n        let boundaryLayerName = getBoundaryLayerName()\n        \n        // Display the name in a label\n        let layerLabel = UILabel()\n        layerLabel.text = \"The boundary layer is called: \\(boundaryLayerName)\"\n        layerLabel.textAlignment = .center\n        layerLabel.numberOfLines = 0\n        layerLabel.frame = CGRect(x: 20, y: 100, width: self.view.frame.width - 40, height: 100)\n        self.view.addSubview(layerLabel)\n    }\n    \n    func getBoundaryLayerName() -> String {\n        return \"Mohorovi\u010di\u0107 discontinuity (Moho)\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `getBoundaryLayerName` function simply returns the name of the boundary layer, which is then displayed in a `UILabel`. This is a straightforward approach because the name of this geological layer is a fact and doesn't change based on calculations or external data.\n\nIf you were dealing with a more complex scenario, such as visualizing geological data or simulating geophysical processes, you might consider integrating scientific libraries or APIs that provide geological data. However, for simply retrieving and displaying the name of an Earth layer, hardcoding the information is sufficient."
