Here's an expanded version of the JSON data with some well-known examples, including the classic taxicab number 1729, which was famously noted by mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"results\": [\n        {\n            \"number\": 1729,\n            \"expression1\": \"1^3 + 12^3\",\n            \"expression2\": \"9^3 + 10^3\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"number\": 4104,\n            \"expression1\": \"2^3 + 16^3\",\n            \"expression2\": \"9^3 + 15^3\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"number\": 13832,\n            \"expression1\": \"2^3 + 24^3\",\n            \"expression2\": \"18^3 + 20^3\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"number\": 20683,\n            \"expression1\": \"10^3 + 27^3\",\n            \"expression2\": \"19^3 + 24^3\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"number\": 39312,\n            \"expression1\": \"2^3 + 34^3\",\n            \"expression2\": \"15^3 + 33^3\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"number\": 40033,\n            \"expression1\": \"9^3 + 34^3\",\n            \"expression2\": \"16^3 + 33^3\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON data lists some of the smallest taxicab numbers along with their expressions as sums of two cubes. Note that this list is not exhaustive, and there are more such numbers. The order of the summands is considered different in these expressions."
