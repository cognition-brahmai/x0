All three have the `execute` method, and I can use them interchangeably to select all records from a table. For example, I can use `engine.execute(select([table])).fetchall()`, `connection.execute(select([table])).fetchall()`, and `session.execute(select([table])).fetchall()`, and the results will be the same. From my understanding, using `engine.execute` creates a `connection`, opens a `session` (with SQLAlchemy taking care of it), and executes the query. But is there a global difference between these three ways of performing such a task?"

        "content": "In SQLAlchemy, `engine`, `connection`, and `session` are distinct entities, each serving different roles in the context of database interaction, even though they might seem interchangeable at times due to their ability to execute SQL statements. Here's a breakdown of the differences:\n\n1. **Engine**:\n   - The `engine` is the starting point for any SQLAlchemy application that interacts with a database. It is a factory that can create database connections and manage connection pooling. \n   - When you call `engine.execute()`, it internally creates a connection, executes the statement, and then closes the connection unless you explicitly manage the connection.\n   - The engine itself does not maintain any state about the transactions or results beyond the scope of a single execution. It's more of a low-level construct.\n\n2. **Connection**:\n   - A `connection` is a database connection associated with a specific `engine`. It represents an active connection to the database and is responsible for executing statements and handling transactions.\n   - Using a `connection` allows for more fine-grained control over transaction management, as you can explicitly begin, commit, or rollback transactions.\n   - The lifecycle of a `connection` is typically shorter than that of an `engine`, and it's often used for executing individual statements or small batches of statements.\n\n3. **Session**:\n   - A `session` is a higher-level construct that provides an interface for interacting with the database in a more ORM-like fashion. It maintains a cache of objects and tracks changes to them.\n   - The `session` is designed to manage the lifecycle of objects you retrieve from the database, including persisting changes and handling transactions.\n   - While you can use `session.execute()` to run raw SQL or Core expressions, the primary purpose of a session is to work with ORM-mapped objects.\n   - Sessions are typically used for unit-of-work patterns, where a session represents a series of operations that should be executed within a single transaction.\n\nIn summary, while all three can execute SQL, they are intended for different use cases:\n- Use `engine` for low-level, one-off operations or when you need to manage connections manually.\n- Use `connection` when you need explicit control over transactions or when executing multiple statements in a controlled manner.\n- Use `session` for ORM operations, object lifecycle management, and when you need to manage transactional boundaries implicitly."
