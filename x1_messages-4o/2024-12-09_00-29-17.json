        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to incorrect usage of the `train_test_split` function. The third parameter in the `train_test_split` function should be specified as a keyword argument, such as `test_size`, rather than a positional argument.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split \n\n# Sample dataframe (replace with your actual dataframe)\n# df = pd.DataFrame(...) \n\nX = df.iloc[:, [1, 7]].values\ny = df.iloc[:, -1].values\n\n# Correct usage of train_test_split\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **test_size**: This parameter should be specified to indicate the proportion of the dataset to include in the test split. Here, it's set to `0.2`, meaning 20% of the data will be used for testing.\n- **random_state**: It's a good practice to provide a `random_state` to ensure reproducibility.\n\nThis should resolve the `TypeError` and allow your code to run correctly."
