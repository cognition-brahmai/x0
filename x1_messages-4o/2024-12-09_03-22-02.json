However, as I upgraded some packages, some dependencies are no longer needed or required but they keep being listed by pip freeze. I would like to set up a new virtual environment where I can install the required packages along with their dependencies from a requirement file, and freeze the full virtual environment. How can I do this without manually re-installing the packages in a new virtual environment to get their dependencies? \n\nHere is the list of packages I need to install:\n\n```\nDjango==1.3.1\n--extra-index-url=http://dist.pinaxproject.com/dev/\nPinax==0.9b1.dev10\ngit+git://github.com/pinax/pinax-theme-bootstrap.git@cff4f5bbe9f87f0c67ee9ada9aa8ae82978f9890\n# and other packages\n```\n\nAnd here is how I'd like to set up my new virtual environment:\n\n1. Put the needed packages (without their dependencies) in a requirement file, like `manual-requirements.txt`\n2. Install them with their dependencies using `pip install -r manual-requirement.txt` (but this does not install the dependencies)\n3. Freeze the full virtualenv using `pip freeze -r manual-requirements.txt > full-requirements.txt` and deploy."

        "content": "To set up a new virtual environment and install your packages along with their dependencies, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create a New Virtual Environment:**\n\n   First, make sure you have `virtualenv` installed. If not, you can install it using `pip`:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install virtualenv\n   ```\n\n   Then create a new virtual environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   virtualenv myenv\n   ```\n\n   Activate the virtual environment:\n\n   - On Windows:\n\n     ```bash\n     myenv\\Scripts\\activate\n     ```\n\n   - On macOS and Linux:\n\n     ```bash\n     source myenv/bin/activate\n     ```\n\n2. **Create a `manual-requirements.txt` File:**\n\n   This file should contain the packages you want to install without specifying their dependencies. Here is an example based on the packages you provided:\n\n   ```plaintext\n   Django==1.3.1\n   --extra-index-url=http://dist.pinaxproject.com/dev/\n   Pinax==0.9b1.dev10\n   git+git://github.com/pinax/pinax-theme-bootstrap.git@cff4f5bbe9f87f0c67ee9ada9aa8ae82978f9890\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Packages with Their Dependencies:**\n\n   Now, use the `pip install` command to install the packages along with their dependencies:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r manual-requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n   This command will read the `manual-requirements.txt` file and install the specified packages along with their dependencies.\n\n4. **Freeze the Full Virtual Environment:**\n\n   After you have installed the packages and their dependencies, you can freeze the entire virtual environment to a `full-requirements.txt` file:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip freeze > full-requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n   This `full-requirements.txt` file will contain all the installed packages and their specific versions, which can be used for deployment.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively manage dependencies in your Django web app, ensuring that only the necessary packages are included in your environment."
