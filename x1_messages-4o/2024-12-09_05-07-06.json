However, I've noticed that the `split()` method removes all the '>' delimiters. How can I modify my code so that the `split()` method doesn't remove the delimiters? For example, the string `<html><head>` turns into `['<html', '<head']` but I want it to be `['<html>', '<head>']`.\n\nHere is the code snippet for reference:\n```python\nfor line in all_lines:\n    s = line.split('>')\n```"

        "content": "To achieve the desired output where the '>' delimiters are retained in the split parts, you can use regular expressions with the `re` module instead of the `split()` method. By using capturing groups in the `re.split()` function, you can keep the delimiters in the resulting list. Here's an example of how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nfor line in all_lines:\n    # Use a regular expression to split the line and keep the delimiters\n    s = re.split(r'(>+)', line)\n\n    # Join each part with the delimiter to form the complete tags\n    s = [part + '>' for part in s if part]\n\n    print(s)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Regular Expression**: The `re.split(r'(>+)', line)` function is used to split the string at each '>' while capturing the delimiter. The parentheses `()` around `>+` create a capturing group, causing the `>` characters to be included in the resulting list.\n\n2. **List Comprehension**: After splitting, we use a list comprehension to iterate over the parts and append the '>' back to each part, ensuring that each part forms a complete tag.\n\n3. **Filtering**: The `if part` condition in the list comprehension filters out any empty strings that might result from consecutive delimiters.\n\nThis method will give you the desired output where each part is a complete tag, including the '>' delimiter."
