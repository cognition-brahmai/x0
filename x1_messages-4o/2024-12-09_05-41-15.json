        "content": "Certainly! The `continue` statement is useful when you want to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move on to the next iteration. It can be especially handy for skipping over certain items that meet a specific condition.\n\nHere's a simple example using a `for` loop to iterate through a list of numbers and print only the odd numbers:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\nfor number in numbers:\n    if number % 2 == 0:\n        continue  # Skip the rest of the loop for even numbers\n    print(number)\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The loop iterates over each number in the `numbers` list.\n- The `if` statement checks if the number is even (`number % 2 == 0`).\n- If it is even, the `continue` statement is executed, which skips the rest of the loop body for that iteration and continues with the next iteration.\n- As a result, only odd numbers are printed.\n\nThis way, the `continue` statement helps you avoid executing certain parts of the loop's body when you know you don't need to process some items based on specific conditions."
