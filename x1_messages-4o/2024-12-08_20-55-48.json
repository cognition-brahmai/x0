The catch is that the currency symbol is encoded in a base64 format and is stored in the \"symbol\" key. Can you extract the currency symbol using Python code snippet after decoding it? \nBut wait, there's more! The currency symbol can either be a single letter or a combination of letters. To make things more interesting, I will only give you a hint about the symbol: The symbol consists of only letters from the English alphabet and is of length between 1 to 4 letters. Can you crack this puzzle?"

        "content": "Sure! Let's solve this puzzle by decoding the base64-encoded currency symbol from the JSON data. Here's a Python code snippet that does exactly that:\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport base64\n\n# Example JSON data with base64-encoded currency symbol\ndata = '''\n{\n    \"country\": \"ExampleCountry\",\n    \"currency\": \"ExampleCurrency\",\n    \"symbol\": \"U1BFA\"  # This is just an example; replace it with the actual base64 string\n}\n'''\n\n# Load the JSON data\ncurrency_info = json.loads(data)\n\n# Extract the base64-encoded symbol\nencoded_symbol = currency_info[\"symbol\"]\n\n# Decode the base64-encoded symbol\ndecoded_bytes = base64.b64decode(encoded_symbol)\ndecoded_symbol = decoded_bytes.decode('utf-8')\n\n# Print the decoded currency symbol\nprint(f\"The decoded currency symbol is: {decoded_symbol}\")\n```\n\nReplace `U1BFA` in the `symbol` key with your actual base64 string. The code will decode the symbol and print it out. The decoding process assumes that the symbol is encoded using base64 and contains only letters from the English alphabet. Let me know if you have the actual base64 string, and I can help you decode it further!"
