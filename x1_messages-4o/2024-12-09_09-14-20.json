Here is a straightforward approach in pseudocode:\n\n```\nAlgorithm Max(a, b):\n    if a > b then\n        return a\n    else\n        return b\n```\n\nThis algorithm checks if \\(a\\) is greater than \\(b\\). If true, it returns \\(a\\); otherwise, it returns \\(b\\). This is a basic comparison operation that can be implemented in most programming languages using an `if` statement or a similar construct."
