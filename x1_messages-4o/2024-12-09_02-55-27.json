I have created a function to achieve this but I'm wondering if there is a more efficient way, perhaps a built-in function in numpy, to do this? I am working with Big Data so efficiency is crucial. Here's the code I wrote:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef numberOfNonNans(data):\n    count = 0\n    for i in data:\n        if not np.isnan(i):\n            count += 1\n    return count \n```\n\nIs there a more efficient way to achieve this using numpy?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this more efficiently using NumPy's built-in functions. Instead of iterating over each element in the array and checking if it is NaN, you can use the `np.isnan()` function along with `np.sum()` to count the number of non-NaN elements in a more vectorized and efficient manner. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef numberOfNonNans(data):\n    return np.sum(~np.isnan(data))\n\n# Example usage:\ndata = np.array([[1, 2, np.nan], [4, np.nan, 6]])\ncount = numberOfNonNans(data)\nprint(count)  # Output will be 4\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `np.isnan(data)` creates a boolean array where each element is `True` if the corresponding element in `data` is NaN and `False` otherwise.\n- `~np.isnan(data)` inverts this boolean array, making `True` for non-NaN elements.\n- `np.sum()` then counts the number of `True` values in this inverted boolean array, effectively counting the number of non-NaN elements.\n\nThis approach is much more efficient, especially for large datasets, because it leverages NumPy's optimized internal routines for array operations."
