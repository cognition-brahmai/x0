By empathizing with users, teams can generate more innovative solutions that are more likely to meet the actual needs and preferences of the target audience.\n\n2. **Improved Collaboration and Creativity**: By promoting a collaborative and iterative process, design thinking fosters creativity and teamwork. It brings together diverse perspectives and disciplines, encouraging open-mindedness and experimentation. This can lead to more creative problem-solving and more effective solutions."
