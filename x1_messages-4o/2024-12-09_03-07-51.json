The code I've written is as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom xml.etree.ElementTree import ElementTree\nfrom xml.etree.ElementTree import Element\nfrom xml.etree.ElementTree import SubElement\nimport xml.etree.ElementTree as ET\n\nroot = Element('QuoteWerksXML')\ntree = ElementTree(root)\nver = SubElement(root, \"AppVersionMajor\")\nver.text = '5.1'\n\ntree.write(open('person.xml', 'w'))\n```\n\nWhy am I getting a TypeError here and how can I resolve this issue?"

    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The `TypeError` you're encountering is likely due to the use of the `open` function without specifying the mode for writing binary data. The `ElementTree.write()` method expects a file object opened in binary mode, not text mode. When you open a file using `open('person.xml', 'w')`, it's opened in text mode, which can cause issues with the encoding.\n\nTo fix this, you should open the file in binary mode by using `'wb'` instead of `'w'`. Here's the corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nfrom xml.etree.ElementTree import ElementTree, Element, SubElement\n\nroot = Element('QuoteWerksXML')\ntree = ElementTree(root)\nver = SubElement(root, \"AppVersionMajor\")\nver.text = '5.1'\n\n# Open the file in binary write mode\nwith open('person.xml', 'wb') as f:\n    tree.write(f, encoding='utf-8', xml_declaration=True)\n```\n\nAdditionally, it's a good practice to specify the encoding (like `'utf-8'`) and to include `xml_declaration=True` in the `write` method to ensure that your XML file has a proper XML declaration at the top, which can be important for compatibility with various XML parsers. Using a `with` statement for opening the file also ensures that the file is properly closed after writing."
