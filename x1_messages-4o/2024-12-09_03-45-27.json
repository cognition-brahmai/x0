Earlier, I had the issue of 'cl.exe' not being found, which I resolved by adding the Visual Studio path to the environment variables where cl.exe exists. Now, I'm getting errors like 'Failed building wheel for spacy', 'Failed building wheel for murmurhash', 'Failed building wheel for preshed' and so on. How can I resolve this issue?\n\nHere are the errors I'm seeing:\n\n```\nFailed building wheel for spacy\nRunning setup.py clean for spacy\nRunning setup.py bdist_wheel for murmurhash ... error\nFailed building wheel for murmurhash\nRunning setup.py clean for murmurhash\nRunning setup.py bdist_wheel for cymem ... error\nFailed building wheel for cymem\nRunning setup.py clean for cymem\nRunning setup.py bdist_wheel for preshed ... error\nFailed building wheel for preshed\nRunning setup.py clean for preshed\nRunning setup.py bdist_wheel for thinc ... error\nFailed building wheel for thinc\nRunning setup.py clean for thinc\nRunning setup.py bdist_wheel for ujson ... error\nFailed building wheel for ujson\nRunning setup.py clean for ujson\nRunning setup.py bdist_wheel for cytoolz ... error\nFailed building wheel for cytoolz\nRunning setup.py clean for cytoolz\nFailed to build spacy murmurhash cymem preshed thinc ujson cytoolz\nInstalling collected packages: murmurhash, cymem, preshed, wrapt, tqdm, toolz, cytoolz, plac, pyreadline, dill, termcolor, pathlib, thinc, ujson, regex, spacy\nRunning setup.py install for murmurhash ... error\n```\n\nAnd the error for murmurhash is:\n\n```\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\\VC\\bin\\cl.exe /c /nologo /Ox /W3 /GL /DNDEBUG /MD -Ic:\\users\\sh00428701\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python36\\include -IC:\\Users\\SH0042~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\pip-build-joi6voav\\murmurhash\\murmurhash\\include -Ic:\\users\\sh00428701\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python36\\include -Ic:\\users\\sh00428701\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python36\\include /EHsc /Tpmurmurhash/mrmr.cpp /Fobuild\\temp.win-amd64-3.6\\Release\\murmurhash/mrmr.obj /Ox /EHsc\nmrmr.cpp\nc1xx: fatal error C1083: Cannot open source file: 'murmurhash/mrmr.cpp': No such file or directory\nerror: command 'C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\\\\VC\\\\bin\\\\cl.exe' failed with exit status 2\n```"

        "content": "The issues you're encountering are quite common when trying to install Python packages with C extensions on Windows, especially with older Python versions like 3.6.1. Here are a few steps you can follow to try and resolve these issues:\n\n1. **Upgrade Python**: Python 3.6.1 is quite old, and some packages might not support it well. Consider upgrading to a more recent version of Python, such as 3.8 or 3.9. Make sure to also update `pip` and `setuptools`:\n   ```bash\n   python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Wheel**: Ensure you have the `wheel` package installed, which can help with building binary wheels:\n   ```bash\n   pip install wheel\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Microsoft Build Tools**: If you haven't already, install the Microsoft C++ Build Tools, which includes the compilers needed for building Python extensions:\n   - Download and install the [Visual C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).\n   - During installation, make sure to select \"C++ Build Tools\" which includes the \"Windows 10 SDK\" and \"C++ x64/x86 build tools\".\n\n4. **Use Precompiled Binaries**: Sometimes, you can find precompiled binaries (.whl files) for your platform which can be installed without compiling from source. You can check sites like [Gohlke's Python Extension Packages](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) for a `.whl` file for your package, if available.\n\n5. **Install Dependencies Manually**: You can try installing the dependencies individually to see if there\u2019s a specific one causing issues. Sometimes, installing dependencies one by one can help identify and resolve errors:\n   ```bash\n   pip install murmurhash cymem preshed thinc ujson cytoolz\n   ```\n\n6. **Use a Virtual Environment**: It's always a good practice to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects and system-wide packages:\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv myenv\n   myenv\\Scripts\\activate  # On Windows\n   # or\n   source myenv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux\n   ```\n\n7. **Package Compatibility**: Check the compatibility of the versions of the packages you are trying to install with Python 3.6.1. Sometimes, a specific version of a package may have issues with older Python versions.\n\nAfter following these steps, try installing `spacy` again with `pip install spacy`. If issues persist, upgrading Python is often the most straightforward way to resolve compatibility problems with newer packages."
