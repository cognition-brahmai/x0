By default, `pip` only installs stable versions, which are generally more reliable and have undergone more rigorous testing. However, there are situations where you may want to work with a pre-release version, such as when you need to test new features or compatibility before the stable version is released.\n\nIn the command `pip install neo4j-doc-manager --pre`, the `--pre` flag tells `pip` that you are willing to accept pre-release versions of the `neo4j-doc-manager` package if they are available. This can be useful if the stable version does not yet include features or fixes that you need, but are available in a newer pre-release version."
