However, when I switched to NumPy, I found that \"*\" does not perform matrix multiplication and instead, I need to use the function matrixmultipy(), which makes the code less readable. Is there anyone who shares my views and has found a solution?"

        "content": "In NumPy, the distinction between arrays and matrices can indeed be a bit confusing at first, especially if you're coming from a background in Octave or MATLAB, where the `*` operator inherently performs matrix multiplication.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how multiplication works with NumPy's `ndarray` (the array class) and the `matrix` class:\n\n1. **NumPy Arrays (`ndarray`)**:\n   - When you use the `*` operator between two `ndarray` objects, it performs element-wise multiplication, not matrix multiplication.\n   - To perform matrix multiplication with `ndarray`s, you should use the `@` operator or the `numpy.dot()` function. As of Python 3.5, the `@` operator is the preferred way for matrix multiplication, which makes the code more readable than using functions.\n   - Example:\n     ```python\n     import numpy as np\n     \n     A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n     B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\n     \n     # Element-wise multiplication\n     elementwise_product = A * B\n     \n     # Matrix multiplication\n     matrix_product = A @ B  # or np.dot(A, B)\n     ```\n\n2. **NumPy Matrices (`matrix`)**:\n   - The `matrix` class is a subclass of `ndarray` that overrides the `*` operator to perform matrix multiplication.\n   - If you prefer the behavior where `*` performs matrix multiplication, you can use the `matrix` class. However, it's generally recommended to use `ndarray` because the `matrix` class is being gradually deprecated and lacks some features of `ndarray`.\n   - Example:\n     ```python\n     import numpy as np\n     \n     A = np.matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n     B = np.matrix([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\n     \n     # Matrix multiplication using *\n     matrix_product = A * B\n     ```\n\n**Solution**:\nIf you want your code to be more readable and similar to Octave, you can consistently use the `@` operator for matrix multiplication when working with `ndarray`. This helps maintain readability and clarity in your code, aligning with the behavior you expect from Octave. Moreover, sticking to `ndarray` ensures compatibility with a wider range of NumPy functionalities and future updates.\n\nIf you absolutely prefer using `*` for matrix multiplication, you could use the `matrix` class, but keep in mind the potential limitations and deprecation of this class in future versions of NumPy."
