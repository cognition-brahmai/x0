        "content": "Sure, let's tackle this puzzle step by step.\n\n### Java Code for SSL/TLS Communication\n\nTo create a secure client-server communication using SSL/TLS in Java, you'll need to set up both server and client code. Below is a simplified version of how you might achieve this. Note that this is a basic example, and in a real-world scenario, you'd need to handle certificates and key management more robustly.\n\n#### Server Code\n\n```java\nimport javax.net.ssl.*;\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.security.KeyStore;\n\npublic class SSLServer {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            // Load server's key store containing the server's private key\n            KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(\"JKS\");\n            keyStore.load(new FileInputStream(\"server.jks\"), \"password\".toCharArray());\n\n            // Initialize key manager factory with the server's key store\n            KeyManagerFactory keyManagerFactory = KeyManagerFactory.getInstance(\"SunX509\");\n            keyManagerFactory.init(keyStore, \"password\".toCharArray());\n\n            // Initialize SSL context with key manager\n            SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance(\"TLS\");\n            sslContext.init(keyManagerFactory.getKeyManagers(), null, null);\n\n            // Create SSL server socket\n            SSLServerSocketFactory sslServerSocketFactory = sslContext.getServerSocketFactory();\n            SSLServerSocket sslServerSocket = (SSLServerSocket) sslServerSocketFactory.createServerSocket(12345);\n\n            System.out.println(\"SSL Server started and waiting for client connection...\");\n            SSLSocket sslSocket = (SSLSocket) sslServerSocket.accept();\n\n            // Handle communication\n            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(sslSocket.getInputStream()));\n            PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(sslSocket.getOutputStream(), true);\n\n            String line;\n            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\n                System.out.println(\"Received: \" + line);\n                writer.println(\"Echo: \" + line);\n            }\n\n            sslSocket.close();\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Client Code\n\n```java\nimport javax.net.ssl.*;\nimport java.io.*;\n\npublic class SSLClient {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            // Load client's trust store containing the server's public key\n            KeyStore trustStore = KeyStore.getInstance(\"JKS\");\n            trustStore.load(new FileInputStream(\"client.jks\"), \"password\".toCharArray());\n\n            // Initialize trust manager factory with the client's trust store\n            TrustManagerFactory trustManagerFactory = TrustManagerFactory.getInstance(\"SunX509\");\n            trustManagerFactory.init(trustStore);\n\n            // Initialize SSL context with trust manager\n            SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance(\"TLS\");\n            sslContext.init(null, trustManagerFactory.getTrustManagers(), null);\n\n            // Create SSL socket and connect to server\n            SSLSocketFactory sslSocketFactory = sslContext.getSocketFactory();\n            SSLSocket sslSocket = (SSLSocket) sslSocketFactory.createSocket(\"localhost\", 12345);\n\n            // Handle communication\n            PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(sslSocket.getOutputStream(), true);\n            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(sslSocket.getInputStream()));\n\n            writer.println(\"Hello, Secure World!\");\n            System.out.println(\"Received from server: \" + reader.readLine());\n\n            sslSocket.close();\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Network Security Protocols\n\nHere are three common network security protocols that can be used to establish a secure connection between two devices:\n\n1. **TLS (Transport Layer Security):** This protocol provides privacy and data integrity between two communicating applications. It is widely used in web browsers, email clients, and other applications.\n\n2. **IPsec (Internet Protocol Security):** A suite of protocols designed to secure Internet Protocol (IP) communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet within a communication session.\n\n3. **SSH (Secure Shell):** A protocol for securely accessing and managing network devices and servers over an unsecured network.\n\nThese protocols help ensure that data transmitted over a network remains confidential and protected from unauthorized access."
