However, my program takes a considerable amount of time to execute, around 10 hours, as it is reading distinct words from a corpus. Upon completion of the reading process, I encounter a timeout error. The default MySQL timeouts were found to be as listed in the table below.

        "content": "To change the default MySQL timeouts, you can adjust the settings either at the server level or for your session. Here are several methods to modify these timeouts:\n\n### At the MySQL Server Level\n\n1. **Edit the `my.cnf` or `my.ini` File:**\n   - Locate the MySQL configuration file, typically named `my.cnf` on Linux or `my.ini` on Windows.\n   - Add or modify the timeout settings under the `[mysqld]` section. For example:\n     ```ini\n     [mysqld]\n     connect_timeout=60\n     net_read_timeout=120\n     net_write_timeout=120\n     wait_timeout=28800\n     ```\n   - Restart the MySQL server to apply the changes.\n\n2. **Using MySQL Command Line:**\n   - Connect to your MySQL server using a command-line client.\n   - Use the `SET GLOBAL` command to change the timeout values. For example:\n     ```sql\n     SET GLOBAL connect_timeout=60;\n     SET GLOBAL net_read_timeout=120;\n     SET GLOBAL net_write_timeout=120;\n     ```\n\n   Note that changes made via the command line will be lost upon server restart unless they are also specified in the configuration file.\n\n### At the Session Level\n\nYou can change timeout settings for your current session using the `SET` command. This won't affect other sessions or persist after disconnecting:\n\n```sql\nSET SESSION connect_timeout=60;\nSET SESSION net_read_timeout=120;\nSET SESSION net_write_timeout=120;\n```\n\n### In Your Python Code\n\nIf you want to set these timeouts directly in your Python code, you can specify them when establishing the connection, assuming you are using a library like `mysql.connector` or `PyMySQL`. Here's an example using `mysql.connector`:\n\n```python\nimport mysql.connector\n\ncon = mysql.connector.connect(\n    host='localhost',\n    user='dell-pc',\n    password='',\n    database='test',\n    connection_timeout=60,\n    read_timeout=120,\n    write_timeout=120,\n)\n```\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Optimize Your Code:** If possible, optimize your code to reduce execution time. Reading and processing data in batches or optimizing queries can significantly reduce the load time.\n- **Increase Resources:** Ensure your server has adequate resources and consider indexing your database tables if not already done to speed up query execution.\n\nBy adjusting these settings and optimizing your approach, you should be able to mitigate timeout errors while processing your data."
