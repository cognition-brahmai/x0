        "content": "To prevent adding a duplicate `follow_role` record in the database, you can use the `get_or_create()` method provided by Django's ORM. This method attempts to get an object from the database if it exists, and if it doesn't, it creates a new one. However, if you specifically want to check for existence without creating a new one if it doesn't exist, you can use the `exists()` method in conjunction with a filter query.\n\nHere's how you can do it using both methods:\n\n### Method 1: Using `get_or_create()`\nThis method will ensure that you either get an existing object or create a new one if it doesn't exist, which can be useful if you're okay with creating it if it doesn't exist.\n\n```python\ncurrent_user = request.user\nfollow_role, created = UserToUserRole.objects.get_or_create(\n    from_user=current_user,\n    to_user=user,\n    role='follow'\n)\nif created:\n    print(\"A new follow_role was created\")\nelse:\n    print(\"follow_role already exists\")\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using `filter()` and `exists()`\nIf you want to simply check for existence and do nothing if the object already exists, you can do this:\n\n```python\ncurrent_user = request.user\nexists = UserToUserRole.objects.filter(\n    from_user=current_user,\n    to_user=user,\n    role='follow'\n).exists()\n\nif not exists:\n    follow_role = UserToUserRole(from_user=current_user, to_user=user, role='follow')\n    follow_role.save()\n    print(\"follow_role was added to the database\")\nelse:\n    print(\"follow_role already exists in the database\")\n```\n\nThis approach avoids hitting the database twice unnecessarily and makes your code more efficient by directly checking for existence and saving only if needed."
