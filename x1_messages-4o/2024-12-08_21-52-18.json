The numbers do not consistently increase, as 18 is less than 32, which comes before it.\n\n3. **22, 18, 27, 33, 45** - This set is also not in ascending order, as 18 comes after 22, which is incorrect for ascending order.\n\nTherefore, the first set, **17, 25, 39, 46, 53**, is the one that is arranged in ascending order."
