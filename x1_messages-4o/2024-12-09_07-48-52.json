The script is as follows:\n\n```python\nif True:\n    if False:\n        print('foo')\n   print('bar')\n```\n\nWhen I try to run this script, Python throws an `IndentationError`:\n\n```python\n  File \"script.py\", line 4\n    print('bar')\n               ^\nIndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level\n```\n\nIn the process of trying to fix this issue, I've come across four different types of errors:\n\n- `IndentationError: unexpected indent`\n- `IndentationError: expected an indented block`\n- `TabError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation`\n- `IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level`\n\nWhat do these errors mean and how can I rectify them?"

        "content": "The errors you're encountering are related to Python's strict indentation rules. Let's go through each error type and discuss what it means and how you can fix it:\n\n1. **IndentationError: unexpected indent**: This occurs when there is an unexpected indentation at a line where none is needed. For example, if you indent a line that should be at the top level of the code block without any reason, you'll get this error.\n\n   **Fix**: Ensure that the indentation is only applied to lines that are part of a block, such as lines within a function, loop, or conditional statement.\n\n2. **IndentationError: expected an indented block**: This error happens when a block of code is expected after a statement, but none is provided. For example, after an `if`, `for`, or `while` statement, Python expects the subsequent block to be indented.\n\n   **Fix**: Make sure to indent the lines of code that should be executed as part of the block immediately following the control statement.\n\n3. **TabError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation**: This error is raised when both tabs and spaces are used inconsistently to create indentation. Python treats tabs and spaces differently, and mixing them can lead to confusion.\n\n   **Fix**: Choose either tabs or spaces for indentation and stick with it throughout your script. The Python community suggests using 4 spaces per indentation level.\n\n4. **IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level**: This error occurs when a line is unindented incorrectly. It suggests that the level of indentation does not match any previous indentation level in the code block.\n\n   **Fix**: Check the indentation of the unindented line and ensure it matches a previous indentation level within the same block. All lines in the same block should have consistent indentation.\n\nIn your script, the error is due to inconsistent indentation on the line `print('bar')`. Here's how you can fix it:\n\n```python\nif True:\n    if False:\n        print('foo')\n    print('bar')  # Correct indentation\n```\n\nEnsure that `print('bar')` aligns with the `if False:` block, as it should be at the same indentation level as the first `if` block, making it part of the outer `if True:` block. This should resolve the `IndentationError` you're encountering."
