        "content": "In Django, you can check if any entry exists for a specific query using the `exists()` method on a QuerySet. This method is efficient because it does not retrieve all the objects from the database; it simply checks whether at least one object matches the query.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to check if any `scorm` entries exist for the given query:\n\n```python\nif scorm.objects.filter(Header__id=qp.id).exists():\n    # True condition\n    print(\"Entries exist for the given query.\")\nelse:\n    # False condition\n    print(\"No entries found for the given query.\")\n```\n\nThe `exists()` method returns `True` if the QuerySet contains any results, and `False` otherwise. This approach is similar to the `mysql_num_rows` function in PHP, but it is more efficient in Django as it avoids loading the entire result set into memory."
