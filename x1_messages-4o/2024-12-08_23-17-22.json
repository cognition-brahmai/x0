The function should not rely on any built-in functions or libraries that can directly achieve this objective. Please provide a detailed explanation of the algorithm used in the function, highlighting its complexity and performance metrics.\nHere is an example input array and an array of indices to remove:\nlet inputArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\nlet indicesToRemove = [1, 3, 4]\nThe expected output after removing the elements corresponding to the indices in the indicesToRemove array should be:\n[1, 3, 6, 7]\nTo achieve this, you can iterate through the indicesToRemove array and remove the corresponding element from the inputArray. However, this approach has a time complexity of O(n^2), which can be very inefficient for large input arrays and index arrays.\nA more efficient approach is to create a new empty array to hold the updated elements, and then iterate through the inputArray. For each element in the inputArray, check if its index is in the indicesToRemove array. If it is not, append it to the new array. This approach has a time complexity of O(n), which is much more efficient.\nHere is the Swift code for the function:\nfunc removeElements(_ array: [Int], _ indicesToRemove: [Int]) -> [Int] {\n    var updatedArray = [Int]()\n    for (index, element) in array.enumerated() {\n        if !indicesToRemove.contains(index) {\n            updatedArray.append(element)\n        }\n    }\n    return updatedArray\n}\nYou can call this function using the example input array and indicesToRemove array like this:\nlet updatedArray = removeElements(inputArray, indicesToRemove)\nprint(updatedArray)\nThis will output:\n[1, 3, 6, 7]"

        "content": "To efficiently remove multiple elements from an input array based on an array of indices, we can optimize the algorithm to achieve better performance than O(n^2). Here\u2019s a more detailed explanation of an O(n) approach and corresponding Swift code:\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Use a Set for Indices**:\n   - Convert the `indicesToRemove` array into a `Set`. This allows for O(1) average time complexity when checking if an index needs to be removed. This preprocessing step requires O(m) time, where m is the number of indices to remove.\n\n2. **Iterate Over the Input Array**:\n   - Traverse through the `inputArray` using an enumerated loop to access both elements and their indices.\n   - For each element, check if the current index is in the `indicesToRemove` set.\n   - If the index is not in the set, append the element to a new array.\n\n3. **Time Complexity**:\n   - Converting `indicesToRemove` to a set takes O(m) time.\n   - Iterating through `inputArray` takes O(n) time, where n is the size of the input array.\n   - The overall complexity is O(n + m), which is efficient, especially when `m` is much smaller than `n`.\n\n### Swift Code\n\nHere's the Swift implementation:\n\n```swift\nfunc removeElements(_ array: [Int], _ indicesToRemove: [Int]) -> [Int] {\n    // Convert indicesToRemove to a Set for efficient lookup\n    let indicesSet = Set(indicesToRemove)\n    \n    // Create a new array to store elements that are not removed\n    var updatedArray = [Int]()\n    \n    // Iterate over the input array\n    for (index, element) in array.enumerated() {\n        // Check if the index is in the set of indices to remove\n        if !indicesSet.contains(index) {\n            updatedArray.append(element)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return updatedArray\n}\n\n// Example Usage\nlet inputArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\nlet indicesToRemove = [1, 3, 4]\nlet updatedArray = removeElements(inputArray, indicesToRemove)\nprint(updatedArray) // Output: [1, 3, 6, 7]\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Efficiency**: By using a set for indices, we avoid the O(n) lookup time of using `contains` on an array, reducing it to O(1).\n- **Flexibility**: This approach is suitable for large input arrays and varying sizes of `indicesToRemove`.\n- **Performance**: The overall complexity is O(n + m), making it scalable and efficient."
