My goal is to create a new field that categorizes these ages into bands such as 'under 18', 'under 40', and 'over 40'. I know how to use the lambda function to capture a single if / else statement but I am unsure how to incorporate multiple if statements, for example: `if age < 18 then 'under 18' elif age < 40 then 'under 40' else '>40'`. I don't believe I can achieve this using just lambda and I am not sure how to approach it differently. Here is my current code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as n\n\nd = {'Age' : pd.Series([36., 42., 6., 66., 38.]) }\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(d)\n\ndf['Age_Group'] =  df['Age'].map(lambda x: '<18' if x < 19 else '>18')\n\nprint(df)\n```"

        "content": "To categorize ages into multiple bands like 'under 18', 'under 40', and 'over 40', you can use the `apply` method with a custom function instead of using `map` with a lambda function. The `apply` method allows you to define more complex logic that goes beyond a single if/else statement. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create the DataFrame\nd = {'Age': pd.Series([36., 42., 6., 66., 38.])}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(d)\n\n# Define a function to categorize ages\ndef categorize_age(age):\n    if age < 18:\n        return 'under 18'\n    elif age < 40:\n        return 'under 40'\n    else:\n        return 'over 40'\n\n# Apply the function to the 'Age' column\ndf['Age_Group'] = df['Age'].apply(categorize_age)\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nIn this code, we define a `categorize_age` function that checks the age and returns the appropriate category. The `apply` method is called on the 'Age' column with this function, and a new column 'Age_Group' is created with the results. This approach is flexible and allows you to handle more complex logic than what a lambda function might typically handle."
