    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Models aren't loaded yet,\" typically occurs when you try to access models before Django has fully set up its application registry. This usually happens if you try to access models too early in the setup process or if there's an issue with the order of imports.\n\nHere are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Proper Import Order**:\n   - Avoid importing any models or calling functions that access models before `django.setup()` has been called. In your `manage.py`, ensure that `django.setup()` is called before any other imports that rely on models.\n\n2. **Check for Circular Imports**:\n   - Make sure there are no circular imports in your project that might cause the models to be accessed prematurely.\n\n3. **Upgrade Django**:\n   - Django 1.7 is quite old, and there have been many improvements and bug fixes in newer versions. If possible, consider upgrading to a more recent version of Django. Be aware that this might require some changes to your codebase to accommodate breaking changes in newer Django versions.\n\n4. **Django Apps Configuration**:\n   - Ensure that all your apps are correctly listed in `INSTALLED_APPS` in your Django `settings.py` file.\n\n5. **Check for Custom User Model**:\n   - If you have a custom user model specified in `AUTH_USER_MODEL`, ensure that it is correctly defined and there are no issues with its definition.\n\n6. **Verify the Registration App**:\n   - If you're using a third-party registration app, ensure that it is compatible with the Django version you're using. Some apps might require a specific version of Django.\n\n7. **Debugging**:\n   - Add some print statements or use a debugger to trace the execution order and identify where the premature model access occurs.\n\nHere's an updated version of your `manage.py` that ensures `django.setup()` is called before any model-related imports:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport django\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    os.environ.setdefault(\"DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\", \"steelrumors.settings\")\n    django.setup()  # Ensure this is called before importing models or model-related functions\n\n    from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line\n\n    execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)\n```\n\nIf the problem persists, you might need to look deeper into your application structure and the third-party apps you're using to ensure compatibility and correct configuration."
