        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to distribute 10 apples among 5 friends such that each friend receives a different number of apples. Since the numbers must be distinct and add up to 10, we should look for distinct positive integer solutions to this equation. \n\nLet's denote the number of apples given to each friend as \\(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4,\\) and \\(a_5\\) where \\(a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < a_4 < a_5\\) and \\(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 10\\).\n\nConsidering the smallest set of distinct positive integers: \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\), we can see that:\n\\[1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15\\]\n\nSince this sum is greater than 10, we need to adjust the numbers to sum to 10 while keeping them distinct. \n\nLet's try with lower numbers starting from the smallest possible combination:\n- If \\(a_1 = 0\\), then \\(a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5\\) must be distinct positive integers.\n- The smallest distinct set starting from 0 would be \\(0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\), but that only sums to 10, not less than 10.\n\nSince \\(a_1\\) must be at least 1, let's use the smallest distinct set starting from 1:\n- \\(a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, a_3 = 3, a_4 = 4\\), but that sums to 10 already, so \\(a_5\\) would need to be larger than 4, violating our distinct integer condition.\n\nThus, we need to find a combination that does not exceed 10 and keeps all numbers distinct. \n\nLet's try reducing some values:\n- \\(a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, a_3 = 3, a_4 = 5, a_5 = 6\\)\n- The sum is \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 17\\), which is too high.\n\nLet's try another combination:\n- \\(a_1 = 0, a_2 = 1, a_3 = 2, a_4 = 3, a_5 = 4\\)\n- This sums to \\(0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10\\).\n\nSo the correct set is \\(0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\).\n\nHowever, since a friend cannot receive 0 apples, we realize a mistake in consideration. Re-evaluating, we find that there is a need to adjust our approach.\n\nFurther analysis shows that the solutions should be:\n- \\( (1, 2, 3, 4), (0, 1, 2, 3) \\)\n\nThe correct answer is that there are no valid ways to distribute 10 apples among 5 friends such that each receives a distinct non-zero number. This is a trick question because one of the conditions cannot be met. Thus, the answer is zero, which is not a prime number, indicating possibly an error in the problem setup or a misunderstanding."
