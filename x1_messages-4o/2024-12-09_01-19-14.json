The systemd script and the Python script are provided below. When I attempt to start this service with the command `systemctl start zebra-node.service`, the service never finishes its starting sequence and I have to interrupt it with Ctrl+C. The script is still running, but its status switches from 'activating' to 'deactivating' after some time. I am currently using python-daemon (although I've tried without it and the symptoms were similar). Do I need to add some additional features to my script or is there an error in my systemd file?"

        "content": "To troubleshoot the issue you're facing with your Python daemon and `systemd` service, let's start by examining both your Python script and your `systemd` service file. Here are some common considerations and potential solutions:\n\n### Python Script\n\n1. **Daemonization**: If you're using `python-daemon`, ensure that your script properly handles daemonization by detaching from the terminal and running in the background.\n\n2. **Logging**: Make sure your script is logging output somewhere, as this can be crucial for debugging. You might want to log both standard output and error to files.\n\n3. **Graceful Shutdown**: Implement signal handling for signals like `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` to allow your script to shut down gracefully when the service is stopped.\n\n### Systemd Service File\n\nHere's a basic template for a `systemd` service file that you can compare with your own:\n\n```ini\n[Unit]\nDescription=My Python Daemon\nAfter=network.target\n\n[Service]\nType=simple\nUser=your-username\nWorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/script\nExecStart=/usr/bin/env python3 /path/to/your/script/your_script.py\nRestart=on-failure\nStandardOutput=file:/var/log/your_script.log\nStandardError=file:/var/log/your_script_error.log\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\n### Key Points to Consider\n\n1. **Type**: For simple scripts that don't fork, use `Type=simple`. If your script daemonizes itself (forks), you might need `Type=forking`.\n\n2. **ExecStart**: Ensure that the path to the Python interpreter and your script is correct. Using `/usr/bin/env python3` can help if you're unsure where Python 3 is installed.\n\n3. **User**: Specify the user that should run the script. Ensure this user has the necessary permissions.\n\n4. **WorkingDirectory**: Set this to the directory where your script resides or where it needs to run.\n\n5. **Logging**: Redirect `StandardOutput` and `StandardError` to log files for easier debugging.\n\n### Debugging Steps\n\n1. **Check Logs**: Use `journalctl -xe -u zebra-node.service` to view logs related to your service. It can provide clues about why the service isn't starting properly.\n\n2. **Script Output**: Ensure that your script is logging any errors or important information to a file so you can inspect it after attempting to start the service.\n\n3. **Permissions**: Verify that the user running the service has execute permissions on the script and read/write permissions for any necessary files or directories.\n\n4. **Simplify**: Temporarily simplify your script to the bare minimum to ensure it works with `systemd`. Gradually add back features to identify what might be causing the issue.\n\n5. **Test Manually**: Run the script manually (outside of `systemd`) to ensure it behaves as expected without any daemonization issues.\n\nAdjust your script and service file based on these guidelines, and you should be able to identify what might be causing the problem with your `systemd` service."
