Here's an example of how you might structure your query:\n\n```\n(\"long-term economic advantages\" OR \"economic benefits\" OR \"economic analysis\") AND (\"renewable energy\" OR \"sustainable energy\") AND (\"fossil fuels\" OR \"traditional energy sources\") AND (\"initial investment costs\" OR \"capital costs\") AND (\"maintenance costs\" OR \"operational costs\") AND (\"externalities\" OR \"environmental impact\" OR \"social impact\") AND (\"peer-reviewed\")\n```\n\nYou can input this query into the search bar of a scholarly database like PubMed, JSTOR, Google Scholar, or any other similar platform. Make sure to use the filters provided by these platforms to limit your search to peer-reviewed articles only. Adjust the keywords as needed based on the specific database or additional focus areas you may want to include."
