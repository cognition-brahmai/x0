        "content": "To determine a true statement about the numbers 24 and 36, we can find their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. One true statement is that the GCD of 24 and 36 is 12. Below is the C++ code that demonstrates the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of these two numbers:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\n// Function to calculate GCD using Euclidean algorithm\nint gcd(int a, int b) {\n    while (b != 0) {\n        int remainder = a % b;\n        a = b;\n        b = remainder;\n    }\n    return a;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int num1 = 24;\n    int num2 = 36;\n\n    int result = gcd(num1, num2);\n\n    cout << \"The GCD of \" << num1 << \" and \" << num2 << \" is: \" << result << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initial Values**: Start with `a = 24` and `b = 36`.\n2. **First Iteration**: Calculate `remainder = 24 % 36 = 24`, then set `a = 36` and `b = 24`.\n3. **Second Iteration**: Calculate `remainder = 36 % 24 = 12`, then set `a = 24` and `b = 12`.\n4. **Third Iteration**: Calculate `remainder = 24 % 12 = 0`, then set `a = 12` and `b = 0`.\n\nThe loop ends when `b` becomes 0, and at this point, `a` contains the GCD, which is 12.\n\nThus, a true statement about the numbers 24 and 36 is that their GCD is 12."
