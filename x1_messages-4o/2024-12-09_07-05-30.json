When I try to run my code, Tensorflow is able to detect the GPU's when invoked \"locally\", but fails to detect them when invoked by the \"remote\" worker. What could be causing this issue?\n\nHere is the code I am running:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\nimport ray\n\nray.init()\n\nBATCH_SIZE = 100\nNUM_BATCHES = 1\nNUM_ITERS = 201\n\nclass Network(object):\n    def __init__(self, x, y):\n        # Seed TensorFlow to make the script deterministic.\n        tf.set_random_seed(0)\n        ...\n```\n\nThe `local_network` appears to be responsible for these messages in the logs:\n\n```\n2018-01-26 17:24:33.149634: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:1045] Creating TensorFlow device (/gpu:0) -> (device: 0, name: Quadro M5000, pci bus id: 0000:03:00.0)\n2018-01-26 17:24:33.149642: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:1045] Creating TensorFlow device (/gpu:1) -> (device: 1, name: Quadro M5000, pci bus id: 0000:04:00.0)\n```\n\nWhile the `remote_network` seems to be responsible for this message:\n\n```\n2018-01-26 17:24:34.309270: E tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_driver.cc:406] failed call to cuInit: CUDA_ERROR_NO_DEVICE\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to how Ray manages remote workers and their environment, particularly in relation to GPU visibility and CUDA initialization. Here are some potential causes and solutions to consider:\n\n1. **CUDA and GPU Visibility**: When running remotely with Ray, the CUDA environment may not be properly set up for the worker processes. Ray might not be able to see the GPUs because the environment variables that specify GPU visibility aren't correctly passed to the remote processes. Ensure that the following environment variables are set:\n   - `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`: This should be set to the indices of the available GPUs. For example, `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1` if you have 2 GPUs.\n\n2. **Ray Configuration**: Make sure that Ray is configured to utilize GPUs. You can specify resources when initializing Ray actors. For example:\n   ```python\n   @ray.remote(num_gpus=1)\n   class RemoteNetwork:\n       def __init__(self):\n           # Your network initialization code\n           ...\n   ```\n   This informs Ray to allocate a GPU for each remote actor.\n\n3. **TensorFlow Version**: Ensure your TensorFlow version is compatible with your CUDA and cuDNN versions. TensorFlow's GPU support is dependent on specific versions of CUDA and cuDNN, and mismatches can lead to issues with GPU detection.\n\n4. **Check Ray Worker Logs**: Look into the logs for the Ray workers to identify any additional error messages or warnings that might provide more context on why the GPUs aren't being detected.\n\n5. **GPU Driver**: Ensure your NVIDIA drivers are up to date and compatible with the version of CUDA you are using. An outdated driver can sometimes cause issues with GPU detection.\n\n6. **Environment Isolation**: If using virtual environments or Anaconda environments, make sure that all necessary environment variables and paths are correctly set up in the environment where Ray workers are running. You may need to manually set them in your script or use a startup script.\n\n7. **Local Session Initialization**: Ensure that all TensorFlow sessions or contexts are initialized within the Ray remote function or class, rather than outside it. This ensures that the CUDA context is correctly tied to the worker's environment.\n\nBy checking and adjusting these configurations, you should be able to resolve the issue of TensorFlow not detecting GPUs in Ray's remote workers."
