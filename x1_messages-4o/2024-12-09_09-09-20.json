        "content": "You can achieve this by using the `filter` method in JavaScript, which creates a new array with all the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can filter out numbers that are divisible by 10:\n\n```javascript\n// Sample array of numbers\nconst numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50];\n\n// Use the filter method to get numbers divisible by 10\nconst divisibleByTen = numbers.filter(number => number % 10 === 0);\n\nconsole.log(divisibleByTen); // Output: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n```\n\nIn this example, the `filter` method is applied to the `numbers` array. The callback function `number => number % 10 === 0` checks whether each number in the array is divisible by 10 (i.e., whether the remainder of the division by 10 is zero). The resulting array, `divisibleByTen`, will contain only the numbers that meet this condition."
