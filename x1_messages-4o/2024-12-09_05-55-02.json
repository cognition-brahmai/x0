        "content": "If you're trying to clear the screen in the shell (such as IDLE or another Python interactive shell), the `os.system('cls')` command won't work as expected because it is intended for use in a command-line interface like the Windows Command Prompt, not within a Python shell or IDE environment.\n\nHowever, you can create a function that tries to clear the shell screen by using a workaround with some additional checks. Here's a more versatile solution that works on different platforms:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\n\ndef clear_screen():\n    if os.name == 'nt':\n        # For Windows\n        os.system('cls')\n    else:\n        # For macOS and Linux\n        os.system('clear')\n\n# Call the function to clear the screen\nclear_screen()\n```\n\nIf you're working within an IDE or an interactive environment like IDLE or Jupyter Notebook, you might need to manually clear the screen output, as these environments may not support the direct clearing of their console via the `os.system` command.\n\nFor Jupyter Notebook, you can use the following magic command:\n\n```python\nfrom IPython.display import clear_output\n\nclear_output(wait=True)\n```\n\nThis will clear the output in a Jupyter Notebook cell. Unfortunately, for IDLE, there isn't a straightforward method to clear the screen, as it is not designed to support such operations directly. You might need to restart the shell or manually delete the output."
