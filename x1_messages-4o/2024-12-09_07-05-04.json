For instance, I have created a named tuple like this:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nspam = namedtuple('eggs', 'x, y, z')\nham = spam(1,2,3)\n```\n\nI can easily access elements of `ham` using `ham.x` or `ham.z`, and when I call `ham` in the interpreter, it gives me `eggs(x=1, y=2, z=3)`. However, what I want is to get just the name 'eggs'. I have tried using `ham.__repr__.split('(')[0]` and it gives me 'eggs', but it feels a bit messy. Is there a cleaner way to do this? Also, if it's not easy to access the 'eggs' aspect of named tuples, why is it included?"

        "content": "In Python, when you create a named tuple using `namedtuple`, it generates a new class with the provided name. To access the name of the named tuple type, you can use the `__name__` attribute of the named tuple class itself, not the instance. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import namedtuple\n\n# Define the named tuple\nspam = namedtuple('eggs', 'x, y, z')\n\n# Create an instance\nham = spam(1, 2, 3)\n\n# Access the name of the named tuple\ntuple_name = spam.__name__\nprint(tuple_name)  # Output: 'eggs'\n```\n\nIn this example, `spam.__name__` gives you the name of the named tuple type, which is 'eggs'. This method is cleaner and more reliable than parsing the string representation of the instance.\n\nAs for why the name is included in named tuples, it's primarily for readability and debugging purposes. When you print an instance of a named tuple, the name is displayed to help you understand what type of data structure you're dealing with, which can be especially useful when dealing with multiple named tuples in a larger codebase."
