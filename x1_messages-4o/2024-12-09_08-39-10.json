However, I'm encountering a `NameError` message stating that the name 'display' is undefined. My code is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\ndata = pd.DataFrame(data=[tweet.text for tweet in tweets], columns=['Tweets'])\ndisplay(data.head(10))\n```\nCan anyone suggest a solution to this problem?"

        "content": "The `NameError` you are encountering is because the `display()` function is not defined in your code as it is not a built-in Python function. The `display()` function is part of the IPython.display module, which is commonly used in Jupyter Notebooks to render rich output. To resolve this error, you need to import the `display` function from the appropriate module.\n\nHere's how you can fix your code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom IPython.display import display\n\n# Assuming 'tweets' is a list of tweet objects with a 'text' attribute\ndata = pd.DataFrame(data=[tweet.text for tweet in tweets], columns=['Tweets'])\n\n# Use the display function to show the dataframe\ndisplay(data.head(10))\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you are not in an environment like Jupyter Notebook that supports the `display()` function, you can use the built-in `print()` function to show the DataFrame:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming 'tweets' is a list of tweet objects with a 'text' attribute\ndata = pd.DataFrame(data=[tweet.text for tweet in tweets], columns=['Tweets'])\n\n# Use the print function to show the dataframe\nprint(data.head(10))\n```\n\nThis will work in any standard Python environment, including scripts and terminal sessions."
