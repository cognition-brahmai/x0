The JSON data is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"status\": {\n        \"statuscode\": 200,\n        \"statusmessage\": \"Everything OK\"\n    },\n\n    \"result\": [{\n        \"id\": 22,\n        \"club_id\": 16182\n    }, {\n        \"id\": 23,\n        \"club_id\": 16182\n    }, {\n        \"id\": 24,\n        \"club_id\": 16182\n    }, {\n        \"id\": 25,\n        \"club_id\": 16182\n    }, {\n        \"id\": 26,\n        \"club_id\": 16182\n    }, {\n        \"id\": 27,\n        \"club_id\": 16182\n    }]\n}\n```\n\nI've attempted to read the JSON file and convert it to a dataframe using the following code:\n\n```python\nj_df = pd.read_json('json_file.json')\nj_df\n\nwith open(j_file) as jsonfile:\n    data = json.load(jsonfile)\n```\n\nHowever, I am encountering a ValueError stating \"Mixing dicts with non-Series may lead to ambiguous ordering.\" How can I correctly convert this JSON structure into a pandas dataframe?"

        "content": "To convert your JSON structure into a pandas DataFrame, you need to access the specific part of the JSON data that you want to convert. In your case, you should convert the \"result\" part of the JSON, which is a list of dictionaries, into a DataFrame.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load JSON data from the file\nwith open('json_file.json') as jsonfile:\n    data = json.load(jsonfile)\n\n# Convert the 'result' part of the JSON into a DataFrame\nresult_df = pd.DataFrame(data['result'])\n\nprint(result_df)\n```\n\nThis code snippet reads the JSON data from the file, extracts the list of dictionaries under the \"result\" key, and then converts that list into a pandas DataFrame. This should resolve the ValueError you're encountering and give you a DataFrame with \"id\" and \"club_id\" as columns."
