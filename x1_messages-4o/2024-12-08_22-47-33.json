        "content": "To compute the exact quotient and remainder when 9 is divided by 20 using long division, and then express the quotient as a mixed number in lowest terms, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Long Division of 9 by 20:\n\n1. **Divide**: Determine how many times 20 goes into 9. Since 20 is larger than 9, it goes 0 times.\n2. **Multiply**: 0 times 20 equals 0.\n3. **Subtract**: 9 minus 0 equals 9.\n4. **Bring Down**: There are no more digits to bring down, so we consider the remainder as 9.\n\n### Summary of Long Division:\n\n| Dividend | Divisor | Quotient | Remainder |\n|----------|---------|----------|-----------|\n|    9     |   20    |    0     |     9     |\n\n### Expressing the Result as a Mixed Number:\n\nThe quotient is 0 and the remainder is 9. This can be expressed as a mixed number:\n\n\\[ 0 \\frac{9}{20} \\]\n\n### Simplifying to Lowest Terms:\n\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{9}{20}\\) is already in its lowest terms because 9 and 20 have no common factors other than 1.\n\n### Converting to Decimal:\n\nTo express the mixed number as a decimal, we convert \\(\\frac{9}{20}\\) to a decimal:\n\n\\[ \\frac{9}{20} = 0.45 \\]\n\n### Mixed Number in Decimal Form:\n\nThe mixed number is expressed as:\n\n\\[ 0.45 \\]\n\n### Rounding to the Nearest Hundredth:\n\nThe decimal 0.45 is already rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\n### Final Table Summary:\n\n| Step         | Calculation          | Result |\n|--------------|----------------------|--------|\n| Division     | 9 \u00f7 20               | 0      |\n| Remainder    | 9                    |        |\n| Fraction     | \\(\\frac{9}{20}\\)     |        |\n| Decimal      | 0.45                 |        |\n| Rounded      | 0.45                 |        |\n\nTherefore, the quotient is \\(0\\frac{9}{20}\\) or 0.45 when rounded to the nearest hundredth."
