I've tried using the rename function as shown below, but it doesn't seem to work as there's no '1' entry in the DataFrame.columns dictionary. Here's what I've tried:\n\n```python\ndrugInfo.rename(columns = {'col_1': 'col_1_new_name'}, inplace = True)\n```\n\nI would like to rename the first column like this:\n\n```python\ndrugInfo.rename(columns = {1: 'col_1_new_name'}, inplace = True)\n```\n\nBut it's not renaming the column as expected. Can someone provide a solution?"

        "content": "To rename a column in a pandas DataFrame based on its index position rather than its name, you can first retrieve the column name using its index, and then use the `rename` method. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Assuming 'drugInfo' is your DataFrame and you want to rename the first column\n# Get the column name using the index\nfirst_column_name = drugInfo.columns[0]\n\n# Rename the column using the retrieved column name\ndrugInfo.rename(columns={first_column_name: 'col_1_new_name'}, inplace=True)\n```\n\nThis way, you are dynamically determining the column name based on its index position and renaming it accordingly. Make sure to replace `0` with the appropriate index if you wish to rename a different column."
