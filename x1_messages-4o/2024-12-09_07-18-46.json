        "content": "To create an object of a class defined in a different file within the same package in Python, you need to properly import the class from the file where it is defined. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Ensure your directory structure is correct:**\n   Make sure both `car.py` and `Mercedes.py` are in the same directory and this directory is recognized as a package (often indicated by the presence of an `__init__.py` file, though this is not strictly necessary in Python 3.3+).\n\n2. **Import the class in `Mercedes.py`:**\n   You need to import the `Car` class from the `car` module in `Mercedes.py`. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n   Assuming your directory structure is like this:\n\n   ```\n   my_package/\n       car.py\n       Mercedes.py\n   ```\n\n   Your `car.py` might look like this:\n\n   ```python\n   # car.py\n   class Car:\n       def __init__(self, model, year):\n           self.model = model\n           self.year = year\n\n       def display(self):\n           print(f\"Car Model: {self.model}, Year: {self.year}\")\n   ```\n\n   And your `Mercedes.py` should import the `Car` class like this:\n\n   ```python\n   # Mercedes.py\n   from car import Car\n\n   # Now you can create an object of Car\n   my_car = Car(\"Mercedes-Benz\", 2023)\n   my_car.display()\n   ```\n\n3. **Run the `Mercedes.py` file:**\n   When you run `Mercedes.py`, it should correctly create an instance of the `Car` class and execute without any errors.\n\nThis approach ensures that the `Car` class is available in `Mercedes.py` and you can create objects of it as needed. If the files are part of a larger project or package, ensure that the package is in your Python path, or use relative imports if appropriate."
