Here is the code I'm working with:\n\n```python\nset1 = {1, 2, 3}\nset2 = {True, False}\n\nprint(set1 | set2)\n# {False, 1, 2, 3}\n\nprint(set2 | set1)\n#{False, True, 2, 3}\n```"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is due to how Python handles boolean values in sets. In Python, `True` is equivalent to `1`, and `False` is equivalent to `0`. When you perform a union operation on sets that include boolean values and integers, the boolean values can be interpreted as their integer equivalents, which may affect the order of elements in the resulting set.\n\nHere's why you're seeing the difference:\n\n- In `set1 | set2`, `{1, 2, 3} | {True, False}` results in `{False, 1, 2, 3}`. This is because `True` is considered equal to `1`, so when `1` is already present in the set, `True` does not appear separately.\n  \n- In `set2 | set1`, `{True, False} | {1, 2, 3}` results in `{False, True, 2, 3}`. Here, `True` appears as it comes from the first set, and `1` is not separately added from the second set since `True` is already present.\n\nThe order of elements in a set is determined by the hash values of the elements and the internal implementation of the set, which can vary. Sets in Python are unordered collections, so you might see different orders when printing them, especially when dealing with elements that have equal values or hash collisions.\n\nIf you want to ensure a specific order when displaying the results, you might consider converting the set to a list and sorting it before printing:\n\n```python\nprint(sorted(set1 | set2))\nprint(sorted(set2 | set1))\n```\n\nThis will give you a consistent order in the output, regardless of the initial order of the sets."
