        "content": "To extract links from HTML code using regular expressions in Python, you can use the `re` module. However, it's important to note that using regular expressions to parse HTML is not always the most reliable method due to the complexity and variability of HTML. Libraries like BeautifulSoup or lxml are typically recommended for parsing HTML. Nonetheless, if you still want to use regular expressions, here's a basic example:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Sample HTML content\nhtml_content = '''\n<a href=\"https://example.com\">Example</a>\n<a href='http://example.org'>Another Example</a>\n<a href=https://example.net>Third Example</a>\n'''\n\n# Regular expression pattern to match href links\npattern = r'href=[\"\\']?(https?://[^\"\\'>]+)'\n\n# Find all matches in the HTML content\nlinks = re.findall(pattern, html_content)\n\n# Print the extracted links\nfor link in links:\n    print(link)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `href=[\"\\']?`: Matches the `href` attribute, which may be followed by either a double quote `\"` or single quote `'` or no quote at all.\n- `(https?://[^\"\\'>]+)`: Captures the URL. It starts with `http` or `https`, followed by `://`, and continues to match any character except double quotes `\"`, single quotes `'`, or the greater-than symbol `>` to ensure it captures the entire URL up to the point where it's closed or another attribute begins.\n\n### Note:\nWhile this regex pattern can work for simple cases, it might not handle more complex HTML structures or malformed tags. For a more robust solution, consider using BeautifulSoup:\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n# Parse the HTML content\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')\n\n# Extract all links\nlinks = [a['href'] for a in soup.find_all('a', href=True)]\n\n# Print the extracted links\nfor link in links:\n    print(link)\n```\n\nUsing BeautifulSoup is generally more effective and safer for HTML parsing tasks."
