I have two models in my project that use a timestamp field, which is by default set to `timezone.now()`. However, I've noticed a peculiar error. When Model one is created at time 7:30 PM and Model two is created at time 10:00 PM, the time for Model two in the MySQL database is stored as 7:30 PM instead of the actual time of creation. This pattern continues for every model that is created thereafter, where it's timestamp is saved as 7:30 PM, not the actual time, until a certain duration passes. Then a new time is set and all the following models have that new time. I have some methods in place to strip my timezones of their `tzinfo`'s and replace them with UTC because I'm doing a `timezone.now() - creationTime` calculation to create a \"model was posted this long ago\" feature in the project. However, I don't believe this should be causing the problem. I also don't think using `datetime.datetime.now()` will make any difference. Can anyone help me understand why this is happening?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with Django's `default=timezone.now()` functionality could be related to several factors. Here are a few things you might want to check to diagnose and resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Model Definition and Default Value**:\n   - Ensure that you're using `django.utils.timezone.now` correctly in your model field definition:\n     ```python\n     from django.db import models\n     from django.utils import timezone\n\n     class MyModel(models.Model):\n         timestamp = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now)\n     ```\n   - `timezone.now` should be passed without parentheses because you want to pass the function itself, not its current value.\n\n2. **Database Configuration**:\n   - Check your MySQL database settings, particularly the `time_zone` setting. Ensure that it's set to the appropriate time zone or UTC. You can check this by executing:\n     ```sql\n     SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'time_zone';\n     ```\n   - If it's not set to UTC, you can update it using:\n     ```sql\n     SET GLOBAL time_zone = '+00:00';\n     ```\n\n3. **Server Timezone**:\n   - Verify the server's timezone settings where your Django application is hosted. If it's different from UTC, it might affect how timestamps are stored or retrieved.\n\n4. **Django Settings**:\n   - Make sure that your Django settings are configured to use the timezone correctly. In your `settings.py`, you should have:\n     ```python\n     USE_TZ = True\n     TIME_ZONE = 'UTC'\n     ```\n\n5. **Storing Timezone Information**:\n   - If you're stripping `tzinfo` and replacing it with UTC, ensure that this process is done correctly and only where necessary. Stripping `tzinfo` may lead to incorrect time calculations if not handled properly.\n\n6. **Caching or Code Logic**:\n   - Review if there is any caching mechanism or logic in your code that might be causing the same timestamp to be reused.\n   - Check if there's any part of your code that's inadvertently setting the timestamp to a specific time instead of using `timezone.now`.\n\n7. **Database Connection Pooling**:\n   - If you're using a connection pool, ensure that the connections are not holding onto outdated timezone settings. Refresh the connections if necessary.\n\n8. **Django Signals**:\n   - If you're using Django signals such as `pre_save` or `post_save`, check whether any of these might be altering the timestamp.\n\nBy going through these steps, you should be able to identify the root cause of the problem and ensure that timestamps are stored correctly in your database. If the issue persists, consider isolating the problem by testing with a minimal setup or reviewing recent changes in your codebase that might have affected this behavior."
