In MATLAB, you can use the built-in `gcd` function to do this. Here is the code you can use:\n\n```matlab\na = 36;\nb = 48;\ngcd_value = gcd(a, b);\ndisp(gcd_value);\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will display the GCD of 36 and 48, which is the largest positive integer that evenly divides both numbers. The output will be `12`."
