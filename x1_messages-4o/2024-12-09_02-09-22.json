        "content": "Yes, you can retrieve results as dictionaries using the PyMySQL library by modifying the cursor to use a dictionary cursor. This allows you to access the query results with column names as keys, rather than using indices. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Import the necessary modules and establish a connection to your database.\n2. Use `pymysql.cursors.DictCursor` when creating the cursor.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\nimport pymysql\n\n# Establish connection\nconnection = pymysql.connect(\n    host='your_host',\n    user='your_username',\n    password='your_password',\n    database='your_database',\n    cursorclass=pymysql.cursors.DictCursor  # Use DictCursor here\n)\n\ntry:\n    with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n        # Execute a query\n        sql = \"SELECT * FROM your_table\"\n        cursor.execute(sql)\n        \n        # Fetch all results\n        results = cursor.fetchall()\n        \n        # Results will be a list of dictionaries\n        for row in results:\n            print(row)  # Each row is a dictionary\nfinally:\n    connection.close()\n```\n\nIn this example, `pymysql.cursors.DictCursor` is used to ensure that the results are returned as dictionaries. Each row in the results will be a dictionary with column names as keys."
