However, I'm having issues understanding the behavior of the pandas `concat` function with respect to my timestamps. Specifically, the index changes when I use `concat`. How can I use `concat` to reproduce the results I obtain using `append`, given that `concat` is much faster (24.6 ms per loop vs 3.02 s per loop)?"

        "content": "When you're working with multiple pandas DataFrames and aim to combine them efficiently while preserving the index, using `pandas.concat()` is indeed a faster option compared to `DataFrame.append()`. If you're experiencing issues with the index changing, it's likely because of how `concat` handles the index by default. Here's how you can use `concat` to achieve the same results as `append`, while preserving the index:\n\n1. **Reset the Index Before Concatenation**: If your DataFrames have different indices that you want to preserve in the final DataFrame, you can reset the index before concatenation and then set it back afterward.\n\n2. **Use `ignore_index` Parameter**: If you do not need to keep the original index and just want a new continuous index, you can use the `ignore_index=True` parameter in `concat`.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assume df_list is your list of DataFrames\ndf_list = [df1, df2, df3, df4]\n\n# Option 1: Preserve original indices\nresult = pd.concat(df_list, axis=0)\n\n# Option 2: Ignore original indices and create a new continuous index\nresult = pd.concat(df_list, axis=0, ignore_index=True)\n\n# Option 3: If you want to preserve indices but reset them afterward\nresult = pd.concat(df_list, axis=0).reset_index(drop=True)\n\n# Now 'result' is your combined DataFrame\n```\n\n- **Option 1** will maintain the original indices of the individual DataFrames in the concatenated result. If the indices are overlapping, you'll have duplicate indices in the result.\n  \n- **Option 2** will create a new, continuous index, which is often desired if the original indices are not important.\n  \n- **Option 3** allows you to initially preserve the indices, but then resets them to a continuous range if that's what you need for further processing.\n\nChoose the option that best fits your requirements based on whether or not you need to maintain the original indices."
