The value could either be 1 or 0, but my concern is whether they are all the same. I am currently using the following code:\n```python\nif 1 == x and  1 == y and 1 == z: \n    sameness = True\n```\nAnd I have also found this other method:\n```python\nif 1 in {x, y, z}:\n```\nBut this seems to work as:\n```python\nif 1 == x or  1 == y or 1 == z: \n    atleastOneMatch = True\n```\nIs there a way to check if 1 is in each of the variables: x, y, and z? Or, is there a more concise method of checking if x, y, and z are the same value?"

        "content": "To check if all three variables, `x`, `y`, and `z`, have the same value (either 0 or 1), you can use a simple comparison. A concise way to achieve this is by using Python's set data structure, which can help determine if all values are the same by checking the length of the set:\n\n```python\nif len({x, y, z}) == 1:\n    sameness = True\nelse:\n    sameness = False\n```\n\nThis method works because a set only contains unique elements. So, if `x`, `y`, and `z` are all the same, the set `{x, y, z}` will contain only one unique element, resulting in a length of 1.\n\nAlternatively, if you specifically want to check if all variables are 1, you can do:\n\n```python\nif x == y == z == 1:\n    sameness = True\nelse:\n    sameness = False\n```\n\nThis directly checks if all three variables are equal to 1. If you want to check if all are 0, you can use `x == y == z == 0`."
