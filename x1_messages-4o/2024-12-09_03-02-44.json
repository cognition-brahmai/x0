However, I am unsure about the purpose of the '=' character at the end of the expression within these brackets. For instance, in the following code snippet, what function does the '=' in 'console_error=' perform?\n\n```python\nlog_file = open(\"log_aug_19.txt\", \"w\")\nconsole_error = '...stuff...'           # the real code generates it with regex\nlog_file.write(f'{console_error=}')\n```"

        "content": "In Python, the `=` character inside curly braces `{}` in an f-string is used to provide a more informative output by including both the expression and its result in the formatted string. This feature was introduced in Python 3.8 and is especially useful for debugging purposes.\n\nWhen you use `f'{console_error=}'`, it will output both the variable name and its value. So, if `console_error` contains the string `'...stuff...'`, the f-string will produce the output:\n\n```\nconsole_error='...stuff...'\n```\n\nThis makes it easier to understand what value is associated with which variable when you are logging or printing multiple values. It's a convenient way to see both the name of the variable and its current value in a single output."
