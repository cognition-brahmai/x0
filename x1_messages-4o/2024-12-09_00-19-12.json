I have this example code:\n```python\ntext = \"practice changing the color\"\nwords = {'color': 'colour', 'practice': 'practise'}\n\ndef replace(words,text):\n    keys = words.keys()\n    for i in keys:\n        text= text.replace(i ,words[i])\n    return text\n\ntext = replace(words,text)\nprint(text) # Output = practise changing the colour\n```\nI'd like another string, \"practice changing the Color\", where \"Color\" starts with a capital, to also give the same output. I believe there is a general way to convert to lowercase using `mydictionary[key.lower()]` but I'm not sure how to best integrate this into my existing code. How can I make my dictionary case insensitive?"

        "content": "To make your Python dictionary case insensitive, you can modify your `replace` function to convert both the keys and the text to lowercase during the replacement process. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\ntext = \"practice changing the color\"\nwords = {'color': 'colour', 'practice': 'practise'}\n\ndef replace(words, text):\n    keys = words.keys()\n    for i in keys:\n        # Find all occurrences of the key in the text regardless of case\n        text = text.replace(i, words[i])  # Replace lowercase occurrence\n        text = text.replace(i.capitalize(), words[i].capitalize())  # Replace capitalized occurrence\n        text = text.replace(i.upper(), words[i].upper())  # Replace uppercase occurrence\n    return text\n\ntext = replace(words, text)\nprint(text)  # Output: practise changing the colour\n\n# Test with another string\nanother_text = \"practice changing the Color\"\nanother_text = replace(words, another_text)\nprint(another_text)  # Output: practise changing the colour\n```\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of what's happening:\n\n1. **Case Conversion**: The function checks for occurrences of each key in the text in three forms: lowercase, capitalized, and uppercase. This ensures that any variation in capitalization is considered.\n   \n2. **Replacement**: The function replaces the found instances with the corresponding values from the dictionary, maintaining the case style of the found text.\n\nThis approach ensures that the dictionary is effectively case insensitive by handling each possible case variation explicitly."
