        "content": "To include a SASS compiler in your Flask application that uses Jinja2, you can use the `Flask-Assets` extension along with `libsass`. This setup allows you to compile SASS files into CSS and serve them in your Flask app. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n1. **Install Required Packages:**\n\n   First, you'll need to install the necessary packages. You can do this using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install Flask-Assets libsass\n   ```\n\n2. **Set Up Your Flask Application:**\n\n   Create a basic Flask application, if you haven't already:\n\n   ```python\n   from flask import Flask, render_template\n   from flask_assets import Environment, Bundle\n\n   app = Flask(__name__)\n\n   # Set up Flask-Assets\n   assets = Environment(app)\n\n   # Define a SASS bundle\n   sass = Bundle('src/main.scss', filters='libsass', output='dist/main.css')\n\n   # Register the bundle\n   assets.register('main_sass', sass)\n\n   @app.route('/')\n   def index():\n       return render_template('index.html')\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       app.run(debug=True)\n   ```\n\n3. **Organize Your Project Structure:**\n\n   Structure your project to separate your SASS and CSS files. A typical structure might look like this:\n\n   ```\n   /your_flask_app\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 app.py\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 templates\n   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 index.html\n   \u2514\u2500\u2500 static\n       \u251c\u2500\u2500 src\n       \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.scss\n       \u2514\u2500\u2500 dist\n           \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.css\n   ```\n\n   - `src/main.scss` is where you write your SASS code.\n   - `dist/main.css` is where the compiled CSS will be saved.\n\n4. **Write Your SASS Code:**\n\n   In `static/src/main.scss`, write your SASS code. For example:\n\n   ```scss\n   $primary-color: #3498db;\n\n   body {\n     font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n     background-color: $primary-color;\n     color: white;\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. **Include the Compiled CSS in Your Template:**\n\n   In your `index.html` file, include the compiled CSS file:\n\n   ```html\n   <!DOCTYPE html>\n   <html lang=\"en\">\n   <head>\n       <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n       <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n       <title>Flask with SASS</title>\n       <!-- Link to the compiled CSS -->\n       <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='dist/main.css') }}\">\n   </head>\n   <body>\n       <h1>Hello, Flask with SASS!</h1>\n   </body>\n   </html>\n   ```\n\n6. **Run Your Flask Application:**\n\n   Start your Flask application by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   python app.py\n   ```\n\n   Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser to see your application with the styles applied.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll have a Flask application that uses Flask-Assets to compile SASS into CSS, which can be easily integrated with Jinja2 templates. This method is quite standard and commonly used for such setups."
