I installed Bazel via their shell script (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/download/0.21.0/bazel-0.21.0-installer-linux-x86_64.sh). After executing './configure' in the TensorFlow code and providing default settings (with the exception of adding my machine-specific -m options (-mavx2 -mfma) and pointing Python to the correct Python3 location (/usr/bin/py3)), I ran the command 'bazel build --config=opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package //tensorflow:libtensorflow_framework.so //tensorflow:libtensorflow.so'. However, this process continues to run for a prolonged period and produces numerous INFO warnings regarding signed and unsigned integers and control reaching the end of non-void functions. The compilation continues to progress with two numbers 'N,NNN / X,XXX' constantly growing. I'm running this on an EC2 instance with approximately 16GiB of RAM and 'Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2686 v4 @ 2.30GHz' with 4 cores. What could be causing this issue?"

        "content": "Compiling TensorFlow from source can be a resource-intensive and time-consuming task, especially on a machine with limited resources. Here are some potential reasons and solutions for the prolonged compilation time and warnings you're experiencing:\n\n1. **Resource Limitations**: \n   - Your EC2 instance might not have enough resources (CPU, RAM) to handle the compilation efficiently. TensorFlow is a large codebase and requires significant computational resources.\n   - Consider upgrading to an instance with more CPU cores and RAM to speed up the compilation process.\n\n2. **Compilation Warnings**:\n   - The warnings related to signed and unsigned integers, as well as control reaching the end of non-void functions, are common during compilation and often do not prevent the build from succeeding. However, they may slow down the process if there are a large number of them.\n   - You can try suppressing the warnings by adding appropriate flags in the configuration, but ensure that this doesn't mask any critical issues.\n\n3. **Bazel Configuration**:\n   - Make sure you have configured Bazel optimally. You can try setting a limit on the number of concurrent jobs Bazel runs using the `--jobs` flag. For example, `--jobs=4` to match your number of cores.\n   - Consider using the `--local_ram_resources` flag to specify the amount of RAM Bazel can use, e.g., `--local_ram_resources=15360` for 15GiB.\n\n4. **Dependencies**:\n   - Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and compatible with the TensorFlow version you are trying to compile. Sometimes, mismatched dependencies can lead to prolonged compilation times or failures.\n   - Check for any specific dependencies required for the 2019 version of TensorFlow you're trying to compile.\n\n5. **Bazel Version**:\n   - The Bazel version you are using (0.21.0) is quite old. Consider checking if there are any specific version requirements for the TensorFlow commit you are trying to compile, and if possible, use a more recent version of Bazel that might have performance improvements.\n\n6. **Disk IO**:\n   - Ensure that your disk performance is not a bottleneck. Compilation involves a lot of read/write operations, and a slow disk can hamper the process. Using SSD storage can help improve performance.\n\n7. **Network Latency**:\n   - If your build requires downloading additional dependencies, ensure your network connection is stable and fast enough to handle these downloads efficiently.\n\nIf you've considered these factors and are still facing prolonged compilation times, you might want to look into distributed compilation solutions or pre-built binaries for TensorFlow that can save you the hassle of compiling from source."
