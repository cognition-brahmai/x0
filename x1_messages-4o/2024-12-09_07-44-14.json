I've noticed that both class definitions with and without extending object seem to work fine as shown in the following code:\n\n```python\nclass Foo():\n    def a(self):\n        print \"hello\"\n\nclass Foo(object):\n    def a(self):\n        print \"hello\"\n```\n\nAre there any potential issues or drawbacks if a class is not extended from object?"

        "content": "In Python, especially in versions 2.x, there is a distinction between \"old-style\" and \"new-style\" classes. This distinction is based on whether a class explicitly inherits from `object`.\n\n1. **Old-style classes**: In Python 2, if a class does not explicitly inherit from `object`, it is considered an old-style class. These classes can have some limitations and inconsistencies, especially in terms of method resolution order (MRO), attribute lookup, and some built-in functions or operations.\n\n2. **New-style classes**: By inheriting from `object`, a class becomes a new-style class. This is the recommended approach because it provides a consistent model of class and type, unifies types and classes, and offers better support for advanced features like descriptors, properties, and multiple inheritance with a consistent method resolution order (C3 linearization).\n\nIn Python 3, all classes are new-style classes by default. This means that even if you don't explicitly inherit from `object`, the class will automatically be a new-style class. Therefore, in Python 3, the distinction is no longer necessary, and both class definitions, with or without `object`, will work equivalently.\n\n**Potential issues or drawbacks in Python 2**:\n- **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**: Old-style classes don't use the C3 linearization algorithm for method resolution, which can lead to different and sometimes unexpected method resolution behavior in complex inheritance hierarchies.\n- **Descriptor Protocol**: The descriptor protocol works differently in old-style classes.\n- **Built-in Functions**: Some built-in functions and operations may behave inconsistently or not work as expected with old-style classes.\n\nIn summary, if you're working with Python 2, it is generally advisable to inherit from `object` to ensure new-style class behavior. In Python 3, all classes are inherently new-style classes, so the explicit inheritance from `object` is not necessary but is often still used for clarity and consistency."
