        "content": "The given sequence is a list of square numbers: 0 (0^2), 1 (1^2), 4 (2^2), 9 (3^2), 16 (4^2). The missing number is the next square in the sequence, which is 5^2 = 25.\n\nThe provided C# code calculates the missing number using the formula for the next square number based on the previous number in the sequence. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:\n\n1. The sequence is initialized with `int[] sequence = new int[] { 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, -1 };`.\n2. The code iterates through the sequence with a for loop.\n3. When it finds the placeholder `-1`, it calculates the next square number using the formula `sequence[i] = sequence[i - 1] + 2 * i + 1;`.\n\nFor `i = 5`, the calculation is as follows:\n- `sequence[i - 1]` is 16 (from index 4).\n- `2 * i` is `2 * 5 = 10`.\n- Adding 1 gives `10 + 1 = 11`.\n- So, `sequence[i] = 16 + 11 = 27`.\n\nHowever, this calculation does not seem to follow the logical pattern of squares. The correct approach for square numbers is simply finding the square of the next integer, which correctly gives 25 for 5^2. Let's correct the formula:\n\nReplace `sequence[i] = sequence[i - 1] + 2 * i + 1;` with finding the square of (i-1) since i is the index of the missing number, which is 5^2.\n\nTherefore, the correct value of `sequence[5]` is 25."
