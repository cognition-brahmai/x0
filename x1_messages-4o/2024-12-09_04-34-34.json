However, when I am satisfied with the results and want to transfer them to a file, I encounter a problem. The autoindent in IPython notebook is set to 4 spaces by default but my company's coding style requires an indentation of 2 spaces. How can I alter the autoindent in IPython notebook to have 2 spaces?"

        "content": "To change the default autoindentation from 4 spaces to 2 spaces in an IPython notebook (Jupyter Notebook), you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Custom JavaScript Configuration**:\n   - You can customize the Jupyter Notebook editor by injecting custom JavaScript. This requires creating or modifying the `custom.js` file. Here's how you can do it:\n   \n   - First, locate the Jupyter configuration directory. This is typically found at `~/.jupyter/` on Unix-like systems or `C:\\Users\\<YourUsername>\\.jupyter\\` on Windows.\n\n   - Inside this directory, navigate to the `custom` folder. If it doesn't exist, create it.\n\n   - Inside the `custom` folder, create or open the `custom.js` file.\n\n   - Add the following JavaScript code to the `custom.js` file:\n\n     ```javascript\n     require(['notebook/js/codecell'], function(codecell) {\n         codecell.CodeCell.options_default.cm_config.indentUnit = 2;\n         codecell.CodeCell.options_default.cm_config.tabSize = 2;\n     });\n     ```\n\n2. **Restart Jupyter Notebook**:\n   - After making changes to the `custom.js` file, you will need to restart the Jupyter Notebook server for the changes to take effect.\n\n3. **Clear Browser Cache**:\n   - Sometimes, changes in `custom.js` may not take effect because of cached files in your web browser. Clearing your browser cache can help ensure that the changes are applied.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to change the autoindentation in your Jupyter Notebook to use 2 spaces instead of 4. Now, when you write code in the notebook, it should automatically indent using 2 spaces, adhering to your company's coding style."
