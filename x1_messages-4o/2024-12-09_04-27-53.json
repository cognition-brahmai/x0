        "content": "In Python, you can concatenate dictionaries to create a new one using several different methods. Here are a few ways to achieve this:\n\n### Method 1: Using the `update()` method\n\nYou can create an empty dictionary and then use the `update()` method to add the contents of the other dictionaries.\n\n```python\nd1 = {1: 2, 3: 4}\nd2 = {5: 6, 7: 9}\nd3 = {10: 8, 13: 22}\n\nd4 = {}\nd4.update(d1)\nd4.update(d2)\nd4.update(d3)\n\nprint(d4)\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using dictionary unpacking (Python 3.5+)\n\nIf you are using Python 3.5 or later, you can use dictionary unpacking with the `**` operator.\n\n```python\nd1 = {1: 2, 3: 4}\nd2 = {5: 6, 7: 9}\nd3 = {10: 8, 13: 22}\n\nd4 = {**d1, **d2, **d3}\n\nprint(d4)\n```\n\n### Method 3: Using the `|` operator (Python 3.9+)\n\nIn Python 3.9 and later, you can use the `|` operator to merge dictionaries.\n\n```python\nd1 = {1: 2, 3: 4}\nd2 = {5: 6, 7: 9}\nd3 = {10: 8, 13: 22}\n\nd4 = d1 | d2 | d3\n\nprint(d4)\n```\n\nAll of these methods will give you the desired result:\n\n```python\n{1: 2, 3: 4, 5: 6, 7: 9, 10: 8, 13: 22}\n```\n\nChoose the method that best suits your Python version and style preference."
