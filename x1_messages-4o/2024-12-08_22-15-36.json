Here's a concise definition of artificial intelligence using LaTeX formatting:\n\n```latex\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is defined as the branch of computer science aimed at creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI systems employ algorithms, data, and computational power to mimic cognitive functions and can be categorized into narrow AI, which is task-specific, and general AI, which aspires to understand and perform any intellectual task a human can do.\n```"
