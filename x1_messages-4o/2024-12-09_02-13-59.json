        "content": "Can anyone explain why the unary (*) operator cannot be used in an expression involving iterators, lists or tuples in Python? I am under the impression that it is limited to function unpacking. For example, the expression [1,2,3, *[4,5,6]] results in a SyntaxError. However, when the * operator is used with a function call, it does expand, such as f(*[4, 5, 6]) which is equivalent to f(4, 5, 6). Also, there seems to be a similarity between the + and the * when using lists but not when extending a list with another type. For instance, the expression [] + gen, where gen is a generator, throws a TypeError."

        "content": "In Python, the unary `*` operator is known as the \"splat\" operator and is used for unpacking iterables. Its behavior can indeed be a bit confusing because it has specific use cases, and its functionality depends on the context in which it's used.\n\n1. **Unpacking in Function Calls:**\n   - When used in function calls, the `*` operator is used to unpack a list, tuple, or any iterable into positional arguments. For example, `f(*[4, 5, 6])` passes `4`, `5`, and `6` as separate arguments to the function `f`.\n\n2. **Unpacking in Literals (Python 3.5+):**\n   - Starting from Python 3.5, the `*` operator can be used within list, tuple, and set literals to unpack iterables. For instance, `[1, 2, 3, *[4, 5, 6]]` results in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. If you're getting a `SyntaxError` with this expression, it might be because you are using a version of Python earlier than 3.5.\n\n3. **Concatenation with `+`:**\n   - The `+` operator can be used to concatenate lists and tuples, but it expects both operands to be of the same type. Hence, `[] + [1, 2, 3]` works, but `[] + gen` (where `gen` is a generator) throws a `TypeError` because a generator is not directly concatenable with a list.\n\n4. **Extending with Iterables:**\n   - To extend a list with elements from another iterable, such as a generator, you can use the `extend()` method or unpacking with `*`. For example, `my_list.extend(gen)` or `[*my_list, *gen]`.\n\nThe use of `*` in unpacking within literals is highly contextual and is designed to enhance readability and flexibility by allowing the direct combination of lists and other iterables. Understanding these specific contexts where `*` is applicable can help avoid errors and make your code more expressive and concise."
