Here is the code for my plot.\n\n```python\nx = linspace(0.2,10,100)\nplot(x, 1/x)\nplot(x, log(x))\naxis('equal')\ngrid()\n```\n\nI've tried referring to a previous [stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4694478/center-origin-in-matplotlib) where the accepted answer suggests using 'Axis spine'. However, I found the example too complex as it uses subplots. Can someone demonstrate how to use 'Axis spine' in my simple example?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can use the concept of \"spines\" in Matplotlib to emphasize the x and y axes by moving them to the center. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve that:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\nx = np.linspace(0.2, 10, 100)\nplt.plot(x, 1/x, label='1/x')\nplt.plot(x, np.log(x), label='log(x)')\n\n# Set the aspect of the plot to be equal\nplt.axis('equal')\n\n# Emphasize the x and y axes by moving the spines\nax = plt.gca()  # Get the current axis\n\n# Move the bottom spine to y=0 (x-axis)\nax.spines['bottom'].set_position('zero')\n\n# Move the left spine to x=0 (y-axis)\nax.spines['left'].set_position('zero')\n\n# Hide the top and right spines\nax.spines['top'].set_color('none')\nax.spines['right'].set_color('none')\n\n# Add grid\nplt.grid()\n\n# Optionally, add labels and legend\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('y')\nplt.legend()\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `plt.gca()` retrieves the current axis in the plot.\n- `set_position('zero')` moves the specified spine to the zero position, effectively centering the x and y axes.\n- `set_color('none')` hides the top and right spines, which are not needed when the x and y axes are emphasized.\n\nThis code should help you emphasize the origin axes in your plot while keeping the grid."
