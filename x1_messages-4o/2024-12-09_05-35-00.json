I have some asyncio code that runs well in the Python interpreter (CPython 3.6.2) and I would like to run it in a Jupyter notebook with an IPython kernel. I can run it using `asyncio.get_event_loop().run_forever()`, but this seems to block the notebook. I tried installing a Tornado event loop as recommended in the Tornado docs but it resulted in an AssertionError. I then tried to add a cell with the code provided on the ipywidgets documentation which seemed to work, but I don't understand how or why. Could someone explain this to me?"

        "content": "Running asyncio code in a Jupyter notebook can be a bit tricky due to the way event loops are handled. Here's how you can effectively run asyncio code in a Jupyter notebook and understand the underlying mechanics.\n\n### Understanding the Issue\n\nJupyter notebooks run on top of IPython, which uses Tornado as its web server framework. Tornado itself has its own event loop, which can conflict with Python's asyncio event loop if not managed properly. The key is to ensure that the asyncio event loop integrates smoothly with the Tornado loop used by Jupyter.\n\n### Solutions\n\n1. **Using `nest_asyncio`**:\n   \n   One of the simplest ways to resolve issues with asyncio in Jupyter is to use the `nest_asyncio` package. It allows you to run nested event loops, which is often required in interactive environments like Jupyter notebooks.\n\n   First, install the package:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install nest_asyncio\n   ```\n\n   Then, at the top of your notebook, run:\n\n   ```python\n   import nest_asyncio\n   nest_asyncio.apply()\n   ```\n\n   This will patch the event loop to allow nested usage, which works well in Jupyter environments.\n\n2. **Using Jupyter/IPython Magic Commands**:\n\n   IPython provides a magic command `%%asyncio` that can be used to run asyncio code directly in a cell. This command handles the event loop integration for you.\n\n   ```python\n   # Example asyncio function\n   async def my_async_function():\n       await asyncio.sleep(1)\n       print(\"Hello from asyncio!\")\n\n   # Run the function using asyncio magic\n   %autoawait asyncio\n   await my_async_function()\n   ```\n\n3. **Running Event Loop Manually**:\n\n   If you want more control, you can also run the asyncio event loop manually in a Jupyter notebook. Here\u2019s an example:\n\n   ```python\n   import asyncio\n\n   async def my_async_function():\n       await asyncio.sleep(1)\n       print(\"Hello from asyncio!\")\n\n   loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n   task = loop.create_task(my_async_function())\n   loop.run_until_complete(task)\n   ```\n\n   However, using `nest_asyncio` is generally preferred for simplicity and to avoid potential conflicts.\n\n### Explanation\n\nWhen you run an asyncio event loop with `asyncio.get_event_loop().run_forever()` in a Jupyter notebook, it blocks the kernel because it enters a continuous, never-ending loop. This prevents any further execution of notebook cells until the loop is manually stopped.\n\nThe `nest_asyncio.apply()` method allows the existing event loop to be re-entered, effectively allowing nested event loops. This is particularly useful in interactive environments where you don't want the current loop to block further execution or other asynchronous operations.\n\nBy using these methods, you integrate asyncio's event loop with Jupyter's event handling, allowing asynchronous code to run smoothly without blocking the notebook interface."
