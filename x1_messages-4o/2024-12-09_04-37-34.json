I would like to comment out either selected lines in visual mode or n lines above/below the current cursor position. For example, I would like to transform the following code:\n\n```python\ndef my_fun(x, y):\n    return x + y\n```\n\ninto:\n\n```python\n#def my_fun(x, y):\n#    return x + y\n```\n\nI am okay with using either '#' or '\"\"\"' to comment out the relevant lines. Ideally, I would also like the same keymapping to uncomment the lines if they have been previously commented out."

        "content": "To achieve commenting and uncommenting lines of code in Vim, you can use a custom key mapping. This can be done by defining a function in your `.vimrc` file that can toggle comments on the lines. Below is an example of how you can set this up:\n\n1. **Add the following function and mappings to your `.vimrc` file:**\n\n```vim\n\" Function to toggle comments\nfunction! ToggleComment()\n    let l:comment_char = '#'\n    if getline('.') =~ '^' . l:comment_char\n        \" Uncomment the line\n        execute \"normal! ^x\"\n    else\n        \" Comment the line\n        execute \"normal! I\" . l:comment_char\n    endif\nendfunction\n\n\" Key mapping to toggle comments in normal mode\nnnoremap <Leader>c :call ToggleComment()<CR>\n\n\" Key mapping to toggle comments in visual mode\nvnoremap <Leader>c :'<,'>s/^/#/<CR>gv\nvnoremap <Leader>u :'<,'>s/^#//<CR>gv\n```\n\n2. **Explanation:**\n   - `ToggleComment`: This function checks if the current line starts with the comment character `#`. If it does, it removes the comment; otherwise, it adds the comment character at the beginning.\n   - `nnoremap <Leader>c`: This sets up a key mapping in normal mode to call the `ToggleComment` function. `<Leader>` is a placeholder for your leader key, often set as `\\` by default.\n   - `vnoremap <Leader>c` and `vnoremap <Leader>u`: These are key mappings in visual mode to comment and uncomment the selected lines, respectively. The `gv` command reselects the text so you can see the result of the operation.\n\n3. **Usage:**\n   - In normal mode, place the cursor on the line you wish to comment/uncomment and press `<Leader>c` to toggle the comment.\n   - In visual mode, select the lines you want to comment or uncomment and press `<Leader>c` to comment or `<Leader>u` to uncomment the lines.\n\nAdjust the mappings and the comment character as needed for your preferences and specific programming language. This setup should give you flexible commenting capabilities in Vim."
