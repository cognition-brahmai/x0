In my test file, I have the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom mock import patch,\nfrom ..monkey import ook\n\n@patch('monkey.ook', Mock(return_value=None))\ndef test_run_ook (self, mock_ook):\n    self.assertIsNone(ook())\n    mock_ook.run.assert_called_once_with('')\n```\nHowever, when I run this test, I face an ImportError stating `No module named monkey`. It seems like the path I am patching is incorrect. How can I correct it without altering `sys.path` or `PYTHONPATH`?"

        "content": "When using `patch` for mocking in Python, the path you provide should be the fully qualified name as it's imported in the module you're testing. If you're facing an `ImportError` stating `No module named monkey`, it likely means the path you're trying to patch isn't correct relative to where the test is being executed.\n\nHere's how you can fix the patching issue:\n\n1. **Identify the Correct Import Path**: You need to patch the object as it is imported in the module you are testing, not necessarily how it is defined in its own module.\n\n2. **Use the Correct Path**: If your test file is at the same level as `monkey.py` or in a directory parallel to it, you should patch it relative to your test module's namespace.\n\nHere's an example of how you might adjust your patching:\n\n```python\nfrom unittest.mock import patch, Mock\nfrom ..monkey import ook  # Assuming monkey.py is a sibling of the test module\n\n@patch('your_test_module_name.monkey.ook', new=Mock(return_value=None))\ndef test_run_ook(self, mock_ook):\n    self.assertIsNone(ook())\n    mock_ook.assert_called_once_with('')\n```\n\n### Steps to Determine the Correct Path:\n\n1. **Check Your Project Structure**: Understand where `monkey.py` is located relative to your test module. If your test module is in `tests/test_monkey.py`, and `monkey.py` is in the same package, then `from ..monkey import ook` is correct, but you must patch as it appears in the test.\n\n2. **Patch the Usage, Not the Definition**: Patch `ook` where it's used in the module you are testing. For example, if you're testing a function in `tests/test_monkey.py` that uses `ook` from `monkey.py`, you should patch `tests.monkey.ook`.\n\n3. **Run the Test from the Correct Directory**: Ensure that you are running your tests from the correct directory where the relative imports make sense. Sometimes running from the root directory of your project helps.\n\nIf your directory structure looks like this:\n\n```\n/project\n    /package\n        __init__.py\n        monkey.py\n        /tests\n            __init__.py\n            test_monkey.py\n```\nIn `test_monkey.py`, you would patch like this:\n\n```python\n@patch('package.monkey.ook', new=Mock(return_value=None))\n```\n\nMake sure your `__init__.py` files are present to treat directories as packages. This way, the import system can resolve the paths correctly."
