Here's a brief structure of the DataFrame:\n\n```python\nIndex   Id   Type\n0       a1   A\n1       a2   A\n2       b1   B\n3       b3   B\n4       a1   A\n...\n```\n\nWhen I try to get a list of unique IDs using `uniqueId = df[\"Id\"].unique()`, I do get a list of unique IDs. However, I want to apply this filtering on the whole DataFrame such that it keeps the structure but the duplicates (based on \"Id\") are removed. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To remove duplicate rows based on the \"Id\" column from your DataFrame while keeping the first occurrence of each unique ID, you can use the `drop_duplicates` method provided by pandas. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming df is your DataFrame\ndf_unique = df.drop_duplicates(subset='Id', keep='first')\n\n# Display the DataFrame with duplicates removed\nprint(df_unique)\n```\n\nHere\u2019s what each part does:\n\n- `subset='Id'`: This specifies that duplicates should be identified based on the \"Id\" column.\n- `keep='first'`: This tells pandas to keep the first occurrence of each duplicated \"Id\" and remove subsequent duplicates.\n\nThis will give you a DataFrame where each \"Id\" appears only once, retaining the first occurrence of each unique \"Id\". If you'd like to keep the last occurrence instead, you can set `keep='last'`."
