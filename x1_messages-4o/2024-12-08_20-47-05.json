        "content": "To solve this problem using MATLAB, we need to calculate the number of triangles that can be formed from a given set of points. The formula you've provided helps in identifying the number of non-degenerate triangles (those that have a non-zero area) from a set of points.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown and corresponding MATLAB code to implement the solution:\n\n1. **Calculate nC3**: This is the total number of ways to choose 3 points out of n, which corresponds to all possible triangles, including degenerate ones (collinear).\n\n2. **Subtract collinear cases**: The formula subtracts 3nC1 and nC2 to account for collinear points, ensuring we only count non-degenerate triangles.\n\nHowever, the formula provided seems incorrect for directly calculating non-degenerate triangles. Instead, we need to check each combination of three points to determine if they form a valid triangle (non-collinear). A valid triangle is formed if the area is non-zero.\n\nHere's the MATLAB code to calculate the number of non-degenerate triangles:\n\n```matlab\nfunction numTriangles = countTriangles(points)\n    % points is an n x 2 matrix where each row represents a point (x, y)\n\n    n = size(points, 1);\n    numTriangles = 0;\n\n    % Iterate over all combinations of 3 points\n    for i = 1:n-2\n        for j = i+1:n-1\n            for k = j+1:n\n                % Extract the coordinates of the points\n                x1 = points(i, 1); y1 = points(i, 2);\n                x2 = points(j, 1); y2 = points(j, 2);\n                x3 = points(k, 1); y3 = points(k, 2);\n                \n                % Use the determinant method to check if points are collinear\n                if (x1*(y2 - y3) + x2*(y3 - y1) + x3*(y1 - y2)) ~= 0\n                    numTriangles = numTriangles + 1;\n                end\n            end\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Combination Iteration**: We iterate over all possible combinations of three points from the given set.\n\n- **Collinearity Check**: We use the determinant method to determine if three points are collinear. The determinant is calculated as:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)\n  \\]\n  If the area is zero, the points are collinear; otherwise, they form a triangle.\n\n- **Counting Valid Triangles**: We increase the count for each valid triangle found.\n\nBy running this MATLAB function with a matrix of point coordinates, you can determine the number of non-degenerate triangles that can be formed."
