I want to be able to edit all related fields on one page. Is it possible to have a OneToOne relation as an Inline? If not, what's the best way to add a few fields to a given admin page that will be saved into the OneToOne relation? Here's an example of my models:\n\n```\nclass Product(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    ...\n\nclass MyProduct(models.Model):\n    product = models.OneToOne(Product)\n    ...\n```\n\nI tried setting up my admin like this, but it doesn't work and seems to expect a Foreign Key:\n\n```\nclass ProductInline(admin.StackedInline):\n    model = Product\n    fields = ('name',)\n\nclass MyProductAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    inlines = (AlbumProductInline,)\n\nadmin.site.register(MyProduct, MyProductAdmin)\n```\n\nThis throws the error: `<class 'satchmo.product.models.Product'> has no ForeignKey to <class 'my_app.models.MyProduct'>`. I also tried adding the fields directly, but this also doesn't work:\n\n```\nclass AlbumAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    fields = ('product__name',)\n```\n\nIs the only way to do this a Custom Form?"

        "content": "To achieve what you want, you can indeed handle OneToOne relationships by using a custom admin form or leveraging Django's `InlineModelAdmin` with some adjustments. Since `OneToOneField` is essentially a specialized `ForeignKey`, you can manage it through a different approach. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you set it up:\n\n### Step 1: Define a Custom Form\n\nYou can create a custom form for your `MyProduct` model that will include fields from the `Product` model.\n\n```python\nfrom django import forms\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom .models import Product, MyProduct\n\nclass MyProductForm(forms.ModelForm):\n    product_name = forms.CharField(max_length=100)\n\n    class Meta:\n        model = MyProduct\n        fields = ['product_name', ...]\n\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super(MyProductForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n        if self.instance and self.instance.product:\n            self.fields['product_name'].initial = self.instance.product.name\n\n    def save(self, commit=True):\n        instance = super(MyProductForm, self).save(commit=False)\n        product, created = Product.objects.get_or_create(id=instance.product.id)\n        product.name = self.cleaned_data['product_name']\n        product.save()\n        instance.product = product\n        if commit:\n            instance.save()\n        return instance\n```\n\n### Step 2: Customize the Admin\n\nUse this form in your admin class to manage `MyProduct` with the `Product` fields inline.\n\n```python\nclass MyProductAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    form = MyProductForm\n    fields = ['product_name', ...]\n\nadmin.site.register(MyProduct, MyProductAdmin)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Explanation\n\n- **Custom Form**: This form handles the `OneToOneField` by extending the `MyProduct` form to include fields from the related `Product`. The `product_name` field is initialized with the current name of the related `Product`, and the form's `save` method manages saving both the `Product` and `MyProduct` instances.\n\n- **Admin Integration**: By using this custom form in your `MyProductAdmin`, you can edit fields from both `MyProduct` and `Product` on a single admin page.\n\nThis approach allows you to manage `OneToOne` relationships effectively in the Django admin without directly using inlines, which expect a `ForeignKey` relationship. By using a custom form, you can have more fine-grained control over how related fields are displayed and saved."
