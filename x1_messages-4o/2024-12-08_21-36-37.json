Your task is to write a program that can convert different units of time, such as seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years, using logical reasoning. The AI systems will not be able to help you this time, so get ready to put your puzzle-solving skills to the test!\nTo help you get started, here is an example of how to convert 24 hours to days using logical reasoning:\n- There are 24 hours in a day.\n- Therefore, to convert 24 hours to days, we divide 24 by the number of hours in a day, which is 24.\n- The result is 1 day.\nNow it's your turn! Can you figure out how to convert the following units of time using logical reasoning?\n- 120 seconds to minutes\n- 180 minutes to hours\n- 720 hours to days\n- 42 days to weeks\n- 12 weeks to months\n- 2 years to months\nRemember, you cannot use any code or formulas to solve these puzzles. You must use logical reasoning to arrive at the correct answer. Good luck!"

        "content": "Sure! Let's use logical reasoning to convert the given units of time:\n\n1. **120 seconds to minutes:**\n   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.\n   - To convert 120 seconds to minutes, divide 120 by the number of seconds in a minute, which is 60.\n   - \\( \\frac{120}{60} = 2 \\)\n   - Therefore, 120 seconds is equivalent to 2 minutes.\n\n2. **180 minutes to hours:**\n   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n   - To convert 180 minutes to hours, divide 180 by the number of minutes in an hour, which is 60.\n   - \\( \\frac{180}{60} = 3 \\)\n   - Therefore, 180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours.\n\n3. **720 hours to days:**\n   - There are 24 hours in a day.\n   - To convert 720 hours to days, divide 720 by the number of hours in a day, which is 24.\n   - \\( \\frac{720}{24} = 30 \\)\n   - Therefore, 720 hours is equivalent to 30 days.\n\n4. **42 days to weeks:**\n   - There are 7 days in a week.\n   - To convert 42 days to weeks, divide 42 by the number of days in a week, which is 7.\n   - \\( \\frac{42}{7} = 6 \\)\n   - Therefore, 42 days is equivalent to 6 weeks.\n\n5. **12 weeks to months:**\n   - There are approximately 4 weeks in a month (assuming a month is about 30 days).\n   - To convert 12 weeks to months, divide 12 by the number of weeks in a month, which is 4.\n   - \\( \\frac{12}{4} = 3 \\)\n   - Therefore, 12 weeks is approximately equivalent to 3 months.\n\n6. **2 years to months:**\n   - There are 12 months in a year.\n   - To convert 2 years to months, multiply 2 by the number of months in a year, which is 12.\n   - \\( 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\)\n   - Therefore, 2 years is equivalent to 24 months.\n\nI hope this helps!
