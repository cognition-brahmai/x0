This implementation uses the Bubble Sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(numbers):\n    n = len(numbers)\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Track whether any elements were swapped during this iteration\n        swapped = False\n        for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n            if numbers[j] > numbers[j+1]:\n                # Swap the elements\n                numbers[j], numbers[j+1] = numbers[j+1], numbers[j]\n                swapped = True\n        # If no elements were swapped, the list is already sorted\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n    return numbers\n\n# List of numbers\nnumbers = [10, 5, 8, 2, 1, 7, 3]\n\n# Sort the list\nsorted_numbers = bubble_sort(numbers)\n\n# Print the sorted list\nprint(sorted_numbers)\n```\n\nThis program defines a `bubble_sort` function that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It keeps iterating through the list until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted."
