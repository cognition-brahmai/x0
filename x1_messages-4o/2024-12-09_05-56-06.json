I came across a solution using `arg=None`, but I'm having trouble understanding why it works. For instance, consider the following two functions:\n\n```python\n# BAD: if `a_list` is not passed in, the default will wrongly retain its contents between successive function calls\ndef bad_append(new_item, a_list=[]):\n    a_list.append(new_item)\n    return a_list\n\n# GOOD: if `a_list` is not passed in, the default will always correctly be []\ndef good_append(new_item, a_list=None):\n    if a_list is None:\n        a_list = []\n    a_list.append(new_item)\n    return a_list\n```\n\nI understand that `a_list` is initialized only when the `def` statement is first encountered. Hence, subsequent calls of `bad_append` use the same list object. However, I'm struggling to understand how `good_append` works differently. It seems to me that `a_list` would still be initialized only once, meaning the `if` statement would only be true on the first invocation of the function, causing `a_list` to get reset to `[]` only on the first invocation. This seems like it would still accumulate all past `new_item` values and still be buggy. Could you explain why this is not the case? How does `a_list` get wiped clean every time `good_append` runs?"

        "content": "Certainly! The confusion often arises from the subtlety of how default arguments work in Python. Let's break it down:\n\n### Mutable Default Argument Problem\n\nIn Python, default argument values are evaluated only once when the function is defined, not each time the function is called. This is why the `bad_append` function behaves unexpectedly. It uses a mutable default argument (`a_list=[]`), which is shared across all calls to the function. This means that if the list is modified (like appending an item), the default value is changed and retained for future calls.\n\n### Why `good_append` Works\n\nThe `good_append` function avoids this issue by using `None` as the default value for `a_list`. Here's why it works:\n\n1. **Default Argument as None**: \n   - When `good_append` is called without an explicit `a_list`, the default value `None` is used.\n\n2. **Conditional Initialization**:\n   - Inside the function, there's a check: `if a_list is None:`.\n   - If `a_list` is indeed `None` (which it will be if no argument was passed), a new list `[]` is created and assigned to `a_list`.\n\n3. **New List Creation on Each Call**:\n   - This means that each time `good_append` is called without an `a_list`, a new empty list is created.\n   - Therefore, modifications to this list (like appending items) do not affect other calls to the function, because each call gets its own separate list.\n\n### Why It Doesn't Accumulate\n\n- Every call to `good_append` with no `a_list` argument passed results in a fresh, new list being created within the function, due to the `if a_list is None:` check.\n- This ensures that changes to the list (like appending `new_item`) are isolated to that specific function call.\n- As a result, each invocation starts with a \"clean slate,\" preventing the accumulation of items from previous calls.\n\nIn summary, the key difference is that `good_append` creates a new list every time it's called without an input list, whereas `bad_append` reuses the same list across all calls. This is why `good_append` doesn't accumulate items and behaves as expected."
