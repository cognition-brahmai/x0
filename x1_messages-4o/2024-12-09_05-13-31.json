I have tried creating new DNS links for the database but it has not resolved the issue. My system links look like this: [System DNS screenshot](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KZ3cD.png). Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport time\nimport pyodbc\n\nLOCATION = \"c:\\Users\\Marcello\\Desktop\\DATA\\ScorMonitor.db\"\n\ncnxn = pyodbc.connect(r\"Driver={{Microsoft Paradox Driver (*.db )}};Fil=Paradox 5.X;DefaultDir={0};Dbq={0}; CollatingSequence=ASCII;\")\ncursor = cnxn.cursor()\ncursor.execute(\"select last, first from test\")\nrow = cursor.fetchone()\nprint row\n```\n\nWhat could be causing this error and how can I fix it?"

        "content": "The error message you're seeing, `pyodbc.Error: ('IM002', '[IM002] [Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Data source name not found and no default driver specified (0) (SQLDriverConnect)`, suggests that the ODBC driver for Paradox is not properly installed or the connection string is incorrect. Here are some steps and suggestions to help you resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify ODBC Driver Installation:**\n   - Ensure that the Microsoft Paradox ODBC driver is installed on your system. You can check this by opening the ODBC Data Source Administrator (odbcad32.exe) and looking under the Drivers tab for the Paradox driver.\n\n2. **Correct the Driver Name in Connection String:**\n   - The driver name in your connection string may be incorrect. Instead of using `Driver={{Microsoft Paradox Driver (*.db )}}`, try using `Driver={Microsoft Paradox Driver (*.db)}` or `Driver={Microsoft Paradox Driver}` without the extra spaces or specific file extensions.\n\n3. **Use Proper File Path:**\n   - Make sure the file path to your database is correct. In your code, you have `c:\\Users\\Marcello\\Desktop\\DATA\\ScorMonitor.db`. Ensure this path is correct and the file exists at this location.\n\n4. **Database File Type:**\n   - Verify that the file `ScorMonitor.db` is actually a Paradox database file. The file extension `.db` is commonly used for various database types, so ensure it's a Paradox file.\n\n5. **32-bit vs 64-bit Driver:**\n   - Make sure you are using the correct version (32-bit or 64-bit) of the ODBC driver that matches your Python installation. If you're using a 32-bit version of Python, you need a 32-bit ODBC driver, and similarly for 64-bit.\n\n6. **DNS Configuration:**\n   - If you have set up a DSN (Data Source Name) for the Paradox database, make sure it is configured correctly and the DSN name is properly referenced in your connection string.\n\n7. **Check Connection String:**\n   - Update your connection string to reference the DSN if you have one set up:\n\n     ```python\n     cnxn = pyodbc.connect('DSN=YourDSNName')\n     ```\n\n   - Or, ensure that the connection string is complete and has all required parameters.\n\n8. **Administrative Privileges:**\n   - Run your script with administrative privileges, as sometimes accessing certain data sources requires elevated permissions.\n\nIf after checking all these steps you still encounter issues, consider consulting the documentation for the specific ODBC driver you are using, as there might be additional configuration steps or nuances specific to that driver. Additionally, if possible, test the connection using a different tool (like a database management tool) to confirm that the issue is with the connection string or driver setup."
