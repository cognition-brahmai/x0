However, when I enter \"python\" in my shell, it shows that version 2.7 is currently active, as shown by this output:\n\n```\nPython 2.7.1 (r271:86832, Jun 16 2011, 16:59:05) \n[GCC 4.2.1 (Based on Apple Inc. build 5658) (LLVM build 2335.15.00)] on darwin\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>>\n```\n\nHow can I change the active Python version to 2.5?"

        "content": "To change the active Python version using MacPorts on your system, you need to use the `port select` command to set the desired version. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **List Available Versions**: You've already done this, but for reference, the command is:\n   ```bash\n   port select --list python\n   ```\n\n2. **Select the Desired Version**: You want to select Python 2.5, so you'll use the `port select` command to set it as the default. You can do this with:\n   ```bash\n   sudo port select --set python python25\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify the Change**: After setting the desired version, verify that Python 2.5 is now the active version by checking the Python version:\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   ```\n   or\n   ```bash\n   python -V\n   ```\n\nIf everything is set up correctly, the `python` command should now point to Python 2.5. If it doesn't, make sure that there are no other conflicting paths set in your shell configuration files such as `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, or `.zshrc`, which might be pointing to a different Python version. Adjust these files if necessary to ensure that the MacPorts path has precedence."
