In the process, I have encountered several issues and have managed to resolve most of them using the \"options\" in the setup file. However, I am currently facing a problem that I have not been able to solve. When I execute the setup file using \"python setup.py py2exe\", it generates an executable. But when I run this executable, it returns an error stating \"No module named builtins\". I have found information suggesting that \"builtins\" is related to Python 3, but as mentioned, I am using Python 2.7. Here is the setup file I am using:\n\n```python\nfrom distutils.core import setup\nimport py2exe\n\nfrom distutils.filelist import findall\nimport os\nimport matplotlib\nmatplotlibdatadir = matplotlib.get_data_path()\nmatplotlibdata = findall(matplotlibdatadir)\n\nsetup(\n    console=['DET14.py'],\n    options={\n             'py2exe': {\n                        'packages' : ['matplotlib', 'pytz'],\n                        'dll_excludes':['MSVCP90.DLL',\n                                        'libgdk-win32-2.0-0.dll',\n                                        'libgobject-2.0-0.dll',\n                                        'libgdk_pixbuf-2.0-0.dll'],\n                        'includes':['scipy.sparse.csgraph._validation',\n                            'scipy.special._ufuncs_cxx']\n                       }\n            },\n    data_files=matplotlib.get_py2exe_datafiles()\n)\n```\n\nAnd here is the error message I am receiving: [Error Message](https://i.stack.imgur.com/thzVU.jpg)\nCould you provide any advice or suggestions on how to resolve this issue?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"No module named builtins,\" is indeed related to the differences between Python 2 and Python 3. The `builtins` module is a Python 3 feature, and it seems like there may be some code or library that's trying to import it, which is likely causing the issue.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check for Python 3 Code:**\n   - Ensure that your code and all the libraries you are using are compatible with Python 2.7. Sometimes, a library may have been updated to require Python 3, even if it previously supported Python 2.\n\n2. **Library Versions:**\n   - Verify that the versions of libraries you are using are compatible with Python 2.7. You might need to downgrade certain libraries to versions that support Python 2.7.\n\n3. **Check for Conditional Imports:**\n   - Look through your code and any modules you are importing for conditional imports that might switch between Python 2 and 3.\n\n4. **Use `future` Module:**\n   - If your codebase has elements that are compatible with Python 3, check if the `future` module is being used. This module can sometimes introduce Python 3-style imports into Python 2 code. Ensure that there aren\u2019t any unnecessary imports that could be causing the issue.\n\n5. **Dependencies Analysis:**\n   - Use tools like `pipdeptree` to analyze dependencies and ensure none of them require Python 3.\n\n6. **Custom Imports:**\n   - If you have custom imports or scripts, make sure they aren't inadvertently importing `builtins`. You might find it necessary to explicitly handle imports for Python 2 compatibility.\n\n7. **Check Your Setup Script:**\n   - Ensure your `setup.py` script doesn't contain any Python 3 specific syntax or modules.\n\n8. **Verbose Output:**\n   - Run the `py2exe` command with verbose output enabled to see if you can catch where the `builtins` import is coming from. You can do this by adding `--verbose` to your command.\n\n9. **Isolation Testing:**\n   - Try creating a minimal script that just imports your main dependencies and see if you can still reproduce the error. This can help isolate whether the issue is with your code or with a library.\n\n10. **Consult Documentation:**\n    - Check the documentation for py2exe and any other tools you are using for any known issues with Python 2.7.\n\nIf these steps don't resolve the issue, it might be helpful to transition to a more modern setup that supports Python 3, given that Python 2 has reached end-of-life and many libraries no longer maintain compatibility with it."
