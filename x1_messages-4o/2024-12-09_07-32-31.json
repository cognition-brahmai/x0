However, when I try to run any of the test scripts, I get the following error: \"no CUDA-capable device is detected\". I've followed the steps on the \"getting started guide\" and made a script to create the character device files at startup. I also tried downgrading to driver 319.76 and installed the \"nvidia-current-updates\" and \"nvidia-settings-updates\" packages before installing the driver file. But I still get the error. How can I resolve this?"

        "content": "The \"no CUDA-capable device is detected\" error can be frustrating, but there are several steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve this issue. Here are some suggestions that might help:\n\n1. **Verify Driver Installation:**\n   - Make sure the NVIDIA drivers are installed correctly and are compatible with your GPU and CUDA version. You can check if the driver is installed by running `nvidia-smi` in the terminal. This command should display information about your GPU. If it shows an error or does not recognize the GPU, the driver installation may have issues.\n\n2. **Check CUDA Installation:**\n   - Ensure that the CUDA toolkit is installed correctly. You can verify the installation by checking if the CUDA samples are compiled properly. Navigate to the `NVIDIA_CUDA-5.5_Samples` directory and try running `make` to compile the samples.\n\n3. **Environment Variables:**\n   - Ensure that your environment variables are set correctly. Add the following lines to your `.bashrc` or relevant shell configuration file:\n     ```bash\n     export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-5.5/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}\n     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-5.5/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}\n     ```\n   - After adding these lines, run `source ~/.bashrc` to apply the changes.\n\n4. **Device Files:**\n   - Check that the character device files are set up correctly. You can manually create them by running:\n     ```bash\n     sudo /usr/bin/nvidia-smi\n     ```\n   - This command should automatically create the device files if they are missing.\n\n5. **Kernel Module:**\n   - Ensure that the NVIDIA kernel module is loaded. You can check this by running:\n     ```bash\n     lsmod | grep nvidia\n     ```\n   - If the module is not listed, try loading it manually with:\n     ```bash\n     sudo modprobe nvidia\n     ```\n\n6. **Compatibility:**\n   - Double-check the compatibility between your GPU, CUDA version, and driver version. The GTX 680 should be supported by CUDA 5.5, but ensure that the driver version you are using supports both the GPU and CUDA version.\n\n7. **Reboot:**\n   - After making changes, a reboot might be necessary to ensure all settings and modules are correctly applied.\n\n8. **Check for Errors:**\n   - Look for any error messages in the system logs (`/var/log/syslog` or `/var/log/kern.log`) to see if there are any indications of what might be going wrong.\n\nIf you've tried all the above steps and are still experiencing issues, consider updating your system to a newer version of Ubuntu and using a more recent version of CUDA and drivers, as they may offer better support and stability for your hardware."
