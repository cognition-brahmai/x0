        "content": "To replace the phrase \"master the subject\" with \"mastered this subject\" in a CSV file using Swift and the `sed` command, you can execute a shell command from within your Swift code. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\n// Define the path to your CSV file\nlet filePath = \"data.csv\"\n\n// Define the `sed` command to perform the replacement\nlet command = \"sed -i '3s/master the subject/mastered this subject/' \\(filePath)\"\n\n// Execute the command\nlet task = Process()\ntask.launchPath = \"/bin/bash\"\ntask.arguments = [\"-c\", command]\n\ndo {\n    try task.run()\n    task.waitUntilExit()\n    print(\"Replacement completed successfully.\")\n} catch {\n    print(\"An error occurred: \\(error.localizedDescription)\")\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`filePath`**: The path to your CSV file.\n- **`sed` Command**: \n  - `-i`: Edits the file in place.\n  - `3s/text1/text2/`: Targets the third line and performs the substitution.\n- **Process**: Used to execute shell commands from Swift.\n- **Error Handling**: Ensures that any issues are caught and logged.\n\nThis code will run the `sed` command to replace the specified phrase in the third row's second column of your CSV file. Make sure that the file path is correct and accessible from the location where your Swift code runs."
