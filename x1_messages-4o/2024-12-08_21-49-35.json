        "content": "The MATLAB code you provided already performs the necessary steps to check if two strings are anagrams of each other using sorting, which has a time complexity of \\(O(n \\log n)\\). The code sorts both strings and compares the resulting sorted strings to determine if they are anagrams. However, there are a few possible improvements to make it more concise or efficient in terms of readability:\n\n1. **Ensure Input Consistency**: Make sure both strings are in the same case, as MATLAB's `sort` function is case-sensitive.\n\n2. **Simplify Return Statement**: You can simplify the if-else statement by directly returning the comparison result.\n\nHere is the modified MATLAB code:\n\n```matlab\nfunction output = isAnagram(s1, s2)\n    % Ensure both strings are in the same case\n    s1 = lower(s1);\n    s2 = lower(s2);\n    \n    % Check if both strings have the same length\n    if length(s1) ~= length(s2)\n        output = false;\n        return;\n    end\n    \n    % Sort both strings and compare\n    output = isequal(sort(s1), sort(s2));\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Case Consistency**: We convert both strings to lowercase using `lower()` to ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.\n2. **Direct Comparison**: We use `isequal()` to directly compare the sorted versions of the strings, which returns true if they are equal and false otherwise. This reduces the need for an if-else statement.\n3. **Early Return**: If the strings are of different lengths, they cannot be anagrams, so we immediately return `false`.\n\nThis function now efficiently checks if two strings are anagrams of each other while maintaining the desired time complexity."
