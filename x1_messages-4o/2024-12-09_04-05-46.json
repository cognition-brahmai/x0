In a previous answer on Stack Overflow, it was suggested to use `add_subplot` instead of `add_axes` to show axes correctly. However, after checking the documentation, I am still unsure of when to use which function."

        "content": "Certainly! Understanding the differences between `add_axes` and `add_subplot` in Matplotlib is essential for effectively managing how plots are displayed in your figure.\n\n### `add_axes`\n\n- **Purpose**: `add_axes` allows you to place an axes object at a specific position in your figure using normalized figure coordinates.\n- **Usage**: You define the position and size of the axes in the form of a list `[left, bottom, width, height]`, where all values range from 0 to 1 and are relative to the figure dimensions.\n- **Flexibility**: This method gives you precise control over the position and size of the axes, which is useful if you need exact placement for custom layouts or insets.\n- **Example**:\n  ```python\n  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n  fig = plt.figure()\n  ax = fig.add_axes([0.1, 0.1, 0.8, 0.8])  # Position: 10% from left, 10% from bottom, 80% width, 80% height\n  ax.plot([0, 1], [0, 1])\n  plt.show()\n  ```\n\n### `add_subplot`\n\n- **Purpose**: `add_subplot` is designed to add a subplot to your figure using a grid layout. It is more intuitive for creating multi-plot figures.\n- **Usage**: You specify the number of rows and columns of the grid, and the index of the subplot you want to create. The subplot index follows row-major order (left to right, top to bottom).\n- **Convenience**: This method is more convenient for creating regular grids of subplots, like a 2x2 grid of plots. It automatically handles the layout for you.\n- **Example**:\n  ```python\n  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n  fig = plt.figure()\n  ax1 = fig.add_subplot(2, 2, 1)  # 2 rows, 2 columns, subplot 1\n  ax1.plot([0, 1], [0, 1])\n\n  ax2 = fig.add_subplot(2, 2, 2)  # 2 rows, 2 columns, subplot 2\n  ax2.plot([1, 0], [0, 1])\n\n  plt.show()\n  ```\n\n### When to Use Each\n\n- **Use `add_axes`** when you need precise control over the position and size of your axes, or when you are creating complex layouts that don't fit into a regular grid.\n  \n- **Use `add_subplot`** when you want to quickly create a grid of subplots and don't need the fine control over positioning. It's simpler and often sufficient for standard use cases involving multiple plots.\n\nIn summary, `add_axes` offers more flexibility and control, while `add_subplot` is more convenient for creating regular, grid-based layouts. Choose the one that best fits your specific plotting needs."
