To do so, I conducted a survey of 100 people and recorded their ages. The survey results showed that the sum of the ages of the people surveyed was 5,500. \nBased on this information, can you calculate the estimated average age of the people living in the village? Show your work and explain your reasoning.\nNote: Please round your answer to the nearest whole number."
