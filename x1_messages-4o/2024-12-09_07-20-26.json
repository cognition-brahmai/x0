I understand that UNIX absolute paths start with '/', while Windows absolute paths start with alphabet 'C:' or '\\' . Is there a standard function in Python that can perform this check?"

        "content": "Yes, Python provides a standard way to check if a given path is absolute or relative using the `os.path` module, which is cross-platform. The function you are looking for is `os.path.isabs()`. This function will return `True` if the given path is an absolute path and `False` if it is a relative path.\n\nHere's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Example paths\npath1 = '/home/user/documents'  # UNIX absolute path\npath2 = 'C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\documents'  # Windows absolute path\npath3 = 'documents/reports'  # Relative path\n\n# Checking if the paths are absolute\nprint(os.path.isabs(path1))  # True on UNIX\nprint(os.path.isabs(path2))  # True on Windows\nprint(os.path.isabs(path3))  # False\n```\n\nThe `os.path.isabs()` function works across different platforms by appropriately determining if a path is absolute based on the platform-specific characteristics, such as starting with a '/' on UNIX-like systems or a drive letter on Windows. This makes it convenient and reliable for cross-platform path checking."
