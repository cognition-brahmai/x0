However, I would like to use Python 2.7 as it has certain features that I need for my project. I've been advised against setting Python 2.7 as my default version. So, how can I install Python 2.7 and run it alongside Python 2.6 on my Ubuntu machine?"

You can use `wget` to download it directly:\n     ```bash\n     wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.x/Python-2.7.x.tgz\n     ```\n     Replace `2.7.x` with the actual version number you wish to download.\n   - Extract the downloaded file:\n     ```bash\n     tar -xvf Python-2.7.x.tgz\n     ```\n   - Navigate into the extracted directory:\n     ```bash\n     cd Python-2.7.x\n     ```\n   - Compile and install Python 2.7:\n     ```bash\n     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local\n     make\n     sudo make altinstall\n     ```\n     The `make altinstall` command will install Python 2.7 without overwriting the default Python version.\n\n2. **Run Python 2.7**:\n   - To run Python 2.7, you need to call it explicitly using `python2.7`:\n     ```bash\n     python2.7\n     ```\n   - Similarly, to install packages for Python 2.7, use `pip2.7`. If `pip` is not installed, you can install it using:\n     ```bash\n     wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/2.7/get-pip.py\n     sudo python2.7 get-pip.py\n     ```\n     After installation, you can use `pip2.7` to manage Python packages for Python 2.7.\n\n3. **Verify the Installation**:\n   - Check the installed Python versions:\n     ```bash\n     python --version   # Should give you Python 2.6.x\n     python2.7 --version  # Should give you Python 2.7.x\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you can have Python 2.7 installed and running alongside Python 2.6 without affecting your system's default Python version."
