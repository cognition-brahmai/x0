        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to the number of steps that the `predict_generator` is using to make predictions. In your case, it seems like the generator is generating predictions for each sample multiple times. Let's break down how to address this:\n\n1. **Understanding `predict_generator`:** \n   - The `predict_generator` method expects a generator and a `steps` parameter, which indicates how many batches to process. If not specified, it defaults to iterating over the entire dataset indefinitely, which may lead to making more predictions than intended.\n\n2. **Fixing the Code:**\n   - You need to specify the `steps` parameter based on the total number of images divided by the batch size.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nfrom keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator\n\n# Create the test data generator\ntest_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)\n\n# Create the test generator from the directory\ntest_generator = test_datagen.flow_from_directory(\n    test_dir,\n    target_size=(200, 200),\n    color_mode=\"rgb\",\n    shuffle=False,  # Ensure shuffle is set to False\n    class_mode='categorical',\n    batch_size=1)  # Set batch_size to 1 to get predictions for each image\n\n# Get the number of samples\nnb_samples = len(test_generator.filenames)\n\n# Predict using the model\npredict = model.predict_generator(test_generator, steps=nb_samples)\n\n# Optionally, if you want to print or check the predictions\nfor i, prediction in enumerate(predict):\n    print(f\"Prediction for image {i+1}: {prediction}\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Batch Size:** Set the `batch_size` to 1 in the `flow_from_directory` method. This ensures that each call to the generator returns a single image, making it easier to control the number of predictions.\n- **Steps:** Specify `steps=nb_samples` in the `predict_generator` method to ensure that the generator iterates over all images exactly once.\n- **Shuffle:** Ensure `shuffle=False` to maintain the order of images as they appear in the directory.\n\nBy following these adjustments, you should receive 14 predictions corresponding to your 14 images."
