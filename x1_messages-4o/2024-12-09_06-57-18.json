        "content": "When you run the command `py.test --cov-report html pytest/01_smoke.py`, it should indeed generate an HTML report of the coverage results. By default, the HTML report is typically placed in a directory named `htmlcov` in your current working directory. If you're not seeing it, here are a few things you can check:\n\n1. **Current Working Directory**: Make sure you're looking in the correct directory where you ran the pytest command. The `htmlcov` directory should be located in the same directory where you executed the command.\n\n2. **Verify Coverage Configuration**: Ensure that you have `pytest-cov` installed, as this plugin provides the coverage reporting feature. You can check your installed packages using `pip list`.\n\n3. **Check for Errors**: Review the terminal output when you run the command to see if there are any error messages or warnings that might indicate a problem with generating the report.\n\n4. **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary write permissions to create files in the directory where you're running the command.\n\n5. **Explicitly Specify Output Directory**: If you still can't find the report, try specifying the output directory explicitly using:\n   ```\n   py.test --cov=your_module --cov-report html:cov_html pytest/01_smoke.py\n   ```\n   This will create an `cov_html` directory with the HTML report.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to locate or correctly generate the HTML coverage report. If the problem persists, consider checking the documentation or seeking additional help from the community."
