        "content": "Welcome to the world of Python and SymPy! SymPy is a powerful library for symbolic mathematics and can be very helpful for solving systems of equations, even when they are underdetermined. An underdetermined system has fewer equations than unknowns, which often means it has infinitely many solutions. SymPy can help you find a general solution.\n\nHere's how you can solve the given system of equations using SymPy:\n\n1. First, install SymPy if you haven't already. You can do this using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install sympy\n   ```\n\n2. Now, you can use the following Python code to solve your system of equations:\n\n   ```python\n   from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n   # Define the variables\n   x, y, z = symbols('x y z')\n\n   # Define the equations\n   eq1 = Eq(x + y + z, 1)\n   eq2 = Eq(x + y + 2*z, 3)\n\n   # Solve the system of equations\n   solutions = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y, z), dict=True)\n\n   # Print the solutions\n   print(solutions)\n   ```\n\nThe `solve` function will return a list of solutions in terms of free variables. In this case, since the system is underdetermined, one of the variables will be free (e.g., `y` or `z`), and the solution will be expressed in terms of that free variable.\n\nRunning the code should give you an output that looks like this:\n\n   ```plaintext\n   [{x: 2 - z, y: -1, z: z}]\n   ```\n\nThis indicates that `x` and `z` are dependent, with `z` being the free variable. The solutions are expressed in terms of `z`:\n\n- \\( x = 2 - z \\)\n- \\( y = -1 \\)\n- \\( z = z \\)\n\nYou can choose any value for `z` to get a specific solution, but the general solution is described in terms of `z`."
