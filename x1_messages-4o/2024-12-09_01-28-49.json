        "content": "During a CUDA C project, I encountered unexpected behaviour with single precision and double precision floating point operations. Despite using double precision for all variables and arrays, single precision operations are being executed according to the NVPROF analysis of the program executable. I'm currently working on a Nvidia Tesla k40 graphics card. The issue arises when I run the division operation in the following code:\n\n```C\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <math.h>\n\n#define Nx 10\n#define Ny 10\n#define RANDOM double(0.236954587566)\n\n__global__ void test(double *array, size_t pitch){\n    double rho, u;\n    int x = threadIdx.x + blockDim.x*blockIdx.x;\n    int y = threadIdx.y + blockDim.y*blockIdx.y;\n    int idx = y*(pitch/sizeof(double)) + 2*x;\n\n    if(x < Nx && y < Ny){\n        rho = array[idx]; \n        u = array[idx+1]/rho;\n        array[idx] = rho*u;\n    }\n}\n\n__global__ void fill(double *array, size_t pitch){\n    int x = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;\n    int y = threadIdx.y + blockIdx.y * blockDim.y;  \n    int idx = y*(pitch/sizeof(double)) + 2*x;\n\n    if(x < Nx || y < Ny){\n        array[idx] = RANDOM*idx;\n        array[idx + 1] = idx*idx*RANDOM;\n    }\n}\n\nint main(int argc, char* argv[]) {\n    double *d_array;\n    size_t pitch;\n    cudaMallocPitch((void **) &d_array, &pitch, 2*Nx*sizeof(double), Ny);\n\n    dim3 threadDistribution = dim3(8,8);\n    dim3 blockDistribution = dim3( (Nx + threadDistribution.x - 1) / (threadDistribution.x), (Ny + threadDistribution.y - 1) / (threadDistribution.y));\n    fill <<< blockDistribution, threadDistribution >>> (d_array, pitch);\n    cudaDeviceSynchronize();\n    test <<< blockDistribution, threadDistribution >>> (d_array, pitch);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nIf I remove the division operation, the output shows zero single precision operations as expected. However, when the division operation is present, the program uses single precision flop and ten times more double precision floating point operations. I tried using intrinsics (__ddiv_rn) but the problem persists. Can someone help me understand why this is happening and how to solve it?"

        "content": "The behavior you're encountering is likely due to some quirks in how CUDA handles certain operations and optimizations. Here are some steps and considerations that may help you resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Compiler Flags**: Ensure you're compiling your CUDA code with the appropriate flags to enforce double precision operations. You should use `-arch=sm_35` or higher for Tesla K40 to ensure full support for double precision. Also, consider using `-prec-div=true` to improve the precision of the division operations.\n\n2. **CUDA Intrinsics**: While you've tried using `__ddiv_rn`, it's crucial to ensure its usage is correct. The intrinsic functions should be utilized directly within the kernel when precision is crucial, and they should replace standard division operations explicitly.\n\n3. **Code Optimization**: Sometimes, the compiler might optimize the code in unexpected ways. Ensure that your code does not hint any single precision usage inadvertently. You might want to temporarily disable optimizations using `-O0` and see if the behavior changes, as this can help identify if the optimization is the cause.\n\n4. **Check for Implicit Conversions**: Carefully check your code for any potential implicit conversions that might be occurring. This includes constants or any operations that might default to single precision. Ensure all constants are explicitly defined as double, for example, use `0.236954587566` as `0.236954587566`. This ensures that the constant is treated as a double.\n\n5. **Use of `__ldg()`**: If you are using the `__ldg()` intrinsic for loading from global memory, note that it can sometimes introduce single precision operations. Verify that all memory loads and stores are being handled correctly and as expected in double precision.\n\n6. **Inspect the PTX**: You can inspect the generated PTX code to see how the division operations are being translated. Look for any `div.rn.f64` versus `div.rn.f32` to confirm the precision being used.\n\n7. **CUDA Version**: Ensure you are using a CUDA toolkit version that fully supports double precision operations efficiently for your architecture.\n\n8. **Driver and Toolkit Compatibility**: Sometimes, mismatches between the CUDA version and the driver can lead to unexpected behaviors. Ensure both are up-to-date and compatible.\n\nIf you've gone through these steps and the problem persists, it might be worth reaching out on NVIDIA forums or checking for any known issues with the specific CUDA version and hardware you're using."
