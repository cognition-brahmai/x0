There are three kinds of 'age_units' in the DataFrame: 'Y' for years, 'D' for days, and 'W' for weeks. I want to create a new column 'AgeRange' and populate it with the following age ranges: '<2', '2-18', '18-35', '35-65', '65+'. I wrote a function to accomplish this, but I am getting a SyntaxError: invalid syntax. It seems to not accept the 'AND' operator. How can I correct this function to apply the correct age range for each row in the DataFrame?"

        "content": "To address the issue with your function, it's important to note that in Python, the logical operator for \"and\" is lowercase `and`, not uppercase `AND`. Additionally, you should ensure the function handles the conversion of ages from days and weeks into years, since your age ranges are presumably in years. Here's a corrected version of your function:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Example function to determine age range\ndef determine_age_range(row):\n    age = row['age']\n    unit = row['age_units']\n\n    # Convert age to years if necessary\n    if unit == 'D':\n        age_in_years = age / 365\n    elif unit == 'W':\n        age_in_years = age / 52\n    else:  # unit == 'Y'\n        age_in_years = age\n\n    # Determine the age range\n    if age_in_years < 2:\n        return '<2'\n    elif 2 <= age_in_years < 18:\n        return '2-18'\n    elif 18 <= age_in_years < 35:\n        return '18-35'\n    elif 35 <= age_in_years < 65:\n        return '35-65'\n    else:\n        return '65+'\n\n# Example DataFrame\n# df = pd.DataFrame({'age': [...], 'age_units': [...]})\n\n# Apply the function to create the 'AgeRange' column\ndf['AgeRange'] = df.apply(determine_age_range, axis=1)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Logical Operators**: In Python, use `and` instead of `AND`.\n2. **Conversion**: Convert days and weeks to years before applying the age ranges.\n3. **Apply Function**: Use `df.apply()` with `axis=1` to apply the function row-wise across the DataFrame.\n\nEnsure your DataFrame `df` has columns named `'age'` and `'age_units'`. This code should correctly categorize each row into the specified age ranges based on the given age and unit."
