I've implemented it using a try-except block that catches any potential exception, which although functional, seems to violate PEP8 guidelines that recommend mentioning specific exceptions whenever possible. How can I modify my code to be PEP8 compliant? Here's the current implementation:\n\n```python\nlist_of_functions = [f_a, f_b, f_c]\nfor current_function in list_of_functions:\n    try:\n        current_function()\n    except Exception:\n        print(traceback.format_exc())\n```"

        "content": "To make your code more PEP8 compliant and robust, it's a good practice to catch specific exceptions that you anticipate might be raised by the functions you're calling. This approach not only adheres to PEP8 guidelines but also provides you with more control over exception handling. However, if you're not sure which exceptions might be raised or if they vary across functions, you can start by identifying the most likely exceptions. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n1. **Identify Specific Exceptions:** Determine which exceptions are likely to be raised by each function. This might require you to look at the documentation or the implementation of those functions.\n\n2. **Catch Specific Exceptions:** Update the `except` block to catch these specific exceptions instead of the general `Exception`.\n\nHere's an example of how you might implement this:\n\n```python\nimport traceback\n\ndef f_a():\n    # Example implementation of f_a\n    pass\n\ndef f_b():\n    # Example implementation of f_b\n    pass\n\ndef f_c():\n    # Example implementation of f_c\n    pass\n\nlist_of_functions = [f_a, f_b, f_c]\n\nfor current_function in list_of_functions:\n    try:\n        current_function()\n    except (ValueError, TypeError, KeyError) as e:  # Replace with specific exceptions\n        print(f\"An error occurred in {current_function.__name__}: {e}\")\n        print(traceback.format_exc())\n    except Exception as e:\n        # Optionally handle unexpected exceptions separately\n        print(f\"Unexpected error in {current_function.__name__}: {e}\")\n        print(traceback.format_exc())\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Replace Specific Exceptions:** Replace `ValueError`, `TypeError`, `KeyError`, etc., with the specific exceptions you expect from your functions.\n- **Optional Catch-All:** You might still want a general `except Exception` block as a fallback for unexpected issues, but it should be used judiciously.\n- **Logging and Debugging:** Consider using logging instead of `print` statements for better control and record-keeping of errors.\n- **Function Names:** Using `current_function.__name__` helps identify which function caused the error, aiding in debugging.\n\nBy catching specific exceptions, you make your code more predictable and easier to maintain."
