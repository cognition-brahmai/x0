However, Pylint seems to consider it as an unused import. I don't want to entirely eliminate 'unused-import' warnings. Is there a way to ignore this one specific line in Pylint? I am open to solutions that involve modifying a configuration file, such as '.pylintrc', or using a direct command like 'pylint: disable-this-line-in-some-way'. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "You can disable Pylint warnings for a specific line by using an inline comment in your code. For your specific case, where you want to ignore the `unused-import` warning for the import statement, you can add a comment at the end of the line to disable just that warning. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport config.logging_settings  # pylint: disable=unused-import\n```\n\nThis comment tells Pylint to ignore the `unused-import` warning for that particular line.\n\nIf you want to manage such exceptions more systematically, you can modify the `.pylintrc` file. You can add a specific section for your project where you add this exception. However, this approach might be more useful for larger projects where multiple such exceptions are needed across various files.\n\nHere's a basic walkthrough of how you might adjust your `.pylintrc` file:\n\n1. Open (or create if it doesn't exist) the `.pylintrc` file in your project directory.\n2. Locate the section `[MESSAGES CONTROL]`.\n3. Use the `ignore-patterns` option to specify patterns of files or modules where `unused-import` should be ignored.\n\nHowever, modifying `.pylintrc` to ignore specific messages globally is not usually recommended if you only want to ignore them in a single instance. Using the inline comment is a more targeted and less intrusive approach.\n\nBy using the inline comment, you ensure that your code remains clean and maintainable, without globally disabling useful linting warnings."
