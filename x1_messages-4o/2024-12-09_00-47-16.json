        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `tf.contrib` has been deprecated and is no longer available in TensorFlow 2.x. You mentioned using `Tensorflow.13.1`, which seems to be a typo, as there is no TensorFlow version like that. If you meant TensorFlow 1.13.1, then `tf.contrib` should be available, but it's highly recommended to upgrade to TensorFlow 2.x for better support and features.\n\nHere are a few steps to resolve the issue:\n\n### If You Want to Stick with TensorFlow 1.x\n\n1. **Ensure Correct Version**: Make sure you have TensorFlow 1.13.1 installed using the following command:\n   ```bash\n   pip show tensorflow\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Correct Version**: If needed, uninstall any existing TensorFlow version and install TensorFlow 1.13.1:\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall tensorflow\n   pip install tensorflow==1.13.1\n   ```\n\n3. **Use Virtual Environment**: Consider using a virtual environment to manage dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n   pip install tensorflow==1.13.1\n   ```\n\n### Upgrade to TensorFlow 2.x\n\n1. **Install TensorFlow 2.x**:\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall tensorflow\n   pip install tensorflow\n   ```\n\n2. **Use `tf.compat.v1` for Compatibility**: If you need to use `tf.contrib.slim` functionality in TensorFlow 2.x, you might find some of the features in `tensorflow-addons` or use the compatibility mode:\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf\n   tf.disable_v2_behavior()\n   ```\n\n3. **Migrate to Alternatives**: Many features from `tf.contrib` have been moved to other libraries or have equivalent functionalities in TensorFlow 2.x. You might need to adapt your code to use these new libraries, such as `tensorflow-addons`, `keras`, or other specific modules.\n\n4. **Check Documentation**: Review the [TensorFlow migration guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/migrate) for more detailed instructions on upgrading your code from TensorFlow 1.x to 2.x.\n\nIf you provide more details about what you're trying to accomplish with `tf.contrib.slim`, I can suggest more specific alternatives in TensorFlow 2.x."
