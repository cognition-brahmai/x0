I have created a service account in Google Cloud Console with the 'Storage Admin' role which should ideally provide full control of GCS resources. When I run 'gcloud projects get-iam-policy my_project', it seems to confirm that the role was correctly selected as follows:\n\n``` \n- members:\n  - serviceAccount:my_sa@my_project.iam.gserviceaccount.com\n  role: roles/storage.admin\n- members:\n  - serviceAccount:my_sa@my_project.iam.gserviceaccount.com\n  role: roles/storage.objectAdmin\n- members:\n  - serviceAccount:my_sa@my_project.iam.gserviceaccount.com\n  role: roles/storage.objectCreator\n```\nAccording to the documentation, the 'roles/storage.admin' role should comprise permissions 'storage.objects.*' and 'storage.buckets.*'. However, when I try to use this service account with the Google Cloud Storage Client Library for Python, I get the following error: 'my_sa@my_project.iam.gserviceaccount.com does not have storage.objects.get access to my_project/my_bucket.' Why is the selected role not sufficient in this context?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering could be due to several reasons. While the 'roles/storage.admin' role should theoretically provide the necessary permissions for full control of Google Cloud Storage (GCS) resources, there might be specific nuances or configurations causing the access issue. Let's explore some potential reasons and solutions:\n\n1. **Propagation Delay**: Sometimes, there might be a delay in the propagation of IAM policy changes. Ensure that you've allowed some time for the permissions to take effect after assigning the role.\n\n2. **Resource-Specific Policies**: Check if there are any resource-specific IAM policies set at the bucket level which might be overriding the project-wide policies. Bucket-level IAM policies can restrict access even if the service account has broader permissions at the project level.\n\n3. **Organization Policies**: If your project is under an organization, there might be organization-level policies that override project-level roles and permissions.\n\n4. **Role Binding Errors**: Verify the role bindings again to make sure there are no typos or misconfigurations. You can use the Google Cloud Console or the `gcloud` CLI to re-check the applied policies.\n\n5. **Service Account Key**: Ensure that the service account key being used in your Python application is correct. Sometimes, using an outdated or incorrect key can lead to such access issues.\n\n6. **API Scopes**: If you're using OAuth 2.0, make sure that the necessary API scopes are included when obtaining access tokens. For GCS, this usually includes the scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.full_control`.\n\n7. **Google Cloud Libraries Version**: Ensure that you are using the latest version of the Google Cloud Storage Client Library for Python. Sometimes, older versions may have bugs or lack support for certain features.\n\n8. **Audit Logs**: Check the audit logs in Google Cloud to see if there's any more detailed information about why the access is being denied. This can often provide clues about misconfigurations or overriding policies.\n\nIf you've checked all of these and the issue persists, you might want to try adding explicit permissions using the `roles/storage.objectViewer` role, although it should be redundant with `roles/storage.admin`. It might also be helpful to test with a different service account to see if the issue is specific to the current one."
