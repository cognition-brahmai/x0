More specifically, I am unsure about the role of 'f' in print(f\"...\"). Here is a snippet of the code:\n\n```python\nargs = parser.parser_args()\n\nprint(f\"Input directory: {args.input_directory}\")\nprint(f\"Output directory: {args.output_directory}\")\n```\n\nWhat is the function of 'f' in the print statement?"

        "content": "In Python, the `f` in `print(f\"...\")` denotes an \"f-string\" or formatted string literal. Introduced in Python 3.6, f-strings provide a concise and readable way to embed expressions inside string literals using curly braces `{}`. When you use an f-string, any expression inside the curly braces `{}` is evaluated at runtime and formatted using the `str()` function by default. \n\nIn your code snippet:\n\n```python\nprint(f\"Input directory: {args.input_directory}\")\nprint(f\"Output directory: {args.output_directory}\")\n```\n\nThe `f` before the string indicates that it\u2019s an f-string, and it allows you to directly insert the value of `args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory` into the string. This is equivalent to using the `str.format()` method or concatenating strings, but it is generally more readable and easier to write.\n\nFor example, the line:\n\n```python\nprint(f\"Input directory: {args.input_directory}\")\n```\n\nWill output something like:\n\n```\nInput directory: /path/to/input\n```\n\nAssuming `args.input_directory` holds the value `\"/path/to/input\"`. F-strings are powerful because they can also handle more complex expressions, not just variable names."
