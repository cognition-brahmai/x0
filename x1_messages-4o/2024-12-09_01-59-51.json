I am trying to set a breakpoint at a specific line in my code using pdb, but the execution appears to pass directly through the breakpoint. Here are the commands I'm using:\n\n<pre><code>python -m pdb manage.py runserver\n(pdb) b core/views.py:22\nBreakpoint 2 at /Users/raphaelcruzeiro/Documents/Projects/pdb_test/core/views.py:22\n(Pdb) c\n</code></pre>\n\nHowever, the program doesn't pause at the breakpoint. Is there some command that I'm missing or not using correctly? The manual doesn't elaborate on setting breakpoints beyond what I'm already doing. Could you help me resolve this issue?"

        "content": "When you're using `pdb` to debug a Django application, there are a few things to keep in mind to ensure that the debugger behaves as expected:\n\n1. **Ensure the Code Path is Executed**: Make sure that the portion of the code where you set your breakpoint is actually being executed. If the request handling doesn't reach that line, the breakpoint won't be hit.\n\n2. **Correct File Path**: Double-check the file path and line number where you're setting the breakpoint. Ensure that the line number is correct and that there's executable code at that line.\n\n3. **Django's Development Server**: When you run the Django development server with `pdb`, it starts a new process for handling requests. This means that if you set a breakpoint before the server starts handling requests, it may not work as intended. You might want to start the server first and then attach `pdb` to the running process.\n\n    Instead of starting the server with `pdb`, you can insert a breakpoint directly in your code using `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`. This ensures that the breakpoint will be hit when the code execution reaches that line.\n\n4. **Use `pdb` within the Code**: To debug a specific view or piece of code, insert a breakpoint directly in the function where you want to pause:\n\n    ```python\n    def my_view(request):\n        import pdb; pdb.set_trace()\n        # Your code here\n    ```\n\n5. **Check for Code Changes**: If you've made changes to your code, ensure you've saved them before running the server and debugging.\n\n6. **Server Reloads**: If you make changes to your code and the server reloads, any breakpoints you set in a previous session might not carry over. You would need to set them again.\n\nBy inserting `pdb.set_trace()` directly into your code, you can make sure that the execution will pause at the desired point, allowing you to inspect variables and step through the code. This method is often more straightforward for debugging Django applications compared to using the command-line `pdb` tool to start the server."
