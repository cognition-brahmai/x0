        "content": "I am currently learning Django and I have some models with custom methods to get values formatted in a specific way. I've defined these methods as properties in the model. However, I'm finding it difficult to use the value of these custom methods in an 'order_by()' function. For instance, in my 'Author' model, I have a custom method '_get_full_name' that returns the full name of an author. I can order the authors by their 'first_name', but not by their 'full_name'. What would be the right approach to use 'order_by()' with a custom property like 'full_name'?\n\nHere is my current model for reference:\n\n```python\nclass Author(models.Model):\n    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)\n    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=40)\n    email = models.EmailField(blank=True, verbose_name='e-mail')\n\n    def _get_full_name(self):\n        return u'%s %s' % (self.first_name, self.last_name)\n    full_name = property(_get_full_name)\n\n    def __unicode__(self):\n        return self.full_name\n```\n\nAnd here is how I am currently trying to order the authors:\n\n```python\n>>> Author.objects.all()\n[<Author: John Doh>, <Author: Jane Doh>, <Author: Andre Miller>]\n>>> Author.objects.order_by('first_name')\n[<Author: Andre Miller>, <Author: Jane Doh>, <Author: John Doh>]\n```\n\nHowever, I am not able to order the authors by their 'full_name':\n\n```python\n>>> Author.objects.order_by('full_name')\nFieldError: Cannot resolve keyword 'full_name' into field. Choices are: book, email, first_name, id, last_name\n```"

        "content": "In Django, the `order_by()` function works directly with database fields and not with Python properties or methods. The `full_name` property in your `Author` model is computed at the Python level, and Django's ORM doesn't know about it when constructing SQL queries. To order by a calculated field like `full_name`, you have a few options:\n\n### Option 1: Annotate with Concat\n\nYou can use Django's `annotate()` and the `Concat` function from `django.db.models.functions` to create a queryable field that can be used with `order_by()`.\n\nHere's how you can modify your query:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db.models import Value\nfrom django.db.models.functions import Concat\n\nauthors = Author.objects.annotate(\n    full_name=Concat('first_name', Value(' '), 'last_name')\n).order_by('full_name')\n```\n\nThis approach creates a new annotated field called `full_name` that you can use to order the queryset.\n\n### Option 2: Database View\n\nFor more complex scenarios or if you need to use this kind of ordering frequently, consider creating a database view with the full name, and then map it to a model. This is more advanced and may be overkill for simple cases.\n\n### Option 3: Use Raw SQL\n\nAs a last resort, you can use raw SQL queries to achieve this, but it is generally not recommended unless necessary, as it can make your code less portable and harder to maintain.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\nIf you frequently need to order by first and last name combined, and performance is a concern, you might consider adding a `full_name` field directly to your model, updating it whenever `first_name` or `last_name` is changed, and using it for ordering. However, this denormalization approach should be carefully considered against your application's needs.\n\nUsing `annotate()` with `Concat` is typically the most straightforward and efficient solution for situations like this in Django."
