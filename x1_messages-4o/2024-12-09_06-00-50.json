However, I'm finding it quite difficult to achieve this seemingly simple task as a newcomer to NetworkX. I have found an example that shows how to add labels to the plot, but it seems overly complex for what I want to do, which is simply to display labels that are identical to the node name when drawing the graph. \n\nHere is the code I have so far:\n\n```python\n# Add nodes and edges\nG.add_node(\"Node1\")\nG.add_node(\"Node2\")\nG.add_edge(\"Node1\", \"Node2\")\nnx.draw(G)    # Doesn't draw labels. How to make it show labels Node1, Node2 along?\n```\n\nHowever, this does not display the labels \"Node1\" and \"Node2\" as I want. Is there a way to make `nx.draw(G)` show the default labels (Node1, Node2 in this case) inline in the graph?"

        "content": "To display node labels in a NetworkX graph, you can use the `nx.draw` function together with the `nx.draw_networkx_labels` function. The `nx.draw` function by itself does not automatically display node labels, but you can add them with `nx.draw_networkx_labels`. Here is how you can modify your code to display labels that are identical to the node names:\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Create a graph\nG = nx.Graph()\n\n# Add nodes and edges\nG.add_node(\"Node1\")\nG.add_node(\"Node2\")\nG.add_edge(\"Node1\", \"Node2\")\n\n# Draw the graph\npos = nx.spring_layout(G)  # Positions for all nodes\n\nnx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_size=500, node_color='lightblue')\n\n# Alternatively, if you want more control:\n# nx.draw_networkx_labels(G, pos)\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`nx.draw` function**: The parameter `with_labels=True` is used to display the node labels on the graph. By default, `with_labels=False`, which is why labels weren't appearing in your initial code.\n  \n- **`pos` variable**: The `spring_layout` function computes the positions for the nodes in a way that attempts to distribute them evenly, which is helpful for visualization. You can use other layouts like `circular_layout`, `random_layout`, etc., depending on your preference.\n\n- **`plt.show()`**: This is used to display the graph plot.\n\nBy setting `with_labels=True`, NetworkX will use the node names as labels, which should achieve what you are looking for."
