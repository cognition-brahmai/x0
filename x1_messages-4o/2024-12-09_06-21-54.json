Here is an example of what I am trying to do:\n\n```python\n{x[row.SITE_NAME] = row.LOOKUP_TABLE for row in cursor}\n```\nInstead of using the traditional way like so:\n\n```python\nx = {}\nfor row in cursor:\n   x[row.SITE_NAME] = row.LOOKUP_TABLE\n```\nWhen I try to use the dictionary comprehension, I get an error message on the equal sign telling me it's an invalid syntax. It seems like the equal sign is being taken as a conditional clause (==), not a declaration of a variable. Can I build a Python dictionary using this type of loop or am I misunderstanding something? If so, how should I structure it?"

        "content": "Yes, you can definitely build a Python dictionary using dictionary comprehension. The syntax for dictionary comprehension is slightly different from list comprehension and does not use an equal sign. Instead, it uses a colon (`:`) to separate the key and the value in the comprehension.\n\nHere's how you can convert your traditional loop into a dictionary comprehension:\n\n```python\nx = {row.SITE_NAME: row.LOOKUP_TABLE for row in cursor}\n```\n\nIn dictionary comprehension, the part before the `for` keyword specifies the key-value pair, where the key and value are separated by a colon. So in your case, `row.SITE_NAME` is the key and `row.LOOKUP_TABLE` is the value.\n\nMake sure that `cursor` is iterable in your context (like a list of objects or records), and each `row` has the attributes `SITE_NAME` and `LOOKUP_TABLE`. This should work without any syntax issues if everything is correctly defined."
