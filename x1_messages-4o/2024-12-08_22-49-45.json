One classic proof of \u03c0's irrationality is due to Johann Lambert in 1768. Lambert used continued fractions to show that if \\( x \\) is a non-zero rational number, then \\(\\tan(x)\\) is irrational. Since \\(\\tan(\\pi/4) = 1\\) is rational, it follows that \\(\\pi/4\\) and hence \\(\\pi\\) must be irrational.\n\nAnother modern proof involves assuming \\(\\pi\\) is rational, \\(\\pi = \\frac{p}{q}\\), and deriving a contradiction using series expansion and integrals.\n\n#### Real-World Examples\n\n1. **Measurement**: In any circle, the ratio of the circumference to the diameter is always \\(\\pi\\), which cannot be precisely calculated as a finite fraction.\n2. **Geometry and Trigonometry**: The appearance of \\(\\pi\\) in formulas for areas and volumes of shapes like circles and spheres illustrates its fundamental nature in geometry.\n\n### Properties of Rational vs. Irrational Numbers\n\n| Property                | Rational Numbers                      | Irrational Numbers                          |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Definition              | Can be expressed as a fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers and \\(b \\neq 0\\). | Cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers. |\n| Decimal Representation  | Either terminates or repeats.         | Neither terminates nor repeats.             |\n| Examples                | \\( \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{4}, 0.3333...\\) | \\(\\pi, \\sqrt{2}, e\\)                        |\n| Use in Computation      | Easily calculated and represented.    | Approximations are used for calculations.   |\n\n### Code Snippet to Calculate \u03c0\n\n```python\n# Using the Chudnovsky algorithm to compute \u03c0 to 100 decimal places\nfrom decimal import Decimal, getcontext\n\ndef compute_pi(n):\n    getcontext().prec = n + 2  # Set precision\n    C = 426880 * Decimal(10005).sqrt()\n    M = 1\n    L = 13591409\n    X = 1\n    K = 6\n    S = L\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        M = (K**3 - 16*K) * M // i**3\n        L += 545140134\n        X *= -262537412640768000\n        S += Decimal(M * L) / X\n        K += 12\n    pi = C / S\n    return str(pi)[:n]\n\n# Calculate \u03c0 to 100 decimal places\nprint(compute_pi(100))\n```\n\n### Historical Significance of \u03c0\n\n- **Ancient Civilizations**: \u03c0 has been known since ancient Egypt and Babylonia, where approximations like \\( \\frac{22}{7} \\) were used. Archimedes made one of the first theoretical calculations of \u03c0.\n- **Modern Applications**: \u03c0 is crucial in fields like computer graphics for rendering curves and circles, and in cryptography for algorithms that rely on complex mathematical computations.\n\n### Philosophical Implications\n\nThe irrationality of numbers like \u03c0 challenges our understanding of measurement and precision. It suggests that not all quantities can be neatly expressed in rational terms, reflecting a deeper complexity in the universe. This ties into the concept of infinity, as the decimal expansion of \u03c0 is infinite and non-repeating, prompting reflections on the nature of mathematical reality and abstraction.\n\nIn conclusion, \u03c0's irrationality is a fascinating topic that bridges mathematical theory, practical applications, and philosophical inquiry, illustrating the depth and breadth of mathematics as a discipline."
