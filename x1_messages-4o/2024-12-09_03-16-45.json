I am considering using a Geforce GPU with limited double precision and want to emulate double precision using two single precision floats, as Nvidia charges a significant premium for double precision enabled Tesla cards which only provide one third of the single precision performance (with exceptions like Titan/Titan Black)."

        "content": "Yes, it's possible to emulate double precision floating-point arithmetic using two single precision floating-point numbers on a GPU, but there are significant trade-offs involved.\n\n### Conceptual Overview:\n\n1. **Representation**: You can represent a double precision number using two single precision numbers. One approach is to use one single precision float for the high bits and another for the low bits. This is often referred to as \"double-single\" arithmetic.\n\n2. **Arithmetic Operations**: Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) need to be redefined to handle this representation. This involves breaking down operations into parts, handling carries, and ensuring that precision is maintained.\n\n3. **Library Support**: There are libraries available, like QD (Quad-Double) library, which can help implement these kinds of operations if you're not looking to implement them from scratch.\n\n### Performance Considerations:\n\n1. **Increased Computation**: Emulating double precision using two single precision numbers involves additional arithmetic operations and logic to manage carries and precision, leading to a significant performance overhead.\n\n2. **Memory Bandwidth**: You will need to manage twice the data compared to native double precision, which can lead to increased memory bandwidth usage.\n\n3. **Instruction Throughput**: The additional logic and operations reduce instruction throughput and increase the number of executed instructions, leading to slower performance compared to native single precision.\n\n4. **CUDA Cores Utilization**: While you can utilize the available CUDA cores for parallel computation, the overhead of emulating double precision may result in underutilization of the GPU's computational capabilities.\n\nIn summary, while emulating double precision with two single precision floats is feasible, it's generally much slower than using native double precision hardware. The exact performance hit depends on the specific operations and the GPU architecture, but in general, you can expect a significant reduction in throughput compared to native single precision operations. If you have a Geforce GPU that offers limited double precision, you might find that even this limited capability is faster than emulating double precision with single precision operations.\n\nFor computationally intensive applications where precision is critical, it may still be worthwhile to invest in hardware that supports efficient double precision arithmetic or explore software optimization techniques that can mitigate some of the performance losses."
