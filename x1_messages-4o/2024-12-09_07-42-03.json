I wish to use Flask, a webapp framework, and I have seen a method involving downloading, extracting and copying files from the Flask directory to the project directory. However, this doesn't seem like the most efficient approach. Are there better ways to manage third-party code, especially when I need to track versions, test upgrades or handle situations where two libraries share a subdirectory? I understand that Python can import modules from zipfiles and that pip can work with a REQUIREMENTS file. I'm also aware that pip has a zip command for use with GAE."

        "content": "Managing third-party Python libraries on Google App Engine (GAE) can indeed be streamlined using a few best practices. Given your requirements for efficiency, version tracking, and handling dependencies, here are some recommended approaches:\n\n1. **Virtual Environment**: \n   - Use a virtual environment to manage dependencies locally. This isolates your project dependencies from the global Python environment, making it easier to manage and track versions.\n   - You can create a virtual environment using:\n     ```bash\n     python3 -m venv myenv\n     source myenv/bin/activate\n     ```\n\n2. **Requirements File**:\n   - Maintain a `requirements.txt` file which lists all your dependencies. This file can be generated using:\n     ```bash\n     pip freeze > requirements.txt\n     ```\n   - You can then install all the dependencies listed in this file by running:\n     ```bash\n     pip install -r requirements.txt\n     ```\n\n3. **App Engine Standard Environment**:\n   - In the App Engine Standard Environment, you can specify the `requirements.txt` file in your `app.yaml` for automatic installation of dependencies:\n     ```yaml\n     runtime: python38\n     entrypoint: gunicorn -b :$PORT main:app\n\n     handlers:\n     - url: /.*\n       script: auto\n\n     libraries:\n     - name: flask\n       version: \"latest\"\n     ```\n\n4. **Vendoring**:\n   - If you need more control or if the library isn't available in the standard environment, you can vendor the libraries. This involves copying the libraries into your project directory.\n   - You can automate vendoring using a script or tools like `pip`:\n     ```bash\n     pip install -t lib/ -r requirements.txt\n     ```\n   - Then, you can add this directory to your `sys.path` in your `main.py` or `appengine_config.py`:\n     ```python\n     import sys\n     sys.path.insert(0, 'lib')\n     ```\n\n5. **Zip Import**:\n   - Python can import from zip files, which can be used to package dependencies. However, this approach is less common and can complicate debugging.\n   - You can create a zip file of your dependencies and add it to your `sys.path`.\n\n6. **Testing and Upgrades**:\n   - Use a combination of `requirements.txt` and virtual environments to test upgrades. Create a new virtual environment, adjust the `requirements.txt` with the new version, and test your application.\n   - Tools like `pipenv` or `poetry` can also be used for more advanced dependency management and version tracking.\n\nBy using these methods, you can efficiently manage your third-party Python libraries in Google App Engine while maintaining control over versions and dependencies."
