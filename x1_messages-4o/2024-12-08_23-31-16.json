        "content": "The DREAM Act, which stands for Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, is proposed legislation in the United States aimed at providing a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children. First introduced in 2001, the act has undergone various revisions over the years but generally includes requirements such as arriving in the U.S. as a minor, maintaining a certain level of residency, and meeting educational or military service criteria.\n\nThe primary goal of the DREAM Act is to offer these young immigrants, often referred to as \"Dreamers,\" the opportunity to contribute to society without the fear of deportation. It seeks to create a conditional residency status, which can eventually lead to permanent residency and citizenship if certain conditions are met. While the DREAM Act has not been passed into law, it has inspired related policies and discussions around immigration reform, including the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program."
