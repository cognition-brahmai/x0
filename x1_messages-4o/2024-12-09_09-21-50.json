        "content": "To merge two sorted lists into one sorted list in Python, you can use a simple algorithm that compares the elements of both lists and appends the smaller element to the result list. Here's a step-by-step guide and a sample code to achieve this:\n\n1. Initialize two pointers, one for each list (`i` for the first list and `j` for the second list).\n2. Initialize an empty list called `merged_list` to store the merged result.\n3. Use a while loop to iterate through both lists until one of the pointers reaches the end of its list.\n4. Compare the elements pointed to by `i` and `j`. Append the smaller element to `merged_list` and increment the corresponding pointer.\n5. After the loop, append any remaining elements from both lists to `merged_list`.\n6. Return or print the `merged_list`.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this logic:\n\n```python\ndef merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2):\n    merged_list = []\n    i, j = 0, 0\n\n    # Traverse both lists and add the smaller element to merged_list\n    while i < len(list1) and j < len(list2):\n        if list1[i] < list2[j]:\n            merged_list.append(list1[i])\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            merged_list.append(list2[j])\n            j += 1\n\n    # Append remaining elements, if any\n    while i < len(list1):\n        merged_list.append(list1[i])\n        i += 1\n\n    while j < len(list2):\n        merged_list.append(list2[j])\n        j += 1\n\n    return merged_list\n\n# Example usage:\nlist1 = [1, 3, 5, 7]\nlist2 = [2, 4, 6, 8]\nresult = merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2)\nprint(\"Merged List:\", result)\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n\n```\nMerged List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n```\n\nThis function efficiently merges two sorted lists into a single sorted list by taking advantage of the fact that both input lists are already sorted."
