        "content": "To modify your Scala code to search for text files in subdirectories as well as exclude image files from the search, you can use a recursive function to traverse through the directories. Additionally, you can refine your file filtering logic to exclude image files based on their extensions. Here\u2019s how you can modify your code:\n\n```scala\nimport java.io.File\n\ndef getAllTextFiles(dir: File): Seq[File] = {\n  val extensionsToExclude = Set(\".jpg\", \".jpeg\", \".png\", \".gif\", \".bmp\") // Add other image extensions as needed\n  val files = dir.listFiles\n  val textFiles = files.filter(file => file.isFile && file.getName.endsWith(\".txt\") && !extensionsToExclude.exists(file.getName.toLowerCase.endsWith))\n  val directories = files.filter(_.isDirectory)\n  textFiles ++ directories.flatMap(getAllTextFiles)\n}\n\nval directory = new File(\"/path/to/directory\")\nval textFiles = getAllTextFiles(directory)\n\nif (textFiles.nonEmpty) {\n  val totalCharacters = textFiles.map(_.getName.length).sum\n  val averageCharacters = totalCharacters.toDouble / textFiles.length\n  println(s\"The average number of characters in the names of all the text files is: $averageCharacters\")\n} else {\n  println(\"No text files found.\")\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Recursive Function (`getAllTextFiles`)**: This function takes a directory as input and recursively searches for all text files within that directory and its subdirectories. It filters out files with image extensions.\n\n2. **Exclusion Logic**: The `extensionsToExclude` set contains the image file extensions you want to exclude from your search. You can add more extensions to this set if needed.\n\n3. **File Filtering**: The logic checks if a file is not an image and is a text file (`.txt`) before including it in the result.\n\n4. **Handling Empty Results**: The code checks if any text files were found before calculating the average to avoid division by zero.\n\nThis approach ensures that the code not only searches through all subdirectories but also excludes files with specified image extensions."
