This started when I was experimenting with the 'pd.options.display.max_rows' parameter and set it to 1000. However, even after commenting out this line and restarting the kernel, one of my outputs still shows up inside a frame. How can I avoid this?"

        "content": "When Jupyter notebooks display output in scrollable frames, it usually indicates that the output is too large to be displayed all at once within the confines of the notebook cell. This behavior can be influenced by various settings and configurations. Here are a few steps you can take to prevent this from happening:\n\n1. **Check Jupyter Notebook Settings**:\n   - Jupyter has a built-in mechanism to limit the maximum height of outputs that can be displayed without scrolling. You can adjust this setting in your notebook's settings or configuration files.\n\n2. **Update Display Options**:\n   - Since you mentioned `pd.options.display.max_rows`, ensure that other similar configurations, such as `pd.options.display.max_columns`, are set to accommodate your data without overwhelming the output area.\n   - You can reset these options back to their defaults using:\n     ```python\n     pd.reset_option('display.max_rows')\n     pd.reset_option('display.max_columns')\n     ```\n\n3. **Use `display()` with styling**:\n   - You can control the output display by using Pandas styling options. For example, you can use:\n     ```python\n     from IPython.display import display\n     display(df.style.set_table_attributes(\"style='display:inline'\").set_table_styles([dict(selector='th', props=[('font-size', '12px')])]))\n     ```\n\n4. **Adjust Notebook's CSS**:\n   - You can inject custom CSS to adjust the height of the output cells. This can be done by adding a cell in your notebook with the following content:\n     ```html\n     <style>\n     .output_scroll {\n       height: auto !important;\n     }\n     </style>\n     ```\n   - This will override the default scrolling behavior.\n\n5. **Consider DataFrame Methods**:\n   - If the problem persists, consider using methods that limit output, such as `head()`, `tail()`, or `sample()`, to display a subset of your DataFrame.\n\n6. **Restart and Clear Output**:\n   - Sometimes, simply restarting the kernel and clearing all outputs can help reset any cached configurations that might be affecting the display.\n\n7. **Check Jupyter Extensions**:\n   - If you have any Jupyter extensions or themes installed, they might be overriding default behaviors. Check their settings or temporarily disable them to see if it resolves the issue.\n\nBy adjusting these settings and configurations, you should be able to control how your outputs are displayed in Jupyter Notebook and avoid scrollable frames for large outputs."
