However, I'm experiencing some issues when trying to represent a function that returns a generator. Here is the function I'm trying to annotate:\n\n```python\ndef myfunc(x: [int]) -> \"generator that returns ints\":\n    return (n for n in x if n%2 == 0)\n```\nHow should I annotate the return value? Is there any reference available to assist with this?"

        "content": "In Python 3.x, you can use the `typing` module to annotate a function that returns a generator. The `typing` module provides a special type called `Generator` that can be used for this purpose. The `Generator` type is parameterized with three types: the type of values yielded by the generator, the type of values sent to the generator, and the type of the value returned when the generator terminates.\n\nFor a generator that yields integers and does not expect any values to be sent to it or return anything specific, you can use `Generator[int, None, None]`.\n\nHere's how you can annotate your function:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Generator, List\n\ndef myfunc(x: List[int]) -> Generator[int, None, None]:\n    return (n for n in x if n % 2 == 0)\n```\n\nIn this annotation:\n\n- `List[int]` indicates that the parameter `x` is a list of integers.\n- `Generator[int, None, None]` indicates that the function returns a generator that yields integers, does not receive any values, and does not return any specific value upon completion.\n\nThis should resolve the issues you are experiencing with annotating a function that returns a generator. For more information, you can refer to the official Python documentation on [typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Generator)."
