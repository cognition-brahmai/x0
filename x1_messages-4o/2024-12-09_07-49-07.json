I've encountered an issue where my member variable strings are being treated as tuples, not strings. Here's the code I wrote:\n\n```python\nclass Car(object):\n    condition = \"new\"\n    def __init__(self, model, color, mpg):\n        self.model = model,\n        self.color = color,\n        self.mpg = mpg\n\nmy_car = Car(\"DeLorean\", \"silver\", 88)\nprint my_car.model\nprint my_car.color\nprint my_car.mpg\nprint my_car.condition\n```\n\nWhen I run this, I expect all member variables of the `my_car` object to be printed as strings, similar to `condition`. However, `model` and `color` are being treated as tuples. The output I'm getting is:\n\n```python\n('DeLorean',) #Tuple\n('silver',) #Tuple\n88 \nnew #String\nNone\n```\n\nThis is causing a validation failure because CodeAcademy expects \"silver\", but my code is returning `('silver',)`. Can someone help me understand where I went wrong in my code?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the trailing commas in the assignments of `self.model` and `self.color` within the `__init__` method. In Python, adding a comma after a variable assignment without enclosing it in parentheses creates a single-element tuple. That's why you're seeing tuples instead of strings for `model` and `color`.\n\nHere's the corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nclass Car(object):\n    condition = \"new\"\n    def __init__(self, model, color, mpg):\n        self.model = model  # Removed the comma here\n        self.color = color  # Removed the comma here\n        self.mpg = mpg\n\nmy_car = Car(\"DeLorean\", \"silver\", 88)\nprint(my_car.model)     # Now prints \"DeLorean\"\nprint(my_car.color)     # Now prints \"silver\"\nprint(my_car.mpg)       # Prints 88\nprint(my_car.condition) # Prints \"new\"\n```\n\nBy removing the commas, `self.model` and `self.color` are now assigned as strings rather than tuples. This should resolve the issue and produce the expected output."
