I'm having issues with the `requests` module, where it gives me a `ProxyError` when I set `proxies={\"https\":proxy}`. The error message is `(Caused by ProxyError('Cannot connect to proxy.', NewConnectionError('&lt;urllib3.connection.VerifiedHTTPSConnection object at 0x00000282DDD592B0&gt;: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10061] No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it',)))`. I've noticed that when I change `proxies={\"https\":proxy}` to `proxies={\"http\":proxy}`, it worked once but usually fails to connect. When I remove the `proxies={\"https\":proxy}` argument entirely, the scraping works without any errors. I suspect there's an issue with the proxy or the way I'm trying to access it."

        "content": "When dealing with proxies, especially when using services like Luminati, it's important to ensure that your setup is correct and that the proxy is configured properly for the type of requests you want to make. Here are some steps and tips that could help you troubleshoot and resolve the `ProxyError` you're encountering:\n\n1. **Verify Proxy Credentials and Settings:**\n   Ensure that you have the correct proxy address and that any required authentication (username, password) is correctly set. Luminati typically provides a proxy in the form `http://username:password@proxy_address:port`.\n\n2. **Use Correct Proxy Scheme:**\n   Since you're accessing an HTTPS site, you should use the `https` scheme in your proxy configuration. However, if your proxy only supports HTTP, you might need to change the approach. \n\n3. **Properly Set Up the `requests` Module:**\n   Here's how you can set up the `requests` module with a proxy, including authentication if necessary:\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n\n   proxy = \"http://username:password@proxy_address:port\"\n\n   proxies = {\n       \"http\": proxy,\n       \"https\": proxy,\n   }\n\n   try:\n       response = requests.get(\"https://example.com\", proxies=proxies)\n       print(response.status_code)\n       print(response.content)\n   except requests.exceptions.ProxyError as e:\n       print(f\"Proxy error: {e}\")\n   except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n       print(f\"Request error: {e}\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Check Network and Firewall Settings:**\n   Ensure that your network allows connections through the proxy port. Sometimes, firewalls or network configurations block proxy connections.\n\n5. **Test Proxy Independently:**\n   It might be helpful to test the proxy independently of your script using tools like `curl` or `Postman` to ensure that the proxy is functioning as expected.\n\n6. **Consult Luminati Documentation:**\n   Check Luminati's documentation or support for specific instructions on how to configure their proxies with Python's `requests` module. They might have specific requirements or configurations.\n\n7. **Debugging and Logging:**\n   Enable logging to get more detailed error messages. This can help pinpoint the issue:\n\n   ```python\n   import logging\n   import requests\n\n   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\n\n   proxy = \"http://username:password@proxy_address:port\"\n\n   proxies = {\n       \"http\": proxy,\n       \"https\": proxy,\n   }\n\n   try:\n       response = requests.get(\"https://example.com\", proxies=proxies)\n       print(response.status_code)\n       print(response.content)\n   except requests.exceptions.ProxyError as e:\n       print(f\"Proxy error: {e}\")\n   except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n       print(f\"Request error: {e}\")\n   ```\n\n8. **Contact Luminati Support:**\n   If none of the above solutions work, consider reaching out to Luminati's support team for assistance. They might be able to provide insights specific to their proxy service.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to troubleshoot and fix the `ProxyError` issue with your HTTPS requests using a proxy server."
