The brightness of its light beam cutting through the night is akin to the concept of luminosity.\n\nIn this analogy, the lighthouse represents a star, and the light beam is the luminosity. Just as the strength and reach of the lighthouse's beam help ships navigate by providing a clear point of reference, a star's luminosity is a measure of the total amount of light it emits, illuminating the cosmos around it.\n\nThe more luminous the lighthouse (or star), the further and more effectively its light can be perceived, regardless of the darkness surrounding it."
