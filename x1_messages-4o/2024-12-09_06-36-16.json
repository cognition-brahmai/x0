        "content": "The message \"During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred\" typically indicates that an exception was raised while handling another exception. In your case, this is due to the fact that `json.decoder.JSONDecodeError` is a subclass of `ValueError`, and the `JSONDecodeError` is being caught by your `except ValueError as e` block.\n\nThe message you're seeing is part of the traceback that Python provides to help you understand the sequence of events leading to the error. When you raise a new `Exception` within the `except` block, Python generates a new traceback, and it includes the information that another exception was already being handled when the new one was raised.\n\nTo resolve this issue and have clearer error handling, you can do the following:\n\n1. If you just want to provide a custom message while keeping the original traceback information, you can use the `raise ... from ...` syntax, which explicitly links the two exceptions:\n\n    ```python\n    import json\n\n    with open(json_file) as j:\n        try:\n            json_config = json.load(j)\n        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n            raise Exception('Invalid json: {}'.format(e)) from e\n    ```\n\n2. Alternatively, if you want to suppress the original traceback and only see your custom message, you can use:\n\n    ```python\n    import json\n\n    with open(json_file) as j:\n        try:\n            json_config = json.load(j)\n        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n            raise Exception('Invalid json: {}'.format(e))\n    ```\n\nBoth solutions will allow you to properly handle the `JSONDecodeError` while providing clearer feedback about what went wrong. The first option provides more context by linking the two exceptions, which can be helpful for debugging."
