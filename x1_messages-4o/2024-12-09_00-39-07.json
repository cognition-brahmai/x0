In my first example, I multiplied values of variables in a namespace, and it worked as expected. However, when I tried to modify the code to append values to lists in a namespace, the lists did not change. Why did the lists not update as I expected?\n\nHere is the first example:\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\n\ndef f(ns):\n    ns.x *=10\n    ns.y *= 10\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    manager = multiprocessing.Manager()\n    ns = manager.Namespace()\n    ns.x = 1\n    ns.y = 2\n\n    print 'before', ns\n    p = multiprocessing.Process(target=f, args=(ns,))\n    p.start()\n    p.join()\n    print 'after', ns\n```\nThe output is:\n```python\nbefore Namespace(x=1, y=2)\nafter Namespace(x=10, y=20)\n```\nThen, I modified the code like this:\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\n\ndef f(ns):\n    ns.x.append(10)\n    ns.y.append(10)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    manager = multiprocessing.Manager()\n    ns = manager.Namespace()\n    ns.x = []\n    ns.y = []\n\n    print 'before', ns\n    p = multiprocessing.Process(target=f, args=(ns,))\n    p.start()\n    p.join()\n    print 'after', ns\n```\nBut the output is:\n```python\nbefore Namespace(x=[], y=[])\nafter Namespace(x=[], y=[])\n```\nCan anyone explain why the lists in the second example are not being updated?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to how `multiprocessing.Manager()` handles mutable objects like lists. When you use a `Namespace` with a `Manager`, the attributes are intended to be simple objects like integers or strings that can be transferred between processes. However, when you use mutable objects like lists, the changes made to them in a subprocess may not reflect in the main process as expected.\n\nIn your first example, you are working with integers, which are immutable. The entire value is being updated in the subprocess and then correctly reflected in the main process. However, in the second example, you're trying to modify a mutable object (a list) in place. This in-place modification doesn't propagate back to the main process because the `Namespace` does not manage the synchronization of mutable objects like lists.\n\nTo achieve the desired behavior, you should use a `Manager` to create the list itself, which provides a proxy object that ensures changes in the subprocess are reflected in the main process. Here's how you can modify your second example to work correctly:\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\n\ndef f(ns):\n    ns.x.append(10)\n    ns.y.append(10)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    manager = multiprocessing.Manager()\n    ns = manager.Namespace()\n    ns.x = manager.list()  # Use manager.list() to create a proxy list\n    ns.y = manager.list()\n\n    print('before', ns)\n    p = multiprocessing.Process(target=f, args=(ns,))\n    p.start()\n    p.join()\n    print('after', ns)\n```\n\nBy using `manager.list()`, you create a proxy object for the list that is managed by the `Manager`, allowing for inter-process communication and ensuring that changes made to the list in one process are visible in another."
