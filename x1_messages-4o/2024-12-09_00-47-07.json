        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to the MongoDB server invalidating the cursor. This often happens if the cursor is not iterated through in a timely manner or if the server times out the cursor due to inactivity. By default, MongoDB will close a cursor after 10 minutes of inactivity.\n\nHere are a few strategies to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Batch Processing:**\n   - Instead of fetching all documents in one go, process them in smaller batches. You can use the `batch_size` parameter in the `find()` method to control how many documents are returned in each batch.\n\n   ```python\n   cursor = coll.find().batch_size(1000)  # Adjust the batch size as needed\n   for doc in cursor:\n       # Process each document\n   ```\n\n2. **Increase Timeout:**\n   - If processing each document takes a significant amount of time, you might want to increase the server-side timeout for cursors. You can do this by setting a higher `maxTimeMS` option, though this approach is generally not recommended for large-scale solutions due to potential server load.\n\n3. **Use `noCursorTimeout`:**\n   - When you create a cursor with `find()`, you can use the `no_cursor_timeout` option to prevent the server from timing out the cursor.\n\n   ```python\n   cursor = coll.find(no_cursor_timeout=True)\n   try:\n       for doc in cursor:\n           # Process each document\n   finally:\n       cursor.close()  # Ensure the cursor is closed after use\n   ```\n\n4. **Consider Using a Paged Approach:**\n   - Use the `_id` field (or another indexed field) to manually paginate through your data. This approach allows you to handle large datasets more efficiently and avoid cursor timeouts.\n\n   ```python\n   page_size = 1000\n   last_id = None\n\n   while True:\n       query = {} if last_id is None else {'_id': {'$gt': last_id}}\n       batch = list(coll.find(query).sort('_id', pymongo.ASCENDING).limit(page_size))\n       if not batch:\n           break\n       for doc in batch:\n           # Process each document\n           last_id = doc['_id']\n   ```\n\n5. **Ensure Efficient Querying:**\n   - Ensure that your queries are efficient and make use of indexes. This will speed up data retrieval and reduce the likelihood of timeouts.\n\nBy applying these strategies, you should be able to handle large datasets in MongoDB more effectively without encountering cursor timeout errors."
