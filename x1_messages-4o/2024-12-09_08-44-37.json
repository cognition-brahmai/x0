        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to how the `pickle` module handles the serialization and deserialization of exception objects. By default, `pickle` uses the `__reduce__` method to serialize the state of an object. However, when dealing with exceptions, especially custom ones, `pickle` attempts to call the exception's `__init__` method upon deserialization, but it only provides the arguments that were used in the base `Exception` class, which usually expects just one argument (the message).\n\nTo make your custom exception class pickle-friendly, you need to override the `__reduce__` method to ensure that both arguments are appropriately serialized and that the object can be reconstructed with the same state.\n\nHere's how you can modify your class:\n\n```python\nimport pickle\n\nclass MyException(Exception):\n    def __init__(self, arg1, arg2):\n        self.arg1 = arg1\n        self.arg2 = arg2\n        super(MyException, self).__init__(arg1)\n\n    def __reduce__(self):\n        # Return a tuple containing the class, a tuple of arguments for __init__, and optionally state\n        return (self.__class__, (self.arg1, self.arg2))\n\ne = MyException(\"foo\", \"bar\")\n\n# Serialize the exception\nserialized = pickle.dumps(e)\n# Deserialize the exception\nobj = pickle.loads(serialized)\n\nprint(f\"arg1: {obj.arg1}, arg2: {obj.arg2}\")\n```\n\nIn the `__reduce__` method, we specify a tuple with the class itself and a tuple of arguments that should be passed to the `__init__` method during unpickling. This ensures that the exception object can be correctly reconstructed with all its attributes intact. \n\nThis approach makes sure that the `pickle` module knows how to serialize and deserialize your custom exception class, preserving all necessary data across the process."
