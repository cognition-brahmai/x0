The text I am looking for is \"text I am looking for\", which is present inside a `<strong>` tag, which itself is nested inside a `<td>` tag with `class=\"pos\"`. The current code I am using is `result = soup.find('td', {'class' :'pos'}).find('strong').text` but it returns the first found value. I need to filter it by \"Fixed text:\" somehow. Also, when I try the following code: `title = soup.find('td', text = re.compile(ur'Fixed text:(.*)', re.DOTALL), attrs = {'class': 'pos'})`, it returns just \"Fixed text:\", not the `<strong>`-highlighted text in that same element. How can I find this specific text?"

        "content": "To find a specific text within a nested structure using Beautiful Soup, you need to carefully navigate the HTML and apply the right filters. In your case, you want to find a `<strong>` tag containing the text nested within a `<td>` tag with the class `pos`. You also want to ensure that the text is associated with a specific \"Fixed text:\" pattern.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Find all the relevant `<td>` tags with the class `pos`.**\n2. **Filter these `<td>` tags to find the one that contains the \"Fixed text:\" pattern.**\n3. **Extract the text from the `<strong>` tag within the matching `<td>` tag.**\n\nHere's a sample implementation in Python using Beautiful Soup:\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport re\n\n# Sample HTML content\nhtml_content = \"\"\"\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <td class=\"pos\">Fixed text: <strong>text I am looking for</strong></td>\n        <td class=\"pos\">Fixed text: <strong>another text</strong></td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\"\"\"\n\n# Parse the HTML content\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')\n\n# Find all the <td> tags with class 'pos'\ntd_tags = soup.find_all('td', class_='pos')\n\n# Iterate over each <td> and find the one containing the \"Fixed text:\" pattern\nfor td in td_tags:\n    # Check if the \"Fixed text:\" is present in the text of the <td>\n    if \"Fixed text:\" in td.text:\n        # Extract the text from the <strong> tag within this <td>\n        strong_tag = td.find('strong')\n        if strong_tag:\n            found_text = strong_tag.text\n            print(\"Found text:\", found_text)\n            break  # Exit the loop if you found the desired text\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`soup.find_all('td', class_='pos')`:** This finds all `<td>` elements with the specified class.\n- **`if \"Fixed text:\" in td.text:`**: This checks if the \"Fixed text:\" pattern is present in the text of the current `<td>`.\n- **`td.find('strong')`:** This retrieves the `<strong>` tag within the `<td>`.\n- **`strong_tag.text`:** This extracts the text from the `<strong>` tag.\n\nThis code will correctly identify the `<strong>` text associated with the specific \"Fixed text:\" pattern you're interested in. Adjust the `html_content` variable to match the structure of your actual HTML data if needed."
