For example, given a 2D array as follows:\n\n```python\na = np.array([[0, 1],\n              [2, 3],\n              [4, 5],\n              [6, 7],\n              [9, 8]])\n```\nAfter applying the function, the output should be:\n\n```python\nb = [[0. 1.]\n     [0. 1.]\n     [0. 1.]\n     [0. 1.]\n     [1. 0.]]\n```\n\nI tried implementing a function that uses numpy's `argmax` to find the index of the maximum value in each row and then sets that index to 1 in a zero-filled array with the same shape, but it's not working as expected:\n\n```python\ndef some_function(x):\n    a = np.zeros(x.shape)\n    a[:,np.argmax(x, axis=1)] = 1\n    return a\n\nb = some_function(a)\nprint(b)\n```\n\nHowever, this code is giving me an output of all ones, not as expected:\n\n```python\n[[1. 1.]\n [1. 1.]\n [1. 1.]\n [1. 1.]\n [1. 1.]]\n```"

        "content": "The issue with your implementation is that you are using `np.argmax(x, axis=1)` and trying to directly assign the value 1 to all rows at once. Instead, you need to iterate over each row to correctly place the 1s at the position of the maximum value for each row.\n\nHere's a corrected version of the function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef some_function(x):\n    a = np.zeros_like(x, dtype=float)  # Create a zero-filled array of the same shape\n    max_indices = np.argmax(x, axis=1)  # Find the indices of the max values along axis 1\n    for i, index in enumerate(max_indices):\n        a[i, index] = 1  # Set the max index in each row to 1\n    return a\n\n# Example usage\na = np.array([[0, 1],\n              [2, 3],\n              [4, 5],\n              [6, 7],\n              [9, 8]])\n\nb = some_function(a)\nprint(b)\n```\n\nThis will output the desired result:\n\n```\n[[0. 1.]\n [0. 1.]\n [0. 1.]\n [0. 1.]\n [1. 0.]]\n```\n\nThis code works by iterating over each row with `enumerate()` and setting the index of the maximum value to 1 in the zero-filled array `a`. This way, you correctly identify and replace the maximum value in each row."
