Even though I installed it using `pip install virtualenv`, when I try to create a new virtual environment using `virtualenv venv`, I receive an error stating \"virtualenv : command not found\". I've verified that the installation location is \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages\" using `pip show virtualenv`, but I can't seem to locate the executable. I've tried several solutions from similar posts but none of them have worked for me. Can anyone help me figure out what's going wrong?"

        "content": "It sounds like the issue might be related to your system's PATH configuration. Here are a few steps you can follow to resolve this problem:\n\n1. **Verify Installation Path:**\n   Since you've installed `virtualenv` and its location is `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages`, make sure that Python's scripts directory is included in your PATH.\n\n2. **Check Python Version:**\n   Ensure that you're using the correct version of Python. Sometimes, the default Python on macOS is Python 2.x, but you might want to use Python 3.x. You can check your Python version by running:\n   ```sh\n   python --version\n   ```\n   or for Python 3:\n   ```sh\n   python3 --version\n   ```\n\n3. **Locate the Virtualenv Executable:**\n   Try to find the `virtualenv` executable by running:\n   ```sh\n   which virtualenv\n   ```\n   If this returns nothing, it means the executable is not in your PATH.\n\n4. **Add Python's Scripts Directory to PATH:**\n   Find out where `pip` installs scripts by running:\n   ```sh\n   python -m site --user-base\n   ```\n   This will give you a path like `/Users/your-username/Library/Python/2.7` or `/Users/your-username/Library/Python/3.x` depending on your Python version. Add the `bin` directory from this path to your PATH. For example:\n   ```sh\n   export PATH=\"$PATH:/Users/your-username/Library/Python/2.7/bin\"\n   ```\n\n5. **Use Python 3 and `venv` Module:**\n   If you are using Python 3, you may want to use the built-in `venv` module instead of `virtualenv`. You can create a virtual environment with:\n   ```sh\n   python3 -m venv venv\n   ```\n\n6. **Reinstall Virtualenv:**\n   If none of the above steps work, try reinstalling `virtualenv`:\n   ```sh\n   pip uninstall virtualenv\n   pip install virtualenv\n   ```\n   Ensure you're using the correct version of pip that matches your desired Python version (use `pip3` for Python 3).\n\n7. **Restart Terminal:**\n   After making changes to your PATH or installing packages, restart your terminal for changes to take effect.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with `virtualenv` on your MacBook. Let me know if you need further assistance!"
