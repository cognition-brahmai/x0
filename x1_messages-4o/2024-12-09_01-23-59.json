According to \"Building Skills in Python\", a file name like `exercise_1.py` is more desirable than `exercise-1.py`. While both programs can be run from the command line, the file name with the hyphen supposedly limits our ability to write larger and more sophisticated programs. Can you explain why this is the case?"

        "content": "In Python and many other programming environments, underscores are generally preferred over hyphens in file names for several reasons:\n\n1. **Syntax Compatibility**: In Python, the hyphen character (`-`) is interpreted as a minus operator. If you were to import a module with a hyphen in its file name, it would cause a syntax error because Python would try to interpret it as a subtraction operation. For example, `import exercise-1` would be invalid. On the other hand, underscores (`_`) are valid characters in identifiers and do not conflict with Python's syntax, making `import exercise_1` perfectly valid.\n\n2. **Naming Conventions**: Underscores are widely used in Python naming conventions for variables, functions, and files. They enhance readability by acting as a separator in place of spaces, which are not allowed in identifiers.\n\n3. **Portability**: Some operating systems and file systems have restrictions or different conventions regarding the use of special characters in file names. While most modern systems handle hyphens without issues, using underscores ensures maximum compatibility and avoids potential problems when moving files between different environments.\n\n4. **Command Line Usability**: When using command-line interfaces, hyphens are often used to denote command options or flags. This can create confusion or require additional handling (like escaping) when dealing with file names that include hyphens.\n\n5. **Code Readability**: Underscores provide a clear separation without the ambiguity that hyphens might introduce, especially when file names are read or processed programmatically.\n\nFor these reasons, using underscores in file names is a best practice in Python programming, as it ensures compatibility, readability, and ease of use across different platforms and coding scenarios."
