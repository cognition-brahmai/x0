I also get a series of \"Unknown distribution option\" errors, specifically for entry_points, zip_safe, test_suite, and tests_require. This happens even when I try to upgrade pip. I'm using pip 1.0.1 and ActivePython 2.7. I tried using ActiveState's pypm, but it lacks the packages I need. Can anyone tell me where pip is downloading packages to, and why it's failing in this way? Here is the error output I receive when I try to install requests-oauth:\n\n```\nC:\\test&gt;pip install requests-oauth\nDownloading/unpacking requests-oauth\n  Downloading requests-oauth-0.4.1.tar.gz\n  Running setup.py egg_info for package requests-oauth\n    E:\\Plang\\ActivePython\\lib\\distutils\\dist.py:267: UserWarning: Unknown distribution option: 'zip_safe'\n      warnings.warn(msg)\n    E:\\Plang\\ActivePython\\lib\\distutils\\dist.py:267: UserWarning: Unknown distribution option: 'install_requires'\n      warnings.warn(msg)\n    usage: -c [global_opts] cmd1 [cmd1_opts] [cmd2 [cmd2_opts] ...]\n       or: -c --help [cmd1 cmd2 ...]\n       or: -c --help-commands\n       or: -c cmd --help\n\n    error: invalid command 'egg_info'\n    Complete output from command python setup.py egg_info:\n    E:\\Plang\\ActivePython\\lib\\distutils\\dist.py:267: UserWarning: Unknown distribution option: 'zip_safe'\n  warnings.warn(msg)\n\nE:\\Plang\\ActivePython\\lib\\distutils\\dist.py:267: UserWarning: Unknown distribution option: 'install_requires'\n  warnings.warn(msg)\n\nusage: -c [global_opts] cmd1 [cmd1_opts] [cmd2 [cmd2_opts] ...]\n   or: -c --help [cmd1 cmd2 ...]\n   or: -c --help-commands\n   or: -c cmd --help\n\nerror: invalid command 'egg_info'\n```"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the version of `pip` you're using is quite old, and it doesn't support some newer features used by many Python packages. Specifically, the `egg_info` command is part of the `setuptools` package, which is required for handling modern Python package installations.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Upgrade `pip` and `setuptools`:** Since you're using a very old version of `pip` (1.0.1), upgrading to the latest version will likely resolve the issue. You can do this by running the following commands:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n   python -m pip install --upgrade setuptools\n   ```\n\n   If you're still having issues with the upgrade, you might want to manually download the latest `get-pip.py` script from [https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) and run:\n\n   ```bash\n   python get-pip.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Python Path:** Ensure that you're using the correct Python version. Sometimes, multiple Python installations can cause confusion. Verify your current active Python version with:\n\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify Installation Directories:** You can check where `pip` is downloading the packages by looking at your Python's site-packages directory. You can find this directory by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m site\n   ```\n\n   This will show you the directories where Python is looking for packages.\n\n4. **Consider Using Virtual Environments:** If you're not already using virtual environments, consider setting one up to manage dependencies more cleanly. You can create a virtual environment by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv myenv\n   ```\n\n   Then activate it:\n\n   - On Windows:\n\n     ```bash\n     myenv\\Scripts\\activate\n     ```\n\n   - On macOS/Linux:\n\n     ```bash\n     source myenv/bin/activate\n     ```\n\n   Once activated, you can try installing the package again within this isolated environment.\n\n5. **Alternative Solutions:** If upgrading `pip` and `setuptools` does not resolve the issue, you might consider using a different Python distribution, such as the standard Python.org version, where you have more control over package management.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the errors you're encountering and install the required packages successfully."
