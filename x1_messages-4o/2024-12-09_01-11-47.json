I am currently unsure of how to measure the accuracy of this trained classifier. Does Scikit-learn offer any built-in function that can help me check the accuracy of my knn classifier? Here is the code I've used for classification:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nknn = KNeighborsClassifier()\nknn.fit(training, train_label)    \npredicted = knn.predict(testing)\n```\nCould you please guide me on how to proceed?"

        "content": "Certainly! To evaluate the accuracy of your k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier using Scikit-learn, you can use the `accuracy_score` function from the `sklearn.metrics` module. This function compares your predicted labels with the true labels from the test dataset and calculates the proportion of correctly classified instances.\n\nHere's how you can use it in your code:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n\n# Assuming 'testing_label' contains the true labels for the test data\naccuracy = accuracy_score(testing_label, predicted)\n\nprint(f\"Accuracy of the KNN classifier: {accuracy:.2f}\")\n```\n\nIn this snippet:\n\n1. `testing_label` should be the actual labels for your test dataset.\n2. `predicted` is the array of labels that your `knn` classifier predicted for the test data.\n3. `accuracy_score` computes the fraction of correctly classified instances.\n\nThis will give you the accuracy of your k-NN classifier as a decimal value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates perfect accuracy."
