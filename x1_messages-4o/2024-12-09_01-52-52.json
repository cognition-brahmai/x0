This function allows you to slice an iterator, which is perfect for generators. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import islice\n\ndef word_reader(file):\n    for line in open(file):\n        for p in line.split():\n            yield p\n\nreader = word_reader('txtfile')\n\n# Get the next 'n' values from the generator and store them in a list\nn = 5  # For example, let's say you want the next 5 words\nnext_n_values = list(islice(reader, n))\n\nprint(next_n_values)\n```\n\nIn this example, `islice(reader, n)` will take the next `n` items from the generator `reader`, and `list()` will convert them into a list. Make sure to replace `n` with the number of words you want to retrieve."
