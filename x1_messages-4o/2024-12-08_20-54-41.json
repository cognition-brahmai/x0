        "content": "Certainly! Let's consider an example of a conditional statement in C++ that includes a nested `if` statement within a `for` loop. This example will help illustrate the syntax and functionality of nested conditionals within a loop structure.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    // An array of integers\n    int numbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};\n    int size = sizeof(numbers) / sizeof(numbers[0]); // Calculate the size of the array\n\n    // Loop through each element in the array using a for loop\n    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {\n        // Check if the current element is even\n        if (numbers[i] % 2 == 0) {\n            cout << \"Number \" << numbers[i] << \" is even.\" << endl;\n            \n            // Nested if statement to check if the even number is greater than 5\n            if (numbers[i] > 5) {\n                cout << \"It is also greater than 5.\" << endl;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Array Initialization**: We start by initializing an array `numbers` that contains integers from 1 to 10.\n\n2. **Calculate Array Size**: The size of the array is calculated using `sizeof(numbers) / sizeof(numbers[0])`. This gives us the number of elements in the array.\n\n3. **For Loop**: The loop is structured using a `for` loop, which iterates over each element in the array.\n   - `int i = 0`: Initializes the loop counter `i` to start from the first element.\n   - `i < size`: Continues the loop as long as `i` is less than the size of the array.\n   - `++i`: Increments the loop counter after each iteration.\n\n4. **Outer If Statement**: Inside the loop, an `if` statement checks if the current element `numbers[i]` is even by evaluating `numbers[i] % 2 == 0`.\n   - If the condition is `true`, it prints that the number is even.\n\n5. **Nested If Statement**: Within the outer `if` block, there is another `if` statement (nested) that checks if the even number is greater than 5.\n   - If this condition is `true`, it prints an additional message stating that the number is greater than 5.\n\n### Interaction of Nested If with Loop:\n\n- The loop iterates over each element of the array. For each iteration, it evaluates the outer `if` condition.\n- If the outer condition is satisfied (i.e., the number is even), it enters the outer `if` block and evaluates the nested `if` condition.\n- This nested structure allows us to apply multiple layers of conditions within the same loop iteration, providing greater control and specificity over the logic applied to each element.\n\nThis example effectively demonstrates how nested `if` statements can be used within a loop to perform more complex conditional logic in C++."
