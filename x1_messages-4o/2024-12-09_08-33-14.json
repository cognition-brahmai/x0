        "content": "Yes, you can split a string of length \\(4 \\times x\\) into four separate strings, each of \\(x\\) characters long, without knowing the length of the string beforehand. This can be achieved using Python by dividing the string into equal parts based on its length. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef split_string_into_four_parts(s):\n    n = len(s) // 4  # Calculate the length of each part\n    if len(s) % 4 != 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"The length of the string is not a multiple of 4.\")\n    \n    # Split the string into four equal parts\n    part_one = s[0:n]\n    part_two = s[n:2*n]\n    part_three = s[2*n:3*n]\n    part_four = s[3*n:4*n]\n    \n    return part_one, part_two, part_three, part_four\n\n# Example usage\nx = \"qwertyui\"\none, two, three, four = split_string_into_four_parts(x)\nprint(\"Part one:\", one)\nprint(\"Part two:\", two)  # This will output 'er'\nprint(\"Part three:\", three)\nprint(\"Part four:\", four)\n```\n\nIn this code, the `split_string_into_four_parts` function takes a string `s` as input, calculates the length of each part by dividing the total length by 4, and then slices the string into four parts accordingly. It also checks if the string length is a multiple of 4 to ensure even splitting."
