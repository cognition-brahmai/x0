So, \\(\\text{ceil}(3.7) = 4\\).\n\n2. **Floor of 4.3**: The floor function rounds a number down to the nearest integer. So, \\(\\text{floor}(4.3) = 4\\).\n\n3. **Round of 2.5**: The round function rounds a number to the nearest integer. Since 2.5 is exactly halfway between 2 and 3, it rounds to the nearest even integer, which is 2.\n\nNow substitute these values back into the expression:\n\n\\[\n4 + \\frac{4}{2} = 4 + 2 = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, the result of the expression is \\(6\\)."
