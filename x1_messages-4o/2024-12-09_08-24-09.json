        "content": "I am working on a large Python 3.7+ project that I am planning to split into multiple packages that can be installed separately. Is it better to maintain all these packages in a single Git repository with each package having its own setup.py or should I have one repository per package? What are the implications of having multiple packages on the same GitHub repo? Will I face any issues with such a setup? Can common Python tools such as documentation generators, PyPI packaging, etc., work with this setup? I would like to understand if there are any technical issues or problems with either of these approaches. I am also aware that setuptools now allow installing dependencies from GitHub repos even if the GitHub URL of the setup.py is not at the root of the repository. Is this correct?"

        "content": "Splitting a large Python project into multiple packages can be approached in two primary ways: maintaining all packages in a single repository (a monorepo) or having one repository per package (multiple repos). Each approach has its pros and cons, and the best choice depends on your specific needs and workflow. Let's explore the implications of each approach:\n\n### Single Repository (Monorepo)\n**Pros:**\n1. **Centralized Management:** All packages are in one place, making it easier to manage issues, pull requests, and project-wide changes.\n2. **Consistent Versioning:** You can manage versions consistently across packages.\n3. **Simplified CI/CD:** Setting up continuous integration and deployment is easier since everything is in one place.\n4. **Shared Resources:** Easier to share common utilities, documentation, and configurations.\n\n**Cons:**\n1. **Complexity in Setup:** You need to set up the repository structure to handle multiple packages, often using tools like `setuptools` and `tox`.\n2. **Build Overhead:** Changes in one package might trigger builds for others unnecessarily unless finely tuned.\n3. **Access Control:** Harder to give access to specific packages if needed.\n\n**Implications and Tools:**\n- You can use a tool like `setuptools` with a custom setup to handle multiple packages. Create a directory for each package with its own `setup.py`.\n- For documentation, tools like Sphinx can be configured to generate documentation for multiple packages within the same repo.\n- PyPI packaging can be managed by specifying the directory of each package in your CI/CD pipeline.\n- Yes, `setuptools` can install dependencies from specific directories within a GitHub repo.\n\n### Multiple Repositories\n**Pros:**\n1. **Isolation:** Each package is independent, making it easier to manage permissions and lifecycle separately.\n2. **Focused Development:** Teams can focus on individual packages without worrying about unrelated code.\n3. **Independent Version Control:** Allows packages to have their own release cycles and versioning.\n\n**Cons:**\n1. **Coordination Overhead:** More effort is needed to coordinate changes across packages, especially if they are interdependent.\n2. **Complex CI/CD:** Setting up CI/CD for multiple repos can be more complex and requires more initial setup.\n3. **Dependency Management:** Managing shared dependencies can become cumbersome.\n\n**Implications and Tools:**\n- Each package has its own repository, with its own `setup.py`, making it straightforward to publish to PyPI.\n- Documentation and other tools need to be run separately for each repo.\n- You can use Git submodules or Git subtrees if you need to manage shared components.\n\n### Conclusion\nYour choice between a monorepo and multiple repos should be guided by the size of your team, the independence of the packages, and your workflow preferences. If the packages are tightly coupled and managed by a single team, a monorepo might be more advantageous. On the other hand, if they are independent or managed by different teams, multiple repositories could be better.\n\nRegarding `setuptools` and GitHub URLs: Yes, `setuptools` allows you to specify dependencies directly from a GitHub repository, even if the `setup.py` is not at the root. You can use a URL in your `requirements.txt` or `setup.py` to point to a specific directory in a GitHub repo.\n\nUltimately, consider the trade-offs and choose the structure that best aligns with your development practices and team setup."
