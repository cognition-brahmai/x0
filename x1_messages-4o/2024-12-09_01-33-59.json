The source of the data returns all available data at a given time, including new data that isn't already in the database. I need to loop through the source data and update the database accordingly, but I want to avoid making thousands of individual writes. Is there a way to use `update_or_create` in batches? I was considering using `update_or_create` with manual transactions, but I'm unsure if this would queue the individual writes or combine them into a single SQL insert. Could using the `@commit_on_success()` decorator on a function with `update_or_create` inside the loop work? I am only translating and saving the data to a model, and nothing depends on the model existing during the loop."

        "content": "When working with Django and needing to update or insert large amounts of data efficiently, it's important to minimize the number of database writes. The `update_or_create` method is convenient for individual records but not optimal for bulk operations due to its nature of running separate queries for each item.\n\nHere are some strategies you can employ to handle batch updates/inserts more efficiently:\n\n1. **Bulk Create with Conflict Handling**:\n   - If you're using PostgreSQL, you can utilize the `ON CONFLICT` clause with a raw SQL query or use Django's `bulk_create` with the `update_conflicts` feature (available in Django 4.0+). This allows you to insert multiple records at once and update existing ones based on a unique constraint.\n   - Example:\n     ```python\n     from django.db import transaction\n     from django.db.models import F\n\n     with transaction.atomic():\n         MyModel.objects.bulk_create(\n             [MyModel(field1=value1, field2=value2, ...) for value1, value2 in source_data],\n             update_conflicts=True,\n             unique_fields=['unique_field'],  # field to check for conflicts\n             update_fields=['field2', 'field3'],  # fields to update if conflict occurs\n         )\n     ```\n\n2. **Manual Bulk Operations**:\n   - Alternatively, you can read the existing data first, determine the differences, and then perform bulk operations:\n     1. Fetch existing records: Get the current records from the database.\n     2. Compare and contrast: Determine which records need to be updated and which need to be inserted.\n     3. Use `bulk_create` for new records and `bulk_update` for existing ones:\n       ```python\n       from django.db import transaction\n\n       existing_records = MyModel.objects.in_bulk(field_values, field_name='unique_field')\n\n       new_objects = []\n       updated_objects = []\n\n       for data in source_data:\n           unique_value = data['unique_field']\n           if unique_value in existing_records:\n               # Update fields\n               obj = existing_records[unique_value]\n               obj.field2 = data['field2']\n               updated_objects.append(obj)\n           else:\n               # Create new object\n               new_objects.append(MyModel(**data))\n\n       with transaction.atomic():\n           if new_objects:\n               MyModel.objects.bulk_create(new_objects)\n           if updated_objects:\n               MyModel.objects.bulk_update(updated_objects, ['field2', 'field3'])\n       ```\n\n3. **Periodic Task with Celery**:\n   - If this operation is time-consuming, consider offloading it to Celery, a distributed task queue, which can handle the task periodically and asynchronously.\n\nUsing these methods will reduce the number of database hits and ensure that your application remains performant when dealing with large datasets."
