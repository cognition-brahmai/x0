If I know the number of elements, I can do comparisons like: for a in b: for c in d: for x in y: ..., but this won't work if I don't know how many elements p has. I've looked at a solution that compares two lists but after trying to make it recursive, I haven't been able to find a solution. Could you please help me with this?"

        "content": "Certainly! To find the common elements in a list of lists, you can use Python's set operations. By leveraging the `set` data structure, you can efficiently find intersections between multiple lists, regardless of how many lists there are in the main list. Here's a function that does exactly that:\n\n```python\ndef common(lists):\n    if not lists:\n        return []\n\n    # Start with the first list converted to a set\n    common_elements = set(lists[0])\n\n    # Iterate over the remaining lists and perform intersection\n    for lst in lists[1:]:\n        common_elements.intersection_update(lst)\n\n    # Convert the set back to a list and return\n    return list(common_elements)\n\n# Example usage\np = [[1, 2, 3], [1, 9, 9], [1, 2, 4]]\nprint(common(p))  # Output: [1]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: Start by assuming the common elements are the elements of the first list, converted into a set.\n2. **Intersection**: For each subsequent list, update the set of common elements by intersecting it with the current list.\n3. **Result**: Convert the resulting set of common elements back into a list before returning it.\n\nThis approach is efficient and works regardless of the number of lists in your main list `p`. It handles empty lists and returns an empty list if there are no common elements."
