Can you provide an example code that achieves this?\nHere is an example code that can achieve this:\nstring = \"Hello World\"\nbinary_array = string.chars.map{|char| char.ord.to_s(2)}\nbinary_string = binary_array.join(\" \")\nputs binary_string\nThis code first converts the string into an array of its characters, then uses the map method to convert each character into its ASCII value in binary form using the ord and to_s methods. Finally, it joins the binary values into a string separated by spaces and prints the result."

        "content": "Your example code effectively converts a string into its binary representation based on ASCII values. Here's a detailed explanation and a slightly refined version of the code for converting a string to its binary representation:\n\n```ruby\nstring = \"Hello World\"\nbinary_array = string.chars.map { |char| char.ord.to_s(2).rjust(8, '0') }\nbinary_string = binary_array.join(\" \")\nputs binary_string\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`string.chars`**: Converts the string into an array of its characters.\n2. **`map`**: Iterates over each character in the array.\n3. **`char.ord`**: Gets the ASCII value of the character.\n4. **`to_s(2)`**: Converts the ASCII value to a binary string.\n5. **`rjust(8, '0')`**: Ensures that each binary string is 8 bits long by padding with leading zeros if necessary. This keeps the binary representation consistent for each character.\n6. **`join(\" \")`**: Joins the array of binary strings into a single string, separated by spaces.\n7. **`puts`**: Outputs the resulting binary string.\n\nThis code will output the binary representation of each character in the string \"Hello World\", with each character separated by a space."
