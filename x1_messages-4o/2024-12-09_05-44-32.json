        "content": "The error message you're encountering indicates that there is an attempt to use the method `read()` on a string object, which does not possess this method. The issue arises in this line:\n\n```python\nreturn json.load(jsonStr)['data']['children']\n```\n\nHere's what might be causing the error:\n\n1. **Incorrect Use of `json.load()`:**  \n   The function `json.load()` is designed to parse JSON data from a file-like object (such as a file or a response object that has a `.read()` method). However, you are passing a string `jsonStr` to it. Instead, you should use `json.loads()`, which is used for parsing a JSON-encoded string.\n\n2. **Correcting the Code:**\n   Replace `json.load(jsonStr)` with `json.loads(jsonStr)`:\n\n   ```python\n   import json\n   import urllib2\n\n   def getEntries(self, sub):\n       url = 'http://www.reddit.com/'\n       if sub != '':\n           url += 'r/' + sub\n\n       request = urllib2.Request(url + '.json', None, {'User-Agent': 'Reddit desktop client by /user/RobinJ1995/'})\n       response = urllib2.urlopen(request)\n       jsonStr = response.read()\n\n       return json.loads(jsonStr)['data']['children']\n   ```\n\n3. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Ensure that the URL you are accessing is correct and that you have a valid internet connection.\n   - Check that the Reddit API endpoint requires a specific user agent to avoid being blocked.\n   - Be mindful of Reddit's API rate limits and terms of service when making requests.\n\nBy making these adjustments, your function should be able to parse the JSON response correctly without encountering the `AttributeError`."
