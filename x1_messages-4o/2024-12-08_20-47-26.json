This means that out of every 5 parts of the mixture, 3 parts are water and 2 parts are alcohol.\n\n   - Water: \\((3/5) \\times 100 = 60\\) liters\n   - Alcohol: \\((2/5) \\times 100 = 40\\) liters\n\n2. **Remove 10 liters of the mixture:**\n\n   The mixture is removed in the same ratio of 3:2. Therefore, in the 10 liters removed:\n\n   - Water removed: \\((3/5) \\times 10 = 6\\) liters\n   - Alcohol removed: \\((2/5) \\times 10 = 4\\) liters\n\n3. **Calculate the remaining amounts of water and alcohol:**\n\n   After removing 10 liters, the remaining amounts are:\n\n   - Remaining water: \\(60 - 6 = 54\\) liters\n   - Remaining alcohol: \\(40 - 4 = 36\\) liters\n\n4. **Replace the removed mixture with 10 liters of pure water:**\n\n   - New amount of water: \\(54 + 10 = 64\\) liters\n   - The amount of alcohol remains the same at 36 liters.\n\n5. **Calculate the new ratio of water to alcohol:**\n\n   The new ratio of water to alcohol is \\(64:36\\).\n\n6. **Simplify the ratio:**\n\n   Divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:\n\n   - Water: \\(64 \\div 4 = 16\\)\n   - Alcohol: \\(36 \\div 4 = 9\\)\n\n   So the simplified ratio is \\(16:9\\).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of water to alcohol in the container now is \\(16:9\\)."
