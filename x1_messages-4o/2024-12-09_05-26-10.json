I am using the following code:\n\n```bash\ntext=\"this is line one\\n\nthis is line two\\n\nthis is line three\"\n\necho -e $text > filename\n```\n\nI expect the output in the file to be:\n\n```bash\nthis is line one\nthis is line two\nthis is line three\n```\n\nBut what I get instead is:\n\n```bash\nthis is line one\n this is line two\n this is line three\n```\n\nI am certain that I have not added a space after each \"\\n\". Where could these extra spaces be coming from?"

        "content": "The extra spaces you're encountering are likely due to how the shell is handling the newline characters and the variable expansion. When you define a multi-line string with inline newlines using quotes, the shell might interpret those newlines with spaces or tabs that are present in your script.\n\nTo correct this, you can avoid the extra spaces by using a different approach to define your multi-line string. Here\u2019s a revised version of your script:\n\n```bash\ntext=\"this is line one\nthis is line two\nthis is line three\"\n\necho -e \"$text\" > filename\n```\n\nNotice that I've removed the `\\n` from the string and placed the lines directly under each other. Also, ensure that the variable is enclosed in double quotes when passed to `echo`. This way, the shell will interpret it correctly as a multi-line string without adding extra spaces.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a here document to achieve the same result:\n\n```bash\ncat <<EOF > filename\nthis is line one\nthis is line two\nthis is line three\nEOF\n```\n\nBoth approaches should give you the desired output without the extra spaces."
