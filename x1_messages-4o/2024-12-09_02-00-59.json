Currently, when I launch Jupyter Notebook through the command prompt, it only shows directories inside the C drive. All the solutions I have found so far involve changing the notebook startup path."

You can switch drives by typing the drive letter followed by a colon. For example, if your files are on the D drive, type:\n\n   ```\n   D:\n   ```\n\n2. **Navigate to the Desired Directory:**\n   Once you're on the correct drive, use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory containing your Jupyter Notebook. For example:\n\n   ```\n   cd path\\to\\your\\notebooks\n   ```\n\n   Replace `path\\to\\your\\notebooks` with the actual path to your files.\n\n3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**\n   After navigating to the directory, simply start Jupyter Notebook by typing:\n\n   ```\n   jupyter notebook\n   ```\n\n   This will open Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser, and you'll see the contents of the directory you're currently in, not limited to the C drive.\n\nBy following these steps, you can open Jupyter Notebooks from any drive on your system without altering the startup path permanently."
