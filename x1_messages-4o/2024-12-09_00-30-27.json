I am running my tests using `pytest my_tests.py`. According to the pytest documentation, print statements should work by default. Here is the code in my test class:\n\n```\nimport myapplication as tum\n\nclass TestBlogger:\n\n    @classmethod\n    def setup_class(self):\n        self.user = \"alice\"\n        self.b = tum.Blogger(self.user)\n        print \"This should be printed, but it won't be!\"\n\n    def test_inherit(self):\n        assert issubclass(tum.Blogger, tum.Site)\n        links = self.b.get_links(posts)\n        print len(links)   # This won't print either.\n```\n\nAlso, the script I'm testing contains print statements:\n\n```\nclass Blogger(Site):\n    get_links(self, posts):\n        print len(posts)   # It won't get printed in the test.\n```\n\nDespite this, nothing gets printed to my standard output console, apart from the normal progress and how many tests passed or failed. In Python's `unittest` module, everything gets printed by default, which is what I need. However, I would like to use `pytest` for other reasons. How can I make the print statements get shown when using pytest?"

        "content": "When using `pytest`, print statements are captured by default to keep the test output clean. However, you can change this behavior to see the print output in your console. There are a few ways you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Disable Output Capturing Temporarily:**\n   You can run pytest with the `-s` option to disable capturing:\n\n   ```bash\n   pytest -s my_tests.py\n   ```\n\n   This will allow all print statements to be shown in the console.\n\n2. **Modify pytest Configuration:**\n   You can add a configuration file (e.g., `pytest.ini`, `tox.ini`, or `setup.cfg`) and set the `addopts` option to always disable capturing:\n\n   ```ini\n   [pytest]\n   addopts = -s\n   ```\n\n3. **Use `capfd` Fixture:**\n   If you want more control and need to capture output within your tests, you can use the `capfd` or `capsys` fixture provided by pytest to capture and assert on output. Here's an example using `capfd`:\n\n   ```python\n   import myapplication as tum\n\n   class TestBlogger:\n\n       @classmethod\n       def setup_class(cls):\n           cls.user = \"alice\"\n           cls.b = tum.Blogger(cls.user)\n           print(\"This should be printed, but it won't be!\")\n\n       def test_inherit(self, capfd):\n           assert issubclass(tum.Blogger, tum.Site)\n           posts = []  # Ensure `posts` is defined\n           links = self.b.get_links(posts)\n           print(len(links))  # This won't print to console directly\n           \n           # Capture and check output\n           out, err = capfd.readouterr()\n           assert str(len(posts)) in out  # Example assertion on captured output\n   ```\n\n4. **Use Logging Instead of Print:**\n   Consider using the `logging` module, which can be configured to print to the console or a file, and can be controlled at a finer granularity. However, this requires modifying your application and tests to use logging instead of print.\n\nBy using one of these methods, you should be able to see the print outputs in your console when running tests with pytest."
