You can create a Python function that takes a list and a specified value as input, and then returns a new list with all elements that are greater than the specified value removed. Here's one way to do it:\n\n```python\ndef remove_greater_than(input_list, threshold):\n    \"\"\"\n    Removes elements from the list that are greater than the specified threshold.\n\n    Parameters:\n    input_list (list): The list of elements to process.\n    threshold (int or float): The value above which elements will be removed.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: A new list with elements less than or equal to the threshold.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [element for element in input_list if element <= threshold]\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_list = [1, 5, 8, 12, 3, 7, 4]\nthreshold_value = 6\nfiltered_list = remove_greater_than(my_list, threshold_value)\nprint(filtered_list)  # Output: [1, 5, 3, 4]\n```\n\nIn this function, a list comprehension is used to iterate through `input_list` and include only those elements that are less than or equal to the `threshold` value. The resulting list is returned."
