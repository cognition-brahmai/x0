I tried using the `formatdate` function from `email.Utils` and passing `datetime.datetime.now()` as the argument, but I encountered a TypeError indicating that a float is required. Here is the code and error message:\n\n```python\nfrom email.Utils import formatdate\nimport datetime\nformatdate(datetime.datetime.now())\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/email/utils.py\", line 159, in formatdate\n    now = time.gmtime(timeval)\nTypeError: a float is required\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is because the `formatdate` function from the `email.utils` module (note the lowercase 'u' in 'utils' for Python 3) expects a timestamp as a float, not a `datetime` object directly. The `datetime` object needs to be converted to a timestamp (a float representing seconds since the epoch) before it can be used with `formatdate`. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom email.utils import formatdate\nimport datetime\n\n# Get the current time as a datetime object\nnow = datetime.datetime.now()\n\n# Convert the datetime object to a timestamp\ntimestamp = now.timestamp()\n\n# Use formatdate to convert the timestamp to an RFC 2822 formatted string\nrfc_2822_date = formatdate(timestamp)\n\nprint(rfc_2822_date)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Conversion to Timestamp**: We use the `timestamp()` method on the `datetime` object to convert it to a timestamp. This gives us the number of seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970).\n\n2. **Formatting to RFC 2822**: The `formatdate` function can now take this timestamp and convert it to an RFC 2822 formatted date string.\n\nThis should resolve the `TypeError` you were encountering. Note that if you're using Python 2, the `timestamp()` method may not be available, and you might need to use an alternative method to get the timestamp."
