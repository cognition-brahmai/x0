Is there a built-in function that I can use for this, or could you provide a few lines of code that could help in achieving this?"

        "content": "Certainly! In Python, you can use the `traceback` module to format traceback objects similarly to how `traceback.format_exc()` works. The `traceback` module provides several useful functions for extracting, formatting, and printing stack traces of Python programs.\n\nTo format a traceback object, you can use the `traceback.format_exception()` function. This function takes the exception type, exception instance, and a traceback object and returns a list of strings, each representing a line of the formatted traceback.\n\nHere's a small example to illustrate how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport traceback\nimport sys\n\ndef function_that_raises():\n    raise ValueError(\"An error occurred!\")\n\ntry:\n    function_that_raises()\nexcept Exception as e:\n    # Get the exception type, value and traceback object\n    exc_type, exc_value, exc_tb = sys.exc_info()\n    \n    # Format the exception using traceback.format_exception\n    formatted_traceback = traceback.format_exception(exc_type, exc_value, exc_tb)\n    \n    # Join the list into a single string to display or log\n    traceback_string = \"\".join(formatted_traceback)\n    print(traceback_string)\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- `sys.exc_info()` is used to get the exception type, value, and traceback object when an exception is caught.\n- `traceback.format_exception()` is then used to format these details into a list of strings.\n- Finally, the list of strings is joined into a single string for display or logging purposes.\n\nThis approach will give you a formatted traceback similar to the output of `traceback.format_exc()`."
