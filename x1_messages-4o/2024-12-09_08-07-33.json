I want the script to close the windows that were opened during the previous run. I've tried using the command 'plt.close(\"all\")' which works when I run the script from the Python shell, but it doesn't seem to work when I run the script using Eclipse / PyDev. Can you suggest a way to make it work in Eclipse?\n\nHere is an example of the script I'm using:\n\n```python\nfrom numpy import *\nfrom matplotlib.pyplot import *\nfrom scipy import *\n\nclose(\"all\") \n    #close any previously open plots - this doesn't work when running via Eclipse\n\nt = linspace(0, 0.1,1000)\nw = 60*2*pi\n\nfigure()\nplot(t,cos(w*t))\nplot(t,cos(w*t-2*pi/3))\nplot(t,cos(w*t-4*pi/3))\nshow()\n```\n\nThis script is supposed to plot the ideal waveforms for a 3-phase power supply."

        "content": "When using Eclipse with PyDev, the behavior of closing plots with `plt.close(\"all\")` might not work as expected due to the way the environment handles plot windows. Here are a few suggestions to ensure that the plots from previous runs are closed before opening new ones:\n\n1. **Use `matplotlib.pyplot` directly:** Make sure you're using `matplotlib.pyplot` functions consistently. Import it as a conventional alias and use it directly.\n\n2. **Explicitly close figures:** Ensure that you explicitly close figures at the end of your script to prevent them from hanging around.\n\n3. **Backend Considerations:** Eclipse might be using a different backend that handles windows in a non-standard way. You can specify a different backend to see if it resolves the issue. Add this line at the top of your script before importing `matplotlib.pyplot`:\n\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib\n   matplotlib.use('TkAgg')  # or 'Qt5Agg', 'Agg', etc.\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Interactive Mode:** Ensure that interactive mode is turned off with `matplotlib.pyplot.ioff()` if you want to manage the plot windows manually.\n\nHere is a revised version of your script with these considerations:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib\nmatplotlib.use('TkAgg')  # Ensure a consistent backend\n\nfrom numpy import linspace, pi, cos\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nplt.close(\"all\")  # Close any previously open plots\n\nt = linspace(0, 0.1, 1000)\nw = 60 * 2 * pi\n\nplt.figure()\nplt.plot(t, cos(w * t))\nplt.plot(t, cos(w * t - 2 * pi / 3))\nplt.plot(t, cos(w * t - 4 * pi / 3))\nplt.show()\n\n# Explicitly close figures at the end of the script\nplt.close(\"all\")\n```\n\nTry running this script in Eclipse with PyDev. If the issue persists, experiment with different backends or check if there are any specific configurations in Eclipse that might affect how it handles plot windows."
