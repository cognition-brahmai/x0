        "content": "The Go code you provided is a basic web scraper designed to retrieve information about the phrase \"to have a skeleton in the closet\" from a webpage. The code uses the `net/http` package to send an HTTP GET request to a specific URL and the `io/ioutil` package to read the response body. It then searches the HTML content for specific tags and extracts the relevant information about the origin of the phrase and famous people associated with it.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of what the code does:\n\n1. **HTTP Request**: It sends a GET request to \"https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/skeleton-in-the-closet.html\".\n\n2. **Read Response**: It reads the response body and converts it to a string.\n\n3. **Extract Origin**: It searches for the string \"<p>Origin:</p>\" in the HTML, extracts the text immediately following this string up to the next `</div>` tag, and prints it as the origin of the phrase.\n\n4. **Extract Famous People**: Similarly, it searches for \"<p>Famous People:</p>\", extracts the following text up to the next `</div>` tag, and prints it as the list of famous people.\n\n**Note**: The webpage structure might not exactly match your code, and this code assumes specific HTML tags are present. In practice, HTML structures can be more complex, and using a proper HTML parsing library like `goquery` would be more robust. Also, ensure that the website allows web scraping by checking its `robots.txt` file or terms of service.\n\nTo run this code, you need to have Go installed on your machine, and you must replace the placeholder tags with the actual ones from the webpage if they differ. Additionally, handle any errors according to your needs, and be aware of legal considerations regarding web scraping."
