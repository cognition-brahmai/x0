        "content": "To sort the keys of a dictionary based on their corresponding integer values in Python, you can use the `sorted()` function along with a lambda function to specify that you want to sort by the values. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Example dictionary\nmy_dict = {'a': 3, 'b': 1, 'c': 2}\n\n# Sort the keys based on their corresponding values\nsorted_keys = sorted(my_dict.keys(), key=lambda x: my_dict[x])\n\nprint(sorted_keys)\n```\n\nIn this example, `sorted()` takes two arguments:\n- `my_dict.keys()`: Returns a view of the dictionary's keys.\n- `key=lambda x: my_dict[x]`: A lambda function that tells `sorted()` to use the value of each key for sorting.\n\nThe result will be a list of keys sorted based on their values: `['b', 'c', 'a']` in this example. If you want to sort the keys in descending order based on their values, you can add the `reverse=True` argument to the `sorted()` function:\n\n```python\n# Sort the keys in descending order based on their values\nsorted_keys_desc = sorted(my_dict.keys(), key=lambda x: my_dict[x], reverse=True)\n\nprint(sorted_keys_desc)\n```\n\nThis will give you the keys sorted in descending order: `['a', 'c', 'b']`."
