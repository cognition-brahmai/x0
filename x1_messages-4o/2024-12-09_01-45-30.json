        "content": "To resolve the issue of CMake not finding the CUDA installation, you should ensure that the environment variable `CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR` is set correctly and that it is visible to the CMake process. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you resolve this:\n\n1. **Verify CUDA Installation Path:**\n   First, ensure that the path you specified in your `.bashrc` file actually points to a valid CUDA installation. You can check this by listing the contents of the directory:\n   ```bash\n   ls /usr/local/cuda-5.5\n   ```\n\n   If the directory exists and contains subdirectories like `bin`, `lib`, `include`, etc., then the path is likely correct.\n\n2. **Update .bashrc and Source It:**\n   Make sure that the environment variable is correctly set in your `.bashrc` file and that the changes are applied to your current session. Open your `.bashrc` file and ensure it contains the line:\n   ```bash\n   export CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/cuda-5.5\n   ```\n\n   After editing, apply the changes by running:\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bashrc\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify Environment Variable:**\n   Confirm that the environment variable is set correctly by running:\n   ```bash\n   echo $CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR\n   ```\n   This should output `/usr/local/cuda-5.5`.\n\n4. **Pass the Variable to CMake:**\n   When you run CMake, you can explicitly pass the `CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR` as an argument to ensure it's recognized:\n   ```bash\n   cmake -DCUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/cuda-5.5 ..\n   ```\n\n5. **Check CMakeLists.txt:**\n   Ensure that your `CMakeLists.txt` is set up to look for CUDA using the `find_package` command. It should look something like this:\n   ```cmake\n   find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)\n   ```\n\n6. **Verify CUDA Environment:**\n   Sometimes, CMake might not detect CUDA properly due to missing environment variables like `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Make sure these are set:\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-5.5/bin:$PATH\n   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-5.5/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n   ```\n\n7. **Re-run CMake:**\n   Once you've verified everything, try running CMake again:\n   ```bash\n   cmake ..\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to configure your build environment to find the CUDA installation properly. If you continue to face issues, consider checking for any typos in paths or verifying that your CUDA installation is complete and not corrupted."
