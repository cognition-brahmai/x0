I am currently using the `hmset` function to set the value of each field, but I have found that when the value itself is a complex structured object, the value returned from `hget` is a serialized string, not the original object. For example, when I run the following code:\n\n```python\nimages= [{'type':'big', 'url':'....'},\n     {'type':'big', 'url':'....'},\n     {'type':'big', 'url':'....'}]   \n\nredis = Redis()\nredis.hset('photo:1', 'images', images)\n\ni = redis.hget('photo:1', 'images')\nprint type(i)\n```\n\nThe type of `i` is a string, not a Python object. Is there a solution to this problem that doesn't involve manually parsing each field?"

        "content": "To store complex objects in Redis using `redis-py`, you need to serialize these objects before storing them and deserialize them after retrieving them. Redis itself doesn't understand Python objects, so when you store a complex object, it needs to be converted into a format that Redis can handle, typically a string. Common serialization formats include JSON and pickle.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this using JSON serialization:\n\n1. **Serialize the object before storing it:**\n\n```python\nimport json\nfrom redis import Redis\n\nimages = [{'type': 'big', 'url': '....'},\n          {'type': 'big', 'url': '....'},\n          {'type': 'big', 'url': '....'}]\n\nredis = Redis()\n\n# Serialize the `images` list to a JSON string\nimages_json = json.dumps(images)\n\n# Store the serialized JSON string in Redis\nredis.hset('photo:1', 'images', images_json)\n```\n\n2. **Deserialize the object after retrieving it:**\n\n```python\n# Retrieve the serialized JSON string from Redis\nimages_json = redis.hget('photo:1', 'images')\n\n# Deserialize the JSON string back to a Python object\nimages = json.loads(images_json)\n\nprint(type(images))  # This will now be a list\n```\n\n### Considerations:\n- **JSON vs. Pickle:** JSON is human-readable and language-independent, making it a good choice for simple objects. However, it only works with data types that can be represented in JSON (e.g., dictionaries, lists, strings, numbers). If your objects include complex data types or Python-specific objects, you might consider using `pickle`. Keep in mind that `pickle` is Python-specific and not human-readable.\n  \n- **Encoding:** When using JSON, ensure that any strings you serialize are properly encoded/decoded as needed (e.g., UTF-8).\n\n- **Security:** Be cautious when using `pickle` due to potential security risks when loading pickled data from untrusted sources.\n\nIf you need to store more complex objects or want to explore other serialization options, you might also consider using libraries like `msgpack` for more efficient binary serialization, or `marshal` for Python-specific serialization."
