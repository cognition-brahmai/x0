Currently, my program runs like this:\n\n```python\nrun_my_program()\n# Output: tasks done, now sleeping for 10 seconds\n```\n\nI want it to display a countdown like 10, 9, 8, 7... Is this possible?"

        "content": "Yes, it's possible to display a countdown in the shell while the program is sleeping. You can achieve this by using a loop that iterates every second and updates the countdown display. Here\u2019s an example of how you can modify your program to include a countdown:\n\n```python\nimport time\nimport sys\n\ndef run_my_program():\n    # Sample function to simulate your program's tasks\n    print(\"Tasks done, now sleeping for 10 seconds\")\n\ndef countdown(seconds):\n    for i in range(seconds, 0, -1):\n        # Print the countdown number and flush the output\n        sys.stdout.write(f\"\\rSleeping... {i} seconds remaining\")\n        sys.stdout.flush()\n        time.sleep(1)\n    # Clear the line after countdown is complete\n    sys.stdout.write(\"\\rCountdown complete!            \\n\")\n\nrun_my_program()\ncountdown(10)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **`sys.stdout.write` and `sys.stdout.flush`**: These are used to print the countdown on the same line. The `\\r` character moves the cursor back to the beginning of the line, allowing the countdown number to be updated in place.\n2. **`time.sleep(1)`**: This makes the loop iterate every second, effectively creating a countdown.\n3. **Clearing the Line**: After the countdown is complete, the line is cleared to give a clean output. \n\nThis approach provides a simple yet effective way to implement a countdown in the shell."
