        "content": "To formulate the equation of a circle, we use the standard equation for a circle centered at \\((h, k)\\) with radius \\(r\\):\n\n\\[\n(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\n\\]\n\nFor a circle centered at \\((1, -2)\\) with a radius of 5, the equation is:\n\n\\[\n(x - 1)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 25\n\\]\n\nTo express this in polar coordinates, we can substitute:\n\n\\[\nx = r \\cos \\theta + h = 5 \\cos \\theta + 1\n\\]\n\\[\ny = r \\sin \\theta + k = 5 \\sin \\theta - 2\n\\]\n\nThus, the polar equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n(r \\cos \\theta - 1)^2 + (r \\sin \\theta + 2)^2 = 25\n\\]\n\n### Graph of the Circle using LaTeX\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{standalone}\n\\usepackage{tikz}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{tikzpicture}\n    % Draw the circle\n    \\draw[thick] (1,-2) circle (5);\n\n    % Mark the center\n    \\fill[black] (1,-2) circle (0.08) node[below right] {$(1, -2)$};\n\n    % Mark the point (3, 4)\n    \\fill[black] (3,4) circle (0.08) node[above right] {$(3, 4)$};\n\n    % Mark the point (-2, -5)\n    \\fill[black] (-2,-5) circle (0.08) node[below left] {$(-2, -5)$};\n\n    % Draw axes\n    \\draw[->] (-8,0) -- (8,0) node[right] {$x$};\n    \\draw[->] (0,-8) -- (0,8) node[above] {$y$};\n\n    % Label the radius\n    \\draw[thick, dashed] (1,-2) -- (6,-2) node[midway, below] {$5$};\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n### Python Function to Calculate the Area of the Sector\n\nThe area of a sector of a circle is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\theta\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\theta\\) is the angle in radians between the two radii. To find \\(\\theta\\), we'll use the coordinates of the point on the circle and the intersection points of the circle with the x-axis. Here's a Python function to compute this:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef sector_area(x, y):\n    # Center of the circle\n    h, k = 1, -2\n    # Radius of the circle\n    r = 5\n    \n    # Calculate intersection points with the x-axis\n    # Solve (y + 2)^2 = 25 for y = 0\n    y_intersection_points = [-2 + math.sqrt(25 - 0**2), -2 - math.sqrt(25 - 0**2)]\n    \n    # Calculate angle using dot product\n    # Vectors from center to (x, y) and (1, 0)\n    vector1 = (x - h, y - k)\n    vector2 = (1 - h, 0 - k)\n    \n    # Dot product and magnitudes\n    dot_prod = vector1[0] * vector2[0] + vector1[1] * vector2[1]\n    magnitude1 = math.sqrt(vector1[0]**2 + vector1[1]**2)\n    magnitude2 = math.sqrt(vector2[0]**2 + vector2[1]**2)\n    \n    # Angle calculation\n    theta = math.acos(dot_prod / (magnitude1 * magnitude2))\n    \n    # Calculate sector area\n    area = 0.5 * r**2 * theta\n    return area\n\n# Example usage: \n# point = (3, 4) (or any other point on the circle)\narea = sector_area(3, 4)\nprint(\"Area of the sector:\", area)\n```\n\nThis function takes any point on the circle, calculates the angle subtended by the arc at the center of the circle, and then computes the area of the sector formed by that arc and the two points where the circle intersects the x-axis."
