The query invokes an auto-flush which tries to store an instance having a NULL value thus violating the NOT NULL constraint. I get an error message as follows:\n\n```python\nsqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError: (raised as a result of Query-invoked autoflush; \nconsider using a session.no_autoflush block if this flush is occurring prematurely)\n(sqlite3.IntegrityError) NOT NULL constraint failed: X.nn \n[SQL: 'INSERT INTO \"X\" (nn, val) VALUES (?, ?)'] [parameters: (None, 1)]\n```\n\nIs there a way to block the auto-flush? Here is the code sample:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport os.path\nimport os\nimport sqlalchemy as sa \nimport sqlalchemy.orm as sao\nimport sqlalchemy.ext.declarative as sad\nfrom sqlalchemy_utils import create_database\n\n_Base = sad.declarative_base()\nsession = None\n\n\nclass X(_Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'X'\n\n    _oid = sa.Column('oid', sa.Integer, primary_key=True)\n    _nn = sa.Column('nn', sa.Integer, nullable=False) # NOT NULL!\n    _val = sa.Column('val', sa.Integer)\n\n    def __init__(self, val):\n        self._val = val\n\n    def test(self, session):\n        q = session.query(X).filter(X._val == self._val)\n        x = q.one()\n        print('x={}'.format(x))\n\ndbfile = 'x.db'\n\ndef _create_database():\n    if os.path.exists(dbfile):\n        os.remove(dbfile)\n\n    engine = sa.create_engine('sqlite:///{}'.format(dbfile), echo=True)\n    create_database(engine.url)\n    _Base.metadata.create_all(engine)\n    return sao.sessionmaker(bind=engine)()\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    session = _create_database()\n\n    for val in range(3):\n        x = X(val)\n        x._nn = 0\n        session.add(x)\n    session.commit()\n\n    x = X(1)\n    session.add(x)\n    x.test(session)\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering stems from SQLAlchemy's default behavior of autoflush. Autoflush is a mechanism in SQLAlchemy that automatically synchronizes the state of the session with the database before certain operations, like queries, are executed. This ensures that the query operates on the most up-to-date data. However, in some cases, this can lead to unintended consequences, such as the one you're experiencing, where an incomplete object is attempted to be flushed to the database, resulting in an integrity error.\n\nIn your code, the `test` method is querying the database, which triggers an autoflush of the session. Since the object `x` with a `None` value for `_nn` is added to the session but not yet committed, the autoflush attempts to insert it into the database, resulting in a violation of the NOT NULL constraint.\n\nTo prevent this, you can temporarily disable autoflush within the scope of a particular code block using the `session.no_autoflush` context manager. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\ndef test(self, session):\n    with session.no_autoflush:\n        q = session.query(X).filter(X._val == self._val)\n        x = q.one()\n        print('x={}'.format(x))\n```\n\nBy wrapping the query with `session.no_autoflush`, you prevent the session from automatically flushing changes before executing the query, thereby avoiding the integrity error. This allows you to control when the changes are flushed to the database explicitly, typically by calling `session.commit()` at an appropriate point in your program.\n\nMake sure to use this approach judiciously, as it can lead to inconsistencies if not managed carefully. Always ensure that the session is appropriately flushed or committed when necessary to maintain data integrity."
