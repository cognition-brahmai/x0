For instance, if I compile a CUDA program with a lower Compute Capability, such as 1.3 (using the nvcc flag sm_13), and run it on a device with Compute Capability 2.1, will it utilize the features of Compute 2.1? In this situation, will the compute 2.1 device behave as if it has a compute 1.3 capability?"

        "content": "When you compile a CUDA program for a specific Compute Capability (CC), such as 1.3, using the `-arch=sm_13` flag, the resulting binary is optimized for that specific CC. This means that the program can run on devices with Compute Capability 1.3 or higher, but it will not automatically take advantage of features or optimizations available in higher Compute Capabilities, like 2.1.\n\nIf you run a binary compiled for CC 1.3 on a device with CC 2.1, the device will execute the program as if it were a 1.3 device. This means it will not use any of the features or improvements introduced in CC 2.1. The device does not automatically upgrade the binary to utilize newer features; it simply ensures compatibility to run the code.\n\nTo leverage the new features and optimizations of a higher Compute Capability, you would need to compile your program with the appropriate architecture flag, such as `-arch=sm_21` for CC 2.1. This would allow the compiler to generate code that can utilize the enhancements and capabilities of CC 2.1 devices. You can also use the `-arch` and `-code` flags to compile for multiple architectures, ensuring your application runs efficiently on a range of devices."
