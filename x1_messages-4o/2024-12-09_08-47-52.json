        "content": "Creating a C# program to print out a multiplication table from 1 to 10 is a great way to practice your programming skills. Below is a simple example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass MultiplicationTable\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        // Outer loop for each number from 1 to 10\n        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)\n        {\n            // Inner loop for the multiplication of the current number\n            for (int j = 1; j <= 10; j++)\n            {\n                // Print the result of the multiplication\n                Console.Write($\"{i * j}\\t\");\n            }\n            // Move to the next line after each row\n            Console.WriteLine();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Outer Loop (`for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)`)**: This loop iterates through numbers 1 to 10, representing the multiplicand.\n\n2. **Inner Loop (`for (int j = 1; j <= 10; j++)`)**: This loop also iterates through numbers 1 to 10, representing the multiplier.\n\n3. **Multiplication and Display (`Console.Write($\"{i * j}\\t\")`)**: Inside the inner loop, the multiplicand `i` is multiplied by the multiplier `j`, and the result is printed. The `\\t` is used to add a tab space for better formatting.\n\n4. **New Line (`Console.WriteLine()`)**: After each row of the multiplication table is printed, a new line is started to properly format the table.\n\nThis program will print a neatly formatted multiplication table for numbers 1 through 10. You can modify the ranges of the loops if you want to generate a table of different sizes."
