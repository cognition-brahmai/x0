        "content": "How can I start a Celery worker from a script or module __main__? I have defined a Celery app in a module and I want to start the worker from the same module in its __main__. I want to do this by running the module with python -m instead of celery from the command line. I have tried the following code:\n\n```python\napp = Celery('project', include=['project.tasks'])\n\n# do all kind of project-specific configuration\n# that should occur whenever this module is imported\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # log stuff about the configuration\n    app.start(['worker', '-A', 'project.tasks'])\n```\n\nHowever, now Celery thinks I'm running the worker without arguments:\n\n```bash\nUsage: worker <command> [options] \n\nShow help screen and exit.\n\nOptions:\n  -A APP, --app=APP     app instance to use (e.g. module.attr_name)\n[snip]\n```\n\nThe usage message is the one you get from celery --help, as if it didn't get a command. I have also tried the following:\n\n```python\napp.worker_main(['-A', 'project.tasks'])\n```\n\nBut that complains about the -A not being recognized. How can I start a Celery worker from a script or module __main__? Or alternatively, how do I pass a callback to the worker to have it log information about its configuration?"

        "content": "To start a Celery worker programmatically from within a Python script or module, you'll need to use the `worker_main` method correctly. The issue you're encountering is due to passing arguments in a way that Celery doesn't expect. Here's a way to do it:\n\n1. **Ensure Correct Argument Passing**: The first argument in the list you pass to `worker_main` should be the script name (conventionally `sys.argv[0]`), followed by other arguments just like you would provide on the command line.\n\n2. **Correct Import Path**: Make sure that the app's import path is correctly specified when you pass it along with `-A`.\n\nHere is a refined example of how you might set this up:\n\n```python\nfrom celery import Celery\nimport sys\n\n# Create a Celery app\napp = Celery('project', include=['project.tasks'])\n\n# Do all kinds of project-specific configuration\n# that should occur whenever this module is imported\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Log stuff about the configuration, if needed\n\n    # Start the worker\n    argv = [\n        'worker',          # Equivalent to celery worker\n        '-A', 'project',   # Specify the app name\n        '--loglevel=info', # Optional: Set log level to info\n    ]\n    app.worker_main(argv)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`argv` List**: Simulates the command-line arguments passed to a Celery worker. Here, `'worker'` is the command indicating that you're starting a worker, and `'-A', 'project'` specifies the Celery application instance.\n- **Log Level**: You can adjust the log level using `--loglevel=info` or other levels like `debug`, `warning`, etc., as needed.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Module Path**: Ensure your module path (`'project'` in this case) is correctly specified and accessible in your Python path.\n- **Environment Variables**: Check if any environment variables need to be set for your application, such as broker or backend URLs.\n\nThis setup should let you start a Celery worker from within your script or module, providing the flexibility to run it via `python -m`."
