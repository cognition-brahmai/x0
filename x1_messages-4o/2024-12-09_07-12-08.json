The current method I'm using is through the normal bracket indexing as shown below:\n\n```python\ndf_filtered = df[df['column'] == value]\n```\nHowever, this method is not satisfying because it requires me to assign `df` to a variable before being able to filter its values. Is there a method similar to the following?\n\n```python\ndf_filtered = df.mask(lambda x: x['column'] == value)\n```"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve a similar result using method chaining in pandas by using the `.query()` or `.pipe()` methods. These methods allow for more fluent and readable code without the need to explicitly assign the DataFrame to a variable before filtering. Here are examples using both approaches:\n\n### Using `.query()`\nThe `.query()` method allows you to filter DataFrames using a string expression. This can make your code more readable and concise.\n\n```python\ndf_filtered = df.query('column == @value')\n```\n\nIn this example, `@value` is a way to reference the variable `value` within the query string.\n\n### Using `.pipe()`\nThe `.pipe()` method can be used to apply a function to the DataFrame, allowing for custom filtering logic.\n\n```python\ndf_filtered = df.pipe(lambda x: x[x['column'] == value])\n```\n\nIn this approach, you use a lambda function to perform the filtering operation. The `.pipe()` method is versatile and can be useful when you want to chain multiple operations together.\n\nBoth methods allow you to chain operations without having to assign the DataFrame to a variable first, thus achieving a more streamlined and elegant code."
