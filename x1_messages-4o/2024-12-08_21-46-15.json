Furthermore, you need to sort the jars based on the total amount of their marbles in descending order, but only considering the blue marbles. Finally, display this information in a bar chart in your app's UI. Good luck!"

        "content": "To achieve this task, we need to follow several steps: \n\n1. **Extract the Non-Red Marbles**: We'll go through each jar and calculate the average amount of marbles that are not red.\n\n2. **Sort Jars by Blue Marbles**: We'll sort the jars based on the total number of blue marbles in descending order.\n\n3. **Display a Bar Chart**: We'll visualize the sorted data in a bar chart.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Average Amount of Non-Red Marbles\n\nWe'll iterate through each jar and compute the average amount of marbles that are not red.\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndata = {\n    \"jars\": [\n        {\n            \"jar_id\": 1,\n            \"marbles\": [\n                {\"color\": \"red\", \"amount\": 10},\n                {\"color\": \"blue\", \"amount\": 20},\n                {\"color\": \"green\", \"amount\": 15}\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"jar_id\": 2,\n            \"marbles\": [\n                {\"color\": \"red\", \"amount\": 5},\n                {\"color\": \"blue\", \"amount\": 30}\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"jar_id\": 3,\n            \"marbles\": [\n                {\"color\": \"red\", \"amount\": 15},\n                {\"color\": \"green\", \"amount\": 25}\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\ntotal_non_red = 0\ncount_non_red = 0\n\nfor jar in data[\"jars\"]:\n    for marble in jar[\"marbles\"]:\n        if marble[\"color\"] != \"red\":\n            total_non_red += marble[\"amount\"]\n            count_non_red += 1\n\naverage_non_red = total_non_red / count_non_red if count_non_red != 0 else 0\nprint(f\"Average amount of non-red marbles: {average_non_red}\")\n```\n\n### Step 2: Sort Jars Based on Blue Marbles\n\nWe will sort the jars based on the amount of blue marbles in descending order.\n\n```python\nsorted_jars = sorted(data[\"jars\"], key=lambda jar: next((m[\"amount\"] for m in jar[\"marbles\"] if m[\"color\"] == \"blue\"), 0), reverse=True)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Display a Bar Chart\n\nWe can use a library like `matplotlib` to display a bar chart.\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\njar_ids = [jar[\"jar_id\"] for jar in sorted_jars]\nblue_marbles = [next((m[\"amount\"] for m in jar[\"marbles\"] if m[\"color\"] == \"blue\"), 0) for jar in sorted_jars]\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.bar(jar_ids, blue_marbles, color='blue')\nplt.xlabel('Jar ID')\nplt.ylabel('Amount of Blue Marbles')\nplt.title('Jars sorted by Blue Marbles')\nplt.xticks(jar_ids)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Summary\n\n- We've calculated the average amount of non-red marbles.\n- We've sorted the jars by the number of blue marbles in descending order.\n- We've displayed the sorted data in a bar chart using `matplotlib`.\n\nFeel free to execute this code in your environment to see the results!"
