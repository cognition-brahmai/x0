In PyCharm, attachment={} is highlighted in yellow and shows a warning that says \"Default arguments value is mutable\". The warning further explains that this inspection detects when a mutable value such as list or dictionary is used as a default value for an argument. It also mentions that default argument values are only evaluated once at function definition time, which means modifying the default value of the argument will affect all subsequent calls of the function. What does this warning mean and how can I resolve this issue?\n\nHere is the code I'm working with:\n\n```python\ndef put_object(self, parent_object, connection_name, **data):\n    ...\n\ndef put_wall_post(self, message, attachment={}, profile_id=\"me\"):\n    return self.put_object(profile_id, \"feed\", message=message, **attachment)\n```"

        "content": "The warning you're seeing in PyCharm is related to the use of mutable default arguments in Python functions. This can lead to unexpected behavior because the default argument value is evaluated only once when the function is defined, not each time the function is called. This means that if you modify the default argument (in your case, `attachment`), it will retain its changes across subsequent calls to the function, which can lead to bugs that are hard to track down.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation and a solution:\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Mutable Default Argument:** In Python, mutable objects include lists, dictionaries, sets, etc. When you use a mutable object as a default argument, all calls to the function share the same instance of that object.\n- **Evaluation at Definition Time:** The default argument is evaluated at the time the function is defined, not each time the function is called. Therefore, if you modify the object, the modification persists across future calls.\n\n### Example of the Problem\n\n```python\ndef put_wall_post(self, message, attachment={}):\n    attachment['new_key'] = 'new_value'\n    print(attachment)\n\nput_wall_post('Hello')\n# Output: {'new_key': 'new_value'}\n\nput_wall_post('World')\n# Output: {'new_key': 'new_value', 'new_key': 'new_value'}\n```\n\nIn the example above, the dictionary `attachment` retains its modifications between calls, which can lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n### Solution\n\nTo avoid this issue, use `None` as the default value and then initialize the mutable object inside the function if needed:\n\n```python\ndef put_wall_post(self, message, attachment=None, profile_id=\"me\"):\n    if attachment is None:\n        attachment = {}\n    return self.put_object(profile_id, \"feed\", message=message, **attachment)\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n- Use `None` as the default value for function arguments that are meant to be mutable objects.\n- Initialize the mutable object within the function if the argument is `None`.\n- This approach ensures that each call to the function gets a fresh, independent instance of the mutable object, preventing unintended side effects."
