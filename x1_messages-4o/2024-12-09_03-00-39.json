        "content": "To achieve the SQL-like operations `GROUP BY ... COUNT` and `GROUP BY ... SUM` using Django ORM on your `Books` model, you can use the `annotate()` function along with `Count` and `Sum` from `django.db.models`. Here's how you can perform each of these queries:\n\n1. **`GROUP BY ... COUNT`**: To count the number of books by each author, you can use the `annotate()` function with `Count`.\n\n```python\nfrom django.db.models import Count\nfrom myapp.models import Books\n\n# Query to get count of books by each author\nauthor_counts = Books.objects.values('author').annotate(count=Count('author'))\n\n# Example output:\n# [{'author': 'Author 1', 'count': 5}, {'author': 'Author 2', 'count': 3}, ...]\n```\n\n2. **`GROUP BY ... SUM`**: To sum the prices of books by each author, use the `annotate()` function with `Sum`.\n\n```python\nfrom django.db.models import Sum\nfrom myapp.models import Books\n\n# Query to get total price of books by each author\nauthor_total_prices = Books.objects.values('author').annotate(total_price=Sum('price'))\n\n# Example output:\n# [{'author': 'Author 1', 'total_price': 150.0}, {'author': 'Author 2', 'total_price': 90.5}, ...]\n```\n\nIn both cases, `values('author')` is used to group the results by the `author` field, and `annotate()` is used to apply the aggregation function (`Count` or `Sum`) on the grouped data.\n\nThese queries will give you a list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains an `author` and either the `count` of books or the `total_price` of books for that author. Adjust the `myapp.models` import according to your actual app name."
