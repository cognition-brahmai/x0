Here's what I've tried: \n\nIn my setup.py, I have:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nfrom distutils.core import setup\nfrom distutils.extension import Extension\nfrom Cython.Distutils import build_ext\n\nfoo = Extension(name='foo.__init__', sources=['foo/__init__.pyx'])\nbar = Extension(name='foo.bar', sources=['foo/bar.pyx'])\n\nsetup(name='foo',\n      packages = ['foo'],\n      cmdclass={'build_ext':build_ext},\n      ext_modules = [foo, bar])\n```\n\nIn my foo/__init__.pyx, I have:\n\n```python\nimport foo.bar\n\ncpdef hello_world():\n    print \"hello world\"\n    foo.bar.blah()\n```\n\nIn my foo/bar.pyx, I have:\n\n```python\ncpdef blah():\n    print \"blah\"\n```\n\nBut when I try to run it, I get the following traceback:\n\n```shell\n$ python -c 'import foo; foo.hello_world()'\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\nImportError: No module named foo\n```\n\nI've also checked Python issue #15576 which was fixed by a specific Hg commit. On further investigation, I found that the mentioned commit is reachable from the Python v2.7.5 tag. Could this be a regression?"

        "content": "When dealing with Python packages that include Cython-compiled modules, especially when using an `__init__.pyx` file, there are a few key considerations to ensure everything works correctly. Let\u2019s go through some possible issues and solutions:\n\n1. **Module Import Path**: Ensure that the compiled modules are on the Python path. When you run your Python script, make sure the current working directory is correct or the package is installed in a location where Python can find it.\n\n2. **Build the Package**: Make sure you are actually building and installing the package correctly. After running `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`, ensure that a `foo` directory is created, which contains the `__init__.so` and `bar.so` files.\n\n3. **Cython Version**: Ensure you are using a compatible version of Cython. Sometimes, incompatibilities with Python 2.7 can cause issues.\n\n4. **Package Structure**: Verify that your directory structure is correct. You should have a directory structure like this:\n\n   ```\n   your_project/\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 setup.py\n   \u2514\u2500\u2500 foo/\n       \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.pyx\n       \u2514\u2500\u2500 bar.pyx\n   ```\n\n5. **Check for .pyc Files**: Sometimes, old `.pyc` files can interfere with imports. Make sure there are no lingering `.pyc` files that could be causing issues.\n\n6. **Setup Script Adjustments**: Make sure your setup script includes the `package_dir` argument if needed. Also, ensure that `ext_modules` includes all necessary extensions:\n\n   ```python\n   from distutils.core import setup\n   from distutils.extension import Extension\n   from Cython.Distutils import build_ext\n\n   foo_init = Extension(name='foo.__init__', sources=['foo/__init__.pyx'])\n   foo_bar = Extension(name='foo.bar', sources=['foo/bar.pyx'])\n\n   setup(\n       name='foo',\n       packages=['foo'],\n       package_dir={'foo': 'foo'},\n       cmdclass={'build_ext': build_ext},\n       ext_modules=[foo_init, foo_bar]\n   )\n   ```\n\n7. **Use of `__init__.pyx`**: Ensure that Cython is correctly compiling `__init__.pyx` to `__init__.so`. You might want to try renaming `__init__.pyx` to another name (e.g., `core.pyx`) and see if the problem persists. Then, in a regular `__init__.py`, you can import the compiled module.\n\n8. **Check for Python Bugs/Updates**: If you suspect a regression or bug in Python itself, consider trying your setup with another minor version of Python 2.7 (e.g., 2.7.18, the final release of Python 2.7).\n\nIf you've checked all these points and the issue persists, try simplifying your setup to isolate the problem. For example, start by getting just one module to work, and then gradually add complexity. This can help identify where things are going wrong."
