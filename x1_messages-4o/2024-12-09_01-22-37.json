I am trying to run a code that imports matplotlib.pyplot and torch, creates a tensor using torch, converts it to numpy array and plots it. However, I get an error message saying \"The kernel appears to have died. It will restart automatically.\" and a \"Dead kernel\" tag. If I import matplotlib.pyplot and plot a random graph before the rest of my code, it works fine. I'm using numpy 1.18.5, pytorch 1.6.0, matplotlib 3.2.2 on Python 3.7.7. \n\n```python\n# Code that results in error \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport torch\n\nx = y = torch.tensor([1,2,3]).numpy()\nplt.plot(x,y)\n\n# Code that works fine \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\nplt.subplots(figsize=(0.01,0.01))\nplt.gca().set_visible(False)\n\nimport torch\nx = torch.tensor([1,2,3]).numpy()\nplt.plot(x,x)\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with the kernel dying when plotting after importing the `torch` library might be related to a few different things, including compatibility issues or conflicts between the versions of libraries you are using. Here are some steps and tips to help debug and potentially resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Compatibility**: Ensure that the versions of PyTorch, NumPy, and Matplotlib are compatible with each other. Sometimes, specific versions might not work well together. Consider upgrading to more recent versions if possible or checking the compatibility notes for each library.\n\n2. **Environment Isolation**: Make sure you are using a virtual environment (like `conda` or `venv`) to isolate your dependencies. This can prevent conflicts with other packages or versions that might be installed globally.\n\n3. **GPU vs CPU**: If you have a GPU-enabled version of PyTorch installed, there might be issues related to CUDA. Check if you have the necessary CUDA toolkit installed, or try using a CPU-only version of PyTorch to see if the problem persists.\n\n4. **Resource Constraints**: Ensure that your system has enough resources. Sometimes, plotting or loading large datasets can cause the kernel to crash due to memory constraints.\n\n5. **Backend Issues**: Matplotlib can use different backends for rendering. You might want to try specifying a different backend. You can do this by adding the following line before importing `matplotlib.pyplot`:\n\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib\n   matplotlib.use('Agg')  # Or try 'TkAgg', 'Qt5Agg', etc.\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n   ```\n\n6. **Check for Errors**: Sometimes the Jupyter Notebook might not show the full error message when the kernel dies. Try running your script in a terminal or a different environment to see if you get a more detailed error message.\n\n7. **Debugging Steps**: Simplify your code to the minimal version that still causes the issue and incrementally add components back. This might help identify the exact line or operation causing the crash.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve your issue, consider checking the forums for each library for known issues, or try reaching out with specific error messages you encounter when running the script outside of Jupyter."
