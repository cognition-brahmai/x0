I understand that the log(n) comes from the average height of the tree after splitting, and that at each split, one must look at each feature (m) and choose the best one to split on. This is done by calculating a \"best metric\" (in my case, a gini impurity) for each sample at that node (n). However, to find the best split, wouldn't it require looking at each possible way to split the samples for each feature? Shouldn't that be something like 2^n-1 * m rather than just mn?"

        "content": "The runtime complexity for constructing a binary decision tree, as stated as \\(O(mn \\log n)\\), is an approximation based on certain assumptions and optimizations used in practice, particularly in libraries like scikit-learn. Let's break this down:\n\n1. **Tree Height**: The \\(\\log n\\) term comes from the average height of a balanced binary tree. In practice, decision trees don't always end up perfectly balanced, but using \\(\\log n\\) is a reasonable approximation for average cases, especially when discussing complexity.\n\n2. **Feature Evaluation**: For each node, you evaluate each of the \\(m\\) features to determine the best feature to split on. That accounts for the \\(m\\) term in the complexity.\n\n3. **Sample Evaluation**: For each feature, you have to evaluate the possible splits. In the most straightforward approach, you might consider all possible ways to partition the samples. However, decision tree algorithms like CART (Classification and Regression Trees), which scikit-learn uses, employ more efficient strategies rather than checking all \\(2^n - 1\\) possible splits. \n\n    - **Sorted Splits**: For continuous features, you typically sort the feature values once, which is \\(O(n \\log n)\\), and then consider splits between consecutive sorted values, which is \\(O(n)\\).\n\n    - **Binary Decisions**: For categorical features, scikit-learn handles them by considering less complex splits when possible.\n\n4. **Practical Complexity**: The theoretical worst-case complexity of considering all possible splits is indeed very high, but practical implementations use heuristic methods to reduce this. By sorting the samples once per feature and evaluating splits in linear time relative to the number of samples, the complexity becomes more manageable.\n\nThus, while the theoretical exploration of all possible subsets would result in much higher complexity, practical implementations use efficient techniques to reduce this to \\(O(mn \\log n)\\). This is why the complexity is often stated in this way, reflecting an efficient balance between theoretical worst-case and practical average-case scenarios."
