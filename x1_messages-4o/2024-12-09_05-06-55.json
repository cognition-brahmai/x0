        "content": "To ensure that your Python program is halted when an exception is raised, you can let the exception propagate naturally without catching it, which will cause the program to terminate. However, if you want to catch the exception and still terminate the program, you can do so by using a try-except block and then explicitly calling `sys.exit()` in the except block. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Without catching the exception:**\n   Simply write your code without any try-except block, and if an exception occurs, Python will print a traceback and terminate the program.\n\n   ```python\n   # Example without try-except\n   def divide(a, b):\n       return a / b\n\n   result = divide(10, 0)  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError\n   print(result)\n   ```\n\n2. **With a try-except block and `sys.exit()`:**\n   If you want to catch the exception to perform some cleanup or log an error message before terminating the program, you can use `sys.exit()`.\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n\n   try:\n       # Code that may raise an exception\n       def divide(a, b):\n           return a / b\n\n       result = divide(10, 0)  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError\n       print(result)\n\n   except Exception as e:\n       print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n       sys.exit(1)  # Exit the program with a non-zero exit code\n   ```\n\nIn this example, if a `ZeroDivisionError` or any other exception occurs, it will be caught in the except block, a message will be printed, and then `sys.exit()` will terminate the program with a status code of `1`, indicating that the program terminated due to an error. You can replace `1` with any other non-zero integer to indicate different types of errors if needed."
