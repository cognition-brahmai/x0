By using `global`, you inform Python that you intend to use the variable as a global variable, allowing it to be accessed and modified outside of the function. Here's an example to illustrate this:\n\n```python\ndef my_function():\n    global my_variable\n    my_variable = 10  # Declare and initialize a global variable\n\nmy_function()\nprint(my_variable)  # This will print 10\n```\n\nIn this example, `my_variable` is declared within `my_function()` as a global variable. As a result, it can be accessed outside of the function, and the print statement will output `10`."
