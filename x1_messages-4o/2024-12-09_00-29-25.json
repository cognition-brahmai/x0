However, I'm having difficulty extracting certain metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value from the output. By default, only accuracy and Cohen kappa are printed. I tried passing confusionMatrix as a summary function, but I'm getting an error. How can I extract additional metrics like sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value from the caret train object in R?\n\nHere is the code I'm using:\n\n```R\nctrl <- trainControl(method = \"repeatedcv\", number = 10, repeats = 10, \n                     savePredictions = TRUE)\n\nmod_fit <- train(Y ~ .,  data=df, method=\"glm\", family=\"binomial\",\n                 trControl = ctrl)\n\nprint(mod_fit)\n\nctrl <- trainControl(method = \"repeatedcv\", number = 10, repeats = 10, \n                     savePredictions = TRUE, summaryFunction = confusionMatrix)\n\nmod_fit <- train(Y ~ .,  data=df, method=\"glm\", family=\"binomial\",\n                 trControl = ctrl)\n\nError: `data` and `reference` should be factors with the same levels. \n13.\nstop(\"`data` and `reference` should be factors with the same levels.\", \n    call. = FALSE) \n12.\nconfusionMatrix.default(testOutput, lev, method) \n11.\nctrl$summaryFunction(testOutput, lev, method) \n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `confusionMatrix` requires both `data` and `reference` to be factors with the same levels. In your use of the `caret` package, the `summaryFunction` should be appropriately defined to handle the predictions and the true labels.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to extract sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value:\n\n1. Define a custom summary function that calculates these metrics.\n\n2. Use this function in your `trainControl`.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```r\nlibrary(caret)\n\n# Define a custom summary function\ncustom_summary <- function(data, lev = NULL, model = NULL) {\n  # Calculate confusion matrix\n  cm <- confusionMatrix(data$pred, data$obs, positive = lev[1])\n  \n  # Extract metrics\n  sensitivity <- cm$byClass[\"Sensitivity\"]\n  specificity <- cm$byClass[\"Specificity\"]\n  ppv <- cm$byClass[\"Pos Pred Value\"]  # Positive Predictive Value\n  \n  # Return a named vector of metrics\n  out <- c(Sensitivity = sensitivity, Specificity = specificity, PPV = ppv)\n  return(out)\n}\n\n# Set up trainControl with the custom summary function\nctrl <- trainControl(method = \"repeatedcv\", number = 10, repeats = 10, \n                     savePredictions = TRUE, classProbs = TRUE, \n                     summaryFunction = custom_summary)\n\n# Train the model\nmod_fit <- train(Y ~ ., data = df, method = \"glm\", family = \"binomial\",\n                 trControl = ctrl)\n\n# Print the model results\nprint(mod_fit)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Custom Summary Function**: `custom_summary` is defined to compute sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value using the `confusionMatrix` function.\n- **Class Probs**: The `classProbs = TRUE` argument is included in `trainControl` to ensure that probabilities are calculated, which is often required for binary classification metrics.\n- **Positive Class**: Ensure that the `positive` class is correctly specified in the `confusionMatrix` function. Here, `lev[1]` is used assuming that the first level is the positive class. You can adjust it if your positive class is different.\n\nBy using this setup, you should be able to extract the desired metrics from your logistic regression model."
