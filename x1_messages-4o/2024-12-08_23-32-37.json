        "content": "To modify the query to include only data from the top 10% of stores by sales volume, you'll need to make a few adjustments. The key part is to ensure that you're selecting the top 10% of stores based on their total sales volume from the dataset. Here's the modified query:\n\n```sql\nWITH top_stores AS (\n  SELECT store_id\n  FROM organic_food_sales\n  GROUP BY store_id\n  HAVING SUM(sales_last_year) >= (\n    SELECT PERCENTILE_CONT(0.9) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY SUM(sales_last_year) DESC)\n    FROM organic_food_sales\n  )\n)\n\nSELECT \n  (SUM(sales_last_year) - SUM(sales_five_years_ago)) / SUM(sales_five_years_ago) * 100 AS percent_change\nFROM \n  organic_food_sales\nWHERE \n  year IN (CURRENT_YEAR, CURRENT_YEAR-1, CURRENT_YEAR-2, CURRENT_YEAR-3, CURRENT_YEAR-4)\n  AND store_id IN (SELECT store_id FROM top_stores);\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **CTE (Common Table Expression):** The `top_stores` CTE calculates which stores fall into the top 10% based on sales volume using the `PERCENTILE_CONT` function.\n- **Main Query:** The main query calculates the percentage change in sales for these top-performing stores over the past five years.\n- **Filtering:** `store_id IN (SELECT store_id FROM top_stores)` ensures only the sales data from the top 10% of stores is considered.\n\nMake sure to replace `CURRENT_YEAR` with the actual current year value or dynamically handle it depending on your database system capabilities. Additionally, ensure that your database system supports the `PERCENTILE_CONT` function, as this feature might vary across different SQL database systems."
