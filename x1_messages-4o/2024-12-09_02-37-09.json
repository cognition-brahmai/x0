        "content": "In Python, when overriding methods of a parent class, what is the best practice - should I explicitly list given parameters or use a blanket `*args, **kwargs` construct? Is one method better than the other? What are the advantages and disadvantages I might be overlooking? Here is an example of the two methods I am considering:\n\n```python\nclass Parent(object):\n\n    def save(self, commit=True):\n        # ...\n\nclass Explicit(Parent):\n\n    def save(self, commit=True):\n        super(Explicit, self).save(commit=commit)\n        # more logic\n\nclass Blanket(Parent):\n\n    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super(Blanket, self).save(*args, **kwargs)\n        # more logic\n```\n\nFrom my understanding, the explicit variant is more explicit (as per Zen of Python), easier to grasp, and the function parameters are easily accessed. Conversely, the blanket variant seems more DRY, makes the parent class easily interchangeable, and the change of default values in the parent method is propagated without needing to touch other code."

        "content": "Your understanding aligns well with the typical considerations when deciding between explicit parameters and using `*args` and `**kwargs` in method overriding. Let's break down the advantages and disadvantages of each approach to help you make an informed decision.\n\n### Explicit Parameters\n\n**Advantages:**\n1. **Clarity and Readability:** Explicitly listing parameters makes the method signature clear and easy to understand. This aligns with the Zen of Python's principle: \"Explicit is better than implicit.\"\n2. **Code Inspection:** Tools and IDEs can better support code inspection, autocompletion, and static analysis when parameters are explicitly defined.\n3. **Documentation:** Explicit parameters make it easier to generate and maintain accurate documentation.\n4. **Error Checking:** It's easier to catch errors related to parameter mismatches or missing arguments.\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n1. **Maintenance Overhead:** If the parent class changes its method signature, you need to update the child class method signatures accordingly, which can be cumbersome in large codebases.\n2. **Less Flexibility:** It ties the child class closely to the parent class's method signature, which might reduce flexibility if the parent's API changes frequently.\n\n### Blanket `*args` and `**kwargs`\n\n**Advantages:**\n1. **Flexibility and Extensibility:** This approach is more flexible, allowing the method to handle any future changes in the parent method\u2019s signature without modification.\n2. **DRY Principle:** Reduces redundancy by not having to repeat parameter declarations, assuming changes in the parent class.\n3. **Interchangeability:** Makes it easier to swap out parent classes or refactor inheritance hierarchies without needing to adjust parameter lists.\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n1. **Reduced Clarity:** The method signature becomes less clear, as it does not explicitly specify which parameters are expected.\n2. **Potential for Hidden Bugs:** It may be harder to track down errors related to incorrect or unexpected arguments being passed, as they are not explicitly declared.\n3. **Documentation Challenges:** With non-explicit parameters, it can be more challenging to provide clear and specific documentation for the method's expected inputs.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nChoosing between these approaches depends on the specific needs of your project:\n\n- If the parent method's signature is stable and unlikely to change, and clarity is a priority, prefer explicit parameters.\n- If you expect frequent changes to the parent class\u2019s method signature, or if you're working with a dynamic inheritance hierarchy, consider using `*args` and `**kwargs` for flexibility.\n\nIn many cases, a hybrid approach can also be effective: use explicit parameters for the most commonly used or critical arguments, and reserve `*args` and `**kwargs` for less critical or more volatile parts of the signature. This way, you get a balance of clarity and flexibility."
