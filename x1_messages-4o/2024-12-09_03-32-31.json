Specifically, I want to fill a std::vector with a range of values from a minimum to a maximum. I know I could possibly use std::generate_n and provide a functor to generate the sequence, but I'm wondering if there's a more succinct method using the STL. Here's an example of what I'm trying to replicate in C++:\n\n```python\n# Python\n>>> x = range(0, 10)\n>>> x\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n```"

        "content": "In C++, you can achieve similar functionality to Python's `range()` function using the Standard Template Library (STL). Specifically, you can utilize the combination of `std::vector`, `std::iota`, and `std::vector::reserve` to fill a vector with a range of values. Here's a succinct way to do this:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <numeric> // for std::iota\n\nint main() {\n    int min = 0;\n    int max = 10;\n\n    std::vector<int> vec(max - min);\n    std::iota(vec.begin(), vec.end(), min);\n\n    // Output the vector to verify\n    for (int value : vec) {\n        std::cout << value << \" \";\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`std::vector<int> vec(max - min);`**: This initializes a vector with the size of the range you want, which is `max - min`.\n- **`std::iota(vec.begin(), vec.end(), min);`**: This function fills the vector with sequentially increasing values starting from `min`. The first argument is the beginning of the vector, the second is the end, and the third is the starting value.\n\nThis approach is succinct and leverages the power of the STL to fill a vector with a range of values in an efficient and straightforward manner."
