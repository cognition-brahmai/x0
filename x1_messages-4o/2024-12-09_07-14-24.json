I have set both the global and local versions of Python to 3.8.1 using the Pyenv commands. When I create a new Python project with Poetry, the pyproject.toml file defaults to Python 2.7. I'm using MacOS, which comes with Python 2.7 bundled, and I think that might be the issue. I've reinstalled Python 3.8 with Pyenv, but when I try to install Poetry, it gives an error stating that the activated Python version 2.7.16 is not supported by the project. How can I make Poetry use the Python version that's installed with Pyenv?"

        "content": "To ensure that Poetry uses the Python version installed by Pyenv, you need to ensure that your environment is correctly set up to point to the Python version managed by Pyenv rather than the system's default Python version. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you configure your environment:\n\n1. **Verify Pyenv Installation:**\n   Make sure Pyenv is correctly installed and that the desired Python version is available. You can check the installed versions with:\n   ```sh\n   pyenv versions\n   ```\n\n2. **Set the Local Python Version:**\n   Navigate to your project directory and set the local Python version to 3.8.1 using:\n   ```sh\n   pyenv local 3.8.1\n   ```\n   This creates a `.python-version` file in your project directory, which tells Pyenv to use Python 3.8.1 for this project.\n\n3. **Configure Shell to Use Pyenv's Python:**\n   Ensure your shell configuration is set up to use Pyenv. Add the following lines to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.):\n   ```sh\n   export PATH=\"$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH\"\n   eval \"$(pyenv init --path)\"\n   eval \"$(pyenv init -)\"\n   ```\n   Then, restart your shell or run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc` to apply the changes.\n\n4. **Verify the Python Version:**\n   Once in your project directory, verify that the correct Python version is being used:\n   ```sh\n   python --version\n   ```\n   It should show Python 3.8.1 or the version you set with Pyenv.\n\n5. **Install Poetry with Pyenv\u2019s Python:**\n   Now, install Poetry using the Python version managed by Pyenv. First, deactivate any existing virtual environments by running `deactivate` if needed. Then, ensure you are using the correct Python version by checking again with `python --version`.\n\n6. **Install Poetry:**\n   Install Poetry using the Pyenv-managed Python:\n   ```sh\n   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python -\n   ```\n   This should install Poetry in your user environment.\n\n7. **Check Poetry's Python Interpreter:**\n   Confirm that Poetry uses the correct Python version by running:\n   ```sh\n   poetry env use $(pyenv which python)\n   ```\n   This explicitly tells Poetry to use the Python interpreter managed by Pyenv.\n\n8. **Create Your New Project:**\n   Now, you can create your new project with Poetry:\n   ```sh\n   poetry new my_project\n   cd my_project\n   poetry env use $(pyenv which python)\n   ```\n\n9. **Update pyproject.toml:**\n   If the Python version is still incorrect, manually edit the `pyproject.toml` file to specify the correct Python version:\n   ```toml\n   [tool.poetry.dependencies]\n   python = \"^3.8\"\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to configure your environment so that Poetry uses the Python version installed via Pyenv. This setup helps avoid any conflicts with the system's default Python installation."
