        "content": "The code you've provided should work correctly for both integers and floats, as long as the list contains the minimum value exactly as it appears in the list. The `ValueError` you are encountering may arise if there is a floating-point precision issue, causing the `min()` function to return a value that is slightly different than any of the actual values in the list due to how floating-point arithmetic operates in Python.\n\nTo handle this, you can use the `enumerate()` function along with a simple loop to find the index of the minimum value without relying on the `index()` method, thus avoiding precision issues. Here is an example:\n\n```python\nmyList = [0.13417985135, 0.2, 0.13417985134, 0.5]\n\n# Initialize variables to store the minimum value and its index\nmin_value = float('inf')\nmin_index = -1\n\n# Iterate over the list with both index and value\nfor index, value in enumerate(myList):\n    if value < min_value:\n        min_value = value\n        min_index = index\n\nprint(\"Index of the minimum value:\", min_index)\n```\n\nThis approach iterates over the list, comparing each value to find the smallest one, and keeps track of its index. This method is not only robust against floating-point precision issues but also works efficiently for any list of comparable items."
