However, when I try to run my code, I encounter a `TypeError: the JSON object must be str, not 'bytes'`. Here is my code:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\n\nurl = 'my url'\nuser = 'my user'\npwd = 'my password'\n\nresponse = requests.get(url, auth=(user, pwd))\n\nif(myResponse.ok):\n    Data = json.loads(myResponse.content)\n```\n\nI also tried using decode function to convert the response content to a string using `utf-8` encoding, but the same error persists:\n\n```python\njData = json.loads(myResponse.content).decode('utf-8')\n```\n\nWhat could be the problem and how can I solve it?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that `myResponse.content` returns a `bytes` object, and `json.loads()` expects a `str` object. It seems like you have a small mistake in your code. You should decode the `bytes` to `str` before passing it to `json.loads()`. Also, it looks like there might be a typo in your code where you're using `myResponse` instead of `response`. Here\u2019s how you can fix it:\n\n1. Ensure you are using the correct variable name (`response` instead of `myResponse`).\n2. Decode the content before loading it as JSON.\n\nHere's the corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\n\nurl = 'my url'\nuser = 'my user'\npwd = 'my password'\n\nresponse = requests.get(url, auth=(user, pwd))\n\nif response.ok:\n    # Decode response content from bytes to string\n    content_str = response.content.decode('utf-8')\n    \n    # Load the JSON data\n    data = json.loads(content_str)\n    print(data)\nelse:\n    print(f\"Request failed with status code: {response.status_code}\")\n```\n\nAdditionally, you can simplify the process by directly using `response.json()` which handles the decoding and parsing for you:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\nurl = 'my url'\nuser = 'my user'\npwd = 'my password'\n\nresponse = requests.get(url, auth=(user, pwd))\n\nif response.ok:\n    data = response.json()  # Automatically decodes and parses JSON\n    print(data)\nelse:\n    print(f\"Request failed with status code: {response.status_code}\")\n```\n\nBoth these approaches should resolve the `TypeError` you're encountering."
