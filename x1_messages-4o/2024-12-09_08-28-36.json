Here is the code I am trying to run:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\nfrom multiprocessing import Pool\np = Pool(1)\ndef f(x):\n    return x*x\np.map(f, [1, 2, 3])\n```\n\nAnd here is the error I get:\n\n```bash\n> python example.py\nProcess PoolWorker-1:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.6/multiprocessing/process.py\", line 231, in _bootstrap\n    self.run()\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.6/multiprocessing/process.py\", line 88, in run\n    self._target(*self._args, **self._kwargs)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.6/multiprocessing/pool.py\", line 57, in worker\n    task = get()\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.6/multiprocessing/queues.py\", line 339, in get\n    return recv()\nAttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'f'\n```\n\nCould you please help me understand what's going wrong here?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to the way the `multiprocessing` module works in Python, especially in older versions like 2.6. When using the `Pool` class, the function you want to map, in this case `f`, needs to be accessible by the worker processes. This means it should be defined at the top level of the module, not inside any conditional blocks or under any functions.\n\nIn your script, the function `f` is defined at the top level, which is correct. However, the issue might stem from the way the script is being executed or some environment-specific problem. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this:\n\n1. **Use `if __name__ == '__main__':`**: This is a common pattern in Python scripts that use `multiprocessing`, especially on Windows, to ensure that the script is executed correctly. Even though you're on Linux, it's a good practice to follow:\n\n    ```python\n    #!/usr/bin/python\n    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n    from multiprocessing import Pool\n\n    def f(x):\n        return x*x\n\n    if __name__ == '__main__':\n        p = Pool(1)\n        result = p.map(f, [1, 2, 3])\n        print(result)\n    ```\n\n2. **Check Python Version**: Python 2.6 is quite old and may have bugs or lack support for some features in the `multiprocessing` module. If possible, consider upgrading to a newer version of Python, such as Python 2.7 or, ideally, Python 3.x, where `multiprocessing` has more robust support.\n\n3. **Environment Variables**: Ensure that there are no environment variables or settings in your shell that might affect the behavior of the Python script.\n\n4. **File Naming**: Ensure that your script file is not named `multiprocessing.py`, as this could cause conflicts with the module import.\n\n5. **Isolate the Issue**: Try running a minimal version of your script to see if the problem persists:\n\n    ```python\n    #!/usr/bin/python\n    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n    from multiprocessing import Pool\n\n    def f(x):\n        return x*x\n\n    if __name__ == '__main__':\n        with Pool(1) as p:\n            print(p.map(f, [1, 2, 3]))\n    ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `AttributeError`. Let me know if the problem persists or if there's anything else I can assist you with!"
