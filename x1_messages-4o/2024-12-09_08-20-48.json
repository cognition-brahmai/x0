However, when I run the code from IDLE/PyScripter, I only get the time. How can I get the full line-by-line profile over the code I execute? I have never used any advanced Python features like decorators, so I am struggling to understand how to use the guidelines provided.\n\nHere is the code I have tried:\n```python\nfrom line_profiler import LineProfiler\n\ndef do_stuff(numbers):\n    print numbers\n\nnumbers = 2\nprofile = LineProfiler(do_stuff(numbers))\nprofile.print_stats()\n```\nAnd this is the output I get:\n```python\nTimer unit: 4.17188e-10 s\n```"

        "content": "To perform line-by-line profiling of a Python function using the `line_profiler` module, you'll want to use it in a slightly different way than what you've currently implemented. The key aspect of using `line_profiler` is to apply it as a decorator to the function you want to profile and to ensure you're using it properly to collect and display the profiling statistics.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to get a line-by-line profile:\n\n```python\nfrom line_profiler import LineProfiler\n\n# Define the function to be profiled\ndef do_stuff(numbers):\n    for i in range(numbers):\n        print(i)\n\n# Create a LineProfiler instance\nprofile = LineProfiler()\n\n# Decorate the function with the profiler\nprofile.add_function(do_stuff)\n\n# Run the function under the profiler\nprofile.run('do_stuff(5)')\n\n# Print the results\nprofile.print_stats()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Define the Function**: You've defined a function `do_stuff` that takes an argument `numbers`.\n\n2. **Create a LineProfiler Instance**: You create an instance of `LineProfiler`.\n\n3. **Add Function to Profiler**: Instead of directly calling the function, you add the function to the profiler using `profile.add_function(do_stuff)`. This tells the profiler that this is the function you want to profile.\n\n4. **Run the Function with Profiler**: Use `profile.run('do_stuff(5)')` to execute the function within the profiler's context. This way, the profiler tracks the execution of each line within the function.\n\n5. **Print the Profiling Stats**: Finally, call `profile.print_stats()` to display the line-by-line profiling results.\n\nYou should run this script from the command line or a Python environment that supports command-line execution, as some IDEs like IDLE or PyScripter might not display the profiling output properly.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to see detailed timing information for each line of code in your `do_stuff` function, which will help you understand which parts of your code are taking the most time."
