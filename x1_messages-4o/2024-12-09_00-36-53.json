I am trying to write an array (or list) to a text file, but it seems to write the entire list in one operation rather than putting each element on a new line. Here is the current code I have:\n\n```python\ndef save_to_file(*text):\n    with open('/path/to/filename.txt', mode='wt', encoding='utf-8') as myfile:\n        for lines in text:\n            print(lines, file = myfile)\n    myfile.close\n```\n\nWhen I run this, it outputs something like this:\n\n```python\n['element1', 'element2', 'element3']\nusername@machine:/path$\n```\n\nHowever, I would like to have each element on a new line, like so:\n\n```python\nelement1\nelement2\nelement3\nusername@machine:/path$\n```\n\nI tried modifying the code as follows but it resulted in a \"TypeError: must be str, not list\" error:\n\n```python\ndef save_to_file(*text):\n    myfile = open('/path/to/filename.txt', mode='wt', encoding='utf-8')\n    for lines in text:\n        myfile.write(lines)\n    myfile.close\n```\n\nHow can I modify my code to write each element of the list on a new line?"

        "content": "To write each element of a list to a file with each element on a new line, you need to iterate over the list and write each element individually. The issue you're encountering is because you're passing a list to the `write` function, which expects a string. Here's how you can modify your function to achieve the desired output:\n\n```python\ndef save_to_file(text):\n    with open('/path/to/filename.txt', mode='wt', encoding='utf-8') as myfile:\n        for line in text:\n            myfile.write(line + '\\n')  # Add a newline character after each element\n\n# Example usage\nmy_list = ['element1', 'element2', 'element3']\nsave_to_file(my_list)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Iterate Over the List**: Loop through each element in the list `text`.\n\n2. **Write Each Element**: Use `myfile.write()` to write each element to the file, appending `'\\n'` to ensure each element is on a new line.\n\n3. **Use Context Manager**: The `with open(...) as myfile:` syntax automatically handles closing the file, ensuring resources are properly managed.\n\nThis should give you the output where each element of the list is written on a new line in the file."
