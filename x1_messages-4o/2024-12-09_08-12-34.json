In the development environment (SDK), it usually starts with the string \"Development\". In the production environment, it typically contains a version string starting with \"Google App Engine\".\n\nBy using this check, you can conditionally execute code differently based on whether you're in the development or production environment, allowing you to tailor your application's behavior accordingly."
