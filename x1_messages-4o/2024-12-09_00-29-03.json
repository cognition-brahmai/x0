However, I'm unable to terminate the script using Ctrl+C. I've also tried using a system signal handler but it didn't work. When I attempt to terminate it using Ctrl+C, it's being ignored. How can I terminate this script successfully?\n\nHere's my script:\n\n```\nimport threading\n\nclass FirstThread (threading.Thread):\n    def run (self):\n        while True:\n            print 'first'\n\nclass SecondThread (threading.Thread):\n    def run (self):\n        while True:\n            print 'second'\n\nFirstThread().start()\nSecondThread().start()\n```\n\nThis is the signal handler I tried:\n\n```\nimport signal \nimport sys\ndef signal_handler(signal, frame):\n    sys.exit(0)\nsignal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)\n```\n\nI'm currently killing the process by its PID after sending the program to the background with Ctrl+Z, which isn't being ignored. Why is Ctrl+C being ignored so persistently?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is related to how the Python threading module interacts with signal handling. In Python, signals are only received by the main thread. This means that if your main thread is not actively running (e.g., it's blocked or waiting), it won't handle the signals like `SIGINT` (triggered by Ctrl+C).\n\nIn your script, the main thread finishes execution right after starting the two threads, leaving no opportunity to handle the signal. To fix this, you can make the main thread wait for the child threads to finish, using a loop to keep it running, or use `join()` to wait for threads.\n\nHere's a way to modify your script to allow for graceful termination with Ctrl+C:\n\n```python\nimport threading\nimport signal\nimport sys\n\nclass FirstThread(threading.Thread):\n    def run(self):\n        while True:\n            print 'first'\n\nclass SecondThread(threading.Thread):\n    def run(self):\n        while True:\n            print 'second'\n\ndef signal_handler(signal, frame):\n    print(\"Exiting...\")\n    sys.exit(0)\n\n# Register the signal handler\nsignal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)\n\n# Start threads\nfirst_thread = FirstThread()\nsecond_thread = SecondThread()\n\nfirst_thread.start()\nsecond_thread.start()\n\n# Keep the main thread alive, using join to wait for threads\ntry:\n    first_thread.join()\n    second_thread.join()\nexcept KeyboardInterrupt:\n    print(\"Interrupted by user. Exiting...\")\n    sys.exit(0)\n```\n\nIn this version, the main thread waits for the completion of the child threads using `join()`. When you press Ctrl+C, the `signal_handler` function is invoked, which in turn calls `sys.exit(0)`, terminating the program. Also, I've added a try-except block to handle `KeyboardInterrupt` for additional graceful shutdown."
