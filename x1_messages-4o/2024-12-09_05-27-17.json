For example, I want to pass the tuple (1,2,3,4) as --data (1,2,3,4), but it is received as the string '(1,2,3,4)'. I have tried setting type=tuple for argparse.add_argument, but it didn't work. Should I add a new type class to the type argument of add_argument? Additionally, when I used ast.literal_eval based on some suggestions, I got spaces in my result as follows:\n\n(1,2,3,4)\n<type 'str'>\n(1, 2, 3, 4)\n<type 'tuple'>\n\nHow can I fix these issues?"

        "content": "To pass a tuple as a command line argument using the `argparse` module in Python and have it correctly parsed as a tuple, you can indeed use `ast.literal_eval` to convert the string representation of a tuple into an actual tuple. The spaces you see in the output are normal for how tuples are printed in Python. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. Use `ast.literal_eval` to safely evaluate the string input as a Python expression.\n2. Define a custom type function for `argparse` that uses `ast.literal_eval`.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport argparse\nimport ast\n\ndef parse_tuple(argument):\n    try:\n        # Use ast.literal_eval to evaluate the string as a Python expression\n        result = ast.literal_eval(argument)\n        # Check if the result is a tuple\n        if isinstance(result, tuple):\n            return result\n        else:\n            raise ValueError\n    except (ValueError, SyntaxError):\n        raise argparse.ArgumentTypeError(\"Argument must be a tuple, e.g., (1,2,3,4)\")\n\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=\"Process some tuples.\")\nparser.add_argument('--data', type=parse_tuple, help=\"Input tuple, e.g., (1,2,3,4)\")\n\nargs = parser.parse_args()\n\nprint(args.data)\nprint(type(args.data))\n```\n\n### How it works:\n- `parse_tuple` is a function that tries to convert the input string to a tuple using `ast.literal_eval`.\n- If the conversion is successful and the result is a tuple, it returns the tuple.\n- If not, it raises an `ArgumentTypeError`, which is a way to handle errors in `argparse`.\n\n### Running the script:\nYou would run your script from the command line like this:\n\n```bash\npython script_name.py --data \"(1,2,3,4)\"\n```\n\nMake sure to include the quotes around the tuple when passing it as a command line argument to ensure it is interpreted as a single string.\n\nThis approach ensures that the input is safely evaluated and converted into a tuple, and it provides a clear error message if the input is not in the correct format."
