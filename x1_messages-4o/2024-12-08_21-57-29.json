Can you provide an example of a Go program that implements the formula for significance, which is (Importance + Uniqueness + Proximity + Consequence) / 4? \nFor instance, let's say we have a passage about a recent merger between two companies. One sentence reads: \"Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company announced their merger with United States Rubber in 1936, forming the first conglomerate based on rubber in the United States.\" \nHow can I apply the formula to this passage to identify the most significant event? Can you show me how to use Go code to assign values to Importance, Uniqueness, Proximity, and Consequence, and then compute the significance score?"

        "content": "To calculate the significance of events in a passage using Go, you can implement a simple program that assigns values to the parameters: Importance, Uniqueness, Proximity, and Consequence. Then, it computes the significance score using the given formula.\n\nHere's a basic Go program that demonstrates how you might implement this:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n)\n\n// Event represents an event with its attributes\ntype Event struct {\n\tDescription string\n\tImportance  float64\n\tUniqueness  float64\n\tProximity   float64\n\tConsequence float64\n}\n\n// Significance calculates the significance score of the event\nfunc (e Event) Significance() float64 {\n\treturn (e.Importance + e.Uniqueness + e.Proximity + e.Consequence) / 4\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Define the event from the passage\n\tevent := Event{\n\t\tDescription: \"Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company announced their merger with United States Rubber in 1936, forming the first conglomerate based on rubber in the United States.\",\n\t\tImportance:  8.0, // Example value: How crucial is this event in the context?\n\t\tUniqueness:  7.0, // Example value: How unique or rare is this occurrence?\n\t\tProximity:   6.0, // Example value: How recently or closely related is this to the current context?\n\t\tConsequence: 9.0, // Example value: What is the impact or consequence of this event?\n\t}\n\n\t// Calculate the significance score\n\tsignificanceScore := event.Significance()\n\n\t// Output the result\n\tfmt.Printf(\"The significance score of the event is: %.2f\\n\", significanceScore)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Event Structure**: The `Event` struct holds the description and the four attributes of an event (Importance, Uniqueness, Proximity, and Consequence).\n\n2. **Significance Method**: The `Significance` method calculates the average of the four attributes to determine the event's significance.\n\n3. **Main Function**: In the `main` function, you define an example event with example attribute values. You then calculate and print the significance score based on these values.\n\n### Assigning Values:\n\n- **Importance**: You might assign a higher value if the event is crucial to the narrative or context.\n- **Uniqueness**: Assign a higher value if the event is rare or unprecedented.\n- **Proximity**: A higher value if the event is recent or directly related to the focus of the passage.\n- **Consequence**: A higher value if the event has significant effects or implications.\n\nYou can adjust the values based on your analysis of the passage and the context in which the event occurs."
