However, when I try to run this method in a Python shell, I encounter an AttributeError stating 'method_descriptor' object has no attribute 'today'. The error specifically occurs when I run 'p.was_published_today()'. Here's the code for my model:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nclass Poll(models.Model):\n    question = models.CharField(max_length=200)\n    pub_date = models.DateTimeField('date published')\n    def __unicode__(self):\n        return self.question\n    def was_published_today(self):\n        return self.pub_date.date() == datetime.date.today()\n```\n\nAnd here is how I am trying to run the method in the Python shell:\n\n```python\np = Poll.objects.get(pk=1)\np.was_published_today()\n```\n\nThe 'p = Poll.objects.get(pk=1)' statement is executed without any issues but the 'p.was_published_today()' statement is causing the aforementioned error. How can I resolve this error?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to a small mistake in how you're using the `datetime` module. Specifically, the issue arises from using `datetime.date.today()` instead of `datetime.today().date()`. The `datetime.date` is a class, and you're trying to call `today()` on it directly, which leads to the `AttributeError`.\n\nHere's how you can fix the method `was_published_today`:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nclass Poll(models.Model):\n    question = models.CharField(max_length=200)\n    pub_date = models.DateTimeField('date published')\n\n    def __unicode__(self):\n        return self.question\n\n    def was_published_today(self):\n        return self.pub_date.date() == datetime.today().date()\n```\n\nBy changing `datetime.date.today()` to `datetime.today().date()`, you're first calling `datetime.today()` to get the current date and time, and then invoking `.date()` to extract just the date portion. This should resolve the AttributeError you're encountering. \n\nAfter making this change, try running your method in the Python shell again:\n\n```python\np = Poll.objects.get(pk=1)\np.was_published_today()\n```\n\nThis should now execute without errors, assuming everything else with your model and database setup is correct."
