I am currently using a `for` loop with `enumerate` to achieve this. However, I would like to know how to do this with list comprehension, especially in a scenario where I do not have access to the indices through `enumerate`. Here is the code I have tried:\n\n```python\nfor ind, obj in enumerate(list1):\n    if 4 > ind > 0:\n        list2.append(obj)\n```\n\nI tried to write it using list comprehension like this:\n\n```python\nlist2 = [x for x in list1 if 4 > ind > 0]\n```\n\nAnd also like this:\n\n```python\nlist2 = [x for x in enumerate(list1) if 4 > ind > 0]\n```\n\nHowever, I am not sure if these are correct since I do not have an `ind` number. Can you help me solve this problem?"

        "content": "To create a new list `list2` using list comprehension that contains all the items from `list1` with indices from 1 to 3, you can make use of Python's list slicing technique. List slicing is a very efficient way to achieve this without explicitly using indices in the list comprehension itself. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nlist2 = list1[1:4]\n```\n\nThis line of code will slice `list1` starting from index 1 up to but not including index 4, which effectively gives you the elements at indices 1, 2, and 3.\n\nIf you specifically want to use list comprehension while mimicking the behavior of your for loop example, you can use the `range` function to generate the indices you want and then access the elements of `list1` using those indices. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nlist2 = [list1[i] for i in range(1, 4)]\n```\n\nThis list comprehension iterates over the range of indices from 1 to 3 (inclusive of 1 and exclusive of 4), and for each index `i`, it takes the element `list1[i]` and adds it to `list2`."
