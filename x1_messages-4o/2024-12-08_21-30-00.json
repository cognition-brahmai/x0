The structure should include fields for personal information, grades, attendance records, and disciplinary actions. Here's a proposed structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"students\": [\n    {\n      \"student_id\": \"S001\",\n      \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n      \"grade_level\": \"10\",\n      \"subjects\": {\n        \"Mathematics\": {\n          \"grades\": [\n            {\"term\": \"Term 1\", \"grade\": \"A\"},\n            {\"term\": \"Term 2\", \"grade\": \"B+\"}\n          ]\n        },\n        \"Science\": {\n          \"grades\": [\n            {\"term\": \"Term 1\", \"grade\": \"A-\"},\n            {\"term\": \"Term 2\", \"grade\": \"A\"}\n          ]\n        }\n        // Add more subjects as needed\n      },\n      \"attendance\": {\n        \"total_days\": 200,\n        \"absent_days\": 10,\n        \"late_days\": 5\n      },\n      \"disciplinary_actions\": [\n        {\n          \"date\": \"2023-03-15\",\n          \"action\": \"Warning\",\n          \"reason\": \"Incomplete homework\"\n        }\n        // Add more actions as needed\n      ]\n    }\n    // Add more students as needed\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **students**: An array to hold multiple student objects.\n  \n- **student_id**: A unique identifier for each student.\n\n- **name**: The full name of the student.\n\n- **grade_level**: The current grade level the student is in.\n\n- **subjects**: An object where each subject is a key. Each subject contains an array of grades, with each grade entry specifying the term and grade received.\n\n- **attendance**: An object that tracks attendance details including total school days, days absent, and days late.\n\n- **disciplinary_actions**: An array of objects, each representing a disciplinary action with a date, type of action, and reason.\n\nThis structure allows for efficient storage and retrieval of a student's performance data throughout the academic year. You can easily access and update any student's information by iterating through the `students` array and accessing the desired fields."
