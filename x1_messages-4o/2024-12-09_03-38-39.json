        "content": "The error message you're encountering indicates that CMake cannot find a `CMakeLists.txt` file in the specified directory. This file is crucial for CMake to configure the build process.\n\nHere are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify the Directory Structure**:\n   - Ensure that you're running the `cmake` command in the correct directory. The `CMakeLists.txt` file should be present in the root of the `opencv` directory, not `opencv_contrib`.\n   - The `opencv_contrib` repository contains additional modules for OpenCV, and the `CMakeLists.txt` file is typically found in the main `opencv` repository.\n\n2. **Clone the Correct Repositories**:\n   - Make sure you have cloned both the `opencv` and `opencv_contrib` repositories from GitHub. If you haven't, you can do so with the following commands:\n     ```bash\n     git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git\n     git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib.git\n     ```\n\n3. **Correct Usage of the `cmake` Command**:\n   - Navigate to the `build` directory inside the main `opencv` repository, not `opencv_contrib`.\n   - The command should be executed from the `opencv` directory's `build` folder, specifying the `opencv_contrib/modules` path correctly:\n     ```bash\n     mkdir -p ~/opencv/build\n     cd ~/opencv/build\n     cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE \\\n           -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \\\n           -D INSTALL_C_EXAMPLES=ON \\\n           -D INSTALL_PYTHON_EXAMPLES=ON \\\n           -D OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=~/opencv_contrib/modules \\\n           -D BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON ..\n     ```\n\n4. **Check for Typos**:\n   - Ensure there are no typos in the command. For example, `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX+/usr/local` should be `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local`.\n\n5. **Ensure Proper Branches**:\n   - Make sure both the `opencv` and `opencv_contrib` repositories are on the same branch, ideally the latest stable release or a specific version you wish to build.\n\n6. **Install Required Dependencies**:\n   - Ensure that all the required dependencies are installed. You can do this by updating and installing the necessary packages:\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt-get update\n     sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake git pkg-config libgtk-3-dev \\\n                          libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev \\\n                          libv4l-dev libxvidcore-dev libx264-dev \\\n                          libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev \\\n                          gfortran openexr libatlas-base-dev \\\n                          python3-dev python3-numpy libtbb2 libtbb-dev \\\n                          libdc1394-22-dev\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the CMake error and proceed with building and installing OpenCV with the contrib modules on your system."
