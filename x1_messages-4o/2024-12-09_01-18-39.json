I am aware that the obvious solution is to split the string by underscore, capitalize each word except the first one and then join them all back together. However, I am interested in learning about more idiomatic solutions or ways to use `RegExp` to achieve the same result. Are there any case modifiers that I can use?"

        "content": "In Python 2.7, you can indeed use regular expressions to help with the conversion from snake case to lower camel case. While there aren't built-in case modifiers specifically for this task, you can use the `re` module to achieve the desired transformation.\n\nHere's an example of how you might do it using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef snake_to_camel(snake_str):\n    # Use a regular expression to find all underscores followed by a letter\n    return re.sub(r'_(.)', lambda match: match.group(1).upper(), snake_str)\n\n# Example usage\nsnake_case_string = \"my_string_example\"\ncamel_case_string = snake_to_camel(snake_case_string)\nprint(camel_case_string)  # Output: myStringExample\n```\n\nThis code works by using the `re.sub()` function to replace each underscore followed by a letter with the uppercase version of that letter. The regular expression `r'_(.)'` matches an underscore followed by any character (captured in a group), and the `lambda` function transforms the matched letter to uppercase.\n\nThis approach is quite idiomatic and leverages the power of regular expressions to perform the transformation in a concise manner. Note that this method assumes the input is in valid snake case format and doesn't handle edge cases like leading or trailing underscores."
