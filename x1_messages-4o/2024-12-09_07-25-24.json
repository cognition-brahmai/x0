The only method I've found that works is to set the series as the index, query the month and year from the index, and then reconstruct a new time series using the year, month, and 1 as the day. I'm looking for a simpler solution that doesn't require the series to be set as the index. I also found that the `month start` is an offset and not what I need. There doesn't seem to be a `set()` function for the method, and even less functionality while the series is a column, and not part of the index. I found a related question on Stack Overflow, but the solution there isn't applicable to my situation. Is there a simpler way to change the day to 1 in a datetime series in pandas?"

You can extract the year and month from the datetime series and then reconstruct the dates with the day set to 1 using `pd.to_datetime()`. Here's a simpler approach:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample datetime series\ndate_series = pd.Series(pd.to_datetime(['2023-07-15', '2023-08-20', '2023-09-25']))\n\n# Set the day to 1 for each entry\ndate_series_start_of_month = pd.to_datetime(date_series.dt.year.astype(str) + '-' +\n                                            date_series.dt.month.astype(str) + '-01')\n\nprint(date_series_start_of_month)\n```\n\nThis code converts each date in the series to the first day of its respective month by:\n\n1. Extracting the year and month using `dt.year` and `dt.month`.\n2. Concatenating them with `'-01'` to form a string in the format `yyyy-mm-01`.\n3. Converting this string back to a datetime object using `pd.to_datetime()`.\n\nThis method is efficient and doesn't require modifying the index of the DataFrame or Series."
