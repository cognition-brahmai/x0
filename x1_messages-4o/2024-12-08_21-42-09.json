        "content": "The equation you've provided, \\(3x + 5y = 9\\), is already an algebraic expression. However, if you're looking to express one variable in terms of the other, you can rearrange it. For example, to express \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\), you can solve for \\(y\\):\n\n1. Subtract \\(3x\\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   5y = 9 - 3x\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide every term by 5 to solve for \\(y\\):\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{9 - 3x}{5}\n   \\]\n\nAlternatively, to express \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\), solve for \\(x\\):\n\n1. Subtract \\(5y\\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   3x = 9 - 5y\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide every term by 3 to solve for \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{9 - 5y}{3}\n   \\]\n\nThese rearrangements are also algebraic expressions based on the original equation."
