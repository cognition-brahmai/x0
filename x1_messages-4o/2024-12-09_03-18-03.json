However, when I use gevent monkey patching, Celery stops working. The tasks seem to be sent to the broker but the Celery worker doesn't process them. If I remove the gevent code, everything works fine. I suspect it might be because gevent is also patching threading. However, when I try to turn off patching threading by using 'monkey.patch_all(thread=False)', Celery crashes without a reason. How can I use both Celery and gevent in my application without encountering these issues?"

        "content": "Using Celery and Gevent together can indeed be challenging due to their interaction with Python's standard library, especially when it comes to monkey patching. Here are some steps and tips you can try to resolve the issues you're facing:\n\n1. **Order of Import**:\n   Ensure that the monkey patching is done as the first import in your application. This ensures that all subsequent imports of libraries and modules take the patched versions of the standard library.\n\n   ```python\n   from gevent import monkey\n   monkey.patch_all()\n\n   # Other imports\n   from celery import Celery\n   ```\n\n2. **Using the Gevent Pool**:\n   When you use Celery with Gevent, you need to specify a Gevent pool for the worker. This can be done by starting the Celery worker with the `-P gevent` option:\n\n   ```bash\n   celery -A your_application worker -P gevent --concurrency=100\n   ```\n\n   Adjust the `--concurrency` level based on your application's requirements and your server's capabilities.\n\n3. **Avoid Blocking Calls**:\n   Ensure that there are no blocking calls within the code that is meant to run with Gevent. This includes avoiding standard threading or multiprocessing libraries unless they are specifically designed to work with Gevent.\n\n4. **Threading Considerations**:\n   If you need to use threading with Gevent, you can use `gevent.threading` which is compatible with Gevent's cooperative scheduling. However, ideally, try to avoid mixing threading with Gevent.\n\n5. **Debugging**:\n   Check Celery logs for any errors or warnings. Sometimes Celery might log useful information that can help in debugging the issue.\n\n6. **Use Celery Configurations**:\n   Make sure your Celery configuration is set up correctly. You might need to tweak settings like `worker_prefetch_multiplier` or `task_acks_late` depending on your task's characteristics.\n\n7. **Celery Version**:\n   Ensure that you're using a compatible version of Celery that supports Gevent. Sometimes compatibility issues arise due to version mismatches.\n\n8. **Broker and Backend**:\n   Ensure that the broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis) and backend you're using are correctly configured and running without issues.\n\n9. **Community and Documentation**:\n   Look into Celery and Gevent's documentation and community forums for any known issues or additional configuration tips.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to use Celery and Gevent together in your application. If the issue persists, consider isolating the problem in a minimal reproducible example to better understand the interaction between Celery and Gevent."
