I am aware that I can do it by explicitly importing every class from that module and checking with a tuple like this:\n\n```python\nfrom my_module import ClassOne, ClassTwo\n\nisinstance(my_obj, (ClassOne, ClassTwo))\n```\n\nBut this gets verbose when the module has many classes. I've tried a few things to avoid this but they didn't work:\n\n```python\nimport my_module\n\n# Test my_obj against the module itself\nisinstance(my_obj, my_module)\n# Gives TypeError: isinstance() arg 2 must be a class, type, or tuple of classes and types\n\n# Try to test against a wildcard attribute on my_module\nisinstance(my_obj, my_module.*)\n# Gives SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n#Try to build a tuple of classes with iteration to check against\nfor klass in my_module:\n# Gives TypeError: 'module' object is not iterable\n```\n\nIs there a way to type check against all the classes in my_module, without explicitly naming them in a tuple?\n\nFurther context: This is for a situation where we are exporting data from a Google App Engine app to an app we have hosted on Rackspace. We are serializing the data with pickle and then sending it over to our Rackspace server with HTTP Requests. Some of the data in the Google App Engine database is of GAE-specific data-types, imported from google.appengine.api.datastore_types. I need to check if any outgoing objects have a type from google.appengine.api.datastore_types and either convert them to a builtin data-type or delete the field off the object, to avoid depickling errors on the Rackspace side."

        "content": "To check if an object is an instance of any class from a specific module without explicitly listing each class, you can use Python's `inspect` module to dynamically retrieve all classes from the module. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport inspect\nimport my_module\n\ndef get_classes_from_module(module):\n    # Get a list of all classes from the module\n    return [member for name, member in inspect.getmembers(module, inspect.isclass)]\n\ndef is_instance_of_module_class(obj, module):\n    # Get all classes from the specified module\n    classes = get_classes_from_module(module)\n    # Check if the object is an instance of any class from the module\n    return isinstance(obj, tuple(classes))\n\n# Usage\nmy_obj = ...  # Your object to check\nif is_instance_of_module_class(my_obj, my_module):\n    print(\"my_obj is an instance of a class from my_module\")\nelse:\n    print(\"my_obj is not an instance of any class from my_module\")\n```\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of the code:\n\n1. **`inspect.getmembers(module, inspect.isclass)`**: This function retrieves all members of the module that are classes. It returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the name and the class object.\n\n2. **List comprehension**: We extract only the class objects from the tuples returned by `inspect.getmembers`.\n\n3. **`is_instance_of_module_class` function**: This function checks if the given object is an instance of any class from the specified module.\n\nThis approach dynamically handles the classes in the module without explicitly listing them, making it adaptable to changes in the module's class definitions.\n\nFor the specific case of handling Google App Engine data types, you can replace `my_module` with `google.appengine.api.datastore_types` to check against those specific classes."
