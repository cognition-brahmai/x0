Also, what is the full specification of this instruction? For instance, can the value include spaces, special symbols, newlines, or even the '-*-' itself? I am asking because I am writing a program that will generate plain text files and I want to include some metadata in those files using this format."

        "content": "The line `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` you encountered is a special comment used in Python to specify the encoding of the source file. This is particularly important for Python 2, where the default encoding is ASCII. Although Python 3 defaults to UTF-8, you may still see this line for compatibility or clarity.\n\n### Origin and Purpose\nThis directive is part of PEP 263, which introduced a way to declare the encoding of a Python source file. The directive allows Python to correctly interpret non-ASCII characters in the source code.\n\n### Specification\nThe specification for this encoding declaration follows these rules:\n\n1. **Format**: The format of the encoding declaration must be `# -*- coding: <encoding-name> -*-`. This should appear on one of the first two lines of the file.\n   \n2. **Position**: It can be placed in the first or second line of the file. The first line can be a shebang (`#!`) line if needed.\n\n3. **Encoding Name**: The `<encoding-name>` should be a valid encoding name recognized by Python. Common examples include `utf-8`, `latin-1`, `ascii`, etc.\n\n4. **Spaces and Symbols**: The declaration can include spaces around the `coding:` part, but the encoding name itself should not contain spaces or special symbols. The `-*-' markers are not strictly necessary but are included by convention to make the coding declaration more visible.\n\n5. **No Newlines**: The encoding declaration should not span multiple lines.\n\n6. **Comments**: The line can include additional comments, but they must follow the encoding declaration.\n\n### Example\nHere's how you might use it:\n\n```python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n# This is a sample Python file with UTF-8 encoding\n```\n\n### Important Considerations\n- **Compatibility**: If your files are to be used in environments where Python 2 is still in use, including this line is recommended.\n- **Readability**: Even in Python 3, using this line can enhance readability and clarify the encoding used.\n\n### Including Metadata\nIf you want to include additional metadata in your plain text files using this format, you might consider using structured comments or adopting a similar convention for your metadata. However, keep the encoding declaration line solely for specifying the file encoding."
