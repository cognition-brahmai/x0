You can specify the content type by setting the `mimetype` attribute of the `Response` object. Here's how you can modify your code to return XML with the appropriate content type:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, Response\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/ajax_ddl')\ndef ajax_ddl():\n    xml = '<root><foo>bar</foo></root>'  # Your XML content\n    response = Response(xml, mimetype='text/xml')\n    return response\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run()\n```\n\nIn this code, the `Response` object is used to set the content type to `text/xml` by specifying it in the `mimetype` parameter. This will ensure that the client interprets the response as XML. You can replace the `xml` variable with your actual XML content."
