        "content": "Is it possible to add a where clause with list comprehension in Python? For instance, I have a list comprehension `[ (x,f(x)) for x in iterable if f(x) ]` which filters the iterable based on a condition `f` and returns the pairs of `x,f(x)`. The issue here is `f(x)` is computed twice. I would like to avoid this by writing something like `[ (x,fx) for x in iterable if fx where fx = f(x) ]` or `[ (x,fx) for x in iterable if fx with f(x) as fx ]`. However, in Python, I have to use nested comprehensions to avoid the duplicate call to `f(x)`, which makes the comprehension less clear, like `[ (x,fx) for x,fx in ( (y,f(y) for y in iterable ) if fx ]`. Is there a more Pythonic, readable way to achieve the same result?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve the desired result in a more Pythonic and readable way by using a generator expression to compute `f(x)` just once and then unpacking the result in your list comprehension. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nresult = [(x, fx) for x in iterable for fx in [f(x)] if fx]\n```\n\nIn this approach, the expression `[f(x)]` creates a temporary list with a single element `f(x)`, and `fx` is assigned this value. The `if fx` condition then checks the truthiness of `fx`, ensuring it's only included if it meets the condition.\n\nThis method avoids recomputing `f(x)` and keeps the comprehension concise and readable."
