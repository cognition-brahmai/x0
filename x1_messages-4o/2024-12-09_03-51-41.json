I have attempted to identify the slow parts of my code using the `logging` module, but I've found that consecutive `logging.info()` calls can sometimes have a gap of almost 800 ms between them. Can anyone explain why this is happening? My hypothesis is disk latencies, as I have several workers running simultaneously and I'm using a rotational disk, not an SSD. Should I avoid logging altogether to avoid these latencies? I've tried switching to initialization code suggested by Vinay Sajip, but the latencies still persist. Is the source of these latencies in the `logging` module?"

        "content": "The latencies you are experiencing when using the `logging` module in your real-time REST API can indeed be influenced by several factors, especially given your setup with multiple workers and a rotational disk. Let's explore some potential reasons and solutions:\n\n1. **Disk I/O Latency**: As you suspect, the use of a rotational disk could be contributing significantly to the latency. Logging operations involve writing to disk, and on a rotational disk, this can be slower compared to an SSD. This is especially true when multiple workers are writing logs simultaneously, leading to I/O contention.\n\n2. **Logging Configuration**: The configuration of the `logging` module can also impact performance. For example, using `logging.basicConfig()` writes logs to a file and might block if disk I/O is slow. Consider using asynchronous logging to mitigate this issue.\n\n3. **Asynchronous or Buffered Logging**: You can reduce the impact of disk I/O by using a logging handler that buffers logs or sends them to another thread/process for writing. The `QueueHandler` and `QueueListener` in the logging module can help achieve this by offloading the actual disk writing to a separate thread or process.\n\n4. **Log Level and Frequency**: Ensure that you are logging only essential information and at an appropriate level. Excessive logging, especially at the `INFO` level, can contribute to latency. Consider using a higher log level for less critical information in a production environment.\n\n5. **Log Rotation and Compression**: If you're using file handlers with log rotation, ensure that the rotation process (especially compression) does not occur during peak times, as this can temporarily increase disk I/O.\n\n6. **Benchmark Without Logging**: To confirm that logging is the primary source of latency, you could temporarily disable logging and measure the response times. If latency significantly improves, then logging is likely the main contributor.\n\n7. **Use SSD or External Logging Service**: If feasible, transition to an SSD for your server to significantly reduce disk latency. Alternatively, consider using an external logging service that can handle log ingestion asynchronously.\n\n8. **Profile Your Application**: Use profiling tools to identify other potential bottlenecks in your code. It's possible that other parts of your code are contributing to the latency, and comprehensive profiling can provide insights.\n\nIn conclusion, while logging can indeed introduce latency due to disk I/O, there are several strategies to mitigate this, including asynchronous logging, optimizing logging configuration, and using faster storage solutions. Experimenting with these options should help you reduce the latency in your application."
