However, some of these files are quite large, about 1 GB or more. I am looking for a way to read the file line by line off the server rather than storing the whole file in a variable. Additionally, I have found that when reading a chunk of data and splitting it into lines, the data received in the buffer is sometimes incomplete. For example, the last line of a 300 line buffer might only be half of the actual line on the server, with the next half fetched in the subsequent call. How can I ensure that I am always fetching complete lines? Also, is there a command that can print lines in a file in a certain range, like the first 100 lines, then the next 100, and so on?"

        "content": "To efficiently read a large file line by line over SSH with Paramiko, you can use a combination of SSH channel operations and Unix commands. Here's a strategy to achieve this:\n\n1. **Use the `sed` command to fetch specific lines**: You can use the `sed` command to fetch specific ranges of lines from a file. For example, to fetch lines 1 to 100, you can use:\n   ```bash\n   sed -n '1,100p' filename\n   ```\n   To get the next 100 lines, you would use:\n   ```bash\n   sed -n '101,200p' filename\n   ```\n\n2. **Fetch lines in chunks**: You can create a loop in your Python script to continuously fetch the next set of lines using `sed`, and process them as needed. This way, you avoid loading the entire file into memory.\n\n3. **Handle incomplete lines**: If you read chunks and split them into lines, you may encounter incomplete lines at the boundaries. To mitigate this, always keep the last partial line in each chunk and prepend it to the next chunk before splitting. This ensures that you handle the boundary case correctly.\n\nHere's a sample Python script using Paramiko to read a file line by line using this approach:\n\n```python\nimport paramiko\n\ndef read_file_line_by_line(host, username, password, filename, chunk_size=100):\n    # Set up the SSH client\n    client = paramiko.SSHClient()\n    client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())\n    client.connect(host, username=username, password=password)\n\n    # Start reading the file in chunks\n    line_offset = 1\n    partial_line = ''\n    while True:\n        # Construct the sed command\n        command = f\"sed -n '{line_offset},{line_offset + chunk_size - 1}p' {filename}\"\n\n        # Execute the command\n        stdin, stdout, stderr = client.exec_command(command)\n        \n        # Read the output\n        lines = stdout.read().decode('utf-8')\n        \n        # If there's nothing to read, break the loop\n        if not lines.strip():\n            break\n\n        # Prepend partial line from previous chunk\n        lines = partial_line + lines\n\n        # Split the lines\n        lines = lines.split('\\n')\n\n        # Keep the last line as partial (in case it's incomplete)\n        partial_line = lines.pop() if lines else ''\n\n        # Process each complete line\n        for line in lines:\n            print(line)  # Replace with your processing logic\n\n        # Move to the next chunk\n        line_offset += chunk_size\n\n    # Close the SSH connection\n    client.close()\n\n# Usage example\nread_file_line_by_line('your.server.com', 'username', 'password', '/path/to/your/file')\n```\n\nThis script connects to the server via SSH, executes the `sed` command to fetch a specific range of lines, and reads them in chunks. The lines are processed one by one, and any partial line at the end of a chunk is preserved and prepended to the next chunk to ensure completeness. Adjust the `chunk_size` as needed based on your memory and performance requirements."
