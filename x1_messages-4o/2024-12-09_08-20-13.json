        "content": "In Python 2.6, you can use a dictionary comprehension to multiply each value by 2. However, dictionary comprehensions were introduced in Python 2.7. But you can achieve the same result using a generator expression with the `dict()` function or using a simple loop. Here's how you can do it:\n\nUsing `dict()` with a generator expression:\n```python\noriginal_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\ndoubled_dict = dict((key, value * 2) for key, value in original_dict.items())\n\nprint(doubled_dict)\n```\n\nUsing a loop:\n```python\noriginal_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\ndoubled_dict = {}\n\nfor key, value in original_dict.items():\n    doubled_dict[key] = value * 2\n\nprint(doubled_dict)\n```\n\nBoth methods will give you a new dictionary where each value is multiplied by 2."
