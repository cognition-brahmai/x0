        "content": "Catching typos in a scripting language that doesn't have a built-in strict mode can indeed be a bit challenging, but there are several strategies you can employ to mitigate this issue:\n\n1. **Use a Linter**: Many scripting languages have linters available that can help catch common mistakes, including typos. Linters analyze your code for potential errors and enforce coding standards. Some popular linters include ESLint for JavaScript, Pylint for Python, and RuboCop for Ruby.\n\n2. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Features**: Modern IDEs often have features like syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and error detection that can help catch typos as you type. IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, and Atom provide these features and can be extended with plugins for additional functionality.\n\n3. **Code Reviews**: Having a second pair of eyes look over your code can be invaluable. Code reviews not only help catch typos but also improve code quality overall by encouraging discussion and knowledge sharing.\n\n4. **Type Annotations**: If your scripting language supports type annotations or type hinting, use them. While they don't prevent typos directly, they can help catch mismatches between expected and actual data types, which might indicate an underlying typo.\n\n5. **Unit Testing**: While unit testing every constructor and method might seem exhaustive, it's a powerful way to ensure your code behaves as expected. Tests can catch errors that static analysis might not, though they do require more initial effort.\n\n6. **Static Analysis Tools**: Some languages have static analysis tools that can analyze your code without executing it, identifying potential issues like typos or logical errors. Tools like MyPy for Python can help in this regard.\n\n7. **Custom Scripts**: If no existing tool fits your needs, you can write custom scripts to perform checks specific to your codebase. This approach requires more effort but can be tailored to catch the specific kinds of typos you're concerned about.\n\n8. **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Establishing and adhering to consistent naming conventions across your codebase can help reduce the likelihood of typos. Consistent naming makes it easier to spot anomalies that might indicate a typo.\n\n9. **Refactoring Tools**: Some IDEs and tools offer refactoring capabilities that can help rename variables or functions consistently throughout your code, reducing the chance of typos during manual renaming processes.\n\nBy combining these strategies, you can effectively reduce the number of typos in your code and improve overall code quality, even in languages without a strict mode."
