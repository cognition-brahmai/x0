Here is an example of such code:\n\n```python\nfig.legend([line1, line2], ['series1', 'series2'], bbox_to_anchor=[0.5, 0.5], \n           loc='center', ncol=2)\n```\n\nI have noticed that sometimes `bbox_to_anchor` is used after `loc`. While I understand the purpose of using `bbox_to_anchor` and `loc` separately, I am unsure if there is any benefit to using both in the same legend specification. From my understanding, it seems that if `bbox_to_anchor` is specified, then the `loc` parameter doesn't really matter. I haven't found any documentation regarding this. Can anyone confirm this for me?"

        "content": "When customizing the legend location in Matplotlib, both `loc` and `bbox_to_anchor` can be used together to achieve precise positioning, and they serve complementary purposes.\n\n1. **`loc` Parameter**: This parameter specifies the anchor point on the legend box itself. For example, `loc='center'` means the center of the legend box will be used as the reference point for positioning.\n\n2. **`bbox_to_anchor` Parameter**: This is a more flexible way to specify the location where the legend should be placed. It takes a tuple or list of coordinates and specifies the anchor point in the Axes or Figure coordinate system.\n\nWhen you use both `loc` and `bbox_to_anchor` together, here's what happens:\n\n- The `loc` parameter tells Matplotlib which part of the legend box you want to align to the specified position given by `bbox_to_anchor`.\n- The `bbox_to_anchor` defines the position in the Axes or Figure where that part of the legend (specified by `loc`) should be placed.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why you might use both:\n\n- **Fine-Tuned Positioning**: By combining both, you can achieve very precise control over where the legend appears. This is particularly useful when you need the legend to be in a specific location that isn't covered by the default options provided by `loc` alone (like 'upper right', 'lower left', etc.).\n  \n- **Responsiveness to Figure Size Changes**: Using both parameters can help maintain the relative position of the legend when the figure size changes. This is because `bbox_to_anchor` can be specified in relative coordinates (e.g., [0.5, 0.5] for the center of the Axes), ensuring the legend stays in a desirable position regardless of resizing.\n\nIn summary, using both `loc` and `bbox_to_anchor` together allows for greater flexibility and precision in legend placement. While `bbox_to_anchor` sets the reference point in the coordinate system, `loc` determines which part of the legend box aligns with that reference point."
