I am mostly utilizing `NaiveBayesian`. I considered using nltk's `NaiveClassification`, but it seems it can't handle continuous variables. What other frameworks or options can handle this type of classification in Python?"

        "content": "If you're looking for alternatives to the Orange Framework for Naive Bayesian classification in Python, several libraries offer robust and well-documented implementations. Here are a few options that can handle both discrete and continuous variables:\n\n1. **scikit-learn**:\n   - **GaussianNB**: This is part of scikit-learn and is specifically designed to handle continuous variables by assuming they follow a Gaussian distribution. It's user-friendly and well-documented.\n   - **CategoricalNB** and **MultinomialNB**: These are also available in scikit-learn for handling categorical data and multinomially distributed data, respectively.\n\n   Example usage:\n   ```python\n   from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB\n   model = GaussianNB()\n   model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n   predictions = model.predict(X_test)\n   ```\n\n2. **pandas and statsmodels**:\n   - If you're comfortable working with dataframes, you can preprocess your data using pandas and then use statsmodels for statistical models, which include Bayesian methods.\n\n3. **PyMC3**:\n   - For a more probabilistic programming approach, PyMC3 allows you to define your Bayesian models with great flexibility. It can handle continuous variables but requires a more in-depth understanding of Bayesian statistics.\n\n4. **TensorFlow Probability**:\n   - If you're working within the TensorFlow ecosystem, TensorFlow Probability provides tools for probabilistic reasoning and statistical analysis, including Bayesian inference.\n\n5. **BayesPy**:\n   - This library offers tools for Bayesian inference with a focus on variational methods. It can be used for more complex models that require continuous variables.\n\nEach of these libraries has its own strengths, so the best choice depends on your specific needs, such as ease of use, flexibility, or integration with other tools. If you're looking for something straightforward and efficient, scikit-learn's `GaussianNB` is a solid choice for handling continuous data."
