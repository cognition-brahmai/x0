        "content": "The error you're facing is due to trying to concatenate a string (or unicode string) directly to a tuple. In Python, tuples can only be concatenated with other tuples. To resolve this issue, you need to make sure that the `new.id` is wrapped in a tuple before concatenating it with your existing tuple.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Assuming mytuple is your existing tuple and new.id is the new ID you want to add\n\n# Convert new.id to a tuple by wrapping it in a single-element tuple\nnew_tuple = (new.id,)\n\n# Concatenate the tuples\nmytuple = mytuple + new_tuple\n\n# Now mytuple will have all the IDs\n```\n\nThis method ensures that `new.id` is treated as a tuple, which allows for proper concatenation with the existing `mytuple`.\n\nAlternatively, if you are dealing with IDs as strings and want to keep them that way, ensure that `new.id` is in the correct format. If `new.id` is a unicode string (like `u'2'`), it would still work as long as it's wrapped in a tuple for concatenation. If you're using Python 3, strings are unicode by default, so you can simply wrap it in a tuple as shown above."
