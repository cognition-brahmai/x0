I am using classes so I can later insert the code into a larger program. However, I am having trouble with my buttons not loading correctly. Here is my code:\n\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\n\nclass Demo1(tk.Frame):\n    def __init__(self):\n        tk.Frame.__init__(self)\n        self.pack()\n        self.master.title(\"Demo 1\")\n        self.button1 = tk.Button(self, text = \"Button 1\", width = 25,\n                               command = self.new_window)\n        self.button1.grid(row = 0, column = 1, columnspan = 2, sticky = tk.W+tk.E+tk.N+tk.S)\n\n    def new_window(self):\n        self.newWindow = Demo2()\n\nclass Demo2(tk.Frame):\n    def __init__(self):\n        new = tk.Frame.__init__(self)\n        new = tk.Toplevel(self)\n        new.title(\"Demo 2\")\n        new.button = tk.Button(text = \"Button 2\", width = 25,\n                               command = self.close_window)\n        new.button.pack()\n\n    def close_window(self):\n        self.destroy()\n\ndef main():\n    Demo1().mainloop()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\nHow can I solve this issue?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is due to the way you're initializing and handling the new window in the `Demo2` class. Specifically, you're mixing up the initialization of a `Frame` and a `Toplevel` widget, which is leading to problems. Let's correct the code to ensure that the new window is created and closed properly:\n\n1. Create a `Toplevel` window properly in `Demo2`.\n2. Ensure the button in `Demo2` is correctly associated with the `Toplevel` window.\n\nHere's a corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\n\nclass Demo1(tk.Frame):\n    def __init__(self):\n        tk.Frame.__init__(self)\n        self.pack()\n        self.master.title(\"Demo 1\")\n        self.button1 = tk.Button(self, text=\"Button 1\", width=25,\n                                 command=self.new_window)\n        self.button1.grid(row=0, column=1, columnspan=2, sticky=tk.W + tk.E + tk.N + tk.S)\n\n    def new_window(self):\n        self.newWindow = Demo2(self.master)\n\nclass Demo2:\n    def __init__(self, master):\n        self.new_window = tk.Toplevel(master)\n        self.new_window.title(\"Demo 2\")\n        self.button = tk.Button(self.new_window, text=\"Button 2\", width=25,\n                                command=self.close_window)\n        self.button.pack()\n\n    def close_window(self):\n        self.new_window.destroy()\n\ndef main():\n    root = tk.Tk()\n    app = Demo1()\n    app.mainloop()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n1. **`Demo2` Initialization**: The `Demo2` class now takes `master` as an argument, which is the main window's root. This allows the `Toplevel` window to be properly associated with the main application.\n\n2. **`Toplevel` Initialization**: Instead of using `new = tk.Frame.__init__(self)`, directly create a `Toplevel` window with `self.new_window = tk.Toplevel(master)`.\n\n3. **Button Configuration**: Ensure the button in `Demo2` is correctly added to the `Toplevel` window using `self.new_window`.\n\nThese changes should resolve the issue, allowing the new window to open and close as expected."
