I am aware that I need to create an object with attributes as columns, however, I am uncertain about where to place this code. Should it be in `models.py`? Here is my model:\n\n```\nclass Dodavatel(models.Model):\n    nazov = models.CharField(default='', max_length=255)\n    dostupnost = models.IntegerField(default=0)\n```\n\nAnd here is the code I have for inserting a row:\n\n```\np = Dodavatel(nazov='Petr', dostupnost=1)\np.save()\n```\n\nWhere should I put this code?"

        "content": "In Django, the code to insert data into your database should not be placed in the `models.py` file. Instead, you should use a view, a Django management command, or a Django shell to perform this operation. Here are some common ways to handle data insertion:\n\n1. **Django Shell**: This is a convenient way to interact with your Django models for quick tasks.\n\n   - Run the Django shell with the command `python manage.py shell`.\n   - Import your model and then create and save your object:\n\n     ```python\n     from myapp.models import Dodavatel  # replace 'myapp' with your app name\n     p = Dodavatel(nazov='Petr', dostupnost=1)\n     p.save()\n     ```\n\n2. **Views**: If you want to insert data as part of a web request, you can do it in a view. For example, you might have a form that submits data to a view, and you process it like this:\n\n   ```python\n   from django.shortcuts import render\n   from myapp.models import Dodavatel\n\n   def add_dodavatel(request):\n       if request.method == 'POST':\n           nazov = request.POST.get('nazov')\n           dostupnost = request.POST.get('dostupnost')\n           p = Dodavatel(nazov=nazov, dostupnost=dostupnost)\n           p.save()\n           # Redirect or render a response\n       return render(request, 'add_dodavatel.html')\n   ```\n\n3. **Django Management Command**: If you need to perform data insertion as part of a script, consider creating a custom management command.\n\n   - Create a new file in your app's `management/commands/` directory, for example, `insert_dodavatel.py`.\n   - Implement the command logic:\n\n     ```python\n     from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand\n     from myapp.models import Dodavatel\n\n     class Command(BaseCommand):\n         help = 'Insert a Dodavatel'\n\n         def handle(self, *args, **kwargs):\n             p = Dodavatel(nazov='Petr', dostupnost=1)\n             p.save()\n             self.stdout.write(self.style.SUCCESS('Successfully inserted Dodavatel'))\n     ```\n\n   - Run the command using `python manage.py insert_dodavatel`.\n\nEach of these approaches serves different use cases, so choose the one that best fits your needs."
