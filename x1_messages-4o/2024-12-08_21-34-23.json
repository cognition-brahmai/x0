        "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step using the given information:\n\n1. **Total Number of Marbles**: Let's denote the total number of marbles by \\( T \\). We know that \\( T \\) is a prime number.\n\n2. **Red Box Marbles**: Let's denote the number of marbles in the red box by \\( R \\). We know that \\( R \\) is a multiple of 3.\n\n3. **Blue Box Marbles**: Let's denote the number of marbles in the blue box by \\( B \\). Therefore, the equation is \\( T = R + B \\).\n\nSince \\( T \\) is a prime number, it can only be divided evenly by 1 and itself. This has implications for \\( R \\) and \\( B \\):\n\n- Since \\( R \\) is a multiple of 3, let's denote it as \\( R = 3k \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\n- Substituting this into the equation for the total number of marbles, we have \\( T = 3k + B \\).\n\n- Rearranging gives \\( B = T - 3k \\).\n\nFor \\( B \\) to be a positive integer, \\( T - 3k > 0 \\).\n\nNow, let's consider the properties of prime numbers:\n\n- If a prime number \\( T \\) is greater than 3, it cannot be a multiple of 3. The only prime number that is a multiple of 3 is 3 itself. Therefore, if \\( T \\) is greater than 3, \\( T \\equiv 1 \\) or \\( 2 \\pmod{3} \\).\n\n- Therefore, the only feasible prime number \\( T \\) that satisfies \\( R = 3k \\) for some integer \\( k \\) is \\( T = 3 \\).\n\nIf \\( T = 3 \\), then the possible values for \\( R \\) are 0 or 3. If \\( R = 0 \\), then \\( B = 3 \\), and if \\( R = 3 \\), then \\( B = 0 \\).\n\nThus, the only solution that fits all the conditions is when the total number of marbles is 3, with either:\n\n- 0 marbles in the red box and 3 marbles in the blue box, or\n- 3 marbles in the red box and 0 marbles in the blue box.\n\nThese are the only possibilities, given the constraints."
