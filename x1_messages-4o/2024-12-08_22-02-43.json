        "content": "To solve this problem, we can utilize the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (\\(c\\)) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (\\(a\\) and \\(b\\)). The formula is:\n\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\]\n\nGiven that the legs of the triangle are 6 and 8, we can calculate the hypotenuse:\n\n\\[ c^2 = 6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100 \\]\n\n\\[ c = \\sqrt{100} = 10 \\]\n\nThe hypotenuse is 10, which is indeed a multiple of 5.\n\nNow, let's find the area of the triangle. The area (\\(A\\)) of a right triangle is given by:\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\]\n\nHere, the base and height are the legs of the triangle (6 and 8):\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 8 = 24 \\]\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 24 square units.\n\nIn simplified radical form for the area, since the area itself is a whole number, it remains 24.\n\n**LaTeX Diagram:**\n\nTo create a diagram of the triangle using LaTeX, we can use the `tikz` package. Here's a simple representation:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{standalone}\n\\usepackage{tikz}\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{tikzpicture}\n    % Draw the right triangle\n    \\draw[thick] (0,0) -- (6,0) -- (6,8) -- cycle;\n    % Label the sides\n    \\node at (3,-0.5) {6};\n    \\node at (6.5,4) {8};\n    \\node at (3,4.5) {10};\n    % Right angle box\n    \\draw (6,0) rectangle (5.5,0.5);\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n**Significance of the Pythagorean Theorem:**\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental principle in mathematics, especially in geometry. It provides a method to calculate the length of one side of a right-angled triangle when the lengths of the other two sides are known. This theorem is not only crucial for mathematical calculations but also has numerous real-life applications.\n\nIn architecture and construction, the Pythagorean theorem helps ensure that structures are built accurately, particularly when creating right angles. It's used in navigation and geographic information systems (GIS) for calculating distances between points on a plane. Engineers and designers use it in various fields, including robotics, computer graphics, and even in the development of algorithms in data science. Its simplicity and applicability make it one of the most important theorems in mathematics, demonstrating the profound connection between geometry and algebra."
