        "content": "To check a Python script for syntax errors without executing it, you can use the `-m py_compile` module, which compiles the script and reports any syntax errors. This approach works for both Python 2 and Python 3. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Python 3\n\n1. Open your terminal or command prompt.\n2. Run the following command:\n\n```bash\npython3 -m py_compile your_script.py\n```\n\nReplace `your_script.py` with the path to your Python script.\n\n### Python 2\n\n1. Open your terminal or command prompt.\n2. Run the following command:\n\n```bash\npython2 -m py_compile your_script.py\n```\n\nAgain, replace `your_script.py` with the path to your Python script.\n\n### Explanation\n\n- The `-m py_compile` option tells Python to use the `py_compile` module, which is specifically designed to compile Python source files.\n- If there are any syntax errors in the script, they will be reported to you.\n- If the script is free of syntax errors, a compiled `.pyc` file will be generated in the `__pycache__` directory (in Python 3) or alongside the original script (in Python 2).\n\nThis method is especially useful for quickly checking scripts for syntax issues without risking execution of any potentially harmful code."
