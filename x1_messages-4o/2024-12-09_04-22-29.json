        "content": "In Python, is it acceptable to raise a built-in exception or warning with custom text? The documentation mentions that a ValueError exception is raised when a built-in operation or function receives an incorrect argument. Does this imply that only built-in operations should raise a ValueError exception? While I understand that it's safe to create an exception class that inherits from ValueError or Exception, is it also okay to directly raise a ValueError with a custom message? Since ValueError is built-in, raising a ValueError with a custom message allows users to quickly identify the type of problem, as opposed to a custom exception type which is non-standard."

        "content": "Yes, it is perfectly acceptable to raise a built-in exception like `ValueError` with a custom message in Python. The documentation you're referring to gives guidance on when a `ValueError` is appropriate, specifically when a function or operation receives an argument of the right type but an inappropriate value. This is not limited to just built-in functions or operations, but can be applied to your own functions as well.\n\nRaising a `ValueError` with a custom message is a common practice and helps in maintaining consistency and clarity in your code. It allows users of your code to understand the type of error that occurred and provides additional context through the custom message. For example:\n\n```python\ndef process_number(number):\n    if number < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Number must be non-negative. Provided: {}\".format(number))\n    # Rest of the function logic\n\ntry:\n    process_number(-5)\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(e)\n```\n\nIn this example, raising a `ValueError` clearly indicates that the issue is with the value provided to the function, and the custom message provides additional details.\n\nUsing built-in exceptions with custom messages is often preferred because it leverages the familiarity that other developers have with these exceptions, making your code more readable and maintainable. However, if you have a very specific error scenario that doesn't quite fit with the semantics of the existing built-in exceptions, defining a custom exception class could be more appropriate. But for most common cases, especially where the error fits well with a built-in exception, using a `ValueError` or similar with a custom message is a good approach."
