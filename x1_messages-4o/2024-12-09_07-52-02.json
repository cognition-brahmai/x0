        "content": "To install the PyMC library from a local source on a Windows PC that is behind a complex proxy, you can follow these steps. This method involves downloading the package manually on a device with internet access and then transferring it to your offline machine.\n\n### Step 1: Download the PyMC Package and Dependencies\n\n1. **Find the PyMC Package and Dependencies:**\n   - On a machine with internet access, use the `conda` command to determine which packages and dependencies are needed for PyMC. You can do this by creating an environment file:\n     ```bash\n     conda create --name pymc_env pymc --dry-run --json > pymc_env_spec.json\n     ```\n   - Review the `pymc_env_spec.json` file to see all the packages and versions required.\n\n2. **Download Packages:**\n   - Use the `conda` command to download the packages without installing them:\n     ```bash\n     conda install --download-only --yes --prefix ./pymc_packages pymc\n     ```\n   - This will download all the necessary packages into the `pymc_packages` directory.\n\n3. **Transfer Files:**\n   - Transfer the `pymc_packages` directory to your offline Windows PC using a USB drive or any other method.\n\n### Step 2: Install the PyMC Package Locally\n\n1. **Set Up a Local Conda Channel:**\n   - On your offline Windows PC, set up the local directory as a conda channel:\n     ```bash\n     conda index ./pymc_packages\n     ```\n\n2. **Configure Conda to Use the Local Channel:**\n   - Update your `.condarc` file to point to the local directory as a channel. You can do this by adding the following lines:\n     ```yaml\n     channels:\n       - file:///path/to/pymc_packages\n       - defaults\n     ```\n\n3. **Install PyMC:**\n   - With the local channel set up, you can now create a new environment and install PyMC from the local directory:\n     ```bash\n     conda create --name pymc_env pymc\n     conda activate pymc_env\n     ```\n\n### Step 3: Handling SSL Verification Error\n\nIf you still encounter SSL verification errors due to the proxy settings, you can temporarily disable SSL verification, though this is not recommended for security reasons. Add the following line to your `.condarc` file:\n\n```yaml\nssl_verify: false\n```\n\nRemember to re-enable SSL verification once you have completed the installation to maintain security.\n\n### Note:\n- Always ensure your downloaded packages are from a trusted source to avoid security risks.\n- The method of disabling SSL verification should only be used if absolutely necessary and with caution.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to install the PyMC library on your offline Windows PC without encountering SSL verification errors."
