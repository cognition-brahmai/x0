Also, I would like the function to return the index of the element where the subsequence starts. For example, if I call `seq_in_seq([5,6],  [4,'a',3,5,6])`, it should return 3. If the sequence is not found, it should return -1 or None."

        "content": "To efficiently determine if a sequence is present within another sequence and find the starting index of the subsequence, you can make use of the `itertools` library, specifically the `islice` function, along with a sliding window approach. This way, you can avoid the inefficiencies of a brute-force method. Here's a sample implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import islice\n\ndef seq_in_seq(subseq, seq):\n    \"\"\"Return the start index of subseq in seq, or -1 if not found.\"\"\"\n    sub_len = len(subseq)\n    seq_len = len(seq)\n    \n    if sub_len == 0:\n        return 0  # An empty subsequence is always at the start.\n    \n    if sub_len > seq_len:\n        return -1  # The subsequence cannot be in the sequence if it's longer.\n    \n    for i in range(seq_len - sub_len + 1):\n        # Use slicing to extract a window of the same length as subseq\n        if seq[i:i + sub_len] == subseq:\n            return i\n    \n    return -1\n\n# Example usage\nprint(seq_in_seq([5, 6], [4, 'a', 3, 5, 6]))  # Output: 3\nprint(seq_in_seq([5, 7], [4, 'a', 3, 5, 6]))  # Output: -1\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Slicing**: The `seq[i:i + sub_len]` expression extracts a slice of the sequence that is the same length as the subsequence.\n- **Comparison**: It then checks if this slice equals the subsequence.\n- **Efficiency**: This approach checks each possible starting position of the subsequence within the sequence only once, which is more efficient than checking every individual pair of elements.\n\nThis method is straightforward and efficient for moderate-sized sequences. If you're dealing with very large sequences or need even more efficiency (e.g., in competitive programming contexts), you could look into advanced algorithms like the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm, which provides better performance for specific types of subsequence searching problems."
