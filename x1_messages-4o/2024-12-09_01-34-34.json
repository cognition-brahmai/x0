I've heard about issues with linking intermediate libraries in previous versions of CMake but I am unsure if this has been resolved or not. My code builds fine when I only build the algorithm (Algo), but when I also try to build the test, I get linking errors. For example, I get an undefined reference error for 'cudaMalloc'. Can you help me resolve this issue?\n\nHere is the CMake file for the algorithm (Algo):\n\n```cmake\ncmake_minimum_required (VERSION 3.9)\nproject(${MODULE_NAME}_core LANGUAGES CXX CUDA)\n\nadd_subdirectory(\"${core_impl_dir}\" implementation)\n\nset(cuda_src \"parallel/ParallelComputation.cu\")\nset(cuda_hdr \"parallel/ParallelComputation.h\")\n\nadd_library(${PROJECT_NAME} STATIC \"${cuda_src}\" \"${cuda_hdr}\")\n\ntarget_include_directories (${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC \"include/\" \n\"parallel/\")\n\nsource_group(\"parallel\"  FILES \"${cuda_src}\" \"${cuda_hdr}\")\n\nset_property(TARGET ${PROJECT_NAME} PROPERTY FOLDER ${MODULE_NAME})\n```\n\nAnd here is the CMake file for the test:\n\n```cmake\nproject(${MODULE_NAME}_gtest LANGUAGES CXX CUDA)\n\nadd_subdirectory(\"${gtest_impl_dir}\" implementation)\n\nadd_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} \"${gtest_impl_src}\")\ntarget_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} ${MODULE_NAME}_core)\n\nenable_testing()\nfind_package(GTest REQUIRED)\ninclude_directories(\"${GTEST_INCLUDE_DIRS}\")\n\ntarget_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} ${GTEST_BOTH_LIBRARIES})\n\nsource_group(\"Implementation\\\\Source Files\" FILES \"${gtest_impl_src}\" )\n\nset_property(TARGET ${PROJECT_NAME} PROPERTY FOLDER ${MODULE_NAME})\n\nadd_test(${PROJECT_NAME} ${PROJECT_NAME})\n```"

        "content": "Linking CUDA libraries in CMake can be tricky, especially when dealing with intermediate libraries and older versions of CMake. Here are several steps and suggestions to help you resolve the linking errors you are experiencing:\n\n1. **Ensure CUDA is Properly Linked:**\n   Make sure your CUDA toolkit is properly installed and recognized by CMake. You might need to explicitly link CUDA libraries like `cuda` and `cudart` to your targets.\n\n2. **Link CUDA Libraries Explicitly:**\n   When linking your test executable, you need to ensure that the CUDA runtime libraries are linked. Modify your test CMake file to include CUDA linking:\n\n   ```cmake\n   find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)\n   target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} ${CUDA_LIBRARIES} ${CUDA_CUDART_LIBRARY})\n   ```\n\n3. **Ensure Proper Order of Link Libraries:**\n   The order of libraries in `target_link_libraries` is important. Make sure the core library is linked before the test libraries:\n\n   ```cmake\n   target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} ${MODULE_NAME}_core ${GTEST_BOTH_LIBRARIES} ${CUDA_LIBRARIES} ${CUDA_CUDART_LIBRARY})\n   ```\n\n4. **Use `target_compile_features`:**\n   Ensure that C++11 or later is enabled for your project, as GTest and CUDA often require modern C++ standards:\n\n   ```cmake\n   target_compile_features(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC cxx_std_11)\n   ```\n\n5. **Update CMake Version (if possible):**\n   If feasible, consider updating your CMake version to 3.18 or later. CMake's support for CUDA has improved significantly in more recent versions, and it provides better handling of CUDA dependencies.\n\n6. **Check CUDA Architecture:**\n   Ensure that your CUDA architecture is specified correctly. You can set the architecture using:\n\n   ```cmake\n   set(CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES 52) # Change this to match your GPU's architecture\n   ```\n\n7. **Double-check Paths and Variables:**\n   Ensure the paths and variables like `${core_impl_dir}`, `${gtest_impl_dir}`, and `${gtest_impl_src}` are set correctly and point to the appropriate directories and files.\n\n8. **Verbose Output for Debugging:**\n   Enable verbose makefile generation to see detailed output, which may help identify where the linking issue arises:\n\n   ```shell\n   make VERBOSE=1\n   ```\n\nBy applying these changes, you should be able to resolve the linking errors related to `cudaMalloc` and other CUDA runtime functions. If the issue persists, consider providing more specific error messages or context for further assistance."
