        "content": "To declare a dynamic array in Python, you typically use a list. Lists in Python are dynamic, meaning you can add or remove elements as needed. To remove all items from a list, you can use the `clear()` method or simply reassign the list to an empty list.\n\nSince you are using Python 2.6, the `clear()` method is not available, so you'll need to use another method to clear the list, such as slicing.\n\nBelow is an example of how you can declare a dynamic array (list) and clear it:\n\n```python\n# Declare a dynamic array (list)\nmy_dynamic_array = []\n\n# Add some items to the list\nmy_dynamic_array.append('Item 1')\nmy_dynamic_array.append('Item 2')\nmy_dynamic_array.append('Item 3')\n\nprint(\"Before clearing:\", my_dynamic_array)\n\n# Clear the list by slicing\ndel my_dynamic_array[:]\n\nprint(\"After clearing:\", my_dynamic_array)\n```\n\nIf you are dealing with a ListBox in a GUI application and you want to remove all items regardless of their group name, you would typically interact with the ListBox widget's API to clear its contents. Assuming you're using a GUI library like Tkinter, here's an example:\n\n```python\nimport Tkinter as tk\n\n# Create a simple Tkinter application\nroot = tk.Tk()\n\n# Create a Listbox\nlistbox = tk.Listbox(root)\nlistbox.pack()\n\n# Add items to the Listbox\nlistbox.insert(tk.END, \"Group 1 - Item 1\")\nlistbox.insert(tk.END, \"Group 2 - Item 2\")\nlistbox.insert(tk.END, \"Group 1 - Item 3\")\n\n# Function to clear the Listbox\ndef clear_listbox():\n    listbox.delete(0, tk.END)\n\n# Clear the Listbox\nclear_listbox()\n\n# Run the Tkinter event loop\nroot.mainloop()\n```\n\nThis code will create a basic Tkinter window with a ListBox and demonstrate how to clear all items from it. Keep in mind that Python 2.6 is quite old, and it's recommended to use a more recent version of Python if possible, as it will provide access to updated libraries and features."
