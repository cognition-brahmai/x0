I am using scikit-learn to retain the 'nf' features with the maximum variance. After performing PCA and getting a new matrix 'X_new' that has a shape of n x nf, how can I find out which features have been discarded or the ones that have been retained?\n\nHere's the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n\nnf = 100\npca = PCA(n_components=nf)\n# X is the matrix transposed (n samples on the rows, m features on the columns)\npca.fit(X)\n\nX_new = pca.transform(X)\n```"

        "content": "To determine which original features have been retained or discarded after performing PCA, you need to understand that PCA doesn't directly select or discard specific features from your original matrix. Instead, it creates new features (principal components) that are linear combinations of the original features. These principal components aim to capture the directions of maximum variance in your data.\n\nHowever, if you're interested in understanding the contribution of each original feature to the principal components, you can analyze the `components_` attribute of the PCA object. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Access the Principal Components**: The `components_` attribute contains the principal axes in feature space, representing the directions of maximum variance in the data. Each row corresponds to a principal component, and each column corresponds to an original feature.\n\n2. **Check Feature Contributions**: To see which original features contribute the most to each principal component, you can look at the absolute values of the entries in the `components_`. Larger absolute values indicate a stronger influence of that original feature on the principal component.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Fit PCA\npca.fit(X)\n\n# Principal components (directions of maximum variance)\nprincipal_components = pca.components_\n\n# Absolute values of the principal component matrix for better readability\nabs_principal_components = np.abs(principal_components)\n\n# Find the most influential features for each principal component\n# For example, the top 5 features contributing to each principal component\ntop_features_per_component = np.argsort(-abs_principal_components, axis=1)[:, :5]\n\n# Display the top features for each component\nfor i, top_features in enumerate(top_features_per_component):\n    print(f\"Principal Component {i+1}: Top contributing features indices - {top_features}\")\n```\n\nThis will give you an idea of which original features have the highest influence on each of the retained principal components. Note that because PCA creates new features as combinations of the original ones, you don't directly \"discard\" features, but rather represent them in a new space."
