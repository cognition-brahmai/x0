Here is a custom poem crafted to meet your criteria:\n\n---\n\n**Eternal Threads**\n\nIn gardens where the gentle zephyrs play,  \nA tapestry of love begins to weave.  \nAs Orpheus once charmed the night to day,  \nTwo souls unite, with hearts that dare believe.\n\nThe sun and moon, in dance of time's embrace,  \nReflect the glow within each lover's eyes.  \nTheir love, a river's flow with endless grace,  \nThrough seasons' change, a constant in the skies.\n\nA fortress built with trust and dreams untold,  \nWhere Aphrodite smiles upon their bond.  \nA love that time and trials shall not withhold,  \nAs deep as oceans, vast and far beyond.\n\nLike vines that intertwine in gentle sway,  \nTwo hearts become as one, forever stay.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThemes:\n\n1. **Unity and Permanence**: The poem emphasizes the enduring nature of love and marriage through metaphors like \"tapestry of love\" and \"river's flow.\" These images suggest that love is both a creative and a sustaining force.\n\n2. **Harmony and Balance**: The reference to Orpheus and the dance of the sun and moon illustrates the harmony and balance integral to a successful marriage.
