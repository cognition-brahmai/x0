For instance, given the list `L = [1,2,3,4]`, I want to obtain the combinations `[\"1,2,3\", \"1,2,4\", \"2,3,4\", \"3,4,1\"]`. Is there a one-liner solution to this?"

This function generates combinations without regard to the order of elements, ensuring unique combinations.\n\nHere's a one-liner solution to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\nL = [1, 2, 3, 4]\ncombinations_list = [\",\".join(map(str, comb)) for comb in combinations(L, 3)]\n```\n\nThis will generate the list `[\"1,2,3\", \"1,2,4\", \"1,3,4\", \"2,3,4\"]`.\n\nNote that in your example, `[\"3,4,1\"]` is not included because it is the same combination as `[\"1,3,4\"]` when order doesn't matter. All generated combinations are unique and in lexicographical order."
