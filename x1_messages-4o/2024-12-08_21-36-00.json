Can you tell if the difference between the sum of Set A and the sum of Set B is greater than, less than, or equal to zero? Your goal is to solve this puzzle using your logical and reasoning skills, without using a calculator or any other tool.\nHere are the sets:\n\\textbf{Set A:} 19, 27, 16\n\\textbf{Set B:} 18, 12, 7\nNow, think about the mathematical operations and the purpose of each operation to figure out the solution. Good luck!"
