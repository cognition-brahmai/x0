When I run the command `sudo pip install ipython`, I get an OSError: [Errno: 1] Operation not permitted: '/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/share'. This command seems to fail when trying to create the mentioned directory. Furthermore, when I try to install iPython with the command `sudo pip install --user python`, it also fails without providing any errors. How can I resolve this issue?"

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Avoid Using System Python**:\n   - The Python version that comes pre-installed with macOS is usually protected and not recommended for installing additional packages. Instead, consider installing Python through a package manager like Homebrew or using a version manager like `pyenv`.\n\n2. **Install Homebrew (if not already installed)**:\n   - Open your Terminal and install Homebrew with this command:\n     ```bash\n     /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n     ```\n\n3. **Install Python via Homebrew**:\n   - Once Homebrew is installed, you can install the latest Python version by running:\n     ```bash\n     brew install python\n     ```\n   - This will install Python and pip in `/usr/local/bin`, allowing you to use them without needing `sudo`.\n\n4. **Install iPython Using Homebrew Python**:\n   - First, ensure you're using the Homebrew-installed Python:\n     ```bash\n     which python3\n     which pip3\n     ```\n     They should point to `/usr/local/bin/python3` and `/usr/local/bin/pip3`.\n\n   - Now install iPython:\n     ```bash\n     pip3 install ipython\n     ```\n\n5. **Use `--user` Option for User-Scope Installations**:\n   - If you need to stick with the system Python for some reason, you can install packages at the user level to avoid permission issues:\n     ```bash\n     pip install --user ipython\n     ```\n   - This doesn't require `sudo` and installs packages to the user\u2019s home directory.\n\n6. **Check Your PATH**:\n   - Ensure your PATH is set up correctly to prioritize the Homebrew-installed Python if you have multiple versions:\n     ```bash\n     export PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH\"\n     ```\n   - You can add this line to your `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, or another relevant shell configuration file depending on the shell you use.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to avoid the permission issues and successfully install iPython on your Mac."
