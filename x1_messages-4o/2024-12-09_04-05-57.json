While experimenting with Flask, I've encountered an unusual problem where the '\\n' character doesn't seem to have any effect when viewed in the browser. I've tried using '<br />' but it wasn't successful. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to add a new line from a string using the '\\n' character in Flask? Here's the code I'm working with:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\nfrom flask import render_template\ntest=Flask(__name__)\n@test.route('/')\ndef root():\n    str='yay\\nsuper'\n    return str\ntest.run(debug=True)\n```"

Therefore, when you send text to the browser, any `\\n` characters will be ignored.\n\nHere's how you can modify your Flask application to ensure that new lines are properly rendered in the browser:\n\n1. You can replace `\\n` with `<br>` in your string before returning it. This will render the line breaks correctly in HTML.\n\n2. Alternatively, you can use the `nl2br` filter in Jinja2 templates to convert `\\n` to `<br>` automatically.\n\nHere's an updated version of your code using the second approach:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template_string\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef root():\n    text = 'yay\\nsuper'\n    # Render the string with Jinja2 and use `|nl2br` to convert newlines\n    return render_template_string(\"{{ text | nl2br }}\", text=text)\n\napp.run(debug=True)\n```\n\nIn this example, `render_template_string` is used to render a Jinja2 template directly from a string. The `nl2br` filter is applied to `text`, converting `\\n` characters into `<br>` elements. This will ensure that the browser correctly displays the line breaks."
