        "content": "The error message you're encountering suggests that Python is unable to find the `gensim` module, even though you believe it's installed. Here are several steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify Installation:**\n   Make sure that `gensim` is installed in the Python environment you are using. You can verify this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip show gensim\n   ```\n\n   If `gensim` is installed, it should display information about the package, including the version number. If not, you'll need to install it using:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install gensim\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Python Environment:**\n   Ensure that you are using the correct Python environment where `gensim` is installed. If you are using virtual environments, make sure that the correct environment is activated. You can activate a virtual environment with:\n\n   ```bash\n   # On Windows\n   .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate\n\n   # On Unix or MacOS\n   source venv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n3. **Check Jupyter Notebook Kernel:**\n   If you are using Jupyter Notebook, make sure that the kernel is running the correct Python environment. You can switch kernels in Jupyter by going to `Kernel -> Change kernel`.\n\n4. **Restart Environment:**\n   Sometimes, restarting your terminal, IDE, or Jupyter Notebook can resolve issues related to environment changes not being picked up.\n\n5. **Correct Import Statement:**\n   The error message shows an incorrect method call for `gensim`. You should use the following import statement and method call:\n\n   ```python\n   from gensim.models import KeyedVectors\n   model = KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format('./model/GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin', binary=True)\n   ```\n\n6. **Check for Multiple Python Installations:**\n   If you have multiple versions of Python installed, make sure you are installing and running `gensim` in the same version. You can check the version with:\n\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   ```\n\n7. **IDE Specific Issues:**\n   If you are using an IDE like PyCharm, make sure the interpreter is set to the correct environment where `gensim` is installed. You can check this in the IDE's settings/preferences.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `ImportError` and successfully load your Word2Vec model."
