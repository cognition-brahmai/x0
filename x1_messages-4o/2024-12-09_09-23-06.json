        "content": "Certainly! To search for a specific word within a given string in Python, you can use the `in` keyword or the `find()` method. Here's a simple code snippet using both approaches:\n\n### Using the `in` keyword:\n```python\ndef search_word_in_string(word, string):\n    if word in string:\n        return f\"The word '{word}' was found in the string.\"\n    else:\n        return f\"The word '{word}' was not found in the string.\"\n\n# Example usage\nstring = \"Hello, welcome to the world of Python programming.\"\nword = \"Python\"\nresult = search_word_in_string(word, string)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Using the `find()` method:\n```python\ndef search_word_in_string(word, string):\n    if string.find(word) != -1:\n        return f\"The word '{word}' was found in the string.\"\n    else:\n        return f\"The word '{word}' was not found in the string.\"\n\n# Example usage\nstring = \"Hello, welcome to the world of Python programming.\"\nword = \"Python\"\nresult = search_word_in_string(word, string)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nBoth methods will help you determine if the specific word is present in the given string."
