Can anyone help me solve this problem?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that there might be a conflict with the module name. This often happens if there's a file named `urllib.py` in the same directory as your script, or if there's a naming conflict with another module. Here are a few steps to help you resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check for Naming Conflicts**: \n   - Make sure there is no file named `urllib.py` in the same directory as your script. If there is, rename or remove it.\n\n2. **Check the Python Path**:\n   - Ensure that the directory you're working in doesn't contain any files that might conflict with standard library modules.\n\n3. **Use the Correct URL**:\n   - Ensure the URL has the correct protocol (HTTP/HTTPS). Your code should use `'http://data.pr4e.org/romeo.txt'` instead of `'data.pr4e.org/romeo.txt'`.\n\nHere's the corrected version of your script:\n\n```python\nimport urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error\n\nurl = 'http://data.pr4e.org/romeo.txt'\nfhand = urllib.request.urlopen(url)\ncounts = dict()\n\nfor line in fhand:\n    words = line.decode().split()\n    for word in words:\n        counts[word] = counts.get(word, 0) + 1\n\nprint(counts)\n```\n\n4. **Ensure Correct Python Version**:\n   - Verify that you're running the script with Python 3.6 or newer, as the `urllib` module structure changed between Python 2 and Python 3.\n\n5. **Reinstall Python (if necessary)**:\n   - If none of the above solutions work, consider reinstalling Python to ensure there are no corrupted files in the installation.\n\nThese steps should help you resolve the issue and successfully run your script."
