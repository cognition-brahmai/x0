Given your lists `a` and `b`, you can create a new list that contains the elements of `a` corresponding to the indices specified in `b` as follows:\n\n```python\na = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nb = [0, 2, 4, 5]\n\n# Using list comprehension to extract elements at specific indices\nsublist = [a[i] for i in b]\n\nprint(sublist)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n[0, 2, 4, 5]\n```\n\nThe list comprehension `[a[i] for i in b]` iterates over each index in list `b`, and retrieves the element at that index from list `a`, effectively creating a new list with the desired elements."
