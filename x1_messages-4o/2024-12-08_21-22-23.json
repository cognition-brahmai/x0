However, the catch is that you need to ensure that the 3D models are only visible to users who have solved a puzzle. \nTo accomplish this, you decide to create a code puzzle that users must solve to gain access to the 3D models. The puzzle involves a series of mathematical equations that need to be solved in a specific order to reveal the code.\nHere are the equations:\n- 6 + 8 = ?\n- 12 / 2 = ?\n- 9 - 5 = ?\n- 3 x 7 = ?\n- 10 + 2 = ?\n- 15 / 3 = ?\n- 2 x 8 = ?\n- 7 - 4 = ?\nOnce the user has solved all of the equations, they will have eight answers. They must use these answers to create a unique code using the first letter of each answer. For example, if the answers were 14, 6, 4, 21, 12, 5, 16, and 3, the code would be \"MGUCLPSC\". \nOnly users who have correctly entered the code will be able to see the 3D models on the web page. Good luck!"
