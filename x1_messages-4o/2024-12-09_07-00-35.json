Currently, my code is as follows:\n\n```python\nlist1 = ['a.1','b.2','c.3']\nfor items in list1:\n    alpha,number = items.split('.')\n    print(alpha,number)\n```\n\nThis code outputs as expected:\n\n```shell\na 1\nb 2\nc 3\n```\n\nHowever, when I attempt to set it as an environment variable like this:\n\n```shell\nexport LIST_ITEMS = 'a.1', 'b.2', 'c.3'\n```\n\nAnd then use it in my code like this:\n\n```python\nlist1 = [os.environ.get(\"LIST_ITEMS\")]\nfor items in list1:\n    alpha,number = items.split('.')\n    print(alpha,number)\n```\n\nI end up receiving a ValueError: too many values to unpack. How can I modify the way I pass the list or retrieve it so that I can achieve the same output as without using environment variables?"

        "content": "To pass a list as an environment variable in Python, you'll need to serialize the list into a string format that can be stored in an environment variable, because environment variables can only hold strings. A common approach is to use a delimiter to join the list elements into a single string and then split them back into a list in your Python code.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Set the Environment Variable:**\n\n   Use a delimiter to join the list elements into a single string. A comma is commonly used, but you have to make sure that your list items do not contain the delimiter you choose.\n\n   ```shell\n   export LIST_ITEMS='a.1,b.2,c.3'\n   ```\n\n2. **Retrieve and Process the Environment Variable in Python:**\n\n   Split the string back into a list using the same delimiter.\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n\n   # Retrieve the environment variable\n   list_items_str = os.environ.get(\"LIST_ITEMS\")\n\n   # Convert the string back to a list\n   if list_items_str:\n       list1 = list_items_str.split(',')\n   else:\n       list1 = []  # Handle case where the environment variable is not set\n\n   # Process the list\n   for items in list1:\n       alpha, number = items.split('.')\n       print(alpha, number)\n   ```\n\nThis should give you the desired output:\n\n```shell\na 1\nb 2\nc 3\n```\n\nBy using a delimiter to join and split the list elements, you can effectively pass and retrieve a list via environment variables in Python."
