For instance, given the following list of lists:\n\n```\n[\n[0,1,'f'],\n[4,2,'t'],\n[9,4,'afsd']\n]\n```\nHow can I sort the outer list by the string field (the third element) of the inner lists?"

        "content": "To sort a list of lists in Python based on a specific index of the inner lists, you can use the `sorted()` function along with a `lambda` function as the key. Here's how you can sort the given list of lists by the string field (the third element) of the inner lists:\n\n```python\n# Original list of lists\nlist_of_lists = [\n    [0, 1, 'f'],\n    [4, 2, 't'],\n    [9, 4, 'afsd']\n]\n\n# Sort the list by the third element of each inner list\nsorted_list = sorted(list_of_lists, key=lambda x: x[2])\n\n# Print the sorted list\nprint(sorted_list)\n```\n\nIn this code, `lambda x: x[2]` is used to specify that the sorting should be based on the third element of each inner list (`x[2]`). The `sorted()` function will then sort the outer list according to these elements.\n\nWhen you run this code, you will get the following sorted list:\n\n```\n[\n    [9, 4, 'afsd'],\n    [0, 1, 'f'],\n    [4, 2, 't']\n]\n```\n\nThe list is now sorted by the string values in the third position of each inner list."
