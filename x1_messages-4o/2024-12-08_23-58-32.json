        "content": "To update the HTML table with the publication year for each book, you can use a combination of shell commands and tools like `awk`, `sed`, or `perl` to manipulate the HTML file. I'm assuming you have the publication year data in a format that can be easily matched with the book titles, perhaps in a simple text file or command output. Let\u2019s assume the publication year data is stored in a file named `book_years.txt` with the following format:\n\n```\nThe Catcher in the Rye:1951\nMindset:2006\nCrooked:2013\nDigital Minimalism:2019\n```\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide using `awk` and `sed`:\n\n1. **Prepare the Script**: Create a shell script that reads the `book_years.txt` file and updates the HTML table.\n\n2. **Script Logic**:\n   - Use `awk` to process the `book_years.txt` file and extract the book title and year.\n   - Use `sed` to insert the publication year into the correct `<td>` tag in the HTML file.\n\n3. **Shell Script**:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# File paths\nhtml_file=\"books.html\"\nyear_file=\"book_years.txt\"\n\n# Read the year data and update the HTML file\nwhile IFS=: read -r title year; do\n  # Escape any special characters in the title for sed (if necessary)\n  escaped_title=$(echo \"$title\" | sed 's/[&/\\]/\\\\&/g')\n\n  # Use sed to insert the year into the correct position\n  sed -i \"/<td>$escaped_title<\\/td>/!b;n;n;c <td>$year<\\/td>\" \"$html_file\"\ndone < \"$year_file\"\n```\n\n4. **Explanation**:\n   - The script loops through each line of the `book_years.txt` file, splitting the line into `title` and `year`.\n   - It uses `sed` to search for the book title in the HTML file and moves two lines down (past the author name `<td>` tag) to replace the empty `<td>` tag with the publication year.\n\n5. **Run the Script**:\n   - Make sure your HTML file (`books.html`) and `book_years.txt` are in the same directory as the script.\n   - Give execute permissions to the script: `chmod +x update_table.sh`\n   - Run the script: `./update_table.sh`\n\nThis will update your HTML table with the publication year for each book. Adjust the file names and paths as necessary for your environment."
