        "content": "To enhance the provided Python code to obtain the complete frequency spectrum of a sound wave captured at a depth of 1000 meters, you need to perform a Fourier Transform on the sound wave data. This involves reading the sound wave data, applying the Fourier Transform using a library like NumPy, and then plotting the frequency spectrum using a library like Matplotlib. Below are the steps and the Python code to achieve this:\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Read the Sound Wave Data**: Ensure you have the sound wave data in a format that can be processed, such as a NumPy array.\n\n2. **Apply Fourier Transform**: Use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) from the NumPy library to convert the time-domain signal into the frequency-domain.\n\n3. **Calculate Frequency Spectrum**: Compute the frequency bins to understand what each index in the FFT output represents in terms of frequency.\n\n4. **Plot the Frequency Spectrum**: Use Matplotlib to plot the magnitude of the FFT result against the frequency bins to visualize the frequency spectrum.\n\n### Python Code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Assuming `sound_wave` is a NumPy array representing the sound wave data\n# For demonstration, let's simulate a sound wave with random data\nsampling_frequency = 44100  # Sampling frequency in Hz\nduration = 10  # Duration in seconds\ntime = np.linspace(0, duration, int(sampling_frequency * duration), endpoint=False)\nsound_wave = np.random.randn(len(time))  # Simulated sound wave data\n\n# 1. Apply Fourier Transform\nfrequency_spectrum = np.fft.fft(sound_wave)\n\n# 2. Calculate Frequency Bins\nn = len(sound_wave)\nfrequency_bins = np.fft.fftfreq(n, d=1/sampling_frequency)\n\n# 3. Plot the Frequency Spectrum\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\nplt.plot(frequency_bins[:n // 2], np.abs(frequency_spectrum[:n // 2]) * 2 / n)\nplt.title(\"Frequency Spectrum\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Frequency (Hz)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Magnitude\")\nplt.grid()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Sound Wave Data**: The variable `sound_wave` is simulated as a random noise for demonstration purposes. In practice, this would be your actual recorded sound wave data.\n\n- **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**: `np.fft.fft(sound_wave)` computes the FFT of the sound wave, converting it from time-domain to frequency-domain.\n\n- **Frequency Bins**: `np.fft.fftfreq(n, d=1/sampling_frequency)` calculates the frequency bins, which are necessary to map the FFT output to actual frequencies.\n\n- **Plotting**: We plot only the positive frequencies (first half of the FFT result) and scale the magnitude by `2/n` to normalize the amplitude.\n\nThis code will provide you with a complete frequency spectrum of the sound wave, allowing you to analyze the different frequency components present in the sound captured at the specified depth."
