Here's a simple example of how you can extract the date from the string:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Your input string\ninput_string = \"monkey 2010-07-10 love banana\"\n\n# Regular expression pattern to match a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD\ndate_pattern = r'\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}'\n\n# Use re.search to find the first occurrence of the date pattern\nmatch = re.search(date_pattern, input_string)\n\n# Check if a match was found and extract the date\nif match:\n    date = match.group()\n    print(\"Extracted Date:\", date)\nelse:\n    print(\"No date found in the string.\")\n```\n\nIn this example, `\\d{4}` matches four digits (the year), `\\d{2}` matches two digits (the month and day), and the hyphens `-` are used as literal characters to match the date format. The `re.search` function searches the string for the first occurrence of the pattern. If a match is found, `match.group()` extracts the matched substring, which in this case is the date."
