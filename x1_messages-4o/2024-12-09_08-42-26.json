In Perl, I know a module (PDF::FromImage) that allows me to create a PDF in just 3 lines of code:\n\n```perl\nuse PDF::FromImage;\n...\nmy $pdf = PDF::FromImage->new;\n$pdf->load_images(@allPagesDir);\n$pdf->write_file($bookName . '.pdf');\n```\nI am looking for something similar in Python. I am aware of the pyPdf module, but I prefer something simpler."

        "content": "Yes, you can create a PDF from a list of image files in Python using the `Pillow` and `reportlab` libraries. Here's a straightforward way to achieve this in just a few lines of code:\n\n1. First, ensure that you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install Pillow reportlab\n   ```\n\n2. Here is a simple script to convert a list of images into a PDF:\n\n   ```python\n   from PIL import Image\n   import os\n\n   def images_to_pdf(image_files, output_pdf):\n       # Open the first image and convert it to RGB\n       first_image = Image.open(image_files[0]).convert('RGB')\n       \n       # Open the remaining images and convert them to RGB\n       image_list = [Image.open(img).convert('RGB') for img in image_files[1:]]\n       \n       # Save the images as a PDF\n       first_image.save(output_pdf, save_all=True, append_images=image_list)\n\n   # Example usage\n   all_pages_dir = ['image1.jpg', 'image2.png', 'image3.bmp'] # List your image files here\n   book_name = 'output_book.pdf'\n\n   images_to_pdf(all_pages_dir, book_name)\n   ```\n\nThis script uses the `Pillow` library to open and convert images to the RGB color space, and then saves them together as a single PDF file. The `save_all=True` and `append_images=image_list` parameters are used to append the list of images to the first image, creating a multi-page PDF. \n\nThis method is relatively simple and should meet your requirements for creating a PDF from a list of image files."
