I have a few values that I only want to be added to the parameters if their values exist, i.e., they are not `None`. For instance, I have two parameters `apple` and `orange`. How can I make `orange` optional and prevent it from being added to the parameters if its value is `None`? Here is my existing code:\n\n```python\napple = 'green'\norange = 'orange'\nparams = urllib.urlencode({\n    'apple': apple,\n    'orange': orange\n})\n```\nI want to achieve something similar to this pseudocode:\n\n```python\napple = 'green'\norange = None\nparams = urllib.urlencode({\n    'apple': apple,\n    if orange: 'orange': orange\n})\n```\nCan someone suggest how to solve this?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired behavior where optional parameters are only included if they have a value, you can dynamically construct your dictionary before using `urllib.urlencode`. You can use a dictionary comprehension to filter out any parameters that have a value of `None`. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport urllib\n\napple = 'green'\norange = None\n\n# Create a dictionary with only non-None values\nparams_dict = {\n    'apple': apple,\n    'orange': orange\n}\n\n# Use dictionary comprehension to filter out None values\nfiltered_params = {key: value for key, value in params_dict.items() if value is not None}\n\n# Encode the parameters\nparams = urllib.urlencode(filtered_params)\n\nprint(params)\n```\n\nIn this code, `params_dict` is initially created with all the parameters, and then `filtered_params` is constructed using a dictionary comprehension that includes only those key-value pairs where the value is not `None`. This way, if `orange` is `None`, it will not be included in the final result."
