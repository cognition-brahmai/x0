It works perfectly on my office computer, which runs Ubuntu 17.10, but fails to run on my home computer that operates on Linux Mint 18.3. When I attempt to run the program on my home computer, I encounter an error stating 'PortAudio library not found.' The traceback of the error is as follows:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"...path/to/my/code.py\", line 11, in <module>\n    import sounddevice as sd\n  File \"/home/arif/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sounddevice.py\", line 64, in <module>\n    raise OSError('PortAudio library not found')\nOSError: PortAudio library not found \n```\nHow can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering indicates that the PortAudio library, which is a dependency for the `sounddevice` module, is not installed on your Linux Mint 18.3 system. Here's how you can resolve the issue by installing the necessary library:\n\n1. **Install PortAudio:**\n   First, you need to install the PortAudio development files. You can do this using the package manager. Open a terminal and run the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev\n   ```\n\n   This command will install the PortAudio library and its development files, which are needed to compile Python packages that depend on it.\n\n2. **Reinstall the `sounddevice` module:**\n   After installing PortAudio, you should reinstall the `sounddevice` module to ensure it can properly detect and use the library.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall sounddevice\n   pip install sounddevice\n   ```\n\n   If you are using `conda`, you might want to install it using conda instead:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda uninstall sounddevice\n   conda install -c conda-forge python-sounddevice\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify Installation:**\n   Once you've reinstalled the `sounddevice` module, run your Python program again to check if the issue is resolved.\n\nIf you've followed these steps and the problem persists, make sure your Python environment is correctly set up and that there are no conflicts with other installations of Python or its packages. If you're using a virtual environment, ensure it's activated before installing packages."
