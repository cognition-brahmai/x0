        "content": "Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique used to convert data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. Essentially, it allows developers to interact with a relational database using the object-oriented paradigm of their programming language, rather than writing SQL queries directly.\n\nHere's a breakdown of its functionality:\n\n1. **Abstraction Layer**: ORMs provide an abstraction layer over the database, enabling developers to work with database records as if they were objects in their programming language. This abstraction simplifies data manipulation and interaction with the database.\n\n2. **Object Mapping**: ORMs map tables in a relational database to classes in a programming language. Each row in a table corresponds to an instance of that class, and each column in the table corresponds to a property of the class.\n\n3. **CRUD Operations**: ORMs typically offer built-in methods for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations, which simplify database interactions. For example, you can create a new database record by instantiating an object and calling a save method, rather than writing an INSERT SQL statement.\n\n4. **Querying**: ORMs provide a query language or methods to construct database queries using the programming language's syntax. This allows developers to retrieve data without writing raw SQL, often using methods or functions that resemble the structure of their query language.\n\n5. **Relationships**: ORMs handle relationships between tables (such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many) using object references. This allows developers to navigate related data using object properties and methods, rather than writing complex SQL joins.\n\n6. **Schema Management**: Some ORMs include tools for managing database schemas, allowing developers to define their database schema using code and automatically apply changes to the database structure (migrations).\n\n7. **Database Agnosticism**: By using an ORM, applications can often be made database-agnostic, meaning they can be switched from one database system to another with minimal changes to the codebase. This is because the ORM handles differences in SQL dialects and database features.\n\nOverall, ORMs streamline database interactions, reduce the likelihood of SQL injection attacks by using parameterized queries, and improve code readability and maintainability by allowing developers to work with database data using familiar object-oriented concepts. Popular ORM libraries include Hibernate for Java, Entity Framework for .NET, and Django ORM for Python."
