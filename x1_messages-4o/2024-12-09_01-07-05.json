However, I am unable to access the attribute of the shared object directly via the proxy. Here's the code I am working with:\n\n```python\nfrom multiprocessing.managers import BaseManager\n\nclass TestClass:\n    def __init__(self, a):\n        self.a = a\n    def b(self):\n        print self.a\n\nclass MyManager(BaseManager): pass\n\nMyManager.register('test', TestClass)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    manager = MyManager()\n    manager.start()\n    t = TestClass(1)\n    print t.a\n    mt = manager.test(2)\n    mt.b()\n    mt.a\n```\n\nWhen I run the code, I get the following error:\n\n```python\n1\n2\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"multiprocess_example_stackexchange.py\", line 20, in &lt;module&gt;\n    mt.a \nAttributeError: 'AutoProxy[test]' object has no attribute 'a'\n```\n\nIs the only way to access the attribute using a method that gets the attribute, or am I doing something wrong?"

        "content": "In the code you are working with, the issue arises because the `AutoProxy` object, which is returned by the manager, does not directly expose the attributes of the original object. Instead, it provides access to the methods of the object. This is a common pattern when using multiprocessing and managers to ensure that objects can be safely shared between processes.\n\nTo access an attribute of the shared object, you would typically need to add a method to your class that returns the attribute value. Here's how you can modify your `TestClass` to include a method for accessing the attribute `a`:\n\n```python\nfrom multiprocessing.managers import BaseManager\n\nclass TestClass:\n    def __init__(self, a):\n        self.a = a\n    \n    def b(self):\n        print(self.a)\n\n    # Method to get the value of 'a'\n    def get_a(self):\n        return self.a\n\nclass MyManager(BaseManager):\n    pass\n\nMyManager.register('test', TestClass)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    manager = MyManager()\n    manager.start()\n    \n    t = TestClass(1)\n    print(t.a)\n    \n    mt = manager.test(2)\n    mt.b()\n\n    # Use the method to access the attribute\n    print(mt.get_a())\n```\n\nWith this change, the `get_a` method allows you to access the value of `a` through the proxy. When you run this modified code, you should see the following output:\n\n```\n1\n2\n2\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that the attribute is accessed in a way that is compatible with the multiprocessing manager's proxy objects."
