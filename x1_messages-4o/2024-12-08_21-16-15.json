        "content": "Certainly! You can use Python's `re` module to create a regular expression pattern that matches the word \"dog\" in the phrase. Here's a simple example:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# The phrase to search in\nphrase = \"Please walk the dog\"\n\n# Regular expression pattern to match the word \"dog\"\npattern = r'\\bdog\\b'\n\n# Use re.search to find the match\nmatch = re.search(pattern, phrase)\n\nif match:\n    print(\"Matched word:\", match.group())\n    print(\"Index position:\", match.start())\nelse:\n    print(\"No match found.\")\n```\n\nIn this code, the pattern `\\bdog\\b` is used, where `\\b` represents a word boundary. This ensures that we only match the whole word \"dog\" and not just part of another word. When you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\nMatched word: dog\nIndex position: 15\n```\n\nSo, the word \"dog\" is matched, and its starting index position in the phrase is 15."
