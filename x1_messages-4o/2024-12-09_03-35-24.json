I have many fields and I do not want to set defaults, which don't make sense in my case. If I don't set defaults, it returns an error because it appears to save the object immediately. Setting the fields to `null=True` is not an option for me as I do not want null fields. Is there another method or an extra parameter that I can send to `get_or_create()` so that it creates an object but does not save it until I call `save()` on it?"

        "content": "The `get_or_create()` method in Django is designed to either retrieve an existing object or create a new one, and it does so by saving the new object to the database immediately if it doesn't already exist. This behavior is intrinsic to the method, and there isn't an option to create the object without saving it right away. This is because `get_or_create()` is intended to ensure that the object exists in the database after the call, whether it was retrieved or created.\n\nIf you want to create an object without saving it immediately, you'll need to manage this process manually. Here's how you might approach it:\n\n1. **Query for the Object:**\n   First, try to retrieve the object using a regular query. If it exists, you can use it directly.\n\n2. **Create Without Saving:**\n   If the object doesn't exist, you can create an instance of your model without saving it immediately. This allows you to set all the fields you need before saving.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom myapp.models import MyModel\n\n# Define your unique lookup fields\nlookup_params = {'field1': value1, 'field2': value2}\n\n# Attempt to retrieve the object\nobj = MyModel.objects.filter(**lookup_params).first()\n\nif not obj:\n    # If not found, create an instance without saving\n    obj = MyModel(**lookup_params)\n    # Now, set other required fields\n    obj.other_field1 = 'value'\n    obj.other_field2 = 'value'\n    # Finally, save the object\n    obj.save()\n\n# Use the object as needed\n```\n\nThis approach gives you more control over when the object is saved, allowing you to set all necessary fields before calling `save()`. By using `filter().first()`, you avoid the `DoesNotExist` exception and can handle the absence of an object gracefully."
