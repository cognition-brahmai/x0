        "content": "To split a large string separated by \"\\r\\n\" into a list of lines in Python, you can use the `split` method of a string. The `split` method allows you to specify a delimiter, and it will return a list of substrings. In your case, you can use `\"\\r\\n\"` as the delimiter. Here is how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\n# Example command that produces output\ncommand = [\"echo\", \"line1\\r\\nline2\\r\\nline3\"]\n\n# Run the command and capture the output\nprocess = subprocess.Popen(command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)\nstdout, stderr = process.communicate()\n\n# Split the output into lines using \"\\r\\n\" as the delimiter\nlines = stdout.split(\"\\r\\n\")\n\n# Print the resulting list of lines\nprint(lines)\n```\n\nThis code runs a command using `subprocess.Popen` and splits the output `stdout` by the delimiter `\"\\r\\n\"` to create a list of lines. Note that `text=True` in `Popen` ensures that the output is interpreted as text and not bytes. If you are using a different method to obtain the string, just replace `stdout` with your string variable."
