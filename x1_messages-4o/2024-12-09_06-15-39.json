Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Sample data\ndata = {'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'B': [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Create a plot\nax = df.plot()\n\n# Hide the x-axis label\nax.xaxis.label.set_visible(False)\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this example, `ax.xaxis.label.set_visible(False)` specifically targets the x-axis label and makes it invisible, while keeping the rest of the x-axis intact. This way, you maintain the axis and its ticks without displaying the label text."
