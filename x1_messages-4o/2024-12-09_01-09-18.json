However, when I use `Pool.map` with a lambda function as shown below:\n\n```python\np = Pool(12)\np.map(lambda x: copy_file(x,target_dir), file_list)\n```\n\nI encounter an issue because lambda functions can't be pickled, causing the operation to fail. What is an efficient and Pythonic way to address this issue?"

        "content": "To address the issue with using a lambda function in `Pool.map`, you can define a regular function instead of a lambda. The `Pool.map` function requires the function to be picklable, and lambda functions are not picklable in Python. Here's how you can modify your code to make it work:\n\n1. Define a separate function that takes a single argument and calls `copy_file` with the appropriate parameters.\n2. Use this function with `Pool.map`.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom multiprocessing import Pool\n\ndef copy_file_wrapper(source_file):\n    # Call the copy_file function with the target_dir\n    copy_file(source_file, target_dir)\n\n# Assume target_dir and file_list are defined somewhere above this point\np = Pool(12)\np.map(copy_file_wrapper, file_list)\np.close()\np.join()\n```\n\nIn this setup, `copy_file_wrapper` is a regular function, which can be pickled and used with `Pool.map`. This should resolve the issue and allow you to perform the operation concurrently. Additionally, don't forget to close the pool and join it to ensure that all processes complete before the program continues."
