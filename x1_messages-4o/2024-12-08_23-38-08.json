A concise version of the sentence could be: \"The local government will decide on building a new road.\"\n\n### \\LaTeX Method:\nHere is how you can write the reduced sentence in \\LaTeX:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\begin{document}\n\nThe local government will decide on building a new road.\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n### Automating Sentence Reduction with Python:\n\nTo automate sentence reduction, you can use Python packages like `nltk` or `spacy` for natural language processing, along with some custom rules for simplification. However, for more advanced sentence reduction, you might consider using a transformer-based model from the `transformers` library, such as BERT or GPT, which can summarize text.\n\nHere's a basic step-by-step approach using `nltk` and `transformers`:\n\n#### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Install Required Packages:**\n\n   First, you need to install the necessary Python packages:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install nltk transformers\n   ```\n\n2. **Import Libraries:**\n\n   Import the necessary libraries in your Python script.\n\n   ```python\n   import nltk\n   from transformers import pipeline\n   ```\n\n3. **Load a Summarization Model:**\n\n   Use the `transformers` library to load a pre-trained summarization model.\n\n   ```python\n   summarizer = pipeline(\"summarization\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Summarize the Sentence:**\n\n   Pass the sentence to the summarizer and obtain the reduced version.\n\n   ```python\n   sentence = \"The local government will be making a decision on whether or not they will be building a new road.\"\n   result = summarizer(sentence, max_length=30, min_length=10, do_sample=False)\n\n   reduced_sentence = result[0]['summary_text']\n   print(\"Reduced Sentence:\", reduced_sentence)\n   ```\n\nThis code will use a pre-trained model to generate a concise version of the given sentence. The `max_length` and `min_length` parameters can be adjusted according to the desired length of the reduced sentence.\n\nThis approach leverages the power of transformer models to understand and condense the sentence while maintaining its meaning."
