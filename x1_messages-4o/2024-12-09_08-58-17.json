        "content": "Certainly! A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward as forward. Here's a simple algorithm to determine if a given word is a palindrome:\n\n1. **Input the word**: Start by taking the input word you want to check.\n\n2. **Normalize the word**: Convert the word to a consistent format by converting all letters to the same case (e.g., lowercase) to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive.\n\n3. **Reverse the word**: Reverse the string of the word.\n\n4. **Compare the original and reversed word**: Check if the original normalized word is the same as the reversed normalized word.\n\n5. **Output the result**: If they are the same, the word is a palindrome. Otherwise, it is not.\n\nHere is a simple implementation in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(word):\n    # Normalize the word by converting it to lowercase\n    normalized_word = word.lower()\n    \n    # Reverse the word\n    reversed_word = normalized_word[::-1]\n    \n    # Compare the original and reversed words\n    if normalized_word == reversed_word:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Example usage\nword = \"Racecar\"\nif is_palindrome(word):\n    print(f\"'{word}' is a palindrome.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"'{word}' is not a palindrome.\")\n```\n\nThis function will correctly determine if a given word is a palindrome by following the steps outlined above."
