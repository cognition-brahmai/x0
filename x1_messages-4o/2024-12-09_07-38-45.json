        "content": "Yes, you can dynamically set the number of decimal places in a formatted string using Python's string formatting techniques. Instead of using `%.2f`, you can incorporate a variable into the format specification to allow the user to specify the number of decimal places. Here's how you can do it using f-strings (available in Python 3.6 and later) and the `format` method:\n\n### Using f-strings\n\n```python\ndecimal_places = 3  # This can be set by the user\nnumber = 123.456789\n\nformatted_number = f\"{number:.{decimal_places}f}\"\nprint(formatted_number)  # Output: 123.457\n```\n\n### Using the `format` method\n\n```python\ndecimal_places = 3  # This can be set by the user\nnumber = 123.456789\n\nformatted_number = \"{:.{}f}\".format(number, decimal_places)\nprint(formatted_number)  # Output: 123.457\n```\n\nIn both examples, `decimal_places` is a variable that specifies the number of decimal places you want to display. You can change its value to adjust the formatting as needed."
