I want to add separate columns for each year to the original DataFrame. If the 'YEAR' value in a row is specific to a year (like 1992), then the value in the corresponding new column (1992) for that row should be 1, otherwise 0. I tried using a loop to accomplish this, but it's taking too long because my dataset is large. Can anyone help me optimize this?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can optimize this process by using the `pd.get_dummies()` function in pandas, which is specifically designed to create one-hot encoded columns efficiently. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample data\ndata = {\n    'YEAR': [1992, 1993, 1994, 1992, 1993, 1995],\n    'other_column': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]\n}\n\n# Create a DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Use get_dummies to create one-hot encoded columns for the 'YEAR' column\nyear_dummies = pd.get_dummies(df['YEAR'], prefix='', prefix_sep='')\n\n# Concatenate the new one-hot encoded columns with the original DataFrame\ndf = pd.concat([df, year_dummies], axis=1)\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThis will efficiently create a new column for each year and set values to 1 or 0 based on the presence of that year in the 'YEAR' column. The `pd.get_dummies()` function is vectorized and optimized for performance, making it much faster than using a loop, especially with large datasets."
