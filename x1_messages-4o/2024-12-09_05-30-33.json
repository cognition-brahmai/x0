        "content": "I'm learning how to use Tensorflow and Tensorboard with a test project based on the MNIST neural net tutorial. I have a node that calculates the fraction of correctly classified digits in a dataset. I evaluate the accuracy for both the training set and the validation set as training progresses and this works as expected. However, I'm unable to create different graphs for these values in Tensorboard. The logged values from scalar_summary do not distinguish between the training set and validation set. I attempted to create two identical accuracy nodes with different names and run one on the training set and one on the validation set, but the graphs show identical values that don't match the ones printed to the terminal. How do I separately log the output from a single node for different inputs?"

        "content": "To differentiate between the training set and validation set accuracies in TensorBoard, you need to ensure that each set has its own distinct summary operation and is logged separately. Here are the steps you can follow to achieve that:\n\n1. **Separate Accuracy Nodes**: Ensure you have two distinct accuracy nodes, one for the training set and another for the validation set. You may create these nodes by using the same accuracy calculation logic but with separate variable scopes or names.\n\n2. **Distinct Summary Operations**: Create separate summary operations for each accuracy node. This will help in distinguishing them in TensorBoard. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   with tf.name_scope('train'):\n       train_accuracy = # calculate train accuracy\n       train_accuracy_summary = tf.summary.scalar('train_accuracy', train_accuracy)\n\n   with tf.name_scope('validation'):\n       validation_accuracy = # calculate validation accuracy\n       validation_accuracy_summary = tf.summary.scalar('validation_accuracy', validation_accuracy)\n   ```\n\n3. **Separate Summary Writers**: Use distinct summary writers for training and validation. While it\u2019s not strictly necessary to have separate writers, it can help with organization and clarity:\n\n   ```python\n   train_writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('/path/to/logs/train', sess.graph)\n   validation_writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('/path/to/logs/validation')\n   ```\n\n4. **Log Summaries Separately**: During your training loop, ensure you evaluate and log the summaries for training and validation separately:\n\n   ```python\n   for step in range(num_steps):\n       # Training step\n       _, train_summary = sess.run([train_op, train_accuracy_summary], feed_dict={...})\n       train_writer.add_summary(train_summary, step)\n\n       # Validation step (e.g., every few steps)\n       if step % validation_interval == 0:\n           val_summary = sess.run(validation_accuracy_summary, feed_dict={...})\n           validation_writer.add_summary(val_summary, step)\n   ```\n\n5. **Flush and Close Writers**: Remember to flush and close the summary writers when they are no longer needed:\n\n   ```python\n   train_writer.flush()\n   train_writer.close()\n   validation_writer.flush()\n   validation_writer.close()\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to view separate graphs for training and validation accuracies in TensorBoard. Make sure that the paths for `FileWriter` are correct and that you're using the correct feed dictionaries for each dataset."
