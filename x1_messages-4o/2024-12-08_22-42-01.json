For instance, if I have a table called \"products\" with columns \"name\" and \"category\", how can I modify the code to retrieve the category of a given product from the database and classify it accordingly? Can you provide an example of how to connect to the database and retrieve the category data using Ruby's built-in support for SQL databases?"

        "content": "To modify a Ruby program to classify products based on multiple categories stored in an SQL database, you can use a database library like `sqlite3` or an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library such as ActiveRecord. Below is an example using the `sqlite3` gem, which is useful for connecting to an SQLite database and executing SQL queries to retrieve data.\n\nFirst, ensure you have the `sqlite3` gem installed. You can add it to your `Gemfile` or install it directly by running:\n\n```bash\ngem install sqlite3\n```\n\nNext, create a Ruby script to connect to your SQLite database, retrieve product categories, and classify products accordingly. Here's an example:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'sqlite3'\n\n# Connect to the SQLite3 database\ndb = SQLite3::Database.new 'products.db'\n\n# Create a products table if it doesn't exist\ndb.execute <<-SQL\n  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products (\n    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n    name TEXT,\n    category TEXT\n  );\nSQL\n\n# Insert sample data (if needed)\ndb.execute \"INSERT INTO products (name, category) VALUES ('Laptop', 'Electronics')\"\ndb.execute \"INSERT INTO products (name, category) VALUES ('Chair', 'Furniture')\"\ndb.execute \"INSERT INTO products (name, category) VALUES ('Sofa', 'Furniture')\"\ndb.execute \"INSERT INTO products (name, category) VALUES ('Smartphone', 'Electronics')\"\n\n# Function to classify products based on category\ndef classify_products(db)\n  # Execute a SQL query to retrieve all products\n  db.execute(\"SELECT name, category FROM products\") do |row|\n    name, category = row\n    puts \"Product: #{name}, Category: #{category}\"\n  end\nend\n\n# Call the function\nclassify_products(db)\n\n# Close the database connection\ndb.close\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Database Connection**: We establish a connection to the SQLite database (`products.db`).\n\n2. **Table Creation**: We ensure the `products` table exists, with columns `name` and `category`.\n\n3. **Insert Sample Data**: Insert sample product data into the database. You can skip this step if your database is already populated.\n\n4. **Classify Products**: The `classify_products` method executes a SQL query to fetch all products and their categories, then prints each product with its category.\n\n5. **Close Connection**: Finally, we close the database connection to free up resources.\n\nThis script demonstrates a simple way to classify products based on categories stored in an SQL database using Ruby. You can adapt it to connect to different types of SQL databases (like MySQL or PostgreSQL) by using the appropriate Ruby gems and modifying the connection settings accordingly."
