I have written a simple program where I am passing two numbers as command line arguments and trying to add them. However, the output is not as expected. The numbers are being concatenated instead of being added. Here's the code I have written:\n\n```\nimport sys\n\na = sys.argv[1]\nb = sys.argv[2]\n\nprint a, b\n\nprint a+b\n```\n\nWhen I input `python mySum.py 100 200`, the output I get is `100 200` and `100200`. It seems the numbers are being interpreted as strings. How can I interpret them as numerics?"

        "content": "In Python, command line arguments are passed as strings by default. This is why when you try to add them, they are being concatenated instead of being summed up as numbers. To perform arithmetic operations, you need to convert these string arguments to integers or floats first, depending on your requirement.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to convert the command line arguments to integers before adding them:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Convert the arguments from strings to integers\na = int(sys.argv[1])\nb = int(sys.argv[2])\n\nprint(a, b)\n\n# Add the integers\nprint(a + b)\n```\n\nIf you expect that the input might be a float, you can use `float()` instead of `int()`:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Convert the arguments from strings to floats\na = float(sys.argv[1])\nb = float(sys.argv[2])\n\nprint(a, b)\n\n# Add the floats\nprint(a + b)\n```\n\nThis should give you the expected numeric addition instead of concatenation."
