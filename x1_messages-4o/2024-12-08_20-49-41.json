        "content": "To rank a list of items from highest to lowest, you can use a simple sorting algorithm. Here's a basic algorithm using the bubble sort method, which is easy to understand and implement:\n\n1. Start with the list of items: {5000, 1800, 9001, 1100, 67}.\n\n2. Set a flag to indicate whether a swap has been made. Initialize it to `True`.\n\n3. While the flag is `True`, repeat steps 4 to 7:\n   - Set the flag to `False` (this assumes no swaps will be made).\n   \n4. Loop through the list from the first item to the second-last item:\n   - Compare each pair of adjacent items.\n   \n5. If the current item is less than the next item:\n   - Swap them.\n   - Set the flag to `True` (indicating a swap was made).\n   \n6. Continue this process until you reach the end of the list.\n\n7. If no swaps were made in the entire loop, the list is sorted, and you can stop.\n\n8. The list is now sorted from highest to lowest.\n\nApplying this algorithm to the given list step-by-step:\n\n- Initial list: {5000, 1800, 9001, 1100, 67}\n- After first pass: {5000, 9001, 1800, 1100, 67}\n- After second pass: {9001, 5000, 1800, 1100, 67}\n\nThe list is now sorted in descending order: {9001, 5000, 1800, 1100, 67}."
