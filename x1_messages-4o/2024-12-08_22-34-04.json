Mathematically, this is represented as:\n\n\\[ x^3 = 125 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we take the cube root of both sides:\n\n\\[ x = \\sqrt[3]{125} \\]\n\n125 is a perfect cube, as it can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ 125 = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^3 \\]\n\nThus, the cube root of 125 is 5. Therefore, the smallest integer is 5."
