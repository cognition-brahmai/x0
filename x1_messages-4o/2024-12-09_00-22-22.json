        "content": "In Python, you can achieve encapsulation by using a naming convention and defining the method with a leading underscore. While Python doesn't have strict access modifiers like C++, using an underscore is a common practice to indicate that a method or attribute is intended for internal use only. This is more of a convention and doesn't enforce strict access restrictions.\n\nHere's how you can define a method within a class for internal use:\n\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n    def public_method(self):\n        print(\"This is a public method.\")\n        self._internal_method()\n\n    def _internal_method(self):\n        print(\"This is an internal method, not intended for public use.\")\n```\n\nIn this example, `_internal_method` is intended to be used only within the class and is indicated as such by the leading underscore.\n\nRegarding your second question, if you wish to define a method that doesn't require access to `self` (i.e., it doesn't need to access or modify instance attributes), you can use a `staticmethod`. A static method doesn't take `self` as a parameter and can be called on the class itself rather than an instance of the class.\n\nHere's how you can define a static method:\n\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n    @staticmethod\n    def _internal_static_method():\n        print(\"This is an internal static method.\")\n\n    def public_method(self):\n        print(\"This is a public method.\")\n        MyClass._internal_static_method()\n```\n\nIn this example, `_internal_static_method` is a static method that can be called without an instance of the class and is marked with a leading underscore to suggest it is for internal use only.\n\nTo answer your query, yes, it is possible to use a function without any decorators and without `self` by simply defining it outside the class or as a static method within the class. However, defining it within the class using the static method decorator keeps it organized and associated with the class itself."
