Do I need to change my working directory to the folder I downloaded? Can I add this to my `tensorflow` directory and if so, where should I add the files? Are these files meant to be accessed directly through `tensorflow` like `sklearn` datasets? Or am I supposed to navigate into the directory and work from there?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to how you're trying to import the `input_data` module. The `input_data.py` script is not a part of the official TensorFlow library; rather, it's a utility script that was commonly used in older TensorFlow tutorials to load the MNIST dataset. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n### Steps to Resolve the Issue:\n\n1. **Check the Download Location:**\n   Ensure that the `input_data.py` file is located in the same directory as your Jupyter Notebook, or in a directory that's included in your Python path. If it's not, you'll need to adjust its location.\n\n2. **Place `input_data.py` in Your Working Directory:**\n   If you haven't already, download the `input_data.py` file from the TensorFlow GitHub repository or any reliable source, and place it in the same directory where your Jupyter Notebook file is located.\n\n3. **Update the Import Statement:**\n   If `input_data.py` is in the same directory as your Jupyter Notebook, your import statement should work as is:\n   ```python\n   import input_data\n   mnist = input_data.read_data_sets(\"MNIST_data/\", one_hot=True)\n   ```\n\n4. **Alternative: Use `tensorflow_datasets`:**\n   If you're using a more recent version of TensorFlow, consider using `tensorflow_datasets`, which provides a more modern and integrated way to load datasets like MNIST:\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow_datasets as tfds\n\n   # Load MNIST data\n   mnist, mnist_info = tfds.load('mnist', with_info=True, as_supervised=True)\n   ```\n\n5. **Ensure TensorFlow is Installed:**\n   Verify that TensorFlow is correctly installed in your environment. You can do this by running:\n   ```sh\n   pip show tensorflow\n   ```\n\n6. **Check Python Path:**\n   If you're still having issues, check that the directory containing `input_data.py` is in your Python path. You can append it to the path within your Jupyter Notebook like this:\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   sys.path.append('/path/to/directory/with/input_data')\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to import and use the `input_data` module successfully.
