I have a line of code `label = re.sub(\"([A-Z])\",\" \\g<0>\",label)` which does this transformation successfully. However, I am encountering issues with inputs like 'simpleBigURL' which should ideally be converted to 'simple Big URL'. I attempted a solution with the code `label = re.sub(\"([a-z])([A-Z])\",\"\\g<0> \\g<1>\",label)` but it produced incorrect results like 'divLineColor' being converted to 'divL vineC eolor'. I also considered using the `(?!...)` syntax but haven't had any success. Can you suggest a solution that would correctly handle such cases and also take acronyms into account?"

        "content": "To handle the conversion of camel case to space-separated words while also considering acronyms, we need to use a regular expression that correctly identifies the boundaries between lowercase and uppercase letters without separating acronyms into individual letters. Here's a solution that should work for your requirements:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef camel_case_to_space_separated(label):\n    # Use a regular expression to insert spaces before capital letters\n    # We handle acronyms by looking for a lowercase letter followed by an uppercase letter\n    label = re.sub(r'(?<=[a-z])(?=[A-Z])', ' ', label)\n\n    # Handle special case where there are consecutive uppercase letters (acronyms)\n    # We insert a space only before a sequence of uppercase letters followed by a lowercase letter\n    label = re.sub(r'(?<=[A-Z])(?=[A-Z][a-z])', ' ', label)\n\n    return label\n\n# Test cases\nprint(camel_case_to_space_separated('divLineColor'))  # Output: 'div Line Color'\nprint(camel_case_to_space_separated('simpleBigURL'))  # Output: 'simple Big URL'\nprint(camel_case_to_space_separated('HTTPResponseCode'))  # Output: 'HTTP Response Code'\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **First Regex (`(?<=[a-z])(?=[A-Z])`)**:\n   - This looks for a transition from a lowercase letter to an uppercase letter and inserts a space. This handles the standard camel case transition.\n\n2. **Second Regex (`(?<=[A-Z])(?=[A-Z][a-z])`)**:\n   - This looks for an uppercase letter followed by another uppercase letter and then a lowercase letter. This is used to handle acronyms, ensuring that we insert a space before an acronym when it is followed by something that isn't part of the acronym.\n\nUsing these two regular expressions together will give you the desired separation for camel case strings while preserving acronyms as single entities without splitting them into separate characters."
