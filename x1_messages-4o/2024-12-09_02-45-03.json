For instance, if I wanted to run a command like `cat file.log | tail -1`, how could I achieve this? In Perl, I could do it as follows: `my $string = `cat file.log | tail -1`;`. I want to know the equivalent operation in Python."

        "content": "In Python, you can execute shell commands and capture their output using the `subprocess` module. This module provides a more flexible way of running shell commands compared to older methods like `os.system`. Here's how you can run a command with a pipe and capture its output:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\n# Define the command and pipe it\ncommand = \"cat file.log | tail -1\"\n\n# Use subprocess to execute the command\nresult = subprocess.run(command, shell=True, capture_output=True, text=True)\n\n# Capture the output\noutput = result.stdout.strip()\n\n# Print the captured output\nprint(output)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **subprocess.run**: This function is used to run the shell command. The `shell=True` parameter allows you to execute the command as if it were run in the shell, which is necessary when using pipes.\n\n2. **capture_output=True**: This argument tells `subprocess.run` to capture both standard output and standard error.\n\n3. **text=True**: This argument ensures that the output is returned as a string instead of bytes.\n\n4. **result.stdout.strip()**: This extracts the standard output from the result object and removes any leading or trailing whitespace, such as newlines.\n\nBy using `subprocess.run`, you can effectively execute shell commands with pipes in Python and capture their output just like you would in Perl."
