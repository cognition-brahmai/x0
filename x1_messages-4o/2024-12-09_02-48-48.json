The view that I'm using checks if the request method is POST and if the form is valid, then it retrieves the cleaned_data from the form.

Can someone help me figure out what's going wrong?\n\n<pre><code>SearchForm model:\nfrom django import forms\nfrom django.forms import CharField, ModelMultipleChoiceField, ModelChoiceField\nfrom books.models import Book, Author, Category\n\nclass SearchForm(forms.ModelForm):\n    authors = ModelMultipleChoiceField(queryset=Author.objects.all(),required=False)    \n    category = ModelChoiceField (queryset=Category.objects.all(),required=False)\n    class Meta:\n        model = Book\n        fields = [\"title\"]\n\nView:\nfrom django.shortcuts import render_to_response, redirect, get_object_or_404\nfrom django.template import RequestContext\nfrom books.models import Book,Author\nfrom books.forms import BookForm, SearchForm\nfrom users.models import User\n\ndef search_book(request):\n    if request.method == \"POST\":\n        form = SearchForm(request.POST)\n        if form.is_valid():\n            form = SearchForm(request.POST)\n            stitle = form.cleaned_data['title']\n            sauthor = form.cleaned_data['author']\n            scategory = form.cleaned_data['category']\n    else:\n        form = SearchForm()\n    return render_to_response(\"books/create.html\", {\n        \"form\": form,\n    }, context_instance=RequestContext(request))\n</code></pre>"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely due to the way the `SearchForm` is implemented and used in your view. It seems there are a few points to address:\n\n1. **Form Initialization**: In your view, it looks like you are initializing the form twice. You only need to initialize it once with `request.POST` when the request method is `POST`.\n\n2. **Field Names**: The error in your code is because you are trying to access `cleaned_data` for a field `author`, but the field you defined in the form is named `authors`. Similarly, you should ensure that the field names you access in `cleaned_data` match those defined in the form.\n\n3. **Using `ModelForm`**: While using `ModelForm`, the form is tied to a model. Since the `SearchForm` seems to be more of a filter form rather than a full model form, it might be better to use `forms.Form` instead of `forms.ModelForm` unless you have a specific reason to tie it to the `Book` model.\n\nHere's a revised version of your form and view:\n\n**Revised SearchForm:**\n```python\nfrom django import forms\nfrom django.forms import CharField, ModelMultipleChoiceField, ModelChoiceField\nfrom books.models import Book, Author, Category\n\nclass SearchForm(forms.Form):\n    title = CharField(required=False)\n    authors = ModelMultipleChoiceField(queryset=Author.objects.all(), required=False)    \n    category = ModelChoiceField(queryset=Category.objects.all(), required=False)\n```\n\n**Revised View:**\n```python\nfrom django.shortcuts import render\nfrom books.forms import SearchForm\n\ndef search_book(request):\n    if request.method == \"POST\":\n        form = SearchForm(request.POST)\n        if form.is_valid():\n            stitle = form.cleaned_data['title']\n            sauthors = form.cleaned_data['authors']\n            scategory = form.cleaned_data['category']\n            # Implement your search functionality here using stitle, sauthors, and scategory\n    else:\n        form = SearchForm()\n    \n    return render(request, \"books/create.html\", {\"form\": form})\n```\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n- Make sure your template `create.html` is correctly rendering the form and handling form submission.\n- Ensure that the field names in your form match those used in `cleaned_data`.\n- Adjust your search logic to handle the list of authors in `sauthors` appropriately, since it is a `ModelMultipleChoiceField`.\n\nThis setup should help resolve the issue you faced with accessing the `cleaned_data` from your form."
