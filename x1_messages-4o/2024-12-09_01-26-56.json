I am trying to define a basic function named `pyth_test` in Python which takes two arguments and prints their sum. However, when I try to run this function with the arguments 1 and 2 in the interpreter, I encounter a `NameError` stating that 'pyth_test' is not defined. Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\ndef pyth_test (x1, x2):\n    print x1 + x2\n```\n\nAlso, I have the script containing this function saved as `pyth.py`, but still, I am not able to call the function. Can anyone help me understand what I am doing wrong and how to correctly define and use functions in Python?"

        "content": "It looks like you're on the right track with defining a function in Python, but there are a few key points to address to resolve the `NameError` and ensure your function works correctly.\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions:\n\n1. **Syntax for Print Statement:**\n   - In Python 2, `print` is a statement, so your code `print x1 + x2` is valid. However, in Python 3, `print` is a function, so you need to use parentheses: `print(x1 + x2)`.\n\n2. **Running the Script:**\n   - If you're trying to run the function from a Python interpreter or script, ensure that you have executed the script where the function is defined. Make sure you are in the correct directory where `pyth.py` is located.\n\n3. **Calling the Function:**\n   - After defining the function, you need to call it by using the function name followed by parentheses and arguments. For example: `pyth_test(1, 2)`.\n\n4. **Importing the Function:**\n   - If you have your function in a separate file (i.e., `pyth.py`), you need to import it into your working environment. Here's how you can do it:\n\n   ```python\n   # In your interpreter or another script\n   from pyth import pyth_test\n\n   # Now you can call the function\n   pyth_test(1, 2)\n   ```\n\n### Complete Example:\n\nHere's how you can structure your code and run your function:\n\n1. **Define the Function in `pyth.py`:**\n\n   ```python\n   # pyth.py\n   def pyth_test(x1, x2):\n       print(x1 + x2)\n   ```\n\n2. **Run the Function:**\n\n   - **From the Interpreter:**\n\n     ```python\n     >>> from pyth import pyth_test\n     >>> pyth_test(1, 2)\n     3\n     ```\n\n   - **Or, within the same script after the function definition:**\n\n     ```python\n     def pyth_test(x1, x2):\n         print(x1 + x2)\n\n     # Call the function\n     pyth_test(1, 2)\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to define and run your function successfully without encountering a `NameError`. Make sure you're using the correct Python version and syntax as per your environment."
