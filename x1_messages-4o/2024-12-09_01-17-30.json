This is because pip will change the way that it resolves dependency conflicts. We recommend you use --use-feature=2020-resolver to test your packages with the new resolver before it becomes the default. jsonschema 3.2.0 requires six>=1.11.0, but you'll have six 1.10.0 which is incompatible.\" I'm not sure what this error message means or how to resolve it.

        "content": "The error message you're encountering is related to a package dependency issue in Python's package manager, `pip`. This is particularly common when installing packages like Jupyter that have multiple dependencies. Let's break down the issue and see how you can resolve it:\n\n1. **Understanding the Error**: \n   - The message indicates that the `jsonschema` package requires a version of the `six` package that is `>=1.11.0`, but you currently have `six` version `1.10.0` installed. This version conflict is what triggers the error message.\n\n2. **Solution**:\n   You can resolve this issue by upgrading the `six` package to a compatible version. Here are the steps you can follow:\n\n   - **Upgrade pip**: First, ensure that you have the latest version of `pip`, as newer versions handle dependencies better.\n\n     ```bash\n     pip install --upgrade pip\n     ```\n\n   - **Upgrade the `six` package**: Upgrade the `six` package to a version that meets the requirements of `jsonschema`.\n\n     ```bash\n     pip install --upgrade six\n     ```\n\n   - **Install Jupyter**: After upgrading `six`, try installing Jupyter again.\n\n     ```bash\n     pip install jupyter\n     ```\n\n3. **Using the 2020 Resolver**:\n   - The error message also suggests using the `--use-feature=2020-resolver` flag. You can try installing Jupyter with this flag to see if it helps resolve the dependencies automatically.\n\n     ```bash\n     pip install --use-feature=2020-resolver jupyter\n     ```\n\n4. **Check for Other Conflicts**:\n   - If the above steps don't resolve the issue, there might be other package conflicts. You can use the `pip check` command to identify any other dependency issues.\n\n     ```bash\n     pip check\n     ```\n\n5. **Using Virtual Environments**:\n   - To avoid such issues in the future, consider using a virtual environment. This allows you to manage dependencies for different projects separately.\n\n     ```bash\n     python3 -m venv myenv\n     source myenv/bin/activate\n     ```\n\n   - After activating the virtual environment, repeat the installation steps within it.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the dependency conflict and successfully install Jupyter on your Ubuntu server."
