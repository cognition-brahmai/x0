I prefer a solution that doesn't require updating this module since my code will run on a server where I don't have full admin rights."

        "content": "In Python, the `os.system()` function executes a command in a subshell, but it doesn't capture the output of the command. Instead, it returns the exit status of the command. To capture the output of a system command as a string, you can use the `subprocess` module, which provides more powerful facilities for spawning new processes and retrieving their results.\n\nSince you mentioned that you are using an older version of `subprocess` that doesn't have `check_output`, you can use `subprocess.Popen` along with `communicate()` to achieve the same result. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\n# Create a Popen object to execute the command\nprocess = subprocess.Popen(['ls'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)\n\n# Capture the output and error (if any)\nstdout, stderr = process.communicate()\n\n# Decode the output from bytes to string\noutput = stdout.decode('utf-8')\n\n# Print or use the output as needed\nprint(output)\n```\n\nIn this example, `subprocess.Popen` is used to execute the `ls` command. The `stdout=subprocess.PIPE` and `stderr=subprocess.PIPE` arguments are used to capture the standard output and standard error. The `communicate()` method reads the output and error, and returns them as byte strings, which you then decode to a regular string using `.decode('utf-8')`.\n\nThis approach should work on older versions of Python as well, and it doesn't require updating the `subprocess` module."
