        "content": "Certainly! You can accomplish this task using a simple shell script. Below is a sample script that navigates into a specified directory, executes a command on each file, and concatenates the output into one large output file. This script assumes you are using a Unix-like operating system (Linux or macOS) with Bash.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Define the directory containing the files\nDIRECTORY=\"/path/to/your/directory\"\n\n# Define the command and options you want to run on each file\nCMD=\"your_command\"\nOPTIONS=\"your_options\"\n\n# Define the output file where all results will be concatenated\nOUTPUT_FILE=\"final_output.txt\"\n\n# Check if the output file already exists and remove it to avoid appending to old data\nif [ -f \"$OUTPUT_FILE\" ]; then\n  rm \"$OUTPUT_FILE\"\nfi\n\n# Navigate to the specified directory\ncd \"$DIRECTORY\" || { echo \"Failed to navigate to directory: $DIRECTORY\"; exit 1; }\n\n# Loop over each file in the directory\nfor FILE in *; do\n  # Check if it's a regular file\n  if [ -f \"$FILE\" ]; then\n    # Execute the command on the file and append the result to the output file\n    $CMD $OPTIONS \"$FILE\" >> \"../$OUTPUT_FILE\"\n  fi\ndone\n\necho \"All files have been processed and results are saved in: $OUTPUT_FILE\"\n```\n\n### How to Use the Script:\n\n1. **Replace `/path/to/your/directory`** with the path to the directory containing the files you want to process.\n\n2. **Replace `your_command`** with the actual command you wish to execute on each file.\n\n3. **Replace `your_options`** with any options needed for the command. If no options are needed, you can leave this as an empty string.\n\n4. **Replace `final_output.txt`** with your desired output file name. Ensure it's a path where you have write permissions.\n\n5. Save the script to a file, for example, `process_files.sh`.\n\n6. Make the script executable by running `chmod +x process_files.sh`.\n\n7. Execute the script by running `./process_files.sh`.\n\nThis will process each file in the specified directory using the command you defined, and output the results to `final_output.txt`. Make sure to adjust permissions and paths as needed for your specific environment."
