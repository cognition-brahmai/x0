But running the file from within my terminal with `python3 test.py` works just fine. Can anyone tell me what the problem is when running it from within VS Code?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering isn't related to the content of your Python script, which appears to be syntactically correct. Instead, it's likely a configuration problem with how Visual Studio Code is set up to run Python scripts.\n\nHere are some steps to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Python Path in VS Code:**\n   - Make sure that Visual Studio Code is using the correct Python interpreter. You can check this by looking at the bottom-left corner of the VS Code window. It should display the Python version being used.\n   - If it's incorrect, click on the Python version and select the correct interpreter from the list that appears.\n\n2. **Configure the Python Extension:**\n   - Ensure that the Python extension for VS Code is installed and updated to the latest version. You can check this in the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS).\n\n3. **Check the Launch Configuration:**\n   - Open the `.vscode/launch.json` file in your project directory if it exists. Ensure that it is configured correctly to point to your Python file. You can set up a configuration by navigating to the \"Run and Debug\" tab and clicking on \"create a launch.json file\".\n\n4. **Terminal Settings:**\n   - Sometimes the integrated terminal in VS Code could be misconfigured. You can try resetting it. Go to `View > Terminal` and then click on the trash icon to kill the terminal. Open a new terminal and try running the script again.\n\n5. **Use Code Runner Extension:**\n   - If you have the Code Runner extension installed, it might interfere with how Python scripts are executed. You can disable it temporarily to see if that's causing the issue.\n\n6. **Environment Variables:**\n   - Ensure environment variables are set correctly. If you are using a virtual environment, make sure it is activated in VS Code.\n\nTry these steps, and hopefully, the issue will be resolved. If the problem persists, consider reinstalling the Python extension or VS Code itself to ensure a fresh setup."
