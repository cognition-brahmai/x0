        "content": "In Python, the `finally` block is designed to execute code regardless of whether an exception was raised in the `try` block or not. However, the `finally` block itself doesn't have direct access to the exception information. To access the exception information in the `finally` block, you need to capture the exception in the `except` block and store it in a variable that the `finally` block can access. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Some code that may raise an exception\n    x = 1 / 0\nexcept Exception as e:\n    # Capture the exception in a variable\n    exception_message = str(e)\nfinally:\n    # Access the captured exception message in the finally block\n    if 'exception_message' in locals():\n        print(\"An exception occurred:\", exception_message)\n    else:\n        print(\"No exception occurred.\")\n```\n\nIn this example, if an exception occurs, it is caught by the `except` block, and the exception message is stored in the variable `exception_message`. The `finally` block can then access this variable to print the exception message. If no exception occurs, the `finally` block will simply print that no exception occurred."
