I tried with the following code:\n\n```python\ndef remove_newlines(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    >>> remove_newlines(\"line1 \\n\"\n    ...                 \"still line 1\\r\"\n    ...                 \"now line2 \\n\"\n    ...                 \"more line2\\n\")\n    line1 still line1\n    now line2 more line2\n    \"\"\"\n    return text.replace('\\n', '')\n\nimport doctest\ndoctest.run_docstring_examples(remove_newlines, globals())\n```\n\nHowever, I am getting a ValueError like \"line 3 of the docstring for NoName has inconsistent leading whitespace: '\"'\". How can I solve this?"

        "content": "When writing doctests in Python, it's important to ensure that the expected output in the docstring matches exactly what the function will return, including any whitespace. In your case, the issue arises because the expected output format in the docstring is not correctly articulated, and there's a mismatch in the indentation of the lines within the multi-line string.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can fix it:\n\n1. Ensure that the expected output matches the function's actual output exactly.\n2. Align the triple quotes and use consistent indentation in the docstring.\n\nHere's a corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\ndef remove_newlines(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    >>> remove_newlines(\"line1 \\\\n\"\n    ...                 \"still line 1\\\\r\"\n    ...                 \"now line2 \\\\n\"\n    ...                 \"more line2\\\\n\")\n    'line1 still line 1\\\\rnow line2 more line2'\n    \"\"\"\n    return text.replace('\\n', '')\n\nimport doctest\ndoctest.run_docstring_examples(remove_newlines, globals(), name=\"remove_newlines\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **String Representation**: Use raw strings or escape backslashes in the input within the test if you want to represent `\\n` in the expected input.\n- **Expected Output**: Make sure that the expected output in the doctest is exactly the same as the function's output, including any newline or carriage return characters.\n- **Indentation**: Ensure that all parts of the triple-quoted string are consistently indented and aligned.\n\nThis should resolve the `ValueError` that you're encountering."
