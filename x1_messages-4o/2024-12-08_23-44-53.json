Here's the formula you would enter in cell D1:\n\n```\n=ABS(A1-B1)\n```\n\nThis formula subtracts the value in cell B1 from the value in cell A1 and then applies the `ABS` function to ensure the result is always a positive number, regardless of which number is larger. This will give you the absolute difference between the two numbers."
