I have been using `time.sleep(5)` to delay the closing so I can view the graphics. Is there a method to make this process more dynamic, such as telling Python to wait for my command before closing the window? I wouldn't mind if the script is halted while it waits for my command. I'd prefer to avoid using the console for a `read()`. Ideally, I would like the canvas to remain open after the script has finished running, but I am also open to solutions that will halt the script until I either close the window or click the canvas. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To keep the turtle graphics window open after the script finishes executing, you can use the `turtle.done()` function. This function will keep the window open until it is manually closed by the user. Alternatively, you can use `turtle.mainloop()`, which essentially does the same thing by starting a loop that waits for user interaction. Here\u2019s an example of how you can use it:\n\n```python\nimport turtle\n\n# Your turtle drawing code here\nt = turtle.Turtle()\n\nt.forward(100)\nt.left(90)\nt.forward(100)\n\n# Keep the window open\nturtle.done()\n```\n\nThis will keep the turtle graphics window open until you close it manually. If you want the program to respond to a mouse click, you can use the `turtle.Screen().exitonclick()` method, which will keep the window open and close it when you click on it:\n\n```python\nimport turtle\n\n# Your turtle drawing code here\nt = turtle.Turtle()\n\nt.forward(100)\nt.left(90)\nt.forward(100)\n\n# Wait for a mouse click to close the window\nturtle.Screen().exitonclick()\n```\n\nUsing `exitonclick()` is particularly useful if you want to ensure that the window only closes when you're ready, providing a more interactive experience."
