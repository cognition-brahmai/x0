The available denominations and their corresponding exchange rates are as follows:\nDenomination | Exchange Rate\n------------ | -------------\n$50 | 0.85\n$20 | 0.80\n$10 | 0.75\n$5 | 0.70\n$1 | 0.65\nCreate a function in JavaScript that takes in the amount of money you want to exchange and returns the minimum number of bills you need to receive the desired amount, based on the available denominations. \nFor example, if you want to exchange $100, the function should return \"2 $50 bills\". However, if you want to exchange $27, the function should return \"1 $20 bill, 1 $5 bill, and 2 $1 bills\".\nGood luck!"

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the minimum number of bills required for a given amount of money based on the available denominations. We will write a JavaScript function that takes an amount as input and returns the optimal combination of bills required. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```javascript\nfunction exchangeCurrency(amount) {\n    const denominations = [50, 20, 10, 5, 1];\n    const result = [];\n\n    for (let i = 0; i < denominations.length; i++) {\n        const billValue = denominations[i];\n        const count = Math.floor(amount / billValue);\n        if (count > 0) {\n            result.push(`${count} $${billValue} bill${count > 1 ? 's' : ''}`);\n            amount -= count * billValue;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return result.join(', ');\n}\n\n// Example usage\nconsole.log(exchangeCurrency(100)); // Output: \"2 $50 bills\"\nconsole.log(exchangeCurrency(27));  // Output: \"1 $20 bill, 1 $5 bill, 2 $1 bills\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Denominations Array:** We define an array `denominations` which contains the available bill values sorted in descending order.\n2. **Loop Through Denominations:** We loop through each denomination, starting with the largest.\n3. **Calculate Count:** For each denomination, we calculate how many bills of that denomination can fit into the remaining `amount`.\n4. **Update Result:** If we can use at least one bill of that denomination, we add the count and denomination to the `result` array.\n5. **Subtract from Amount:** We subtract the equivalent value from the `amount` based on how many bills were used.\n6. **Build Output:** Finally, we join the `result` array into a single string with proper formatting and return it.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the minimum number of bills required to make up the desired amount using a greedy algorithm."
