        "content": "Yes, you can set environment variables for your local virtualenv to match those defined on your Heroku project. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Retrieve Environment Variables from Heroku:**\n   First, you'll want to get the environment variables from your Heroku app. You can do this by using the Heroku CLI:\n\n   ```bash\n   heroku config -a your-heroku-app-name\n   ```\n\n   This command lists all the environment variables set for your Heroku app.\n\n2. **Create a `.env` File Locally:**\n   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your local project. This file will contain all the necessary environment variables in the format `KEY=VALUE`, one per line. For example:\n\n   ```plaintext\n   DATABASE_URL=your-database-url\n   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key\n   ```\n\n3. **Load Environment Variables in Virtualenv:**\n   Use a tool like `python-dotenv` to automatically load these variables when your application starts. First, install `python-dotenv` in your virtualenv:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install python-dotenv\n   ```\n\n   Then, in your application entry point (e.g., `app.py`), add the following code to load the environment variables from the `.env` file:\n\n   ```python\n   from dotenv import load_dotenv\n   import os\n\n   load_dotenv()\n\n   # Now you can use os.environ to access your environment variables\n   secret_key = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')\n   ```\n\n4. **Activate Your Virtualenv:**\n   Make sure your virtualenv is activated whenever you run your application locally. This ensures that your Python environment is isolated and uses the dependencies specified for your project.\n\nBy following these steps, you can mimic the environment variables from your Heroku app locally, allowing you to test your application under the same conditions as it would run on Heroku."
