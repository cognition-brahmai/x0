I am attempting to measure the skewness and kurtosis of a normal distribution using scipy.stats in Python 2.7.6, scipy 0.17.1 and numpy 1.12.1. I have understood that the skewness and kurtosis of a normal distribution should be 0. However, when I run my code, I get different results. Here is the code I am running:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import kurtosis\nfrom scipy.stats import skew\n\nx = np.linspace( -5, 5, 1000 )\ny = 1./(np.sqrt(2.*np.pi)) * np.exp( -.5*(x)**2  )  # normal distribution\n\nprint( 'excess kurtosis of normal distribution (should be 0): {}'.format( kurtosis(y) ))\nprint( 'skewness of normal distribution (should be 0): {}'.format( skew(y) ))\n```\n\nThe output I receive is:\n\n```\nexcess kurtosis of normal distribution (should be 0): -0.307393087742\nskewness of normal distribution (should be 0): 1.11082371392\n```\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?"

        "content": "Your current approach is calculating the skewness and kurtosis of the probability density function (PDF) values rather than the distribution itself. The `scipy.stats.skew()` and `scipy.stats.kurtosis()` functions are designed to compute the skewness and kurtosis of a dataset, not a PDF.\n\nTo calculate the skewness and kurtosis of a normal distribution, you should generate random samples from that distribution and then compute the skewness and kurtosis of those samples.\n\nHere's how you can do it correctly:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import kurtosis, skew, norm\n\n# Generate random samples from a normal distribution\nsamples = norm.rvs(size=1000, random_state=42)\n\n# Calculate skewness and kurtosis\nprint('Excess kurtosis of normal distribution (should be 0): {}'.format(kurtosis(samples)))\nprint('Skewness of normal distribution (should be 0): {}'.format(skew(samples)))\n```\n\nIn this example, `norm.rvs()` is used to generate random samples from a normal distribution. This is the correct input for the `skew()` and `kurtosis()` functions. The results should be close to zero, given a sufficiently large sample size, validating that the distribution is indeed normal."
