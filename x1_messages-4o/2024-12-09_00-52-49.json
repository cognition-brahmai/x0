How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To read a CSV file that uses a semicolon (`;`) as a delimiter, you need to specify the `sep` parameter in the `read_csv` function. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ncsv_path = \"C:....\"  # Replace with your actual file path\ndata = pd.read_csv(csv_path, sep=';')\n\nprint(data)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We're using `pd.read_csv()` instead of `read_csv()` directly to clarify that it comes from the `pandas` library.\n- The `sep=';'` parameter tells pandas to use the semicolon as the column separator.\n\nThis should correctly parse the CSV file and split the data into columns based on the semicolon delimiter. When you print `data`, it should show the contents organized into separate columns."
