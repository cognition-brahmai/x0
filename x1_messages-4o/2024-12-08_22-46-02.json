        "content": "\\textbf{Cleaning Tool:} \\underline{Advanced Space Vacuum Cleaner (ASVC)}\n\nThe Advanced Space Vacuum Cleaner (ASVC) is an optimal tool for cleaning an abandoned spaceship due to its specialized design features that effectively tackle layers of dust and debris in a zero-gravity environment. Below are the detailed descriptions and the step-by-step process for using the ASVC:\n\n1. **Nozzle Design**: The ASVC is equipped with a multi-angle, adjustable nozzle that can pivot and extend to reach tight and awkward spaces within the spaceship. Its design ensures a firm grip on various surfaces, allowing it to efficiently suck up dust and debris without causing any damage to delicate instruments or panels.\n\n2. **HEPA Filter**: The ASVC is fitted with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter that traps 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns. This feature is crucial in a spaceship environment to ensure that no harmful particles are released back into the air, maintaining a clean and safe atmosphere for future occupants.\n\n3. **Detachable Hose**: The ASVC includes a flexible, detachable hose that can extend up to 10 feet. This allows the user to reach high and challenging areas, such as overhead compartments and narrow crevices where dust tends to accumulate. The hose can be easily attached and detached, providing versatility and ease of use.\n\n### Step-by-Step Cleaning Process:\n\n1. **Preparation**: \n   - Ensure the ASVC is fully charged and inspect all its components, including the nozzle, filter, and hose, for any damages or blockages.\n   - Put on a protective suit and mask to safeguard against inhaling dust particles during cleaning.\n\n2. **Initial Dust Removal**: \n   - Start by using the adjustable nozzle to vacuum open and accessible areas. Adjust the nozzle angle to match the surface orientation for efficient cleaning.\n   - Pay special attention to flat surfaces such as floors, walls, and control panels.\n\n3. **Targeting Hard-to-Reach Areas**: \n   - Attach the detachable hose to the ASVC. Begin cleaning overhead compartments, corners, and narrow spaces using the hose to extract dust hidden in these areas.\n   - If the hose has multiple attachments, choose the one that best fits the area being cleaned.\n\n4. **HEPA Filter Maintenance**:\n   - Periodically check the HEPA filter to ensure it is not clogged. If necessary, clean or replace the filter to maintain optimal performance.\n   - After completing the cleaning, perform a final check of the filter to ensure no trapped particles are left behind.\n\n5. **Final Inspection and Shutdown**:\n   - Conduct a thorough inspection of the cleaned areas to ensure no spots are missed. Use the nozzle and hose to address any remaining dust.\n   - Once satisfied, carefully pack the ASVC, ensuring that all detachable parts are secured for future use.\n\nThe Advanced Space Vacuum Cleaner (ASVC) is specifically chosen for its adaptability and efficiency in maintaining a clean and safe environment in the unique and challenging confines of an abandoned spaceship."
