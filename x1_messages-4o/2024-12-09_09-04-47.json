Here's a simple example in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_max(sequence):\n    # Check if the sequence is empty\n    if not sequence:\n        return None  # or raise an exception, depending on your use case\n\n    # Initialize the maximum value with the first element of the sequence\n    max_value = sequence[0]\n\n    # Iterate over the sequence starting from the second element\n    for number in sequence[1:]:\n        # Update the maximum value if the current number is greater\n        if number > max_value:\n            max_value = number\n\n    return max_value\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]\nmax_number = find_max(numbers)\nprint(\"The maximum value is:\", max_number)\n```\n\nIn this function, `find_max`, we first check if the sequence is empty and handle that case accordingly. Then, we initialize `max_value` with the first element of the sequence. By iterating over the sequence starting from the second element, we compare each number with `max_value` and update it if we find a larger number. Finally, we return the maximum value found."
