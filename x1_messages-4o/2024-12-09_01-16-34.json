However, I encountered a couple of errors in one of my test cases and I would like to run that specific test case only, instead of running the whole test suite again. The test suite file \"mytestsuite.robot\" includes the following test cases:\n\n```\ntestcase1\n....\n....\ntestcase2\n....\n....\ntestcase3\n....\n....\ntestcase4\n....\n....\n```\n\nIn this scenario, let's say test case 3 failed and I want to just rerun test case 3. I tried to use the command `pybot mytestsuite.robot -t testcase3` but I received an error. How can I correctly execute this specific test case?"

        "content": "To execute a specific test case from a test suite in Robot Framework, you need to ensure that you are using the correct syntax and tools. The command `pybot` has been deprecated, and you should use `robot` instead. Here's how you can run a specific test case:\n\n1. **Correct Command Syntax**: The command should be structured correctly to specify the test case you want to run. You should use the `robot` command (instead of `pybot`) and specify the test case name with the `-t` or `--test` option.\n\n2. **Running a Specific Test Case**: Here\u2019s the correct command to run just `testcase3` from your `mytestsuite.robot` file:\n\n   ```bash\n   robot -t \"testcase3\" mytestsuite.robot\n   ```\n\n3. **Ensure Proper Naming**: Make sure that the name of the test case matches exactly what you have in your `.robot` file, including any spaces or special characters.\n\n4. **Environment Setup**: Ensure that your environment is set up correctly and that `robot` is installed. You can verify this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   robot --version\n   ```\n\n   If Robot Framework is correctly installed, this command will output the version number.\n\n5. **Path and Directory**: Make sure you are in the correct directory where `mytestsuite.robot` is located or provide the full path to the file in the command.\n\nBy using the above approach, you should be able to run just the specific test case that you need to debug or verify without executing the entire suite."
