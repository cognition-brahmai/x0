I need to split the data into an 80-20 train-test split while ensuring that the split data proportionally represents the values of one column, which is 'Categories'. The data looks like this:\n\n```\nReviewerID       ReviewText        Categories       ProductId\n1212             good product       Mobile           14444425\n1233             will buy again     drugs            324532\n5432             not recommended    dvd              789654123 \n```\n\nI'm currently using this code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nMeta = pd.read_csv('C:\\\\Users\\\\xyz\\\\Desktop\\\\WM Project\\\\Joined.csv')\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split\n\ntrain, test = train_test_split(Meta.categories, test_size = 0.2, stratify=y)\n```\n\nBut it's returning a NameError: `name 'y' is not defined`. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong or whether this code will stratify based on the 'Categories' column. If I remove the stratify option and the 'Categories' column from the train-test split, the code works fine. Can you help me solve this?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that you're trying to use a variable `y` which hasn't been defined in your code. In the context of using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn, the `stratify` parameter is used to ensure that the distribution of a particular column (in this case, 'Categories') is maintained in both the train and test datasets. To achieve this, you should pass the 'Categories' column itself to the `stratify` parameter.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to perform the correct train-test split with stratification:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split  # Updated module name\n\n# Load the data\nMeta = pd.read_csv('C:\\\\Users\\\\xyz\\\\Desktop\\\\WM Project\\\\Joined.csv')\n\n# Perform train-test split with stratification\ntrain, test = train_test_split(Meta, test_size=0.2, stratify=Meta['Categories'])\n\n# Check the distribution\nprint(\"Train distribution:\\n\", train['Categories'].value_counts(normalize=True))\nprint(\"Test distribution:\\n\", test['Categories'].value_counts(normalize=True))\n```\n\n### Key Adjustments:\n1. **Correct Module Import**: Use `from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split` instead of `from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split`. The module name was updated in more recent versions of scikit-learn.\n2. **Stratification Column**: Pass the actual 'Categories' column from your dataframe to the `stratify` parameter to ensure the split maintains the distribution of categories.\n3. **Correct Data Splitting**: Ensure you're splitting the entire dataframe `Meta` and not just the 'Categories' column.\n\nThis will ensure that both your train and test datasets have a similar distribution of the 'Categories' column as in the original dataset."
