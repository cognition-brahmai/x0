Is there a simple way to delete all the widgets from `plot_layout`? Here is the code snippet I'm working with:\n\n```python\nself.plot_layout = QtGui.QGridLayout()\nself.plot_layout.setGeometry(QtCore.QRect(200,200,200,200))\nself.root_layout.addLayout(self.plot_layout)\nself.plot_layout.addWidget(MyWidget())\n```\n\nI can't seem to find a method that allows me to achieve this."

        "content": "To clear all widgets from a `QGridLayout` in PyQt, you can iterate over the items in the layout, remove each widget, and then delete it. Here is a function you can use to clear the `plot_layout`:\n\n```python\ndef clear_layout(layout):\n    while layout.count():\n        item = layout.takeAt(0)\n        widget = item.widget()\n        if widget is not None:\n            widget.deleteLater()\n\n# Usage\nclear_layout(self.plot_layout)\n```\n\nYou can call this `clear_layout` function whenever you need to remove all widgets from `plot_layout`. This will ensure that all widgets are properly removed and marked for deletion. \n\nAfter clearing the layout, you can add your new widget:\n\n```python\nself.plot_layout.addWidget(MyNewWidget())\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that all widgets are removed from the layout and that their resources are freed appropriately."
