        "content": "What is the difference between using LinearRegression() and Ridge(alpha=0) in sklearn's linear model? The Tikhonov (ridge) cost becomes equivalent to the least squares cost when the alpha parameter approaches zero. I expected `sklearn.linear_model.Ridge(alpha=1e-100).fit(data, target)` to be equivalent to `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression().fit(data, target)` based on the information in the scikit-learn documentation, but this doesn't seem to be the case. Why is this so? Here is a code snippet for reference:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import Ridge, LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\ndataset = pd.read_csv('house_price_data.csv')\n\nX = dataset['sqft_living'].reshape(-1, 1)\nY = dataset['price'].reshape(-1, 1)\n\npolyX = PolynomialFeatures(degree=15).fit_transform(X)\n\nmodel1 = LinearRegression().fit(polyX, Y)\nmodel2 = Ridge(alpha=1e-100).fit(polyX, Y)\n\nplt.plot(X, Y,'.',\n         X, model1.predict(polyX),'g-',\n         X, model2.predict(polyX),'r-')\n```\n\nNote: the plot looks the same for `alpha=1e-8` or `alpha=1e-100`."

        "content": "The expectation that `Ridge(alpha=0)` should yield the same results as `LinearRegression()` is theoretically sound because ridge regression with an alpha of zero essentially becomes ordinary least squares regression. However, there are a few practical considerations and potential issues that could lead to discrepancies:\n\n1. **Numerical Precision**: When working with very small values for `alpha`, numerical stability and precision can become an issue. Computers have finite precision when representing floating-point numbers, and operations involving very small values can lead to unexpected behavior or results. An `alpha` of `1e-100` might be too small to be accurately represented and handled in computations, leading to potential numerical instability.\n\n2. **Implementation Details**: The underlying implementation of `Ridge` and `LinearRegression` in scikit-learn could be slightly different, even though they are designed to solve the same optimization problem when `alpha=0`. This can lead to subtle differences in the results due to variations in the optimization algorithms used, initialization of parameters, or convergence criteria.\n\n3. **Regularization Impact**: Even a minuscule amount of regularization might have an observable effect, especially in cases with multicollinearity or when fitting high-degree polynomial features as in your example. The presence of polynomial features can exacerbate the sensitivity to regularization due to the large condition number of the design matrix.\n\n4. **Default Parameters**: Check for any other default parameters in `Ridge` that might differ from those in `LinearRegression`. For instance, the solver or tolerance parameters might have different defaults, which can impact the model fitting process.\n\nTo diagnose the issue further:\n\n- **Inspect Coefficients**: Compare the coefficients of both models to see if they differ. This might give insight into how the models are fitting the data differently.\n\n- **Adjust Solver and Tolerance**: Experiment with different solver options and tolerance settings in `Ridge` to see if the discrepancy persists. For example, using `solver='svd'` can sometimes help as it computes the exact solution.\n\n- **Check for Warnings**: Look out for any warnings during the fitting process that might indicate numerical issues or convergence problems.\n\nIn practice, for very small `alpha` values, consider using `LinearRegression` directly unless there is a specific reason to use `Ridge` with such a small `alpha`."
