Here's a poem about love:\n\nIn the quiet whispers of the night,\nLove dances softly, a gentle light.\nA tapestry woven with threads so fine,\nBinding hearts in an endless line.\n\nWith every glance, a spark ignites,\nA symphony of stars in flight.\nIn tender words and silent sighs,\nLove's sweet embrace never denies.\n\nIt\u2019s the warmth in a winter\u2019s chill,\nThe gentle slope of a moonlit hill.\nA promise held in a lover\u2019s gaze,\nA timeless journey through endless days.\n\nIn the garden where roses bloom,\nLove finds its home in sweet perfume.\nA melody that never fades,\nA bond that even time can't shade.\n\nFor love is patient, love is kind,\nA treasure sought, and there we find,\nA universe in a single touch,\nThe miracle of loving much."
