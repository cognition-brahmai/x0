I have an example code in Python 2.x which achieves this, but I am not able to implement it in Python 3.2. Below is the code snippet:\n\n```python\na = 1\nprint('{0:3}'.format(a))\n```\n\nThis gives me '  1' instead of the '001' I want. The Python 2.x equivalent would be `print \"%03d\" % number`. Can someone help me with the Python 3.2 equivalent?"

        "content": "In Python 3.2, you can achieve zero-padding for integers using the `str.format()` method with a specific format specifier. To format an integer with leading zeros to a fixed width, you can use the following approach:\n\n```python\na = 1\nformatted_number = '{:03}'.format(a)\nprint(formatted_number)\n```\n\nHere's the breakdown of the format specifier `{:03}`:\n\n- `:` indicates the start of the format specifier.\n- `0` indicates that you want to pad with zeros.\n- `3` specifies the total width of the formatted number, including any leading zeros.\n\nThis will output `001` as desired. Note that this is the recommended way to handle such formatting in Python 3.x, including Python 3.2."
