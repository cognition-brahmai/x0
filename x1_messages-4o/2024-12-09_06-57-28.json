        "content": "To achieve the effect of updating a counter on the webpage every half second using Flask, you'll need to adjust your approach. The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that each call to `render_template` is rendering the entire HTML document again, leading to multiple lines instead of updating the existing content.\n\nInstead, you can use Server-Sent Events (SSE) to push updates from the server to the client. Here\u2019s how you can modify your code to use SSE for streaming updates to the webpage:\n\n### Flask Route\n\nYou need to set up a route that streams data using the `text/event-stream` content type. This allows the server to push updates to the client:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, Response, render_template\nfrom time import sleep\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/scans/')\ndef scans_query():\n    return render_template('scans.html')\n\n@app.route('/stream')\ndef stream():\n    def generate():\n        for i in range(50):\n            yield f\"data: {i}\\n\\n\"\n            sleep(0.5)\n    return Response(generate(), mimetype='text/event-stream')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n### Template (HTML with JavaScript)\n\nIn your `scans.html`, you will use JavaScript to listen for events from the server and update the content of the page:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>Streaming Counter</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <p id=\"counter\">0</p>\n\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n        const eventSource = new EventSource(\"/stream\");\n\n        eventSource.onmessage = function(event) {\n            document.getElementById(\"counter\").textContent = event.data;\n        };\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Flask Route**: The `/stream` route acts as a server-sent event provider, streaming data to clients. The loop in `generate` sends incrementing numbers to the client every half second.\n\n2. **Template**: The HTML template contains a `<p>` element with an ID `counter` where the counter value will be displayed. The JavaScript part establishes a connection to the `/stream` endpoint using `EventSource`. The `onmessage` event handler updates the paragraph's text content with the data received from the server.\n\nThis approach effectively creates a real-time counter that updates every half second, without rendering the entire page repeatedly."
