After performing some modifications to the XML, the `pretty_print=True` argument in `etree.write(FILE_NAME, pretty_print=True)` doesn't seem to work. The XML file I am working with is as follows:\n\n```xml\n<testsuites tests=\"14\" failures=\"0\" disabled=\"0\" errors=\"0\" time=\"0.306\" name=\"AllTests\">\n    <testsuite name=\"AIR\" tests=\"14\" failures=\"0\" disabled=\"0\" errors=\"0\" time=\"0.306\">\n    ....\n</testsuite>\n</testsuites>\n```\n\nAnd here's the code I've written:\n\n```python\ntree = etree.parse('original.xml')\nroot = tree.getroot()\n\n...    \n# modifications\n...\n\nwith open(FILE_NAME, \"w\") as f:\n    tree.write(f, pretty_print=True)\n```\n\nHowever, the XML is not being pretty printed as expected. What could be the issue?"

        "content": "When using the `lxml` library for pretty printing XML, there are a few things to check if the output is not formatted as expected:\n\n1. **Ensure Proper Parsing**: Make sure that the XML file is correctly parsed without any errors. If there are any parsing errors, they might prevent the tree from being properly modified or written.\n\n2. **Check Modifications**: Ensure that the modifications you are making to the XML do not introduce any structural issues that might affect the pretty-printing process. Verify the integrity of the XML structure after modifications.\n\n3. **Encoding**: If the XML contains special characters or if encoding is specified in the XML declaration, ensure that the correct encoding is used when writing the file. For example, if the XML is UTF-8 encoded, specify it while writing the file.\n\n4. **Writing to File**: When writing to the file, it's important to ensure the file is opened in binary mode or specify the encoding explicitly. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nfrom lxml import etree\n\n# Parse the XML file\ntree = etree.parse('original.xml')\nroot = tree.getroot()\n\n# Perform modifications\n# ...\n\n# Write the modified XML back to file with pretty printing\nwith open(FILE_NAME, \"wb\") as f:  # Open in binary mode\n    tree.write(f, pretty_print=True, encoding='UTF-8', xml_declaration=True)\n```\n\n5. **XML Declaration**: If your original XML file includes an XML declaration, make sure to include it when writing the file. The `xml_declaration=True` ensures that the XML declaration is included in the output file.\n\n6. **Library Version**: Ensure you're using an up-to-date version of the `lxml` library, as older versions might have bugs or limitations.\n\nBy ensuring these aspects are correctly handled, the XML should be pretty-printed as expected."
