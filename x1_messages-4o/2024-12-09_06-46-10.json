I have an image 'audacious' in PNG format with size (1094, 960) and mode RGBA. However, when I try to convert the image file type using the 'save' method like this:\n\n```python\naudacious.save('audacious.jpg')\n```\n\nI encounter an OSError that says \"cannot write mode RGBA as JPEG\". This error is not mentioned in the book. How can I fix this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that JPEG format does not support the RGBA mode, which includes an alpha channel (transparency). JPEG images can only be saved in RGB mode, which means you need to remove the alpha channel before saving the image as a JPEG.\n\nHere's how you can convert the image from RGBA to RGB before saving it as a JPEG:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\n\n# Open the image file\naudacious = Image.open('audacious.png')\n\n# Convert the image from RGBA to RGB\naudacious_rgb = audacious.convert('RGB')\n\n# Save the image in JPEG format\naudacious_rgb.save('audacious.jpg')\n```\n\nThis code first opens your PNG image, then converts it to RGB mode (which removes the alpha channel), and finally saves it as a JPEG file. This should resolve the OSError you're encountering."
