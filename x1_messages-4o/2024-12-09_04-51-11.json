        "content": "In Python, both `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` are decorators used to define methods within a class, but they serve different purposes and have distinct behaviors.\n\n### `@staticmethod`\n- **Definition**: A static method does not take an implicit first argument (i.e., it does not take the instance or the class as its first parameter).\n- **Usage**: It behaves like a regular function but belongs to the class's namespace. This means you can call it on the class itself or an instance of the class without needing any reference to the class or instance.\n- **Purpose**: Use `@staticmethod` when you want to define a method inside a class that does not require access to the class or instance-specific data. It's often used for utility functions related to the class.\n\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n    @staticmethod\n    def static_method(arg1, arg2):\n        return arg1 + arg2\n\n# Usage\nresult = MyClass.static_method(1, 2)\n```\n\n### `@classmethod`\n- **Definition**: A class method takes the class itself as the first argument (conventionally named `cls`) rather than an instance of the class.\n- **Usage**: This method can access and modify class state that applies across all instances of the class. You call it on the class itself.\n- **Purpose**: Use `@classmethod` when you need to access or modify the class state or when you want to provide alternative constructors.\n\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n    class_variable = 0\n\n    @classmethod\n    def class_method(cls, increment):\n        cls.class_variable += increment\n        return cls.class_variable\n\n# Usage\nresult = MyClass.class_method(5)\n```\n\n### Key Differences\n- **First Parameter**: `@staticmethod` doesn't take any special first parameter, while `@classmethod` takes `cls` as its first parameter.\n- **Access**: `@staticmethod` cannot access or modify the class or instance state, whereas `@classmethod` can access and modify class state.\n- **Use Cases**: Use `@staticmethod` for utility methods and `@classmethod` for factory methods or methods that need to modify class-level data.\n\nChoose between these decorators based on whether you need to access or modify class-level data or just need a utility function that fits within the class's namespace."
