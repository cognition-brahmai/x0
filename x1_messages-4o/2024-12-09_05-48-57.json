The dates are in UK format (%d/%m/%Y), for example \"12/01/2012\" and \"30/01/2012\", which represent 12 January 2012 and 30 January 2012 respectively. I'm using pandas version 0.11.0 and the code I am using is:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n...\ncpts.Date = cpts.Date.apply(pd.to_datetime)\n```\nHowever, this results in inconsistent conversions. For example, \"12/01/2012\" is converted to 1 December 2012 rather than 12 January 2012, while \"30/01/2012\" is correctly converted to 30 January 2012. I also tried specifying the date format, like so:\n```python\ncpts.Date = cpts.Date.apply(pd.to_datetime, format='%d/%m/%Y')\n```\nBut the results remain the same. Going by the source code, I believe I'm doing things correctly. Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely related to how `pd.to_datetime` handles date parsing. In older versions of pandas, such as 0.11.0, there might be some inconsistencies in how date formats are inferred, especially when the `format` parameter is not explicitly specified or the function behavior is not as robust as in later versions.\n\nTo address this issue, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. **Ensure Correct Format Specification**: When specifying the format, you should use `dayfirst=True` if you suspect pandas is not respecting the format due to some parsing inconsistencies.\n\n2. **Use `dayfirst` Parameter**: To explicitly tell pandas that the date format is day-first, you can use the `dayfirst` parameter within `pd.to_datetime`.\n\nHere's how to modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Ensure to use the dayfirst parameter\ncpts.Date = cpts.Date.apply(pd.to_datetime, dayfirst=True)\n\n# Alternatively, if you want to specify the exact format\ncpts.Date = cpts.Date.apply(pd.to_datetime, format='%d/%m/%Y', dayfirst=True)\n```\n\n3. **Upgrade pandas if possible**: If your environment allows it, consider upgrading to a more recent version of pandas where date parsing has become more reliable and flexible. This might require updating other dependencies, so ensure your environment can handle the upgrade.\n\n4. **Check for Inconsistent Data**: Make sure there are no inconsistencies in your date strings (e.g., whitespace, different delimiters, or unexpected formats) that could affect parsing.\n\nUsing `dayfirst=True` explicitly tells pandas that the dates should be interpreted with the day first, which should resolve the issue of misinterpreting \"12/01/2012\" as December 1st."
