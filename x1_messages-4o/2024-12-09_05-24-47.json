I have a virtualenv ready, I've uploaded my project to GitHub, I have a .gitignore file for Python, and I'm using the requests library for interacting with the REST API. My current directory tree looks like this:\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 bin\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 /the usual stuff/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 include\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 /the usual stuff/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 lib\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 python2.7\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 /the usual stuff/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 local\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 /the usual stuff/\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 README.md\n27 directories, 280 files\n```\n\nI'm not sure where to put the .py files.

        "content": "Creating a Python module or package that can be installed using `pip` involves organizing your code and setting up some configuration files. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you build a Python package for your REST API wrapper:\n\n### Step 1: Organize Your Project Directory\n\nFirst, you need to organize your project directory to follow a standard Python package structure. Here\u2019s a simple structure you could use:\n\n```\nyour_project/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 your_package/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 api_wrapper.py  # Your main module file\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 tests/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 test_api_wrapper.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 setup.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt\n```\n\n- **`your_package/`**: This is the directory where your main code files will reside. The `__init__.py` file makes this directory a package. You can create your API wrapper file (`api_wrapper.py`) here.\n\n- **`tests/`**: This is where you can put your test files. It's a good practice to write tests for your code.\n\n- **`setup.py`**: This is a script for building and distributing your package. It will contain metadata about your package.\n\n- **`requirements.txt`**: List any dependencies your package needs here.\n\n### Step 2: Write Your Code\n\nWrite your API wrapper in `api_wrapper.py`. Here\u2019s a very basic example:\n\n```python\n# your_package/api_wrapper.py\n\nimport requests\n\nclass APIClient:\n    def __init__(self, base_url):\n        self.base_url = base_url\n\n    def get(self, endpoint):\n        response = requests.get(f\"{self.base_url}/{endpoint}\")\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        return response.json()\n\n    # Add more methods as needed\n```\n\n### Step 3: Write Your Setup Script\n\nThe `setup.py` file contains information about your package and is used by `setuptools` to build and distribute it. Here\u2019s a basic example:\n\n```python\n# setup.py\n\nfrom setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\nsetup(\n    name='your_package_name',\n    version='0.1.0',\n    description='A Python wrapper for a REST API',\n    author='Your Name',\n    author_email='your.email@example.com',\n    url='https://github.com/yourusername/your_project',\n    packages=find_packages(),\n    install_requires=[\n        'requests',  # Add other dependencies here\n    ],\n    classifiers=[\n        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3',\n        'License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License',\n        'Operating System :: OS Independent',\n    ],\n    python_requires='>=3.6',\n)\n```\n\n### Step 4: Add Dependencies\n\nIn `requirements.txt`, list any third-party libraries your package depends on. For example, since you're using `requests`, you should include:\n\n```\nrequests\n```\n\n### Step 5: Testing Your Package\n\nWrite tests for your package and place them in the `tests/` directory. You can use `unittest` or `pytest` for testing. Here's a simple example using `unittest`:\n\n```python\n# tests/test_api_wrapper.py\n\nimport unittest\nfrom your_package.api_wrapper import APIClient\n\nclass TestAPIClient(unittest.TestCase):\n    def test_get(self):\n        client = APIClient('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com')\n        response = client.get('posts/1')\n        self.assertIn('userId', response)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\n### Step 6: Build and Install Your Package Locally\n\nTo build your package, run the following command in the terminal from the root of your project directory:\n\n```bash\npython setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\n```\n\nThis will create a `dist/` directory with your package files.\n\nTo install your package locally, use:\n\n```bash\npip install .\n```\n\n### Step 7: Upload Your Package to PyPI\n\nTo share your package with others, you can upload it to PyPI. First, ensure you have an account on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/). Then, use `twine` to upload your package:\n\n```bash\npip install twine\ntwine upload dist/*\n```\n\nYou\u2019ll be prompted to enter your PyPI credentials.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy following these steps, you\u2019ll have a Python package that can be installed via `pip`. Make sure to update the version number in `setup.py` whenever you make significant changes to your package. Additionally, consider adding more documentation and examples in your `README.md` to help others understand how to use your package."
