I have a project where I need to distribute my own Python package. I made a setup.py script but I would like to build & install it with CMake. I followed the instructions from a StackOverflow post titled \"Using CMake with setup.py\" but it only works with one CMakeLists.txt alongside the setup.py and the Python folder, and without executing cmake from a build directory. I have a specific layout and code in my CMakeLists.txt and setup.py files. However, when I run CMake from the build directory and then make, the target is built but with nothing. It is as if no packages were found. The installation installs the Python package without .py files. Can you help me with this?"

        "content": "To build and install a Python package using `setuptools` (`setup.py`) within a CMake project while using an out-of-source build method, you'll need to ensure that your CMake configuration correctly finds and executes the `setup.py` script. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you achieve this:\n\n### Project Structure\n\nAssuming you have the following project structure:\n\n```\n/your_project\n    /src\n        /python_package\n            __init__.py\n            module.py\n        CMakeLists.txt\n        setup.py\n    /build\n```\n\n### Setup.py\n\nEnsure your `setup.py` is correctly configured to define your package. Here\u2019s a basic example:\n\n```python\nfrom setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\nsetup(\n    name='your_package_name',\n    version='0.1',\n    packages=find_packages(where='src/python_package'),\n    package_dir={'': 'src/python_package'},\n)\n```\n\n### CMakeLists.txt\n\nModify your `CMakeLists.txt` to include steps for handling the Python package build and installation:\n\n```cmake\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)\nproject(YourProjectName)\n\n# Define the path to the Python package source\nset(PYTHON_PACKAGE_SOURCE_DIR ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/src/python_package)\n\n# Define the build output directory\nset(PYTHON_PACKAGE_BUILD_DIR ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/python_package_build)\n\n# Create a custom target for building the Python package\nadd_custom_target(build_python_package ALL\n    COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E make_directory ${PYTHON_PACKAGE_BUILD_DIR}\n    COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy_directory ${PYTHON_PACKAGE_SOURCE_DIR} ${PYTHON_PACKAGE_BUILD_DIR}\n    COMMAND ${PYTHON_EXECUTABLE} ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/src/setup.py build\n    WORKING_DIRECTORY ${PYTHON_PACKAGE_BUILD_DIR}\n)\n\n# Add an installation step\ninstall(CODE \"execute_process(COMMAND ${PYTHON_EXECUTABLE} ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/src/setup.py install)\")\n```\n\n### Build and Install\n\n1. **Navigate to the `build` directory:**\n\n   ```bash\n   cd your_project/build\n   ```\n\n2. **Run CMake to configure the project:**\n\n   ```bash\n   cmake ..\n   ```\n\n3. **Build the project:**\n\n   ```bash\n   make\n   ```\n\n4. **Install the Python package:**\n\n   If you've added the installation step in the `CMakeLists.txt`, the package will be installed during the `make` process. Alternatively, you can run:\n\n   ```bash\n   make install\n   ```\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n1. **Ensure `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE` is set correctly:** You can find the path to the Python executable using `which python` or `which python3` and then modify the `CMakeLists.txt` to use the correct path.\n\n2. **Verify package structure:** Make sure your package has an `__init__.py` file so that `find_packages` can correctly identify it.\n\n3. **Check CMake and Python logs:** If things aren't working as expected, check the output messages from CMake and Python for error messages or warnings.\n\n4. **Environment and permissions:** Ensure you have the necessary permissions to install Python packages, especially if you're installing globally. Consider using a virtual environment for easier management.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to integrate the Python package build and installation process into your CMake workflow, even with an out-of-source build configuration."
