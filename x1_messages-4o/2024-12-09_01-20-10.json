When I run my Flask application in development mode at `http://localhost:5000`, I'm unable to access it from other machines on the network using `http://[dev-host-ip]:5000`. This functionality is working fine with Rails in development mode. I haven't found any relevant documentation regarding the Flask development server configuration. Can someone guide me on how to enable this?"

        "content": "To make your Flask development server accessible across the network, you need to change the host parameter when you run your Flask application. By default, Flask runs the development server on `localhost` (or `127.0.0.1`), which is only accessible from the same machine. To allow access from other machines on the network, you should set the host to `0.0.0.0`. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n### Method 1: Using the `app.run()` method\n\nIf you're running your Flask application using the `app.run()` method, you can specify the `host` parameter like this:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef home():\n    return \"Hello, Flask!\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using the Flask CLI\n\nIf you're using the Flask command-line interface (CLI) to run your application, you can set the `FLASK_RUN_HOST` environment variable or pass the `--host` option:\n\n- **Set the environment variable:**\n\n  On Windows:\n\n  ```cmd\n  set FLASK_APP=your_flask_app.py\n  set FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0\n  flask run\n  ```\n\n  On macOS/Linux:\n\n  ```bash\n  export FLASK_APP=your_flask_app.py\n  export FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0\n  flask run\n  ```\n\n- **Use the `--host` option:**\n\n  ```bash\n  flask run --host=0.0.0.0\n  ```\n\n### Security Consideration\n\nRunning your Flask app with `host='0.0.0.0'` makes it accessible to any device on the network, which can be a security risk, especially if you are using the Flask development server in a production environment. The development server is not intended for production use as it is not optimized for security or performance. For production, consider using a production-ready server like Gunicorn or uWSGI behind a reverse proxy like Nginx.\n\nBy configuring it this way, you should be able to access your Flask application from other devices on your network using `http://[dev-host-ip]:5000`. Make sure your firewall settings allow incoming connections on port 5000 if you face any connectivity issues."
