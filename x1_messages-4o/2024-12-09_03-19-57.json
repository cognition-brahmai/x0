However, when I try to convert the string to an integer using `int(stringExp)`, I get an error: `ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '2^4'`. I know that `eval` can be used to do this, but I am concerned about security issues. Is there a safer method to evaluate a mathematical expression in a string?"

        "content": "Yes, there are safer methods to evaluate mathematical expressions in strings without using `eval`, which can indeed pose security risks if the input is not completely controlled or sanitized. Here are a few alternatives:\n\n1. **Using the `ast` module**:\n   The `ast` module can be used to parse and evaluate mathematical expressions safely. Here's an example of how you can implement this:\n\n   ```python\n   import ast\n   import operator\n\n   # Define allowed operators\n   operators = {\n       ast.Add: operator.add,\n       ast.Sub: operator.sub,\n       ast.Mult: operator.mul,\n       ast.Div: operator.truediv,\n       ast.Pow: operator.pow,\n       ast.BitXor: operator.xor,  # For '^'\n       ast.USub: operator.neg\n   }\n\n   def eval_expr(expr):\n       def _eval(node):\n           if isinstance(node, ast.Num):  # <number>\n               return node.n\n           elif isinstance(node, ast.BinOp):  # <left> <operator> <right>\n               left = _eval(node.left)\n               right = _eval(node.right)\n               return operators[type(node.op)](left, right)\n           elif isinstance(node, ast.UnaryOp):  # <operator> <operand>\n               operand = _eval(node.operand)\n               return operators[type(node.op)](operand)\n           else:\n               raise TypeError(node)\n\n       node = ast.parse(expr, mode='eval').body\n       return _eval(node)\n\n   expression = \"2^4\"\n   result = eval_expr(expression)\n   print(result)  # Output: 16\n   ```\n\n   This method constructs an abstract syntax tree (AST) from the expression and evaluates it using only the allowed operators, mitigating the risk of arbitrary code execution.\n\n2. **Using the `sympy` library**:\n   `sympy` is a powerful symbolic mathematics library that can be used to evaluate expressions safely.\n\n   ```python\n   from sympy import sympify\n\n   expression = \"2^4\"\n   result = sympify(expression)\n   print(result)  # Output: 16\n   ```\n\n   The `sympify` function in `sympy` safely parses the expression and supports a wide range of mathematical operations.\n\n3. **Using `numexpr` library**:\n   If performance is a concern and the expressions are complex, you can consider using `numexpr`.\n\n   ```python\n   import numexpr as ne\n\n   expression = \"2**4\"  # Note: use '**' for power operation\n   result = ne.evaluate(expression)\n   print(result)  # Output: 16\n   ```\n\n   Keep in mind that `numexpr` requires the expression to be slightly modified (e.g., using `**` instead of `^` for power).\n\nThese methods are safer alternatives to `eval` as they restrict the operations that can be performed to a predefined set of safe operations. Choose the one that best fits your needs."
