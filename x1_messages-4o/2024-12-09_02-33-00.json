        "content": "Why is my \"Hello world\" program using CUDA runtime and drivers version 7.0 taking almost 10 seconds to execute on my Ubuntu 14.04 workstation (with 2xIntel XEON e5 + 4x Tesla k20m)? When I remove all the device code, the overall execution takes only 0.001s. The program I'm using to check my installation is this:\n\n```C\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n__global__ void helloFromGPU()\n{\n    printf(\"Hello World from GPU!\\n\");\n}\n\nint main(int argc, char **argv)\n{\n    printf(\"Hello World from CPU!\\n\");\n\n    helloFromGPU<<<1, 1>>>();\n\n    printf(\"Hello World from CPU! Again!\\n\");\n\n    cudaDeviceSynchronize();\n\n    printf(\"Hello World from CPU! Yet again!\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nWhen compiling and running, it takes a significant amount of time:\n\n```C\n$ nvcc hello.cu -O2\n$ time ./hello > /dev/null\n\nreal    0m8.897s\nuser    0m0.004s\nsys     0m1.017s\n```\n\nWhat could be causing this?"

        "content": "The long execution time you are experiencing is likely due to the overhead associated with CUDA initialization and launching a kernel for the first time. Here are a few factors that might be contributing to the delay:\n\n1. **CUDA Runtime Initialization**: The first time you run a CUDA program, the runtime has to initialize, which can involve loading the driver, setting up the context, and other overhead tasks. This can take several seconds, especially on a system with multiple GPUs like yours.\n\n2. **Device Code Execution**: Even though your GPU kernel is very simple, it still involves launching a kernel, which has its own setup time. The actual execution is fast, but the setup and teardown of the kernel can take time.\n\n3. **JIT Compilation**: CUDA compiles PTX code to binary code for the specific architecture of your GPU at runtime, which can add to the initial execution time if the compiled code is not already cached.\n\n4. **Multi-GPU Overheads**: With multiple GPUs, there's additional overhead in managing resources and contexts for each device, even if you're only using one.\n\n5. **Display Driver**: If your workstation is running a graphical interface using one of the Tesla cards (not recommended), this can lead to additional delays as the GPU context switches between graphics and compute.\n\nTo reduce the execution time:\n\n- **Warm-up the GPU**: Run a simple CUDA program before your main program to perform the initialization steps. This can help if you run multiple CUDA programs sequentially.\n\n- **Minimize Kernel Launches**: If possible, minimize the number of kernel launches in your program, especially in scenarios where the kernel execution time is significantly shorter than the launch overhead.\n\n- **Use Persistent CUDA Context**: Keeping a persistent CUDA context open between program runs can reduce initialization time, though this requires more advanced programming techniques.\n\n- **Profile and Optimize**: Use tools like NVIDIA's `nvprof` or `Nsight` to profile your application and identify bottlenecks in the CUDA runtime and kernel execution.\n\n- **Check for Driver Updates**: Although you're using CUDA 7.0, ensure that your driver is up to date, as newer versions might have optimizations that reduce initialization times.\n\nIf the long execution time persists and is problematic for your application, consider these strategies to mitigate the overhead."
