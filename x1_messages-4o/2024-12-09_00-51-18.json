        "content": "Indentation errors in Python usually occur because the code isn't properly aligned, meaning spaces or tabs are used inconsistently. Python relies on indentation to define the structure of code blocks, so even a single space can cause an error. In your provided code, everything seems visually consistent, but there might be a hidden character or a mixing of tabs and spaces that isn't visible in your text editor.\n\nHere's a checklist to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Consistent Indentation**: Ensure that you are using the same method of indentation throughout your code. Python often has issues when tabs and spaces are mixed. It's generally recommended to use spaces (typically 4 spaces per indentation level) in Python.\n\n2. **Check for Hidden Characters**: Sometimes, hidden characters or unexpected whitespace can cause indentation errors. Ensure your text editor is set to show whitespace characters to easily identify them.\n\n3. **Re-indent the Code**: Select all your code and re-indent it using a consistent method. Most good text editors or IDEs have a feature to convert tabs to spaces or vice versa.\n\n4. **Use a Linter**: Use a linter or a code editor with linting capabilities to automatically detect and correct indentation issues.\n\nHere's your code with consistent indentation using 4 spaces:\n\n```python\n# loop\nwhile d <= end_date:\n    # print d.strftime(\"%Y%m%d\")\n    fecha = d.strftime(\"%Y%m%d\")\n    # set url\n    url = 'http://www.wpemergencia.omie.es//datosPub/marginalpdbc/marginalpdbc_' + fecha + '.1'\n    # Download file\n    response = urllib2.urlopen(url)\n    # Open file\n    output = open(fname, 'wb')\n    # Write to file\n    output.write(response.read())\n    # Close and save file\n    output.close()\n    # fecha++\n    d += delta\n```\n\nIf you continue to encounter issues:\n\n- Make sure the first line of your code (`while d <= end_date:`) is at the start of the line with no preceding spaces.\n- Double-check any preceding or surrounding code for similar indentation issues.\n- Consider using modern Python libraries like `requests` instead of `urllib2`, which is more intuitive and easier to handle for HTTP requests (note: `urllib2` is for Python 2, and if you're using Python 3, the equivalent would be `urllib.request`).\n\nIf you've double-checked all of these and the issue persists, consider sharing more of the surrounding code context, as the problem might be occurring outside the snippet you've provided."
