My code looks as follows:\n\n```python\nimport glob, os\nfor file in glob.glob(\"\\\\*.txt\"):\n    if os.access(file, os.R_OK):\n        # Do something\n    else:\n        if not os.access(file, os.R_OK):\n            print(file, \"is not readable\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Something went wrong with file/dir\", file)\n        break\n```\n\nShould I be using a `try/except` block instead? If so, how would I implement this to check for file readability? Additionally, I want the loop to break as soon as an unreadable file is encountered."

        "content": "Your current approach using `os.access` is generally fine for checking file readability. However, you don't need the additional `if not os.access(file, os.R_OK)` check in the `else` block because it's redundant. If the `else` block is executed, it means the file is not readable, so you can directly handle that case.\n\nUsing a `try/except` block is another approach, particularly if you want to handle exceptions that might occur when actually trying to read the file. Here's how you could implement your code using both `os.access` and a `try/except` block:\n\n```python\nimport glob\nimport os\n\nfor file in glob.glob(\"*.txt\"):\n    if os.access(file, os.R_OK):\n        try:\n            with open(file, 'r') as f:\n                # Do something, like reading the file\n                pass\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"An error occurred while processing {file}: {e}\")\n            break\n    else:\n        print(file, \"is not readable\")\n        break\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **os.access**: It checks if the file is readable before trying to open it. This is a preliminary check to avoid unnecessary exceptions.\n   \n2. **try/except**: Even if `os.access` indicates the file is readable, there might be other issues that could prevent the file from being opened (e.g., the file is deleted between the check and the open operation). The `try/except` block helps handle such exceptions gracefully.\n\n3. **Breaking the Loop**: The loop breaks as soon as it encounters an unreadable file or an error occurs while opening a file.\n\nThis approach ensures that you handle both the permission check and any potential runtime errors effectively."
