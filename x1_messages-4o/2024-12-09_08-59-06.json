        "content": "Certainly! You can use a Bash script to extract all PDF documents from a specific directory. Below is a simple script that does this:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Directory to search for PDF files\nDIRECTORY=\"/path/to/your/directory\"\n\n# Destination directory to copy PDF files\nDESTINATION=\"/path/to/destination/directory\"\n\n# Check if the destination directory exists, if not, create it\nif [ ! -d \"$DESTINATION\" ]; then\n    mkdir -p \"$DESTINATION\"\nfi\n\n# Find and copy PDF files\nfind \"$DIRECTORY\" -type f -name \"*.pdf\" -exec cp {} \"$DESTINATION\" \\;\n\necho \"All PDF files have been extracted to $DESTINATION.\"\n```\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Replace `\"/path/to/your/directory\"` with the path of the directory you want to search for PDF files.\n2. Replace `\"/path/to/destination/directory\"` with the path of the directory where you want to copy the PDF files.\n3. Save the script to a file, for example, `extract_pdfs.sh`.\n4. Make the script executable by running `chmod +x extract_pdfs.sh`.\n5. Run the script with `./extract_pdfs.sh`.\n\nThis script uses the `find` command to locate all files with a `.pdf` extension in the specified directory and copies them to the destination directory. Adjust the paths as needed for your specific use case."
