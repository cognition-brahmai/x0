        "content": "To change the default terminal in Visual Studio Code from Windows PowerShell to Bash on Ubuntu (on Windows), you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Open Visual Studio Code**: Launch the Visual Studio Code editor on your Windows 10 PC.\n\n2. **Access Settings**: Click on the gear icon in the lower-left corner of the window to open the settings menu and select \"Settings\" (or press `Ctrl + ,`).\n\n3. **Open JSON Settings**: In the settings menu, click on the \"Open Settings (JSON)\" icon at the top right corner of the settings tab. This will open the settings.json file where you can manually edit the settings.\n\n4. **Edit Terminal Settings**: In the settings.json file, you need to add or modify the terminal settings. Look for the `terminal.integrated.profiles.windows` section. If it doesn't exist, you can add it. Here's an example configuration to set Bash on Ubuntu as the default terminal:\n\n   ```json\n   \"terminal.integrated.profiles.windows\": {\n       \"Ubuntu\": {\n           \"path\": \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\bash.exe\",\n           \"args\": []\n       }\n   },\n   \"terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.windows\": \"Ubuntu\"\n   ```\n\n   Make sure to replace `\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\bash.exe\"` with the correct path if your installation path is different. For newer versions of Windows, you might need to use the path to `wsl.exe` instead, which would be `\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\wsl.exe\"`.\n\n5. **Save and Restart**: Save the changes to the settings.json file and restart Visual Studio Code for the changes to take effect.\n\n6. **Open New Terminal**: Open a new terminal in Visual Studio Code (using `Ctrl + ` or by selecting \"Terminal\" > \"New Terminal\" from the menu). It should now open Bash on Ubuntu by default.\n\nThis should set Bash on Ubuntu as your default terminal in Visual Studio Code on Windows 10."
