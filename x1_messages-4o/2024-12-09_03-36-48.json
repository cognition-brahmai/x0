        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to SSL certificate verification. This happens when the server's SSL certificate cannot be verified by your system. Here are several ways to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify Certificate Chain:**\n   Ensure that the server's SSL certificate is correctly configured and includes the entire certificate chain up to a trusted root certificate authority.\n\n2. **Update Certificate Store:**\n   Your system might not have an up-to-date list of trusted root certificates. You can update the CA certificates on your system to ensure it recognizes the certificate chain.\n\n3. **Ignore SSL Verification (Not Recommended for Production):**\n   If you trust the source and are just testing, you can disable SSL verification by setting `verify=False` in your request. However, this is not secure and should only be used for testing purposes.\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n\n   url = 'that website'\n   headers = {\n       'Accept': 'text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8',\n       'Accept-Language': 'zh-CN,zh;q=0.9,en;q=0.8,ja;q=0.7',\n       'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/68.0.3440.106 Safari/537.36'\n   }\n\n   r = requests.get(url, headers=headers, verify=False)\n   print(r)\n   print(r.status_code)\n   ```\n\n4. **Specify a Certificate File:**\n   If you have access to the server's certificate, you can download it and specify it in your request:\n\n   ```python\n   r = requests.get(url, headers=headers, verify='/path/to/certificate.pem')\n   ```\n\n5. **Use Certifi:**\n   The `certifi` library provides an up-to-date set of root certificates. You can use it to ensure your requests library is using the latest certificates.\n\n   First, install certifi:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install certifi\n   ```\n\n   Then, use it in your code:\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n   import certifi\n\n   url = 'that website'\n   headers = {\n       'Accept': 'text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8',\n       'Accept-Language': 'zh-CN,zh;q=0.9,en;q=0.8,ja;q=0.7',\n       'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/68.0.3440.106 Safari/537.36'\n   }\n\n   r = requests.get(url, headers=headers, verify=certifi.where())\n   print(r)\n   print(r.status_code)\n   ```\n\nTry these solutions to fix the SSL certificate verification error. If you're working in a corporate environment, check with your IT department for any specific configurations or proxy settings that might be affecting SSL verification."
