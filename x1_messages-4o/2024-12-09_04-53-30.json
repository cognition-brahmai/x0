What is a good way to structure the files? Should the number crunching code be in a separate folder than the GUI code and the compiled executables? \n2. How should the build system work for cross-platform software? Is it necessary to set up a different build system for each platform or can I create a common \"makefile\" that would build differently depending on which platform invoked it?\n3. What modifications are needed to ensure the code will build properly on all platforms?\n4. What is the best approach for handling revision control for large projects and integrating it into the build system to get Version.Revision.Build numbers that update each time I build my project?\n\nI am also interested in any book or website recommendations on this topic. Would \"Release It!: Design and Deploy Production-Ready Software\" be suitable?"

        "content": "Starting a large-scale software project with a cross-platform GUI and heavy number crunching is a significant undertaking. Let's tackle your questions one by one:\n\n1. **File Structure:**\n   - It is a good practice to separate the number crunching code from the GUI code. You might consider having a directory structure like this:\n     ```\n     /project_root\n         /src\n             /core        # for number crunching and core logic\n             /gui         # for Qt GUI related code\n         /include         # common headers\n         /build           # build outputs\n         /tests           # unit and integration tests\n         /docs            # documentation\n     ```\n   - This separation aids in maintainability and clarity, allowing different teams or individuals to work on separate parts of the project without interference.\n\n2. **Cross-Platform Build System:**\n   - Using `CMake` instead of traditional `Make` is often recommended for cross-platform projects. CMake can generate platform-specific makefiles or project files, making it easier to handle different environments.\n   - You can create a single `CMakeLists.txt` file that includes platform-specific conditions using CMake's platform detection capabilities to handle different build instructions for each platform.\n\n3. **Platform Compatibility:**\n   - Aim to use platform-independent libraries and APIs as much as possible.\n   - Use conditional compilation (e.g., `#ifdef _WIN32`, `#ifdef __linux__`) to handle platform-specific code.\n   - Regularly test your builds on all target platforms to catch issues early.\n\n4. **Revision Control and Versioning:**\n   - Use a version control system like Git. It's widely used and integrates well with many CI/CD systems.\n   - For versioning, you can use Git tags to manage semantic versioning. Tools like `git describe` can help create automated version strings.\n   - CMake can be configured to update version numbers automatically by including a step in your build process to extract version information from your Git history.\n\n5. **Resources:**\n   - \"Release It!: Design and Deploy Production-Ready Software\" is a great book for understanding the operational aspects of software deployment, which is crucial for building reliable systems.\n   - For CMake, consider the official documentation and community resources. The book \"Professional CMake: A Practical Guide\" by Craig Scott is highly recommended.\n   - For C++ and cross-platform development best practices, \"Effective Modern C++\" by Scott Meyers and \"C++ Concurrency in Action\" by Anthony Williams are excellent reads.\n\nBy structuring your project well, using the right tools, and adhering to best practices, you'll be setting a solid foundation for your software project's success. Good luck!"
