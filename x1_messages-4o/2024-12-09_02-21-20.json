This code imports TensorFlow and prints its version, as shown below: \n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nprint(tf.__version__)\n```\n\nHowever, when I try to run this code again in the same IPython console, I encounter an error stating \"Another metric with the same name already exists.\". Here's the error message:\n\n```python\nFile \"/home/rodrigo/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow_core/python/eager/monitoring.py\", line 121, in init\n  self._metric = self._metric_methods[self._label_length].create(*args)\n  \nAlreadyExistsError: Another metric with the same name already exists.\n```\n\nI notice that I don't get this error if I close the IPython console and then open it again. But I am facing this issue in every code that imports TensorFlow. I am using Ubuntu 19.04, Spyder 3.3.2, Python 3.7.3, IPython 5.8.0, and TensorFlow 2.0.0-rc2. Could anyone help me resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering seems to be related to how TensorFlow and its metrics are being handled in the IPython console. The error \"Another metric with the same name already exists\" typically arises when TensorFlow's internal monitoring metrics are not properly reset between runs in the same interactive session. This is a known issue when using interactive environments like IPython or Jupyter, especially with certain TensorFlow versions.\n\nHere are a few approaches you can try to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Restart the IPython Console**: Since restarting the IPython console resolves the problem temporarily, make it a habit to restart the console before running TensorFlow code again. This will clear the session state and any lingering TensorFlow metrics.\n\n2. **Update TensorFlow**: Consider updating TensorFlow to a more stable release version if possible. As of your setup, you're using a release candidate (2.0.0-rc2), which might have specific bugs. Upgrading to the latest stable version might resolve this issue.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade tensorflow\n   ```\n\n3. **Use a Virtual Environment**: Sometimes, package conflicts can cause unexpected behavior. Consider using a virtual environment to isolate your Python setup. This can help ensure that you have a clean and controlled environment for your TensorFlow projects.\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n   pip install tensorflow\n   ```\n\n4. **Try Alternative IDEs**: If the problem persists in Spyder, try running your code in another environment like Jupyter Notebook or a standalone script executed from the terminal. This might help identify if the issue is specific to Spyder's handling of the IPython console.\n\n5. **Check for Known Issues**: Look at the TensorFlow GitHub repository for any similar issues reported by others. There might be specific workarounds or patches suggested by the developers.\n\n6. **Downgrade TensorFlow**: If the latest version is not an option, consider downgrading to a version that is known to work better with your setup.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install tensorflow==2.0.0\n   ```\n\nIf none of these solutions work, you might want to consider opening an issue on the TensorFlow GitHub page with specific details about your setup and the error message. This can help the developers address the issue in future releases."
