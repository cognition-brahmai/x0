I have been able to get a reasonable PNG output using the `pyplot.figure.figimage` command as shown in the code below. However, I am wondering if there is a simpler way to achieve this, perhaps with a function that takes the array and colormap as parameters. Is there a more straightforward solution to this problem?\n\n```python\ndpi = 100.0\nw, h = myarray.shape[1]/dpi, myarray.shape[0]/dpi\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(w,h), dpi=dpi)\nfig.figimage(sub, cmap=cm.gist_earth)\nplt.savefig('out.png')\n```\n\nI am hoping for a solution that works along the lines of the following pseudocode:\n\n```python\ncolored_PIL_image = magic_function(array, cmap)\n```"

        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this by using the `matplotlib` library in combination with `PIL` to apply a colormap to a NumPy array and convert it to an RGB image. Here's a concise function that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import cm\nfrom PIL import Image\n\ndef convert_array_to_colored_image(array, cmap_name='viridis'):\n    # Normalize the array to the range [0, 1]\n    norm_array = (array - np.min(array)) / (np.max(array) - np.min(array))\n    \n    # Get the colormap\n    colormap = cm.get_cmap(cmap_name)\n    \n    # Apply the colormap and convert to RGB\n    colored_array = colormap(norm_array)\n    \n    # Convert the array to 8-bit values (0-255) and discard the alpha channel\n    image_data = (colored_array[:, :, :3] * 255).astype(np.uint8)\n    \n    # Create a PIL image from the result\n    colored_image = Image.fromarray(image_data)\n    \n    return colored_image\n\n# Example usage:\ncolored_PIL_image = convert_array_to_colored_image(myarray, 'gist_earth')\ncolored_PIL_image.save('out.png')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Normalization**: The array is first normalized to the range of [0, 1] to appropriately apply the colormap.\n- **Colormap Application**: Using `matplotlib.cm.get_cmap`, the colormap is applied to the normalized array, which returns an RGBA array.\n- **Conversion to RGB**: The RGBA array is converted to RGB by discarding the alpha channel and scaling the RGB values to 8-bit integer values (0-255).\n- **PIL Image**: The RGB image data is converted into a PIL image using `Image.fromarray`.\n\nThis function provides a simple and reusable approach to convert a grayscale NumPy array to a colored PIL image using any available matplotlib colormap."
