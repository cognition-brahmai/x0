I am noticing that the dtype for my numpy array is coming as int32 by default, even though my system is 64bit. Here is the code I am using and its output:\n\n```python\nimport numpy.distutils.system_info as sysinfo\nimport numpy as np\nimport platform\n\nsysinfo.platform_bits \nplatform.architecture()\n\nmy_array = np.array([0,1,2,3])\nmy_array.dtype\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```python\nsysinfo.platform_bits \nOut[31]: 64\n\nplatform.architecture()\nOut[32]: ('64bit', 'WindowsPE')\n\nmy_array = np.array([0,1,2,3])\nmy_array.dtype\nOut[33]: dtype('int32')\n```\n\nWhy is the default array type int32 instead of int64?"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is due to the way NumPy handles integer types on different platforms and architectures. Even though your system is 64-bit, NumPy defaults to using `int32` for integer arrays in certain situations, especially on Windows. This can happen for several reasons:\n\n1. **Platform Specific Defaults**: On Windows, NumPy often defaults to `int32` for integer arrays because it ensures compatibility with a wide range of software and systems that expect 32-bit integers. This is a safe default since many Windows applications historically used 32-bit integers.\n\n2. **Python's Integer Type**: In Python, the default integer type is typically mapped to the C `long` type on most platforms. On Windows, a C `long` is usually 32 bits, which is why `int32` is chosen as the default dtype for small integers.\n\n3. **Efficiency and Memory Usage**: Using `int32` is more memory efficient than using `int64`, especially if you don't need the larger range of `int64`. For many applications, `int32` provides sufficient range and precision, so it's often used unless there's a specific need for larger integers.\n\nIf you specifically need `int64` integers, you can specify the dtype when creating the array, like this:\n\n```python\nmy_array = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3], dtype=np.int64)\n```\n\nThis will ensure that your array uses 64-bit integers, irrespective of the platform defaults."
