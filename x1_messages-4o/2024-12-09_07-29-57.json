In Python 2, I used to split a string into lines using the following code:\n\n```python\nrest = \"some\\nlines\"\nfor line in rest.split(\"\\n\"):\n    print line\n```\nNow, after some regex processing, I have a byte array in `rest` and I need to iterate the lines. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "In Python 3, byte strings and regular strings are treated differently, so you'll need to adjust your approach when working with byte strings. You can split a byte string into lines using the `splitlines()` method, which is available for both regular and byte strings. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nrest = b\"some\\nlines\"\nfor line in rest.splitlines():\n    print(line)\n```\n\nHere's what's happening in this code:\n\n- `b\"some\\nlines\"` is a byte string. The `b` prefix indicates that this is a byte string in Python 3.\n- The `splitlines()` method splits the byte string at line boundaries and returns a list of the lines.\n- You can then iterate over this list using a `for` loop.\n\nIf you specifically need to decode the byte string to a regular string before processing, you can do so using the `decode()` method:\n\n```python\nrest = b\"some\\nlines\"\nfor line in rest.decode('utf-8').split(\"\\n\"):\n    print(line)\n```\n\nIn this case, `decode('utf-8')` converts the byte string to a regular string using the UTF-8 encoding, and then you can split it using the newline character as you did in Python 2."
