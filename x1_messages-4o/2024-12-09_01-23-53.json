Most of the solutions I found online pertain to deleting environments created with `virtualenv` or `pyvenv`, but not with `venv`."

        "content": "Deleting a virtual environment created with `venv` in Python is quite straightforward. Since the virtual environment is essentially a directory containing files and subdirectories necessary for the virtual environment to function, you can simply delete this directory to remove the virtual environment.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Locate the Directory**: First, identify the location of the virtual environment directory. This is the directory you specified when creating the virtual environment.\n\n2. **Delete the Directory**: You can delete the directory using your file explorer or by using a command in the terminal or command prompt. \n\n   - **Using Command Line**:\n     - On Unix or MacOS, you can use the `rm -rf` command:\n       ```bash\n       rm -rf /path/to/your/venv\n       ```\n     - On Windows, you can use the `rmdir` command:\n       ```cmd\n       rmdir /s /q \\path\\to\\your\\venv\n       ```\n\nThis approach is sufficient and there is no additional process required to delete a virtual environment created with `venv`. Once you delete the directory, the virtual environment is removed from your system."
