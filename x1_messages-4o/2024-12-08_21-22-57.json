It is used in computing and mathematics to process data, perform calculations, automate reasoning, and make decisions. Algorithms can range from simple instructions, like sorting a list of numbers, to complex operations, like recognizing patterns in large datasets. They are essential in programming and are implemented in software to achieve desired outcomes efficiently and effectively."
