Why is Python designed this way, and what is the suggested way to store information that the descriptor needs but is per instance? For instance, in the example code below, each object has multiple `Prop` instances and I would need to use unique names to identify the values and multipliers. Having a per instance descriptor object would allow to store the `_multiplier` (and the `_value`) in the descriptor itself, simplifying a few things.\n\n```python\nclass Prop(object):\n\n    def __get__(self, obj, objtype=None):\n        if obj is None:\n            return self\n        return obj._value * obj._multiplier\n\n    def __set__(self, obj, value):\n        if obj is None:\n            return self\n        obj._value = value\n\nclass Obj(object):\n\n    val = Prop()\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._value = 1\n        self._multiplier = 0\n```"

        "content": "In Python, descriptors are designed to be class-level constructs rather than instance-level ones. This design choice is intentional and aligns with the purpose of descriptors: to manage attribute access at the class level, enabling features like computed properties, method binding, and more. Let's delve into why descriptors are class-level and how you can achieve the desired behavior.\n\n### Why Descriptors are Class-Level:\n\n1. **Efficiency and Consistency**: Descriptors are defined at the class level to maintain consistency across instances and reduce memory overhead. Since the descriptor logic is shared among all instances, it allows for efficient memory usage.\n\n2. **Uniform Behavior**: By having descriptors at the class level, Python ensures uniform behavior across all instances of a class. This aligns with the principle that the behavior of attributes should be consistent regardless of the instance.\n\n3. **Reuse and Composition**: Descriptors provide a way to encapsulate reusable attribute logic that can be easily shared across different classes, promoting code reuse and composition.\n\n### Storing Per-Instance Data:\n\nTo store information that a descriptor needs on a per-instance basis, you can use a combination of instance attributes and a data structure, such as a dictionary, to map instances to their specific data. Here's one way to achieve this using instance-specific storage:\n\n```python\nclass Prop(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize an empty dictionary to store instance-specific data\n        self.data = {}\n\n    def __get__(self, obj, objtype=None):\n        if obj is None:\n            return self\n        # Retrieve the instance-specific data using `id(obj)` as the key\n        return self.data.get(id(obj), {}).get('value', 0) * self.data.get(id(obj), {}).get('multiplier', 1)\n\n    def __set__(self, obj, value):\n        if obj is None:\n            return self\n        # Set the instance-specific data using `id(obj)` as the key\n        if id(obj) not in self.data:\n            self.data[id(obj)] = {'value': 0, 'multiplier': 1}\n        self.data[id(obj)]['value'] = value\n\n    def set_multiplier(self, obj, multiplier):\n        # Set the multiplier for the specific instance\n        if id(obj) not in self.data:\n            self.data[id(obj)] = {'value': 0, 'multiplier': 1}\n        self.data[id(obj)]['multiplier'] = multiplier\n\nclass Obj(object):\n    val = Prop()\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.val.set_multiplier(self, 2)\n\n# Example usage\nobj1 = Obj()\nobj2 = Obj()\n\nobj1.val = 5\nobj2.val = 10\n\nprint(obj1.val)  # Output: 10\nprint(obj2.val)  # Output: 20\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Use of `id(obj)`**: This approach uses the `id(obj)` as a key to store and retrieve data specific to each instance. This avoids conflicts and ensures that each instance has its own data.\n\n- **Encapsulation**: The descriptor encapsulates the logic for managing instance-specific data, keeping the implementation details hidden from the main class.\n\n- **Flexibility**: You can extend this concept by adding more methods to manage other instance-specific attributes if needed.\n\nBy employing these techniques, you can effectively manage per-instance data while leveraging Python's descriptor protocol."
