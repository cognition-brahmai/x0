In my example, I get a result like this:\n\n```\n[[  4.65761066e-03   9.95342389e-01]\n [  9.75851270e-01   2.41487300e-02]\n [  9.99983374e-01   1.66258341e-05]]\n```\n\nFrom different computations using the sigmoid function, I know that the second column represents probabilities. However, the scikit-learn's documentation states that the first column represents `n_samples` which seems incorrect as my samples are texts, not numbers. The documentation also mentions that the second column represents `n_classes`, which can't be true as I only have two classes (`+1` and `-1`). The function is supposed to calculate the probabilities of samples belonging to a class, not the classes themselves. So, what does the first column truly signify and why is it there?"

        "content": "The `LogisticRegression.predict_proba` function in scikit-learn is designed to return the probabilities of each sample belonging to each class for a binary or multiclass classification problem. When you call this function, it provides an array where each row corresponds to a sample, and each column corresponds to a class.\n\nGiven your example output:\n\n```\n[[  4.65761066e-03   9.95342389e-01]\n [  9.75851270e-01   2.41487300e-02]\n [  9.99983374e-01   1.66258341e-05]]\n```\n\nHere's what the columns represent:\n\n- **First Column**: This column represents the probability of each sample belonging to the first class (let's say class `-1` if that's how your classes are ordered internally by scikit-learn). These are essentially the probabilities that the logistic regression model assigns to the first class.\n\n- **Second Column**: This column represents the probability of each sample belonging to the second class (let's say class `+1`). These probabilities are the complement of the probabilities in the first column for binary classification, i.e., each row's probabilities in both columns will sum to 1.\n\nIn a binary classification context with two classes, scikit-learn typically orders these classes lexicographically. If your classes are labeled `-1` and `+1`, the first column likely represents the probability of the sample being class `-1`, and the second column represents the probability of being class `+1`.\n\nThe documentation might be confusing if it's interpreted without this context. \"n_samples\" refers to the number of rows in the output, each row corresponding to a sample from your dataset. \"n_classes\" refers to the number of columns, each column corresponding to a class.\n\nIn summary, the first column in your result represents the probability of each sample being in the first class, and the second column represents the probability of each sample being in the second class. Together, they sum up to 1 for each sample in a binary classification task."
