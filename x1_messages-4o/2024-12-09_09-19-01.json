Assuming that the \"users\" table has a column named \"country\" that stores the country of each user, here is how you can write the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT country, COUNT(*) AS user_count\nFROM users\nGROUP BY country;\n```\n\nThis query selects the \"country\" column and counts the number of users for each country, grouping the results by the \"country\" column. The `COUNT(*)` function returns the total number of users for each country, and the results are displayed with the country name and the corresponding user count."
