However, I am encountering an error that says \"global name 'foo' is not defined\". Why is this happening and how can I rectify it? Here is my code:\n\n```python\nimport timeit\n\ndef foo():\n    # ... contains code I want to time ...\n\ndef dotime():\n    t = timeit.Timer(\"foo()\")\n    time = t.timeit(1)\n    print \"took %fs\\n\" % (time,)\n\ndotime()\n```\n\nThe error I am getting is:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 3, in dotime\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.6/timeit.py\", line 193, in timeit\n    timing = self.inner(it, self.timer)\n  File \"<timeit-src>\", line 6, in inner\nNameError: global name 'foo' is not defined\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the `timeit.Timer` class is trying to execute the string `\"foo()\"` in a context where `foo` is not defined. By default, the `timeit` module executes the code string within an isolated namespace where your function `foo` is not directly accessible.\n\nTo solve this issue, you need to pass the function `foo` into the `timeit.Timer` object using the `globals` parameter. This can be done by providing the current global namespace to the `Timer` object. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport timeit\n\ndef foo():\n    # ... contains code I want to time ...\n    pass  # Replace 'pass' with your actual code\n\ndef dotime():\n    t = timeit.Timer(\"foo()\", globals=globals())\n    execution_time = t.timeit(1)\n    print(\"took %fs\\n\" % (execution_time,))\n\ndotime()\n```\n\nIn this modified code, by using `globals=globals()`, you allow the `timeit` module to access the `foo` function defined in the global scope. With this adjustment, your code should work as expected, and you should be able to measure the execution time of the `foo` function without encountering the \"global name 'foo' is not defined\" error."
