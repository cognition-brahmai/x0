        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error message you're encountering indicates that Docker Compose is having trouble connecting to the Docker daemon. This is likely due to a configuration issue with Docker Toolbox, which is a legacy tool for running Docker on older Windows systems without native support for Docker.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to try to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Docker Machine Status**: Ensure that your Docker Machine is up and running. Open the Docker Quickstart Terminal and run:\n   ```sh\n   docker-machine ls\n   ```\n   Make sure the `default` machine is running. If not, start it with:\n   ```sh\n   docker-machine start default\n   ```\n\n2. **Set Environment Variables**: After starting the Docker Machine, you need to set the environment variables so that Docker Compose can communicate with the Docker daemon. Run:\n   ```sh\n   docker-machine env default\n   ```\n   Then execute the provided command to configure your shell (e.g., `eval $(docker-machine env default)`).\n\n3. **Check Network Settings**: Sometimes network settings can interfere. Make sure that your network adapters are configured correctly. You can try disabling any network adapters that you are not using.\n\n4. **Reinstall Docker Toolbox**: If the above steps don\u2019t work, consider reinstalling Docker Toolbox. Make sure to use the latest version compatible with your system.\n\n5. **Check for Conflicting Software**: Ensure there is no software that might be conflicting with Docker, such as other virtualization software.\n\n6. **Ensure Correct Python Version**: Since Docker Toolbox uses its internal environment, the Python version on your system might not directly affect it. However, if you\u2019re using any Python scripts, ensure they are compatible with the version of Docker Compose you have installed.\n\n7. **Switch to Docker Desktop**: If possible, consider upgrading to Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, or Education edition to use Docker Desktop, which provides a more seamless experience with native Docker support.\n\n8. **Review Docker Logs**: Check the logs for more information on what might be causing the issue. You can find logs in the Docker Toolbox installation directory or use the command:\n   ```sh\n   docker logs\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to pinpoint and resolve the issue. If the problem persists, consider checking forums or the Docker community for similar issues specific to Docker Toolbox configurations."
