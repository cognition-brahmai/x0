I like fruit...and milk\", I want to replace every punctuation like \"!\", \".\", \",\", \";\" etc. with white space. I tried using the translate() function as follows:\n\n```python\ntweet = \"I am tired! I like fruit...and milk\"\nclean_words = tweet.translate(None, \",.;@#?!&amp;$\")\nwords = clean_words.split()\n\nprint(tweet)\nprint(words)\n```\n\nHowever, the output I get is:\n\n```python\n['I', 'am', 'tired', 'I', 'like', 'fruitand', 'milk']\n```\n\nAs you can see, \"fruitand\" should be two separate words \"fruit\" and \"and\". How can I modify my code to replace the punctuation with white space?"

        "content": "To replace punctuation in a string with white space in Python, you can use the `str.maketrans()` method combined with `translate()`. This approach allows you to map each punctuation character to a space. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired result:\n\n```python\ntweet = \"I am tired! I like fruit...and milk\"\n\n# Create a translation table mapping each punctuation character to a space\ntranslation_table = str.maketrans(\",.;@#?!&$amp\", \" \" * len(\",.;@#?!&$amp\"))\n\n# Translate the string using the translation table\nclean_words = tweet.translate(translation_table)\n\n# Split the resulting string into words\nwords = clean_words.split()\n\nprint(tweet)\nprint(words)\n```\n\nIn the `maketrans` function, we're creating a translation table where each punctuation character is mapped to a space. The `translate` function then uses this table to replace each specified punctuation character in the string with a space. Finally, using `split()` will separate the words based on spaces, resulting in the desired list of words."
