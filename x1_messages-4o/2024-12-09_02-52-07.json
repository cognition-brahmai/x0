I am using the 'cut' command as follows: `cat text.txt | cut -d \" \" -f 4`. However, 'cut' doesn't treat multiple spaces as one delimiter. I know that I could use 'awk' with `awk '{ printf $4; }'` or 'sed' with `sed  -E \"s/[[:space:]]+/ /g\"` to collapse the spaces, but is there any way to handle this with 'cut' and multiple delimiters natively?"

        "content": "The `cut` command does not natively support treating consecutive delimiters as a single one. It always treats each instance of the specified delimiter separately. However, you can achieve the desired result by using a combination of tools to preprocess the input before using `cut`.\n\nOne approach is to use `tr` or `sed` to replace multiple spaces with a single space before using `cut`. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using `tr`:**\n   ```bash\n   cat text.txt | tr -s ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f 4\n   ```\n\n   The `tr -s ' '` command squeezes multiple spaces into a single space.\n\n2. **Using `sed`:**\n   ```bash\n   cat text.txt | sed 's/  */ /g' | cut -d ' ' -f 4\n   ```\n\n   The `sed 's/  */ /g'` command replaces one or more spaces with a single space.\n\nThese methods preprocess the text to ensure that consecutive delimiters (spaces) are treated as one, allowing `cut` to then accurately extract the desired field."
