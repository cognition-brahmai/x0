Here's a step-by-step guide to help you do that:\n\n1. First, make sure you import the `random` module.\n2. Use the `random.choice()` function, passing your array as the argument.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# Your array\nmy_array = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n\n# Select a random element\nrandom_element = random.choice(my_array)\n\nprint(\"Randomly selected element:\", random_element)\n```\n\nThis code will print a randomly selected element from `my_array` each time you run it. If you're having trouble with this approach, make sure your array is not empty and that the `random` module is correctly imported. Let me know if you need further assistance!"
