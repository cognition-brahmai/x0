        "content": "To query the device status, specifically `SHARED_SIZE_BYTES`, and manage device states using PyCUDA's Driver Interface, you'll need to work with PyCUDA's `drv` module. This module provides access to CUDA driver API functions.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how you can achieve this:\n\n### Querying `SHARED_SIZE_BYTES`\n\nTo query `SHARED_SIZE_BYTES` (shared memory size in bytes), you will use the `drv.Device.get_attributes()` method, which allows you to retrieve various attributes of a CUDA device.\n\n```python\nimport pycuda.driver as drv\nimport pycuda.autoinit\n\n# Select a CUDA device\ndevice = drv.Device(0)  # Assuming you want to use the first device\n\n# Get device attributes\nattributes = device.get_attributes()\n\n# Get the shared memory size in bytes\nshared_memory_size = attributes[drv.device_attribute.MAX_SHARED_MEMORY_PER_BLOCK]\nprint(f\"Shared Memory Size (Bytes): {shared_memory_size}\")\n```\n\n### Checking Device State Between Operations\n\nTo manage and check the device state between `malloc/memcpy` and kernel launches, you need to consider synchronization and resource management. Here's a general approach:\n\n1. **Memory Allocation and Transfer:**\n   - Use `drv.mem_alloc()` and `drv.memcpy_htod()` for memory allocation and host-to-device data transfer, respectively.\n   \n2. **Kernel Launch:**\n   - Use `drv.LaunchKernel()` to launch your kernel.\n\n3. **Synchronization:**\n   - Use `drv.Context.synchronize()` to ensure all operations are completed. This is crucial for operations that depend on the results of previous operations.\n\n4. **Querying Multiprocessor Count:**\n   - To handle devices that support multiple kernels efficiently, you might want to query the number of multiprocessors or other relevant attributes.\n\nHere\u2019s an example:\n\n```python\nimport pycuda.driver as drv\nimport pycuda.autoinit\nimport numpy as np\nfrom pycuda.compiler import SourceModule\n\n# Example kernel\nmod = SourceModule(\"\"\"\n__global__ void my_kernel(float *a, float *b, float *c)\n{\n    int idx = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;\n    c[idx] = a[idx] + b[idx];\n}\n\"\"\")\n\n# Allocate memory on the device\nn = 1024\na = np.random.randn(n).astype(np.float32)\nb = np.random.randn(n).astype(np.float32)\nc = np.empty_like(a)\n\na_gpu = drv.mem_alloc(a.nbytes)\nb_gpu = drv.mem_alloc(b.nbytes)\nc_gpu = drv.mem_alloc(c.nbytes)\n\n# Transfer data to the device\ndrv.memcpy_htod(a_gpu, a)\ndrv.memcpy_htod(b_gpu, b)\n\n# Get the kernel function\nmy_kernel = mod.get_function(\"my_kernel\")\n\n# Launch the kernel\nblock_size = 256\ngrid_size = (n + block_size - 1) // block_size\nmy_kernel(a_gpu, b_gpu, c_gpu, block=(block_size, 1, 1), grid=(grid_size, 1))\n\n# Synchronize to ensure all operations are completed\ndrv.Context.synchronize()\n\n# Transfer the result back to host\ndrv.memcpy_dtoh(c, c_gpu)\n\n# Check the result\nprint(\"Result:\", c[:10])\n\n# Check multiprocessor count or other attributes if needed\nmultiprocessor_count = attributes[drv.device_attribute.MULTIPROCESSOR_COUNT]\nprint(f\"Multiprocessor Count: {multiprocessor_count}\")\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how to query the shared memory size, perform memory operations, launch a kernel, and synchronize the operations to ensure correct execution order. By querying and using device attributes, you can make decisions to optimize your operations for devices that support multiple kernels."
