Specifically, given an array like `[1,2,3]`, I want to generate all combinations using all elements of the array. The expected output should be as follows:\n\n```\n[[1], [2], [3]]\n[[1,2], [3]]\n[[1], [2,3]]\n[[1,3], [2]]\n[[1,2,3]]\n```"

        "content": "Generating all possible set partitions of an array involves creating different groupings of the elements such that every element is included in exactly one group. Here's a Python function that will generate all partitions for a given array using recursion:\n\n```python\ndef set_partitions(array):\n    if not array:\n        yield []\n        return\n    \n    first = array[0]\n    for smaller in set_partitions(array[1:]):\n        # Insert first in each position of smaller\n        for n, subset in enumerate(smaller):\n            yield smaller[:n] + [[first] + subset] + smaller[n+1:]\n        # Or add it as a new subset\n        yield [[first]] + smaller\n\n# Example usage:\narray = [1, 2, 3]\npartitions = list(set_partitions(array))\nfor partition in partitions:\n    print(partition)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Base Case**: If the input array is empty, yield an empty partition (`[]`).\n\n2. **Recursive Case**:\n   - Take the first element of the array and recursively partition the rest of the array.\n   - For each partition of the rest of the array, try to add the first element to each existing subset.\n   - Also, consider the case where the first element starts a new subset.\n\nThis code will output all the partitions of the input array, as you described:\n\n```\n[[1, 2, 3]]\n[[1, 2], [3]]\n[[1, 3], [2]]\n[[1], [2, 3]]\n[[1], [2], [3]]\n```\n\nEach partition is a list of lists, with each inner list representing a subset of the partition. This approach efficiently generates all possible partitions using recursion and is simple to understand and implement."
