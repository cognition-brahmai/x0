The notebook server will temporarily stop sending output to the client in order to avoid crashing it.\" This issue seems to have been reported elsewhere. Is this error expected? If so, how can I solve it? The error message suggests changing the limit in `--NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit`. Could you guide me on how to do that?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is a common issue when trying to display large images or output large amounts of data in a Jupyter notebook. Jupyter has a default data rate limit to prevent overwhelming the notebook server, and when this limit is exceeded, you encounter the \"IOPub data rate exceeded\" error.\n\nTo resolve this, you can increase the data rate limit by changing the `iopub_data_rate_limit` setting in your Jupyter Notebook configuration. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Find your Jupyter configuration file:**\n   If you don't already have a configuration file, you can create one by running:\n   ```bash\n   jupyter notebook --generate-config\n   ```\n   This will create a `jupyter_notebook_config.py` file in your Jupyter configuration directory, typically located at `~/.jupyter/`.\n\n2. **Edit the configuration file:**\n   Open the `jupyter_notebook_config.py` file in a text editor.\n\n3. **Increase the data rate limit:**\n   Add or modify the following line in the configuration file to increase the data rate limit. You can adjust the number according to your needs:\n   ```python\n   c.NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit = 1e10  # Set this to a higher value\n   ```\n\n4. **Restart Jupyter Notebook:**\n   After saving the changes, restart your Jupyter Notebook server for the changes to take effect.\n\n5. **Try displaying the image again:**\n   Once the server is restarted, try running your code again to see if the issue is resolved.\n\nBy increasing the data rate limit, you should be able to view large images without encountering the error. However, be cautious when setting this limit too high, as it might impact the stability of your notebook server if you're working with very large data outputs frequently."
