For example, `np.random.randint(-10, 10)` returns integers with a discrete uniform distribution, while `np.random.normal(0, 0.1, 1)` returns floats with a normal distribution. I am looking for a combination of these two functions."

        "content": "To generate a random integer with a normal distribution centered around 0, you can combine the normal distribution sampling with rounding to the nearest integer. Here\u2019s how you can do it using NumPy:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Parameters\nmean = 0      # Mean of the normal distribution\nstd_dev = 3   # Standard deviation, adjust as needed for your spread\nsize = 1      # Number of samples to draw\n\n# Generate a random float from a normal distribution\nrandom_float = np.random.normal(mean, std_dev, size)\n\n# Round the float to the nearest integer\nrandom_integer = np.round(random_float).astype(int)\n\nprint(random_integer)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n- `np.random.normal(mean, std_dev, size)` generates a float from a normal distribution with the specified mean and standard deviation.\n- `np.round(random_float)` rounds the float to the nearest integer.\n- `astype(int)` ensures the result is an integer type.\n\nYou can adjust the `std_dev` parameter to control how spread out your integers will be around the mean. This method will give you integers that follow a normal distribution pattern centered around the specified mean."
