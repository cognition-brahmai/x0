For instance, I have a script that counts the area and volume of an ellipsoid and presents the output using the `print` function as shown below:\n\n```python\nprint('Dims: {}x{}m\\nArea: {}m^2\\nVolume: {}m^3'.format(a, round(b,2), P, V))\n```\nThe output with sample data is as follows:\n```\nDims: 13.49x2.25m\nArea: 302.99m^2\nVolume: 90.92m^3\n```\nI am aware that in markdown cells, the `$` operators can be used to create LaTeX formulas. However, I am seeking a method to do this in Python code cells."

        "content": "In a Jupyter Notebook, you can use the `IPython.display` module to render LaTeX formulas directly from a Python code cell. Specifically, you can use the `Math` or `display` function from this module to achieve the desired output. Here's how you can modify your script to display the output as LaTeX:\n\n1. First, import the necessary modules.\n2. Use the `Math` function to format your strings as LaTeX and display them.\n\nHere's the modified code:\n\n```python\nfrom IPython.display import display, Math\n\n# Sample data\na = 13.49\nb = 2.25\nP = 302.99\nV = 90.92\n\n# Create the LaTeX string\nlatex_str = r\"\"\"\nDims: {} \\times {} \\, \\text{{m}} \\\\\n\\text{{Area}}: {} \\, \\text{{m}}^2 \\\\\n\\text{{Volume}}: {} \\, \\text{{m}}^3\n\"\"\".format(a, round(b, 2), P, V)\n\n# Display the LaTeX string\ndisplay(Math(latex_str))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `r\"\"\"...\"\"\"` syntax is used to create a raw multi-line string in Python, which is helpful for writing LaTeX expressions.\n- The `\\times` command in LaTeX is used to denote multiplication.\n- The `\\,` command inserts a small space for better presentation.\n- The `\\text{}` command is used to insert regular text within the LaTeX math environment.\n- Finally, the `display(Math(latex_str))` call renders the formatted string as LaTeX.\n\nWhen you run this code cell in a Jupyter Notebook, it will display the dimensions, area, and volume as a nicely formatted LaTeX formula."
