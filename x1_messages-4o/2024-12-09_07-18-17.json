        "content": "To update a boolean field named `active` for all objects in a queryset in Django, you can use the `update()` method provided by Django's QuerySet API. This method allows you to efficiently update all records in the queryset with the specified field value. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Assuming you have already retrieved the queryset as follows:\nqs = MyModel.objects.filter(...)\n\n# Update the 'active' field to False for all objects in the queryset\nqs.update(active=False)\n```\n\nThis single line will set the `active` field to `False` for all the objects in the queryset. The `update()` method sends a single SQL query to the database, making it more efficient than iterating over the queryset and updating each object individually. Remember to replace the `filter(...)` part with your actual filtering criteria."
