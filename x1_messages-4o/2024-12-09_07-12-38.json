        "content": "In Python, you can achieve similar functionality using the built-in `logging` module, which allows you to include file name, function name, and line number in your log messages. Here's how you can set it up:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\n# Configure the logging\nlogging.basicConfig(\n    level=logging.DEBUG,\n    format='FILE: %(filename)s, FUNC: %(funcName)s, LINE: %(lineno)d, LOG: %(message)s'\n)\n\ndef my_function():\n    log_message = \"This is a debug message\"\n    logging.debug(log_message)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    my_function()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`logging.basicConfig(...)`**: This function configures the logging system in Python. You can specify the logging level and the format of the log messages.\n- **`level=logging.DEBUG`**: Sets the logging level to DEBUG, which means all messages with a severity level of DEBUG and above will be logged.\n- **`format='...'`**: Defines the format of the log messages. You can include various attributes using the `%(attribute)s` syntax:\n  - `%(filename)s`: Name of the file where the log call was made.\n  - `%(funcName)s`: Name of the function from which the log call was made.\n  - `%(lineno)d`: Line number in the source code where the log call was made.\n  - `%(message)s`: The actual log message.\n\nIn the example above, when `my_function()` is called, it logs a debug message that includes the file name, function name, and line number, similar to how you would do it in C++. You can adjust the level and format to suit your needs."
