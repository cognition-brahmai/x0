        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely due to a mismatch in the Python environments. Jupyter Notebook is running in one environment where PyTorch is installed, while your console might be using a different environment where PyTorch is not installed. Here\u2019s how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Python Environments:**\n   First, you need to make sure that you are using the same Python environment in both Jupyter Notebook and the console.\n\n2. **Identify the Jupyter Notebook Environment:**\n   Within a Jupyter Notebook, run the following command to identify the environment:\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   print(sys.executable)\n   ```\n   This will print the path to the Python interpreter being used by Jupyter Notebook.\n\n3. **Activate the Correct Environment in the Console:**\n   Once you know which environment is being used by Jupyter, activate that same environment in your console. If you're using Conda, you can activate the environment with:\n   ```bash\n   conda activate <environment_name>\n   ```\n   Replace `<environment_name>` with the name of the environment that Jupyter is using.\n\n4. **Install PyTorch in the Console Environment:**\n   If the console is using a different environment and you want to keep it that way, you'll need to install PyTorch in that environment as well. Use the same installation commands you used previously, but make sure the correct environment is active.\n\n5. **Use the Full Path to Python:**\n   Alternatively, you can use the full path to the Python executable from Jupyter in your console to ensure you are using the same environment. For example:\n   ```bash\n   /path/to/jupyter/python your_script.py\n   ```\n   Replace `/path/to/jupyter/python` with the path obtained from the `sys.executable` command.\n\n6. **Check Environment Variables:**\n   Ensure that your PATH environment variable is correctly set so that the right Python executable is being picked up by default in the console.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to run your PyTorch scripts from the console without encountering the \"No module named 'torch'\" error."
