Although the processes are created successfully (I have 8 CPUs and 8 processes are being created), they always seem to take only one physical CPU. I have tried using multiple docker options like --cpus or --cpuset when launching, but to no avail. Is this an issue related to Docker, Python, or the OS? My Docker version is 1.13.1. Here is the Python code I am using:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.externals.joblib.parallel import Parallel, delayed\nimport multiprocessing\nimport pandas\nimport numpy\nfrom scipy.stats import linregress\nimport random\nimport logging\n\ndef applyParallel(dfGrouped, func):\n    retLst = Parallel(n_jobs=multiprocessing.cpu_count())(delayed(func)(group) for name, group in dfGrouped)\n    return pandas.concat(retLst)\n\ndef compute_regression(df):\n    result = {}\n\n    (slope,intercept,rvalue,pvalue,stderr) = linregress(df.date,df.value)\n    result[\"slope\"] = [slope]\n    result[\"intercept\"] = [intercept]\n\n    return pandas.DataFrame(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG,\n                    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n    logging.info(\"start\")\n    random_list = []\n    for i in range(1,10000):\n        for j in range(1,100):\n            random_list.append({\"id\":i,\"date\":j,\"value\":random.random()})\n\n    df = pandas.DataFrame(random_list)\n\n    df = applyParallel(df.groupby('id'), compute_regression)\n\n    logging.info(\"end\")\n```\n\nWhen I run cpu_count(), the result shows 8 which is correct:\n\n```python\n>>> import multiprocessing\n>>> multiprocessing.cpu_count()\n8\n```\n\nHowever, during the run, the main process and the 8 child processes are visible but the CPU percentages seem unusual and when I change to 4 processes, total amount of CPU used always remains the same. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering might be related to how Docker and your operating system handle CPU allocation and scheduling. Here are a few points to consider and potential solutions:\n\n1. **Docker Version**: Your Docker version (1.13.1) is quite old. It's worthwhile to upgrade to a more recent version if possible, as there have been many performance improvements and bug fixes in later releases.\n\n2. **Resource Allocation**:\n   - Ensure that Docker has been allocated enough resources. On systems like macOS and Windows, Docker runs inside a virtual machine, and you need to configure the VM to use more CPUs.\n   - Use `--cpus` to limit the CPU usage. If you want to specify a fraction of CPU resources, use something like `--cpus=2.5` to allocate 2.5 CPUs.\n   - Use `--cpuset-cpus` to bind the container to specific CPUs. This might help in controlling which CPUs the processes should run on.\n\n3. **Python Multiprocessing in Docker**: \n   - Python's multiprocessing might not always distribute processes across CPUs efficiently inside Docker, especially if Docker's resource configuration is limiting or if there are other constraints.\n   - When using multiprocessing, ensure that your container is not being limited by cgroups or other resource constraints that might be set by default.\n\n4. **Linux CPU Scheduler**:\n   - The Linux kernel's CPU scheduler might decide to prioritize certain processes or to keep processes on the same CPU to improve cache performance. This is generally beneficial, but it might not be ideal for your use case if you're trying to maximize CPU usage.\n   - Experiment with different CPU scheduling policies or priorities, although this usually requires administrative privileges.\n\n5. **Profile Your Application**:\n   - Use tools like `top`, `htop`, or `docker stats` to monitor CPU usage and see if any processes are getting pinned to a particular CPU.\n   - Log CPU usage within your application to get more insight into how your processes are being distributed.\n\n6. **Alternative Libraries**:\n   - Consider using other parallelism libraries like `concurrent.futures` or `dask`, which might handle concurrency differently and could potentially yield better results in a Dockerized environment.\n\n7. **Docker CPU Quotas**:\n   - Check if your Docker daemon or your orchestration platform is applying any CPU quotas or limits that might be restricting CPU usage.\n\n8. **Try Running Outside Docker**:\n   - As a diagnostic step, try running your script outside of Docker to see if the issue persists. If the problem disappears, it's likely related to Docker's configuration or limitations.\n\nBy troubleshooting through these suggestions, you should be able to identify whether the issue lies with Docker, Python, or the OS, and adjust accordingly to achieve better CPU distribution for your multiprocessing tasks."
