I have a simple upload form which successfully uploads an image file but when I try to display it in the `template.html` file, the image always appears as a broken link symbol. I've tried various paths but it seems I might be doing something wrong. How can I correctly pass the uploaded image file to `template.html` so it displays correctly?\n\nHere is the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom flask import Flask, request, redirect, url_for, send_from_directory, \n                  render_template\n\nUPLOAD_FOLDER = '/home/me/Desktop/projects/flask/uploads'\nALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = set(['txt', 'pdf', 'png', 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'gif'])\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = UPLOAD_FOLDER\n\ndef allowed_file(filename):\n    return '.' in filename and \\\n           filename.rsplit('.', 1)[1] in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS\n\n@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef upload_file():\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        file = request.files['file']\n        if file and allowed_file(file.filename):\n            filename = secure_filename(file.filename)\n            file.save(os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename))\n            return redirect(url_for('uploaded_file', filename=filename))\n    return '''\n    <!doctype html>\n    <title>Upload new File</title>\n    <h1>Upload new File</h1>\n    <form action=\"\" method=post enctype=multipart/form-data>\n      <p><input type=file name=file>\n         <input type=submit value=Upload>\n    </form>\n    '''\n\n@app.route('/uploads/<filename>')\ndef uploaded_file(filename):\n    filename = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/uploads/' + filename\n    return render_template('template.html', filename = filename)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run()\n```\n\nAnd this is the `template.html` file:\n\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<title>Hello from Flask</title>\n{% if filename %}\n  <h1>some text<img src=\"{{filename}}\"> more text!</h1>\n{% else %}\n  <h1>no image for whatever reason</h1>\n{% endif %}\n```"

        "content": "It seems like you're on the right track, but there are a few common pitfalls that could be causing the image to appear as a broken link. Let's go through the steps to ensure everything is set up correctly:\n\n1. **Check File Path and URL**: Ensure that the file path and URL are correctly set up and accessible. It seems like you're using a hardcoded URL in the `uploaded_file` function. Instead, you should use `url_for` to dynamically generate the URL.\n\n2. **Static File Serving**: By default, Flask serves static files from the `static` folder. If you want to serve files from a different path, you need to use `send_from_directory` properly.\n\n3. **Secure Filenames**: Ensure you're using `secure_filename` to avoid any issues with file paths.\n\n4. **HTML Template**: Make sure your HTML template is correctly referencing the image source.\n\nHere's how you can make these adjustments:\n\n**Modify the `uploaded_file` function to use `send_from_directory`:**\n\n```python\nfrom werkzeug.utils import secure_filename\n\n@app.route('/uploads/<filename>')\ndef uploaded_file(filename):\n    return send_from_directory(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename)\n```\n\n**Update the `upload_file` function to use `url_for` correctly:**\n\n```python\n@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef upload_file():\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        file = request.files['file']\n        if file and allowed_file(file.filename):\n            filename = secure_filename(file.filename)\n            file.save(os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename))\n            # Use url_for to generate the correct URL\n            file_url = url_for('uploaded_file', filename=filename)\n            return render_template('template.html', filename=file_url)\n    return '''\n    <!doctype html>\n    <title>Upload new File</title>\n    <h1>Upload new File</h1>\n    <form action=\"\" method=post enctype=multipart/form-data>\n      <p><input type=file name=file>\n         <input type=submit value=Upload>\n    </form>\n    '''\n```\n\n**Ensure your `template.html` file is correctly set up:**\n\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<title>Hello from Flask</title>\n{% if filename %}\n  <h1>some text<img src=\"{{ filename }}\" alt=\"Uploaded Image\"> more text!</h1>\n{% else %}\n  <h1>No image for whatever reason</h1>\n{% endif %}\n```\n\n**Run the application:**\n\nEnsure your Flask application is running and accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.\n\nBy making these changes, you should be able to upload an image file and have it correctly display in your `template.html`. This setup ensures that the image path is dynamically generated and the image is served properly via Flask."
