In this case, the ages are already sorted: 19, 27, 35, 43, 52, 61, 70.\n\nSince there are 7 people in the group, the median age will be the 4th value in this ordered list because it is the middle number. \n\nLooking at the list: \n1. 19\n2. 27\n3. 35\n4. **43**\n5. 52\n6. 61\n7. 70\n\nThe 4th age is 43. \n\nNow, we need to check if 43 is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. To confirm that 43 is prime, we check that it is not divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root (approximately 6.56).\n\nThe prime numbers less than 6.56 are 2, 3, and 5. We check divisibility:\n- 43 is not divisible by 2 (since it's odd).\n- 43 is not divisible by 3 (since the sum of the digits, 4 + 3 = 7, is not divisible by 3).\n- 43 is not divisible by 5 (since it does not end in 0 or 5).\n\nSince 43 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, it is a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the median age of the group is 43, and it is indeed a prime number."
