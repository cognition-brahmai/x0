        "content": "Why is the Python `re.findall` function returning an empty list when used with a specific pattern on a particular string? I am using Python 3.4.3 and I have a source string `s = r'abc123d, hello 3.1415926, this is my book'`. My pattern is `pattern = r'-?[0-9]+(\\\\.[0-9]*)?|-?\\\\.[0-9]+'`. When I use the `re.search` function with this pattern, it gives me the correct result. However, when I use `re.findall`, it just returns an empty list. Why can't `re.findall` give me the expected list ['123', '3.1415926']?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with `re.findall` returning an empty list is related to the way capturing groups work in regular expressions. In your pattern, you have capturing groups defined by the parentheses `(\\\\.[0-9]*)?` and `(-?\\\\.[0-9]+)`. When `re.findall` encounters a pattern with capturing groups, it returns only the contents of the capturing groups, not the entire match.\n\nLet's break down your pattern: \n\n- `-?[0-9]+(\\\\.[0-9]*)?`: Matches an optional minus sign, followed by one or more digits, and optionally followed by a decimal point and zero or more digits.\n- `|`: Indicates an \"or\" condition.\n- `-?\\\\.[0-9]+`: Matches an optional minus sign, followed by a decimal point and one or more digits.\n\nWhen you have capturing groups, `re.findall` returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the contents of all capturing groups in the pattern. If you want to capture the entire match, you should avoid capturing groups or use non-capturing groups.\n\nTo fix the issue, you can modify your pattern to use non-capturing groups by using `(?:...)` instead of `(...)` for optional parts. Here's the corrected pattern:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ns = r'abc123d, hello 3.1415926, this is my book'\npattern = r'-?[0-9]+(?:\\\\.[0-9]*)?|-?\\\\.[0-9]+'\n\nmatches = re.findall(pattern, s)\nprint(matches)  # Output should be ['123', '3.1415926']\n```\n\nUsing `(?:...)` makes the group non-capturing, so `re.findall` will return the entire match as expected."
