Every time I attempt to use the learning rate finder or train the network, an error is produced. Upon investigation, it seems that the mask values are either 0 for background pixels and 255 for foreground ones. This is problematic because I only have two classes. How can I change the 255 values to 1 within my Databunch Object? Is there a way to divide each mask value by 255 or is there a method I need to implement beforehand? I attempted adding an 'after_open' function and using the div attribute within the 'open_image' function, but these solutions did not work. I also tried implementing solutions from a post I found in the fast-ai community but they also did not resolve my problem. \n\nHere is the error message:\n\n```\nRuntimeError: Assertion `cur_target >= 0 && cur_target < n_classes' failed.  at /pytorch/aten/src/THNN/generic/ClassNLLCriterion.c:97\n```\n\nMy data is set up as follows:\n\n```python\ndata = (SegmentationItemList.from_df(img_df,IMAGE_PATH)\n      .split_by_rand_pct(valid_pct=0.15)\n      .label_from_func(get_mask, classes = array(['background','cell']))\n      .transform(tfms, tfm_y=True, size=TILE_SHAPE)\n      .databunch(bs=BATCH_SIZE)\n      .normalize()\n)\n```"

        "content": "It looks like you're encountering an issue where your segmentation masks have pixel values of 0 and 255, but you need them to be 0 and 1 to match your class indices. This mismatch is causing the error. You can address this issue by ensuring that your masks are correctly processed before being fed into the `DataBunch`.\n\nTo solve this, you can create a custom transform or modify the data preprocessing step to convert the mask values from 255 to 1. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Custom Mask Transform:**\n\n   You can define a custom transformation function that modifies the mask values before they are processed by the `DataBunch`. This function can be added to the `after_open` parameter of `SegmentationItemList`.\n\n   ```python\n   from fastai.vision import *\n   import numpy as np\n\n   def modify_mask(mask: ImageSegment): \n       # Convert 255 to 1\n       mask.data = mask.data.div_(255).long()\n       return mask\n\n   # Use the custom transformation function with after_open\n   data = (SegmentationItemList.from_df(img_df, IMAGE_PATH)\n           .split_by_rand_pct(valid_pct=0.15)\n           .label_from_func(get_mask, classes=array(['background', 'cell']))\n           .transform(tfms, tfm_y=True, size=TILE_SHAPE)\n           .databunch(bs=BATCH_SIZE)\n           .normalize()\n           .add_test_folder()\n           .add_test_folder()\n           .label_from_func(get_mask, classes=array(['background', 'cell']))\n           .transform(tfms, tfm_y=True, size=TILE_SHAPE)\n           .databunch(bs=BATCH_SIZE)\n           .normalize()\n          )\n\n   data.label_cls.y.after_open = modify_mask\n   ```\n\n2. **Modify Your Masks Beforehand:**\n\n   If you have control over the data preparation step, you can preprocess your mask images to ensure they have the correct values. You can do this using any image processing library such as OpenCV or PIL. Here's an example using PIL:\n\n   ```python\n   from PIL import Image\n   import os\n\n   def preprocess_masks(mask_path):\n       mask = Image.open(mask_path)\n       mask_np = np.array(mask)\n       mask_np[mask_np == 255] = 1\n       new_mask = Image.fromarray(mask_np)\n       new_mask.save(mask_path)\n\n   # Apply the preprocessing function to all mask images\n   mask_paths = [os.path.join(MASK_PATH, f) for f in os.listdir(MASK_PATH) if f.endswith('.png')]\n   for mask_path in mask_paths:\n       preprocess_masks(mask_path)\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify the Changes:**\n\n   Ensure that your masks are correctly updated by checking the pixel values before feeding them into the `DataBunch`. This can help avoid any runtime errors related to class indices.\n\nBy implementing one of these solutions, you should be able to resolve the issue and proceed with your segmentation task using the fast-ai library."
