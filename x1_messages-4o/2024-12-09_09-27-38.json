        "content": "Certainly! To calculate the surface area of a pyramid, you need to know the area of the base and the area of the triangular faces. Here is a Python code that calculates the surface area of a pyramid with a square base:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef surface_area_of_pyramid(base_length, slant_height):\n    # Calculate the area of the base (square)\n    base_area = base_length ** 2\n    \n    # Calculate the area of one triangular face\n    triangular_face_area = 0.5 * base_length * slant_height\n    \n    # Total surface area is the base area plus four times the area of one triangular face\n    total_surface_area = base_area + 4 * triangular_face_area\n    \n    return total_surface_area\n\n# Example usage\nbase_length = float(input(\"Enter the base length of the pyramid: \"))\nslant_height = float(input(\"Enter the slant height of the pyramid: \"))\n\nsurface_area = surface_area_of_pyramid(base_length, slant_height)\nprint(f\"The surface area of the pyramid is: {surface_area}\")\n```\n\nThis code assumes that the pyramid has a square base. You need to provide the base length and the slant height of the pyramid. The slant height is the height from the base to the apex along the center of one of the triangular faces. For pyramids with different base shapes, you'll need to adjust the formula for the base area accordingly."
