        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to trying to perform arithmetic operations between a string and an integer. In your code, you're using the `input()` function to get user input, which returns a string. Therefore, both `text` and `num` are strings, and you're trying to subtract 1 from a string in `s = s - 1`, which causes the `TypeError`.\n\nTo fix this, you need to convert the `num` variable to an integer before using it in arithmetic operations. Here's the corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\ndef cat_n_times(s, n):\n    while s != 0:\n        print(n)\n        s = s - 1\n\ntext = input(\"What would you like the computer to repeat back to you: \")\nnum = int(input(\"How many times: \"))  # Convert the input to an integer\n\ncat_n_times(num, text)\n```\n\nIn this corrected code, `num` is converted to an integer using `int()`, allowing you to perform the subtraction in the `cat_n_times` function without encountering a `TypeError`."
