I want to call this function and iterate over its result. I've attempted to set the function's return value to a variable and iterate over the variable, but there doesn't seem to be a way to set a variable in a Django template. I tried using the following code but it doesn't work:\n\n```python\n{% for item in my_func(10) %} \n```\n\nIs there a normal or conventional way to do this?"

        "content": "In Django templates, you cannot directly call a Python function and pass arguments to it. However, you can achieve similar functionality by preparing the data in your Django view and then passing it to the template context. Here's a step-by-step approach to how you can do this:\n\n1. **Define the Function in Your View:**\n\n   First, define the function in your Django view that takes an argument and returns the records you need.\n\n   ```python\n   def my_func(arg):\n       # Your logic to return records\n       return SomeModel.objects.filter(some_field=arg)\n   ```\n\n2. **Use the Function in Your View:**\n\n   Call this function in your Django view and pass the result to the template context.\n\n   ```python\n   from django.shortcuts import render\n\n   def my_view(request):\n       records = my_func(10)  # Call the function with the desired argument\n       context = {\n           'records': records,\n       }\n       return render(request, 'my_template.html', context)\n   ```\n\n3. **Iterate Over the Records in Your Template:**\n\n   Now, in the Django template, you can iterate over the records that you've passed in the context.\n\n   ```html\n   {% for item in records %}\n       {{ item }}\n   {% endfor %}\n   ```\n\nBy following this method, you prepare and process the data in the view, and then pass the processed data to the template where you can easily access and iterate over it. This approach keeps the business logic in the view and the presentation logic in the template, adhering to Django's design philosophy of separating concerns."
