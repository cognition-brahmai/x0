How can I direct pip to install 'requests' for Python 3.4 even though it is already installed for Python 2.7?"

        "content": "To install the 'requests' module specifically for Python 3.4 on your Ubuntu 14.04 machine, you can use `pip3`, which is the package installer for Python 3.x. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Ensure `pip3` is installed:**\n   First, check if `pip3` is available on your system. Open the terminal and run:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip3 --version\n   ```\n\n   If it\u2019s not installed, you can install it using:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install python3-pip\n   ```\n\n2. **Install 'requests' using `pip3`:**\n   Once you have `pip3` installed, you can install the 'requests' module for Python 3.4 using:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip3 install requests\n   ```\n\nThis command will install the 'requests' library for your Python 3.4 environment, independent of the Python 2.7 installation.\n\n3. **Verify the installation:**\n   You can verify the installation by running Python 3.4 and trying to import the module:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.4 -c \"import requests; print(requests.__version__)\"\n   ```\n\nThis should confirm that 'requests' is successfully installed and available for use with Python 3.4."
