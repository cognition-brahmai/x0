        "content": "To merge two dictionaries in Python, you have several options depending on the version of Python you're using. Here are a few methods:\n\n### Method 1: Using the `update()` Method\nThis method works in all Python versions.\n\n```python\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\ndict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n\n# Create a copy of dict1 and update it with dict2\nmerged_dict = dict1.copy()\nmerged_dict.update(dict2)\n\nprint(merged_dict)\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using Dictionary Unpacking (Python 3.5+)\nThis method uses the `{**d1, **d2}` syntax which is available from Python 3.5 onwards.\n\n```python\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\ndict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n\n# Merge using dictionary unpacking\nmerged_dict = {**dict1, **dict2}\n\nprint(merged_dict)\n```\n\n### Method 3: Using the `|` Operator (Python 3.9+)\nPython 3.9 introduced the `|` operator to merge dictionaries.\n\n```python\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\ndict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n\n# Merge using the | operator\nmerged_dict = dict1 | dict2\n\nprint(merged_dict)\n```\n\n### Note:\n- In all of these methods, if there are overlapping keys, the values from the second dictionary (`dict2`) will overwrite those from the first dictionary (`dict1`).\n- Choose the method that best suits the version of Python you are using."
