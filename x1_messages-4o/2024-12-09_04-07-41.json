        "content": "In Python, you can specify new lines in a string using the newline character `\\n`. This character tells Python to move to the next line. When you write such a string to a text file, the text will appear across multiple lines. Here's an example of how you can create a multi-line string and write it to a text file:\n\n```python\n# Define a multi-line string\nmulti_line_string = \"This is the first line.\\nThis is the second line.\\nThis is the third line.\"\n\n# Open a file in write mode\nwith open('example.txt', 'w') as file:\n    # Write the multi-line string to the file\n    file.write(multi_line_string)\n```\n\nIn this example, `example.txt` will contain:\n\n```\nThis is the first line.\nThis is the second line.\nThis is the third line.\n```\n\nIf you are working with user input or dynamically created strings, you can also use triple quotes (`'''` or `\"\"\"`) to define a multi-line string directly, which automatically includes new lines where you break the lines in your code:\n\n```python\nmulti_line_string = \"\"\"This is the first line.\nThis is the second line.\nThis is the third line.\"\"\"\n```\n\nThis approach is useful for writing longer texts directly into your code without manually inserting `\\n` for each line break."
