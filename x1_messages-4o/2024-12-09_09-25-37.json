        "content": "Designing a Ruby class to handle complex numbers involves defining methods to perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Here's a simple example of how you can implement such a class:\n\n```ruby\nclass ComplexNumber\n  attr_accessor :real, :imaginary\n\n  def initialize(real, imaginary)\n    @real = real\n    @imaginary = imaginary\n  end\n\n  def +(other)\n    ComplexNumber.new(@real + other.real, @imaginary + other.imaginary)\n  end\n\n  def -(other)\n    ComplexNumber.new(@real - other.real, @imaginary - other.imaginary)\n  end\n\n  def *(other)\n    real_part = @real * other.real - @imaginary * other.imaginary\n    imaginary_part = @real * other.imaginary + @imaginary * other.real\n    ComplexNumber.new(real_part, imaginary_part)\n  end\n\n  def /(other)\n    denominator = other.real**2 + other.imaginary**2\n    real_part = (@real * other.real + @imaginary * other.imaginary) / denominator\n    imaginary_part = (@imaginary * other.real - @real * other.imaginary) / denominator\n    ComplexNumber.new(real_part, imaginary_part)\n  end\n\n  def to_s\n    \"#{@real} + #{@imaginary}i\"\n  end\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nc1 = ComplexNumber.new(3, 2)\nc2 = ComplexNumber.new(1, 7)\n\nsum = c1 + c2\ndifference = c1 - c2\nproduct = c1 * c2\nquotient = c1 / c2\n\nputs \"c1: #{c1}\"\nputs \"c2: #{c2}\"\nputs \"Sum: #{sum}\"\nputs \"Difference: #{difference}\"\nputs \"Product: #{product}\"\nputs \"Quotient: #{quotient}\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Attributes**: The class has two attributes, `real` and `imaginary`, to store the parts of a complex number.\n- **Constructor**: The `initialize` method is used to create a new complex number with a real and an imaginary part.\n- **Operations**: Methods `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` are defined to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division respectively.\n- **String Representation**: The `to_s` method is overridden to provide a string representation of the complex number in the form \"a + bi\".\n\nThis implementation allows you to create complex numbers and perform basic arithmetic operations on them. You can extend this class by adding more methods for additional functionalities, such as calculating the magnitude or conjugate of a complex number."
