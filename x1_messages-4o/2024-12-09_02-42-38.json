Now, I am getting an error saying \"new-line character seen in unquoted field - do you need to open the file in universal-newline mode?\". How can I resolve this issue?\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\nclass CSV:\n\n    def __init__(self, file=None):\n        self.file = file\n\n    def read_file(self):\n        data = []\n        file_read = csv.reader(self.file)\n        for row in file_read:\n            data.append(row)\n        return data\n\n    def get_row_count(self):\n        return len(self.read_file())\n\n    def get_column_count(self):\n        new_data = self.read_file()\n        return len(new_data[0])\n\n    def get_data(self, rows=1):\n        data = self.read_file()\n\n        return data[:rows]\n```\n\nAnd my upload configuration function is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef upload_configurator(request, id=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    A view that allows the user to configurator the uploaded CSV.\n    \"\"\"\n    upload = Upload.objects.get(id=id)\n    csvobject = CSV(upload.filepath)\n\n    upload.num_records = csvobject.get_row_count()\n    upload.num_columns = csvobject.get_column_count()\n    upload.save()\n\n    form = ConfiguratorForm()\n\n    row_count = csvobject.get_row_count()\n    colum_count = csvobject.get_column_count()\n    first_row = csvobject.get_data(rows=1)\n    first_two_rows = csvobject.get_data(rows=5)\n```"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering indicates that the CSV file might have newline characters within fields, which can cause issues when reading it if the file is not opened in the appropriate mode. This is a common issue when dealing with files from different operating systems, such as Windows, which might have different newline conventions.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can open the file in universal newline mode by using the `open` function with the `newline=''` parameter before passing it to the `csv.reader`. This allows Python to properly handle different newline conventions. You can update your code as follows:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\nclass CSV:\n\n    def __init__(self, file=None):\n        self.file = file\n\n    def read_file(self):\n        data = []\n        # Open the file using 'newline=\"\"' to handle newlines correctly\n        with open(self.file, mode='r', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:\n            file_reader = csv.reader(csvfile)\n            for row in file_reader:\n                data.append(row)\n        return data\n\n    def get_row_count(self):\n        return len(self.read_file())\n\n    def get_column_count(self):\n        new_data = self.read_file()\n        return len(new_data[0])\n\n    def get_data(self, rows=1):\n        data = self.read_file()\n\n        return data[:rows]\n```\n\nMake sure to use the `newline=''` parameter in the `open()` function when opening the CSV file. This tells Python to handle the newline characters in a universal way, which should resolve the issue you're facing. Additionally, it\u2019s a good practice to specify the encoding (like `utf-8`) when dealing with text files, especially when files can come from different systems or locales.\n\nAlso, ensure that you are passing the correct file path to the `CSV` class, and that the file exists and is accessible from the location where your script is running."
