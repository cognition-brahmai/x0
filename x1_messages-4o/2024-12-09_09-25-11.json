        "content": "Developing a web crawler in Python to collect page titles and URLs from a specific website can be achieved using libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML. Below, I'll guide you through the process step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Install Required Libraries\n\nFirst, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. You can do this using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install requests beautifulsoup4\n```\n\n### Step 2: Write the Crawler Script\n\nHere's a basic structure for your web crawler:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nfrom urllib.parse import urljoin\n\ndef fetch_page(url):\n    \"\"\"Fetch the content of a URL and return the BeautifulSoup object.\"\"\"\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    response.raise_for_status()  # Check that the request was successful\n    return BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\n\ndef get_links_and_titles(soup, base_url):\n    \"\"\"Extract and return a list of tuples containing (title, url) from the page.\"\"\"\n    links = []\n    for a_tag in soup.find_all('a', href=True):\n        title = a_tag.get_text(strip=True)\n        href = a_tag['href']\n        full_url = urljoin(base_url, href)\n        links.append((title, full_url))\n    return links\n\ndef crawl_website(start_url):\n    \"\"\"Crawl the website starting from start_url and collect page titles and URLs.\"\"\"\n    visited_urls = set()\n    urls_to_visit = [start_url]\n\n    while urls_to_visit:\n        current_url = urls_to_visit.pop(0)\n        if current_url in visited_urls:\n            continue\n\n        print(f\"Crawling: {current_url}\")\n        soup = fetch_page(current_url)\n        links = get_links_and_titles(soup, current_url)\n\n        for title, url in links:\n            if url not in visited_urls:\n                urls_to_visit.append(url)\n                print(f\"Title: {title}, URL: {url}\")\n\n        visited_urls.add(current_url)\n\n# Replace 'http://example.com' with the URL of the website you want to crawl\nstart_url = 'http://example.com'\ncrawl_website(start_url)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Run the Script\n\nReplace `'http://example.com'` with the URL of the website you want to crawl and run the script. This script will print the titles and URLs of pages it finds.\n\n### Important Notes\n\n1. **Respect Robots.txt and Terms of Service:** Before crawling any website, ensure you respect the website's `robots.txt` file and terms of service. Some websites do not allow crawling or have rate limits.\n\n2. **Handling Large Websites:** This script is basic and suitable for small websites. For larger websites, consider using a queue and multi-threading or libraries like Scrapy that are designed for more robust crawling.\n\n3. **Politeness:** Implement delays between requests to avoid overloading the server.\n\n4. **Error Handling:** Add error handling to manage broken links or request timeouts gracefully.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll have a basic web crawler to collect page titles and URLs. You can expand its functionality as needed."
