        "content": "The error message \"RuntimeError: The size of tensor a (4) must match the size of tensor b (3) at non-singleton dimension 0\" suggests that there's a mismatch in the number of channels between the image and the normalization parameters used in your transformation pipeline. This is likely happening because the input image has an unexpected number of channels.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check the Image Mode**: \n   Ensure that the input image is in RGB mode, which should have 3 channels. If the image is in a different mode (like RGBA, which has 4 channels), you need to convert it to RGB.\n\n2. **Convert Image to RGB**:\n   Modify the code to convert the image to RGB before applying transformations:\n\n   ```python\n   test_image = Image.open(test_image_name).convert('RGB')\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify Transformations**:\n   Double-check your transformation pipeline to ensure it aligns with your model's input requirements. The normalization parameters should be compatible with 3-channel images:\n\n   ```python\n   image_transforms = {\n       'test': transforms.Compose([\n           transforms.Resize((224, 224)),\n           transforms.ToTensor(),\n           transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])\n       ])\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Ensure that the `mean` and `std` lists have three values corresponding to the three channels (R, G, B).\n\n4. **Re-run the Prediction**:\n   After making these changes, try running the `predict` function again.\n\nBy converting the image to RGB and ensuring the transformations align with 3-channel images, you should be able to resolve the mismatch error. If the error persists, check the rest of your data pipeline to confirm that images are being loaded and preprocessed correctly."
