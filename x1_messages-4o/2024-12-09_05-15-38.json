The Python Distribute guide suggests including doc/txt files and excluding .py files in MANIFEST.in, while the sourcedist documentation recommends including .py files and using 'python setup.py sdist --manifest-only' to create a MANIFEST. However, Python indicates that this command doesn't exist. I am using Python 3 and the new version of setuptools and following the standard folder structure and setup.py file."

        "content": "In Python projects, a `MANIFEST.in` file is not strictly necessary, but it is often used to specify additional files to be included in your source distribution that are not automatically included by setuptools. When you create a source distribution with `python setup.py sdist`, setuptools automatically includes Python files and some standard files like `README`, `setup.py`, and any files under version control. However, if you have additional files like documentation, data files, or other resources that you want to include, you need to specify them in a `MANIFEST.in` file.\n\nHere's a basic guide on what you might include in `MANIFEST.in`:\n\n1. **Documentation Files**: Include any documentation files like `.txt` or `.md` files.\n   ```plaintext\n   include README.md\n   include doc/*.txt\n   ```\n\n2. **Data Files**: Include data files that your package needs.\n   ```plaintext\n   include data/*.dat\n   ```\n\n3. **Exclude Files**: You can also specify files or patterns to exclude.\n   ```plaintext\n   exclude *.pyc\n   ```\n\n4. **Entire Directories**: Include entire directories if needed.\n   ```plaintext\n   recursive-include examples *\n   ```\n\n5. **Specific Files**: Include specific files.\n   ```plaintext\n   include LICENSE\n   ```\n\nRegarding the `python setup.py sdist --manifest-only` command, it seems there might be some confusion or outdated information. In current versions of setuptools, there is no `--manifest-only` option. Instead, focus on ensuring your `MANIFEST.in` includes everything you need, and then create your source distribution using:\n```bash\npython setup.py sdist\n```\n\nThis will generate a source distribution tarball (`.tar.gz`) containing your package files along with any additional files specified in your `MANIFEST.in`.\n\nFor modern Python projects, consider using `setuptools` alongside `pyproject.toml` for configuration, as this is becoming the standard approach. Additionally, tools like `setuptools_scm` can help manage versioning and packaging more effectively.\n\nIn summary, while `MANIFEST.in` is not always necessary, it is useful for explicitly including non-Python files in your source distribution. Adjust it according to your project\u2019s needs."
