        "content": "The PHP code you've provided implements a basic bubble sort algorithm, which is not the most efficient sorting algorithm in terms of performance. Here are some optimizations you can apply to improve its performance and reduce memory usage:\n\n### Optimized Bubble Sort\n\n1. **Reduce `count()` calls**: The `count()` function is called multiple times within the loop, which can be inefficient. Store the count in a variable before the loops start.\n\n2. **Optimize the inner loop**: After each pass through the array, the largest element is placed at the end, so you don't need to check the last sorted elements again.\n\n3. **Add a flag for optimization**: If no elements were swapped during a pass, the array is already sorted, and you can terminate the loop early.\n\nHere's the optimized version of your bubble sort:\n\n```php\n$array = array(3, 2, 5, 1, 4);\n$n = count($array);\n\nfor ($i = 0; $i < $n; $i++) {\n  $swapped = false;\n  for ($j = 0; $j < $n - $i - 1; $j++) {\n    if ($array[$j] > $array[$j + 1]) {\n      // Swap the elements\n      $temp = $array[$j];\n      $array[$j] = $array[$j + 1];\n      $array[$j + 1] = $temp;\n      $swapped = true;\n    }\n  }\n  // If no elements were swapped, break the loop\n  if (!$swapped) {\n    break;\n  }\n}\n\nprint_r($array);\n```\n\n### Alternative Methods\n\nUsing PHP's built-in sorting functions can significantly improve performance and reduce memory usage because they are implemented in C and optimized for performance. Here's how you can sort the array using `sort()`:\n\n```php\n$array = array(3, 2, 5, 1, 4);\nsort($array);\nprint_r($array);\n```\n\nThe `sort()` function is highly efficient and uses the Quicksort algorithm under the hood, which has an average time complexity of O(n log n), making it much faster than bubble sort. Additionally, `sort()` is a stable and in-place sorting method, so it doesn't require additional memory allocation for sorting."
