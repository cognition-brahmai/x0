I understand that a semi-colon can be used to suppress display of returned objects. For instance, in the code:\n\n```python\n>>> 1+1\n2\n\n>>> 1+1;   # No output!\n```\n\nThe semi-colon successfully suppresses the output. However, when a function that prints to stdout is executed, the semi-colon does not suppress the output. For instance, in the code:\n\n```python\n>>> print('Hello!')\nHello!\n\n>>> MyFunction()\nCalculating values...\n```\n\nThe output from print() or MyFunction() is not suppressed. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To suppress output sent to `stdout` in Jupyter when running IPython, you can redirect the standard output to a null device using Python's `contextlib` module. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using `contextlib.redirect_stdout`**:\n   You can use the `contextlib.redirect_stdout` context manager to redirect the output to a null device, effectively suppressing it.\n\n   ```python\n   import contextlib\n   import os\n\n   # Define a function that prints to stdout\n   def MyFunction():\n       print(\"Calculating values...\")\n\n   # Suppress stdout\n   with contextlib.redirect_stdout(open(os.devnull, 'w')):\n       print('Hello!')\n       MyFunction()\n   ```\n\n   In this example, both `print('Hello!')` and `MyFunction()` will not produce any visible output in the Jupyter notebook.\n\n2. **Using a custom context manager**:\n   You can create a custom context manager to suppress the output more explicitly:\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   from contextlib import contextmanager\n\n   @contextmanager\n   def suppress_stdout():\n       with open(os.devnull, 'w') as devnull:\n           old_stdout = sys.stdout\n           sys.stdout = devnull\n           try:\n               yield\n           finally:\n               sys.stdout = old_stdout\n\n   # Use the custom context manager\n   with suppress_stdout():\n       print('Hello!')\n       MyFunction()\n   ```\n\n   This approach also suppresses any output to stdout within the `suppress_stdout` context.\n\nBy using either of these methods, you can suppress any output sent to stdout in Jupyter when running IPython."
