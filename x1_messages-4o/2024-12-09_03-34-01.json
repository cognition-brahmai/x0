Please install it from <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/service_identity> and make sure all of its dependencies are satisfied.  Without the service_identity module and a recent enough pyOpenSSL to support it, Twisted can perform only rudimentary TLS client hostname verification.

        "content": "The error message you're encountering indicates that the `service_identity` module is not installed in your Python environment. This module is necessary for proper TLS client hostname verification when making HTTPS connections with the Twisted networking library, which Scrapy relies on.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Install the `service_identity` module:**\n\n   You can install the `service_identity` module using `pip`, which is the Python package manager. Open a command prompt and run the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install service_identity\n   ```\n\n   Ensure that you're using the correct Python environment where Scrapy is installed. If you have multiple Python versions, you may need to specify the full path to the `pip` executable or use `pip2` if you're using Python 2.7.\n\n2. **Check and Upgrade `pyOpenSSL`:**\n\n   The warning message suggests that you might also need a recent version of `pyOpenSSL`. You can upgrade it using:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade pyOpenSSL\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify Your Installation:**\n\n   After installing `service_identity` and upgrading `pyOpenSSL`, check the installation by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   scrapy version -v\n   ```\n\n   This command should no longer produce the same error if everything is installed correctly.\n\n4. **Additional Considerations:**\n\n   - **Python Version:** You are using Python 2.7, which is no longer officially supported. Consider upgrading to a newer version of Python (3.6 or later) for better security and feature support.\n   - **Operating System:** Windows 7 is also outdated and may pose security risks. Upgrading to a more recent version of Windows is advisable for improved security and compatibility.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error and ensure that Scrapy works properly with HTTPS connections."
