My current code is as follows:\n\n```\nfor X,Y in data:\n   scatter(X, Y, c=??)\n```\n\nThe documentation states that `c` can be a single color format string, a sequence of color specifications of length N, a sequence of N numbers to be mapped to colors using the cmap and norm specified via kwargs, or a 2-D array in which the rows are RGB or RGBA. However, I'm unsure of how to generate random colors to use for this."

        "content": "To generate random colors for your scatter plots in Matplotlib, you can use the `numpy` library to create random RGB values. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Assuming 'data' is a list of tuples (X, Y)\nfor X, Y in data:\n    # Generate a random color\n    random_color = np.random.rand(3,)  # This generates a random RGB color\n    plt.scatter(X, Y, c=[random_color])\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what we're doing:\n\n- `np.random.rand(3,)` generates an array of three random numbers between 0 and 1. These numbers are used as the RGB components of a color, resulting in a random color.\n- The `c` parameter in `scatter` is set to `[random_color]`, ensuring it's interpreted as a sequence of colors even if it's just one color.\n\nThis will give each scatter plot a different random color every time you run the code.\n\nIf you want to ensure that the colors are visually distinct, you might want to consider using a predefined colormap or a set of predefined colors. However, for purely random colors, the above approach works well."
