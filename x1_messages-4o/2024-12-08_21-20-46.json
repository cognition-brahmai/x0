        "content": "To store the number of times a word appears in a document, there are several data structures you can consider, each with its own pros and cons. Let's explore some of the most common ones:\n\n### 1. HashMap (Dictionary)\n#### Pros:\n- **Fast Lookup and Insertion**: Average time complexity for both operations is O(1).\n- **Easy to Implement**: Most programming languages have built-in hash map implementations.\n- **Flexible**: Can store any type of data as keys and values.\n\n#### Cons:\n- **Memory Usage**: Can consume more memory due to hash functions and potential collisions.\n- **No Ordering**: Does not maintain any order of the keys.\n\n#### Example Scenario:\n- **Preferred for**: General-purpose applications needing quick access to word counts, like a simple word frequency counter in a text editor.\n\n#### Code Snippet (Python):\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef count_words_hashmap(document):\n    word_count = defaultdict(int)\n    for word in document.split():\n        word_count[word] += 1\n    return word_count\n\ndocument = \"apple banana apple strawberry banana apple\"\nword_count = count_words_hashmap(document)\nprint(word_count)\n```\n\n### 2. Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST)\n#### Pros:\n- **Ordered Data**: Can maintain the words in a sorted order.\n- **Range Queries**: Efficiently perform range queries for word frequencies.\n\n#### Cons:\n- **Slower Operations**: O(log n) for insertions and lookups, which is slower than hash maps.\n- **Complexity**: More complex to implement and maintain compared to hash maps.\n\n#### Example Scenario:\n- **Preferred for**: Applications where you need to frequently iterate over words in a sorted manner or perform range queries.\n\n#### Code Snippet (Python using `sortedcontainers`):\n```python\nfrom sortedcontainers import SortedDict\n\ndef count_words_bst(document):\n    word_count = SortedDict()\n    for word in document.split():\n        if word in word_count:\n            word_count[word] += 1\n        else:\n            word_count[word] = 1\n    return word_count\n\ndocument = \"apple banana apple strawberry banana apple\"\nword_count = count_words_bst(document)\nprint(word_count)\n```\n\n### 3. Trie\n#### Pros:\n- **Prefix Searches**: Efficient for problems involving prefix-based queries.\n- **Space Efficiency**: Can be more space-efficient when storing a large number of similar keys.\n\n#### Cons:\n- **Complexity**: More complex structure and harder to implement compared to hash maps.\n- **Overhead**: Can incur overhead for words that do not share common prefixes.\n\n#### Example Scenario:\n- **Preferred for**: Applications like autocomplete systems or dictionary words lookup where prefix-based queries are common.\n\n#### Code Snippet (Basic Implementation in Python):\n```python\nclass TrieNode:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.children = {}\n        self.count = 0\n\nclass Trie:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.root = TrieNode()\n\n    def insert(self, word):\n        node = self.root\n        for char in word:\n            if char not in node.children:\n                node.children[char] = TrieNode()\n            node = node.children[char]\n        node.count += 1\n\n    def search(self, word):\n        node = self.root\n        for char in word:\n            if char not in node.children:\n                return 0\n            node = node.children[char]\n        return node.count\n\ndef count_words_trie(document):\n    trie = Trie()\n    for word in document.split():\n        trie.insert(word)\n    return trie\n\ndocument = \"apple banana apple strawberry banana apple\"\ntrie = count_words_trie(document)\nprint(trie.search(\"apple\"))\nprint(trie.search(\"banana\"))\n```\n\n### Optimization for Large Datasets\nFor large documents or datasets, the focus should be on minimizing memory usage and maximizing speed. Here are some strategies:\n\n1. **Compression**: Use data compression techniques to reduce memory footprint.\n2. **Parallel Processing**: Divide the document into chunks and process in parallel.\n3. **Efficient String Handling**: Use efficient string handling techniques to reduce overhead.\n4. **Persistent Storage**: For extremely large datasets, consider using persistent storage solutions like databases.\n\n### Algorithms for Efficient Update and Query\n- **MapReduce**: For distributed processing of large datasets.\n- **Bloom Filters**: To quickly check if a word may have been seen before.\n- **Inverted Index**: Useful in information retrieval systems for quick lookups.\n\nBy choosing the right data structure and optimization techniques, you can efficiently handle word frequency counting even in large documents."
