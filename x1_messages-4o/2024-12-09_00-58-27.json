Even after configuring workspace settings to point to the fully qualified python executable as recommended, the lint error still persists. The 'protorpc' library is installed in the google-cloud-sdk/platform/google_appengine/lib path and the 'remote.py' module that cannot be imported is present in this path. I've added this path to my PYTHONPATH, but the issue still remains. The application runs both locally and when deployed, so this seems to be just a lint error. I've also installed google-endpoints to the app's lib directory as required. What could be the issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with pylint not recognizing the 'protorpc' library, even after adding the appropriate path to your PYTHONPATH, is a common problem when dealing with libraries that are not in standard locations. Here's a step-by-step guide to troubleshoot and potentially resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify PYTHONPATH**: Double-check that the PYTHONPATH is correctly set in your environment and that it includes the path to the Google App Engine libraries. You can do this by printing the PYTHONPATH in your terminal to ensure it's correctly set.\n\n   ```bash\n   echo $PYTHONPATH\n   ```\n\n   Make sure it includes something like:\n   ```\n   /path/to/google-cloud-sdk/platform/google_appengine/lib\n   ```\n\n2. **Pylint Configuration**: You might need to configure pylint specifically to include the additional paths. You can do this by creating or modifying a `.pylintrc` file in your project root directory:\n\n   ```ini\n   [MASTER]\n   init-hook='import sys; sys.path.append(\"/path/to/google-cloud-sdk/platform/google_appengine/lib\")'\n   ```\n\n   This init-hook will append the necessary path to the system path when pylint is run.\n\n3. **VS Code Settings**: In addition to the `.pylintrc` file, ensure that your VS Code settings are correctly configured. You can add settings in the `.vscode/settings.json` file:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"python.linting.pylintArgs\": [\n       \"--init-hook='import sys; sys.path.append(\\\"/path/to/google-cloud-sdk/platform/google_appengine/lib\\\")'\"\n     ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Virtual Environment**: If you are using a virtual environment, make sure that the virtual environment is activated when you run pylint. Sometimes the virtual environment can have a different PYTHONPATH.\n\n5. **Check Pylint Version**: Ensure you are using a version of pylint that is compatible with your Python version. Sometimes upgrading or downgrading pylint can solve such issues.\n\n6. **Alternative Linter**: If the issue persists and is affecting your productivity, consider using an alternative linter like `flake8` which might not have the same issue with your project's structure.\n\n7. **Debugging**: As a last resort, you can use debugging statements within your code to print out `sys.path` at runtime to ensure that your PYTHONPATH is being set correctly when the application is running and when pylint is being executed.\n\nBy ensuring that pylint is looking in the correct directories and is properly configured, you should be able to resolve this import error. If none of these solutions work, there might be a specific issue with the version of the Google App Engine SDK or its installation, in which case consulting the official documentation or support forums might provide more insights."
