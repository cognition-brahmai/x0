The code I'm referring to is as follows:\n\n```python\nx = 16\n\nsqrt = x**(.5)  #returns 4\nsqrt = x**(1/2) #returns 1\n```\nI'm aware I can import the math module and use the sqrt function, but I want to understand why the above code doesn't work as expected. I also know that this behavior is fixed in Python 3."

        "content": "In Python 2, the issue you're encountering is due to the way division works with integers. By default, Python 2 performs integer division when both operands are integers. This means that when you write `1/2`, Python 2 interprets it as integer division, which results in `0`, not `0.5`. As a result, `x**(1/2)` is equivalent to `x**0`, which is `1` for any non-zero `x`.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening:\n\n1. `x**(.5)`: Here, `0.5` is a floating-point number, so Python performs floating-point exponentiation, which gives the correct square root of `x`. \n\n2. `x**(1/2)`: Since both `1` and `2` are integers, Python 2 performs integer division, resulting in `0`. Consequently, `x**0` is `1`.\n\nTo work around this limitation in Python 2, you can explicitly convert one of the operands to a float to ensure floating-point division:\n\n```python\nsqrt = x**(1/2.0)  # Converts 2 to a float, resulting in 0.5\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the division operator from Python 3 in Python 2 by including the following import statement at the beginning of your script:\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import division\n```\n\nThis will change the behavior of the division operator `/` to perform true division (like Python 3) instead of integer division when both operands are integers.\n\nFor example, with the import:\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import division\n\nx = 16\nsqrt = x**(1/2)  # Now returns 4.0\n```\n\nIn Python 3, integer division is performed using the `//` operator, and the `/` operator always performs true division, returning a float even if both operands are integers. This change makes the behavior more intuitive and consistent with mathematical expectations."
