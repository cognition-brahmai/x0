        "content": "To measure and display the execution time of a function in Python, you can use the `time` module. Here's a simple way to achieve this by calculating the elapsed time in seconds and then converting it to minutes:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef fun():\n    # Example function\n    time.sleep(5)  # Simulates a delay of 5 seconds\n\ndef measure_execution_time():\n    start_time = time.time()  # Record the start time\n    fun()  # Call the function you want to measure\n    end_time = time.time()  # Record the end time\n    \n    elapsed_time = end_time - start_time  # Calculate the elapsed time in seconds\n    elapsed_minutes = elapsed_time / 60  # Convert to minutes\n\n    print(f\"Execution time: {elapsed_minutes:.2f} minutes\")\n\nmeasure_execution_time()\n```\n\nIn this example, the `time.sleep(5)` is used to simulate a delay of 5 seconds within the `fun()` function. When you run `measure_execution_time()`, it will print out the execution time of `fun()` in minutes. The `.2f` format specifier in the print function ensures that the output is displayed with two decimal places."
