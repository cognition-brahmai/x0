I want to be able to check if the file already exists in the destination folder, and if it does, rename it iteratively. For example, if 1234.pdf exists, it should be renamed to 1234_1.pdf, the next duplicate should be 1234_2.pdf, and so on. The code I have so far isn't working as expected. Can someone help me correct this?\n\n```python\nimport arcpy\nimport os\nimport re\nimport sys\nimport traceback\nimport collections\nimport shutil\n\nmovdir = r\"C:\\Scans\"\nbasedir = r\"C:\\Links\"\n\ntry:\n    #Walk through all files in the directory that contains the files to copy\n    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(movdir):\n        for filename in files:\n            #find the name location and name of files\n            path = os.path.join(root, filename)\n            print path\n            #file name and extension\n            ARN, extension = os.path.splitext(filename)\n            print ARN\n\n            #Location of the corresponding folder in the new directory\n            link = os.path.join(basedir,ARN)\n\n            # if the folder already exists in new directory\n            if os.path.exists(link):\n\n                #this is the file location in the new directory\n                file = os.path.join(basedir, ARN, ARN)\n                linkfn = os.path.join(basedir, ARN, filename)\n\n                if os.path.exists(linkfn):\n                    i = 0\n                    #if this file already exists in the folder\n                    print \"Path exists already\"\n                    while os.path.exists(file + \"_\" + str(i) + extension):\n                        i+=1\n                    print \"Already 2x exists...\"\n                    print \"Renaming\"\n                    shutil.copy(path, file + \"_\" + str(i) + extension)\n                else:\n\n                    shutil.copy(path, link)\n                    print ARN + \" \" +  \"Copied\"\n            else:\n                print ARN + \" \" + \"Not Found\"\n```"

        "content": "Your code seems to have the right idea, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed to achieve the desired functionality. Let's refine your script:\n\n1. Ensure that you're correctly constructing the destination file path with the right conditions.\n2. Make sure you're incrementing the file name correctly when duplicates exist.\n3. Ensure that the file is copied to the correct location.\n\nHere's a revised version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport shutil\n\nmovdir = r\"C:\\Scans\"\nbasedir = r\"C:\\Links\"\n\n# Walk through all files in the directory that contains the files to copy\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(movdir):\n    for filename in files:\n        # Find the name location and name of files\n        path = os.path.join(root, filename)\n        print(f\"Processing file: {path}\")\n        \n        # File name and extension\n        ARN, extension = os.path.splitext(filename)\n        \n        # Location of the corresponding folder in the new directory\n        link = os.path.join(basedir, ARN)\n\n        # If the folder already exists in new directory\n        if os.path.exists(link):\n            # This is the file location in the new directory\n            linkfn = os.path.join(link, filename)\n\n            # Check if this file already exists in the folder\n            if os.path.exists(linkfn):\n                i = 1\n                new_filename = f\"{ARN}_{i}{extension}\"\n                new_file_path = os.path.join(link, new_filename)\n                \n                # Increment the filename until a non-existing one is found\n                while os.path.exists(new_file_path):\n                    i += 1\n                    new_filename = f\"{ARN}_{i}{extension}\"\n                    new_file_path = os.path.join(link, new_filename)\n                \n                print(f\"Duplicate found. Renaming and copying to: {new_file_path}\")\n                shutil.copy(path, new_file_path)\n            else:\n                # If no duplicate, copy the file directly\n                shutil.copy(path, linkfn)\n                print(f\"Copied {filename} to {link}\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Directory for {ARN} not found in destination.\")\n```\n\n### Key Changes and Explanations:\n\n1. **Constructing Paths**: Ensure that `linkfn` is always constructed with the full destination path including the filename.\n\n2. **Incrementing File Names**: Start the counter `i` at 1 and keep incrementing until a unique filename is found.\n\n3. **Using f-strings**: For better readability and easier string manipulation, especially with filenames.\n\n4. **Direct Copy Path**: When no duplicates are found, directly copy the file to `linkfn`.\n\n5. **Print Statements**: Updated to be more informative about the file operations being performed.\n\nEnsure that the `basedir` already contains the required subdirectories (e.g., `ARN` directories) for this script to work correctly. If the directories do not exist, you'll need to create them programmatically or ensure they are in place beforehand."
