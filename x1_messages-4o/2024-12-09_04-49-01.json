I have a dictionary defined as:\n\n```python\nmydic = {}\nmydic['key_name'] = 'value_name'\n```\n\nI can check if the key exists using `mydic.has_key('key_name')`. However, I would like to print the name of the key 'key_name'. I don't want to list all the keys using `mydic.items()`, I just want to print one specific key. I am looking for something similar to this pseudo-code:\n\n```python\nprint \"the key name is\", mydic['key_name'].name_the_key(), \"and its value is\", mydic['key_name']\n```\n\nIs there a method like `name_the_key()` that can print a key name?\n\nI know that 'key_name' and `mydic['key_name']` are two different things and I was confused whether it would be correct to print 'key_name' out of the dictionary context."

        "content": "In Python, dictionary keys are not objects with methods like `name_the_key()`. Instead, keys are typically primitive data types such as strings or numbers. When you want to print a specific key and its corresponding value, you can do so directly by referencing the key in the dictionary. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n```python\nmydic = {}\nmydic['key_name'] = 'value_name'\n\n# Check if the key exists\nif 'key_name' in mydic:\n    # Print the key and its value\n    print(\"The key name is 'key_name' and its value is\", mydic['key_name'])\nelse:\n    print(\"The key does not exist in the dictionary.\")\n```\n\nIn this code, you directly use the key `'key_name'` to access its value in the dictionary and print both the key and the value. The key itself is a string, so you can directly print it by including it in your print statement. There is no built-in method like `name_the_key()` because keys are not objects with associated methods in a dictionary."
