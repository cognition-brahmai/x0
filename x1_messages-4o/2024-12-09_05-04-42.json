I have tried to use the `torch.no_grad()` context manager and set the model in eval mode using `linear.eval()`, but when I print the `requires_grad` attribute of the model's weights, it still returns `True`. What should I do to set the model in eval mode? Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    linear = nn.Linear(1, 1)\n    linear.eval()\n    print(linear.weight.requires_grad)\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is because the `torch.no_grad()` context manager only affects the computation of gradients during forward and backward passes, but it does not change the `requires_grad` attribute of the model's parameters. The `eval()` method also doesn't affect `requires_grad`; it only sets the model to evaluation mode, which changes the behavior of certain layers like dropout and batch normalization.\n\nTo set the `requires_grad` attribute of a model's parameters to `False`, you need to iterate over the parameters and set `requires_grad` for each one explicitly. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\n# Define the model\nlinear = nn.Linear(1, 1)\n\n# Set requires_grad to False for all parameters\nfor param in linear.parameters():\n    param.requires_grad = False\n\n# Print the requires_grad attribute to verify\nprint(linear.weight.requires_grad)  # Should print False\n```\n\nThis will ensure that the gradients are not tracked for the parameters of your model, effectively freezing them during training or evaluation."
