Each user should be able to see the list of movies and, if they have reviewed a movie, the score they gave. They do not care about scores provided by other users. I have two models, \"Topic\" for the movie and \"Record\" for the review. I want to perform a left outer join operation using Django ORM equivalent to the SQL query: `select * from bar_topic left join (select topic_id as tid, value from bar_record where user_id = 1) on tid = bar_topic.id`. However, I'm having trouble getting the correct results. The raw SQL query gives me the correct results, but the Django ORM query doesn't. How can I accurately perform this operation using Django ORM?"

        "content": "To perform a left outer join using Django ORM similar to the SQL query you've described, you can utilize Django's `annotate` and `Subquery` features. Here's how you can achieve the desired outcome:\n\nFirst, ensure your models are correctly defined. Here's a simple structure for your `Topic` and `Record` models:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User\n\nclass Topic(models.Model):\n    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)\n\nclass Record(models.Model):\n    topic = models.ForeignKey(Topic, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n    value = models.IntegerField()  # Assuming 'value' is the review score\n```\n\nNow, to perform the left outer join operation similar to your SQL query using Django ORM, you can do the following:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db.models import OuterRef, Subquery, IntegerField\nfrom django.db.models.functions import Coalesce\n\n# Assuming 'user_id' is the ID of the user whose reviews you want to fetch\nuser_id = 1\n\n# Subquery to get the value from Record for the specific user\nrecord_subquery = Record.objects.filter(\n    topic_id=OuterRef('pk'),\n    user_id=user_id\n).values('value')[:1]\n\n# Annotate the Topic query with the review value from the subquery\ntopics_with_reviews = Topic.objects.annotate(\n    review_value=Coalesce(Subquery(record_subquery, output_field=IntegerField()), None)\n)\n\n# Now when you iterate over topics_with_reviews, each Topic object will have an additional attribute 'review_value'\nfor topic in topics_with_reviews:\n    print(f\"Movie: {topic.title}, Your Review: {topic.review_value}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Subquery**: We use a subquery to fetch the `value` from the `Record` model for the specific user and topic. The `OuterRef('pk')` allows us to refer to the `Topic` model's primary key in the subquery.\n- **Coalesce**: This function is used to ensure that if there's no review by the user for a particular topic, the `review_value` will be `None` instead of causing an error.\n- **Annotate**: We annotate each `Topic` with the `review_value` extracted from the subquery.\n\nThis approach should mimic the behavior of your raw SQL query using Django's ORM and provide you with the correct results."
