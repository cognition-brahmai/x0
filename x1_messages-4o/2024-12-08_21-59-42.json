The collage should be designed with three equal-sized rectangular sections, each showcasing one of the photos in a unique and eye-catching way. The photos should be horizontally aligned with even spacing, maintaining a margin of 10 pixels between each photo. The width of each section should be set to 30% of the total width of the collage, while also ensuring that the height is set to auto to maintain the aspect ratio of the original images. Additionally, ensure that the background color of the collage is white, to enhance the overall aesthetic appeal. How can you effectively utilize HTML and CSS to create a visually stunning and user-friendly collage that meets these requirements?"

        "content": "Creating a dynamic collage using HTML and CSS involves structuring your HTML to hold the images and styling them appropriately with CSS to achieve the desired layout and appearance. Below is an example of how you can create a visually appealing and user-friendly collage with the specified requirements:\n\n### HTML\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Dynamic Photo Collage</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div class=\"collage\">\n        <div class=\"photo-container\">\n            <img src=\"photo1.jpg\" alt=\"Photo 1\">\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"photo-container\">\n            <img src=\"photo2.jpg\" alt=\"Photo 2\">\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"photo-container\">\n            <img src=\"photo3.jpg\" alt=\"Photo 3\">\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### CSS (styles.css)\n\n```css\nbody {\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 0;\n    display: flex;\n    justify-content: center;\n    align-items: center;\n    height: 100vh;\n    background-color: #f0f0f0;\n}\n\n.collage {\n    display: flex;\n    justify-content: space-between;\n    align-items: center;\n    background-color: white;\n    padding: 10px;\n    border: 1px solid #ddd;\n    box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\n    width: 90%;\n    max-width: 1200px;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n}\n\n.photo-container {\n    width: 30%;\n    margin: 0 10px;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    transition: transform 0.3s ease;\n}\n\n.photo-container img {\n    width: 100%;\n    height: auto;\n    display: block;\n    border: 1px solid #ccc;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease;\n}\n\n.photo-container:hover {\n    transform: scale(1.05);\n}\n\n.photo-container:hover img {\n    box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **HTML Structure**: The HTML contains a main collage container (`div.collage`) and three photo containers (`div.photo-container`) each holding an image. This structure allows for the use of CSS Flexbox to align the images horizontally.\n\n- **CSS Styling**:\n  - The `body` uses Flexbox to center the collage both vertically and horizontally on the page.\n  - The `.collage` class uses Flexbox to space the images evenly with `justify-content: space-between`.\n  - Each `.photo-container` has a fixed width of 30% to ensure three equal sections.\n  - A margin of 10 pixels is maintained between each photo container to provide spacing.\n  - The `img` tag is styled to maintain its aspect ratio with `width: 100%` and `height: auto`.\n  - A subtle hover effect is added to each photo container and image to create an interactive and visually appealing experience.\n\nThis setup will create a stylish and responsive collage layout that meets all specified requirements. Adjust the `max-width` and other styles as needed to fit your specific design needs."
