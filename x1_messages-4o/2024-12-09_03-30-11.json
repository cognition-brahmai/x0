        "content": "To handle exceptions in asynchronous code using `asyncio` and `aiohttp`, you need to ensure that any exceptions raised within coroutines are caught and processed appropriately. The error message \"Future/Task exception was never retrieved\" indicates that an exception was raised in a coroutine, but it wasn't caught or handled properly.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can handle exceptions in your code:\n\n1. **Use `async` and `await` syntax**: This syntax is more modern and intuitive. It also allows you to use try-except blocks directly within coroutines.\n\n2. **Handle exceptions within the coroutine**: Use try-except blocks inside the coroutine to catch exceptions.\n\n3. **Properly close the response**: Ensure that you close the response object to avoid any resource leaks.\n\nHere's an updated version of your code with these modifications:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport asyncio\nimport aiohttp\n\nasync def get(url):\n    try:\n        print('GET %s' % url)\n        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n            async with session.get(url) as resp:\n                if resp.status >= 400:\n                    raise Exception(\"%s has error '%s: %s'\" % (url, resp.status, resp.reason))\n                return await resp.text()\n    except Exception as e:\n        raise Exception(\"%s has error '%s'\" % (url, e))\n\nasync def fill_data(run):\n    url = 'http://www.google.com/%s' % run['name']\n    try:\n        run['data'] = await get(url)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"Error fetching data for %s: %s\" % (run['name'], e))\n        run['data'] = None  # Or handle it in another appropriate way\n\ndef get_runs():\n    runs = [{'name': 'one'}, {'name': 'two'}]\n    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n    tasks = [fill_data(r) for r in runs]\n    loop.run_until_complete(asyncio.gather(*tasks))\n    return runs\n\ntry:\n    runs = get_runs()\n    print(runs)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(repr(e))\n    sys.exit(1)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- **Use of `async` and `await`**: This makes the code more readable and modern.\n- **`aiohttp.ClientSession`**: Use `async with` to create a session and ensure it is properly closed.\n- **Error Handling**: Catch exceptions in `fill_data()` to prevent unhandled exceptions from causing the program to crash. You can log the error or handle it as needed.\n- **Use `asyncio.gather`**: This helps to collect results from multiple coroutines and manage exceptions more gracefully.\n\nThis setup should help you catch and handle exceptions more effectively in your asynchronous HTTP request handling with `asyncio` and `aiohttp`."
