        "content": "Yes, you can reduce fractions in Python using the `fractions` module, which is part of the standard library, or you can use the `sympy` library for more advanced mathematical operations. Additionally, NumPy doesn\u2019t provide direct functionality to reduce fractions, but the libraries mentioned above can be used alongside NumPy for this purpose.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can use the `fractions` module to reduce fractions:\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Compute 98/42 as a reduced fraction\nfraction = Fraction(98, 42)\nprint(fraction)  # Output: 7/3\n```\n\nAlternatively, using the `sympy` library:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Compute 98/42 as a reduced fraction\nfraction = Rational(98, 42)\nprint(fraction)  # Output: 7/3\n```\n\nBoth methods will give you the reduced form of the fraction, `7/3`, instead of the decimal representation. If you don\u2019t have `sympy` installed, you can add it using pip:\n\n```sh\npip install sympy\n```\n\nThese methods will help you work with fractions and keep them in their reduced form."
