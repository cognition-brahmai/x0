Post that, I modified the list and now I want to restore the tuples to use my data. What is the inverse function of zip() in Python that helps me achieve this?"

        "content": "In Python, if you have used the `zip()` function to combine multiple iterables into tuples, you can use the unpacking operator `*` to achieve the inverse operation, which is often referred to as \"unzipping\" the data back into separate lists or tuples. Here's how you can do it:\n\nSuppose you have a list of tuples:\n\n```python\ncombined = [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]\n```\n\nTo unzip this into separate lists, you can use the following approach:\n\n```python\n# Unzipping the list of tuples\nnumbers, letters = zip(*combined)\n\n# Converting to list if needed\nnumbers = list(numbers)\nletters = list(letters)\n\nprint(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\nprint(letters)  # Output: ['a', 'b', 'c']\n```\n\nThe `*` operator is used to unpack the list of tuples into separate arguments for the `zip()` function, effectively reversing the original zipping operation. This will give you back the original sequences that were zipped together."
