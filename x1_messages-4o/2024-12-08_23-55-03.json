Here is the puzzle:\nI have a string \"udpogojvlsibvv\" that seems random, but there is a pattern to it. Each letter in the decoded string is the letter that comes before it in the alphabet. Can you help me decode the string and use your implementation to capitalize the first letter of each word?\nPlease provide the C++ code that can solve this challenge."

        "content": "Certainly! Let's tackle this challenge step by step. \n\nFirst, we'll decode the given string \"udpogojvlsibvv\" by replacing each letter with the one that comes before it in the alphabet. Then, we'll write a C++ program that capitalizes the first letter of each word in the decoded string.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in C++:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n#include <cctype>\n\n// Function to decode the given string\nstd::string decodeString(const std::string &encoded) {\n    std::string decoded;\n    for (char c : encoded) {\n        decoded += (c - 1); // Move each character to the one before it in the alphabet\n    }\n    return decoded;\n}\n\n// Function to capitalize the first letter of each word\nstd::string capitalizeWords(const std::string &str) {\n    std::string capitalized = str;\n    bool isNewWord = true;\n\n    for (size_t i = 0; i < capitalized.length(); ++i) {\n        if (std::isspace(capitalized[i])) {\n            isNewWord = true;\n        } else if (isNewWord) {\n            capitalized[i] = std::toupper(capitalized[i]);\n            isNewWord = false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return capitalized;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::string encodedString = \"udpogojvlsibvv\";\n    std::string decodedString = decodeString(encodedString);\n    std::cout << \"Decoded String: \" << decodedString << std::endl;\n\n    std::string capitalizedString = capitalizeWords(decodedString);\n    std::cout << \"Capitalized String: \" << capitalizedString << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Decoding the String**:  \n   - The `decodeString` function iterates over each character of the encoded string and shifts it by one position backward in the ASCII table using `c - 1`.\n\n2. **Capitalizing Words**:  \n   - The `capitalizeWords` function iterates through the decoded string. It checks for spaces to determine the start of a new word. If it finds a new word, it capitalizes the first letter using `std::toupper`.\n\n3. **Main Function**:  \n   - It initializes the encoded string, decodes it, prints the decoded string, then capitalizes the words and prints the result.\n\nWhen you run this program, it will decode the string \"udpogojvlsibvv\" to \"tconfinrkrhaau\", and then capitalize the first letter of the resulting words, if applicable."
