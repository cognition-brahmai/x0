Here is my model:\n\n```python\nclass SampleModel(models.Model):\n    apple = models.CharField(max_length=30)\n    orange = models.CharField(max_length=30)\n\n    class Meta:\n        managed = False\n```\n\nWhen I run a unit test that creates a `SampleModel`, I encounter this error: `DatabaseError: no such table: SAMPLE_SAMPLE_MODEL`. According to the Django documentation, for models with `managed=False`, I must ensure that the correct tables are created as part of the test setup. How can I create these tables during the test setup? Alternatively, is there a way to make the model have `managed = True` only during the test? In the actual application, this model is backed by a database view. However, during testing, I want to treat this as a table and be able to insert test data."

        "content": "To handle a Django model with `managed = False` during tests, you have a couple of options. Since the database view isn't available in the test environment, you'll need to create the corresponding table manually as part of your test setup. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Option 1: Create Tables in Test Setup\n\n1. **Create the Table Manually in Test Setup**: You can write SQL to create the table within your test setup method. This is typically done using Django's database connection.\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.db import connection\n\nclass SampleModelTestCase(TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n            cursor.execute('''\n                CREATE TABLE sample_samplemodel (\n                    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n                    apple VARCHAR(30),\n                    orange VARCHAR(30)\n                )\n            ''')\n\n    def tearDown(self):\n        with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n            cursor.execute('DROP TABLE sample_samplemodel')\n\n    def test_sample_model(self):\n        # Your test logic here\n        pass\n```\n\n2. **Use the `tearDown` method** to remove the table after tests, ensuring a clean state for other tests.\n\n### Option 2: Temporarily Set `managed = True`\n\nIf you want to temporarily override `managed = False` during tests, you can dynamically modify the model's `Meta` class. However, this is a bit hacky and not officially recommended:\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom myapp.models import SampleModel\n\nclass SampleModelTestCase(TestCase):\n    @classmethod\n    def setUpClass(cls):\n        super().setUpClass()\n        # Temporarily set managed to True\n        SampleModel._meta.managed = True\n        # Create table\n        with connection.schema_editor() as schema_editor:\n            schema_editor.create_model(SampleModel)\n\n    @classmethod\n    def tearDownClass(cls):\n        # Drop table\n        with connection.schema_editor() as schema_editor:\n            schema_editor.delete_model(SampleModel)\n        # Reset managed to False\n        SampleModel._meta.managed = False\n        super().tearDownClass()\n\n    def test_sample_model(self):\n        # Your test logic here\n        pass\n```\n\n### Choose the Approach Based on Your Needs\n\n- **Direct SQL**: If you prefer direct control or your table schema is simple, use the SQL approach.\n- **Temporary Managed Change**: If you want Django to handle schema creation, dynamically change `managed` during tests.\n\nBoth approaches ensure your tests can interact with the `SampleModel` as if it were a regular table, without impacting your production settings where it is backed by a view."
