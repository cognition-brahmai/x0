        "content": "Certainly! Let's go through each of these statistical measures one by one:\n\n### Mean\nThe mean, often referred to as the average, is calculated by adding up all the numbers in a data set and then dividing by the number of values in that set.\n\n**Steps to calculate the mean:**\n1. Add all the numbers in your data set.\n2. Divide the sum by the number of values in the data set.\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Mean} = \\frac{\\sum \\text{(all values)}}{\\text{Number of values}} \\]\n\n**Example:**\nFor the data set: 5, 7, 3, 9\n- Sum of values = 5 + 7 + 3 + 9 = 24\n- Number of values = 4\n- Mean = 24 / 4 = 6\n\n### Median\nThe median is the middle value in a data set when the numbers are arranged in order. If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n\n**Steps to calculate the median:**\n1. Arrange the numbers in ascending order.\n2. If the number of values is odd, the median is the middle number.\n3. If the number of values is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n\n**Example:**\nFor the data set: 5, 7, 3, 9\n- Arrange in order: 3, 5, 7, 9\n- Since there are 4 numbers (even), take the average of the two middle numbers: (5 + 7) / 2 = 6\n\n### Mode\nThe mode is the number that appears most frequently in a data set. A data set may have one mode, more than one mode, or no mode at all.\n\n**Steps to calculate the mode:**\n1. Count the frequency of each number in the data set.\n2. Identify the number(s) that appear most frequently.\n\n**Example:**\nFor the data set: 5, 7, 3, 9, 7\n- The number 7 appears twice, while all other numbers appear once.\n- Mode = 7\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need clarification."
