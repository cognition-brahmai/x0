These keys used to access the previous commands in the history, but now they display control characters instead. For example, the up arrow key displays \"^[[A\". I am using zsh, iTerm2 (3.0.9), and pyenv (1.0.2) with pyenv global set to 3.5.2. I tried installing readline as suggested in a previous solution but it didn't solve the problem. I don't have the PYTHONSTARTUP variable but I didn't use it before and I am unsure how it interacts with pyenv. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with the arrow keys in the Python shell is likely related to how the readline library is being interfaced with your Python environment. The readline library is responsible for handling line-editing features like navigating through command history. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure GNU Readline is Installed**: Make sure that the GNU Readline library is installed on your system. You can install it using Homebrew:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew install readline\n   ```\n\n2. **Reinstall Python with Readline Support**: Sometimes, Python needs to be recompiled with the correct readline support. You can do this using `pyenv`:\n\n   ```bash\n   env PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS=\"--with-readline\" pyenv install 3.5.2\n   ```\n\n   Make sure to set the newly installed version as the global or local version again:\n\n   ```bash\n   pyenv global 3.5.2\n   ```\n\n3. **Check `pip` Installation**: Make sure that the `gnureadline` package is installed for your Python version. You can install it using:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install gnureadline\n   ```\n\n   This package provides GNU Readline support for Python on macOS.\n\n4. **Configure `PYTHONSTARTUP`**: While you mentioned you haven't used `PYTHONSTARTUP`, you can create a simple `pythonrc.py` file to ensure readline is correctly initialized. Create a file named `.pythonrc` in your home directory with the following content:\n\n   ```python\n   import readline\n   import rlcompleter\n   readline.parse_and_bind('tab: complete')\n   ```\n\n   Then, in your shell configuration file (e.g., `.zshrc`), add:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PYTHONSTARTUP=~/.pythonrc\n   ```\n\n   Reload your shell configuration with `source ~/.zshrc`.\n\n5. **Verify Terminal Preferences**: Check your iTerm2 settings to ensure that your keyboard shortcuts are not interfering with the default behavior. Go to iTerm2 Preferences > Profiles > Keys and ensure that the arrow keys are set to \"Normal\".\n\n6. **Fallback to System Python**: If the issue persists, try using the system Python to check if the problem is specific to the `pyenv` environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   /usr/bin/python\n   ```\n\nIf these steps don't solve the issue, you may want to report it to the maintainers of pyenv or check if there are any known issues with the specific Python version or pyenv version you're using."
