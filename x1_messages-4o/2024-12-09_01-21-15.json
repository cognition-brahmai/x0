        "content": "To install BeautifulSoup for Python 3.5 when you have both Python 2.7 and Python 3.5 installed, you should use `pip3`, which is the version of pip associated with Python 3. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Check Python 3 Installation**: First, make sure Python 3.5 is properly installed and accessible. You can check this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 --version\n   ```\n\n   This should return the version of Python 3.5 that is installed.\n\n2. **Use pip3 to Install BeautifulSoup**: To specifically install packages for Python 3, use `pip3`. Run the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip3 install beautifulsoup4\n   ```\n\n   This command will install BeautifulSoup for your Python 3.5 environment.\n\n3. **Verify the Installation**: After installation, you can verify that BeautifulSoup is installed for Python 3 by opening a Python 3 shell and trying to import it:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3\n   ```\n\n   Then, in the Python shell, run:\n\n   ```python\n   from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n   ```\n\n   If there are no errors, then BeautifulSoup is correctly installed for Python 3.5.\n\n4. **Alternative Method**: If `pip3` is not found, you might need to specify the full path to the Python 3 version of pip. You can often find it in the `scripts` or `bin` directory of your Python 3 installation. For example:\n\n   ```bash\n   /path/to/python3.5/bin/pip install beautifulsoup4\n   ```\n\n   Replace `/path/to/python3.5` with the actual path to your Python 3.5 installation.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to install BeautifulSoup specifically for Python 3.5 on your system."
