Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n```python\na = []\na.append((1, 2, 4))\na.append((2, 3, 4))\n\n# Using list comprehension to flatten the list of tuples\nb = [item for tup in a for item in tup]\n\nprint(b)\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n\n```\n[1, 2, 4, 2, 3, 4]\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The list comprehension `[item for tup in a for item in tup]` iterates over each tuple in the list `a` and then iterates over each item in the tuple, effectively flattening the list of tuples into a single list."
