And can you provide a Swift code to arrange the chords A, G, C, and E in ascending order based on their frequency using this formula?"

        "content": "To implement the Swift function to calculate the frequency of a chord using the formula \\( f = 2^{(n/12)} \\times 440 \\), where \\( f \\) is the frequency in Hz and \\( n \\) is the number of half-steps away from A4 (440 Hz), you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a dictionary to map each chord to the number of half-steps from A4.\n2. Implement a function to calculate the frequency based on the number of half-steps.\n3. Use this function to calculate the frequency of each chord.\n4. Sort the chords based on their frequencies.\n\nHere's a Swift code example to achieve this:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\n// Dictionary to map each chord to the number of half-steps from A4\nlet chordHalfSteps: [String: Int] = [\n    \"A\": 0,    // A4\n    \"G\": -2,   // G4 is 2 half-steps below A4\n    \"C\": -9,   // C4 is 9 half-steps below A4\n    \"E\": -5    // E4 is 5 half-steps below A4\n]\n\n// Function to calculate the frequency of a chord\nfunc calculateFrequency(halfSteps: Int) -> Double {\n    return pow(2.0, Double(halfSteps) / 12.0) * 440.0\n}\n\n// Calculate frequencies for each chord\nvar chordFrequencies: [(chord: String, frequency: Double)] = []\n\nfor (chord, halfSteps) in chordHalfSteps {\n    let frequency = calculateFrequency(halfSteps: halfSteps)\n    chordFrequencies.append((chord: chord, frequency: frequency))\n}\n\n// Sort the chords by frequency in ascending order\nlet sortedChords = chordFrequencies.sorted { $0.frequency < $1.frequency }\n\n// Print the chords in ascending order of frequency\nfor (chord, frequency) in sortedChords {\n    print(\"\\(chord): \\(frequency) Hz\")\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We define a dictionary `chordHalfSteps` that maps each chord to its corresponding half-step difference from A4.\n- The `calculateFrequency` function uses the formula to compute the frequency.\n- We loop through each chord, calculate its frequency, and store it in an array `chordFrequencies`.\n- We sort the array `chordFrequencies` based on frequency values in ascending order.\n- Finally, we print out the chords sorted by frequency.\n\nThis code will output the chords A, G, C, and E in ascending order based on their frequency."
