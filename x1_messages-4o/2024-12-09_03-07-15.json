However, I'm receiving a warning that says: \"FutureWarning: using a dict with renaming is deprecated and will be removed in a future version\". How can I modify my code to avoid this warning? Here is my current code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\"User\": [\"user1\", \"user2\", \"user2\", \"user3\", \"user2\", \"user1\"],\n                  \"Amount\": [10.0, 5.0, 8.0, 10.5, 7.5, 8.0]})\n\ndf.groupby([\"User\"]).agg({\"Amount\": {\"Sum\": \"sum\", \"Count\": \"count\"}})\n```\n\nThis generates the warning:\n\n```python\nFutureWarning: using a dict with renaming is deprecated and will be removed in a future version\nreturn super(DataFrameGroupBy, self).aggregate(arg, *args, **kwargs)\n```"

        "content": "To address the warning and update your code to be compatible with the future versions of Pandas, you should use the new syntax for renaming the result columns after an aggregation operation. Instead of using a nested dictionary for renaming, you can use a list of tuples where each tuple consists of the new column name and the aggregation function.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\"User\": [\"user1\", \"user2\", \"user2\", \"user3\", \"user2\", \"user1\"],\n                   \"Amount\": [10.0, 5.0, 8.0, 10.5, 7.5, 8.0]})\n\n# Use a list of tuples for aggregation and renaming\nagg_operations = [\n    (\"Sum\", \"sum\"),\n    (\"Count\", \"count\")\n]\n\n# Apply the aggregation with the new syntax\nresult = df.groupby(\"User\").agg(**{\"Amount_\" + name: (\"Amount\", func) for name, func in agg_operations})\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nIn this updated code, I'm using a dictionary comprehension to dynamically create the aggregation dictionary with new column names. The `Amount_` prefix is added to the new column names to indicate that they are derived from the `Amount` column. You can adjust the prefix or naming convention as per your requirements. This approach will eliminate the warning and keep your code future-proof."
