I am unable to upgrade Pip and all my Pip commands end with a SyntaxError. I am using CentOS 7 and Ansible and cannot upgrade to CentOS 8 at this point. I would like to upgrade to the most recent version of Pip that still works and I believe that is Pip 20. How can I prevent an upgrade to Pip 21 and fix my Python Pip installation?"

        "content": "To resolve your issue with Pip on your CentOS 7 Vagrant VM, you can manually install a specific version of Pip that is compatible with your environment. Since you want to use Pip 20, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Ensure Python and Pip are Installed:**\n\n   First, make sure that Python and Pip are installed on your system. You can do this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   pip --version\n   ```\n\n   If they are not installed, you can install Python using:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo yum install python\n   ```\n\n2. **Download Pip Version 20:**\n\n   You can manually download and install Pip 20.3.4 (the last release in the Pip 20 series) by using the following commands:\n\n   ```bash\n   curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/2.7/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py\n   python get-pip.py pip==20.3.4\n   ```\n\n   Note: This script is specifically for Python 2.7 environments.\n\n3. **Prevent Automatic Upgrades:**\n\n   To prevent Pip from automatically upgrading to a newer version, you can create a configuration file that specifies the version to use. Create or edit the `pip.conf` file in your home directory:\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p ~/.pip\n   nano ~/.pip/pip.conf\n   ```\n\n   Add the following content to `pip.conf`:\n\n   ```ini\n   [global]\n   disable-pip-version-check = true\n   ```\n\n   This will prevent Pip from checking for a newer version.\n\n4. **Test Your Pip Installation:**\n\n   After installation, confirm that the correct version of Pip is installed:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip --version\n   ```\n\n   It should output something like:\n\n   ```\n   pip 20.3.4 from /path/to/site-packages (python 2.7)\n   ```\n\n5. **Troubleshoot SyntaxError:**\n\n   If you are encountering a `SyntaxError`, it could be due to compatibility issues between the Python version and Pip. Ensure that you are using a version of Python that is supported by the version of Pip you are installing. Since CentOS 7 often comes with Python 2.7 by default, make sure your scripts and Pip processes are compatible with Python 2.7.\n\nFollowing these steps should help you manage your Pip installation effectively on CentOS 7 with Vagrant. If you encounter further issues, please provide more specific error messages for additional assistance."
