The `zip` function pairs elements from two lists based on their positions, which does not create all possible combinations.\n\nHere's how you can use `itertools.product` to get the desired output:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\na = [1, 2]\nb = [4, 5]\n\ncombinations = list(product(a, b))\nprint(combinations)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```python\n[(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5)]\n```\n\nThe `itertools.product` function computes the Cartesian product of the input iterables, which is exactly what you need to get all possible pair combinations from the two lists."
