I was able to resolve this by switching from Qt4Agg to TkAgg, which preserved the drawing elements even if the figures were closed. I would like to enhance my understanding by learning how to configure the Qt4agg backend to behave the same way."

        "content": "To configure the Qt4Agg backend in Matplotlib and address the issue where the `show()` function deletes drawing elements, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install Necessary Libraries**: Ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed. You need PyQt4 or PySide for Qt4Agg backend. You can install them using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install PyQt4\n   ```\n\n   or\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install PySide\n   ```\n\n2. **Configure Matplotlib to Use Qt4Agg**: You can configure the backend in your script or in the Matplotlib configuration file.\n\n   - **In Your Script**: Before importing `matplotlib.pyplot`, set the backend:\n\n     ```python\n     import matplotlib\n     matplotlib.use('Qt4Agg')\n     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n     ```\n\n   - **In the Matplotlib Configuration File**: Locate your Matplotlib configuration file `matplotlibrc`. You can find the location by running:\n\n     ```python\n     import matplotlib\n     print(matplotlib.matplotlib_fname())\n     ```\n\n     Open this file and set the backend:\n\n     ```\n     backend : Qt4Agg\n     ```\n\n3. **Prevent `show()` from Blocking**: When using the `show()` function, it may block the script execution, leading to the deletion of drawing elements upon closing the figure window. To avoid this, you can:\n\n   - Use the `plt.show(block=False)` function, which allows the script to continue running even after the figure window is opened.\n   \n   - Alternatively, you can use `plt.ion()` to enable interactive mode, which automatically updates the figures without blocking.\n\n     ```python\n     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n     plt.ion()\n     ```\n\n4. **Preserve Drawing Elements**: If you want to keep the drawing elements even after closing the figure window, you can save the figure before closing it:\n\n   ```python\n   fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n   ax.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])\n   plt.savefig('my_figure.png')  # Save the figure\n   plt.show(block=False)\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you can configure the Qt4Agg backend and manage the behavior of the `show()` function to preserve your drawing elements, similar to how TkAgg functions."
