I have downloaded the Python extension for Code, which promises intellisense, but it's not working for packages other than the core Python packages like \"math\". I have tried setting up the extra environment variable as described in the link, but it didn't work. I even recreated an Anaconda environment, but the problem persists. I also have another issue regarding lack of auto-indentation for Python in VS Code. How can I resolve these issues?"

        "content": "To enable IntelliSense for Python in Visual Studio Code when using Anaconda3, you can follow these steps to ensure that everything is set up correctly:\n\n### Step 1: Install the Necessary Extensions\n1. **Python Extension**: Make sure you have the official Python extension installed in VS Code. This extension is essential for IntelliSense and other Python-related functionalities.\n2. **Pylance Extension**: Install the Pylance extension for enhanced IntelliSense support. Pylance is a language server for Python that provides fast and feature-rich IntelliSense.\n\n### Step 2: Configure the Python Interpreter\n1. **Open Command Palette**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS) to open the Command Palette.\n2. **Select Interpreter**: Type `Python: Select Interpreter` and choose the interpreter from your Anaconda environment. Ensure that the path points to your Anaconda environment's Python executable.\n\n### Step 3: Update Anaconda Environment\n1. **Activate Environment**: Open a terminal and activate your Anaconda environment using:\n   ```bash\n   conda activate your_environment_name\n   ```\n2. **Install Packages**: Ensure that all the necessary packages are installed in your environment. You can install a package using:\n   ```bash\n   conda install package_name\n   ```\n\n### Step 4: Update VS Code Settings\n- **Ensure JSON Settings**: Make sure your settings.json (found under `.vscode` directory) includes the Python interpreter path:\n  ```json\n  \"python.pythonPath\": \"path_to_your_conda_environment_python\",\n  ```\n\n### Step 5: Auto-indentation and Formatting\n1. **Auto-indentation Settings**: VS Code usually handles indentation automatically. However, ensure these settings are configured:\n   - Go to `File -> Preferences -> Settings` (or `Code -> Preferences -> Settings` on macOS).\n   - Search for `editor.formatOnType` and ensure it's enabled.\n   - Search for `editor.autoIndent` and set it to `full`.\n\n2. **Python Formatting**: You can use a formatter like `autopep8`, `black`, or `yapf` to automatically format your code. Install one of these formatters in your environment and configure it in your settings.json:\n   ```json\n   \"python.formatting.provider\": \"autopep8\",\n   ```\n\n### Step 6: Reload VS Code\n- After making these changes, restart VS Code to ensure that all settings are correctly applied.\n\nIf you still face issues, consider checking the Python output panel for errors by going to `View -> Output`, then selecting \"Python\" from the dropdown. This might give additional insights into what might be going wrong.\n\nBy following these steps, IntelliSense should work for your Anaconda environment in Visual Studio Code, and auto-indentation issues should be resolved."
