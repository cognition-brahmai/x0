The password must be at least 10 characters long, and should include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, along with symbols. In addition, the password should not include any commonly used phrases or words that can be easily guessed by cyber criminals. Can you provide guidance on how to select a random combination of letters, symbols, and numbers that would be difficult to crack? Additionally, could you recommend any password management tools to ensure that the user's passwords remain secure and easily accessible? \n#The Given Prompt#: \nCreate a table that shows the monthly sales revenue of a company for the past year.\n#Rewritten Prompt#: \nDesign a comprehensive report that presents the monthly sales performance of the company for the previous year, taking into account various parameters such as the location, product type, and target audience. The report should include a detailed analysis of the sales trends, identifying the best and worst performing months, and highlighting the reasons for the same. Additionally, the report should showcase any significant fluctuations in the sales figures, and recommend any necessary changes to improve the sales performance in the upcoming year. Could you provide some insights on how to use data visualization tools to make the report more compelling and easy to comprehend for the stakeholders? \n#The Given Prompt#:\nWrite a code that checks whether a given number is a prime number.\n#Rewritten Prompt#:\nDevelop a complex algorithm that checks whether a given number is a prime number or not, by considering various factors such as the divisibility rules, prime factorization, and number theory concepts. The algorithm should also be able to handle large numbers without crashing, and should provide accurate results within a reasonable amount of time. Furthermore, the code should include provisions to handle any exceptions or errors that may occur during the computation process. Can you suggest any advanced mathematical concepts or theories that could be utilized to optimize the efficiency and accuracy of the code?"

        "content": "### Secure Password Generation\n\nTo create a highly secure password, follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Length and Complexity**:\n   - Ensure the password is at least 10 characters long.\n   - Include a mix of uppercase letters (A-Z), lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), and symbols (!, @, #, $, etc.).\n\n2. **Randomization**:\n   - Avoid using common words or phrases.\n   - Use a password generator or create a random combination manually, such as: `G7$x9@P1fQ`.\n\n3. **Password Management Tools**:\n   - Consider using password managers like LastPass, 1Password, or Bitwarden to securely store and manage passwords.\n\n### Data Visualization for Sales Report\n\nTo create a compelling sales report:\n\n1. **Data Analysis**:\n   - Analyze sales by location, product type, and target audience.\n   - Identify best and worst performing months and reasons behind trends.\n\n2. **Visualizations**:\n   - Use tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Google Data Studio.\n   - Create charts such as line graphs for trends, bar charts for comparisons, and pie charts for market share.\n\n3. **Insights and Recommendations**:\n   - Highlight significant fluctuations and suggest strategic changes.\n   - Use visuals to make insights clear and impactful for stakeholders.\n\n### Prime Number Algorithm\n\nFor an efficient prime-checking algorithm:\n\n1. **Basic Check**:\n   - A number is prime if it's greater than 1 and not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.\n\n2. **Optimizations**:\n   - Check divisibility up to the square root of the number.\n   - Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes for pre-computation in case of multiple queries.\n\n3. **Handling Large Numbers**:\n   - Use modular arithmetic and efficient algorithms like Miller-Rabin for probabilistic checks.\n   - Implement exception handling to manage computational errors.\n\n4. **Advanced Concepts**:\n   - Explore number theory concepts such as Fermat's Little Theorem.\n   - Consider using BigInteger libraries in languages like Java or Python for handling large integers.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can ensure secure password creation, effective data visualization, and efficient prime number computation."
