When I use `os.remove`, it also deletes the actual contents of the original folder. On the other hand, when I try to use `os.shutil`, it throws an error. Is there a way to remove a symbolic link using Python commands without destroying the original content?"

        "content": "To delete a symbolic link without affecting the original contents it points to, you should use `os.unlink()` or `os.remove()` in Python, as these functions are meant to remove a file or symbolic link. The confusion might arise if there are permissions issues or if the symbolic link is not correctly identified. Here's a straightforward way to delete a symbolic link:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Path to the symbolic link\nlink_path = 'path/to/symlink'\n\n# Remove the symbolic link\ntry:\n    os.unlink(link_path)\n    print(f\"Symbolic link '{link_path}' has been removed successfully.\")\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(f\"Symbolic link '{link_path}' does not exist.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n```\n\nMake sure that `link_path` is indeed a symbolic link and that you have the necessary permissions to remove it. The `os.unlink()` function is specifically designed to remove files or symbolic links without affecting the target of the link. If you continue to face issues, you can check if `link_path` is a symbolic link using `os.path.islink(link_path)` before attempting to remove it."
