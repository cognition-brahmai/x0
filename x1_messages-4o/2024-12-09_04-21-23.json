The code looks as follows:\n\n```python\ntask1()\ntask2()\ntask3()\ndependent1()\n\ntask4()\ntask5()\ntask6()\ndependent2()\n\ndependent3()\n```\n\nThe dependencies are such that dependent1 needs to wait for tasks1-3 to complete, dependent2 needs to wait for tasks 4-6, and dependent3 needs to wait for dependents1-2. I would like to run as many tasks as possible in parallel. For instance, I want to run the whole 6 tasks first in parallel, then the first two dependents in parallel, and then the final dependent. I've been looking into various modules, but I'm trying to avoid using external libraries. I'm also unsure how the Queue-Thread technique could solve my problem. Could someone provide a solution or recommend a good resource?"

        "content": "To execute tasks in parallel in Python 2.7, you can use the `threading` module, which is part of the standard library. This allows you to execute multiple threads simultaneously. However, do note that due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), threading might not achieve true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks, but it works well for I/O-bound tasks. For CPU-bound tasks, you might consider using the `multiprocessing` module, but since you want to avoid external libraries, I'll focus on `threading`.\n\nHere's how you can organize your tasks with dependencies using `threading`:\n\n```python\nimport threading\n\n# Define your task functions\ndef task1():\n    print(\"Task 1 completed\")\n\ndef task2():\n    print(\"Task 2 completed\")\n\ndef task3():\n    print(\"Task 3 completed\")\n\ndef dependent1():\n    print(\"Dependent 1 completed\")\n\ndef task4():\n    print(\"Task 4 completed\")\n\ndef task5():\n    print(\"Task 5 completed\")\n\ndef task6():\n    print(\"Task 6 completed\")\n\ndef dependent2():\n    print(\"Dependent 2 completed\")\n\ndef dependent3():\n    print(\"Dependent 3 completed\")\n\n# Create wrapper functions to manage dependencies\ndef run_tasks_1_to_3():\n    t1 = threading.Thread(target=task1)\n    t2 = threading.Thread(target=task2)\n    t3 = threading.Thread(target=task3)\n\n    t1.start()\n    t2.start()\n    t3.start()\n\n    t1.join()\n    t2.join()\n    t3.join()\n\n    dependent1()\n\ndef run_tasks_4_to_6():\n    t4 = threading.Thread(target=task4)\n    t5 = threading.Thread(target=task5)\n    t6 = threading.Thread(target=task6)\n\n    t4.start()\n    t5.start()\n    t6.start()\n\n    t4.join()\n    t5.join()\n    t6.join()\n\n    dependent2()\n\ndef run_dependent_3():\n    dependent3()\n\n# Main method to orchestrate task execution\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    t_group_1 = threading.Thread(target=run_tasks_1_to_3)\n    t_group_2 = threading.Thread(target=run_tasks_4_to_6)\n\n    t_group_1.start()\n    t_group_2.start()\n\n    t_group_1.join()\n    t_group_2.join()\n\n    run_dependent_3()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Task Grouping:** You have grouped tasks 1-3 and 4-6 into two separate functions (`run_tasks_1_to_3` and `run_tasks_4_to_6`) to manage their parallel execution and dependencies.\n\n2. **Threading:** Each task is executed on a separate thread within its group, and the threads are joined to ensure that dependent tasks only run after all tasks in the group are completed.\n\n3. **Dependency Management:** The `dependent1` and `dependent2` functions are called after their respective groups of tasks are completed.\n\n4. **Final Dependency:** After both task groups finish and their dependents execute, `dependent3` is called.\n\nThis structure ensures that all possible tasks run in parallel, respecting the dependencies you specified."
