The current implementation using subprocess.call does not support parallel execution and my attempt to use multi-threading does not seem to be correct.\n\nHere is my current code:\n\n```\nimport subprocess\n\n#setup\ndo_setup()\n\n#run scriptA\nsubprocess.call(scriptA + argumentsA)\nsubprocess.call(scriptA + argumentsB)\nsubprocess.call(scriptA + argumentsC)\n\n#finish\ndo_finish()\n```\n\nI also tried to use threading like this:\n\n```\nfrom threading import Thread\nimport subprocess\n\ndef call_script(args)\n    subprocess.call(args)\n\n#run scriptA   \nt1 = Thread(target=call_script, args=(scriptA + argumentsA))\nt2 = Thread(target=call_script, args=(scriptA + argumentsB))\nt3 = Thread(target=call_script, args=(scriptA + argumentsC))\nt1.start()\nt2.start()\nt3.start()\n```\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is the correct approach. How could I know when all instances of scriptA.py have finished running before moving on to `do_finish()`?"

        "content": "To execute multiple instances of a script with different arguments simultaneously and ensure that the main script waits for all instances to finish before proceeding, you can use the `concurrent.futures` module. This module provides a simple interface for asynchronously executing functions using threading or multiprocessing. Since you're dealing with subprocesses, using `ProcessPoolExecutor` is more appropriate.\n\nHere's how you can modify your script to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\nfrom concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor, as_completed\n\ndef call_script(args):\n    subprocess.call(args)\n\n# Setup\ndo_setup()\n\n# Define the script and its different arguments\ntasks = [\n    (scriptA + argumentsA),\n    (scriptA + argumentsB),\n    (scriptA + argumentsC)\n]\n\n# Execute scriptA with different arguments in parallel\nwith ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:\n    # Submit all tasks to the executor\n    futures = {executor.submit(call_script, task): task for task in tasks}\n    \n    # Wait for all tasks to complete\n    for future in as_completed(futures):\n        task = futures[future]\n        try:\n            result = future.result()  # This will also re-raise any exceptions\n            print(f\"Task {task} completed successfully.\")\n        except Exception as exc:\n            print(f\"Task {task} generated an exception: {exc}\")\n\n# Finish\ndo_finish()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **`ProcessPoolExecutor`**: This is used to run subprocesses in parallel. It's ideal for CPU-bound tasks or when you need to execute separate processes simultaneously.\n\n- **`as_completed`**: This function helps in iterating over the futures as they complete. This way, you can handle the results or exceptions of each subprocess call.\n\n- **Exception Handling**: The use of `try` and `except` within the loop allows you to manage any exceptions that are raised during the execution of the subprocesses.\n\nThis approach ensures that all your instances of `scriptA.py` will run concurrently and `do_finish()` will be called only after all processes have completed."
