        "content": "The error you're encountering indicates that your Python script is unable to connect to the MongoDB server on `localhost:27017`. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check if MongoDB is Running:**\n   Ensure that the MongoDB server is running. You can do this by checking the status of the MongoDB service. On Linux, you can use the following command:\n   ```bash\n   sudo systemctl status mongod\n   ```\n   If it's not running, start it with:\n   ```bash\n   sudo systemctl start mongod\n   ```\n\n2. **Check MongoDB Configuration:**\n   Make sure that MongoDB is configured to listen on the correct IP address and port. Check the MongoDB configuration file, typically located at `/etc/mongod.conf`, and verify the `bindIp` and `port` settings. The default port is 27017, and `bindIp` should include `127.0.0.1` for local connections.\n\n3. **Check Firewall Settings:**\n   If you're running a firewall, ensure that port 27017 is open for incoming connections. You can adjust your firewall settings using `ufw` on Ubuntu:\n   ```bash\n   sudo ufw allow 27017\n   ```\n\n4. **Use the Correct pymongo Module:**\n   The `Connection` class is deprecated. Instead, use the `MongoClient` class. Here's how you can update your code:\n   ```python\n   from pymongo import MongoClient\n   client = MongoClient('localhost', 27017)\n   ```\n\n5. **Check Network Connectivity:**\n   Verify that there are no network issues preventing the connection. You can try connecting to the MongoDB server using a different client or tool, such as `mongo` shell, to ensure connectivity:\n   ```bash\n   mongo --host localhost --port 27017\n   ```\n\n6. **Review MongoDB Logs:**\n   Check MongoDB logs for any errors or warnings. The logs are usually located in `/var/log/mongodb/mongod.log` by default.\n\n7. **Version Compatibility:**\n   Ensure that your version of `pymongo` is compatible with your MongoDB server version. You can update `pymongo` using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade pymongo\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the connection issue. If the problem persists, please provide additional details about your environment for further assistance."
