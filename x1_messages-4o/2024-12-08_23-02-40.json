Specifically, how can I include five distinct options: stress reduction, enhanced focus, greater self-awareness, strengthened immune system, and decreased likelihood of cardiovascular disease? Additionally, could you kindly provide an example code snippet that generates this question and presents the aforementioned answer choices?"

        "content": "Designing a multiple-choice question in Java involves creating a simple console application or a graphical user interface (GUI) where you present the question and the options to the user. Below is an example of how you might create a console-based multiple-choice question in Java that assesses the advantages of yoga for mental well-being:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class YogaBenefitsQuiz {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Define the question and answer choices\n        String question = \"Which of the following is an advantage of yoga for mental well-being?\";\n        String[] options = {\n            \"1. Stress reduction\",\n            \"2. Enhanced focus\",\n            \"3. Greater self-awareness\",\n            \"4. Strengthened immune system\",\n            \"5. Decreased likelihood of cardiovascular disease\"\n        };\n\n        // Display the question and options\n        System.out.println(question);\n        for (String option : options) {\n            System.out.println(option);\n        }\n\n        // Prompt the user for an answer\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        System.out.print(\"Please enter the number corresponding to your answer: \");\n        int userChoice = scanner.nextInt();\n\n        // Check if the user's choice is valid and give feedback\n        switch (userChoice) {\n            case 1:\n                System.out.println(\"Correct! Yoga can help reduce stress.\");\n                break;\n            case 2:\n                System.out.println(\"Correct! Yoga can enhance focus.\");\n                break;\n            case 3:\n                System.out.println(\"Correct! Yoga can increase self-awareness.\");\n                break;\n            case 4:\n                System.out.println(\"Correct! Yoga can strengthen the immune system.\");\n                break;\n            case 5:\n                System.out.println(\"Correct! Yoga can decrease the likelihood of cardiovascular disease.\");\n                break;\n            default:\n                System.out.println(\"Invalid choice. Please select a number between 1 and 5.\");\n                break;\n        }\n\n        // Close the scanner\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Question and Options**: The question is clearly defined, and the options are listed in an array for easy access and iteration.\n- **User Input**: The program uses a `Scanner` to capture the user's input.\n- **Feedback**: A switch statement is used to give immediate feedback based on the user's choice.\n- **Validation**: The program checks for valid input and provides feedback if the input is invalid.\n\nThis simple console application effectively presents a multiple-choice question and checks the user's response, serving as a basic template for creating a more sophisticated quiz application if desired."
