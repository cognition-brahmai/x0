Open your terminal and type:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -c \"import sys; print(sys.executable)\"\n   ```\n\n   This command runs a short Python script that imports the `sys` module and prints the path to the Python interpreter.\n\n2. **Using `which` command (Linux/Mac):**\n   If you're on a Unix-based system, you can use the `which` command to find the location of the Python executable:\n\n   ```bash\n   which python\n   ```\n\n   This will return the path of the Python executable that is being invoked.\n\n3. **Using `where` command (Windows):**\n   If you're on Windows, you can use the `where` command:\n\n   ```cmd\n   where python\n   ```\n\n   This will display the path(s) of the Python executable(s) found in your system's PATH environment variable.\n\nBy performing one of these steps, you should be able to determine the installation path of the Python version that is currently being used."
