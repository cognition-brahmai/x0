The error message I receive is: \"django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: Requested setting CACHES, but settings are not configured. You must either define the environment variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE or call settings.configure() before accessing settings.\" The scripts run fine when I use \"python3 ./manage.py runserver,\" but tests fail with the error mentioned. I have already set the environment variable in my manage.py file as \"os.environ.setdefault(\"DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\", \"<appname>.settings\")\". I have tried running tests both in PyCharm Professional IDE and in the shell using \"python3 manage.py test\", but the shell does not find any tests. I've also tried calling \"settings.configure()\", but it says it's already configured. I'm not using any database with Django and have commented out the appropriate parts in the settings. Any suggestions on how to resolve this?"

        "content": "It sounds like you are experiencing an issue with Django's settings configuration when running tests. Here are several steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE**: Ensure the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable is properly set before running your tests. You can do this by adding the following lines at the top of your test file or within a setup script:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', '<appname>.settings')\n   ```\n\n2. **Ensure Test Discovery**: Make sure your test files and test methods follow Django's test discovery pattern. Specifically, they should be named with the prefix `test_` or contain the word `Test` in the class name. Also, ensure your test methods start with `test_`.\n\n3. **Check for __init__.py**: Ensure that your test directories contain an `__init__.py` file so that they are recognized as Python packages. This helps with test discovery.\n\n4. **Use Django's Test Runner**: Run your tests using Django's test runner to ensure proper configuration loading:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 manage.py test\n   ```\n\n5. **Check for Configuration Conflicts**: If you have attempted to call `settings.configure()` manually, ensure that it isn't conflicting with Django's automatic configuration process. It's usually not necessary to call `settings.configure()` manually unless you are in a non-Django script.\n\n6. **Review Settings.py**: Double-check your `settings.py` to ensure there are no syntax errors or misconfigurations, particularly with cache settings and other middleware settings.\n\n7. **Database Settings**: Even though you are not using a database, ensure that your `DATABASES` setting in `settings.py` is properly configured. For testing purposes, you can use:\n\n   ```python\n   DATABASES = {\n       'default': {\n           'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.dummy',\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n8. **Check for Environment-Specific Settings**: If you have multiple settings files for different environments, ensure that the correct one is being loaded during test execution.\n\n9. **Debug Print Statements**: Add debug print statements in your test setup to check if the settings are being loaded correctly.\n\n10. **PyCharm Configuration**: If you are using PyCharm, ensure that the test runner is configured to use the correct Python interpreter and environment variables.\n\nIf you've tried all of the above and the issue persists, consider setting up a minimal version of your project to isolate the problem or provide additional context on the specific setup you have. Debugging configurations can sometimes be tricky, but with a methodical approach, you should be able to identify the root cause."
