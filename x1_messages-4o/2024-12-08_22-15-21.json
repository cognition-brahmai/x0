        "content": "The sentence is best completed by option B) 1998, as it is the year when the International Space Station (ISS) was launched.\n\n### History and Current State of the International Space Station\n\nThe International Space Station (ISS) is a collaborative project between five space agencies: NASA (United States), Roscosmos (Russia), JAXA (Japan), ESA (European Space Agency), and CSA (Canada). The construction of the ISS began in 1998 and it has been continuously inhabited since November 2000. It serves as a unique laboratory for conducting scientific research in microgravity, enabling advancements in biology, human biology, physics, astronomy, and other fields. The ISS also serves as a platform for international cooperation in space exploration. As of now, the ISS remains a critical asset for space exploration, though discussions about its future beyond the 2020s are ongoing, with potential plans for commercialization or deorbiting.\n\n### Comparison of Space Structures\n\n| Structure                    | Launch Date | Purpose                            | Dimensions (m) |\n|------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------|----------------|\n| International Space Station  | 1998        | Human habitation and research      | 73 x 109 x 20  |\n| Hubble Space Telescope       | 1990        | Astronomy observation              | 13.2 x 4.2     |\n| Kepler Space Observatory     | 2009        | Exoplanet observation              | 4.7 x 4.4      |\n\nThe International Space Station is significantly larger than both the Hubble Space Telescope and the Kepler Space Observatory, reflecting its role as a habitat and research facility for astronauts. While the ISS focuses on human-related research in microgravity, both Hubble and Kepler are dedicated to astronomical observations, with Hubble focusing on general astronomy and Kepler on finding exoplanets.\n\n### Potential Long-term Effects of Continuous Human Habitation in Space\n\nContinuous human habitation in space presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities. Physically, prolonged exposure to microgravity can lead to muscle atrophy, bone density loss, and cardiovascular changes, necessitating regular exercise and medical monitoring. Furthermore, life support systems must be advanced enough to create self-sustaining artificial ecosystems, recycling air, water, and waste to support human life.\n\nPsychologically, the isolation and confinement of space habitats can impact mental health, causing stress, anxiety, and depression among astronauts. Effective countermeasures include strong communication links with Earth, recreational activities, and psychological support.\n\nOn the positive side, long-term space habitation drives the development of new technologies in life support, robotics, and materials science. These advancements could accelerate future space colonization efforts, enabling humanity to establish permanent settlements on the Moon, Mars, or even beyond. Such endeavors could secure the survival of our species and expand human presence into the cosmos, offering new opportunities for exploration and discovery."
