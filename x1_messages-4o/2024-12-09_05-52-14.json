        "content": "Yes, it is possible to create dynamic keywords in Python, especially when you're dealing with Django QuerySets. You can achieve this by using Python's dictionary unpacking feature, which allows you to construct your filter arguments dynamically. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve that:\n\n```python\ncurrency = 'usd'  # This can be dynamically set to any currency code\nmin_price = 10\nmax_price = 100\n\n# Build the dynamic filter keyword\nfilter_key = f'min_price__{currency}__range'\n\n# Use dictionary unpacking to pass the dynamic keyword argument\nqset.filter(**{filter_key: (min_price, max_price)})\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, `filter_key` is constructed as a string that represents the dynamic field name you want to filter on. The dictionary `{filter_key: (min_price, max_price)}` is then unpacked into the `filter` method using `**`, allowing you to pass dynamic keyword arguments to the method. This approach provides flexibility in building your queries based on variable conditions."
