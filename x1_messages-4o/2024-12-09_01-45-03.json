Here's how you can accomplish selecting columns that begin with the letter 'd':\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {'a': [10], 'b': [14], 'c': [12], 'd1': [44], 'd2': [45], 'd3': [78]}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Selecting columns that start with 'd'\ndf_d_columns = df.filter(like='d')\n\nprint(df_d_columns)\n```\n\nThis will result in a DataFrame containing only the columns `d1`, `d2`, and `d3`. This method is efficient and leverages the built-in functionality of Pandas to filter columns based on a substring present in the column names."
