And using that complementary color, what are five adjectives that could describe the resulting color? \n[Formula]: To calculate the complementary color of a given color in RGB, subtract each color value from 255. For blue, the complementary color would be orange (255-0, 255-0, 255-255). Some adjectives to describe the resulting color could be warm, vibrant, energetic, cheerful, and playful."

Applying the formula:\n\n- Red: 255 - 0 = 255\n- Green: 255 - 0 = 255\n- Blue: 255 - 255 = 0\n\nSo, the complementary color of blue is (255, 255, 0), which is yellow.\n\nHere are five adjectives that could describe the resulting color (yellow):\n\n1. Bright\n2. Sunny\n3. Lively\n4. Radiant\n5. Joyful"
