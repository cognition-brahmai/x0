First, find the difference between the y-coordinates and the difference between the x-coordinates. Then, divide the difference in y-coordinates by the difference in x-coordinates to get the slope. Finally, use one of the given points and the slope to solve for the y-intercept using basic arithmetic operations. What is the slope and y-intercept of the line passing through these two points?"

Let's use the point (4, 9).\n\n4. **Use the point-slope form to solve for the y-intercept:**\n   The equation of the line in slope-intercept form is \\( y = mx + b \\).\n   Substituting the slope and one point into the equation:\n   \\[\n   9 = \\frac{3}{2}(4) + b\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\times 4 \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{2} \\times 4 = 6\n   \\]\n\n6. **Plug the value back into the equation:**\n   \\[\n   9 = 6 + b\n   \\]\n\n7. **Solve for b:**\n   \\[\n   b = 9 - 6 = 3\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the slope of the line is \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\) and the y-intercept is 3."
