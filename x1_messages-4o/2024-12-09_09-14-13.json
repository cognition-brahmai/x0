        "content": "Yes, you can convert a binary number to a decimal number in Python using the built-in `int()` function. The `int()` function can take two arguments: the string representation of the number and the base of that number. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Binary number as a string\nbinary_number = '1011'\n\n# Convert binary to decimal\ndecimal_number = int(binary_number, 2)\n\nprint(f\"The decimal representation of binary {binary_number} is {decimal_number}.\")\n```\n\nIn this example, `'1011'` is the binary number, and `2` is its base. The `int()` function converts it to the decimal equivalent, which is `11`."
