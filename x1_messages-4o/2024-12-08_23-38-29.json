However, there is a new constraint that you must follow. In addition to the existing rules, you must also ensure that the final sum of all the modified numbers in the list is a perfect square. The rules for performing the operations are as follows:\n- For every number in the list that is divisible by 3, add 7 to it.\n- For every prime number in the list, subtract the next higher prime number from it.\n- For every non-prime number in the list, add the next lower non-prime number to it.\nYour task is to create a set of instructions that can be given to the AI language model to successfully complete this task while ensuring that the final sum of all the modified numbers in the list is a perfect square. Think carefully and use your puzzle-solving skills to create the perfect set of instructions that will lead the AI system to success!"

        "content": "To successfully complete this Math Puzzle Challenge, we need a strategy that applies the given rules and ensures the final sum is a perfect square. Here is a step-by-step set of instructions to achieve this:\n\n1. **Identify and Modify Divisible by 3:**\n   - Iterate through the list of numbers.\n   - For each number divisible by 3, add 7 to it.\n   - Keep track of the modified numbers separately.\n\n2. **Identify and Modify Prime Numbers:**\n   - For each number in the list, check if it is a prime number.\n   - If it is a prime, identify the next higher prime number.\n   - Subtract this next higher prime from the current prime number.\n   - Keep track of these modified prime numbers separately.\n\n3. **Identify and Modify Non-Prime Numbers:**\n   - For each number that is not a prime, identify the next lower non-prime number.\n   - Add this next lower non-prime number to the current non-prime number.\n   - Keep track of these modified non-prime numbers separately.\n\n4. **Calculate the Sum:**\n   - Sum all the modified numbers from steps 1, 2, and 3.\n   - Check if this sum is a perfect square.\n\n5. **Adjust to Achieve Perfect Square:**\n   - If the sum is not a perfect square, adjust the numbers:\n     - Calculate the nearest perfect square to the current sum.\n     - Determine the difference between the current sum and this nearest perfect square.\n     - Adjust the numbers in the list by either modifying a number (if the difference is small) or re-evaluating the closest prime/non-prime numbers used in the modifications to achieve the perfect square.\n\n6. **Re-calculate if Necessary:**\n   - After adjustments, re-calculate the sum to ensure it is now a perfect square.\n   - Iterate through steps 4 and 5 if further adjustments are needed.\n\n7. **Output the Result:**\n   - Once the sum is a perfect square, output the final list of modified numbers and the perfect square sum.\n\nBy applying these steps, the AI system can systematically solve the puzzle, ensuring that all conditions (including the perfect square constraint) are satisfied."
