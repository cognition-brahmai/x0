I am trying to count the number of occurrences of each of these strings and then divide the number of counts by the sum of all the counts. To achieve this, I have written code in Pandas as such:\n\n```python\nfunc = lambda x: x.size() / x.sum()\ndata = frame.groupby('my_labels').apply(func)\n```\n\nHowever, this code gives me an error saying 'DataFrame object has no attribute 'size'. Could you guide me on how to correctly apply a function to calculate this in Pandas?"

        "content": "Certainly! The error you're encountering is because you're trying to use `size()` as a method on a group, but it should be a property. Additionally, the calculation logic seems incorrect for your purpose. Here's how you can achieve the desired result using Pandas:\n\n1. Use `value_counts()` to count the occurrences of each label.\n2. Divide the counts by the total sum to get the relative frequency.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\n# Count the occurrences of each label\ncounts = frame['my_labels'].value_counts()\n\n# Calculate the relative frequency of each label\nrelative_frequency = counts / counts.sum()\n\nprint(relative_frequency)\n```\n\nThis code will give you a Series where the index is the unique labels and the values are the relative frequencies. This approach avoids the need for groupby and directly calculates the desired values."
