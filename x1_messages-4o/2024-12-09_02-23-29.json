I am currently using subprocess.Popen to call a CMD executable, but it seems to exit before any output can be generated. How can I delay the exit until the outputs are generated? Here is the code I am currently using:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess, sys\nfrom subprocess import Popen, PIPE\nexe_str = r\"C:/Windows/System32/cmd C:/temp/calc.exe\"\n\nparent = subprocess.Popen(exe_str, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)\n```"

        "content": "To ensure that your Python script waits for the external executable to complete before exiting, you can use the `subprocess.run()` function or the `wait()` method with `subprocess.Popen`. Let's explore both methods:\n\n### Using `subprocess.run()`\n\nThis is a simpler and modern way to run an external command and wait for it to complete:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\nexe_str = r\"C:/temp/calc.exe\"\n\n# Run the command and wait for it to complete\nresult = subprocess.run(exe_str, shell=True, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)\n\n# You can access the output and errors using result.stdout and result.stderr\nprint(\"Output:\", result.stdout.decode())\nprint(\"Errors:\", result.stderr.decode())\n```\n\n### Using `subprocess.Popen` and `wait()`\n\nIf you want to continue using `subprocess.Popen`, you can call `wait()` on the process object to wait for it to complete:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\nexe_str = r\"C:/temp/calc.exe\"\n\n# Start the process\nparent = subprocess.Popen(exe_str, shell=True, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)\n\n# Wait for the process to complete\nstdout, stderr = parent.communicate()\n\n# You can access the output and errors from stdout and stderr\nprint(\"Output:\", stdout.decode())\nprint(\"Errors:\", stderr.decode())\n```\n\n### Important Notes:\n\n1. **Use `shell=True`**: Since you're running an executable via the command line, ensure `shell=True` to allow the shell to interpret the command string correctly.\n\n2. **Path to Executable**: Ensure the path to your executable (`calc.exe`) is correct and accessible from the script.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Check for any errors in `stderr` to debug issues with running the executable.\n\nBy using either of these methods, your script will wait for the external process to complete, capturing any output or errors generated by the executable."
