        "content": "Creating a C# code to automatically correct subject-verb agreement in a markdown-formatted sentence can be quite complex, as it involves natural language processing capabilities. However, I can guide you through a basic approach using simple string manipulation and pattern matching. More advanced solutions would require integrating a natural language processing library or API.\n\nHere is a basic example of how you might start approaching this problem:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Text.RegularExpressions;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        string sentence = \"The group of diligent students is determined to pursue their studies.\";\n        string correctedSentence = CorrectSubjectVerbAgreement(sentence);\n        Console.WriteLine(correctedSentence);\n    }\n\n    static string CorrectSubjectVerbAgreement(string sentence)\n    {\n        // Define a regex pattern to identify the subject and verb\n        string pattern = @\"(\\bgroup\\b.*?\\bstudents\\b)\\s+is\\b\";\n        Regex regex = new Regex(pattern, RegexOptions.IgnoreCase);\n\n        // Replace the incorrect verb with the correct one\n        string result = regex.Replace(sentence, \"$1 are\");\n        \n        return result;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Regex Pattern**: The pattern `(\\bgroup\\b.*?\\bstudents\\b)\\s+is\\b` is used to capture the phrase \"group of diligent students\" and the verb \"is\". \n   - `\\bgroup\\b` ensures we match the whole word \"group\".\n   - `.*?` is a non-greedy match for any characters between \"group\" and \"students\".\n   - `\\bstudents\\b` ensures we match the whole word \"students\".\n   - `\\s+is\\b` matches the whitespace and the whole word \"is\".\n\n2. **Replacement**: The `regex.Replace` method is used to replace the matched \"is\" with \"are\".\n\nThis is a simplistic approach and will work for this specific example. However, subject-verb agreement can vary widely depending on sentence structure and context, so for more robust solutions, consider using NLP libraries like Stanford NLP, spaCy (via Python integration), or external APIs that specialize in grammar correction."
