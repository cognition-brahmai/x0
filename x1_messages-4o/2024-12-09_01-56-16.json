        "content": "I have three different models, each applying to a specific domain. They are trained separately with different datasets and inference is sequential. I initially tried to parallelize these three models using Python's Multiprocess library, but it is unstable and not recommended. I decided to make a single model with multiple inputs and outputs that shares a common pretrained-model. I understand that this is possible with Keras' Functional API but I am unsure how to implement it. I have provided my code but it returns an error due to the line with `layers.concatenate(...)`. It propagates a shape that is not taken into account by the `EfficientNet` model. My inputs are images of dimensions (200,200,3). Can anyone guide me in creating a multi-input multi-output model that shares a common structure?"

        "content": "Certainly! Creating a multi-input, multi-output model in Keras using the Functional API can be a bit tricky, especially when integrating a common pretrained model like EfficientNet. Let's go through the process step by step.\n\nHere's how you can approach it:\n\n1. **Common Base Model**: Use a common pretrained model (like EfficientNet) which will serve as a feature extractor. You'll need to ensure the input shape is compatible with EfficientNet.\n\n2. **Separate Input Layers**: Since you have multiple inputs, you'll define separate input layers for each of them.\n\n3. **Concatenation**: If the outputs from these separate paths need to be combined, ensure they are compatible in terms of dimensions.\n\n4. **Multi-output Paths**: Define separate paths for each output after the common base model.\n\nHere's a sample code structure to guide you:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Model\nfrom tensorflow.keras.applications import EfficientNetB0\n\n# Define the input layers\ninput1 = Input(shape=(200, 200, 3), name='input_1')\ninput2 = Input(shape=(200, 200, 3), name='input_2')\ninput3 = Input(shape=(200, 200, 3), name='input_3')\n\n# Load a common pretrained model (e.g., EfficientNet) without the top layer\nbase_model = EfficientNetB0(include_top=False, weights='imagenet')\n\n# Process each input through the base model\nx1 = base_model(input1)\nx2 = base_model(input2)\nx3 = base_model(input3)\n\n# Flatten or pool the outputs\nx1 = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x1)\nx2 = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x2)\nx3 = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x3)\n\n# If the outputs need to be concatenated, do so here\n# This is only necessary if you need to combine features from multiple inputs for a single output\n# combined = layers.concatenate([x1, x2, x3], axis=-1)\n\n# Define separate outputs\noutput1 = Dense(10, activation='softmax', name='output_1')(x1)  # Example output\noutput2 = Dense(5, activation='softmax', name='output_2')(x2)   # Example output\noutput3 = Dense(3, activation='softmax', name='output_3')(x3)   # Example output\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = Model(inputs=[input1, input2, input3], outputs=[output1, output2, output3])\n\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Display the model summary\nmodel.summary()\n```\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Input Shapes**: Ensure that your inputs are of the correct size expected by the base model.\n- **Pooling Layers**: Using a GlobalAveragePooling2D layer helps reduce the dimensions of the features extracted by the base model, making them easier to handle.\n- **Output Layers**: Customize the output layers as per the requirements of each task (number of classes, activation functions, etc.).\n- **Model Compilation**: Use appropriate loss functions and metrics, especially if your outputs are for different types of tasks (e.g., classification, regression).\n\nThis code provides a basic framework. Depending on the specifics of your tasks (number of classes, types of outputs), you may need to adjust the output layers and loss functions accordingly."
