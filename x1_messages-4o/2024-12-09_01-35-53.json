Here is my code:\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport requests\n\nworkingFile = 'D:\\\\test.json'\n\nwith open(workingFile, 'r') as fh:\n    data = json.load(fh)\n\nurl = 'http://jsontest'\nusername = 'user'\npassword = 'password123'\n\nrequestpost = requests.post(url, json=data, auth=(username, password))\n\nprint(requestpost[\"requestId\"])\n```\n\nHow can I correctly access the `requestId` field from the response object?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, `'Response' object is not subscriptable`, is due to attempting to access the JSON data directly from the `Response` object using subscript notation. The `requests` library's `Response` object provides a `.json()` method that you can use to parse the JSON content of the response. Here's how you can modify your code to access the `requestId` field correctly:\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport requests\n\nworkingFile = 'D:\\\\test.json'\n\nwith open(workingFile, 'r') as fh:\n    data = json.load(fh)\n\nurl = 'http://jsontest'\nusername = 'user'\npassword = 'password123'\n\n# Make the POST request\nresponse = requests.post(url, json=data, auth=(username, password))\n\n# Use the .json() method to parse the JSON response\nresponse_json = response.json()\n\n# Access the 'requestId' field\nrequest_id = response_json.get(\"requestId\")\n\nprint(request_id)\n```\n\nHere are the key changes and explanations:\n\n1. **`response.json()`**: Use this method to retrieve the JSON content of the response, which returns a dictionary that you can then work with using standard dictionary methods.\n\n2. **`.get(\"requestId\")`**: This safely accesses the `requestId` field from the dictionary. Using `.get()` is beneficial as it returns `None` if the key doesn't exist, avoiding a potential `KeyError`.\n\nThis should resolve the error and allow you to access the `requestId` field successfully."
