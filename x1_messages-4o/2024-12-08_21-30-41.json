Below is a Java program that prompts the user for information about John and then displays the information in the specified format.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class JohnProfile {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        // Prompt for John's age\n        System.out.print(\"Enter John's age: \");\n        int age = scanner.nextInt();\n\n        // Prompt for John's height\n        System.out.print(\"Enter John's height (e.g., 5.9 for 5 feet 9 inches): \");\n        double height = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        // Prompt for John's weight\n        System.out.print(\"Enter John's weight in pounds: \");\n        double weight = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        // Clear the buffer\n        scanner.nextLine();\n\n        // Prompt for John's occupation\n        System.out.print(\"Enter John's occupation: \");\n        String occupation = scanner.nextLine();\n\n        // Display John's information\n        System.out.println(\"John is \" + age + \" years old, \" + height + \" feet tall, weighs \" + weight + \" pounds, and works as a \" + occupation + \".\");\n\n        // Close the scanner\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### How to Run the Code:\n1. Copy the code into a file named `JohnProfile.java`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt.\n3. Navigate to the directory containing `JohnProfile.java`.\n4. Compile the program using the command: `javac JohnProfile.java`.\n5. Run the compiled program using the command: `java JohnProfile`.\n6. Follow the prompts to input John's age, height, weight, and occupation.\n7. The program will output John's complete profile based on the inputs.\n\nThis program uses `Scanner` to collect user input and then formats and displays the information as a single sentence."
