I would like to enable the user to provide the program with a different name and password. I have managed to add arguments for name and password like so:\n\n```python\nparser.add_argument(\n    '-n',\n    '--name',\n    help='the login name that you wish the program to use'\n)\n\nparser.add_argument(\n    '-p',\n    '--password',\n    help='the password to log in with.'\n)\n```\n\nHowever, my requirement is such that it doesn't make sense to specify only the name or only the password, but it would make sense to specify neither. I have noticed that argparse has the ability to specify that two arguments are mutually exclusive, but my requirement involves two arguments that must appear together. How can I implement this in Python argparse? I found \"argument groups\" mentioned in the docs, but they don't appear to solve my problem."

        "content": "To enforce that two arguments must appear together in argparse, you can implement a custom check after parsing the arguments. While argparse doesn't directly support the requirement that two arguments must be provided together, you can easily enforce this rule by checking the presence of one argument and ensuring that the other one is present as well. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport argparse\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Program description here.')\n    \n    parser.add_argument(\n        '-n',\n        '--name',\n        help='the login name that you wish the program to use'\n    )\n\n    parser.add_argument(\n        '-p',\n        '--password',\n        help='the password to log in with.'\n    )\n    \n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    # Check if one of the arguments is provided without the other\n    if (args.name and not args.password) or (args.password and not args.name):\n        parser.error(\"Both --name and --password must be provided together.\")\n    \n    # If both are None or both are provided, the program can proceed\n    # Your logic here using args.name and args.password\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this code, after parsing the arguments, we perform a manual check to ensure that if one of `--name` or `--password` is provided, the other must be provided as well. If this condition is violated, the program raises an error with a helpful message. This approach provides the flexibility to specify neither or both, but not just one."
