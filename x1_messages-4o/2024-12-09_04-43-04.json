        "content": "The error you're encountering, `ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package`, typically occurs when you're trying to run a script directly that uses relative imports. In Python, relative imports are meant to be used within a package, and they require a known parent package to resolve the relative paths.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Run as a Module**: Instead of running your script directly, run it as a module using the `-m` flag. For example, if your script is part of a package and is located in the directory `mypackage`, you should navigate to the directory containing `mypackage` and run:\n   ```bash\n   python -m mypackage.your_script_name\n   ```\n   This way, Python will treat `mypackage` as a package, and the relative import will work correctly.\n\n2. **Use Absolute Imports**: If possible, change your relative import to an absolute import. Instead of:\n   ```python\n   from ..box_utils import decode, nms\n   ```\n   Use:\n   ```python\n   from mypackage.box_utils import decode, nms\n   ```\n   This requires that your package structure and the Python path are set up correctly.\n\n3. **Check Your Project Structure**: Ensure that your project is structured as a package. There should be an `__init__.py` file in the directories that you want Python to recognize as packages. This file can be empty, but it tells Python to treat the directory as a package.\n\n4. **Adjust Your PYTHONPATH**: If you're having trouble with imports, it can sometimes help to adjust your `PYTHONPATH` to include the directory containing your top-level package. You can do this temporarily in your terminal session with:\n   ```bash\n   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/your/project\n   ```\n   Or, on Windows:\n   ```cmd\n   set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\\path\\to\\your\\project\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the import error and successfully use relative imports in your project."
