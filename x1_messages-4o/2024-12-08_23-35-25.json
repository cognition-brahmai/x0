        "content": "For a nautical-themed nursery, a unique and charming mobile or hanging decoration could be a handcrafted driftwood and sea glass mobile. This would feature pieces of smooth driftwood, delicately colored sea glass in blues, greens, and whites, and perhaps small seashells or starfish accents. The natural materials will complement the soothing, oceanic tones of the room, while the gentle clinking of sea glass can add a calming auditory element. Additionally, you might consider a mobile with miniature sailboats, whales, or anchors crafted from felt or wood, which would add a playful touch while maintaining the theme. These can be suspended with clear fishing line to give the appearance of floating in air, enhancing the nautical ambiance."
