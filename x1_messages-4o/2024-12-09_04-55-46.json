        "content": "The errors you're encountering are due to incorrect data types being used in your operations. Let's address each part of the code.\n\n1. **First Version**: The error occurs because `char` in the loop is a string (character), but you're trying to add an integer to it directly. You need to use `ord(char)` to get the Unicode code point of the character before performing arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Second Version**: There are a few issues:\n   - You're trying to convert the whole input message to an integer, which doesn't make sense for a string input.\n   - You're using `ord(char - str(742146))`, which is incorrect due to mixing string and integer operations.\n\nHere's the corrected version of your code for both encoding and decoding processes:\n\n### Encoding Version\n```python\nmessage = input(\"Enter a message you want to be encoded: \")\nsecret_string = \"\"\nfor char in message:\n    # Convert each character to its Unicode code point and add a number\n    secret_string += chr(ord(char) + 7429146)\nprint(\"Encoded:\", secret_string)\n```\n\n### Decoding Version\n```python\nencoded_message = input(\"Enter the encoded message you want to be decoded: \")\ndecoded_string = \"\"\nfor char in encoded_message:\n    # Convert each character back to the original by subtracting the number\n    decoded_string += chr(ord(char) - 7429146)\nprint(\"Decoded:\", decoded_string)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- Use `ord(char)` to get the Unicode code point of a character before performing arithmetic operations.\n- Use `chr()` to convert a Unicode code point back to a character.\n- Ensure that the addition (for encoding) and subtraction (for decoding) use the same number to maintain consistency.\n\nMake sure the added number (7429146) does not exceed the Unicode range, which might cause issues with unrepresentable characters. Adjust the number if necessary."
