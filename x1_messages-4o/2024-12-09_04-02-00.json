Previously, I was able to compile and execute other programs using nvcc and makefiles without any issues. I have included my `Makefile.inc` and `Makefile` for reference. When I attempt to compile, the complete error message I receive is the following:\n\n```\n...Heat_Transfer_CUDA$ make\nCompile HeatTransfer/mesh.cu\nnvcc -O3 -I./inc -c HeatTransfer/mesh.cu -o obj/mesh.o\nCompile HeatTransfer/stack.cu\nnvcc -O3 -I./inc -c HeatTransfer/stack.cu -o obj/stack.o\nLink bin/program\nnvcc -O3 -I./inc  ./obj/mesh.o  ./obj/stack.o -O3 -I./inc -o bin/program\nnvcc fatal   : redefinition of argument 'optimize'\nmake: *** [bin/program] Error 1\n```\nI'm unable to find a solution for this error and would appreciate any assistance. As I'm new to CUDA, if additional information is required, please let me know."

        "content": "The error message \"nvcc fatal: redefinition of argument 'optimize'\" suggests that the `-O3` optimization flag is being specified more than once during the linking stage of your compilation process. This can occur if the flag is applied redundantly in your `Makefile`.\n\nLet's address this issue by reviewing and potentially modifying your `Makefile` and `Makefile.inc`. Here's what you can do:\n\n1. **Check `Makefile.inc`:** Ensure that there is no redundant specification of optimization flags. If `-O3` is specified in `CFLAGS`, `LDFLAGS`, or any other variable used during both compilation and linking, it should only appear once in the linking command.\n\n2. **Inspect `Makefile`:** Look for the linking command, which might look something like this:\n   ```makefile\n   $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) -o $(OUTPUT) $(OBJECTS)\n   ```\n   Ensure that `-O3` isn\u2019t being added both in `CFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` or directly in the command line.\n\n3. **Modify Your `Makefile`:** Remove any redundant `-O3` flags from the linking command. You usually only need to optimize once during compilation, not necessarily during linking. Here's a simplified example:\n   ```makefile\n   # Compilation\n   $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@\n\n   # Linking\n   $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) -o $(OUTPUT) $(OBJECTS)\n   ```\n   Ensure that `CFLAGS` includes `-O3` for compilation, but avoid using `-O3` in `LDFLAGS`.\n\n4. **Check Variable Definitions:**\n   ```makefile\n   CFLAGS = -O3 -I./inc\n   LDFLAGS = -I./inc\n   ```\n   With this setup, `CFLAGS` handles optimization, while `LDFLAGS` includes the necessary include paths without optimization.\n\n5. **Clean and Rebuild:** After making changes, run `make clean` (if a clean rule is defined) to remove any object files and binaries, then execute `make` to rebuild the project.\n\nBy ensuring that the optimization flag is not redundantly specified in both compilation and linking steps, you should be able to resolve the issue. If problems persist, please share any relevant portions of your `Makefile` for further assistance."
