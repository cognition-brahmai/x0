        "content": "In the sentence \"He wrote the book in three months,\" the adverbial phrase \"in three months\" functions as a time adverbial. Its role is to provide information about the duration of the action described by the verb \"wrote.\" Specifically, it tells us how long it took for the action of writing the book to be completed.\n\nThe impact of this adverbial phrase on the sentence structure is that it modifies the verb phrase \"wrote the book\" by adding temporal context. Without this phrase, the sentence would simply state that he wrote the book, but it would not convey any information about the time frame of that action. By including \"in three months,\" the sentence becomes more informative, letting the reader know that the book-writing process took a specific amount of time.\n\nIn terms of sentence meaning, \"in three months\" suggests that the writing was completed within that duration, implying a finite and somewhat impressive period in which the task was accomplished. It helps set expectations or provide insight into the efficiency or speed with which the book was written. This can influence how the reader perceives the writer's ability or dedication to the task."
