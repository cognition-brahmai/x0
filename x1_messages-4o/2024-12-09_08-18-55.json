The first one is \"ImportError: No module named _sysconfigdata_nd\" and the second is \"dev_appserver.py: error: unrecognized arguments: --high_replication\". The error logs are as follows:\n\n<pre><code>ERROR    2013-03-25 07:26:43,559 http_runtime.py:221] unexpected port response from runtime ['']; exiting the development server\nERROR    2013-03-25 07:26:43,561 server.py:576] Request to '/_ah/warmup' failed\n</code></pre>\n\nI've never come across the first error before. As for the second one, I used to run Google App Engine applications by setting the --high_replication argument. Why am I suddenly encountering these errors?"

        "content": "The errors you're encountering seem to be related to compatibility and configuration issues following your upgrade to Ubuntu 13.04. Let's address them one by one:\n\n1. **ImportError: No module named _sysconfigdata_nd:**\n\n   This error often occurs when there's a mismatch between the Python environment and the modules required by your project. Here are some steps you can take to resolve it:\n\n   - **Check Python Version:** Ensure you're using a compatible version of Python for your project. Google App Engine typically requires Python 2.7 for older SDKs.\n   \n   - **Virtual Environment:** If not already, consider using a virtual environment for your project. This isolates dependencies and can prevent conflicts.\n   \n   - **Reinstall Python:** Sometimes, reinstalling Python and its associated libraries can resolve such import errors. Use your package manager to reinstall Python and ensure all necessary development headers are installed.\n\n   - **Check PYTHONPATH:** Ensure your PYTHONPATH environment variable is set correctly to include directories where your necessary modules are located.\n\n2. **dev_appserver.py: error: unrecognized arguments: --high_replication:**\n\n   The error indicates that the `--high_replication` argument is not recognized by the version of `dev_appserver.py` you are using. This could be due to changes in the Google App Engine SDK you have after the upgrade. Here\u2019s what you can do:\n\n   - **Update the SDK:** Check if there\u2019s an updated version of the Google App Engine SDK that might have resolved this issue. The `--high_replication` flag may have been deprecated or changed in later versions.\n\n   - **Check Documentation:** Look at the release notes or documentation for the SDK version you are using to see if there have been any changes to command-line arguments.\n\n   - **Alternative Flags:** If `--high_replication` is deprecated, look for alternative flags or configurations in the latest SDK documentation.\n\n3. **General Advice:**\n\n   - **Logs and Debugging:** Review the full error logs to see if there are additional clues about the source of the errors.\n   \n   - **Community and Forums:** Consider checking forums or community discussions specific to Google App Engine or Ubuntu 13.04. Others may have experienced similar issues and found solutions.\n\nBy addressing these areas, you should be able to resolve the errors you're encountering. If you continue to face issues, you might consider reaching out to support communities for more tailored advice based on the specific configuration of your development environment."
