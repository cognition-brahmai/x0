        "content": "I am working with a relatively sparse array in Python using NumPy. I want to go through each row and shuffle only the non-zero elements. For example, if my input array is:\n\n```python\n[2,3,1,0]\n[0,0,2,1]\n```\n\nI want the output to be something like:\n\n```python\n[2,1,3,0]\n[0,0,1,2]\n```\n\nNote that the zeros have not changed their positions. I tried shuffling all elements in each row with the following code:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(len(X)):\n    np.random.shuffle(X[i, :])\n```\n\nThen to shuffle only the non-zero elements, I tried this:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(len(X)):\n    np.random.shuffle(X[i, np.nonzero(X[i, :])])\n```\n\nHowever, it doesn't work as expected. I've noticed that the return type of `X[i, np.nonzero(X[i, :])]` is different from `X[i, :]`. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nIn[30]: X[i, np.nonzero(X[i, :])]\nOut[30]: array([[23,  5, 29, 11, 17]])\n\nIn[31]: X[i, :]\nOut[31]: array([23,  5, 29, 11, 17])\n```\n\nCould this be the reason it's not working? How can I shuffle only the non-zero elements in each row of my array?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering stems from the fact that `np.nonzero(X[i, :])` returns a tuple of arrays, which might cause unexpected behavior when indexing. Instead, you should use `np.flatnonzero`, which returns a 1D array of indices of non-zero elements. You can then use these indices to shuffle only the non-zero elements in each row.\n\nHere's how you can shuffle only the non-zero elements in each row of your array:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Example input array\nX = np.array([\n    [2, 3, 1, 0],\n    [0, 0, 2, 1]\n])\n\n# Iterate over each row\nfor i in range(X.shape[0]):\n    # Find indices of non-zero elements\n    non_zero_indices = np.flatnonzero(X[i, :])\n    \n    # Extract the non-zero elements\n    non_zero_elements = X[i, non_zero_indices]\n    \n    # Shuffle the non-zero elements\n    np.random.shuffle(non_zero_elements)\n    \n    # Place the shuffled elements back into their original positions\n    X[i, non_zero_indices] = non_zero_elements\n\nprint(X)\n```\n\nThis code will shuffle only the non-zero elements in each row of the array `X` while keeping the zeros in their original positions. The key is using `np.flatnonzero` to get the flat indices of non-zero elements, which you can then shuffle and assign back."
