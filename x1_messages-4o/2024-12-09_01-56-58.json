I'm encountering an issue where my breakpoints are ignored when running a flask application from inside Pycharm using `app.run(debug=True)`. I found a solution online suggesting that I should run flask with `app.run(debug=True, use_reloader=False)` for PyCharm to stop on breakpoints, which does work. However, I then lose the autoreloading feature. Is there a way for me to have both the autoreloading feature and the breakpoints working together? I've noticed that both work when I use Python 2.7."

        "content": "When using Flask with PyCharm and encountering issues with breakpoints due to the `use_reloader`, there are a few things you can try to have both autoreloading and breakpoints working together:\n\n1. **Use Flask's Built-in Debugger**: PyCharm's debugger can sometimes conflict with Flask's built-in reloader. If you want to keep the autoreload feature, run the Flask app without PyCharm's debugger and use Flask's built-in debugger instead. This might not fix the breakpoint issue within PyCharm but will provide you with a functional debugger through the terminal.\n\n2. **Configure Remote Debugging**: You can set up remote debugging in PyCharm. This involves starting your Flask application with a special script that connects back to PyCharm\u2019s debugger. Here\u2019s a basic outline:\n   - First, create a Python Debug Server configuration in PyCharm.\n   - Use a script to run your Flask app and connect back to the PyCharm debug server. The script will look something like this:\n     ```python\n     import pydevd_pycharm\n\n     pydevd_pycharm.settrace('localhost', port=5678, stdoutToServer=True, stderrToServer=True)\n     app.run(debug=True)\n     ```\n   - Start your Flask application from the terminal and run the debugger in PyCharm.\n\n3. **Use `flask run` Command**: Instead of using `app.run()`, use the `flask run` command which is more aligned with best practices:\n   - Set the `FLASK_APP` environment variable to point to your application.\n   - Run your application using `flask run --debug`.\n   - This command starts the application with the development server including autoreload and debugging.\n\n4. **Third-Party Libraries**: Consider using third-party solutions like `watchdog` to implement your own reloading mechanism. This way, you can keep the PyCharm debugger intact and handle file changes separately.\n\n5. **Stay Updated**: Since you're using older versions of PyCharm and Flask, consider upgrading if possible. Newer versions of Flask have improved support for debugging and might resolve these issues natively.\n\nWhile these methods may require some additional setup, they allow you to maintain both the convenience of autoreloading and the functionality of breakpoints."
