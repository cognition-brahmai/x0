        "content": "To plot a single straight line that goes through multiple subplots in Matplotlib's Pyplot, you can use the `Axes.inset_axes` or `Axes.inset_locator` functionality to create a figure-wide line that spans all subplots. However, if you want the line to connect points across subplots in a visually continuous way, you can consider overlaying an additional axis that covers the entire figure and use it to plot the line.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. First, create your subplots and plot your data.\n2. Add an additional axis that spans the entire figure.\n3. Plot the line on this additional axis.\n\nHere's an example of how you can do this:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Sample data\nx = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)\ny1 = np.sin(x)\ny2 = np.cos(x)\n\n# Create subplots\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 1, sharex=True, figsize=(6, 8))\n\n# Plot data on subplots\naxs[0].plot(x, y1, 'r.')  # Red dots for subplot 1\naxs[1].plot(x, y2, 'r.')  # Red dots for subplot 2\n\n# Add a new axis that covers the entire figure\nfig_line = fig.add_axes([0, 0, 1, 1], zorder=-1)\nfig_line.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], transform=fig.transFigure, color='blue', linestyle='-')\n\n# Hide the additional axis\nfig_line.set_axis_off()\n\n# Show plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- We create two subplots and plot red dots on each.\n- We add an additional axis (`fig_line`) that spans the entire figure by using the `fig.add_axes([0, 0, 1, 1])` which creates an axis from the bottom-left to top-right corner of the figure.\n- We plot a line on this new axis using `transform=fig.transFigure` to ensure the line spans across the entire figure space.\n- Finally, we hide this additional axis to focus on the line itself.\n\nThis approach allows you to draw a continuous line across the entire figure, visually connecting the subplots. Adjust the line properties as needed to fit your specific requirements."
