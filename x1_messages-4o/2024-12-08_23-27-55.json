        "content": "Creating a comprehensive classification system for planets in the \"Foundation\" series using C# requires defining a structure that can categorize planets based on various physical and chemical properties. Below is an example of how you could structure such a system using classes and enums in C#. This system includes multiple levels of subcategories for detailed analysis and reasoning.\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\n\nnamespace FoundationPlanetClassification\n{\n    // Enum to categorize planets by size\n    enum PlanetSize\n    {\n        Small,\n        Medium,\n        Large,\n        Giant\n    }\n\n    // Enum to categorize planets by atmosphere type\n    enum AtmosphereType\n    {\n        None,\n        Thin,\n        Dense,\n        Toxic\n    }\n\n    // Enum to categorize planets by surface composition\n    enum SurfaceComposition\n    {\n        Rocky,\n        Gaseous,\n        Icy,\n        Metallic\n    }\n\n    // Enum for subcategories based on unique chemical properties\n    enum ChemicalComposition\n    {\n        HydrogenRich,\n        CarbonDioxideRich,\n        MethaneRich,\n        AmmoniaRich,\n        OxygenRich\n    }\n\n    // Class to represent a planet\n    class Planet\n    {\n        public string Name { get; set; }\n        public PlanetSize Size { get; set; }\n        public AtmosphereType Atmosphere { get; set; }\n        public SurfaceComposition Surface { get; set; }\n        public List<ChemicalComposition> Chemicals { get; set; }\n\n        public Planet(string name, PlanetSize size, AtmosphereType atmosphere, SurfaceComposition surface, List<ChemicalComposition> chemicals)\n        {\n            Name = name;\n            Size = size;\n            Atmosphere = atmosphere;\n            Surface = surface;\n            Chemicals = chemicals;\n        }\n\n        public void DisplayInfo()\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Planet Name: {Name}\");\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Size: {Size}\");\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Atmosphere: {Atmosphere}\");\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Surface: {Surface}\");\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Chemical Composition: \" + string.Join(\", \", Chemicals));\n            Console.WriteLine();\n        }\n    }\n\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            // Creating a list of planets\n            List<Planet> planets = new List<Planet>\n            {\n                new Planet(\"Trantor\", PlanetSize.Large, AtmosphereType.Dense, SurfaceComposition.Metallic,\n                    new List<ChemicalComposition> { ChemicalComposition.OxygenRich, ChemicalComposition.CarbonDioxideRich }),\n\n                new Planet(\"Terminus\", PlanetSize.Medium, AtmosphereType.Thin, SurfaceComposition.Rocky,\n                    new List<ChemicalComposition> { ChemicalComposition.MethaneRich }),\n\n                new Planet(\"Helicon\", PlanetSize.Small, AtmosphereType.None, SurfaceComposition.Rocky,\n                    new List<ChemicalComposition> { ChemicalComposition.HydrogenRich })\n            };\n\n            // Displaying information about each planet\n            foreach (var planet in planets)\n            {\n                planet.DisplayInfo();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Enums**: Used to define categories such as `PlanetSize`, `AtmosphereType`, `SurfaceComposition`, and `ChemicalComposition`. Enums provide a clear and structured way to handle predefined categories.\n\n2. **Planet Class**: Represents a planet and includes properties for name, size, atmosphere, surface type, and chemical composition. The `DisplayInfo` method prints out the planet's details.\n\n3. **Main Program**: A list of planets is created, each initialized with specific values for each property. The `DisplayInfo` method is called to output the details of each planet.\n\nThis code can be expanded to include more specific subcategories or additional properties as needed. You can also implement methods for in-depth analysis, such as filtering planets based on certain criteria or comparing properties between planets."
