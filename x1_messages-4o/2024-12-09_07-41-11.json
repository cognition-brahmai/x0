In the example given, I have a pandas DataFrame with a column \"col_1\" and I would like to remove values such as 2065, 2067 and 1569, which occur only once. How can I perform this operation for all columns that have a similar distribution of values?"

        "content": "To remove low frequency values from all columns in a pandas DataFrame, you can use the `value_counts` method along with boolean indexing. Below is a step-by-step guide to achieve this for all columns in the DataFrame:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Example DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'col_1': [2065, 2067, 1569, 2065, 2065, 1569, 2070],\n    'col_2': [1001, 1002, 1001, 1003, 1002, 1002, 1004],\n    'col_3': [3001, 3002, 3001, 3003, 3002, 3004, 3001]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Function to remove low frequency values from a column\ndef remove_low_frequency(series, threshold=1):\n    # Get the frequency of each value\n    freq = series.value_counts()\n    # Filter out values that occur less than or equal to the threshold\n    values_to_keep = freq[freq > threshold].index\n    # Return the series with only the frequent values\n    return series.where(series.isin(values_to_keep))\n\n# Apply the function to all columns\ndf_cleaned = df.apply(remove_low_frequency)\n\nprint(df_cleaned)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `remove_low_frequency` function calculates the frequency of each value in a column using `value_counts()`. It then filters out values that occur less than or equal to the specified threshold (default is 1, meaning values that occur only once will be removed). The function is applied to each column using `apply()`.\n\nThe resulting `df_cleaned` DataFrame will have the infrequent values removed from each column, replacing them with `NaN` where they were removed. You can adjust the `threshold` parameter if you want to keep values that occur more frequently than once."
