Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nnumbers = list(range(1, 50))\n\nfor i in numbers:\n    if i < 20:\n        numbers.remove(i)\n\nprint(numbers)\n```\n\nBut when I print the list, I'm finding numbers that are less than 20 still present. The output I'm getting is:\n\n```python\n[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49]\n```\n\nI was expecting all numbers below 20 to be removed from the list. It seems that there is something wrong with the remove method. Can you help me understand and solve this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to modifying the list while iterating over it, which can lead to unexpected behavior. When you remove an item from the list, the indices of subsequent elements are shifted, and this can cause the loop to skip elements.\n\nA better approach is to create a new list that contains only the numbers you want to keep. Here\u2019s how you could do it:\n\n```python\nnumbers = list(range(1, 50))\n\n# Create a new list with numbers that are 20 or greater\nfiltered_numbers = [i for i in numbers if i >= 20]\n\nprint(filtered_numbers)\n```\n\nThis code uses a list comprehension to filter out the numbers less than 20, resulting in a new list of numbers that are 20 or greater. This way, you're not modifying the list while iterating over it, avoiding the issue you encountered."
