I've tried various methods such as using 'pd.notnull()', 'drop()', 'dropna()' and comparing to 'null', but nothing seems to work. I also know the date of the row I want to drop but I'm unable to do so. Can someone guide me on how to drop a row based on a null value in a column as well as how to drop a row based on the date? Here is the code I have tried so far:\n\n```python\ndf1 = ut.get_data(symbols, dates) # column heads are 'SPY', 'BBD'\n\ndf1 = pd.notnull(df1['BBD']) # drops rows with null val, not working\ndf1 = df1.drop(2010-05-04, axis=0)\ndf1 = df1[df1.'BBD' != null]\ndf1 = df1.dropna(subset=['BBD'])\ndf1 = pd.notnull(df1.BBD)\n\ndf1.drop([2015-10-30])\ndf1.drop(['2015-10-30'])\ndf1.drop([2015-10-30], axis=0)\ndf1.drop(['2015-10-30'], axis=0)\n\nwith pd.option_context('display.max_row', None):\n    print(df1)\n```"

        "content": "To address your issue with dropping rows based on null values and specific dates in a pandas DataFrame, let's go through the steps one by one.\n\n### Dropping Rows with Null Values in a Specific Column\n\nIf you want to remove rows where a specific column, such as `'BBD'`, contains null (NaN) values, you can use the `dropna()` method correctly as follows:\n\n```python\n# Remove rows where 'BBD' column has NaN values\ndf1 = df1.dropna(subset=['BBD'])\n```\n\nThis line of code should work if there are indeed NaN values in the `'BBD'` column. Ensure that your DataFrame `df1` is correctly loaded and that the column `'BBD'` exists.\n\n### Dropping a Row Based on a Specific Date\n\nIf you want to drop a row based on a specific date, ensure that your DataFrame's index is of datetime type. If not, you may need to convert it first. Here's how you can drop a row by date:\n\n1. **Ensure the Index is DateTime:**\n\n   ```python\n   # Convert index to datetime if it's not already\n   df1.index = pd.to_datetime(df1.index)\n   ```\n\n2. **Drop the Row by Specific Date:**\n\n   ```python\n   # Drop the row by date\n   df1 = df1.drop(pd.to_datetime('2010-05-04'))\n   ```\n\nMake sure you are using the correct date format and that the date exists in your DataFrame index.\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- Ensure that your DataFrame `df1` is correctly initialized and loaded with data.\n- Verify that the column names and date formats match what you have in your DataFrame.\n- When specifying dates, ensure you are using strings in the correct format for `pd.to_datetime()`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to remove rows with null values in a specific column and drop rows based on a specific date. If you encounter any errors, make sure to check the DataFrame structure and contents using `df1.info()` and `df1.head()` to understand the current state of your data."
