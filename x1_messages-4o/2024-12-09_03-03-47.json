I have tried using the `sort` function followed by a `groupby` and `head` function, which seems to work, but I am unsure if this is the correct approach, especially when working with a large dataset. Is there a better way to achieve this? Here is the code I attempted:\n\n```python\ndf.sort(['pidx','score'],ascending = False).groupby('pidx').head(2) \n```"

        "content": "Your approach is mostly correct, but there are a few improvements you can make to ensure clarity and compatibility with the latest pandas versions. Here's a refined version of your code:\n\n```python\ndf = df.sort_values(['pidx', 'score'], ascending=[True, False])\ntop_2_per_group = df.groupby('pidx').head(2)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`sort_values()` instead of `sort()`**: The `sort()` function is not available for DataFrames. You should use `sort_values()` to sort the DataFrame. This function is specifically designed for sorting DataFrames in pandas.\n\n2. **`ascending=[True, False]`**: This explicitly sets the sort order for each column. We want to sort `pidx` in ascending order and `score` in descending order. \n\n3. **Grouping and Selecting Top Rows**: After sorting the DataFrame, you use `groupby('pidx')` and then `head(2)` to select the top 2 rows in each group based on the sorted order.\n\nThis approach should be efficient for large datasets as well, but always consider the memory constraints of your environment, especially if the DataFrame is very large. If you face performance issues, ensure that your DataFrame is optimized (e.g., correct data types, no unnecessary columns) and consider working with a subset of the data if possible."
