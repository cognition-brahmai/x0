I am trying to check if a specific field is not equal to any of several different characters. Can I use multiple 'or' conditions in a single 'if' statement in Python? For example, can I write `if fields[9] != ('A' or 'D' or 'E' or 'N' or 'R'):` instead of `if fields[9] != 'A' and fields[9] != 'D' and fields[9] != 'E' and fields[9] != 'N' and fields[9] != 'R':`?"

        "content": "In Python, the expression `('A' or 'D' or 'E' or 'N' or 'R')` does not work in the way you might expect. This expression will evaluate to `'A'` because of how Python's `or` operator works. The `or` operator returns the first truthy value it encounters, and since strings are truthy if they are not empty, it simply returns `'A'`.\n\nTo check if a specific field is not equal to any of several different characters, you should use the `not in` operator with a tuple or list. Here\u2019s how you can rewrite your condition:\n\n```python\nif fields[9] not in ('A', 'D', 'E', 'N', 'R'):\n```\n\nThis statement checks if `fields[9]` is not one of the characters in the tuple. If it isn't, the condition evaluates to `True`. This is a more concise and idiomatic way to express your intent in Python."
