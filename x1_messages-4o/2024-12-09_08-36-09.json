For instance, consider the following class code:\n\n```python\nclass TestSomething(object):\n\n    def setup(self):\n        test_name = ...\n\n    def teardown(self):\n        pass\n\n    def test_the_power(self):\n        assert \"foo\" != \"bar\"\n\n    def test_something_else(self):\n        assert True\n```\n\nIn this case, just before TestSomething.test_the_power is executed, I want to access this name in setup as indicated in the code via `test_name = ...` so that `test_name` equals `TestSomething.test_the_power`. I am using setup to allocate resources for each test and I want to know which resource was created by which test. Is there a way to do this?"

        "content": "In `pytest`, you can achieve the desired functionality using fixtures. Fixtures are a more powerful and flexible way to manage setup and teardown in `pytest`. They allow you to access information about the test currently being executed, including the test name. Here\u2019s how you can modify your code to use a fixture and capture the test name:\n\n```python\nimport pytest\n\n@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)\ndef setup_and_teardown(request):\n    test_name = request.node.name\n    # Setup code here, using test_name if needed\n    print(f\"Setting up for {test_name}\")\n\n    yield  # This is where the test will run\n\n    # Teardown code here\n    print(f\"Tearing down for {test_name}\")\n\nclass TestSomething:\n\n    def test_the_power(self):\n        assert \"foo\" != \"bar\"\n\n    def test_something_else(self):\n        assert True\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Fixture with `autouse=True`:** The fixture `setup_and_teardown` is automatically used for each test. This means you don't have to explicitly include it in each test function.\n- **Accessing the Test Name:** The `request` fixture provides a `request` object that contains information about the test function currently being executed. `request.node.name` gives you the name of the test function, including the class name if applicable.\n- **Setup and Teardown:** The code before `yield` is executed before the test (setup), and the code after `yield` is executed after the test (teardown).\n\nThis setup allows you to print or log the test name during setup and teardown, which can help in managing resources specific to each test."
