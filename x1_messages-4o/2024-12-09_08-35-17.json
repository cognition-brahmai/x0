I have a JSON file with data structured like this: {\"key1\": {\"key1A\": [\"value1\", \"value2\"], \"key1B\": {\"key1B1\": \"value3\"}}}. How can I add a new key-value pair, specifically \"ADDED_KEY\": \"ADDED_VALUE\", to this existing JSON data in Python? I've started with the following code but I'm unsure how to proceed:\n\n```\nimport json\n\njson_data = open(json_file)\njson_decoded = json.load(json_data)\n\n# What I have to make here?!\n\njson_data.close()\n```"

        "content": "To add a new key-value pair to your existing JSON data in Python, you need to modify the Python dictionary that represents your JSON data. Here's how you can add the key \"ADDED_KEY\" with the value \"ADDED_VALUE\" to your JSON structure:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Load the JSON data from a file\nwith open('your_json_file.json', 'r') as json_file:\n    json_decoded = json.load(json_file)\n\n# Add the new key-value pair to the top level of the JSON structure\njson_decoded[\"ADDED_KEY\"] = \"ADDED_VALUE\"\n\n# Optionally, if you want to insert the key-value pair to a specific sub-dictionary,\n# for example, under \"key1B\", you can do this:\n# json_decoded[\"key1\"][\"key1B\"][\"ADDED_KEY\"] = \"ADDED_VALUE\"\n\n# Write the updated JSON data back to the file\nwith open('your_json_file.json', 'w') as json_file:\n    json.dump(json_decoded, json_file, indent=4)\n\nprint(json_decoded)  # To verify the changes\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Loading JSON Data**: We open the JSON file and load its contents into a Python dictionary using `json.load()`.\n\n2. **Adding the Key-Value Pair**: You can directly add a new key-value pair to the dictionary. If you want to add it to a specific sub-dictionary, you can dive deeper into the structure as shown in the commented line.\n\n3. **Saving the Changes**: After modifying the dictionary, you write the updated dictionary back to the file using `json.dump()`. The `indent=4` parameter is optional but makes the JSON file more readable by formatting it with indentation.\n\nEnsure that your file paths are correctly set, and you have the necessary permissions to read and write to the file."
