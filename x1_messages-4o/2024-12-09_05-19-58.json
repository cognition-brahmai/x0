        "content": "The error message you're encountering indicates two main issues. Let's address them one by one:\n\n1. **Warning about `settings.DEBUG`:**\n   - The warning about `settings.DEBUG` is a reminder that using Django's `DEBUG` setting in production can lead to a memory leak. This warning is a general caution and doesn't affect development environments. However, make sure to set `DEBUG = False` in your production settings to avoid potential issues.\n\n2. **Connection Refused to RabbitMQ (AMQP):**\n   - The error `[Errno 61] Connection refused` indicates that the Celery worker is unable to connect to the RabbitMQ server. This could be due to several reasons:\n     - **RabbitMQ Server is not running:** Make sure that RabbitMQ is installed and the server is running. You can start the RabbitMQ server with the command `rabbitmq-server` or `sudo service rabbitmq-server start` depending on your operating system.\n     - **Incorrect broker URL:** Double-check the `BROKER_URL` in your settings to ensure it matches the RabbitMQ server's configuration. The default guest credentials (`guest:guest`) only work when connecting from `localhost`.\n     - **Firewall or Network issues:** Ensure there are no firewall rules blocking the connection to RabbitMQ on port 5672.\n\nHere are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the connection issue:\n\n- **Check RabbitMQ Status:**\n  ```bash\n  sudo rabbitmqctl status\n  ```\n  This command will help you verify if RabbitMQ is running. If not, start the service.\n\n- **Verify RabbitMQ Logs:**\n  Check RabbitMQ logs for any errors or issues that might provide more context about why the connection is refused. Logs are typically found in `/var/log/rabbitmq/` or `/usr/local/var/log/rabbitmq/`.\n\n- **Restart RabbitMQ:**\n  If RabbitMQ is running but the issue persists, try restarting the RabbitMQ service:\n  ```bash\n  sudo service rabbitmq-server restart\n  ```\n\n- **Check for Port Conflicts:**\n  Ensure that no other services are using port 5672, which RabbitMQ typically uses.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and get your Celery workers connected to the RabbitMQ broker. If the problem persists, consider checking the RabbitMQ documentation for additional troubleshooting tips."
