        "content": "To set an update rule for the learning rate or apply a decay value to the `GradientDescentOptimizer` in TensorFlow, you can use a learning rate schedule. This allows the learning rate to change over time, typically decreasing as training progresses. TensorFlow provides several predefined learning rate schedules, such as exponential decay, polynomial decay, or a custom schedule you can define yourself.\n\nHere's an example of how to implement exponential decay for the learning rate in your existing setup:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Define the global step, which is used in the learning rate decay calculation\nglobal_step = tf.Variable(0, trainable=False, name='global_step')\n\n# Define the initial learning rate\ninitial_learning_rate = 0.3\n\n# Define the learning rate decay parameters\ndecay_steps = 1000  # Decay the learning rate every 1000 steps\ndecay_rate = 0.96   # The learning rate will decay by this factor\nstaircase = True    # If True, the learning rate decays in a discrete staircase fashion\n\n# Apply exponential decay to the learning rate\nlearning_rate = tf.train.exponential_decay(initial_learning_rate,\n                                           global_step,\n                                           decay_steps,\n                                           decay_rate,\n                                           staircase=staircase)\n\n# Initialize variables\ninit = tf.global_variables_initializer()\nsess = tf.Session()\nsess.run(init)\n\n# Define the mean squared error\nmse = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(out - out_))\n\n# Use the decayed learning rate in the optimizer\ntrain_step = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate).minimize(mse, global_step=global_step)\n\n# Training loop\nfor step in range(num_steps):\n    sess.run(train_step, feed_dict={...})\n    if step % display_step == 0:\n        current_learning_rate = sess.run(learning_rate)\n        print(f\"Step {step}, Learning Rate: {current_learning_rate}\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Global Step**: This is a variable that keeps track of the number of training steps. It is used to compute the learning rate decay.\n- **Exponential Decay**: The learning rate decreases exponentially with each step.\n- **Staircase**: If `True`, the learning rate is decayed using a staircase function.\n\nThis setup allows you to dynamically adjust the learning rate as training progresses, which can improve convergence and training efficiency. You can adjust the `decay_steps`, `decay_rate`, and whether you want a `staircase` effect to fit your specific model and dataset."
