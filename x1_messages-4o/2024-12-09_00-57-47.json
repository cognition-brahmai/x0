I've been trying to understand absolute imports in Python and have created a directory structure with `pkg/__init__.py, pkg/main.py, and pkg/string.py`. When I use the command `import string` in `main.py` and try to print `string.ascii_uppercase`, it results in an `AttributeError`. The Python 2.5 changelog suggests that using `from __future__ import absolute_import` should make `import string` find the standard library's version. But when I add this directive to a new file `main2.py` and execute it, it again results in an `AttributeError`. This issue persists even when using Python 2.7 and Python 3.5. Can you explain why this is happening and how to resolve it?"

        "content": "The directive `from __future__ import absolute_import` is used in Python 2.x to change the import behavior to be more consistent with Python 3.x, where all imports are absolute by default. This means that when you import a module, Python will not automatically look in the local package first before checking the standard library and other installed packages.\n\nIn your case, the issue arises because of the name conflict between your local module `pkg/string.py` and Python\u2019s standard library `string` module. When you run `import string` inside `pkg/main.py` without the `from __future__ import absolute_import` directive, Python 2.x will first look for a module named `string` in the current package `pkg`. Since it finds `pkg/string.py`, it imports that instead of the standard library's `string` module, which is why you get an `AttributeError` when trying to access `string.ascii_uppercase`, as your local `pkg/string.py` likely doesn't define `ascii_uppercase`.\n\nThe directive `from __future__ import absolute_import` changes this behavior so that `import string` will always refer to the standard library's `string` module unless you explicitly specify a relative import. However, if your `pkg/main2.py` still results in an `AttributeError` after adding the directive, it could be because the directive is not being executed properly or there are other issues in your setup or code.\n\nTo resolve the issue, you can do the following:\n\n1. **Ensure the Directive is at the Top:**\n   Make sure `from __future__ import absolute_import` is at the very top of your `main2.py` file, before any other imports.\n\n2. **Use Explicit Relative Imports:**\n   If you need to import your local `string.py`, use explicit relative imports. For example:\n   ```python\n   from . import string  # Imports pkg/string.py\n   ```\n\n3. **Rename Local Modules:**\n   To avoid conflicts, consider renaming your local `string.py` module to something else that doesn\u2019t clash with standard library module names.\n\n4. **Double-check Python Version:**\n   Make sure you are indeed running the code with Python 2.x, as the behavior in Python 3.x should already default to absolute imports.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to resolve the import conflict and access the standard library's `string` module correctly."
