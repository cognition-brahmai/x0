I've created a custom registration form and added it to urls.py, following a tutorial. I've overridden the default registration form to create the profile simultaneously. However, while the form is displayed and I can enter in the City, it does not save or create the entry in the database. How can I solve this?"

        "content": "To solve the issue of not saving or creating the user profile entry in the database during registration, you need to ensure that the profile is being created and saved correctly when the registration form is submitted. Here are the steps you can follow to achieve this:\n\n1. **Custom Registration Form**: Make sure your custom registration form is correctly set up to include additional fields, such as 'City'. This form should inherit from the default registration form provided by `django-registration`.\n\n2. **Signal Handling**: A common approach to create a user profile upon registration is to use Django's signals. Specifically, you can use the `post_save` signal to create a profile whenever a new user is created.\n\n3. **Create a Profile Model**: Ensure you have a `Profile` model that has a OneToOne relationship with the `User` model. This model should have fields like 'City' that you want to save.\n\n4. **Signal Implementation**:\n   - Connect a signal receiver function to the `post_save` signal of the User model. This function should create a Profile instance whenever a new User instance is created.\n\nHere is an example implementation:\n\nFirst, make sure you have a Profile model like this:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User\n\nclass Profile(models.Model):\n    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n    city = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return self.user.username\n```\n\nThen, create a signal receiver function in your `signals.py` or `models.py`:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db.models.signals import post_save\nfrom django.dispatch import receiver\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User\nfrom .models import Profile\n\n@receiver(post_save, sender=User)\ndef create_user_profile(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):\n    if created:\n        Profile.objects.create(user=instance)\n\n@receiver(post_save, sender=User)\ndef save_user_profile(sender, instance, **kwargs):\n    instance.profile.save()\n```\n\nFinally, ensure that your app is ready to use signals by importing the signal handlers. You can do this in the `apps.py` of your Django app:\n\n```python\nfrom django.apps import AppConfig\n\nclass YourAppNameConfig(AppConfig):\n    name = 'your_app_name'\n\n    def ready(self):\n        import your_app_name.signals  # Import the signals module\n```\n\nAnd don't forget to add your app configuration to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:\n\n```python\nINSTALLED_APPS = [\n    # other apps\n    'your_app_name.apps.YourAppNameConfig',\n]\n```\n\n5. **Custom Save Method in Form**: If you're using a custom form, override the `save` method to handle additional data:\n\n```python\nfrom django import forms\nfrom django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User\nfrom .models import Profile\n\nclass CustomRegistrationForm(UserCreationForm):\n    city = forms.CharField(max_length=100, required=True)\n\n    class Meta:\n        model = User\n        fields = ('username', 'password1', 'password2', 'city')\n\n    def save(self, commit=True):\n        user = super().save(commit=False)\n        if commit:\n            user.save()\n            Profile.objects.create(user=user, city=self.cleaned_data['city'])\n        return user\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to ensure that a user profile is created and saved alongside the user during the registration process."
