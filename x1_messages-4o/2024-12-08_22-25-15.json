        "content": "To calculate the total number of hours required to learn and review the list of Mandarin Chinese words, you can use the provided Ruby code. Let's go through the code step by step:\n\n1. **Initialize Variables:**\n   - `days = 30`: You have 30 days to study.\n   - `hours_per_day = 8`: You spend 8 hours each day (6 hours studying and 2 hours reviewing).\n   - `words_to_learn = 500`: Total words you need to learn.\n   - `new_words_per_day = 10`: Number of new words you learn each day.\n   - `old_words_per_day = 50`: Number of old words you review each day.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Words:**\n   - `total_new_words = new_words_per_day * days`: Total new words you will learn in 30 days.\n   - `total_old_words = old_words_per_day * days`: Total old words you will review in 30 days.\n   - `total_words = total_new_words + total_old_words`: Total words you will study and review.\n\n3. **Calculate Hours Per Word:**\n   - `total_hours_per_word = hours_per_day.to_f / (new_words_per_day + old_words_per_day)`: Average hours spent per word each day.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Hours:**\n   - `total_hours = total_words * total_hours_per_word`: Total hours spent studying and reviewing.\n\n5. **Output the Result:**\n   - `puts \"You will spend #{total_hours} hours studying and reviewing Mandarin Chinese within 30 days.\"`\n\nNow, let's break down the calculations using the given code:\n\n```ruby\ndays = 30\nhours_per_day = 8\nwords_to_learn = 500\nnew_words_per_day = 10\nold_words_per_day = 50\n\ntotal_new_words = new_words_per_day * days\ntotal_old_words = old_words_per_day * days\ntotal_words = total_new_words + total_old_words\ntotal_hours_per_word = hours_per_day.to_f / (new_words_per_day + old_words_per_day)\ntotal_hours = total_words * total_hours_per_word\n\nputs \"You will spend #{total_hours} hours studying and reviewing Mandarin Chinese within 30 days.\"\n```\n\n- `total_new_words = 10 * 30 = 300`\n- `total_old_words = 50 * 30 = 1500`\n- `total_words = 300 + 1500 = 1800`\n\n- `total_hours_per_word = 8 / (10 + 50) = 8 / 60 = 0.1333 (approx)`\n\n- `total_hours = 1800 * 0.1333 \u2248 239.94`\n\nTherefore, you will spend approximately 240 hours studying and reviewing Mandarin Chinese within 30 days."
