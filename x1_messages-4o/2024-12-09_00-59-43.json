        "content": "To detect if a given string in Python contains either numbers or letters, you can utilize various methods, including functions that take advantage of ASCII codes. Here's a step-by-step approach using both built-in string methods and ASCII checks:\n\n### Using Built-in String Methods\n\n1. **Checking for Letters:**\n\n   You can use the `str.isalpha()` method to check if a string contains only letters. If you want to check each character individually and see if there is at least one letter, you can use a loop or a comprehension.\n\n   ```python\n   def contains_letters(s):\n       return any(char.isalpha() for char in s)\n   ```\n\n2. **Checking for Numbers:**\n\n   You can use the `str.isdigit()` method to check if a string contains only numbers. Similarly, to check for the presence of any numbers, use a loop or comprehension.\n\n   ```python\n   def contains_numbers(s):\n       return any(char.isdigit() for char in s)\n   ```\n\n### Using ASCII Codes\n\nYou can also check if a character is a letter or a number by evaluating its ASCII code:\n\n1. **Checking for Letters:**\n\n   Letters in the ASCII table are within the ranges 65-90 for uppercase (A-Z) and 97-122 for lowercase (a-z).\n\n   ```python\n   def contains_letters_ascii(s):\n       return any(65 <= ord(char) <= 90 or 97 <= ord(char) <= 122 for char in s)\n   ```\n\n2. **Checking for Numbers:**\n\n   Numbers in the ASCII table are within the range 48-57 (0-9).\n\n   ```python\n   def contains_numbers_ascii(s):\n       return any(48 <= ord(char) <= 57 for char in s)\n   ```\n\n### Combined Function\n\nHere's a combined function that uses ASCII codes to detect both letters and numbers:\n\n```python\ndef contains_letters_or_numbers(s):\n    has_letters = any(65 <= ord(char) <= 90 or 97 <= ord(char) <= 122 for char in s)\n    has_numbers = any(48 <= ord(char) <= 57 for char in s)\n    return has_letters, has_numbers\n\n# Example usage\nstring = \"Hello123\"\nletters, numbers = contains_letters_or_numbers(string)\nprint(f\"Contains letters: {letters}, Contains numbers: {numbers}\")\n```\n\nThis code will check the presence of both letters and numbers in the given string and print the results."
