I need to go through a proxy server to access the internet and my proxy server requires authentication. I have written some code that works well when the proxy server requires basic authentication. However, I'm having trouble figuring out what to do when the proxy server requires digest authentication. The HTTPProxyAuth doesn't seem to work in this case (r.status_code returns 407). Here's the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom requests.auth import HTTPProxyAuth\n\nproxies = {\"http\":\"192.168.20.130:8080\"}\nauth = HTTPProxyAuth(\"username\", \"password\")\n\nr = requests.get(\"http://www.google.co.jp/\", proxies=proxies, auth=auth)\n```\n\nCould you help me modify this code to handle digest authentication?"

        "content": "To handle digest authentication with a proxy in Python's `requests` module, you'll need to use a different approach since `HTTPProxyAuth` only supports basic authentication. Unfortunately, the `requests` library does not natively support digest authentication for proxies out of the box, but you can work around this limitation using the `requests.auth.HTTPDigestAuth` for the proxy authentication. Here's an example of how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom requests.auth import HTTPDigestAuth\n\n# Define the proxy and credentials\nproxy = {\n    \"http\": \"http://192.168.20.130:8080\",\n    \"https\": \"http://192.168.20.130:8080\"\n}\n\n# Create a session\nsession = requests.Session()\n\n# Set the proxy and authentication handler for the session\nsession.proxies.update(proxy)\nsession.auth = HTTPDigestAuth('username', 'password')\n\n# Make a request\ntry:\n    response = session.get(\"http://www.google.co.jp/\")\n    print(response.status_code)\n    print(response.text)\nexcept requests.exceptions.ProxyError as e:\n    print(f\"Proxy error: {e}\")\nexcept requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n    print(f\"Request error: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Session Management**: We use a `session` object which allows us to persist parameters across requests. This is useful for keeping things like authentication details.\n- **HTTPDigestAuth**: We use this for handling digest authentication.\n- **Proxy Configuration**: The session is configured to use the specified proxy for both HTTP and HTTPS requests.\n- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling to catch and print any exceptions related to proxy errors or general request failures.\n\nThis setup should help you handle digest authentication with a proxy server using Python's `requests` library.
