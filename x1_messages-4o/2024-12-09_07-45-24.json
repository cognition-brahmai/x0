I am confident with writing docstrings for functions and classes, but I'm unsure about the content that should be included in a module docstring. I understand at a minimum, it should document the functions and classes that the module exports. However, I've seen modules that include additional information such as author names, copyright details etc. Can anyone provide an example or structure of how a good Python module docstring should be written?"

        "content": "Certainly! A well-written module docstring serves as an introduction to the module, providing all the necessary information to understand its purpose and usage. While there's no strict rule on what must be included, a good module docstring typically contains the following elements:\n\n1. **Summary**: A brief overview of what the module does.\n2. **Purpose**: A more detailed explanation of the module's functionality and why it's useful.\n3. **Contents**: A list or brief description of the main classes, functions, or exceptions that the module exports.\n4. **Usage**: Optional examples of how to use the module.\n5. **Author(s)**: The name(s) of the individual(s) who wrote or maintain the module.\n6. **Copyright**: Any relevant copyright information or licensing terms.\n7. **Version**: The current version of the module, if applicable.\n8. **Additional Notes**: Any additional information or references to related modules or documentation.\n\nHere's an example of a well-structured module docstring:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nmodule_name.py\n\nThis module provides utilities for data processing and analysis.\n\nThe module includes functions for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing datasets.\nIt is designed to work seamlessly with pandas DataFrames and provides additional\nfeatures for handling missing data and outliers.\n\nContents:\n- clean_data(df): Cleans the input DataFrame by removing or filling missing values.\n- transform_data(df): Applies transformations to the DataFrame for better analysis.\n- analyze_data(df): Performs basic statistical analysis on the provided DataFrame.\n\nExample Usage:\n>>> import module_name\n>>> df_cleaned = module_name.clean_data(df)\n>>> df_transformed = module_name.transform_data(df_cleaned)\n>>> result = module_name.analyze_data(df_transformed)\n\nAuthor:\nJohn Doe <john.doe@example.com>\n\nCopyright (c) 2023 John Doe\n\nVersion:\n1.0.0\n\nNotes:\nThis module requires pandas version 1.2 or above. For more information on data\nprocessing, refer to the official pandas documentation.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Module code goes here\n```\n\nThis structure helps users understand the purpose and functionality of the module quickly and efficiently. Adjust the content based on the specific needs and context of your module."
