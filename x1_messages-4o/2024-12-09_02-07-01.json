I am interested in extracting the two timestamp parts that come after the second underscore '_' and before the '.txt'. I have attempted to do this using the Python regex string split function as follows: `time_info = re.split('^[0-9]+_[LU]_|-|\\.txt$', f)`. However, this is returning two extra empty strings in the list: `time_info=['', '20111007T084734', '20111008T023142', '']`. I only want the timestamp information, so how can I achieve a result like this: `time_info=['20111007T084734', '20111008T023142']`?"

        "content": "To extract the two timestamp parts from the file names without any extra empty strings, you can modify your approach to use capturing groups in the regular expression. Instead of splitting, you can use the `re.findall()` function to directly extract the desired parts.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nfilename = '000014_L_20111007T084734-20111008T023142.txt'\n# Use re.findall to capture the two timestamp parts\ntime_info = re.findall(r'_(\\d{8}T\\d{6})-(\\d{8}T\\d{6})\\.txt$', filename)\n\n# Since re.findall returns a list of tuples, we need to flatten it\ntime_info = list(time_info[0])\n\nprint(time_info)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The regular expression `_(\\d{8}T\\d{6})-(\\d{8}T\\d{6})\\.txt$` is used to capture the timestamps:\n  - `_(\\d{8}T\\d{6})` captures the first timestamp part, `_` ensures it starts right after the underscore.\n  - `-(\\d{8}T\\d{6})` captures the second timestamp part, `-` ensures it starts right after the hyphen.\n  - `\\.txt$` ensures the string ends with `.txt`.\n- `re.findall()` returns a list of tuples containing the matched groups. Since there is only one match, we access the first element and convert it to a list.\n\nThis will give you `['20111007T084734', '20111008T023142']` as the output, without any extra empty strings."
