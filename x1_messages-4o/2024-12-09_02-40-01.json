Here's an example of the routes I'm working with:\n\n```python\n@app.route(\"/antitop/\")\n@app.route(\"/top/\")\n@requires_auth\ndef show_top():\n    ....\n```\nHow can I identify if the route was called using `/top/` or `/antitop/`? I am aware of `request.path` but I prefer not to use it due to the potential complexity of the request. I believe using `url_rule` might be the best solution, but I'm not sure how to implement it."

        "content": "In Flask, when you have multiple routes pointing to the same function, you can determine which route was used by accessing the `request` object. While you've mentioned that you prefer not to use `request.path`, it's actually one of the most straightforward ways to identify the route. However, if you want to avoid directly using `request.path`, you can indeed use `request.url_rule`, which represents the matched URL rule for the current request.\n\nHere's how you can use `request.url_rule` to determine which route was used:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\ndef requires_auth(f):\n    # Dummy decorator for illustration\n    def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):\n        return f(*args, **kwargs)\n    return decorated_function\n\n@app.route(\"/antitop/\")\n@app.route(\"/top/\")\n@requires_auth\ndef show_top():\n    # Get the URL rule that matched the request\n    rule = request.url_rule\n    # Convert the rule to a string to compare\n    if str(rule) == \"/top/\":\n        return \"You accessed via /top/\"\n    elif str(rule) == \"/antitop/\":\n        return \"You accessed via /antitop/\"\n    else:\n        return \"Unknown route\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\nIn this example, `request.url_rule` gives you the matched URL rule as a `werkzeug.routing.Rule` object, which you can convert to a string to check against your defined routes. This way, you avoid directly using `request.path` while still determining which route was used."
