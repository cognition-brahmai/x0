        "content": "I am trying to use the new boto3 client for AWS and I have a simple use-case: get an object from S3 and save it to a file. Previously, with boto 2.X, I would do it with the following code:\n\n```python\nimport boto\nkey = boto.connect_s3().get_bucket('foo').get_key('foo')\nkey.get_contents_to_filename('/tmp/foo')\n```\n\nHowever, with boto3, I can't find a straightforward way to perform the same operation. Instead, I'm manually iterating over the \"Streaming\" object like this:\n\n```python\nimport boto3\nkey = boto3.resource('s3').Object('fooo', 'docker/my-image.tar.gz').get()\nwith open('/tmp/my-image.tar.gz', 'w') as f:\n    chunk = key['Body'].read(1024*8)\n    while chunk:\n        f.write(chunk)\n        chunk = key['Body'].read(1024*8)\n```\n\nor\n\n```python\nimport boto3\nkey = boto3.resource('s3').Object('fooo', 'docker/my-image.tar.gz').get()\nwith open('/tmp/my-image.tar.gz', 'w') as f:\n    for chunk in iter(lambda: key['Body'].read(4096), b''):\n        f.write(chunk)\n```\n\nThese solutions work, but I was wondering if there is a more \"native\" boto3 function that can perform this task?"

        "content": "Yes, boto3 provides a more straightforward way to download an S3 object to a file without manually iterating over the object's body. You can use the `download_file` method from the S3 `Client` or `Resource` API. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Using the S3 Client\n\n```python\nimport boto3\n\ns3_client = boto3.client('s3')\ns3_client.download_file('fooo', 'docker/my-image.tar.gz', '/tmp/my-image.tar.gz')\n```\n\n### Using the S3 Resource\n\n```python\nimport boto3\n\ns3 = boto3.resource('s3')\ns3.Bucket('fooo').download_file('docker/my-image.tar.gz', '/tmp/my-image.tar.gz')\n```\n\nThese methods are more efficient and easier to use than manually reading and writing the file. The `download_file` method handles the streaming and writing process internally, making your code cleaner and more concise."
