        "content": "To subtract the mean from each group and normalize the data per column within each group, you can use the `transform` method in combination with `groupby`. This method will allow you to apply a function to each group and return a dataframe of the same size as the original, making it easy to perform operations like subtracting the mean. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Your existing code to generate the dataset\nN = 20\nm = 3\ndata = np.random.normal(size=(N, m)) + np.random.normal(size=(N, m))**3\nindx = np.random.randint(0, 3, size=N).astype(np.int32)\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(np.hstack((data, indx[:, None])), \n                  columns=['a%s' % k for k in range(m)] + ['indx'])\n\n# Calculate the mean per group for each column and subtract it\nnormalized_df = df.copy()\nnormalized_df[['a%s' % k for k in range(m)]] = df.groupby('indx')[['a%s' % k for k in range(m)]].transform(lambda x: x - x.mean())\n\nprint(normalized_df)\n```\n\nThis code does the following:\n\n1. It groups the dataframe `df` by the 'indx' column using `groupby('indx')`.\n2. It applies the `transform` function to each group. The function (`lambda x: x - x.mean()`) calculates the mean for each group and subtracts it from each element in the group.\n3. The result is a new dataframe `normalized_df` where each column `a0`, `a1`, `a2` is normalized by subtracting the mean of its respective group.\n\nThe transformed dataframe will have the same shape as the original dataframe, with the 'indx' column remaining unchanged."
