Can you provide an example code snippet using [array data] and [C++ code] formats to demonstrate your implementation? \nTo get started, consider using an array of integers sorted in ascending order as input data. Then, implement a recursive function to perform the binary search algorithm. The function should take in the array, the lower and upper bounds of the search range, and the target value as parameters. \nHere's an example of a binary search implementation using C++ code and an input array:\n[Array data]\n[3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 15, 18, 20, 25]\n[C++ code]\nint binarySearch(int arr[], int low, int high, int target) {\n  if (high >= low) {\n    int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;\n    if (arr[mid] == target)\n      return mid;\n    if (arr[mid] > target)\n      return binarySearch(arr, low, mid - 1, target);\n    return binarySearch(arr, mid + 1, high, target);\n  }\n  return -1;\n}\nint main() {\n  int arr[] = {3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 15, 18, 20, 25};\n  int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);\n  int target = 18;\n  int result = binarySearch(arr, 0, n - 1, target);\n  (result == -1) ? cout << \"Element is not present in array\"\n                 : cout << \"Element is present at index \" << result;\n  return 0;\n}\nHow can you modify this code to handle arrays with duplicate values and return the index of the first occurrence of the target value?"

        "content": "To modify the binary search algorithm to handle arrays with duplicate values and return the index of the first occurrence of the target value, you can adjust the recursion logic to continue searching in the left half of the array even after finding the target. This ensures that you locate the first occurrence. Here's how you can modify your existing code:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint binarySearchFirstOccurrence(int arr[], int low, int high, int target) {\n    if (high >= low) {\n        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;\n        \n        // If the element is found and it's either the first element or not preceded by the same element\n        if ((mid == 0 || arr[mid - 1] != target) && arr[mid] == target) {\n            return mid;\n        }\n        \n        // If target is smaller, it can only be present in the left subarray\n        if (arr[mid] >= target) {\n            return binarySearchFirstOccurrence(arr, low, mid - 1, target);\n        }\n        \n        // Else the element can only be present in the right subarray\n        return binarySearchFirstOccurrence(arr, mid + 1, high, target);\n    }\n    \n    return -1; // Target is not present in the array\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int arr[] = {3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 15, 18, 18, 18, 20, 25}; // Example array with duplicates\n    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);\n    int target = 18;\n    int result = binarySearchFirstOccurrence(arr, 0, n - 1, target);\n    \n    if (result == -1) {\n        cout << \"Element is not present in array\";\n    } else {\n        cout << \"Element is present at the first occurrence at index \" << result;\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Condition Check**: In the modified `binarySearchFirstOccurrence` function, we check if the current middle element is the target and whether it is the first occurrence. This is done by checking if `mid` is the first element or if the preceding element is not the target.\n- **Continue Left Search**: If the current middle element is greater than or equal to the target, we continue searching in the left subarray. This ensures that even if a match is found, we still look for earlier occurrences.\n- **Base Case and Recursion**: The recursion continues until the base case is hit, ensuring the algorithm checks all potential positions for the first occurrence before terminating.\n\nThis modification allows the binary search to correctly return the first occurrence of the target value in an array with duplicates."
