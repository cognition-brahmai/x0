        "content": "To design a program in Java that splits a sentence into words and prints each word on a separate line, you can use the `String.split()` method. This method splits a string around matches of a given regular expression. In this case, you can use a space (\"\\\\s+\") as the delimiter to split the sentence into words. Here's a simple example of how you can do this:\n\n```java\npublic class SentenceSplitter {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Example sentence\n        String sentence = \"This is an example sentence to be split into words.\";\n\n        // Split the sentence into words using space as the delimiter\n        String[] words = sentence.split(\"\\\\s+\");\n\n        // Print each word in a separate line\n        for (String word : words) {\n            System.out.println(word);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **String Declaration**: We declare a `String` variable `sentence` that contains the sentence you want to split.\n\n2. **Splitting the Sentence**: We use `sentence.split(\"\\\\s+\")` to split the sentence into words. The regular expression \"\\\\s+\" matches any whitespace character (like spaces, tabs, etc.) and splits the string at those points.\n\n3. **Loop and Print**: We iterate over the resulting array `words` and print each word on a new line.\n\nThis program will output each word of the sentence on a separate line when executed. If you have punctuation that you want to handle separately, you might need to refine the regular expression or process the words further."
