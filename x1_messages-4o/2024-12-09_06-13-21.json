        "content": "I recently reset my local Flask environment without capturing the dependencies via a pip freeze before I deleted it. As a result, I had to reinstall the latest version of the entire stack. Since this, I am unable to validate with forms. Flask claims that the CSRF token is missing. I am using Flask-WTF and I can see that the form.CSRF_token exists, so why is it claiming it was missing? Even after reinstalling everything, the problem still persists. Is this a new bug or could I be using Flask-WTF wrongly?\n\nHere is my register function:\n\n```python\ndef register():\n    form = RegisterForm()\n    if form.validate_on_submit():\n       ...\n    return make_response(\"register.html\", form=form, error=form.errors)\n```\n\nThe first time I send a Get, I retrieve an empty form.errors as expected. But when I fill out the form and submit it, form.errors is showing: {'csrf_token': [u'CSRF token missing']}. I am also debugging into the following method in Flask-WTF:\n\n```python\ndef validate_csrf_token(self, field):\n    if not self.csrf_enabled:\n        return True\n    if hasattr(request, 'csrf_valid') and request.csrf_valid:\n        # this is validated by CsrfProtect\n        return True\n    if not validate_csrf(field.data, self.SECRET_KEY, self.TIME_LIMIT):\n        raise ValidationError(field.gettext('CSRF token missing'))\n```\nThe last condition is raising the validation error. I have both SECRET_KEY and CSRF_SESSION_KEY in my config defined. What could be the issue here?"

        "content": "It sounds like you're encountering a common issue with CSRF protection in Flask-WTF. Here are a few things you can check and try to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure CSRF Token in Form Template:**\n   Make sure that your form template includes the CSRF token field. In your form rendering template, ensure you have something like this:\n   ```html\n   <form method=\"post\" action=\"{{ url_for('register') }}\">\n       {{ form.hidden_tag() }}\n       <!-- other form fields -->\n       <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Register\">\n   </form>\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Secret Key Configuration:**\n   Verify that `SECRET_KEY` is properly configured in your Flask app's configuration. This key is necessary for generating the CSRF token. Make sure it's not empty or incorrectly set.\n\n3. **Check CSRF Session Key:**\n   While `CSRF_SESSION_KEY` is not a standard Flask-WTF configuration option, ensure that your CSRF configuration is correctly applied. Typically, just setting `SECRET_KEY` is sufficient for CSRF protection.\n\n4. **Verify Form Submission Method:**\n   Ensure that your form is using a `POST` method. CSRF protection is typically applied to `POST` requests.\n\n5. **Inspect Browser Console:**\n   Check your browser's console for any JavaScript errors that might be interfering with the form submission.\n\n6. **Session Configuration:**\n   Make sure your session is properly configured and that the session storage is working. Flask-WTF uses Flask's session to store the CSRF token.\n\n7. **Correct Response Rendering:**\n   Your current response rendering might need adjustment. Use `render_template` instead of `make_response` to ensure the context is correctly passed:\n   ```python\n   return render_template(\"register.html\", form=form, error=form.errors)\n   ```\n\n8. **Flask-WTF Version:**\n   Double-check the version of Flask-WTF you're using. Ensure compatibility with your Flask version. If necessary, downgrade or upgrade to a version that works with your stack.\n\n9. **External Libraries:**\n   If you are using any front-end libraries or frameworks (like AJAX), make sure they are not stripping the CSRF token from the submitted form.\n\n10. **Check for Middleware:**\n    If you have middleware or any other processing logic that might alter requests, ensure it's not affecting the CSRF token.\n\nBy verifying these aspects, you should be able to pinpoint the issue. If the problem persists, consider creating a minimal example application to isolate the problem and test your setup."
