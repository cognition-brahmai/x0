When I try to run a command using Paramiko, it resets the session each time I run `exec_command`. I want to retain the privileges when I execute a command like `sudo` or `su` and run another `exec_command`. Similarly, if I execute `exec_command(\"cd /\")`, I want the subsequent `exec_command` to execute in the root directory. How can I achieve this without running multiple commands in a single `exec_command` call like `exec_command(\"cd /; ls -l\")`?"

        "content": "To execute multiple commands in a single session using the Paramiko library in Python, while retaining the state of the shell (such as the current directory or user privileges), you need to open a persistent shell session using the `invoke_shell()` method. This allows you to interact with the remote shell in a way that retains session state between commands. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Establish an SSH connection using Paramiko.\n2. Open a shell session with `invoke_shell()`.\n3. Use the shell session to send commands and read the outputs.\n\nHere's an example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport paramiko\nimport time\n\n# Set up the SSH client\nssh = paramiko.SSHClient()\nssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())\n\n# Connect to the remote server\nssh.connect(hostname='your_hostname', username='your_username', password='your_password')\n\n# Open a shell session\nshell = ssh.invoke_shell()\n\n# Helper function to send a command and retrieve the output\ndef send_command(command):\n    shell.send(command + '\\n')\n    time.sleep(1)  # Wait for command to execute\n    output = shell.recv(1024).decode('utf-8')\n    return output\n\n# Example of retaining session state\nprint(send_command('cd /'))\nprint(send_command('pwd'))  # Should print /\n\n# Example of running a command with elevated privileges\nprint(send_command('sudo -s'))\ntime.sleep(1)  # Extra wait time for sudo password prompt\noutput = shell.recv(1024).decode('utf-8')\n\n# If prompted for a password, send it\nif \"[sudo] password\" in output:\n    shell.send('your_password\\n')\n    time.sleep(1)\n    output = shell.recv(1024).decode('utf-8')\n\nprint(send_command('whoami'))  # Should print root if sudo was successful\n\n# Close the SSH connection\nssh.close()\n```\n\n### Important Considerations:\n\n- **Security**: Be careful with handling passwords, especially when using them in scripts. Consider more secure methods like SSH keys for authentication.\n- **Time Delays**: The `time.sleep()` function is used to provide enough time for the command to execute and for the shell to return output. You might need to adjust these delays based on the network speed and command execution time.\n- **Output Buffering**: Adjust the buffer size in `shell.recv()` if you expect more output or use a loop to read until you get the expected prompt.\n- **Sudo Privileges**: If using `sudo`, ensure that the user has appropriate privileges and that the password is handled securely. Consider setting up passwordless `sudo` for automation purposes.\n\nThis method allows you to maintain a persistent session and execute commands while retaining state, such as the current working directory or user privileges."
