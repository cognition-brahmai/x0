        "content": "To create an input function in Python that hides sensitive information like a password, you can use the `getpass` module, which is part of the Python standard library. The `getpass` module provides a way to securely handle password prompts by not echoing the input back to the console. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nimport getpass\n\ndef get_hidden_input(prompt='Password: '):\n    return getpass.getpass(prompt)\n\n# Usage\npassword = get_hidden_input(\"Enter your password: \")\nprint(\"Password entered successfully.\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `get_hidden_input` uses `getpass.getpass()` to prompt the user for input. The input is not displayed on the screen as the user types, providing a secure way to enter sensitive information like passwords. The prompt message can be customized by passing a string to the `prompt` parameter."
