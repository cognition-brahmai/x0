The equivalent MongoDB query is:\n\n```ruby\n# Assuming you have already established a connection to the MongoDB database\n# and have the `movies` collection available\n\nmovies_collection = db[:movies]\n\n# Query to find movies with a rating greater than 7.0\nresult = movies_collection.find({ rating: { '$gt' => 7.0 } })\n\n# Iterate over the result to print each document\nresult.each do |document|\n  puts document\nend\n```\n\nMake sure you have the MongoDB Ruby driver installed and set up properly in your environment. You can establish a connection to the database using the `Mongo::Client.new` method, specifying your database details. Then, use the `find` method on the collection to filter documents based on the specified condition."
