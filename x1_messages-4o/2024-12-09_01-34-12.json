In Javascript, I would use the following code:\n\n```javascript\nvar newObject = { 'propertyName' : 'propertyValue' };\nnewObject.propertyName;  // returns \"propertyValue\"\n```\n\nHowever, trying to use the same syntax in Python creates a dictionary instead of an object, and trying to access properties raises an AttributeError. Here's what happens when I tried that:\n\n```python\nnew_object = {'propertyName': 'propertyValue'}\nnew_object.propertyName  # raises an AttributeError\n```\n\nHow can I accomplish this in Python?"

        "content": "In Python, you can achieve similar functionality to JavaScript's object properties by creating a class or using a more dynamic approach such as the `types.SimpleNamespace` or a custom class with dynamic attributes. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Using a Custom Class\n\nYou can define a simple class to encapsulate the properties:\n\n```python\nclass CustomObject:\n    def __init__(self, **kwargs):\n        for key, value in kwargs.items():\n            setattr(self, key, value)\n\nnew_object = CustomObject(propertyName='propertyValue')\nprint(new_object.propertyName)  # Output: propertyValue\n```\n\n### Using `types.SimpleNamespace`\n\nPython's `types` module provides a `SimpleNamespace` class which allows you to create objects with dynamic attributes:\n\n```python\nfrom types import SimpleNamespace\n\nnew_object = SimpleNamespace(propertyName='propertyValue')\nprint(new_object.propertyName)  # Output: propertyValue\n```\n\n### Using a Named Tuple\n\nIf you want immutability, you can also use a named tuple from the `collections` module, although this is less flexible as you cannot add attributes dynamically after creation:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import namedtuple\n\nCustomObject = namedtuple('CustomObject', ['propertyName'])\nnew_object = CustomObject(propertyName='propertyValue')\nprint(new_object.propertyName)  # Output: propertyValue\n```\n\nThese methods allow you to create objects with properties in Python in a way that is somewhat analogous to JavaScript objects with properties. Choose the method that best fits your use case based on whether you need immutability, dynamic properties, or simplicity."
