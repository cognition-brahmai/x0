The error is occurring in the run_migrations_online function in the env.py file. I've tried the solution mentioned in the Stack Overflow post titled \"Request a simple alembic working example for Auto Generating Migrations\" but it doesn't seem to work. What can I do to resolve this import error?"

        "content": "To resolve the import error you're encountering with Alembic in your Flask project, you'll need to adjust your Python import path so that it includes your project's root directory. This is necessary because Python needs to know where to find the `configuration` module when you run your Alembic migrations.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Modify `sys.path` in `env.py`:**\n\n   Add the root directory of your project to the Python path at the start of your `env.py` file. You can do this by appending the path to `sys.path`. Here\u2019s how you can modify your `env.py` file:\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   import os\n\n   # Add the root directory of your project to the Python path\n   sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', '..')))\n\n   from configuration import dev  # Now you should be able to import configuration\n   ```\n\n2. **Set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable:**\n\n   Alternatively, you can set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to include your project root directory before running Alembic commands. This can be done in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/your/project:$PYTHONPATH\n   ```\n\n   Replace `/path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your project directory.\n\n3. **Check Your Alembic Configuration:**\n\n   Ensure that your `alembic.ini` file is correctly configured. In particular, check the `sqlalchemy.url` setting and any other settings that may be relevant to your database configuration.\n\n4. **Check for Virtual Environment Activation:**\n\n   Make sure your virtual environment is activated before running your Alembic commands. This ensures that all necessary packages are available and that the correct Python interpreter is being used.\n\n5. **Use Absolute Imports:**\n\n   Consider using absolute imports in your `env.py` file. This can sometimes help Python resolve module paths more effectively when running scripts directly.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the import error and successfully run your Alembic migrations. If you continue to encounter issues, double-check your project structure and paths to ensure everything is configured correctly."
