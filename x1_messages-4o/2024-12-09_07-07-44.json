        "content": "The error you are encountering is likely due to a misinterpretation of how the `base64` module is being used. The `b64encode` function should indeed be available in the `base64` module, so the issue might stem from the way the file is being read or how the module/function is being accessed.\n\nHere are a few things you can check and a corrected version of the code:\n\n1. **File Reading Mode:** Ensure that the file is opened in binary mode since `b64encode` expects bytes-like objects, not strings.\n\n2. **Correct Usage of `b64encode`:** Make sure you are calling `b64encode` on a bytes object.\n\nHere's a corrected version of your code that should work:\n\n```python\nimport base64\n\n# Open the file in binary mode\nwith open('/Users/Bob/test.txt', 'rb') as f:\n    # Read the entire file content\n    file_content = f.read()\n    # Encode the file content to Base64\n    encoded = base64.b64encode(file_content)\n    # Convert bytes to string for printing\n    encoded_str = encoded.decode('utf-8')\n    print(encoded_str)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- Open the file in binary mode (`'rb'`) to ensure you are reading bytes.\n- Use `f.read()` instead of `f.readlines()` to get the content as a single bytes object.\n- Decode the resulting Base64 bytes to a string for easier printing or further manipulation.\n\nEnsure that your environment does not have a file named `base64.py` that might be shadowing the standard library module. This can sometimes cause issues with accessing module attributes."
