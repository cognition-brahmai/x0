        "content": "Certainly! Below is a simple Python program that converts a given time in hours, minutes, and seconds to total seconds:\n\n```python\ndef time_to_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds):\n    # Calculate total seconds\n    total_seconds = hours * 3600 + minutes * 60 + seconds\n    return total_seconds\n\n# Example usage\nhours = int(input(\"Enter hours: \"))\nminutes = int(input(\"Enter minutes: \"))\nseconds = int(input(\"Enter seconds: \"))\n\ntotal_seconds = time_to_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds)\nprint(f\"The total time in seconds is: {total_seconds}\")\n```\n\n### How It Works:\n1. **Input**: The program takes three inputs: hours, minutes, and seconds.\n2. **Conversion**:\n   - It converts hours to seconds by multiplying by 3600 (since there are 3600 seconds in an hour).\n   - It converts minutes to seconds by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute).\n   - It adds all these together along with the seconds input to get the total in seconds.\n3. **Output**: Finally, it prints the total number of seconds.\n\nYou can run this program in any Python environment. Simply input the desired time, and it will output the total seconds."
