I have a single C extension that is causing a segmentation fault and I need to build it without the -O2 flag, as it's optimizing out certain values and making it difficult to identify the issue. I am working on a legacy product with Python 2.5.1 and Fedora 8, and am unable to change the OS, Python version or recompile Python. How can I modify setup.py to exclude the use of -O2?"

        "content": "To override the default GCC flags used by `setup.py`, you can modify the `extra_compile_args` parameter in the `Extension` object within your `setup.py` script. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Locate the `setup.py` file**: Open the `setup.py` file for your project. This file is responsible for building the C extension.\n\n2. **Modify the `Extension` object**: Find the `Extension` object in the `setup.py` script. It might look something like this:\n\n   ```python\n   from distutils.core import setup, Extension\n\n   module = Extension('your_module_name',\n                      sources=['your_source_file.c'])\n   ```\n\n3. **Add `extra_compile_args`**: Modify the `Extension` object to include the `extra_compile_args` parameter. You can explicitly set this parameter to avoid using `-O2`. Here\u2019s an example of how to do it:\n\n   ```python\n   from distutils.core import setup, Extension\n\n   module = Extension('your_module_name',\n                      sources=['your_source_file.c'],\n                      extra_compile_args=['-g'])  # Use '-g' for debugging symbols and remove optimizations\n   ```\n\n   By specifying `-g` without any optimization flags, you can compile the code with debugging symbols, which might help you identify the segmentation fault.\n\n4. **Rebuild your extension**: Run the setup script to rebuild your extension with the new flags:\n\n   ```bash\n   python setup.py build\n   ```\n\n5. **Test your extension**: After rebuilding, test your extension to see if you can identify the segmentation fault.\n\n6. **Alternative Approach**: If modifying `setup.py` directly isn't effective or is not an option, you can try setting the `CFLAGS` environment variable when running the build command:\n\n   ```bash\n   CFLAGS=\"-g\" python setup.py build\n   ```\n\n   This approach overrides the default compilation flags for the build process.\n\nUsing these steps, you should be able to build your C extension without the `-O2` optimization flag and proceed with debugging the segmentation fault issue."
