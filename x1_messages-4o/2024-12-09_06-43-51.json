        "content": "I am a beginner in Python and I am having difficulty with a script that I am working on. I want to be able to set a variable inside a function using the exec function. In my code, I have two strings, `old_string` which is set to \"didn't work\" and `new_string` which is set to \"worked\". I have a function where I am trying to set `old_string` to be equal to `new_string` using the exec function. However, when I print `old_string` after calling the function, it doesn't show the updated value. Here is my code:\n\n```python\nold_string = \"didnt work\"   \nnew_string = \"worked\"\n\ndef function():\n    exec(\"old_string = new_string\")     \n    print(old_string) \n\nfunction()\n```\n\nHow can I modify this code so that `old_string` gets updated to \"worked\"?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the scope of variables when using `exec` within a function. In Python, variables defined inside a function are local to that function, and using `exec` doesn't automatically update variables in the enclosing scope (i.e., the global scope in this case).\n\nTo modify `old_string` within the function and have the change reflected globally, you can use the `global` keyword to explicitly tell Python that `old_string` refers to the global variable. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nold_string = \"didn't work\"\nnew_string = \"worked\"\n\ndef function():\n    global old_string  # Declare old_string as global\n    exec(\"old_string = new_string\")\n    print(old_string)\n\nfunction()\nprint(old_string)  # This will now print \"worked\"\n```\n\nWith this change, `old_string` is correctly updated globally when `exec` is called within the function. The `global` keyword ensures that you're modifying the global `old_string` variable rather than creating a new local variable with the same name."
