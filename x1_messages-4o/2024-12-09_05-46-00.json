Here's how you can write the equivalent code in Python:\n\n```python\nt = 0\nm = 100 if t == 0 else 5\n```\n\nIn this Python code, `m` is assigned the value `100` if the condition `t == 0` is true; otherwise, it's assigned the value `5`. This is a concise way to write conditional assignments in Python, just like the ternary operator in C++."
