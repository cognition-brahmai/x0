To calculate the average productivity score, you simply divide the total sum of the productivity scores by the number of employees.\n\nHere, the sum of the productivity scores is 850, and there are 10 employees.\n\nAverage productivity score = Total sum of productivity scores / Number of employees\n                           = 850 / 10\n                           = 85\n\nTherefore, the average productivity score of the team is 85."
