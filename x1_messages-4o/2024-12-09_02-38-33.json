I have seen some people use a method where they move the cursor to the end of the file and then use the tell() method to get the size. However, I suspect there might be a simpler, built-in way to do this in Python. Here is the method I have seen:\n\n```python\ndef getSize(fileobject):\n    fileobject.seek(0,2) # move the cursor to the end of the file\n    size = fileobject.tell()\n    return size\n\nfile = open('myfile.bin', 'rb')\nprint getSize(file)\n```"

        "content": "Python does not have a direct built-in function specifically for getting the size of a file object in bytes. However, the method you've described using `seek()` and `tell()` is indeed a common and effective way to determine the size of a file when you have a file object.\n\nAnother approach is to use the `os` module, which provides functions for interacting with the operating system, including getting the size of a file by its path. Here's how you can do it using `os.path.getsize()`:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nfile_path = 'myfile.bin'\nfile_size = os.path.getsize(file_path)\nprint(file_size)\n```\n\nThis method is straightforward and does not require opening the file, making it more efficient if you only need the file size and not the file content. However, if you already have a file object open as in your initial method, using `seek()` and `tell()` is perfectly acceptable."
