Heat over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is slightly thickened. Allow it to cool, then refrigerate.\n\n3. **Churn the Ice Cream:**\n   - Once the ice cream base is chilled, churn it in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n4. **Incorporate the Swirl:**\n   - When the ice cream is almost finished churning, gently fold in the passion fruit mixture to create a swirl effect. Be careful not to overmix.\n\n5. **Freeze and Serve:**\n   - Transfer the ice cream to an airtight container and freeze for at least 4 hours or until firm.\n   - Serve with a garnish of fresh mint leaves and, if desired, a few shavings of black truffle for an extra touch of elegance.\n\nThis gourmet ice cream combines the earthy, umami notes of truffles with the bright, tropical tang of passion fruit, creating a sophisticated and unexpected flavor profile that\u2019s sure to impress.
