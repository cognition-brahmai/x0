        "content": "In Python, you cannot define multiple constructors with different signatures like you can in some other programming languages (e.g., Java or C++). Python uses a single `__init__` method as the constructor, which means you can't directly overload it to handle different sets of parameters.\n\nHowever, you can achieve similar functionality by using default arguments and checking the arguments within the `__init__` method. Here's how you can implement it for your `City` class:\n\n```python\nclass City:\n    def __init__(self, name=None):\n        if name is None:\n            self.name = \"Default City\"\n        else:\n            self.name = name\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"City: {self.name}\"\n\n# Usage:\nsomeCity1 = City()\nsomeCity2 = City(\"Berlin\")\n\nprint(someCity1)  # Output: City: Default City\nprint(someCity2)  # Output: City: Berlin\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Default Argument**: The `__init__` method takes an optional parameter `name` with a default value of `None`. This allows you to call `City()` without any arguments.\n\n2. **Conditional Logic**: Inside the `__init__` method, a conditional check determines whether a name was provided. If not, it assigns a default value (\"Default City\" in this case).\n\n3. **Flexibility**: This approach gives you the flexibility to create instances of the `City` class with or without specifying a name.\n\nThis pattern is commonly used in Python to simulate constructor overloading and is quite effective for managing different initialization scenarios."
