Is there a built-in function in Python that allows me to do this? Or do I have to convert it to a string first? I know how to convert it to a string, but I'm looking for a more efficient way, if one exists. Essentially, I want to be able to write to the file like this:\n\n```python\nwrite_to_file(\"dict = {'one': 1, 'two': 2}\")\n```\n\nWhat is the best way to accomplish this?"

However, you can achieve this by converting the dictionary to a string and then writing it to the file. Here's the best way to do it:\n\n```python\n# Your dictionary\ndict = {'one': 1, 'two': 2}\n\n# Convert the dictionary to a string in the desired format\ndict_string = f\"dict = {dict}\"\n\n# Open the file in write mode and write the string\nwith open('output.py', 'w') as file:\n    file.write(dict_string)\n```\n\nThis code constructs a string that represents the dictionary assignment and writes it to a file named `output.py`. The `with` statement is used to ensure the file is properly closed after writing. The `f-string` (formatted string literal) is used for concise and readable string formatting."
