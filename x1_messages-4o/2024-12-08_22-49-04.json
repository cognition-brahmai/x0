Can you provide me with the mathematical formula and proof for its correctness, as well as an analysis of the space complexity?\nHere's the Swift code for the bitwise operation:\nlet sum = (n * (n + 1)) >> 1\nThe formula is based on the fact that the sum of the first n natural numbers can be calculated by multiplying n by (n+1) and then dividing the result by 2. By using the right-shift operator (>>) to divide the result by 2, we can achieve a time complexity of O(1) since bitwise operations are very fast.\nThe space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) since we only need to store the input value n and the result of the bitwise operation."

        "content": "To efficiently calculate the sum of the first \\( n \\) natural numbers using bitwise operations in Swift, you can indeed use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Sum} = \\frac{n \\times (n + 1)}{2} \\]\n\nThis is a well-known mathematical formula, and its correctness can be proven using mathematical induction. Let's go through the proof and analyze the space complexity:\n\n### Mathematical Formula and Proof\n\n**Formula:**\n\n\\[ \\text{Sum} = \\frac{n \\times (n + 1)}{2} \\]\n\n**Proof by Induction:**\n\n1. **Base Case:**\n   For \\( n = 1 \\), the sum of the first natural number is \\( 1 \\).\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1 \\times (1 + 1)}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1\n   \\]\n   The formula holds for \\( n = 1 \\).\n\n2. **Inductive Step:**\n   Assume that the formula holds for some arbitrary positive integer \\( k \\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum}_k = \\frac{k \\times (k + 1)}{2}\n   \\]\n   Now, prove it holds for \\( k + 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum}_{k+1} = 1 + 2 + \\ldots + k + (k + 1) = \\text{Sum}_k + (k + 1)\n   \\]\n   Substitute the inductive hypothesis:\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{k \\times (k + 1)}{2} + (k + 1)\n   \\]\n   Simplify:\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{k \\times (k + 1) + 2 \\times (k + 1)}{2} = \\frac{(k + 1) \\times (k + 2)}{2}\n   \\]\n   This matches the formula for \\( n = k + 1 \\), completing the inductive step.\n\n### Swift Code with Bitwise Operation\n\nIn Swift, you can use bitwise operations to achieve the same calculation efficiently:\n\n```swift\nlet sum = (n * (n + 1)) >> 1\n```\n\nHere, you multiply \\( n \\) by \\( n + 1 \\) and use the right-shift operator `>>` to divide by 2. Bitwise operations are very fast and provide a time complexity of \\( O(1) \\).\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of this algorithm is \\( O(1) \\). This is because the algorithm only requires a constant amount of space to store the input value \\( n \\) and the resulting sum. No additional data structures or recursive calls are used, which keeps the space usage minimal.\n\nIn summary, using the formula \\((n \\times (n + 1)) >> 1\\) is both time and space efficient for calculating the sum of the first \\( n \\) natural numbers."
