Specifically, if the operation is as follows: `(x, y) = (y, x)`, will this be atomic in cPython, where x and y are Python variables? The question is based on information from the Python FAQ on thread safety of global value mutation."

        "content": "In CPython, the operation `(x, y) = (y, x)` is not guaranteed to be atomic. This operation involves multiple steps: evaluating the right-hand side, which creates a tuple, and then unpacking this tuple to assign the values to the variables on the left-hand side. While these steps may appear to be executed as a single statement in Python, they are not atomic at the bytecode level.\n\nPython's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) does ensure that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time, which can reduce the risk of concurrency issues. However, this does not make the swap operation atomic because other threads can still interleave between the different bytecode instructions involved in the swap.\n\nIf atomicity is required for a variable swap in a multithreaded context, you should use explicit synchronization mechanisms like threading locks to ensure that the operation is performed without interruption. Here is an example using a threading lock:\n\n```python\nimport threading\n\nlock = threading.Lock()\n\ndef swap(x, y):\n    with lock:\n        x, y = y, x\n    return x, y\n```\n\nBy using a lock, you can ensure that the swap operation is performed atomically from the perspective of other threads."
