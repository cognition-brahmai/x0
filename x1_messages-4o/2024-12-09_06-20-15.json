Could you help me understand what values are valid in Pandas 'Freq' tags? I remember seeing a table in the documentation, but I am not able to find it now."

        "content": "Certainly! In Pandas, the `date_range` function allows you to generate a range of dates with a specified frequency, which is controlled by the `freq` parameter. Here are some of the common frequency tags you can use:\n\n1. **B**: Business day frequency\n2. **C**: Custom business day frequency (experimental)\n3. **D**: Calendar day frequency\n4. **W**: Weekly frequency\n5. **M**: Month end frequency\n6. **SM**: Semi-month end frequency (15th and end of month)\n7. **BM**: Business month end frequency\n8. **CBM**: Custom business month end frequency\n9. **MS**: Month start frequency\n10. **SMS**: Semi-month start frequency (1st and 15th)\n11. **BMS**: Business month start frequency\n12. **CBMS**: Custom business month start frequency\n13. **Q**: Quarter end frequency\n14. **BQ**: Business quarter end frequency\n15. **QS**: Quarter start frequency\n16. **BQS**: Business quarter start frequency\n17. **A**: Year end frequency\n18. **BA**: Business year end frequency\n19. **AS**: Year start frequency\n20. **BAS**: Business year start frequency\n21. **H**: Hourly frequency\n22. **T** or **min**: Minutely frequency\n23. **S**: Secondly frequency\n24. **L** or **ms**: Millisecond frequency\n25. **U** or **us**: Microsecond frequency\n26. **N**: Nanosecond frequency\n\nAdditionally, you can use multiples of these frequencies by appending an integer. For example, '5D' would mean every 5 days, and '10min' would mean every 10 minutes.\n\nThere are also some less common and more specialized tags, but the ones listed above cover most typical use cases. If you're looking for very specific frequency behavior, you might also consider using custom frequencies or combining these with offsets."
