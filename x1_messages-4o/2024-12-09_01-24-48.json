When I'm using absolute imports in my modules, I don't encounter any issues. However, when I switch to relative imports and try to import one of the modules, I encounter an ImportError. Can you explain why this error occurs? Isn't the situation with relative imports the same as with absolute imports? Here are the modules and the error message:\n\n`a.py`:\n```python\nimport b\ndef f(): return b.y\nx = 42\n```\n\n`b.py`:\n```python\nimport a\ndef g(): return a.x\ny = 43\n```\n\nWhen I change the imports to relative imports, like `from . import b`, and try to import one of the modules, I get an ImportError:\n\n```python\n>>> import pkg.a\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"pkg/a.py\", line 1, in <module>\n    from . import b\n  File \"pkg/b.py\", line 1, in <module>\n    from . import a\nImportError: cannot import name a\n```\n\nI'm aware of ways to avoid the circular dependency, but I'm interested in understanding the reason for the error."

        "content": "The ImportError you're encountering when using relative imports in the presence of cyclic dependencies is due to how Python handles module imports, specifically with the way relative imports work within a package.\n\nWhen you use absolute imports, such as `import b` in `a.py` and `import a` in `b.py`, Python looks for the modules in the specified package or directory. The modules are imported into the global namespace, and Python can resolve the names because it processes the imports in a way that allows it to handle partial imports, which means that even if a module is not fully initialized, its name can be resolved in the namespace.\n\nHowever, when you switch to relative imports with `from . import b` in `a.py` and `from . import a` in `b.py`, Python's import system works differently. Relative imports rely on the context of the current module's position within the package hierarchy. During the import process, Python creates a module object and adds it to `sys.modules` before executing the module's code. When `a.py` tries to import `b` relatively, it triggers the import of `b.py`, which then tries to import `a` again. At this point, since `a` is not yet fully initialized (it's still in the process of being executed), Python raises an ImportError because the name `a` is not available for relative import in `b.py`.\n\nIn summary, the key difference is that relative imports are more sensitive to the order and state of module execution during cyclic imports. With absolute imports, Python is able to handle partially imported modules more gracefully, whereas relative imports require the module to be fully initialized, leading to an ImportError when cyclic dependencies are present and the module isn't fully loaded yet."
