I have encountered this issue when trying to import a .py file that was previously compiled into a .pyc file. The interesting thing is, sometimes the file imports without any issues, other times it fails. The error message I receive from Python isn't very clear. Here is the traceback:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"run.py\", line 7, in <module>\n    from Normalization import Normalizer\n```"

        "content": "The \"Bad magic number\" error in Python typically occurs when there is a mismatch between the version of Python that generated the `.pyc` file and the version that is trying to read it. The magic number is essentially a version identifier for the bytecode, and if it doesn't match what the Python interpreter expects, you'll see this error.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Delete the `.pyc` files**: The simplest solution is to delete the `.pyc` files and let Python recompile them. You can do this manually by finding and deleting the `.pyc` files, or you can remove the entire `__pycache__` directory where these files are typically stored.\n\n2. **Ensure Consistent Python Versions**: Make sure you are using the same version of Python across your development and deployment environments. This includes ensuring that any virtual environments are activated correctly.\n\n3. **Check for Multiple Python Installations**: Verify that you do not have multiple installations of Python on your system that might be causing the confusion. This can happen if you have both Python 2.x and Python 3.x installed, for example.\n\n4. **Clean and Rebuild**: If you are using any build tools or frameworks, try cleaning the build and then rebuilding to ensure that everything is consistent.\n\n5. **Use Virtual Environments**: If you are not already using virtual environments, consider doing so. This helps maintain a consistent environment across different systems and can prevent such issues.\n\n6. **Double-check Imports**: Sometimes, the issue can be related to how imports are structured. Ensure that all imports are correctly specified and that there are no circular imports causing unexpected behavior.\n\n7. **Check File System for Corruption**: Although less common, file corruption or issues with the file system can cause problems like this. Make sure your file system is healthy and that there are no underlying hardware issues.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"Bad magic number\" ImportError. If the problem persists, consider providing more specific details about your environment and setup for further assistance."
