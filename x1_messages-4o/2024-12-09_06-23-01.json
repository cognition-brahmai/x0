I have written a code to count the number of lines in a file but I am unsure about how to delete a specific line number.

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to do this:\n\n1. Open the file and read all the lines.\n2. Remove the last line from the list of lines.\n3. Write the remaining lines back to the file.\n\nHere's a Python script to achieve this:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Open the file in read mode\n    with open(\"file\", \"r\") as file:\n        lines = file.readlines()\n    \n    # Remove the last line\n    if lines:\n        lines.pop()\n    \n    # Open the file in write mode and write the remaining lines\n    with open(\"file\", \"w\") as file:\n        file.writelines(lines)\n\n    print(\"Last line deleted successfully.\")\nexcept IOError:\n    print(\"Failed to read or write to the file.\")\n```\n\nThis script opens the file, reads all the lines into a list, removes the last line using `pop()`, and then writes the modified list of lines back to the file. Make sure to handle the file operations with care to avoid data loss."
