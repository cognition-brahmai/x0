        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that `model.summary()` doesn't return a string; instead, it prints the model summary directly to the console. To capture this output and write it to a file, you need to redirect the standard output temporarily. Here\u2019s how you can do it using Python\u2019s `io.StringIO`:\n\n```python\nimport io\nfrom contextlib import redirect_stdout\n\n# Open your file for writing\nwith open(filename + 'report.txt', 'w') as out:\n    # Write your hyperparameters and other information\n    out.write(\"Hyperparameters\\n\")\n    out.write(\"=========================\\n\\n\")\n    out.write(\"learning_rate: 0.01\\n\")\n    out.write(\"momentum: 0.8\\n\")\n    out.write(\"decay: 0.0\\n\")\n    out.write(\"batch size: 128\\n\")\n    out.write(\"no. epochs: 3\\n\")\n    out.write(\"dropout: 0.5\\n\")\n    out.write(\"-------------------------\\n\\n\")\n\n    # Redirect the standard output to capture the model summary\n    with io.StringIO() as buf, redirect_stdout(buf):\n        model.summary()\n        summary = buf.getvalue()\n    \n    # Write the model summary to the file\n    out.write(summary)\n\n    # Write the remaining information\n    out.write(f\"val_acc: 0.232323229313\\n\")\n    out.write(f\"val_loss: 3.88496732712\\n\")\n    out.write(f\"train_acc: 0.0965207634216\\n\")\n    out.write(f\"train_loss: 4.07161939425\\n\")\n    out.write(f\"train/val loss ratio: 1.04804469418\\n\")\n```\n\nThis code uses `redirect_stdout` to capture what would normally be printed to the console by `model.summary()`. It then writes this captured output to your file. Make sure to replace placeholders with your actual hyperparameters and metrics as needed."
