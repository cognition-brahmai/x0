I have set up the package correctly in my local directory and installed it using \"pip install -e c:\\users\\worker\\src\\clockwork\\lib\\credentials\". However, when I try to import this package from a sibling directory, I encounter an ImportError: No module named 'credentials'. Despite the error, when I list the installed packages using 'pip list', 'credentials' package is listed as successfully installed. I am currently adding the directory containing the package to my PATH variable as a workaround. How can I properly install my local package so that it can be imported without modifying the PATH?"

        "content": "When dealing with local Python packages and trying to import them from different directories, it's important to ensure that the Python environment recognizes the package correctly. Here are a few steps and tips to ensure your local package is installed and imported properly:\n\n1. **Directory Structure**: Make sure your package has a proper directory structure. Typically, your package directory (e.g., `credentials`) should contain an `__init__.py` file (even if it's empty) to be recognized as a package.\n\n   ```\n   credentials/\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 module1.py\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 module2.py\n   \u2514\u2500\u2500 ...\n   ```\n\n2. **Editable Installation**: You mentioned using `pip install -e`. This command is used for installing a package in \"editable\" mode. This should work if you have a proper `setup.py` file in place. Your `setup.py` might look something like this:\n\n   ```python\n   from setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\n   setup(\n       name='credentials',\n       version='0.1',\n       packages=find_packages(),\n   )\n   ```\n\n   Ensure that you're running this command from the directory where `setup.py` is located.\n\n3. **Python Path**: Instead of modifying the PATH environment variable, consider adding the package directory to the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable. This variable tells Python where to look for modules and packages. You can set it like this:\n\n   **On Windows:**\n\n   ```cmd\n   set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\\users\\worker\\src\\clockwork\\lib\n   ```\n\n   **On Unix-based systems:**\n\n   ```bash\n   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/users/worker/src/clockwork/lib\n   ```\n\n4. **Check the Installation**: After installing with `pip install -e`, navigate to the directory where you\u2019re trying to import the package and run Python interactively:\n\n   ```bash\n   python\n   ```\n\n   Then try importing the package to see if the issue persists:\n\n   ```python\n   import credentials\n   ```\n\n5. **Virtual Environment**: If you're using a virtual environment, make sure it's active when you're installing and importing the package.\n\n6. **Reinstall**: If everything seems correct but the issue persists, try uninstalling and reinstalling the package:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall credentials\n   pip install -e c:\\users\\worker\\src\\clockwork\\lib\\credentials\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to import your local package without issues. If the problem still persists, double-check the directory paths and ensure the `setup.py` is correctly configured."
