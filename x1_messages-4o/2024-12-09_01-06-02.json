A Unicode code unit is represented by a string object of one item and can hold either a 16-bit or 32-bit value representing a Unicode ordinal (the maximum value for the ordinal is given in sys.maxunicode, and depends on how Python is configured at compile time). Surrogate pairs may be present in the Unicode object, and will be reported as two separate items.\" Based on this, is the internal representation of a Unicode string UTF-16?"

        "content": "In Python 3.x, the internal representation of a string is a bit more complex than simply using UTF-16. Python 3.x uses a flexible internal representation for Unicode strings called \"Flexible String Representation\" (PEP 393). This representation allows Python to choose the most efficient storage format for each string, depending on the maximum ordinal value of the characters it contains. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Latin-1 (1 byte per character)**: If all the characters in the string have ordinals less than 256, Python uses a Latin-1 representation, which uses 1 byte per character.\n\n2. **UCS-2/UTF-16 (2 bytes per character)**: If the characters have ordinals less than 65536, Python uses a UCS-2-like representation, which uses 2 bytes per character. This means it can represent characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) directly but uses surrogate pairs for characters outside the BMP.\n\n3. **UCS-4/UTF-32 (4 bytes per character)**: If any character in the string has an ordinal of 65536 or higher, Python uses a UCS-4-like representation, which uses 4 bytes per character. This can handle any Unicode character without surrogate pairs.\n\nSo, while Python may use a UTF-16-like structure in some cases, it doesn't strictly adhere to UTF-16 for all strings. Instead, it dynamically selects the representation based on the content of the string, optimizing for memory usage and performance.\n\nFurthermore, the maximum value for a Unicode ordinal is determined by `sys.maxunicode`, which is 1114111 (0x10FFFF) on most modern systems, allowing for all valid Unicode code points.\n\nThis adaptive approach allows Python to efficiently store and process Unicode strings, whether they contain only ASCII characters or symbols from the full range of Unicode."
