I have a dataframe like the following:\n\n```\n    col \n1     a\n2     0\n```\n\nAnd I would like to transform it into something like this:\n\n```\n       col \n1     stra\n2     str0\n```\n\nCurrently, I am using the following code:\n\n```\ndf.ix[(df['col'] != False), 'col'] = 'str'+df[(df['col'] != False), 'col']\n```\n\nHowever, it seems quite inefficient and it doesn't handle rows where the column value is 0 or NaN. Is there a better way to achieve this?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this in a more efficient and elegant way using the `apply` method along with a lambda function, which is a more concise approach. Here's how you can prepend a string prefix to each value in a specific column of a pandas DataFrame:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {'col': ['a', 0, np.nan]}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Prepend 'str' to each non-NaN value in the 'col' column\ndf['col'] = df['col'].apply(lambda x: f'str{x}' if pd.notna(x) else x)\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThis code will handle `0` and `NaN` values effectively by first checking if the value is not `NaN` using `pd.notna(x)`. It then prepends the string `'str'` to the value if it's not `NaN`.\n\nThe output would be:\n\n```\n    col\n0  stra\n1  str0\n2  NaN\n```\n\nThis approach is more efficient than using `df.ix` and avoids issues with boolean indexing on `NaN` values."
