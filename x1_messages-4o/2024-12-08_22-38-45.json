In addition, please ensure that each activity is also arranged in order of their popularity, with basketball being the most popular, followed by sports, and then dance. The solution should require the identification of each activity's specific lexical properties and popularity ranking, as well as the comparison of multiple pairs of activities to obtain the final order."

        "content": "To organize the list of physical activities in both lexicographic order and popularity order, let's first understand what you are asking. Lexicographic order means sorting based on the dictionary order of the names, while the popularity order you provided is as follows: basketball being the most popular, followed by sports, and then dance.\n\nGiven these criteria, let's assume we have a list of activities. For the sake of illustration, let's use the following list:\n\n1. Basketball\n2. Dance\n3. Sports\n\nFirst, we'll arrange them in lexicographic order:\n\n- Basketball\n- Dance\n- Sports\n\nNow let's rearrange them based on the given popularity ranking:\n\n1. Basketball (most popular)\n2. Sports\n3. Dance (least popular)\n\nThus, the final order, taking both lexicographic and popularity considerations into account, is:\n\n1. Basketball\n2. Sports\n3. Dance\n\nIf you have a different list of activities you would like me to sort, please provide the list, and I will apply the same logic to organize them."
