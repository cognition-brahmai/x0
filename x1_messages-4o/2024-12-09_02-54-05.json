        "content": "I have recently taken over a large codebase that requires some minor modifications. I am interested in finding out if there are any utilities that can parse Python code and provide dependencies between functions. My goal is to ensure that any changes I make to a function do not disrupt other functions. Would it be possible to visualize these dependencies in a graph-like diagram?"

        "content": "Yes, there are several tools and libraries available that can help you analyze and visualize dependencies between functions in a Python codebase. Here are some options you can explore:\n\n1. **Static Analysis Tools**:\n   - **PyDeps**: This tool generates a dependency graph of your Python project. While it primarily focuses on module dependencies, it can give you a high-level view of your codebase.\n   - **Pylint**: While primarily a linting tool, Pylint can help analyze dependencies and provide insights into your code.\n\n2. **Code Analysis Libraries**:\n   - **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)**: Python's built-in `ast` module can be used to parse and analyze Python code. You can write custom scripts to extract function definitions and their dependencies.\n   - **Rope**: A Python refactoring library that provides programmatic access to analyze code dependencies. It can be used to track dependencies between functions.\n\n3. **Visualization Tools**:\n   - **Graphviz**: Once you have extracted the dependencies using a tool or library, you can use Graphviz to create visual representations of these dependencies. You can generate DOT files and render them as graphs.\n   - **NetworkX**: A Python library for the creation, manipulation, and study of complex networks. You can use it to generate and visualize graphs based on the dependencies you extract.\n\n4. **Integrated Solutions**:\n   - **Doxygen with Doxygraph**: Although traditionally used for C++, Doxygen can be configured to work with Python. With the addition of Doxygraph, you can visualize dependencies in a graph-like manner.\n\nTo get started, you might want to write a script using the `ast` module to analyze the Abstract Syntax Tree of your codebase, extract function calls, and then use NetworkX or Graphviz to visualize these relationships. This approach gives you a high degree of customization to fit your specific needs."
