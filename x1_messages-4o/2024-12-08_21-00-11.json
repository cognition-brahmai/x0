Also, can you provide examples of how to use this code to check the word count of each of the following genres: mystery, romance, and science fiction? Additionally, can you provide a PHP code example that uses the provided HTML template to display the book title, author, summary, analysis, and recommendation for each review on our website?"

        "content": "To validate the minimum word count of 500 for each book review submitted on your website, you can use PHP to count the words in the submitted text and check if it meets the required count. Here's a basic example of how you could implement this:\n\n### PHP Code for Word Count Validation\n\n```php\nfunction validateWordCount($review, $minWords = 500) {\n    $wordCount = str_word_count($review);\n    return $wordCount >= $minWords;\n}\n\n// Example usage for different genres\n$reviews = [\n    'mystery' => \"Your mystery book review text goes here...\",\n    'romance' => \"Your romance book review text goes here...\",\n    'science_fiction' => \"Your science fiction book review text goes here...\"\n];\n\nforeach ($reviews as $genre => $review) {\n    if (validateWordCount($review)) {\n        echo \"The $genre review meets the minimum word count requirement.<br>\";\n    } else {\n        echo \"The $genre review does NOT meet the minimum word count requirement.<br>\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### PHP Code to Display Book Review Details\n\nAssuming you have an HTML template to display the book details, you can incorporate PHP to dynamically populate these details. Here's a simple example:\n\n```php\nfunction displayBookReview($title, $author, $summary, $analysis, $recommendation) {\n    echo \"\n    <div class='book-review'>\n        <h2>Book Title: $title</h2>\n        <h3>Author: $author</h3>\n        <div class='summary'>\n            <h4>Summary</h4>\n            <p>$summary</p>\n        </div>\n        <div class='analysis'>\n            <h4>Analysis</h4>\n            <p>$analysis</p>\n        </div>\n        <div class='recommendation'>\n            <h4>Recommendation</h4>\n            <p>$recommendation</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    \";\n}\n\n// Example usage\ndisplayBookReview(\n    \"The Great Mystery\",\n    \"John Doe\",\n    \"This is a summary of the mystery book.\",\n    \"This is an analysis of the mystery book.\",\n    \"I highly recommend this mystery book.\"\n);\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Word Count Validation**: The `validateWordCount` function calculates the number of words in the review using `str_word_count()` and checks if it meets the minimum requirement. The example demonstrates how to use this function for different book genres.\n\n2. **Displaying Book Review**: The `displayBookReview` function accepts parameters for the book title, author, summary, analysis, and recommendation, and then outputs them in an HTML structure. This is a simple way to dynamically render each book review on your website.\n\nYou can integrate these examples into your website's PHP codebase as needed. Adjust the HTML and styles to match your website's design."
