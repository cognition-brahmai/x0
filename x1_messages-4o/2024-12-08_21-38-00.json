        "content": "To find the smallest prime factor of the 13th root of 1001, we need to start with the prime factorization of 1001 and then determine the 13th root.\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of 1001\n\nLet's find the prime factors of 1001:\n\n1. Check divisibility by 2: 1001 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.\n2. Check divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of 1001 is 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 2, which is not divisible by 3.\n3. Check divisibility by 5: 1001 does not end in 0 or 5, so it's not divisible by 5.\n4. Check divisibility by 7: \n   \\[\n   1001 \\div 7 = 143 \n   \\]\n   Since 143 is an integer, 7 is a factor.\n5. Now factor 143. Check divisibility by 2, 3, 5: \n   - 143 is not divisible by 2, as it's odd.\n   - The sum of digits of 143 is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8, not divisible by 3.\n   - 143 does not end in 0 or 5, so it's not divisible by 5.\n6. Check divisibility by 11:\n   \\[\n   143 \\div 11 = 13 \n   \\]\n   Since 13 is a prime number, 11 and 13 are factors.\n\nThus, the prime factorization of 1001 is:\n\\[\n1001 = 7 \\times 11 \\times 13\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the 13th Root\n\nThe 13th root of 1001 can be considered in terms of its prime factors:\n\\[\n1001^{1/13} = (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)^{1/13}\n\\]\n\nThe 13th root of each prime factor individually is:\n\\[\n7^{1/13}, \\quad 11^{1/13}, \\quad 13^{1/13}\n\\]\n\nSince we're interested in the smallest prime factor of the 13th root, and each of these numbers is raised to the power of \\(1/13\\), the smallest of the original prime factors will remain the smallest after taking the root.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the smallest prime factor of 1001 is 7, and taking the 13th root does not change the ordering of the factors. Thus, the smallest prime factor of the 13th root of 1001 is also 7."
