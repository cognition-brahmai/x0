For instance, if I have a function like this:\n\n```python\nprint numberFormat(1234)\n```\n\nI want the output to be:\n\n```python\n1,234\n```\n\nIs there a built-in function in Python that can accomplish this task?"

        "content": "Yes, Python provides a very convenient way to format numbers with commas as thousand separators using the built-in `format()` function or formatted string literals (also known as f-strings in Python 3.6 and above). Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n### Using the `format()` function:\n\nYou can use the `format()` function with the `,` as the format specifier to add commas as thousand separators.\n\n```python\ndef numberFormat(number):\n    return format(number, \",\")\n\nprint(numberFormat(1234))  # Output: 1,234\n```\n\n### Using f-strings (Python 3.6+):\n\nF-strings provide a concise way to format strings and can also be used to format numbers with commas.\n\n```python\ndef numberFormat(number):\n    return f\"{number:,}\"\n\nprint(numberFormat(1234))  # Output: 1,234\n```\n\nBoth methods will give you the desired output of formatting integers with commas as thousand separators."
