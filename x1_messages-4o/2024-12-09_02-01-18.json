I have been using a method that involves creating an IPython extension which sets the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE and runs django.setup() when IPython starts. However, with a recent upgrade to Jupyter Notebook, this setup is no longer working. I can run Django code in the Jupyter notebook by adding a similar bit of code to the first cell of the notebook, but I have not been able to figure out how to get Jupyter to run the extension automatically. I'm using Django 1.8.5 with Jupyter 1.0.0. Can you help me get Django and Jupyter to work together smoothly?\n\nHere's the code for the extension I've been using:\n\n```\ndef load_ipython_extension(ipython):\n    # The `ipython` argument is the currently active `InteractiveShell`\n    # instance, which can be used in any way. This allows you to register\n    # new magics or aliases, for example.\n    try:\n        import os\n        os.environ.setdefault(\"DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\", \"settings\")\n        import django\n        django.setup()\n    except ImportError:\n        pass\n```\n\nAnd here's the code I run in the notebook:\n\n```\nimport os, sys\nsys.path.insert(0, '/path/to/project')\nos.environ.setdefault(\"DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\", \"settingsfile\")\nimport django\ndjango.setup()\n```"

        "content": "To integrate Django with Jupyter/IPython Notebook and streamline your workflow, you can follow a few steps to ensure that Django is properly set up whenever you start a Jupyter Notebook. Given the issues with the extension you were using, here's a refined approach that should work with your setup:\n\n1. **Create a Jupyter Notebook Configuration File:**\n\n   - If you don't already have a Jupyter configuration file, create one by running the following command in your terminal:\n     ```bash\n     jupyter notebook --generate-config\n     ```\n   - This will create a file named `jupyter_notebook_config.py` in your Jupyter configuration directory (usually `~/.jupyter/`).\n\n2. **Create a Custom Startup Script:**\n\n   - Navigate to the Jupyter startup folder. If it doesn't exist, create it:\n     ```bash\n     mkdir -p ~/.ipython/profile_default/startup/\n     ```\n   - Inside the `startup` directory, create a new Python file, e.g., `00-django-setup.py`. This file will execute every time you start a Jupyter notebook.\n\n3. **Add Django Setup Code to the Startup Script:**\n\n   - Add the following code to your `00-django-setup.py` file:\n     ```python\n     import os\n     import django\n     import sys\n\n     # Set the path to your Django project\n     sys.path.insert(0, '/path/to/your/project')\n\n     # Set the Django settings module\n     os.environ.setdefault(\"DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\", \"your_project_name.settings\")\n\n     # Setup Django\n     django.setup()\n     ```\n\n   - Make sure to replace `'/path/to/your/project'` with the actual path to your Django project and `your_project_name.settings` with the correct settings module path.\n\n4. **Verify the Setup:**\n\n   - Start your Jupyter Notebook as usual:\n     ```bash\n     jupyter notebook\n     ```\n   - Open a new notebook and try importing your Django models or running Django-specific commands to verify that the setup is working as expected.\n\n5. **Optional - Use Jupyter Magic Commands:**\n\n   - You can also create custom magic commands if you're frequently running specific Django tasks. This involves more advanced configuration but can be very useful for repetitive tasks.\n\nThis setup should ensure that Django is correctly initialized every time you start a Jupyter Notebook, allowing you to work with Django models and other components seamlessly."
