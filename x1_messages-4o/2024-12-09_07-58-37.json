Is there an \"enhanced regular expression\" implementation for Perl that has similar features?

        "content": "Regular expressions are a powerful tool for pattern matching and text processing, and various languages have different levels of support for certain features like lookbehind assertions. Let's break down your questions:\n\n### Variable-Length Lookbehind Assertions\n\n1. **Python**: The built-in `re` module in Python does not support variable-length lookbehind assertions; only fixed-length is supported. However, the `regex` module (an external library) does support variable-length lookbehind assertions. You can install it using `pip install regex`.\n\n2. **PHP**: As of PHP 7.3, the PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) library supports variable-length lookbehind assertions, so you can use them directly in PHP.\n\n3. **JavaScript**: Lookbehind assertions were introduced in ECMAScript 2018, but only fixed-length lookbehinds are supported in JavaScript.\n\n4. **Perl**: The standard Perl regular expressions do not support variable-length lookbehind assertions. Perl's regex engine is quite powerful, but this is one area where it doesn't have native support.\n\n### Writing a Regular Expression Without Lookbehind\n\nTo rewrite a regular expression without using lookbehind, you might need to adjust your approach depending on the problem you're solving. For example, if your pattern is `/(?<!foo.*)bar/`, you might need to use logic outside of regex or refactor the regex to match contexts where `bar` is valid without preceding `foo`.\n\n### Possibility of Implementation\n\nVariable-length lookbehind assertions might be implemented in other engines over time as regex libraries evolve. However, this depends on the maintainers and the balance between complexity and utility.\n\n### Enhanced Regular Expressions\n\n1. **Perl**: There isn't a direct \"enhanced\" version like Python's `regex` module, but Perl's regex capabilities are already extensive. Some Perl modules, like `Regexp::Grammars`, offer more advanced parsing capabilities, though not specifically for variable-length lookbehind.\n\n2. **Ruby**: Ruby supports fixed-length lookbehind but not variable-length. There's no direct equivalent of Python's `regex` module for Ruby.\n\n3. **Java**: Java's regex engine (`java.util.regex`) supports only fixed-length lookbehind assertions.\n\n4. **JavaScript**: As mentioned, JavaScript supports fixed-length lookbehind as of ECMAScript 2018.\n\n5. **PHP**: PHP, using PCRE, does support variable-length lookbehind since version 7.3.\n\n### Specifying the End Point for `\\K`\n\nThe `\\K` in regular expressions resets the starting point of the reported match. It allows you to exclude part of the match from the overall matched string. While it doesn't allow for specifying an endpoint directly, it can be used creatively to manipulate what part of the string is reported as a match.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIf you require variable-length lookbehind assertions and aren't limited by language constraints, consider using Python's `regex` module or PHP's PCRE support. For languages that don't support them natively, you might need to refactor your approach or use additional logic outside regex. Libraries and language updates might bring these features in the future, so keeping an eye on language updates is advisable."
