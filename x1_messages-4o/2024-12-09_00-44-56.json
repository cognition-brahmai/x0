When I extract methods using Eclipse with PyDev, the extracted method is placed above the modified method, putting lower level details before higher level ones. This contradicts the advice from Robert C. Martin, who suggests to do the opposite, akin to reading the headlines of a newspaper. I follow such advice while programming in Java, but I am uncertain about the best practice for Python."

        "content": "When organizing methods in a Python class, the general principles are similar to those in other programming languages, but there are some Python-specific considerations you might want to keep in mind. Here\u2019s a structure that balances readability and maintainability:\n\n1. **Class-Level Attributes and Constants**: Start with any class-level constants or attributes, if applicable.\n\n2. **Initializer (`__init__`) Method**: Place the constructor or initializer method next. This helps readers understand how the class is instantiated and what its initial state will be.\n\n3. **Dunder (Magic) Methods**: Follow the initializer with any special methods (also known as dunder methods) like `__str__`, `__repr__`, `__len__`, etc. These methods define the behavior of instances of your class with respect to Python's built-in functions and operations.\n\n4. **Public Methods**: List the public methods next. These are the main methods that users of your class will interact with. Order them in a way that tells a logical story or flow of usage, similar to reading through a newspaper article.\n\n5. **Private Methods**: Place private (helper) methods after the public methods. These are methods intended for internal use within the class and are usually prefixed with an underscore.\n\n6. **Static and Class Methods**: If your class contains static or class methods, place them towards the end, after instance methods, unless they are related to instance lifecycle or creation.\n\n7. **Ordering by Dependency**: Within each of these categories, you can order methods based on dependency. Methods that are called by other methods should be placed below them, aligning with the top-down approach recommended by Robert C. Martin. This way, when reading the class, you see the higher-level behavior before diving into the details.\n\n8. **Documentation and Comments**: Ensure that each method is well-documented with docstrings explaining its purpose, parameters, and return values. Inline comments can help clarify complex logic.\n\nWhile this is a general guideline, remember that consistency within your codebase is key. If you're working with a team, adopting a style guide that everyone follows can be very beneficial. In Python, the PEP 8 style guide is a widely accepted standard that can help ensure consistency, though it doesn't prescribe method order specifically."
