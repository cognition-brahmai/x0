        "content": "To modify your Ruby code to randomly select at least three events from the `events` array and ensure they are not in chronological order, you can use the `sample` method combined with `shuffle`. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```ruby\nevents = [\"Event 1\", \"Event 2\", \"Event 3\", \"Event 4\", \"Event 5\"]\nstory = \"\"\n\n# Randomly select at least three events\nselected_events = events.sample(3 + rand(events.size - 2)) # Ensures at least 3 events are selected\n\n# Shuffle the selected events to ensure they are not in chronological order\nshuffled_events = selected_events.shuffle\n\n# Generate the story using the shuffled events\nstory = shuffled_events.join(\", \")\n\nputs \"Generated story: #{story}\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`sample` Method**: The `sample` method is used to randomly select elements from the array. Here, we use `sample(3 + rand(events.size - 2))` to ensure at least three events are selected. The expression `rand(events.size - 2)` ensures that you can select up to the total number of events available, but always at least three.\n\n2. **`shuffle` Method**: The `shuffle` method is used to randomize the order of the selected events, ensuring they are not in chronological order.\n\n3. **Generating the Story**: The selected and shuffled events are joined with a separator (\", \") to create a coherent story string.\n\nThis code snippet will provide you with a random selection of at least three events, shuffled, and included in a story."
