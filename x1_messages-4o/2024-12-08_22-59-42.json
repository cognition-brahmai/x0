Below, I provide a detailed classification using these criteria with examples and descriptions:\n\n### Classification by Origin\n\n1. **African Instruments**\n   - **Djembe**: A rope-tuned skin-covered goblet drum played with bare hands, originating from West Africa.

**Hurdy-Gurdy**: A string instrument that produces sound by a crank-turned, rosined wheel rubbing against the strings, originating from France.\n   - **Lute**: A plucked string instrument with a neck and a deep round back, associated with the Renaissance period.\n\n### Classification by Material\n\n1. **Wood Instruments**\n   - **Clarinet**: A single-reed woodwind instrument made from wood, known for its wide range and warm sound.\n   - **Oboe**: A double-reed woodwind instrument made from wood, noted for its clear and penetrating voice.\n   - **Bassoon**: A large woodwind instrument with a double reed and a distinctive, rich tone.\n   - **Acoustic Guitar**: Typically made of wood, it uses the vibration of strings to produce sound.\n   - **Marimba**: A percussion instrument with wooden bars and resonators, producing a warm, resonant sound.\n\n2. **Metal Instruments**\n   - **Trumpet**: A brass instrument known for its bright, powerful sound.\n   - **Trombone**: A brass instrument with a telescoping slide mechanism that varies the length of the tube to change pitches.\n   - **French Horn**: A brass instrument with a wide range of tones, from mellow to bright.\n   - **Flute**: Although traditionally made from wood, modern flutes are often made from metal, producing a bright, clear sound.\n   - **Tuba**: The largest brass instrument, known for its deep, rich sound.\n\n3. **String Instruments**\n   - **Cello**: A bowed string instrument with a deep, rich sound, larger than a violin.\n   - **Double Bass**: The largest and lowest-pitched bowed string instrument used in orchestras.\n   -

**Bass Clarinet**: A clarinet family member with a deep, rich sound and a range that extends lower than the standard clarinet.\n   - **Pan Flute**: A musical instrument based on the principle of the closed tube, consisting of multiple pipes of gradually increasing length.\n   - **Didgeridoo**: A wind instrument developed by Indigenous Australians, made from a hollowed tree trunk and played by vibrating the lips to produce a continuous drone.\n\nThis classification offers a glimpse into the rich diversity of musical instruments across different cultures, materials, and sound production methods, each with its own unique characteristics and history."
