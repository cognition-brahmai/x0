However, this results in an IOError with 'Permission denied' message. I am able to achieve the desired result with the read/write ('r+') mode though. I am using Python 2.6.6 on a Windows 7 x64 system and the target file has its hidden attribute set. When I tried turning off the hidden attribute, 'w' mode operation succeeds. But when I turn it back on, it fails again. I would like to know why 'w' mode fails on hidden files? Is this a known behavior?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with opening hidden files in write mode ('w') on Windows is related to how the Windows operating system handles file attributes, particularly for hidden files. In Windows, hidden files have a special attribute that can affect how they're accessed by applications, including Python scripts.\n\nWhen you open a file in 'w' mode, Python tries to create a new file, which involves deleting the existing file first. If the file is hidden, Windows may prevent this operation due to its attribute settings, causing a \"Permission denied\" error. This behavior is specific to how Windows handles file attributes and permissions.\n\nOn the other hand, when you open the file in 'r+' mode, you're opening it for reading and writing without deleting it first. This operation does not trigger the same permission checks related to file creation/deletion, and thus it succeeds.\n\nHere are a few approaches you can consider:\n\n1. **Change File Attributes Temporarily**: Before opening the file in 'w' mode, you can temporarily remove the hidden attribute using the `attrib` command in a subprocess call, perform your file operations, and then restore the hidden attribute once done.\n\n    ```python\n    import subprocess\n\n    # Remove hidden attribute\n    subprocess.call(['attrib', '-H', 'path_to_file\\\\.picasa.ini'])\n\n    # Perform file operations\n    with open('path_to_file\\\\.picasa.ini', 'w') as file:\n        file.write('Your content here')\n\n    # Restore hidden attribute\n    subprocess.call(['attrib', '+H', 'path_to_file\\\\.picasa.ini'])\n    ```\n\n2. **Continue Using 'r+' Mode**: Since 'r+' mode works for your case, you can continue using it. Just ensure you manually truncate the file if needed, as 'r+' does not automatically truncate the file like 'w' does.\n\n3. **Use a Library to Handle File Attributes**: You could use a library like `pywin32` to manipulate file attributes if needed.\n\nIt's important to note that hidden file behavior can vary between different Windows versions and configurations. Always ensure your script has the necessary permissions to access and modify files."
