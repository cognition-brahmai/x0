        "content": "The error you're encountering is because `json.loads()` expects a string, bytes, or bytearray, not a file object. Instead, you should use `json.load()`, which is designed to read and parse JSON data directly from a file object. Here's how you can modify your code to read and extract the `['text']` fields from your JSON file:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Open the JSON file and load its contents\nwith open('C:/Users/bilal butt/Desktop/PanamalEakJson.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as lst:\n    data = json.load(lst)\n\n# Extract and print all 'text' fields\nfor entry in data:\n    print(entry['text'])\n\n# If you want to extract just a single 'text' field, for example, the first one:\nfirst_text = data[0]['text']\nprint(\"First text field:\", first_text)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`json.load(lst)`**: This reads the JSON data from the file object `lst` and parses it into a Python list (since your JSON data is an array of objects).\n- **Looping through `data`**: Since `data` is a list of dictionaries (each dictionary representing a JSON object), you can iterate through each dictionary and access the `['text']` field.\n- **Accessing a specific `['text']` field**: You can directly access a specific entry in the list by its index (e.g., `data[0]['text']` for the first entry).\n\nThis should resolve the error and allow you to extract the `['text']` fields. Make sure your file path is correct and that the JSON file is formatted properly."
