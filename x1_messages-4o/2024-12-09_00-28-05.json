        "content": "The `namedtuple` class from the Python standard library is designed to provide a more efficient and readable way of handling simple, immutable data structures. Here\u2019s how `namedtuples` compare to dictionaries and when you might choose to use one over the other:\n\n### Comparison: namedtuples vs. Dictionaries\n\n1. **Immutability**:\n   - **namedtuple**: Instances are immutable, meaning once they are created, their values cannot be changed. This makes them suitable for representing fixed data structures.\n   - **Dictionary**: Mutable, allowing for modification of values, addition, or removal of items.\n\n2. **Memory Efficiency**:\n   - **namedtuple**: Typically more memory-efficient than dictionaries because they do not have the overhead of storing keys, only values.\n   - **Dictionary**: Generally requires more memory due to the storage of both keys and values.\n\n3. **Access**:\n   - **namedtuple**: Provides attribute-style access, which can make code more readable (e.g., `point.x` instead of `point['x']`).\n   - **Dictionary**: Uses key-based access, which is flexible and allows dynamic addition and removal of key-value pairs.\n\n4. **Use Case**:\n   - **namedtuple**: Ideal for representing simple, fixed structures where immutability is desired, such as coordinates, database records, or any other simple data records.\n   - **Dictionary**: Better suited for scenarios where the dataset is dynamic or may require frequent updates.\n\n### When to Use namedtuple\n\n- Use `namedtuple` when you need a lightweight, immutable data structure with named fields for clarity and readability.\n- Prefer `namedtuple` when you want to ensure that the data structure remains constant throughout its lifecycle.\n- It\u2019s particularly useful for returning multiple values from a function with a clear, self-documenting structure.\n\n### Working with Non-Hashable Types\n\n- `namedtuple` can hold non-hashable types as values since the immutability constraint applies to the structure itself, not the contained values. However, keep in mind that the overall object remains immutable, and you cannot change the values once set.\n- Fields within a `namedtuple` can be of any type, including lists or other mutable data structures, but remember that the `namedtuple` itself is immutable.\n\nIn summary, `namedtuple` is a great choice when you need a fixed, immutable structure with readable fields, while dictionaries offer more flexibility and are better suited for dynamic or frequently changing data."
