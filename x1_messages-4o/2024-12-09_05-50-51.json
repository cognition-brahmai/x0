How do I use introspection in Python 2.5 to list the methods and classes in the modules, along with their associated functions (with argument lists) and classes (with methods and member variables)? I discovered an article about Python introspection, but I'm not certain it's relevant to Python 2.5."

        "content": "Introspection in Python allows you to examine the classes, methods, and attributes of objects. For Python 2.5, you can use several built-in functions and modules to achieve this. Here's a guide on how you can introspect a C library wrapped in Python:\n\n1. **List Modules, Classes, and Methods:**\n   - Use the `dir()` function to list the attributes of a module, class, or object. This will include methods and classes.\n\n   ```python\n   import your_module\n   \n   # List all the attributes of the module\n   print(dir(your_module))\n   ```\n\n2. **Get Details About Classes and Methods:**\n   - Use the `inspect` module, which provides several useful functions to get information about live objects.\n\n   ```python\n   import inspect\n   import your_module\n\n   # Iterate over all attributes of the module\n   for name in dir(your_module):\n       attr = getattr(your_module, name)\n       if inspect.isclass(attr):\n           print(f\"Class: {name}\")\n           # List methods of the class\n           for method_name, method in inspect.getmembers(attr, inspect.ismethod):\n               print(f\"  Method: {method_name} - Args: {inspect.getargspec(method)}\")\n       elif inspect.isfunction(attr):\n           print(f\"Function: {name} - Args: {inspect.getargspec(attr)}\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Get Information About Methods and Functions:**\n   - The `inspect.getargspec()` function (deprecated in Python 3) provides information about the arguments of a function or method.\n\n4. **Inspecting Classes:**\n   - For classes, you can find their methods and attributes by iterating over `dir(class)` and checking each attribute using `inspect.ismethod()` or `inspect.isfunction()`.\n\n5. **Handling Member Variables:**\n   - To find member variables, you can check attributes of the class that are not callable and are not special methods (those starting and ending with `__`).\n\n   ```python\n   class_instance = your_module.YourClass()\n   for attr in dir(class_instance):\n       if not callable(getattr(class_instance, attr)) and not attr.startswith(\"__\"):\n           print(f\"Member variable: {attr}\")\n   ```\n\n6. **Additional Tips:**\n   - Some C extensions may not expose all details in a way that pure Python objects do, so you might find methods without clear argument lists.\n   - Use `help(your_module)` in the Python interactive shell to see if it provides any additional insights.\n\nBy using these tools, you should be able to gather a comprehensive list of classes, methods, and functions along with their argument specifications in a library, even if it's written in C and lacks documentation."
