When I run the code `output = clf.predict_proba(X_input)`, each row in the `output` consists of 2 columns corresponding to the probability of each class. I am unsure if the first column represents the probability of class 0 or 1. According to the predict_proba method of GradientBoostingClassier, \"The class probabilities of the input samples. The order of the classes corresponds to that in the attribute classes_.\" Does this mean that whichever, 0 or 1, is the first element of the data sample corresponds to the first column in the output of `predict_proba`?"

        "content": "Yes, that's correct. In the context of the `predict_proba` method for classifiers like `GradientBoostingClassifier` in scikit-learn, the probabilities for each class are returned in the order specified by the `classes_` attribute of the classifier. This means that if `clf.classes_` returns `[0, 1]`, then the first column of the output from `predict_proba` corresponds to the probability of class 0, and the second column corresponds to the probability of class 1.\n\nTo verify this, you can check the `classes_` attribute of your trained classifier:\n\n```python\nprint(clf.classes_)\n```\n\nThis will print the order of the classes as understood by the classifier. The order of these classes determines the order of the columns in the output of `predict_proba`."
