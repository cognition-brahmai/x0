Below is a step-by-step guide to help you create this component:\n\n1. **Set up your React environment**: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed, and create a new React app using `create-react-app` if you haven't already.\n\n   ```bash\n   npx create-react-app my-app\n   cd my-app\n   ```\n\n2. **Create the component**: Open your project in your favorite code editor and navigate to the `src` directory. You can create a new component file, for example, `TimeButton.js`.\n\n3. **Write the component code**: In `TimeButton.js`, write the following code:\n\n   ```jsx\n   import React, { useState } from 'react';\n\n   const TimeButton = () => {\n     // Declare a state variable to hold the button text\n     const [buttonText, setButtonText] = useState('Click me to get the current time');\n\n     // Function to update the button text with the current time\n     const updateTime = () => {\n       const currentTime = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();\n       setButtonText(currentTime);\n     };\n\n     return (\n       <button onClick={updateTime}>\n         {buttonText}\n       </button>\n     );\n   };\n\n   export default TimeButton;\n   ```\n\n4. **Use the component in your app**: Open `src/App.js` and import your `TimeButton` component. Use it inside the `App` component's return statement:\n\n   ```jsx\n   import React from 'react';\n   import TimeButton from './TimeButton';\n\n   const App = () => {\n     return (\n       <div className=\"App\">\n         <h1>Welcome to the Time Button App</h1>\n         <TimeButton />\n       </div>\n     );\n   };\n\n   export default App;\n   ```\n\n5. **Run your application**: Return to your terminal, and make sure you are in the project directory. Start your React application using the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm start\n   ```\n\n   This will open your default web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`, where you should see your app with a button. Click the button to see it update with the current time.\n\nThis example demonstrates a simple use of React's `useState` hook to manage component state and update the UI dynamically in response to user interactions."
