I am using Python's `ftplib` to write a small FTP client, but some functions in the package do not return string output, they print to stdout instead. I would like to redirect stdout to an object from which I can read the output. I am aware that stdout can be redirected into any regular file with `stdout = open(\"file\", \"a\")`, but I would prefer a method that does not use the local drive. Ideally, I am looking for something similar to the BufferedReader in Java that can be used to wrap a buffer into a stream."

        "content": "Yes, in Python, you can redirect `stdout` to a string buffer using the `io.StringIO` class from the `io` module. This allows you to capture anything that would normally be printed to `stdout` into a string buffer, which can then be read as a string. Here's a simple example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport io\nimport sys\nfrom ftplib import FTP\n\n# Create a StringIO buffer\nbuffer = io.StringIO()\n\n# Save the current stdout so you can restore it later\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n\n# Redirect stdout to the StringIO buffer\nsys.stdout = buffer\n\ntry:\n    # Example: create an FTP instance and perform operations\n    ftp = FTP('ftp.dlptest.com')  # Example public FTP server\n    ftp.login()  # Log in anonymously\n\n    # Perform some FTP operations that print output\n    ftp.retrlines('LIST')  # This will print the directory listing to stdout\n\nfinally:\n    # Restore the original stdout\n    sys.stdout = original_stdout\n\n# Get the contents of the buffer and print it\noutput = buffer.getvalue()\nprint(\"Captured output:\")\nprint(output)\n\n# Close the buffer\nbuffer.close()\n```\n\nIn this example, `sys.stdout` is temporarily redirected to an `io.StringIO` object, which acts like a file object but writes to a string buffer instead of the local file system. After you perform the desired operations, you can restore the original `stdout` and retrieve the output from the buffer using the `getvalue()` method. This approach is particularly useful for capturing printed output without writing to disk."
