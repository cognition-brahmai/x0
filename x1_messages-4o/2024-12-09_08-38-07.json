If so, is there a method to bypass the constructor responsible for this behavior for additional speed? For instance, for some vectors, I don't need them to have an initial value, especially if their raw pointers are being passed to CUBLAS as an output."

        "content": "When creating a new Thrust vector, the default behavior is indeed to initialize all elements to zero. This is because Thrust, a parallel algorithms library which is part of CUDA, aims to provide a high-level interface similar to the C++ Standard Template Library (STL), and this includes default initialization for safety and predictability.\n\nHowever, if you want to bypass this behavior to improve performance (for instance, if you are certain that you will overwrite all elements and thus don't need them initialized), you can do so by using an alternative constructor or method.\n\nHere are a few approaches you might consider:\n\n1. **Using Uninitialized Memory:**\n\n   - You can use `thrust::uninitialized_vector` which behaves like `std::vector`, but does not initialize its elements. This can save you the initialization step if you're sure you'll overwrite all elements before using them.\n\n2. **Custom Memory Allocator:**\n\n   - Implement a custom memory allocator that does not perform initialization. This approach is more advanced and requires a good understanding of allocators in C++.\n\n3. **Raw Pointers with CUBLAS:**\n\n   - If you are passing raw pointers to CUBLAS functions, you can allocate the memory using CUDA memory allocation functions like `cudaMalloc`, and then use a `thrust::device_ptr` to interact with this memory. This way, you control the initialization.\n\nHere is a simple example using `cudaMalloc`:\n\n```cpp\n#include <thrust/device_ptr.h>\n#include <thrust/device_vector.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int N = 1000;\n    float* raw_ptr;\n    cudaMalloc((void**)&raw_ptr, N * sizeof(float));\n    \n    // Now raw_ptr points to uninitialized memory on the device\n    thrust::device_ptr<float> dev_ptr(raw_ptr);\n\n    // Use thrust algorithms on dev_ptr as needed\n    // ...\n\n    // Free the memory after use\n    cudaFree(raw_ptr);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis code allocates memory on the device without initializing it and then wraps it in a `thrust::device_ptr` for use with Thrust algorithms. By doing this, you avoid the default zero-initialization.\n\nAlways ensure that you handle memory management properly to avoid leaks and undefined behavior."
