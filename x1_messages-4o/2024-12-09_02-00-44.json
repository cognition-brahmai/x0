Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nstring1 = \"abc def ghi\"\nstring2 = \"def ghi abc\"\n\n# Split the strings into words\nwords1 = string1.split()\nwords2 = string2.split()\n\n# Sort the lists of words\nsorted_words1 = sorted(words1)\nsorted_words2 = sorted(words2)\n\n# Compare the sorted lists\nare_equal = sorted_words1 == sorted_words2\n\nprint(\"The strings are the same (ignoring word order):\", are_equal)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1. We use the `split()` method to break each string into a list of words.\n2. We then sort these lists of words using the `sorted()` function.\n3. Finally, we compare the sorted lists. If they are equal, it means the strings contain the same words, regardless of the order."
