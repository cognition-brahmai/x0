The code I'm currently using is as follows:\n\n```python\nfig = plt.figure(num=None, figsize=(26, 12), dpi=80, facecolor='w', edgecolor='k')\nfig.canvas.set_window_title('Window Title')\n\n# Returns the Axes instance\nax = fig.add_subplot(311) \nax2 = fig.add_subplot(312) \nax3 = fig.add_subplot(313) \n```\n\nI know that `fig.suptitle` adds a title to the whole figure and `ax.set_title()` should add a title to a subplot. However, when I use `ax.set_title()`, it doesn't seem to add any title to my subplots. Could you please help me solve this issue?"

        "content": "To add a unique title to each subplot in Matplotlib, you need to use the `set_title()` method on each Axes object. It seems like you're on the right track, but let's ensure you're applying it correctly. Here's an example of how you can add titles to your subplots:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nfig = plt.figure(num=None, figsize=(26, 12), dpi=80, facecolor='w', edgecolor='k')\nfig.canvas.manager.set_window_title('Window Title')\n\n# Create subplots\nax1 = fig.add_subplot(311) \nax2 = fig.add_subplot(312) \nax3 = fig.add_subplot(313) \n\n# Set a unique title for each subplot\nax1.set_title('Title for Subplot 1')\nax2.set_title('Title for Subplot 2')\nax3.set_title('Title for Subplot 3')\n\n# If you want to display the plot\nplt.tight_layout()  # Adjusts the subplot params so that the subplots fit into the figure area\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- Ensure you are using `ax1`, `ax2`, and `ax3` to call `set_title()`, as each represents a different subplot.\n- `plt.tight_layout()` is used to automatically adjust the subplot parameters to give specified padding, which helps in making sure titles and labels are not overlapping.\n- Make sure you are calling `plt.show()` to actually render the plot and see your changes.\n\nWith this setup, you should see each subplot with its respective title. If you still don't see the titles, double-check your environment to ensure there are no errors or issues with how the plot is being rendered."
