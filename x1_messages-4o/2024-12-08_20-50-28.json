        "content": "To evaluate the expression `1 << 2 + 3 >> 4 & 5 ^ 6`, let's break it down step by step, considering operator precedence and associativity. \n\n1. **Bitwise Shift Operators and Addition:**\n   - The expression `1 << 2 + 3` involves a left shift (`<<`) and addition (`+`). According to operator precedence, addition is evaluated first.\n   - `2 + 3` equals `5`.\n   - Then, `1 << 5` means shifting the binary representation of `1` to the left by 5 positions, which results in `32` (binary `100000`).\n\n2. **Bitwise Right Shift:**\n   - Now we have `32 >> 4`.\n   - `32` in binary is `100000`. Shifting it right by 4 positions gives `2` (binary `10`).\n\n3. **Bitwise AND:**\n   - Next, evaluate `2 & 5`.\n   - `2` in binary is `10`, and `5` in binary is `101`.\n   - Performing a bitwise AND operation gives `0` (binary `000`).\n\n4. **Bitwise XOR:**\n   - Finally, we have `0 ^ 6`.\n   - `0` in binary is `0`, and `6` in binary is `110`.\n   - Performing a bitwise XOR operation gives `6` (binary `110`).\n\nTherefore, the result of the expression `1 << 2 + 3 >> 4 & 5 ^ 6` is `6`."
