Can someone advise on which library should I include to use the `sqrt` function?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the `sqrt` function from the standard C math library is a host function, and it cannot be called from a device or global function in CUDA. To resolve this issue, you should use the CUDA math library's device version of the `sqrt` function. CUDA provides its own set of device functions that can be used within CUDA kernels.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use the CUDA-specific `sqrtf` function for single-precision floating-point numbers:\n\n```c\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n#include <device_launch_parameters.h>\n#include <math_functions.h> // This header includes all the CUDA math functions\n\n__global__ void square(float *myArrayGPU)\n{\n   myArrayGPU[threadIdx.x] = sqrtf(threadIdx.x);\n}\n```\n\nIn this modified code:\n- We included `math_functions.h`, which is part of the CUDA Toolkit and provides device-compatible math functions.\n- We used `sqrtf` instead of `sqrt` to make sure we are calling the correct device version of the function for single-precision floats. If you were working with double-precision values, you would use `sqrt`.\n\nMake sure your CUDA Toolkit is properly installed and your build system is configured to compile CUDA code. This usually involves using `nvcc`, the NVIDIA CUDA Compiler."
