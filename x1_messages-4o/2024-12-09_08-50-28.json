        "content": "Certainly! To determine if a year is a leap year in Python, you can follow these rules:\n\n1. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.\n2. However, if the year is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year, unless:\n3. The year is also divisible by 400, then it is a leap year.\n\nHere's a simple Python program that implements this logic:\n\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year):\n    if (year % 4 == 0):\n        if (year % 100 == 0):\n            if (year % 400 == 0):\n                return True\n            else:\n                return False\n        else:\n            return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Example usage\nyear = int(input(\"Enter a year: \"))\nif is_leap_year(year):\n    print(f\"{year} is a leap year.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"{year} is not a leap year.\")\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `is_leap_year` that takes a year as input and returns `True` if it's a leap year and `False` otherwise. You can test it by entering different years to see if it correctly identifies leap years."
