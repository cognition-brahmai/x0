However, if either of these keys is not present in the JSON object, a KeyError exception is raised. How can I identify which key caused this exception?"

        "content": "To determine which key caused the `KeyError` exception in your code, you can use the exception object's arguments. The `KeyError` exception provides the missing key as its argument, which you can access in the `except` block. Here's how you can modify your code to capture and log the specific key that is missing:\n\n```python\ndef poijson2xml(location_node, POI_JSON):\n    try:\n        man_json = POI_JSON[\"FastestMan\"]\n        woman_json = POI_JSON[\"FastestWoman\"]\n    except KeyError as e:\n        # e.args[0] contains the key that caused the KeyError\n        missing_key = e.args[0]\n        LogErrorMessage(\"POIJSON2XML\", f\"Can't find mandatory key '{missing_key}' in JSON\")\n\n# Example usage of LogErrorMessage function\ndef LogErrorMessage(function_name, message):\n    print(f\"Error in {function_name}: {message}\")\n\n# Example JSON object\nPOI_JSON_example = {\n    # \"FastestMan\": \"Usain Bolt\",  # Uncomment to test without error\n    \"FastestWoman\": \"Florence Griffith-Joyner\"\n}\n\n# Calling the function\npoijson2xml(None, POI_JSON_example)\n```\n\nIn this updated code, the `KeyError` exception is caught as `e`, and `e.args[0]` gives you the key that caused the exception. You can use this information to provide more specific error messages or handle the error accordingly."
