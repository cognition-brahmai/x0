The desired output is [\"238\",\"NEO Sports\"]. I've considered using the split() function and finally merging the last two strings returned. Is there a more efficient way to achieve this?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this more efficiently by using the `split()` method with the `maxsplit` parameter. The `maxsplit` parameter allows you to specify the maximum number of splits you want to perform. By setting `maxsplit=1`, you can split the string only at the first space. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nstring = \"238 NEO Sports\"\nresult = string.split(' ', 1)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will give you the desired output:\n\n```\n['238', 'NEO Sports']\n```\n\nBy using `split(' ', 1)`, the string is split at the first occurrence of a space, and the rest of the string remains intact, which is exactly what you want."
