        "content": "The error you're encountering is a known issue with `pip` due to an incompatibility between certain versions of `pip`, `requests`, and `urllib3`. Specifically, the issue arises from a mismatch in versions that leads to a `TypeError` in the `Retry` handling logic.\n\nHere's how you can fix it:\n\n### Step 1: Upgrade `pip`, `setuptools`, and `wheel`\n\nUpdating `pip` and its dependencies can often resolve these issues. Run the following commands to upgrade `pip`, `setuptools`, and `wheel`:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install python-pip\nsudo pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel\n```\n\n### Step 2: Reinstall `urllib3` and `requests`\n\nSometimes, reinstalling `urllib3` and `requests` can help resolve the issue. You can do this by running:\n\n```bash\nsudo pip uninstall urllib3 requests\nsudo pip install urllib3 requests\n```\n\n### Step 3: Use a virtual environment (Recommended)\n\nIf you're still facing issues, consider using a virtual environment. This isolates your project's dependencies and can prevent such conflicts. Here\u2019s how you can create a virtual environment:\n\n1. Install `virtualenv` if it's not already installed:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo pip install virtualenv\n   ```\n\n2. Create a new virtual environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   virtualenv myenv\n   ```\n\n3. Activate the virtual environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n4. Now, try installing your packages within this virtual environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\n### Step 4: Check Python version compatibility\n\nEnsure that the version of `pip` you are using is compatible with Python 2.7, as some newer versions have dropped support for Python 2. If necessary, you might need to install an older version of `pip` that supports Python 2.7:\n\n```bash\nsudo pip install pip==19.1.1\n```\n\nThis should help you resolve the issue. If problems persist, consider upgrading your Python version, as Python 2.7 is no longer supported and may lead to compatibility issues with newer packages."
