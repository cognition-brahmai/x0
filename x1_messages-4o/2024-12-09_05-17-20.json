I've tried using 'model.input_size.weight' on my model but it returns an error that says 'Sequential' object has no attribute 'input_size'. My current code is as follows:\n\n```python\ninput_size = 784\nhidden_sizes = [128, 64]\noutput_size = 10\n\n# Build a feed-forward network\nmodel = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_sizes[0]),\n                      nn.ReLU(),\n                      nn.Linear(hidden_sizes[0], hidden_sizes[1]),\n                      nn.ReLU(),\n                      nn.Linear(hidden_sizes[1], output_size),\n                      nn.Softmax(dim=1))\n```"

        "content": "In PyTorch, `nn.Sequential` is a convenient container module that allows you to define a network in a compact and readable way. However, it doesn't provide attribute access to the individual sub-modules by name, like `model.input_size`. Instead, you can access the layers by index.\n\nTo access the weights of each layer in your `nn.Sequential` model, you can use the index of the layer. Here's how you can do it for your specific model:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\ninput_size = 784\nhidden_sizes = [128, 64]\noutput_size = 10\n\n# Build a feed-forward network\nmodel = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_sizes[0]),\n                      nn.ReLU(),\n                      nn.Linear(hidden_sizes[0], hidden_sizes[1]),\n                      nn.ReLU(),\n                      nn.Linear(hidden_sizes[1], output_size),\n                      nn.Softmax(dim=1))\n\n# Access the weights of the first Linear layer\nfirst_layer_weights = model[0].weight\nprint(first_layer_weights)\n\n# Access the weights of the second Linear layer\nsecond_layer_weights = model[2].weight\nprint(second_layer_weights)\n\n# Access the weights of the third Linear layer\nthird_layer_weights = model[4].weight\nprint(third_layer_weights)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `model[0]` accesses the first `nn.Linear` layer.\n- `model[2]` accesses the second `nn.Linear` layer.\n- `model[4]` accesses the third `nn.Linear` layer.\n\nRemember, indexes are based on the order in which layers are added to the `nn.Sequential` container. Non-weight layers like `nn.ReLU()` do not have weights, so they can be skipped when accessing weights."
