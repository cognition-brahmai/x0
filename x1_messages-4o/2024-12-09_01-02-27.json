Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Specify the path to the directory you want to set as the current working directory\nnew_directory = '/path/to/your/directory'\n\n# Change the current working directory\nos.chdir(new_directory)\n\n# Verify the change\nprint(\"Current working directory:\", os.getcwd())\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `'/path/to/your/directory'` with the actual path of the directory you want to set as the current working directory. After executing this code, any file operations you perform will be relative to this new directory."
