I have already tried converting using the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\npath = Path('foo')\npath.touch()\nstatResult = path.stat()\nepoch = datetime(1970, 1, 1, tzinfo=timezone.utc)\nmodified = epoch + timedelta(seconds=statResult.st_mtime)\nprint('modified', modified)\n```\n\nHowever, this method seems roundabout and it's surprising that I have to hard code the Unix epoch in there. Is there a more direct way to achieve this?"

        "content": "Yes, there is a more direct and idiomatic way to convert the modification time from a `stat()` call to a `datetime` object in Python. The `datetime` module provides a convenient method called `fromtimestamp()` that can be used for this purpose. This method converts a timestamp directly into a `datetime` object, and you can also specify the time zone if needed. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timezone\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\npath = Path('foo')\npath.touch()\nstatResult = path.stat()\n\n# Use fromtimestamp to convert the modification time directly\nmodified = datetime.fromtimestamp(statResult.st_mtime, tz=timezone.utc)\nprint('modified', modified)\n```\n\nThis approach avoids the need to manually define the Unix epoch and use `timedelta`, making the code cleaner and more idiomatic."
