We can represent this data in the form of an excel table as shown below:\n|   x   |   y   |   z   |\n|-------|-------|-------|\n|   1   |   2   |   7   |\n|   3   |   4   |   22  |\n|   5   |   6   |   43  |\n|   7   |   8   |   ?   |\nWe can see that the first three rows of data fit the equation 3x + 4y = z perfectly. However, the fourth row is missing the value of z. What is the value of z for the fourth row, given that it also fits the equation?\nThe equation 3x + 4y = z can be rearranged as z = 3x + 4y. Using this formula, we can calculate the missing value of z for the fourth row:\nz = 3(7) + 4(8) = 21 + 32 = 53\nTherefore, the missing value of z in the fourth row is 53."
