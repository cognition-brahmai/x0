I installed these modules via easy_install in the terminal without encountering any error messages. When I run Python from a terminal and use import mahotas and import pymorph, it works just fine without any error messages. But, when I run the same lines from a script within Spyder, I get an error: \"ImportError: No module named pymorph\". It seems like Spyder is using a separate install of Python and installing modules via the terminal only installs them to the system version of Python. How can I add these modules to Spyder? I'm using Mac OSX 10.7.4 and Spyder 2.1.9."

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely due to Spyder using a different Python environment than the one where you installed the modules. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Python Environment in Spyder**: \n   - Open Spyder and go to `Tools > Preferences`.\n   - Under the `Python interpreter` section, check which interpreter path is being used by Spyder. This will tell you which Python environment Spyder is using.\n\n2. **Install Modules in the Correct Environment**:\n   - If Spyder is using a different Python environment than your system's default, you'll need to install the modules in that specific environment.\n   - To do this, first locate the Python executable used by Spyder. You can find this in the preferences as mentioned above.\n   - Open a terminal and use the path to the Python executable to install the modules. For example:\n     ```bash\n     /path/to/spyder/python -m pip install mahotas pymorph\n     ```\n   - This ensures that the modules are installed in the environment used by Spyder.\n\n3. **Using Anaconda (if applicable)**:\n   - If you installed Spyder via Anaconda, make sure you're installing the packages in the Anaconda environment:\n     ```bash\n     conda install mahotas pymorph\n     ```\n   - This will ensure that the modules are available in the Anaconda environment that Spyder is using.\n\n4. **Virtual Environments (if applicable)**:\n   - If you are using virtual environments, activate the environment that Spyder is using before installing the modules:\n     ```bash\n     source /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate\n     pip install mahotas pymorph\n     ```\n\n5. **Restart Spyder**:\n   - After installing the modules, restart Spyder to ensure that it picks up the newly installed packages.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the ImportError and use the `mahotas` and `pymorph` modules in Spyder."
