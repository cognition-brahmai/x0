However, when I run the code `driver = webdriver.Chrome()`, I encounter an error `WebDriverException: Message: Service chromedriver unexpectedly exited. Status code was: 127`. What does this error mean and how can I resolve it? I am using a terminal-only setup because I wasn't able to get a GUI boot on my Ubuntu desktop. Also, I have installed ssh and I am remotely controlling a Jupyter notebook from my Mac to the server desktop."

        "content": "The error message `WebDriverException: Message: Service chromedriver unexpectedly exited. Status code was: 127` typically indicates that the `chromedriver` executable is not found or not executable. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify Chromedriver Path**: Ensure that the `chromedriver` is installed and its path is correctly set in your environment. You might want to specify the path explicitly in your code:\n\n   ```python\n   from selenium import webdriver\n\n   options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()\n   options.add_argument('--headless')  # Run in headless mode since you are on a server without a GUI\n   options.add_argument('--no-sandbox')  # Bypass OS security model\n   options.add_argument('--disable-dev-shm-usage')  # Overcome limited resource problems\n\n   driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='/path/to/chromedriver', options=options)\n   ```\n\n   Replace `/path/to/chromedriver` with the actual path to the `chromedriver` executable.\n\n2. **Check Permissions**: Make sure that the `chromedriver` file has the correct permissions to be executed. You can set the execute permission using:\n\n   ```bash\n   chmod +x /path/to/chromedriver\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Missing Libraries**: The status code 127 may also indicate that some required shared libraries are missing. You can try installing them with:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install -y libxpm4 libxrender1 libgtk2.0-0 libnss3 libgconf-2-4\n   ```\n\n4. **Use Headless Mode**: Since you are running on a server without a GUI, ensure you are using headless mode with Chromium:\n\n   ```python\n   options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()\n   options.add_argument('--headless')\n   options.add_argument('--no-sandbox')\n   options.add_argument('--disable-dev-shm-usage')\n   ```\n\n5. **Check Chromedriver Compatibility**: Ensure the version of `chromedriver` matches the version of Chromium you have installed. You can check the version of Chromium with:\n\n   ```bash\n   chromium-browser --version\n   ```\n\n   And download the compatible version of `chromedriver` from [here](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/).\n\n6. **Install Latest Versions**: Sometimes, simply updating to the latest version of both Chromium and Chromedriver can resolve compatibility issues:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install -y chromium-browser\n   wget -N https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/$(curl -sS chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/LATEST_RELEASE)/chromedriver_linux64.zip\n   unzip chromedriver_linux64.zip\n   sudo mv chromedriver /usr/local/bin/\n   ```\n\n7. **Reboot the Server**: After making these changes, it's often a good idea to reboot the server to ensure all changes take effect properly.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error and successfully run your Selenium web crawler on Ubuntu 17.10."
