        "content": "To parallelize the processing of each row in a Pandas DataFrame, you can use the `concurrent.futures` module, which provides a high-level interface for asynchronously executing callables. Here's how you can modify your code to use `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`:\n\n1. Define a function that processes a single row.\n2. Use `ThreadPoolExecutor` to parallelize the execution of this function across multiple rows.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor\nimport concurrent.futures\n\ndef process_row(row):\n    idx = row[0]\n    k = row[1]['Chromosome']\n    start, end = map(int, row[1]['Bin'].split('-'))\n\n    sequence = sequence_from_coordinates(k, 1, start, end)  # slow download from http\n\n    gc_percent = gc_content(sequence, percent=False, verbose=False)\n    g4_repeats = sum([len(list(i)) for i in g4_scanner(sequence)])\n    max_flexibility = max([item[1] for item in dna_flex(sequence, verbose=False)])\n    \n    return idx, gc_percent, g4_repeats, max_flexibility\n\ndef update_dataframe(df, results):\n    for idx, gc_percent, g4_repeats, max_flexibility in results:\n        df.at[idx, 'GC%'] = gc_percent\n        df.at[idx, 'G4 repeats'] = g4_repeats\n        df.at[idx, 'max flexibility'] = max_flexibility\n\n# Make sure you have an appropriate number of workers\nnum_workers = 4\n\nwith ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=num_workers) as executor:\n    futures = {executor.submit(process_row, row): row for row in df.iterrows()}\n    \n    results = []\n    for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):\n        results.append(future.result())\n\nupdate_dataframe(df, results)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Function Definition:** `process_row` is defined to handle the processing of a single row. It returns the results needed to update the DataFrame.\n\n2. **Using ThreadPoolExecutor:** \n   - A `ThreadPoolExecutor` is created with a specified number of workers (`num_workers`).\n   - `executor.submit(process_row, row)` is used to submit the `process_row` function for each row, which allows them to be processed in parallel.\n   - `concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures)` is used to collect the results as they complete.\n\n3. **Updating the DataFrame:** Once all tasks are complete, the DataFrame is updated using the `update_dataframe` function.\n\n### Considerations:\n- **I/O Bound Task:** Since `sequence_from_coordinates` involves a slow HTTP request, using threads (as opposed to processes) is generally more efficient for I/O-bound tasks.\n- **Adjusting `num_workers`:** The number of workers should be chosen based on your system's capabilities and the nature of the task.\n\nThis approach allows you to parallelize the row processing while efficiently updating your DataFrame."
