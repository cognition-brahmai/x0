You need to group by both the index (`user_id`) and the column (`item_bought`) and then use the `size` method to get the count of items for each user. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'user_id': [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1],\n    'item_bought': ['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'apple', 'banana', 'orange']\n}\n\n# Create the DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Group by 'user_id' and 'item_bought' and get the count\nitem_count = df.groupby(['user_id', 'item_bought']).size().reset_index(name='count')\n\nprint(item_count)\n```\n\nIn this example, the data is grouped first by `user_id` and then by `item_bought`. The `size` method is used to count the occurrences, and `reset_index` is used to convert the resulting series back into a DataFrame with a column named `count`. The resulting DataFrame `item_count` will have each combination of `user_id` and `item_bought` along with the count of items bought by each user."
