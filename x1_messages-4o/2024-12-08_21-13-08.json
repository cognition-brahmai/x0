The username should only be added to the usernames array if it's not already included.

        "content": "The starter code you provided already does a good job of generating unique usernames by randomly combining words from `finance_words` and `tech_words`. However, there are a few ways to make the code slightly more efficient or clean:\n\n1. **Use a Set**: Using a `Set` instead of an array for `usernames` can improve performance when checking for duplicates, as lookups are generally faster with sets.\n\n2. **Pre-compute All Combinations**: Instead of randomly selecting and checking for uniqueness, you can precompute all possible combinations and then shuffle and select the required number of unique usernames.\n\nHere's how you can implement these improvements:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'set'\n\nfinance_words = [\"capital\", \"wealth\", \"fund\", \"asset\", \"investment\"]\ntech_words = [\"tech\", \"cyber\", \"code\", \"data\", \"robot\"]\nusernames = Set.new\n\nall_combinations = finance_words.product(tech_words).map { |pair| pair.join }\n\n# Shuffle the array of all combinations\nall_combinations.shuffle!\n\n# Select the first 10 unique usernames\nusernames.merge(all_combinations.take(10))\n\nputs usernames.to_a\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n- **Use of `Set`**: A `Set` is used to store the `usernames`, which ensures uniqueness and potentially offers faster lookups than an array.\n\n- **Precompute Combinations**: `finance_words.product(tech_words)` generates all possible combinations of words from the two arrays, and `map` is used to join the pairs into strings.\n\n- **Shuffle and Select**: The combinations are shuffled to ensure randomness and the first 10 are selected. This avoids the while loop and multiple random selections.\n\nThis approach ensures that you generate unique usernames efficiently without unnecessary iterations."
