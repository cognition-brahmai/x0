After upgrading to Python 2.7.3 and installing pip, I installed these modules but Python does not seem to pick them up when I try importing them. How can I set the path so that Python also looks at the site-packages directory in usr/local/lib, where all of my pip installs are being installed?"

        "content": "To resolve the issue of Python not recognizing the modules you've installed via pip on Mountain Lion, you need to ensure that the path where pip installs packages is included in Python's search path. Here\u2019s how you can do that:\n\n1. **Check Installation Path**:\n   First, confirm where the packages are being installed. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:\n   ```bash\n   pip show pyserial\n   ```\n   This command will display information about the package, including its location. Look for the `Location` field to verify where the package is installed.\n\n2. **Modify PYTHONPATH**:\n   If the packages are installed in a directory not included in Python's default search path, you can add this directory to the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable. This can be done by adding the following line to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, or `.zshrc`, depending on your shell):\n   ```bash\n   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages\n   ```\n   Make sure to replace `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages` with the actual path you found using the `pip show` command, if it differs.\n\n3. **Reload the Shell Configuration**:\n   After modifying the shell configuration file, you need to reload it to apply the changes. You can do this by running:\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bash_profile\n   ```\n   Replace `.bash_profile` with the appropriate file you edited, such as `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.\n\n4. **Verify Python Path**:\n   To ensure that the path has been added correctly, you can check Python\u2019s search paths by starting Python and printing `sys.path`:\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   print(sys.path)\n   ```\n   Verify that the path to your site-packages directory is included in this list.\n\n5. **Check Python Version**:\n   Make sure you are using the same version of Python that pip is installing packages for. You can check the Python version by running:\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   ```\n   Ensure it matches the version for which you installed the packages.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to import pySerial and feedparser successfully in your Python scripts. If you still encounter issues, consider reinstalling the modules or checking for any specific error messages that might provide further clues."
