        "content": "To determine the installed version of the `lxml` package, you can use a few different methods. Since the `lxml` module itself does not expose a `__version__` attribute directly, you can use one of the following methods:\n\n1. **Using `pkg_resources` from `setuptools`:**\n\n   This method works if `setuptools` is installed on your system.\n\n   ```python\n   import pkg_resources\n\n   version = pkg_resources.get_distribution(\"lxml\").version\n   print(version)\n   ```\n\n2. **Using `pip` command:**\n\n   You can use the `pip` command to list the installed packages along with their versions.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip show lxml\n   ```\n\n   This will display information about the `lxml` package, including its version.\n\n3. **Using `importlib.metadata` (Python 3.8+):**\n\n   If you're using Python 3.8 or later, you can use the `importlib.metadata` module to find the version:\n\n   ```python\n   from importlib.metadata import version\n\n   lxml_version = version(\"lxml\")\n   print(lxml_version)\n   ```\n\n4. **Using `conda` (if using Anaconda):**\n\n   If you installed `lxml` using Anaconda, you can use the following command to check the version:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda list lxml\n   ```\n\nAny of these methods should help you determine the version of the `lxml` package installed on your system."
