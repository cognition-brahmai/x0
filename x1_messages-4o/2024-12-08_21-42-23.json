        "content": "To calculate the probability of drawing a card from a standard deck of 52 cards that has a value of exactly two or a suit of spades using Scala, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of favorable outcomes.\n2. Calculate the total number of possible outcomes.\n3. Compute the probability.\n\nHere's a Scala code snippet to perform these calculations:\n\n```scala\nobject CardProbabilityCalculator {\n  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\n    // Total number of cards in a standard deck\n    val totalCards = 52\n\n    // Cards with a value of two (one from each suit)\n    val valueOfTwoCards = 4\n\n    // Cards with a suit of spades (one for each rank)\n    val spadeCards = 13\n\n    // Cards that are both value two and spades\n    val twoOfSpades = 1\n\n    // Calculate the number of favorable outcomes\n    val favorableOutcomes = valueOfTwoCards + spadeCards - twoOfSpades\n\n    // Calculate the probability\n    val probability = favorableOutcomes.toDouble / totalCards\n\n    // Print the result\n    println(f\"The probability of drawing a card that is either a two or a spade is $probability%.4f\")\n  }\n}\n\nCardProbabilityCalculator.main(Array.empty)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Total Cards:** There are 52 cards in a standard deck.\n- **Value of Two Cards:** There are four cards with the value of two (one for each suit: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades).\n- **Spade Cards:** There are 13 spade cards (one for each rank from Ace to King).\n- **Two of Spades:** Since the two of spades is counted in both the value of two cards and the spade cards, it is subtracted once to avoid double-counting.\n\nThe probability is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output the probability of drawing a card that is either a two or a spade from a standard deck of cards."
