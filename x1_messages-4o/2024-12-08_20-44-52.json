Each subdomain is composed of alphanumeric characters and hyphens, ending with a dot.\n- `[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\\.io` - Matches the main domain which should end in \".io\".\n- `(\\/[^\\s]*)?$` - Matches an optional path that starts with a \"/\" and contains any character except whitespace, until the end of the string.\n\nThis pattern ensures that the URI has at least one subdomain and ends with \".io\". Adjust the pattern according to specific needs if necessary."
