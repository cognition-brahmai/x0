When I delete conftest.py, cmdopt cannot be found when running test_conf.py, which is in the same directory. Why isn't sonoftest.py searched? Here is my code for reference:\n\nFor test_sample.py:\n```python\ndef test_answer(cmdopt):\n    if cmdopt == \"type1\":\n        print (\"first\")\n    elif cmdopt == \"type2\":\n        print (\"second\")\n    assert 0 # to see what was printed\n```\n\nFor conftest.py:\n```python\nimport pytest\n\ndef pytest_addoption(parser):\n    parser.addoption(\"--cmdopt\", action=\"store\", default=\"type1\",\n        help=\"my option: type1 or type2\")\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef cmdopt(request):\n    return request.config.getoption(\"--cmdopt\")\n```\n\nAnd for sonoftest.py:\n```python\nimport pytest\n\ndef pytest_addoption(parser):\n    parser.addoption(\"--cmdopt\", action=\"store\", default=\"type1\",\n        help=\"my option: type1 or type2\")\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef cmdopt(request):\n    return request.config.getoption(\"--cmdopt\")\n```\n\nAccording to the documentation, pytest finds the test function due to the test_ prefix and the test function needs a matching fixture function. But I'm having trouble understanding why it's not finding the cmdopt fixture when I delete conftest.py."

        "content": "In pytest, fixtures are a way to set up some context or state needed by tests. The way pytest discovers fixtures and other setup code is through a mechanism involving special files and naming conventions.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation of your situation:\n\n1. **Fixture Discovery**:\n   - Pytest looks for fixtures in the following order:\n     1. **Conftest.py files**: These are special configuration files pytest automatically recognizes and loads. They can be placed at any level in your test directory hierarchy, and pytest will find them automatically. Fixtures defined in a `conftest.py` are available to all tests in that directory and its subdirectories.\n     2. **Test Modules**: If a fixture is not found in a `conftest.py`, pytest will look in the test module where the test is located.\n     3. **Plugins**: Pytest can also discover fixtures provided by installed plugins.\n\n2. **Your Scenario**:\n   - When you have `conftest.py` in the directory, pytest finds `cmdopt` there because `conftest.py` is meant to provide fixtures and hooks globally within the directory.\n   - When you delete `conftest.py`, pytest cannot find the `cmdopt` fixture in `sonoftest.py` because `sonoftest.py` is considered just another test module, not a fixture provider like `conftest.py`.\n\n3. **Why `sonoftest.py` Isn't Searched**:\n   - Pytest does not automatically search other test modules (like `sonoftest.py`) for fixtures unless they are explicitly imported. Test modules are expected to contain tests, not fixture definitions meant for use by other modules.\n   - To use the `cmdopt` fixture from `sonoftest.py`, you would need to import it explicitly in `test_sample.py` if `conftest.py` is not present.\n\n4. **Solution**:\n   - Keep `cmdopt` in `conftest.py` if you want it available to all tests in the directory.\n   - Alternatively, if you want to keep it in `sonoftest.py`, import it in `test_sample.py` like this:\n     ```python\n     from sonoftest import cmdopt\n     ```\n\nRemember that `conftest.py` is the preferred location for shared fixtures because it is automatically discovered by pytest and does not require explicit imports."
