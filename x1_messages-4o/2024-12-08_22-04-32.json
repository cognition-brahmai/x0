        "content": "Certainly! Below is a Java code snippet that demonstrates how you might go about detecting the rarest strain of bacteria based on antibiotic resistance and mortality rate. This is a simplified approach and assumes you have some predefined data about bacterial strains.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.*;\n\nclass BacteriaStrain {\n    String name;\n    int antibioticResistanceLevel; // Higher number means more resistant\n    double mortalityRate; // Percentage of mortality\n    int rarityScore; // Lower number means rarer\n\n    BacteriaStrain(String name, int antibioticResistanceLevel, double mortalityRate, int rarityScore) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.antibioticResistanceLevel = antibioticResistanceLevel;\n        this.mortalityRate = mortalityRate;\n        this.rarityScore = rarityScore;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return \"BacteriaStrain{name='\" + name + '\\'' +\n                \", antibioticResistanceLevel=\" + antibioticResistanceLevel +\n                \", mortalityRate=\" + mortalityRate +\n                \", rarityScore=\" + rarityScore +\n                '}';\n    }\n}\n\npublic class BacteriaAnalysis {\n\n    public static BacteriaStrain findRarestStrain(List<BacteriaStrain> strains) {\n        return Collections.min(strains, Comparator.comparingInt(strain -> strain.rarityScore));\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        List<BacteriaStrain> strains = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(\n                new BacteriaStrain(\"StrainA\", 5, 0.12, 3),\n                new BacteriaStrain(\"StrainB\", 7, 0.22, 5),\n                new BacteriaStrain(\"StrainC\", 3, 0.08, 1),\n                new BacteriaStrain(\"StrainD\", 6, 0.15, 4)\n        ));\n\n        BacteriaStrain rarestStrain = findRarestStrain(strains);\n        System.out.println(\"The rarest bacterial strain is: \" + rarestStrain);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **BacteriaStrain Class**: Represents a bacterial strain with attributes such as name, antibiotic resistance level, mortality rate, and rarity score.\n- **findRarestStrain Method**: Uses Java's `Collections.min` method with a custom comparator to find the strain with the lowest rarity score, which represents the rarest strain.\n- **Main Method**: Demonstrates the creation of a list of `BacteriaStrain` objects and finds the rarest strain based on the rarity score.\n\nYou can modify the attributes and logic based on the specifics of your dataset and the criteria for determining rarity."
