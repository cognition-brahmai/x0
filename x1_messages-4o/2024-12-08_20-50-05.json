Gathering all necessary information is the foundation for any successful project. This sets the stage for all subsequent steps.\n\n2. **friendB()**: Once the research is complete, organizing and planning based on the gathered information is crucial. This will provide structure and direction for the project.\n\n3. **friendC()**: With a plan in place, execute it. As obstacles arise, problem-solving skills are essential to keep the project on track.\n\n4. **friendD()**: After overcoming obstacles, bring in creative thinking to enhance the project with innovative solutions. This step can also be iterative with problem-solving if new challenges emerge.\n\n5. **friendE()**: Finally, effectively communicate and present the final product. This ensures that the project is well-received by the intended audience or stakeholders.\n\nThis order leverages each friend's strengths at the appropriate stage of the project for optimal results."
