        "content": "In Matplotlib, you can control the order in which plots are drawn using the `zorder` parameter. By increasing the `zorder` of the scatter plot, you can ensure that it is drawn on top of other plots, such as your contour plot.\n\nHere's an example of how you can do this:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Sample data\nx = np.random.rand(50)\ny = np.random.rand(50)\n\n# Create a contour plot\nX, Y = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(0, 1, 100), np.linspace(0, 1, 100))\nZ = np.sin(X * 10) * np.cos(Y * 10)\nplt.contourf(X, Y, Z, cmap='viridis', alpha=0.5)\n\n# Create a scatter plot with a higher zorder\nplt.scatter(x, y, color='red', zorder=3)\n\nplt.xlabel('X-axis')\nplt.ylabel('Y-axis')\nplt.title('Scatter plot on top of contour plot')\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this example, the scatter plot is assigned a `zorder` of 3, which places it above the contour plot, which has the default `zorder` of 1. You can adjust the `zorder` values as needed to control the layering of different plot elements."
