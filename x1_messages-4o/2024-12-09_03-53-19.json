Can someone help me understand why this is happening and how I can fix it?"

        "content": "The overflow error you're encountering is due to the large magnitude of the number you're using in the `np.exp` function. The exponential function grows very rapidly, and when you pass a large negative number like -1234.1 to `np.exp`, it results in a very small number that is effectively zero for practical purposes, but the computation itself can cause numerical instability leading to an overflow warning.\n\nIn your specific case, you're trying to compute the sigmoid function which is defined as:\n\n\\[ \\text{sigmoid}(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \\]\n\nFor very large positive numbers, `e^{-x}` becomes very small, which is fine, but for very large negative numbers, `e^{-x}` becomes very large, which is what is causing the overflow.\n\nTo handle this, you can use the `np.clip` function to limit the values of `cc` to avoid passing extremely large negative numbers to the `np.exp` function. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ncc = np.array([\n    [0.120, 0.34, -1234.1]\n])\n\n# Clip values to prevent overflow in exp\ncc_clipped = np.clip(cc, -500, 500)\n\n# Compute the sigmoid function\nsigmoid_output = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-cc_clipped))\n\nprint(sigmoid_output)\n```\n\nIn this code, `np.clip` limits the values in `cc` to be between -500 and 500, which is a safe range to prevent overflow in the exponential calculation while still providing accurate sigmoid outputs."
