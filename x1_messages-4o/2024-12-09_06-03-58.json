        "content": "In Python, `True` is a built-in constant and modifying it can lead to unexpected behavior. However, in the interactive mode or scripts, you can accidentally overwrite built-in constants and functions. There isn't a direct way to restore `True` to its original state within the same interactive session once it's been reassigned, because `True` is not imported from a module but is a built-in constant.\n\nTo reset `True` to its original state, you have a few options:\n\n1. **Restart the Interactive Session**: The simplest way is to restart the Python interactive session. This will reset all variables and imports, restoring `True` to its proper value.\n\n2. **Use `del` Statement**: You might use the `del` statement to remove the local assignment, allowing Python to fall back to the built-in constant:\n\n   ```python\n   del True\n   ```\n\n   Once you delete the reassignment, `True` should behave as expected again.\n\n3. **Avoid Reassigning Built-ins**: As a preventive measure, try to avoid reassigning built-in constants and functions in practice. To avoid such issues, it's good practice to use variable names that are unlikely to clash with built-in names.\n\nIn general, redefining built-in constants or functions is not recommended, as it can lead to confusing and hard-to-debug code."
