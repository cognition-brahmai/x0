I want to utilize a pretrained model like Inception v3 (trained on the 2012 ImageNet dataset) and expand it by adding several missing categories. The examples like transfer learning on flowers work well, but they strip away the final layer and remove all 1,000 existing categories. This means that the model can now identify 5 species of flowers, but it can no longer identify other categories like pandas. I want to add these 5 flower categories to the existing 1,000 categories from ImageNet and train the model for these 5 new flower categories, resulting in 1,005 categories that a test image can be classified as. I had an idea of setting the parameter fine_tune to false when retraining with the 5 flower categories so that the final layer is not stripped. But I'm not sure how to proceed and not sure if this would even result in a valid model with 1,005 categories. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To expand a pretrained Inception v3 model to recognize additional categories while retaining its ability to classify the original categories, you need to modify the model architecture and training approach slightly. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Load the Pretrained Model:**\n   First, load the Inception v3 model pretrained on ImageNet without the top classification layer. This allows you to add a new classification layer with the desired number of categories.\n\n   ```python\n   from tensorflow.keras.applications import InceptionV3\n   from tensorflow.keras.models import Model\n   from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D\n\n   base_model = InceptionV3(weights='imagenet', include_top=False)\n   ```\n\n2. **Add a New Classification Layer:**\n   Add a new dense layer for classification with 1,005 categories (1,000 original + 5 new categories).\n\n   ```python\n   x = base_model.output\n   x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)\n   x = Dense(1024, activation='relu')(x)\n   predictions = Dense(1005, activation='softmax')(x)\n   model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)\n   ```\n\n3. **Freeze the Base Model Layers:**\n   To retain the learned weights of the original categories, freeze the layers of the base model. This will ensure that the original features remain unchanged during training on the new dataset.\n\n   ```python\n   for layer in base_model.layers:\n       layer.trainable = False\n   ```\n\n4. **Compile the Model:**\n   Compile the model with an appropriate optimizer and loss function.\n\n   ```python\n   model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])\n   ```\n\n5. **Prepare Your Data:**\n   Prepare your data by ensuring you have a dataset with labels for all 1,005 categories. This includes the original ImageNet labels and your new categories. You might need to create a custom label mapping.\n\n6. **Train the New Classification Layer:**\n   Train only the new classification layer with your dataset.\n\n   ```python\n   # Assuming `train_generator` is a data generator that yields batches of images and labels\n   model.fit(train_generator, epochs=10, validation_data=validation_generator)\n   ```\n\n7. **Fine-Tuning (Optional):**\n   If the new categories require fine-tuning of some of the deeper layers, you can unfreeze some layers in the base model and retrain.\n\n   ```python\n   for layer in base_model.layers[:249]:  # Example: Unfreeze from 249th layer onwards\n       layer.trainable = False\n   for layer in base_model.layers[249:]:\n       layer.trainable = True\n\n   model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])\n   model.fit(train_generator, epochs=5, validation_data=validation_generator)\n   ```\n\n8. **Evaluation:**\n   Finally, evaluate your model on a test set to ensure that it can accurately classify images into any of the 1,005 categories.\n\nThis approach allows you to extend the capabilities of a pretrained model by preserving the original weights and adding new categories. Adjust the number of epochs and layers to unfreeze based on the complexity of your new categories and the amount of data available."
