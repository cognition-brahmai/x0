        "content": "To correctly add type hints to your Python function while avoiding the error you're encountering, you should ensure that you are importing the `pandas` module and using the correct alias if you've given it one. In your code, you've imported `pandas` as `pd`, so you should use `pd.DataFrame` as the type hint for the return value. Here's how you should modify your function with the appropriate type hints:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef csv_to_df(path: str) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    return pd.read_csv(path, skiprows=1, sep='\\t', comment='#')\n```\n\nBy using `pd.DataFrame`, you are referencing the `DataFrame` class correctly from the `pandas` module using the alias `pd` that you've defined. This should resolve the error and correctly apply type hints to your function."
