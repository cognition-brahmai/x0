For example,\n```python\nfrom pandas import DataFrame\n\ndf1 = DataFrame({'key': ['b', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'b'],\n                 'data1': range(7)})\n\ndf1.data1\n```\nThis returns the series for me. However, when the column name contains a space, I can't access it the same way:\n```python\nfrom pandas import DataFrame\n\ndf2 = DataFrame({'key': ['a','b','d'],\n                 'data 2': range(3)})\n\ndf2.data 2      # <- not working.\n```\nI know I can access it using .xs():\n```python\ndf2.xs('data 2', axis=1)\n```\nBut I'm looking for a better way to do this. Is there any other method to access a pandas column with a name that contains spaces?"

        "content": "When you have a column name with spaces in a pandas DataFrame, you can't access it using the dot notation (e.g., `df.column_name`) because it's not a valid Python attribute name. However, you can easily access such columns using square brackets. Here are a few different methods to access a column with spaces in its name:\n\n1. **Using Square Brackets:**\n   ```python\n   df2['data 2']\n   ```\n\n2. **Using `.loc` or `.iloc`:**\n   ```python\n   df2.loc[:, 'data 2']\n   ```\n\n3. **Using `.at` or `.iat` for single values:**\n   If you know the index of the row you want, you can access a specific value:\n   ```python\n   df2.at[0, 'data 2']  # Accesses the value in the first row of 'data 2' column\n   ```\n\n4. **Using `.get()`:**\n   This is a less common method but works similarly to accessing a dictionary:\n   ```python\n   df2.get('data 2')\n   ```\n\nThe most common and straightforward approach is to use the square brackets method, which allows you to handle any column name regardless of spaces or special characters."
