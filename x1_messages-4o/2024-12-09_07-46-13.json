For example, given the two dictionaries:\n```python\nd1 = {'a': 2, 'b': 8, 'c': ''}\nd2 = {'a': 2, 'b': '', 'c': ''}\n```\nI want to merge them in such a way that the result is `{'a': 2, 'b': 8, 'c': ''}`, where the value `8` for key `'b'` in `d1` is not overwritten by the empty string in `d2`."

        "content": "To merge the two dictionaries with the specified behavior, you can iterate through the keys and update the first dictionary only if the value in the second dictionary is not empty or if the corresponding value in the first dictionary is empty. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n```python\ndef merge_dictionaries(d1, d2):\n    merged = d1.copy()  # Start with a copy of the first dictionary\n    for key, value in d2.items():\n        if value is not None and value != '':\n            merged[key] = value\n        elif merged.get(key) in (None, ''):  # Only update if d1's value is empty\n            merged[key] = value\n    return merged\n\n# Example usage\nd1 = {'a': 2, 'b': 8, 'c': ''}\nd2 = {'a': 2, 'b': '', 'c': ''}\n\nresult = merge_dictionaries(d1, d2)\nprint(result)  # Output: {'a': 2, 'b': 8, 'c': ''}\n```\n\nThis function works by creating a copy of the first dictionary, `d1`, and then iterating through the second dictionary, `d2`. It updates the value in the `merged` dictionary only if the value from `d2` is non-empty or if the corresponding value in `d1` is empty. This ensures that non-empty values in `d1` are not overwritten by empty values from `d2`."
