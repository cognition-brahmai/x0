        "content": "To sort a basket of mixed nuts based on their density using a single measuring device, you can creatively leverage the principles of buoyancy and Archimedes' principle. Here's an approach using Python:\n\n### Concept:\nYou can use water and a measuring device (like a scale or a graduated cylinder) to determine the density of each nut. The idea is to use water displacement to measure volume and a scale to measure weight, allowing you to calculate density.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Weigh Each Nut**: Use a scale to measure the weight of each nut in grams.\n\n2. **Measure Volume via Water Displacement**:\n   - Fill a graduated cylinder with a known volume of water.\n   - Submerge the nut in the water and measure the new water level.\n   - The difference in water level gives you the volume of the nut in cubic centimeters (cm\u00b3).\n\n3. **Calculate Density**: Use the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Density} = \\frac{\\text{Mass}}{\\text{Volume}}\n   \\]\n   where mass is in grams and volume is in cubic centimeters.\n\n4. **Group Nuts Based on Density**: Use conditional statements to categorize nuts into the specified density groups.\n\n### Python Code:\n\n```python\nclass Nut:\n    def __init__(self, weight, volume):\n        self.weight = weight\n        self.volume = volume\n        self.density = self.calculate_density()\n\n    def calculate_density(self):\n        return self.weight / self.volume\n\ndef categorize_nuts(nuts):\n    group1 = []\n    group2 = []\n    group3 = []\n    group4 = []\n\n    for nut in nuts:\n        if nut.density < 0.5:\n            group1.append(nut)\n        elif 0.5 <= nut.density < 1.0:\n            group2.append(nut)\n        elif 1.0 <= nut.density < 1.5:\n            group3.append(nut)\n        else:\n            group4.append(nut)\n    \n    return group1, group2, group3, group4\n\n# Example usage:\n# Suppose you have a list of nuts, each with a measured weight and volume\nnuts = [\n    Nut(weight=5, volume=15),\n    Nut(weight=10, volume=10),\n    Nut(weight=15, volume=10),\n    Nut(weight=20, volume=10)\n]\n\ngroup1, group2, group3, group4 = categorize_nuts(nuts)\n\nprint(\"Group 1 (Density < 0.5):\", [nut.density for nut in group1])\nprint(\"Group 2 (0.5 <= Density < 1.0):\", [nut.density for nut in group2])\nprint(\"Group 3 (1.0 <= Density < 1.5):\", [nut.density for nut in group3])\nprint(\"Group 4 (Density >= 1.5):\", [nut.density for nut in group4])\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Weight and Volume**: You measure each nut's weight and volume, and then calculate its density.\n- **Categorization**: Based on the calculated density, nuts are sorted into four groups.\n- **Flexibility**: Adjust the weights and volumes in the example to fit your specific nuts.\n\nThis approach efficiently uses water displacement to measure volume, allowing for density calculation and nut categorization without needing multiple complex devices."
