When I try to retrieve details such as the request.headers['User-Agent'], a KeyError is raised because Flask's test_client() doesn't seem to set these up. The error I'm encountering is as follows:\n\n```\nFile \"/Users/me/app/rest/app.py\", line 515, in login\n    if request.headers['User-Agent']:\nFile \"/Users/me/.virtualenvs/app/lib/python2.7/site-packages/werkzeug/datastructures.py\", line 1229, in __getitem__\n    return self.environ['HTTP_' + key]\n    KeyError: 'HTTP_USER_AGENT'\n```\nHow can I set or mock the User-Agent for Flask app unit tests?"

        "content": "To mock or set the `User-Agent` header in Flask's test client during unit testing, you can pass custom headers when making requests with the test client. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Set Up Your Flask Test Case:**\n\n   First, ensure you have a Flask test case set up. Typically, this involves creating a subclass of `unittest.TestCase` and setting up your application and test client.\n\n2. **Use Custom Headers with the Test Client:**\n\n   You can use the `headers` parameter in the test client methods like `get()`, `post()`, etc., to specify custom headers, including `User-Agent`.\n\nHere's an example of how you can set the `User-Agent` header for a test request:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\nfrom your_flask_app import app  # Import your Flask app\n\nclass YourTestCase(unittest.TestCase):\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Set up the test client\n        self.app = app.test_client()\n        self.app.testing = True\n\n    def test_with_user_agent(self):\n        # Define the custom User-Agent\n        headers = {\n            'User-Agent': 'MyCustomUserAgent/1.0'\n        }\n        \n        # Make a request with the custom User-Agent header\n        response = self.app.get('/your_endpoint', headers=headers)\n        \n        # Your test assertions here\n        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)\n        # Add more assertions as needed\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\nIn this example, replace `'/your_endpoint'` with the actual endpoint you're testing. The `headers` dictionary allows you to specify any custom headers you want to include in the request. This should prevent the `KeyError` by ensuring that the `User-Agent` header is present in the request."
