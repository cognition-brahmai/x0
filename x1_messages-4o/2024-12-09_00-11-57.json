The development and extraction of these resources, particularly through techniques like hydraulic fracturing (fracking), have significantly boosted the U.S. energy sector. This abundance has played a crucial role in the country's economy by making the U.S. one of the largest producers of oil and natural gas in the world. It has also influenced international trade relations, as the U.S. has transitioned from being a major importer of these resources to becoming a significant exporter, impacting global energy markets and geopolitics."
