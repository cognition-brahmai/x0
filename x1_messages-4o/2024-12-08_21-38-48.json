        "content": "Let's denote the two prime numbers as \\( p \\) and \\( q \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the product of the two prime numbers is equal to the sum of their squares:\n\n\\[ pq = p^2 + q^2 \\]\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to:\n\n\\[ pq - p^2 - q^2 = 0 \\]\n\nNow, factor the left-hand side:\n\n\\[ (p - q)^2 = 0 \\]\n\nThis implies that \\( p = q \\). However, since \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are prime numbers, the only way they can be equal is if \\( p = q = 2 \\). But 2 is the only even prime number, and the sum of two identical prime numbers (4 in this case) is not a prime number.\n\nThus, let's consider another approach for odd primes. If \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are distinct primes, then neither can be 2, because their sum needs to be a prime number.\n\nLet's try the smallest odd primes: 3 and 5.\n\n1. Check if their product equals the sum of their squares:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 5 = 15\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3^2 + 5^2 = 9 + 25 = 34\n   \\]\n\nThis condition does not hold. Let's try another pair: 3 and 7.\n\n1. Check their product and the sum of their squares:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 7 = 21\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3^2 + 7^2 = 9 + 49 = 58\n   \\]\n\nAgain, this does not satisfy the condition. Let's try with 5 and 7.\n\n1. Check their product and the sum of their squares:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 7 = 35\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   5^2 + 7^2 = 25 + 49 = 74\n   \\]\n\nThis condition does not hold either. Let\u2019s try 3 and 11.\n\n1. Check their product and the sum of their squares:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 11 = 33\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3^2 + 11^2 = 9 + 121 = 130\n   \\]\n\nThis condition does not hold. Finally, let's try 5 and 13:\n\n1. Check their product and the sum of their squares:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 13 = 65\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   5^2 + 13^2 = 25 + 169 = 194\n   \\]\n\nThis doesn't work either. \n\nUpon re-evaluation, it seems the correct approach is to first ensure the sum of two distinct primes is a prime. Let's try another pair: 3 and 17.\n\n1. Check their product and the sum of their squares:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 17 = 51\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3^2 + 17^2 = 9 + 289 = 298\n   \\]\n\nThis does not satisfy the condition. \n\nIt seems an oversight has occurred in interpreting the problem. Let\u2019s evaluate for smaller primes once more. \n\nAfter testing several combinations, it becomes apparent that the problem setup might not lead to a straightforward solution with small primes, and could involve a different approach or constraints not completely addressed in typical small prime sets. \n\nPast attempts are not yielding expected conditions. Re-evaluation with different constraints or under different assumptions might be necessary for a valid solution. \n\nIn conclusion, based on the information and attempts, no small distinct pair of odd primes immediately satisfies the apparent conditions as isolated. Further analysis with broader constraints might be needed."
