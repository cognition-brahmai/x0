controllers that save water by adapting to weather conditions.  \n   *Sources*: [Rachio](https://rachio.com)\n\n5. **Drip Irrigation**  \n   *Description*: Delivers water directly to the plant's roots, minimizing evaporation and runoff.  \n   *Example*: Widely used in agricultural sectors and home gardens in arid regions.  \n   *Sources*: [Drip Irrigation Basics](https://www.rainbird.com)\n\n6. **Dual-Flush Toilets**  \n   *Description*: Toilets with two flush options, half-flush for liquid waste and full-flush for solid waste.  \n   *Example*: Common in Europe and Australia, these toilets can save up to 67% of water usage.  \n   *Sources*: [Dual-Flush Toilets](https://www.build.com)\n\n7. **Aerated Faucets**  \n   *Description*: Mixes air with water to maintain pressure while reducing flow.  \n   *Example*: Aerated faucets can reduce water usage by up to 50% without compromising performance.  \n   *Sources*: [Energy Saving Trust](https://energysavingtrust.org.uk)\n\n8. **Pressure Reducing Valves**  \n   *Description*: Reduces the water pressure entering a building, thereby reducing water flow and leakage.  \n   *Example*: Installation in high-pressure areas can lead to significant water savings.  \n   *Sources*: [Water Pressure Reducing Valves](https://www.plumbingsupply.com)\n\n9. **Artificial Turf and Xeriscaping**  \n   *Description*: Replacing natural grass with synthetic turf or drought-resistant plants to reduce irrigation needs.  \n   *Example*: Popular in drought-prone areas, such as Southern California.  \n   *Sources*: [Xeriscaping](https://www.eartheasy.com)\n\n10. **Leak Detection Systems**  \n    *Description*: Automated systems that alert users to leaks in plumbing systems.  \n    *Example*: Systems like Flo by Moen can detect leaks and shut off water supply to prevent wastage.  \n    *Sources*: [Flo by Moen](https://meetflo.com)\n\n11. **Water-Efficient Landscaping**  \n    *Description*: Designing landscapes to minimize water use through plant selection and efficient irrigation.  \n    *Example*: Implementing native plant gardens that require less water.  \n    *Sources*: [Water-Efficient Landscaping](https://www.epa.gov)\n\n12. **Stormwater Management Systems**  \n    *Description*: Systems designed to capture and reuse stormwater for irrigation and other non-potable uses.  \n    *Example*: Green roofs and permeable pavements in urban areas help manage stormwater effectively.  \n    *Sources*: [Sustainable Stormwater](https://www.epa.gov)\n\n13. **High-Efficiency Washing Machines**  \n    *Description*: Machines that use less water per cycle compared to standard models.  \n    *Example*: ENERGY STAR certified washers can save significant amounts of water and energy.  \n    *Sources*: [ENERGY STAR](https://www.energystar.gov)\n\n14. **Composting Toilets**  \n    *Description*: Toilets that treat human waste through composting, eliminating the need for water.  \n    *Example*: Used in eco-friendly homes and remote locations.  \n    *Sources*: [Composting Toilets](https://www.greenamerica.org)\n\n15. **Hot Water Recirculation Systems**  \n    *Description*: Systems that provide instant hot water at fixtures, reducing the need to run water until hot.  \n    *Example*: Systems like those offered by Grundfos can save thousands of gallons per year.  \n    *Sources*: [Grundfos](https://www.grundfos.com)\n\n16. **Water Audits**  \n    *Description*: Assessing water use to identify areas of waste and opportunities for efficiency improvements.  \n    *Example*: Many large corporations conduct regular water audits to improve sustainability.  \n    *Sources*: [Water Audit Guide](https://www.awwa.org)\n\n17. **Behavioral Changes and Education**  \n    *Description*: Educating residents and employees about water conservation practices to reduce wastage.  \n    *Example*: Campaigns and workshops in communities and workplaces can lead to significant behavioral shifts.  \n    *Sources*: [Water Education](https://www.projectwet.org)\n\n18. **Water-Saving Appliances**  \n    *Description*:
