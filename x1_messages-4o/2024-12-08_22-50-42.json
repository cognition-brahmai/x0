Can you match each theory/model with its description? \n| Theory/Model | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Geocentric | A theory that suggests the Earth is at the center of the universe |\n| Heliocentric | A theory that suggests the Sun is at the center of the universe |\n| Newtonian | A model that describes gravity as a force between two objects with mass |\n| General Relativity | A theory that describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy |\nNow, let's move on to the next level of this puzzle game. Can you explain in straightforward terms the current scientific consensus on gravity and how it relates to other fundamental forces in nature? Here's a hint: it involves the concept of quantum mechanics. Good luck!"

        "content": "Sure! The current scientific consensus on gravity is primarily based on Albert Einstein's theory of General Relativity. In straightforward terms, General Relativity describes gravity not as a traditional force, but as a result of the curvature of spacetime. Imagine spacetime as a flexible fabric. Massive objects, like planets and stars, cause this fabric to curve, and other objects move along these curves, which we perceive as gravitational attraction.\n\nHowever, gravity is just one of the four fundamental forces in nature, the others being electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force. While General Relativity beautifully describes gravity on large scales (like stars, galaxies, and the universe), quantum mechanics is the framework we use to understand the other three forces, especially at very small scales (like atoms and subatomic particles).\n\nThe puzzle that scientists are working on is how to reconcile these two frameworks\u2014General Relativity and quantum mechanics\u2014because they don't currently integrate smoothly. This is why researchers are exploring a theory of quantum gravity, which aims to describe gravity at the quantum level, potentially unifying it with the other fundamental forces. Some theories, like string theory or loop quantum gravity, are attempts to bridge this gap, but a complete and universally accepted theory of quantum gravity hasn't been established yet."
