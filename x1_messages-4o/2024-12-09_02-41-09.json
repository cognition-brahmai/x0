The model is used for predicting time series data but on recreating the model, I get significantly different results on the same training and testing data. The code I used is as follows:\n\n```python\n# fix random\nimport random\nrandom.seed(42)\n\n# make model & compile\nmodel = Sequential([\n    LSTM(50, input_shape=(None, 1), return_sequences=True),\n    LSTM(100, return_sequences=False),\n    Dense(1),\n    Activation(\"linear\")\n])\nmodel.compile(loss=\"mse\", optimizer=\"rmsprop\")\n\n# save it and its initial random weights\nmodel_json = model.to_json()\nmodel.save_weights(\"model.h5\")\n\n# fit and predict\nmodel.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=3)\nr = model.predict(x_test)\n\n# create new \"identical\" model\nmodel2 = model_from_json(model_json)\nmodel2.load_weights(\"model.h5\")\nmodel2.compile(loss=\"mse\", optimizer=\"rmsprop\")\n\n# fit and predict \"identical\" model\nmodel2.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=3)\nr2 = model2.predict(x_test)\n\n# ...different results :(\n```\n\nI've tried to fix the randomness by using the following code:\n\n```python\nimport random\nrandom.seed(42)\nimport numpy\nnumpy.random.seed(42)\nfrom tensorflow import set_random_seed\nset_random_seed(42)\n```\n\nBut the results are still not consistent. What could be the source of this variability?"

        "content": "The variability in results when recreating an identical Keras LSTM model, even after trying to set seeds and saving/loading model configurations and weights, can be attributed to several factors. Here are some potential causes and solutions to ensure reproducibility:\n\n1. **Random Seeds**: While you have set seeds for Python's `random`, NumPy, and TensorFlow, make sure to set seeds immediately after importing libraries and before any model-related operations. Also, confirm that you are using the correct functions for setting random seeds, especially in TensorFlow 2.x, where you should use `tensorflow.random.set_seed(42)`.\n\n2. **Environment**: Ensure your environment is consistent. Differences in library versions, CUDA/cuDNN versions (if using GPU), or even operating system differences can lead to variations. Use a virtual environment or Docker to maintain consistency.\n\n3. **Session and Graph**: In TensorFlow 1.x, you might need to set up a fixed session and graph. However, this is less of an issue with TensorFlow 2.x, which uses eager execution by default.\n\n4. **Model Initialization**: Ensure that the model's weights are initialized identically. Saving and loading weights should handle this, but if there's any discrepancy in how the weights are initialized or loaded, it could cause issues.\n\n5. **Training Order**: Check that the order of data is consistent. If your data is shuffled differently between runs, it could affect results. Set a seed for any shuffling or use deterministic data pipelines.\n\n6. **Multi-threading**: Disable any randomness in multi-threading operations by setting `PYTHONHASHSEED` and configuring your operations to use a single thread if necessary.\n\n7. **Hardware Variations**: Subtle differences in floating-point arithmetic between different hardware can lead to variability. This is usually minor but can accumulate over time, especially in deep learning models.\n\nHere's a refined approach for setting up your Python environment for reproducibility:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport random\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Set environment variables\nos.environ['PYTHONHASHSEED'] = '0'\nos.environ['TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS'] = '1'\n\n# Set seeds\nrandom.seed(42)\nnp.random.seed(42)\ntf.random.set_seed(42)\n\n# Make sure to import and set seeds before any other operations\n```\n\nIn addition to this setup, ensure that any other operations in your script that could introduce randomness are controlled and deterministic. With these practices, you should see more consistent results from your models."
