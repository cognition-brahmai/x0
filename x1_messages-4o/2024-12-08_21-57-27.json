Read the existing JSON file into a MATLAB structure.\n2. Convert the new entries into a MATLAB structure.\n3. Append the new structure to the existing structure.\n4. Write the combined structure back to a JSON file.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you might do this in MATLAB:\n\n```matlab\n% Read existing JSON file\nfilename = 'animals.json'; % Your existing JSON file\nfid = fopen(filename, 'r');\nraw = fread(fid, inf);\nstr = char(raw');\nfclose(fid);\nexistingData = jsondecode(str);\n\n% New animals to add\nnewAnimals = [\n   struct(\"name\", \"Archerfish\", \"description\", \"The archerfish can shoot jets of water to knock insects off branches, demonstrating remarkable precision and accuracy.\", \"habitat\", \"Mangroves and estuaries in Southeast Asia\"),\n   struct(\"name\", \"Star-Nosed Mole\", \"description\", \"The star-nosed mole has a distinctive star-shaped nose with 22 fleshy appendages, which are used to detect prey through touch.\", \"habitat\", \"Wet lowland areas in North America\"),\n   struct(\"name\", \"Leaf-Tailed Gecko\", \"description\", \"The leaf-tailed gecko has an extraordinary camouflage ability with its leaf-like tail, helping it to blend into its forest environment.\", \"habitat\", \"Forests of Madagascar\"),\n   struct(\"name\", \"Saiga Antelope\", \"description\", \"The saiga antelope has a large, humped nose that filters out dust and regulates blood temperature during extreme weather conditions.\", \"habitat\", \"Grasslands and semi-deserts of Central Asia\"),\n   struct(\"name\", \"Dumbo Octopus\", \"description\", \"The dumbo octopus has ear-like fins that give it a unique appearance and allow it to swim gracefully in the deep sea.\", \"habitat\", \"Deep ocean floors around the world\"),\n   struct(\"name\", \"Pangolin\", \"description\", \"The pangolin is covered in protective keratin scales and can curl into a ball to defend against predators.\", \"habitat\", \"Forests and savannas of Africa and Asia\")\n];\n\n% Append new animals to existing data\ncombinedData = [existingData; newAnimals];\n\n% Write combined data back to JSON file\njsonStr = jsonencode(combinedData);\nfid = fopen(filename, 'w');\nif fid == -1\n    error('Cannot open file for writing: %s', filename);\nend\nfwrite(fid, jsonStr, 'char');\nfclose(fid);\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `'animals.json'` with the path to your actual JSON file. This example assumes that your JSON file is formatted correctly and contains an array of JSON objects."
