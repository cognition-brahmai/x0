        "content": "To modify your Matplotlib plot to use hollow square markers instead of solid ones, you can change the marker style in your plot command. In Matplotlib, you can specify different marker styles using specific symbols. For hollow squares, you can use `'ks'` for solid squares and `'ks'` with `markerfacecolor='none'` to make them hollow.\n\nHere's how you can modify your current command:\n\n```python\npylab.semilogy(xaxis, pq_averages, 'ks-', color='black', markerfacecolor='none', label='DCTCP-PQ47.5')\n```\n\nThis change will draw hollow square markers on your plot. The `'ks'` specifies black square markers, and `'markerfacecolor='none'`' makes the inside of the markers transparent (hollow). The rest of your command remains unchanged, ensuring you still have a solid line connecting the markers."
