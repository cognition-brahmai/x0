The line_profiler works with iPython, but it doesn't work with Jupyter Notebook. I tried adding @profile to my function, but it gives an error saying 'profile' is not defined. I know one way to do this is by using time.time(), but I'm wondering if there is any built-in profiling function available that can profile each line of my function and show me the execution time. Here's the function I'm trying to profile:\n\n```python\ndef prof_function():\n    x=10*20\n    y=10+x\n    return (y)\n```"

        "content": "To profile your Python code line by line in a Jupyter Notebook, you can use the `line_profiler` package, which is compatible with Jupyter Notebooks. First, you need to ensure that `line_profiler` is installed and then use the `%lprun` magic command to profile your functions.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to using `line_profiler` in Jupyter Notebook:\n\n1. **Install `line_profiler`:**\n\n   You can install `line_profiler` using pip. Run the following command in a Jupyter Notebook cell:\n\n   ```python\n   !pip install line_profiler\n   ```\n\n2. **Load `line_profiler` extension in Jupyter Notebook:**\n\n   Load the `line_profiler` extension using `%load_ext` magic command:\n\n   ```python\n   %load_ext line_profiler\n   ```\n\n3. **Use `%lprun` to profile your function:**\n\n   Use the `%lprun` magic command to profile your function. You need to specify the function you want to profile using the `-f` option. Here's how you can do it with your `prof_function`:\n\n   ```python\n   def prof_function():\n       x = 10 * 20\n       y = 10 + x\n       return y\n\n   # Run line profiler\n   %lprun -f prof_function prof_function()\n   ```\n\nThe `%lprun` magic command will output the time taken for each line of your function to execute, giving you a detailed line-by-line profile.\n\n**Note:** If you encounter issues with `%lprun`, make sure that the function is defined in the same notebook cell or in a cell above where you're calling `%lprun`. Also, ensure the `line_profiler` extension is properly loaded."
