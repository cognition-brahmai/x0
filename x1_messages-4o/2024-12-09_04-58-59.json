However, post an update using `conda update --all`, it started giving me a ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity. The error occurred when I added 'hue' to the scatterplot. What could be the reason for this error and how can I resolve it? Below is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nimport seaborn as sns; sns.set()\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ntips = sns.load_dataset(\"tips\")\n\n# this works:\nax = sns.scatterplot(x=\"total_bill\", y=\"tip\", data=tips)\n\n# But adding 'hue' gives the error below:\nax = sns.scatterplot(x=\"total_bill\", y=\"tip\", hue=\"time\", data=tips)\n```\n\nThe error is as follows:\n\n```shell\nValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity\n```\n\nI am running python on a Linux machine with following versions:\n```shell\nPandas:  1.1.0.\nNumpy:   1.19.1.\nSeaborn api:  0.10.1.\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is likely due to an incompatibility or a bug introduced after updating your packages. The \"zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity\" error typically occurs when a function that requires non-empty arrays is provided with an empty array. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Data Consistency:**\n   - Ensure that the `tips` dataset is loading correctly and that it contains the expected columns without any missing values. You can do this by printing out the dataset:\n     ```python\n     print(tips.head())\n     print(tips.info())\n     ```\n\n2. **Package Compatibility:**\n   - There might be a compatibility issue between different packages you've updated. Verify if the issue persists with the combination of versions you have. Sometimes, downgrading to a previous version that was known to work can resolve the issue.\n\n3. **Update Seaborn:**\n   - Check if there's a newer version of Seaborn available, as newer releases often contain bug fixes. Since your version is 0.10.1 and Seaborn updates periodically, consider updating it:\n     ```bash\n     conda update seaborn\n     ```\n\n4. **Minimal Reproduction:**\n   - Create a minimal script to see if the error persists. Sometimes isolating the problem can help identify whether it's specific to your environment or code.\n\n5. **Alternative Visualizations:**\n   - As a temporary workaround, try using `hue` with a different column that you know for sure has no missing values, or use a different visualization library to see if the issue is specific to Seaborn.\n\n6. **Check for Open Issues:**\n   - Look at Seaborn's GitHub repository for any open issues related to this error. It's possible that other users have experienced the same problem, and there might be a fix or workaround suggested.\n\n7. **Revert to Previous Environment:**\n   - If the above steps do not resolve the issue, consider reverting your environment to a state before the update, if you have a backup or can recreate it with specific package versions.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, sharing the specific versions of all related libraries (including Matplotlib) and any additional context (e.g., changes in the dataset) might help in diagnosing the problem further."
