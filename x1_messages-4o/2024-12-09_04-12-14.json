Consequently, the x and y labels are too close to each other to be useful. I'm creating a list of xticks and yticks to use. However, passing this list to the function rotates the labels in the plot. How can I have the yticks upright or have Seaborn automatically drop some of the ticks?\n\nHere's my code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\n\ndata = pd.DataFrame(np.random.normal(size=40*40).reshape(40,40))\n\nyticks = data.index\nkeptticks = yticks[::int(len(yticks)/10)]\nyticks = ['' for y in yticks]\nyticks[::int(len(yticks)/10)] = keptticks\n\nxticks = data.columns\nkeptticks = xticks[::int(len(xticks)/10)]\nxticks = ['' for y in xticks]\nxticks[::int(len(xticks)/10)] = keptticks\n\nsns.heatmap(data,linewidth=0,yticklabels=yticks,xticklabels=xticks)\n```\n\nAnd here's the resulting plot:\n\n![Resulting plot](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gt6bR.png)"

        "content": "To modify the rotation of tick labels in a Seaborn heatmap, you can use the `plt.xticks()` and `plt.yticks()` functions from Matplotlib, which allow you to set the rotation of the tick labels after you've created your heatmap. You can specify the rotation angle to make the labels more readable. Here's how you can adjust your code to achieve the desired effect:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndata = pd.DataFrame(np.random.normal(size=40*40).reshape(40,40))\n\nyticks = data.index\nkeptticks = yticks[::int(len(yticks)/10)]\nyticks = ['' for y in yticks]\nyticks[::int(len(yticks)/10)] = keptticks\n\nxticks = data.columns\nkeptticks = xticks[::int(len(xticks)/10)]\nxticks = ['' for y in xticks]\nxticks[::int(len(xticks)/10)] = keptticks\n\n# Create the heatmap\nsns.heatmap(data, linewidth=0, yticklabels=yticks, xticklabels=xticks)\n\n# Rotate the x and y tick labels\nplt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')  # Rotate x tick labels to 45 degrees\nplt.yticks(rotation=0)  # Keep y tick labels upright\n\n# Show plot\nplt.tight_layout()  # Adjust layout to fit the rotated labels\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')`:** This rotates the x-axis labels by 45 degrees and adjusts their horizontal alignment to the right. You can change the angle to whatever suits your visualization best.\n- **`plt.yticks(rotation=0)`:** This keeps the y-axis labels upright.\n\nBy using these adjustments, you maintain clarity in your label presentation even when there are many labels on the axes. Adjust the angles and alignment as needed to fit your specific data and visualization needs."
