When the element is present, my code works fine, but it fails when the element is not there. I'm trying to implement an exception handling which lets my script continue to the next statement even if the element is not present. Here's the code I'm using:\n\n```python\ntry:\n   elem = driver.find_element_by_xpath(\".//*[@id='SORM_TB_ACTION0']\")\n   elem.click()\nexcept nosuchelementexception:\n   pass\n```\n\nHowever, I am still encountering this error:\n\n```python\nselenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException: Message: Unable to locate element:{\"method\":\"xpath\",\"selector\":\".//*[@id='SORM_TB_ACTION0']\"}\n```\n\nHow can I correctly handle this exception to ensure my script doesn't fail when the element is not present?"

        "content": "To handle the `NoSuchElementException` properly in your Selenium automation script, you need to make sure you are catching the exception correctly. It seems like there might be a small typo in your exception handling block. The exception name should be correctly specified, and you also need to import the exception class from Selenium.\n\nHere's a corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nfrom selenium.common.exceptions import NoSuchElementException\n\ntry:\n    elem = driver.find_element_by_xpath(\".//*[@id='SORM_TB_ACTION0']\")\n    elem.click()\nexcept NoSuchElementException:\n    # Element is not found, so we catch the exception and pass\n    pass\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Import the Exception**: Ensure you import `NoSuchElementException` from `selenium.common.exceptions`.\n\n2. **Correct Exception Name**: Double-check the exception name to make sure it is spelled and capitalized correctly (`NoSuchElementException`).\n\n3. **Pass Statement**: The `pass` statement in the `except` block ensures that your script continues execution without any interruption if the element is not found.\n\nBy following these adjustments, your script should handle the absence of the element gracefully, allowing it to proceed to the next operations without any issues."
