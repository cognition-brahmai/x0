How can I successfully sum the list that contains 'None'? Here is the code I have been using:\n\n```python\ndef sumImport(self):\n    my_list = [[1,2,3,None],[1,2,3],[1,1],[1,1,2,2]]\n    k = sum(chain.from_iterable(my_list))\n    return k\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the presence of `None` in your list, which cannot be directly summed with integers. To handle this situation, you need to filter out the `None` values before performing the sum operation. You can use a list comprehension to achieve this. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import chain\n\ndef sumImport():\n    my_list = [[1, 2, 3, None], [1, 2, 3], [1, 1], [1, 1, 2, 2]]\n    # Filter out None values and sum the remaining numbers\n    k = sum(x for x in chain.from_iterable(my_list) if x is not None)\n    return k\n\n# Call the function\nresult = sumImport()\nprint(result)  # Output: 19\n```\n\nThis updated code uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate over the flattened list, only summing values that are not `None`. This should resolve the `TypeError` and give you the correct sum of all numbers in the list."
