        "content": "Yes, you can apply the Nearest Neighbors algorithm using a precomputed distance matrix in Python with the `scikit-learn` library. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Using `scikit-learn`\n\n`scikit-learn` provides a way to use a precomputed distance matrix with `NearestNeighbors` by setting the `metric` parameter to `'precomputed'`. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Compute Your Distance Matrix:** Ensure that you have a square distance matrix where `distance[i, j]` represents the distance between the `i-th` and `j-th` samples.\n\n2. **Use the NearestNeighbors Class:**\n\n   ```python\n   from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors\n   import numpy as np\n\n   # Example distance matrix\n   distance_matrix = np.array([\n       [0.0, 1.0, 2.0],\n       [1.0, 0.0, 1.5],\n       [2.0, 1.5, 0.0]\n   ])\n\n   # Initialize NearestNeighbors with precomputed metric\n   nbrs = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=2, metric='precomputed')\n\n   # Fit the model using the distance matrix\n   nbrs.fit(distance_matrix)\n\n   # Find the nearest neighbors for each sample\n   distances, indices = nbrs.kneighbors(distance_matrix)\n\n   print(\"Nearest Neighbors Indices:\\n\", indices)\n   print(\"Distances:\\n\", distances)\n   ```\n\n### Using `scipy`\n\nIf you prefer using `scipy`, you can compute the nearest neighbors using the `scipy.spatial.distance` module. However, note that `scipy` does not have a direct implementation for nearest neighbors like `scikit-learn`.\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Precomputed Metric:** When using `metric='precomputed'`, the input to the `fit` method should be a distance matrix.\n- **Indices and Distances:** The `kneighbors` method returns the indices of the nearest neighbors as well as the distances to them.\n\nThis approach should work well if you already have a distance matrix and want to leverage it for nearest neighbor searches."
