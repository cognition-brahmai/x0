I know that there is machine code and PTX code embedded in my binary and that this can be controlled via the switches -code and -arch, or a combination of both using -gencode. According to the CUDA documentation, there are two ways of specifying architectures: sm_XX and compute_XX, where compute_XX refers to a virtual and sm_XX to a real architecture. The flag -arch only takes identifiers for virtual architectures, such as compute_XX, whereas the -code flag takes both, identifiers for real and virtual architectures. The documentation states that -arch specifies the virtual architectures for which the input files are compiled, but this PTX code is not automatically compiled to machine code. Then, -code is supposed to specify which architectures the PTX code is assembled and optimized for. However, what I'm unsure about is which PTX or binary code will be embedded in the binary. For example, if I specify -arch=compute_30 -code=sm_52, does that mean my code will first be compiled to feature level 3.0 PTX from which afterwards machine code for feature level 5.2 will be created? And what will be embedded in the binary? If I just specify -code=sm_52, what will happen then? Will only machine code for V5.2 be embedded that has been created out of V5.2 PTX code? And how would this be different to -code=compute_52?"

        "content": "When compiling CUDA code using `nvcc`, understanding the use of `-arch` and `-code` is crucial for generating the appropriate PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) and binary code for your target architectures. Here's a breakdown of how these flags work and their implications:\n\n### General Concepts:\n\n- **Virtual Architecture (`compute_XX`)**: This is a high-level, intermediate representation of your code. PTX is a virtual ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) that allows for forward compatibility. The `compute_XX` specifies which version of PTX should be generated.\n\n- **Real Architecture (`sm_XX`)**: This refers to the actual hardware architecture of the NVIDIA GPU. The `sm_XX` specifies the specific GPU architecture for which the code should be optimized and compiled into machine code.\n\n### Using `-arch` and `-code`:\n\n- **`-arch=compute_XX`**: This flag determines the virtual architecture version for which the input files are initially compiled. This results in PTX code generation for the specified virtual architecture.\n\n- **`-code=sm_XX` or `compute_XX`**: This flag specifies which architectures the PTX code should be further compiled into machine code, or directly compile into machine code if a real architecture is specified.\n\n### Examples:\n\n1. **`-arch=compute_30 -code=sm_52`**:\n   - PTX code is generated for compute capability 3.0.\n   - This PTX code is then compiled into machine code specifically for the real architecture `sm_52`.\n   - The resulting binary will contain machine code for `sm_52`, and optionally, PTX for `compute_30` may also be included for JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation on other architectures.\n\n2. **`-code=sm_52`**:\n   - If only `-code=sm_52` is specified, `nvcc` will assume a default `-arch` value based on the highest supported architecture of the toolkit in use.\n   - It will generate machine code directly for `sm_52`. If no specific PTX version is specified, PTX might not be included unless explicitly requested with another `-code` value like `compute_52`.\n\n3. **`-code=compute_52`**:\n   - This will generate PTX code for compute capability 5.2, but not machine code. This PTX can be JIT compiled to run on any compatible GPU architecture that supports compute capability 5.2 or higher.\n\n### Embedding in the Binary:\n\n- When you use `-arch=compute_XX`, PTX code for the specified compute capability is embedded in the binary.\n- When you use `-code=sm_XX`, the binary will contain machine code for the specified real architecture.\n- If both PTX and machine code are specified, both will be embedded in the binary, allowing for JIT compilation on GPUs that support the PTX version but not the specific machine code architecture.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- Use `-gencode` to explicitly specify combinations of `compute_XX` and `sm_XX` for more control, e.g., `-gencode arch=compute_30,code=sm_52`.\n- Consider your target deployment environments and include PTX for forward compatibility if your application might run on future architectures.\n- Ensure you are generating code for all architectures you intend to support to optimize performance and compatibility.\n\nBy carefully selecting the appropriate flags, you can ensure your CUDA application is optimized for the GPUs it will run on while maintaining flexibility for future architectures."
