According to the \"Getting Started\" guide for Tensorflow, they have an example for convolutional neural networks which can be run using the command \"$ python tensorflow/models/image/mnist/convolutional.py\". However, I'm unable to find the directory where this file is located when installing with pip. Can you help me locate it?"

The example scripts, such as the one for convolutional neural networks, are part of the TensorFlow models repository, which is separate from the main TensorFlow library.\n\nTo access these examples, you need to clone or download the TensorFlow models repository from GitHub. Here's how you can do that:\n\n1. **Clone the repository**:\n   Open a terminal and run the following command to clone the TensorFlow models repository:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git\n   ```\n\n2. **Navigate to the desired example**:\n   Once the repository is cloned, you can navigate to the specific example you're interested in. For the MNIST convolutional example, you would typically look under the `models/official/vision/image_classification` or similar directory, depending on the structure of the repository at the time.\n\n3. **Run the example**:\n   Now you can run the example script using Python. Navigate to the directory containing the script and execute it:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd models/path_to_example\n   python convolutional.py\n   ```\n\nRemember, the directory structure might change with different versions of the repository, so ensure you navigate to the appropriate path within the cloned directory. You can also browse the repository on GitHub to find the exact location of the example you're interested in."
