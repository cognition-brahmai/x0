I am trying to combine these two dataframes into a single dataframe using the DataFrame.join() command in pandas. I attempted to use the following line of code `restaurant_review_frame.join(other=restaurant_ids_dataframe,on='business_id',how='left')` to create a left join of `restaurant_ids_frame` and `restaurant_review_frame` on the column 'business_id'. However, I am encountering an error that says `Exception: columns overlap: Index([business_id, stars, type], dtype=object)`. As I am new to using pandas, I am unsure about what I am doing wrong when executing the join statement. Could you provide some guidance on how to correctly join these dataframes?"

        "content": "The error you are encountering suggests that there are overlapping column names between the two dataframes you are trying to join. When using the `join()` method, if there are common column names (other than the joining column), Pandas raises an exception because it does not know how to handle these overlapping columns.\n\nHere are a few steps to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Identify Overlapping Columns**: Check both dataframes to identify which column names are causing the overlap. In your error message, it seems like `business_id`, `stars`, and `type` might be common columns.\n\n2. **Rename Overlapping Columns**: If there are columns with the same name but different data, you can rename them in one of the dataframes before joining.\n\n3. **Use the `merge()` Method**: Instead of `join()`, you might find the `merge()` function more straightforward for this operation. It allows you to specify the key columns for both dataframes and handles overlapping column names more gracefully.\n\nHere's how you can use the `merge()` method to achieve the join:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrames\nrestaurant_ids_dataframe = pd.DataFrame({\n    'business_id': [1, 2, 3],\n    'name': ['Restaurant A', 'Restaurant B', 'Restaurant C']\n})\n\nrestaurant_review_frame = pd.DataFrame({\n    'business_id': [1, 2, 3],\n    'stars': [5, 4, 3],\n    'type': ['food', 'service', 'ambiance']\n})\n\n# Use merge to perform a left join on 'business_id'\ncombined_dataframe = restaurant_review_frame.merge(\n    restaurant_ids_dataframe,\n    on='business_id',\n    how='left'\n)\n\nprint(combined_dataframe)\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- We use `merge()` instead of `join()`, specifying `on='business_id'` to indicate the column on which to join.\n- `how='left'` indicates a left join, similar to what you were attempting with `join()`.\n- This approach handles overlapping column names more effectively, as it only merges on the specified key columns.\n\nIf you still face issues with overlapping columns, make sure to rename or drop unnecessary columns before the merge operation."
