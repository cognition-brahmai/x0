        "content": "To iterate over an `OrderedDict` from end to beginning, you can use the `reversed()` function, which works on sequences like lists. However, since an `OrderedDict` is not directly reversible, you can convert its items to a list and then reverse that list. Here's how you can do it, along with logic to process the last three elements and decide on the union based on the lower sum of the values:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\n\n# Sample OrderedDict with letter frequencies\nletter_freq = OrderedDict([\n    ('a', 5),\n    ('b', 2),\n    ('c', 3),\n    ('d', 8),\n    ('e', 1),\n    ('f', 4)\n])\n\n# Convert the items to a list and reverse it\nreversed_items = list(reversed(letter_freq.items()))\n\n# Iterate over the reversed items\nfor i in range(0, len(reversed_items), 3):\n    # Get the last three elements (or fewer if near the start)\n    window = reversed_items[i:i + 3]\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the values\n    sum_values = sum(value for _, value in window)\n\n    # Decide on the union object based on the sum (example logic)\n    # Here, I'm just printing the elements and their sum\n    print(f\"Elements: {window}, Sum: {sum_values}\")\n\n    # You can implement your own logic to decide on the union object\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Reversing the OrderedDict**: Since `OrderedDict` itself does not support reversing, convert its items to a list and then apply `reversed()`.\n\n2. **Iterating in Chunks**: Use a loop with a step size of 3 to process the last three elements at a time. Adjust the step size as needed to suit your requirements.\n\n3. **Calculating the Sum**: For each set of three elements, calculate the sum of their values. You can then implement your logic to decide the union object based on this sum or any other criteria you have.\n\nThis should help you iterate over the `OrderedDict` from end to beginning and execute your logic on chunks of elements."
