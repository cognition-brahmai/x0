Here's a Python program that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef are_anagrams(str1, str2):\n    # Remove any spaces and convert to lowercase to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive\n    str1 = str1.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n    str2 = str2.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\n\n    # Check if lengths are different; if so, they cannot be anagrams\n    if len(str1) != len(str2):\n        return False\n\n    # Use a dictionary to count the frequency of each character in the first string\n    char_count = {}\n\n    for char in str1:\n        char_count[char] = char_count.get(char, 0) + 1\n\n    # Subtract the frequency of each character found in the second string\n    for char in str2:\n        if char in char_count:\n            char_count[char] -= 1\n        else:\n            # If a character is found in str2 that's not in str1, they are not anagrams\n            return False\n\n    # If all values in the dictionary are zero, the strings are anagrams\n    return all(count == 0 for count in char_count.values())\n\n# Example usage:\nstr1 = \"listen\"\nstr2 = \"silent\"\nprint(are_anagrams(str1, str2))  # Output: True\n\nstr1 = \"hello\"\nstr2 = \"world\"\nprint(are_anagrams(str1, str2))  # Output: False\n```\n\nThis program first normalizes the input strings by removing spaces and converting them to lowercase. It then counts the occurrences of each character in the first string and adjusts these counts based on the characters in the second string. If all character counts return to zero, then the two strings are anagrams."
