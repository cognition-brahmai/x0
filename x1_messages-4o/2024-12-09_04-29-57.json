I've tried altering the run configurations but that hasn't helped. Further, the PyCharm documentation doesn't provide sufficient help on this matter either. Although, I've noticed that the console captures critical level log messages, I'm interested to know if there's a way to configure this to catch debug level messages. One post suggested adding the -s option to the build configuration, but it didn't produce the desired result. How can I solve this issue?"

        "content": "To view log messages at different levels, including debug level messages, in the PyCharm console while running unit tests with the `unittest2` module, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Configure the Logging in Your Test Code:**\n   Make sure that your test code is configured to log messages at the desired level. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   import logging\n   import unittest2 as unittest\n\n   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)  # Set the logging level to DEBUG\n\n   class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):\n       def test_logging(self):\n           logging.debug(\"This is a debug message\")\n           logging.info(\"This is an info message\")\n           logging.warning(\"This is a warning message\")\n           logging.error(\"This is an error message\")\n           logging.critical(\"This is a critical message\")\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       unittest.main()\n   ```\n\n2. **Check PyCharm Run/Debug Configuration:**\n   Ensure that your test configuration in PyCharm is set up correctly.\n\n   - Go to `Run` > `Edit Configurations...`.\n   - Select the configuration for your test.\n   - Make sure there are no additional options that might suppress output or alter logging behavior.\n\n3. **Use the `-s` Option:**\n   The `-s` option can be helpful in some cases to prevent capturing of output, but it's primarily used with `pytest`. However, you can try adding it to the Additional Arguments in the PyCharm Run Configuration to see if it affects the behavior.\n\n4. **Use a Custom Logger:**\n   If you're still not seeing the expected output, consider using a custom logger configuration:\n\n   ```python\n   import logging\n   import unittest2 as unittest\n\n   class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):\n       def setUp(self):\n           self.logger = logging.getLogger(\"MyTestLogger\")\n           handler = logging.StreamHandler()\n           formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n           handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n           self.logger.addHandler(handler)\n           self.logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\n       def test_logging(self):\n           self.logger.debug(\"This is a debug message\")\n           self.logger.info(\"This is an info message\")\n           self.logger.warning(\"This is a warning message\")\n           self.logger.error(\"This is an error message\")\n           self.logger.critical(\"This is a critical message\")\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       unittest.main()\n   ```\n\n5. **Check Output Filters:**\n   Verify if PyCharm has any output filters enabled that might be filtering out certain levels of log messages. You can find these settings under `Settings` > `Editor` > `Console Colors`.\n\nBy ensuring that your logging configuration is set to the desired level and that PyCharm is set up to capture all output, you should be able to see all log messages, including debug-level messages, in the PyCharm console during test execution."
