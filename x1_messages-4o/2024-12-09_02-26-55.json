However, when I print `a`, it shows 1 and not 3 as expected. Here is my code:\n\n```python\ndef f():\n    a = 1\n    exec(\"a = 3\")\n    print(a)\n\nf() \n# 1 Expected 3\n```\n\nHow can I get this to print 3 as expected?"

        "content": "In Python, the `exec` function by default does not modify the local variables of the scope in which it is called. This is because the local scope is optimized for performance, and direct modifications from functions like `exec` are restricted to prevent potential issues and maintain performance.\n\nTo modify the local variable `a` using `exec`, you can explicitly define the scope in which `exec` operates by passing a dictionary to it. Here's how you can achieve the desired behavior:\n\n```python\ndef f():\n    a = 1\n    # Create a dictionary for the local context\n    local_vars = {'a': a}\n    \n    # Execute the code with the local context\n    exec(\"a = 3\", {}, local_vars)\n    \n    # Update the local variable from the context\n    a = local_vars['a']\n    \n    print(a)\n\nf() \n# This will now print 3\n```\n\nIn this code, we create a dictionary `local_vars` to act as the local context for the `exec` statement. After executing the code, we update the local variable `a` with the value from `local_vars`. This way, the change made by `exec` is reflected in your local variable."
