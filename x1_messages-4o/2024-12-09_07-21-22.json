I build the module using 'bdist_wheel' and install/upgrade it with the pip install command. The module is listed within Python 3.4 framework directory and within pip freeze. However, when I try to uninstall it using pip uninstall, I get the message \"Can't uninstall 'foo-bar'. No files were found to uninstall\". Have I possibly made a mistake in my setup.py that is preventing the module's files from being found during uninstall? I am using Python 3.4.4 and pip 8.1.2."

        "content": "It sounds like there might be an issue with the way your package is being installed or how its metadata is being recorded. Here are a few steps and considerations to help you troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check the Package Name**:\n   - Ensure that the name in your `setup.py` file matches exactly with the package name you are trying to uninstall. Pay attention to hyphens and underscores, as they can sometimes cause confusion.\n\n2. **Metadata Files**:\n   - Verify that the package's metadata files are correctly installed. When you install a package, pip creates a `.dist-info` directory under your Python site-packages directory. This directory contains metadata about the package, including the `RECORD` file which lists all installed files.\n   - Navigate to your Python site-packages directory and check if there is a directory named something like `foo_bar-x.y.z.dist-info` (where `x.y.z` is the version number of your package).\n\n3. **Check the RECORD File**:\n   - Look inside the `.dist-info` directory for a `RECORD` file. This file should list all the files that were installed as part of your package. If this file is missing or incomplete, pip may not be able to uninstall the package correctly.\n\n4. **Uninstallation with Verbose Output**:\n   - Try running the uninstall command with more verbosity to get more information about what is happening:\n     ```\n     pip uninstall --verbose foo-bar\n     ```\n\n5. **Reinstall and Uninstall**:\n   - Sometimes, simply reinstalling the package can help correct any issues with the installation metadata:\n     ```\n     pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall foo-bar\n     ```\n   - Then try uninstalling again:\n     ```\n     pip uninstall foo-bar\n     ```\n\n6. **Check for Multiple Installations**:\n   - Ensure that there aren't multiple installations of Python or pip that might be causing conflicts. Check the Python and pip paths to make sure you're using the expected versions.\n\n7. **Check for Editable Installs**:\n   - If you have installed the package in editable mode (using `pip install -e .`), it might not uninstall as expected. You may need to manually remove the source directory.\n\n8. **Manual Removal**:\n   - As a last resort, you can manually remove the package from the site-packages directory and its entry in `pip freeze`. However, be cautious with this approach to avoid accidentally removing the wrong files.\n\n9. **Update Tools**:\n   - Although you're using older versions of Python and pip, consider updating pip to the latest version supported by Python 3.4 to see if it resolves any known issues:\n     ```\n     python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n     ```\n\nIf none of these steps work, you might want to review the setup.py file to ensure that it is configured correctly, especially the `packages` and `package_data` arguments in the `setup()` function."
