The function should now only allow purchases of books that are in stock and have a price less than $50. Additionally, the function should now accept multiple book IDs as input, and the shipping address should be verified against a database of valid addresses. The function should also accept multiple payment methods, including credit card, PayPal, and cryptocurrency, and should apply different tax rates based on the payment method. Finally, the function should generate a detailed invoice that includes the total cost of the purchase, including shipping and taxes, as well as a list of all purchased books and their prices."

        "content": "To rewrite the code incorporating the additional constraints and requirements you've specified, we'll assume the existence of certain utilities and data structures, such as a database access layer for books and addresses, and a way to handle different payment methods and tax calculations. Here's a sketch of how this function might look:\n\n```python\nclass BookStore:\n    def __init__(self, book_db, address_db, tax_rates):\n        self.book_db = book_db  # Database of books\n        self.address_db = address_db  # Database of valid addresses\n        self.tax_rates = tax_rates  # Tax rates dictionary by payment method\n\n    def is_address_valid(self, address):\n        # Check if the address is in the valid database\n        return address in self.address_db\n\n    def calculate_tax(self, total_cost, payment_method):\n        # Calculate tax based on payment method\n        tax_rate = self.tax_rates.get(payment_method, 0)\n        return total_cost * tax_rate\n\n    def generate_invoice(self, purchased_books, total_cost, shipping_cost, taxes):\n        # Generate a detailed invoice\n        invoice = \"Invoice:\\n\"\n        invoice += \"Purchased Books:\\n\"\n        for book in purchased_books:\n            invoice += f\"- {book['title']}: ${book['price']}\\n\"\n        invoice += f\"Subtotal: ${total_cost}\\n\"\n        invoice += f\"Shipping: ${shipping_cost}\\n\"\n        invoice += f\"Taxes: ${taxes}\\n\"\n        invoice += f\"Total: ${total_cost + shipping_cost + taxes}\\n\"\n        return invoice\n\n    def purchase_books(self, book_ids, shipping_address, payment_method, shipping_cost=5.0):\n        if not self.is_address_valid(shipping_address):\n            return \"Invalid shipping address.\"\n\n        purchased_books = []\n        total_cost = 0\n\n        for book_id in book_ids:\n            book = self.book_db.get(book_id)\n            if book and book['in_stock'] and book['price'] < 50:\n                purchased_books.append(book)\n                total_cost += book['price']\n            else:\n                print(f\"Book ID {book_id} is either out of stock or too expensive.\")\n\n        if not purchased_books:\n            return \"No valid books to purchase.\"\n\n        taxes = self.calculate_tax(total_cost, payment_method)\n        total_cost += taxes + shipping_cost\n\n        invoice = self.generate_invoice(purchased_books, total_cost - taxes - shipping_cost, shipping_cost, taxes)\n        return invoice\n\n# Example usage\nbook_db = {\n    1: {'title': 'Book A', 'price': 30, 'in_stock': True},\n    2: {'title': 'Book B', 'price': 60, 'in_stock': True},\n    3: {'title': 'Book C', 'price': 20, 'in_stock': False},\n    4: {'title': 'Book D', 'price': 40, 'in_stock': True},\n}\n\naddress_db = {\n    '123 Main St': True,\n    '456 Elm St': True,\n}\n\ntax_rates = {\n    'credit_card': 0.05,\n    'paypal': 0.03,\n    'cryptocurrency': 0.01,\n}\n\nstore = BookStore(book_db, address_db, tax_rates)\ninvoice = store.purchase_books([1, 2, 4], '123 Main St', 'credit_card')\nprint(invoice)\n```\n\n### Key Aspects of the Code:\n\n1. **Book and Address Validation**: The function checks if the selected books are in stock and priced under $50. It also verifies the shipping address against a valid addresses database.\n\n2. **Payment Methods and Tax Calculation**: The function accepts multiple payment methods (credit card, PayPal, cryptocurrency) and applies different tax rates based on the payment method.\n\n3. **Invoice Generation**: A detailed invoice is generated that includes each book's title and price, subtotal, shipping, taxes, and total cost.\n\n4. **Data Abstraction**: The example assumes `book_db` and `address_db` are dictionaries representing the books and addresses databases, respectively, for simplicity.\n\nThis setup allows flexibility and extensibility for further features, such as adding more payment methods or adjusting pricing models."
