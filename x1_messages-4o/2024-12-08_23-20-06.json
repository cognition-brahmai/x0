Here's an example:\n\n```ruby\ndef generate_analogy(sport1, sport2)\n  analogy = \"#{sport1} is to #{sport2} as a court is to a table\"\n  analogy += \"\\n#{sport1} is to #{sport2} as a racket is to a paddle\"\n  analogy += \"\\n#{sport1} is to #{sport2} as outdoor is to indoor\"\n  analogy += \"\\n#{sport1} is to #{sport2} as a ball is to a ping-pong ball\"\n  return analogy\nend\n\nputs generate_analogy(\"tennis\", \"table tennis\")\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n\n```\ntennis is to table tennis as a court is to a table\ntennis is to table tennis as a racket is to a paddle\ntennis is to table tennis as outdoor is to indoor\ntennis is to table tennis as a ball is to a ping-pong ball\n```\n\nThis approach provides a broader comparison between tennis and table tennis by highlighting different aspects such as the playing surface, equipment, environment, and the type of ball used. You can modify or add more analogies as needed to capture other similarities or differences."
