Here's how you can do it:\n\n```bash\na=\"Hi all\"\nlowercase_a=\"${a,,}\"\necho \"$lowercase_a\"\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nhi all\n```\n\nThe `${a,,}` syntax is a feature of Bash that converts all characters in the string to lowercase. This feature is available in Bash version 4 and above.\n\nIf you are using an older version of Bash, or if you want another method, you can use the `tr` command:\n\n```bash\na=\"Hi all\"\nlowercase_a=$(echo \"$a\" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')\necho \"$lowercase_a\"\n```\n\nThis will also output:\n\n```\nhi all\n```\n\nBoth methods will effectively convert your string to lowercase."
