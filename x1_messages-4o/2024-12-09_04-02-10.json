I can accomplish this using the example given on the Seaborn website, however, I am confused about the line 'tips = sns.load_dataset(\"tips\")'. It is unclear to me what exactly 'load_dataset' does. I've located the 'tips.csv' file, but I still can't find sufficient documentation on what 'load_dataset' does. I tried to load my own csv file using this function but failed. I also tried renaming the 'tips' file and it still worked. My main question is, where does 'load_dataset' look for the files, and can I use this function to load my own data for creating boxplots? I managed to get my boxplots working using my own DataFrame, but I am still curious if 'load_dataset' can be used for my own datasets or if it's only used for tutorial examples."

        "content": "The `sns.load_dataset()` function in Seaborn is specifically designed to load sample datasets that are included with the library for demonstration and tutorial purposes. These datasets are not stored locally on your machine; instead, they are fetched from an online repository maintained by Seaborn. When you call `sns.load_dataset(\"tips\")`, the function downloads the \"tips\" dataset from this repository and loads it into a Pandas DataFrame.\n\nHere's some additional information about `sns.load_dataset()`:\n\n1. **Purpose**: It is meant to provide easy access to sample datasets for practicing data visualization techniques using Seaborn.\n\n2. **Dataset Location**: These datasets are stored online, not locally. When you use `sns.load_dataset()`, it retrieves the data from the online repository.\n\n3. **Use with Custom Data**: Unfortunately, `sns.load_dataset()` is not designed for loading your own datasets. It's strictly for accessing the built-in datasets provided by Seaborn.\n\n4. **Loading Your Own Data**: To load your own CSV files, you should use Pandas' `pd.read_csv()` function. For example:\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n   my_data = pd.read_csv(\"path/to/your/data.csv\")\n   ```\n\n5. **Renaming Files**: Renaming or moving the \"tips.csv\" file on your local machine has no effect on `sns.load_dataset()` because the function isn't accessing your local filesystem to retrieve the data.\n\nIf you want to create grouped boxplots with your own data, continue using Pandas to load your data into a DataFrame and then use Seaborn to create the plots. Here\u2019s a basic example using your own DataFrame:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load your own data\nmy_data = pd.read_csv(\"path/to/your/data.csv\")\n\n# Create a boxplot\nsns.boxplot(x='category_column', y='value_column', hue='grouping_column', data=my_data)\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nReplace `'category_column'`, `'value_column'`, and `'grouping_column'` with the actual column names from your dataset."
