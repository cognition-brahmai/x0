        "content": "The issue you're encountering is because `mpl_toolkits` is not a standalone package that you can install via `pip`. It is actually a part of the `matplotlib` library, which is a popular plotting library in Python. The `mpl_toolkits` module comes bundled with `matplotlib`, specifically with the `basemap` and some other toolkits like `mplot3d` and `axes_grid1`.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you just need to ensure that you have `matplotlib` installed. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. First, make sure you have `matplotlib` installed. You can install it using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install matplotlib\n   ```\n\n2. Once `matplotlib` is installed, you should be able to import `mpl_toolkits` in your Python script without any issues.\n\n3. If you need specific functionalities from `mpl_toolkits`, such as `mplot3d`, you can import them like this:\n\n   ```python\n   from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\n   ```\n\n4. If you are interested in `basemap`, note that it is a separate package and you need to install it using:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install basemap\n   ```\n\nBy ensuring `matplotlib` is installed, you should have access to the `mpl_toolkits` module. If you continue to face issues, make sure that your Python environment is set up correctly and that there are no conflicts with other packages."
