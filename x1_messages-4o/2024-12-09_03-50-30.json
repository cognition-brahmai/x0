However, I am aiming to accomplish something along the lines of re.match(r\"(\\d.*?)\\s(\\d.*?)\", \"(CALL_GROUP_1) (CALL_GROUP_2)\"). Is there a way that I can construct a new string instantaneously from the groups that the Regex just captured?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this by using the `re.sub()` method, which allows you to replace parts of a string using regex and a replacement function or string. If you want to construct a new string from the groups captured by your regex, you can use a replacement function to specify how to format the replacement string based on the captured groups.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use `re.sub()` to achieve what you're looking for:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Define the pattern to match and the string to search\npattern = r\"(\\d.*?)\\s(\\d.*?)\"\nstring = \"123 abc 456 def\"\n\n# Use re.sub() with a replacement function\ndef replacement(match):\n    # Access the captured groups using match.group(1), match.group(2), etc.\n    group1 = match.group(1)\n    group2 = match.group(2)\n    # Construct the new string using the captured groups\n    return f\"(CALL_GROUP_{group1}) (CALL_GROUP_{group2})\"\n\n# Apply the regex and replacement function\nresult = re.sub(pattern, replacement, string)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `replacement` function takes a match object as its argument and constructs a new string using the captured groups. The `f\"(CALL_GROUP_{group1}) (CALL_GROUP_{group2})\"` part is where you define how you want to format the replacement string based on the captured groups.\n\nThis approach allows you to dynamically construct the replacement string using the groups captured by the regex."
