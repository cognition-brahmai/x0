        "content": "Certainly! Below is a Java program that uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the 34th Fibonacci number. This approach stores previously computed Fibonacci numbers to avoid redundant calculations, thereby optimizing time complexity.\n\n```java\npublic class FibonacciDP {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int n = 34;\n        System.out.println(\"The 34th Fibonacci number is: \" + fibonacci(n));\n    }\n\n    public static long fibonacci(int n) {\n        if (n <= 0) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"n must be a positive integer.\");\n        }\n        \n        long[] fib = new long[n + 1];\n        fib[0] = 0;\n        fib[1] = 1;\n\n        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\n            fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2];\n        }\n\n        return fib[n];\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Dynamic Programming Array:** An array `fib[]` is used to store the Fibonacci numbers up to the nth number.\n- **Base Cases:** The first two Fibonacci numbers are initialized (`fib[0] = 0` and `fib[1] = 1`).\n- **Iterative Calculation:** A loop calculates each subsequent Fibonacci number as the sum of the two preceding numbers, storing each result in the array to avoid recalculation.\n- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity of this approach is O(n), as each Fibonacci number up to the desired one is computed exactly once.\n- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is also O(n) due to the array used to store the Fibonacci numbers.\n\nThis program will output the 34th Fibonacci number when executed."
