        "content": "Is there a way to specify in a pip requirements file, a package installation with both a minimum and maximum version range? For example, I want to always install the most recent minor release of the 0.5.x branch of a third-party library I am using, but I don't want pip to attempt to install any newer major versions such as 0.6.x because the API differs. Despite the availability of the 0.6.x branch, the developers are still releasing patches and bugfixes to the 0.5.x branch. Therefore, I would like to avoid using a static `package==0.5.9` line in my requirements file."

        "content": "Yes, you can specify both minimum and maximum version ranges in a `requirements.txt` file for `pip`. This allows you to control the version of a package within a specific range. To install the most recent minor release of the 0.5.x branch while avoiding any 0.6.x versions, you can specify the version range using comparison operators.\n\nHere's how you can do it in your `requirements.txt` file:\n\n```\npackage>=0.5.0,<0.6.0\n```\n\nThis line tells `pip` to install the latest available version of `package` that is at least 0.5.0 but less than 0.6.0. This way, you can ensure that you are using the latest minor release and patches within the 0.5.x branch, while avoiding any potential breaking changes introduced in the 0.6.x branch."
