I have a chart that displays both a line and a marker using a simple plot command, like so: `plt.plot([1,5,3,8,4],'-bo');`. However, after importing seaborn, the same code displays the line only, without the marker. I believe this is due to a potential bug (https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/issues/344). After importing seaborn, is there a way to reset all the parameters back to their original versions?"

This can sometimes cause issues like the one you're experiencing, where the default behavior of Matplotlib functions changes.\n\nTo reset the parameters back to their original Matplotlib settings after importing Seaborn, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Your plot code\nplt.plot([1, 5, 3, 8, 4], '-bo')\n\n# Reset to original Matplotlib settings\nplt.rcdefaults()\n\n# Now plot again\nplt.plot([1, 5, 3, 8, 4], '-bo')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThe `plt.rcdefaults()` function resets the rc (runtime configuration) settings to their default values, effectively undoing the changes made by Seaborn's style settings. This should restore the marker display in your plot."
