I'm trying to iterate through a group of files in a folder on my local machine and upload only the ones where the file names contain \"Service_Areas\" to my FTP site. I'm using Python 3.6.1 32 bit on a Windows 10 64 bit machine. My code is as follows:\n\n```python\nftp = FTP('ftp.ftpsite.org')\nusername = ('username')\npassword = ('password')\nftp.login(username,password)\nftp.cwd(username.upper())\nftp.cwd('2017_05_02')\n\nfor i in os.listdir('C:\\FTP_testing'):\n    if i.startswith(\"Service_Area\"):\n        local_path = os.path.join('C:\\FTP_testing',i)\n        file = open(local_path,'rb')\n        ftp.storbinary(\"STOR \" + i, open(file, 'rb'))\n        file.close()\n        continue\n    else:\n        print('nope')\n\nftp.quit()\n```\n\nHowever, I'm encountering this error:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\Test1.py\", line 32, in &lt;module&gt;\n    ftp.storbinary(\"STOR \" + str(i), open(file, 'rb'))\nTypeError: expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not _io.BufferedReader\n```\n\nCould you suggest a solution to this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that you're trying to open the file twice, which leads to a misuse of the `open()` function. Specifically, in the line:\n\n```python\nftp.storbinary(\"STOR \" + i, open(file, 'rb'))\n```\n\nYou're attempting to open a file object that is already open. Instead, you should pass the file object directly to `ftp.storbinary()`. Here's how you can fix your code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom ftplib import FTP\n\nftp = FTP('ftp.ftpsite.org')\nusername = 'username'\npassword = 'password'\nftp.login(username, password)\nftp.cwd(username.upper())\nftp.cwd('2017_05_02')\n\nfor i in os.listdir('C:\\\\FTP_testing'):  # Use double backslashes or raw strings\n    if i.startswith(\"Service_Area\"):\n        local_path = os.path.join('C:\\\\FTP_testing', i)  # Use double backslashes or raw strings\n        with open(local_path, 'rb') as file:\n            ftp.storbinary(\"STOR \" + i, file)\n        print(f'Uploaded {i}')\n    else:\n        print('nope')\n\nftp.quit()\n```\n\nHere are a few changes and improvements made:\n\n1. **File Opening**: Use a `with` statement to open the file. This ensures the file is properly closed after its block is exited, even if an error occurs.\n\n2. **File Path**: Use double backslashes (`\\\\`) in file paths or use raw strings (e.g., `r'C:\\FTP_testing'`) to avoid issues with escape characters on Windows systems.\n\n3. **Passing File Object**: Pass the already opened file object `file` directly to `ftp.storbinary()`.\n\nThese changes should resolve the `TypeError` and properly upload the specified files to your FTP server."
