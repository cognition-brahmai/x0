Specifically, I'm looking for a way to return values based on an 'if' condition, all on the same line. In C++, this can be done with the '?' operator as shown in the following code:\n\n```c++\n// C++\nvalue = ( a > 10 ? b : c )\n```"

        "content": "Yes, Python has a conditional expression that functions similarly to the ternary operator in C++. In Python, you can achieve this using a one-liner conditional expression in the format `x if condition else y`. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\n# Python equivalent\nvalue = b if a > 10 else c\n```\n\nIn this expression, if the condition `a > 10` is true, `value` will be assigned the value of `b`; otherwise, it will be assigned the value of `c`. This concise syntax allows you to perform conditional assignments or evaluations in a single line, much like the ternary operator in C++."
