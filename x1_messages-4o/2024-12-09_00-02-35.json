Got any wild plans this year, or are you going to spend it with your nose in a book as usual?\n\n**Benny:** Well, Charlie, I was thinking about reading \"The History of Sand\" volumes 1 through 12. But, you know, I'm open to suggestions!\n\n**Charlie:** Volumes 1 to 12? Benny, you're the only person I know who could get a tan from reading so much! How about something a bit more...adventurous?\n\n**Benny:** Adventurous, you say? Like switching to audiobooks? I hear they pair well with sunblock.\n\n**Charlie:** *laughs* No, no! I meant something like...a road trip! We could explore all the weird roadside attractions. I\u2019ve always wanted to see the world\u2019s largest ball of yarn!\n\n**Benny:** Hmm, intriguing. But only if we can stop at the library in every town. I want to see if they have any rare editions of \"The History of Sand.\"\n\n**Charlie:** *rolls eyes* Fine, fine. But I\u2019m in charge of the playlist. You need some tunes to liven up that scholarly spirit of yours!\n\n**Benny:** Deal! As long as none of the songs are about anything sandy... I don't want spoilers.\n\n**Charlie:** *grinning* It\u2019s a deal! This summer, we\u2019ll be the explorers of both the open road and dusty tomes. Who knows, maybe we\u2019ll find a book about the world's largest ball of yarn!\n\n**Benny:** With you around, anything is possible, Charlie. Just promise me one thing?\n\n**Charlie:** What\u2019s that, Benny?\n\n**Benny:** We pack plenty of bookmarks. You never know when you might need to save your place in an adventure!\n\n**Charlie:** *laughs* You got it, Benny. Adventure awaits!\n\n---"
