I am currently using the code `df2 = df1['company_name'].str.contains((\"apple\"), na=False)`, which works for lowercase and returns only \"apple\". However, I need it to find all instances of \"apple\", regardless of case, such as \"APPLE\", \"Apple\", etc. I was wondering if there is a function, something like `df2 = df1['company_name'].str.contains.caseignore(((\"apple\"), na=False))`, that can ignore the case while searching for a string in pandas dataframe."

        "content": "You can achieve case-insensitive string matching in a pandas DataFrame by using the `str.contains()` method with the `case` parameter set to `False`. This will allow you to match strings regardless of their case. Here's how you can modify your code to accomplish this:\n\n```python\ndf2 = df1['company_name'].str.contains(\"apple\", case=False, na=False)\n```\n\nBy setting `case=False`, the `str.contains()` method will perform a case-insensitive search for the string \"apple\" in the `company_name` column. The `na=False` parameter ensures that any `NaN` values in the column are treated as `False` and not included in the result. This should return all instances of \"apple\", \"APPLE\", \"Apple\", etc., in your DataFrame."
