For instance, how can I transform a list such as `[1, 2, [3, 4, [5],[]], [6]]` into a flat list like `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`?"

        "content": "To flatten a list in Python that can contain nested lists of arbitrary length and depth, while ensuring that string objects are not flattened into their constituent characters, you can use a recursive approach. Here's a function that does exactly that:\n\n```python\ndef flatten_list(nested_list):\n    flat_list = []\n    for element in nested_list:\n        if isinstance(element, list):\n            # Recursively extend the flat_list with elements from the nested list\n            flat_list.extend(flatten_list(element))\n        else:\n            # Append non-list elements directly\n            flat_list.append(element)\n    return flat_list\n\n# Example usage\nnested_list = [1, 2, [3, 4, [5], []], [6]]\nflattened = flatten_list(nested_list)\nprint(flattened)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `flatten_list` takes a nested list as input.\n- It iterates over each element in the list:\n  - If the element is a list, it recursively calls `flatten_list` on that element and extends the `flat_list` with the result.\n  - If the element is not a list (including strings), it directly appends the element to `flat_list`.\n- This approach ensures that strings are not treated as lists of characters and are appended as whole objects to the flattened list.\n\nThis method is efficient and handles lists with arbitrary nesting correctly."
