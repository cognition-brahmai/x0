However, it seems that there isn't an evident API for that. How can I adjust my hook to achieve this? Is there possibly a git-config setting or an environment variable that would allow me to set this? The source code for my hook is as follows:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport logging\nimport os.path as P\n\nfrom flake8.main import git\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    ret = git.hook(\n        strict=git.config_for('strict'),\n        lazy=git.config_for('lazy'),\n    )\n    if ret:\n        sys.exit(ret)\n```"

        "content": "To modify the line length limit in Flake8 for a specific project, you can use a configuration file. Flake8 supports several configuration files, such as `setup.cfg`, `tox.ini`, or `.flake8`. You can specify the line length limit in one of these files, and Flake8 will read the configuration when it runs.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can set it up:\n\n1. **Create or Edit a Configuration File**: Add a configuration file to the root of your project if it doesn't exist. You can use any of the following file names: `.flake8`, `setup.cfg`, or `tox.ini`.\n\n2. **Specify the Line Length**: Add the following section to the configuration file to set the maximum line length:\n\n   ```ini\n   [flake8]\n   max-line-length = 120\n   ```\n\n   Replace `120` with whatever line length limit you prefer.\n\n3. **Ensure the Hook Uses the Configuration**: If your Flake8 hook is running in the same directory as your configuration file, it should automatically pick up the settings. However, ensure the hook script is executed from the root directory of your project or adjust the script to locate the configuration file correctly.\n\n4. **Optionally Use Environment Variables**: If you want to set the line length using an environment variable, you can modify the Flake8 hook script to read from an environment variable and pass that as a parameter to Flake8. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   #!/usr/bin/env python\n   import os\n   import sys\n   from flake8.main import git\n\n   MAX_LINE_LENGTH = os.getenv('FLAKE8_MAX_LINE_LENGTH', '79')  # Default to 79 if not set\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       ret = git.hook(\n           strict=git.config_for('strict'),\n           lazy=git.config_for('lazy'),\n           max_line_length=MAX_LINE_LENGTH\n       )\n       if ret:\n           sys.exit(ret)\n   ```\n\n   Make sure to set the `FLAKE8_MAX_LINE_LENGTH` environment variable in your shell or CI/CD environment before running the hook:\n\n   ```bash\n   export FLAKE8_MAX_LINE_LENGTH=120\n   ```\n\nThis approach should help you modify the line length limit for Flake8 in your specific project while using a git hook."
