I have noticed that a zombie process is created when the subprocess completes. I am unable to kill this subprocess unless I kill the parent Python process. Is there a way to kill the subprocess without killing the parent? I would prefer to run my script with no_wait() rather than using wait()."

        "content": "To avoid creating zombie processes when running a Python script from within another Python script using the `subprocess` module, it's important to ensure that you properly handle the termination of the subprocess. A zombie process is created when the subprocess has finished execution, but its exit status has not been read by the parent process. Here's how you can handle this situation:\n\n### Using `subprocess.Popen` with `communicate()`\n\nOne way to avoid zombies is by using the `communicate()` method, which waits for the process to complete and reads its output.\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\n# Start the subprocess\nprocess = subprocess.Popen(['python', 'script.py'])\n\n# Wait for the process to complete and handle output\nstdout, stderr = process.communicate()\n```\n\n### Using `Popen` with `poll()` and `wait()`\n\nIf you prefer not to block using `communicate()`, you can periodically check the process status using `poll()` and then call `wait()` to ensure the process is reaped properly.\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\n# Start the subprocess\nprocess = subprocess.Popen(['python', 'script.py'])\n\n# Check process status periodically\nwhile True:\n    status = process.poll()\n    if status is not None:\n        # Process has completed\n        break\n    time.sleep(0.1)\n\n# Ensure the process is reaped\nprocess.wait()\n```\n\n### Detach the Child Process\n\nIf you really want to avoid waiting, you can consider detaching the child process. However, this is less common and platform-dependent. On Unix-like systems, you can use `os.setsid()` to start the child process in a new session:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport subprocess\n\n# Start the subprocess in a new session\nprocess = subprocess.Popen(['python', 'script.py'], preexec_fn=os.setsid)\n\n# The parent process can exit without waiting for the child\n```\n\n### Using `subprocess` with `start_new_session`\n\nFor more cross-platform compatibility, you can use the `start_new_session` parameter available from Python 3.2 onwards:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\n# Start the subprocess in a new session\nprocess = subprocess.Popen(['python', 'script.py'], start_new_session=True)\n\n# The parent process can exit without waiting for the child\n```\n\nBy using these methods, you can ensure that your parent script does not leave behind zombie processes when running subprocesses. Always ensure to handle the subprocess appropriately according to your specific use case and requirements."
