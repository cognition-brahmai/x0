Here's my current code:\n\n```python\nmodel = Sequential()\nkeras.layers.normalization.BatchNormalization(epsilon=1e-06, mode=0, momentum=0.9, weights=None)\nmodel.add(Dense(64, input_dim=14, init='uniform'))\nmodel.add(Activation('tanh'))\nmodel.add(Dropout(0.5))\nmodel.add(Dense(64, init='uniform'))\nmodel.add(Activation('tanh'))\nmodel.add(Dropout(0.5))\nmodel.add(Dense(2, init='uniform'))\nmodel.add(Activation('softmax'))\n\nsgd = SGD(lr=0.1, decay=1e-6, momentum=0.9, nesterov=True)\nmodel.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=sgd)\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train, nb_epoch=20, batch_size=16, show_accuracy=True, validation_split=0.2, verbose = 2)\n```\n\nWhen I run this code with the second line including the BatchNormalization, and if I run the code without the second line, I get similar outputs. Am I calling the function in the right place or does it not make much of a difference?"

        "content": "It looks like there's a misunderstanding about how to use `BatchNormalization` in Keras. The line `keras.layers.normalization.BatchNormalization(...)` is not doing anything because it is not being added to the model. \n\nYou should add `BatchNormalization` as a layer within your model, just like you add `Dense`, `Activation`, and `Dropout` layers. `BatchNormalization` can be added before or after the activation functions in your model layers. Depending on the placement, it might have different effects on the model's performance. Here\u2019s an example of how you can incorporate `BatchNormalization` in your model:\n\n```python\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense, Activation, Dropout, BatchNormalization\nfrom keras.optimizers import SGD\n\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(Dense(64, input_dim=14, kernel_initializer='uniform'))\nmodel.add(BatchNormalization())  # Add Batch Normalization after the Dense layer\nmodel.add(Activation('tanh'))\nmodel.add(Dropout(0.5))\n\nmodel.add(Dense(64, kernel_initializer='uniform'))\nmodel.add(BatchNormalization())  # Add Batch Normalization after the Dense layer\nmodel.add(Activation('tanh'))\nmodel.add(Dropout(0.5))\n\nmodel.add(Dense(2, kernel_initializer='uniform'))\nmodel.add(Activation('softmax'))\n\nsgd = SGD(lr=0.1, decay=1e-6, momentum=0.9, nesterov=True)\nmodel.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=sgd, metrics=['accuracy'])\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=16, validation_split=0.2, verbose=2)\n```\n\nIn this revised code, `BatchNormalization` is added as a layer after each `Dense` layer. This helps to normalize the input to each subsequent layer, which can improve training speed and stability. \n\nNote that since you're using an older version of Keras, you might see some deprecated arguments like `init` (which should be `kernel_initializer`) and `show_accuracy` (which should be replaced with `metrics=['accuracy']`). Also, ensure you are importing `BatchNormalization` from `keras.layers` directly for better compatibility with newer versions."
