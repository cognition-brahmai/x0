        "content": "In Python's `unittest.mock` module, `patch` is a powerful tool that allows you to replace objects in your code with mock objects during testing. The `patch` function has two important parameters: `new` and `new_callable`, and understanding the difference between them is crucial for effective mocking.\n\n### `new` Argument:\n- **Purpose**: The `new` argument is used to specify the replacement object that will be used to replace the target object directly.\n- **Usage**: You should use `new` when you have a specific object you want to replace the target with. This can be a mock object, a function, or any other object.\n- **Example**: If you want to replace a function with a mock object, you can do this:\n\n  ```python\n  from unittest.mock import patch, Mock\n\n  my_mock = Mock(return_value=\"mocked result\")\n  with patch('module_name.function_name', new=my_mock):\n      result = module_name.function_name()\n      assert result == \"mocked result\"\n  ```\n\n### `new_callable` Argument:\n- **Purpose**: The `new_callable` argument is used when you want to specify a callable that will be used to create the replacement object each time the test runs.\n- **Usage**: Use `new_callable` when you want a new instance of the mock (or any other object) to be created every time the patch is applied. This is particularly useful for mocking classes or when you need a fresh mock object for each test.\n- **Example**: If you want a fresh mock object each time, you can use `new_callable`:\n\n  ```python\n  from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock\n\n  with patch('module_name.ClassName', new_callable=MagicMock) as MockClass:\n      instance = MockClass()\n      instance.some_method.return_value = \"mocked result\"\n\n      result = instance.some_method()\n      assert result == \"mocked result\"\n  ```\n\n### When to Use `new_callable` Instead of `new`:\n- **Multiple Instances**: If your test involves creating multiple instances of the target object and you want each one to be a separate mock object.\n- **Class Mocking**: When mocking classes, `new_callable` is often more appropriate because it allows you to instantiate a mock object with the behavior of a class constructor.\n- **State Isolation**: When each test needs a clean state or when the mock's state can change during the test, using `new_callable` ensures that each test gets a fresh mock object.\n\nIn summary, use `new` when you have a specific object ready to replace the target, and use `new_callable` when you need a fresh instance of a mock object or any callable for each test execution."
