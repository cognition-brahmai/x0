However, when I try to assign to `s2[j]`, I get an error: `'str' object does not support item assignment`. This is the Python code I am using:\n\n```python\ns1 = \"Hello World\"\ns2 = \"\"\nj = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(s1)):\n    s2[j] = s1[i]\n    j = j + 1\n```\n\nI am trying to replicate the functionality of this C code:\n\n```c\nint i = j = 0;\nwhile (s1[i] != '\\0')\n    s2[j++] = s1[i++];\n```\n\nHow can I solve this problem?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is because strings in Python are immutable, which means you cannot change them once they are created. You cannot assign a value to a specific index of a string like you would in C. Instead, you can build the new string by appending characters to it. Here's how you can modify your Python code to achieve similar functionality to your C code:\n\n```python\ns1 = \"Hello World\"\ns2 = \"\"\n\nfor char in s1:\n    s2 += char  # Append each character of s1 to s2\n\nprint(s2)\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over each character in `s1` and append it to `s2`, effectively replicating the behavior of your C code. The `+=` operator is used here to concatenate strings, building `s2` one character at a time."
