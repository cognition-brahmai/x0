However, when I installed Anaconda 3.5 and tried running some sample code, I'm encountering an ImportError stating \"No module named 'google'\". I've verified that the google module is present in my Python installation directory (C:\\Users\\XXX\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python35). I'm wondering if I need to link my Spyder to the Python installation directory? Why is Spyder unable to find the google module?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely due to the fact that Anaconda has its own Python environment and package management system, which is separate from the system Python installation you used to install the `google` module with `pip`. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Use Anaconda's Environment**:\n   - When you installed Anaconda, it created its own Python environment that is separate from your system Python. When you open Spyder through Anaconda, it uses this environment.\n   - To ensure that you have the `google` module in the Anaconda environment, you need to install it using Anaconda's `pip`.\n\n2. **Install the Google Module in Anaconda**:\n   - Open the Anaconda Prompt from the Start menu.\n   - Activate your Anaconda environment (if you have a specific one) by running: \n     ```bash\n     conda activate myenv\n     ```\n     Replace `myenv` with your environment name if it's not the default one.\n   - Install the `google` module using:\n     ```bash\n     pip install google\n     ```\n\n3. **Verify the Installation**:\n   - Once the installation completes, you can verify that Spyder is using the correct environment by checking the Python interpreter path in Spyder.\n   - Open Spyder and go to `Tools` > `Preferences` > `Python Interpreter`.\n   - Make sure it points to the Anaconda environment path (e.g., something like `C:\\Users\\XXX\\Anaconda3\\envs\\myenv\\python.exe`).\n\n4. **Restart Spyder**:\n   - After making these changes, restart Spyder to ensure it picks up the newly installed module.\n\nBy following these steps, Spyder should be able to find and import the `google` module successfully."
