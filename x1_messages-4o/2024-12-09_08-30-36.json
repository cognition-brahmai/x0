In your case, the `home.html` file is directly under the project directory, which is why Flask cannot find it.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you should create a `templates` directory and move your `home.html` file into it. Your project structure should look like this:\n\n```\n/myproject\n    app.py\n    /templates\n        home.html\n```\n\nAfter making this change, Flask should be able to find and render the `home.html` template without any issues."
