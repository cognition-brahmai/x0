For demonstration purposes, I begin with a sequential list of numbers using `range`. Here's my current code:\n\n```python\na = range(20)\n\nrunningTotal = []\nfor n in range(len(a)):\n    new = runningTotal[n-1] + a[n] if n > 0 else a[n]\n    runningTotal.append(new)\n\n# This one is a syntax error\n# runningTotal = [a[n] for n in range(len(a)) if n == 0 else runningTotal[n-1] + a[n]]\n\nfor i in zip(a, runningTotal):\n    print \"{0:>3}{1:>5}\".format(*i)\n```\nOutput:\n\n```python\n  0    0\n  1    1\n  2    3\n  3    6\n  4   10\n  5   15\n  6   21\n  7   28\n  8   36\n  9   45\n 10   55\n 11   66\n 12   78\n 13   91\n 14  105\n 15  120\n 16  136\n 17  153\n 18  171\n 19  190\n```\nI initialize an empty list `[]`, then `append()` in each loop iteration. Can this be done in a more pythonic way?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve a running total in a more elegant and pythonic way using the `accumulate` function from the `itertools` module. This allows you to avoid manually updating and appending to the list. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import accumulate\n\na = range(20)\nrunningTotal = list(accumulate(a))\n\nfor i in zip(a, runningTotal):\n    print(\"{0:>3}{1:>5}\".format(*i))\n```\n\nIn this improved version:\n- We use `itertools.accumulate`, which automatically computes the running total of a given iterable.\n- `list(accumulate(a))` generates the running totals for the list `a`.\n- The rest of the code remains unchanged for printing the numbers and their running totals.\n\nThis approach is not only more concise but also leverages Python's built-in functionality to handle the accumulation, making it more efficient and readable."
