        "content": "Certainly! You can calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 in MATLAB using a simple loop or a direct mathematical formula. Here's a MATLAB code snippet using both methods:\n\n### Method 1: Using a Loop\n```matlab\ntotalSum = 0;\nfor i = 1:100\n    totalSum = totalSum + i;\nend\ndisp(['The sum of numbers from 1 to 100 is: ', num2str(totalSum)]);\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using the Formula\nYou can also use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\\[ \\text{Sum} = \\frac{n \\times (n + 1)}{2} \\]\nwhere \\( n \\) is the last number in the sequence.\n\n```matlab\nn = 100;\ntotalSum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;\ndisp(['The sum of numbers from 1 to 100 is: ', num2str(totalSum)]);\n```\n\nBoth methods will give you the result of 5050, which is the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100."
