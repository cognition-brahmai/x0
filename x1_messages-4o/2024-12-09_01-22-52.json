Is there a difference with the readline module in Lion? I'm not sure if terminal is ignoring readline or if it is python itself. To clarify, by tab completion, I mean being able to complete commands by pressing the tab key, like so:\n\n```python\n# django\nimport MyModel\nMyModel.objects.a[TAB] # will complete to all()\n```\nCould you help me resolve this issue? I am currently using Python version: 2.7.1."

        "content": "It sounds like you're experiencing issues with tab completion in Python's interactive shell on macOS Lion, which could be related to the `readline` module. This problem is relatively common due to differences in how the `readline` library is implemented on macOS.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to help you resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check if `readline` is Installed Properly:**\n   On macOS, the built-in `readline` might not work perfectly with Python. The solution is to use the `gnureadline` package instead. You can install it using `pip`.\n\n```bash\npip install gnureadline\n```\n\n2. **Create or Update Python Startup File:**\n   You can create a Python startup file that imports `gnureadline` and enables tab completion. This file is typically named `~/.pystartup`.\n\n   - Create or edit the `~/.pystartup` file:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import readline\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Module readline not available.\")\nelse:\n    import rlcompleter\n    readline.parse_and_bind(\"tab: complete\")\n```\n\n3. **Set the `PYTHONSTARTUP` Environment Variable:**\n   You need to point the `PYTHONSTARTUP` environment variable to your startup file. Add the following line to your shell's configuration file (e.g., `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc`):\n\n```bash\nexport PYTHONSTARTUP=~/.pystartup\n```\n\n4. **Reload the Shell Configuration:**\n   After editing your shell configuration file, you need to reload it. You can do this by either restarting the terminal or running:\n\n```bash\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n   or\n\n```bash\nsource ~/.zshrc\n```\n\n5. **Try the Python Shell Again:**\n   Open a new terminal session and start the Python interactive shell by typing `python`. Test if tab completion works by using the example you provided or any other module or object.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to enable tab completion in your Python interactive shell on macOS Lion. If you still encounter problems, ensure that your Python version and installed packages are correctly set up. You might also consider upgrading to a more recent version of Python, as Python 2.7 has reached the end of its life and is no longer maintained."
