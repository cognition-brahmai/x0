Here's a general approach to detect anagrams:\n\n1. **Normalize the Words**: Convert each word to a standard form. This typically involves:\n   - Converting all letters to lowercase to ensure uniformity.\n   - Sorting the characters in each word alphabetically. Anagrams will have the same sorted character sequence.\n\n2. **Grouping Words**: Utilize a dictionary (or hashmap) to group words. The key will be the normalized form (sorted character sequence) and the value will be a list of words that match this form.\n\n3. **Algorithm Steps**:\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary `anagram_groups`.\n   - Iterate through each word in the list:\n     - Normalize the word by sorting its characters.\n     - Use the normalized form as a key in the dictionary.\n     - Append the original word to the list of words for that key.\n   - After processing all words, the dictionary will contain groups of anagrams.\n\n4. **Extract Anagram Groups**: Iterate through the dictionary and extract lists that contain more than one word, as these are groups of anagrams.\n\nHere's a simple Python code to illustrate this approach:\n\n```python\ndef find_anagrams(word_list):\n    anagram_groups = {}\n\n    for word in word_list:\n        # Normalize the word by sorting its characters\n        normalized_word = ''.join(sorted(word.lower()))\n\n        # Use the normalized form as a key in the dictionary\n        if normalized_word in anagram_groups:\n            anagram_groups[normalized_word].append(word)\n        else:\n            anagram_groups[normalized_word] = [word]\n\n    # Extract groups of anagrams\n    return [group for group in anagram_groups.values() if len(group) > 1]\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"listen\", \"silent\", \"enlist\", \"hello\", \"world\"]\nanagrams = find_anagrams(words)\nprint(anagrams)\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n\n```\n[['listen', 'silent', 'enlist']]\n```\n\nThis approach efficiently groups and identifies anagrams using simple sorting and dictionary operations, which are computationally inexpensive and easy to implement."
