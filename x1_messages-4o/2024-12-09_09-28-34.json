        "content": "Sure, I can help you with that! If your current implementation calculates the sum of the elements and then multiplies it by the length of the array minus one, it may involve multiple passes over the array or unnecessary operations, depending on how it's implemented. \n\nHere's a more efficient way to do it in O(n) time complexity:\n\n```python\ndef optimized_sum(arr):\n    total_sum = 0\n    n = len(arr)\n    \n    for num in arr:\n        total_sum += num\n        \n    result = total_sum * (n - 1)\n    return result\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. We iterate over the array once to calculate the sum of all its elements (`total_sum`).\n2. After the loop, we multiply `total_sum` by `(n - 1)` to get the final result.\n\nThis approach ensures that you make only a single pass through the array, achieving O(n) time complexity. If your original implementation involved multiple passes or additional operations, this should be more efficient."
