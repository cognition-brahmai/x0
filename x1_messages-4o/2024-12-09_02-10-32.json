However, I'm having difficulty getting it to run on Atom which I'm not familiar with. How can I configure Atom to use Python located in the following directory: \"C:\\users\\engine\\anaconda3\\envs\\tensorflow\\python.exe\"? What package should I use considering that I'm using Windows and not virtualenv?"

You will need to install a package called `script` in Atom, which allows you to run scripts directly from the editor.\n\nHere's how you can set it up:\n\n1. **Install the Script Package:**\n   - Open Atom.\n   - Go to `File` > `Settings` (or `Edit` > `Preferences` on some systems).\n   - Click on `Install` in the sidebar.\n   - Search for `script` and click `Install` on the package by rgbkrk.\n\n2. **Configure Script to Use Your Python Interpreter:**\n   - Open a Python file in Atom.\n   - Click on `Packages` in the menu bar, and then `Script` > `Configure Script`.\n   - In the dialog that appears, you can specify the command to run your script. Change the command to use your specific Python interpreter by entering the full path: \n     ```\n     C:\\users\\engine\\anaconda3\\envs\\tensorflow\\python.exe\n     ```\n   - Save the configuration.\n\n3. **Run Your Script:**\n   - You can now run your Python scripts by opening your Python file, then going to `Packages` > `Script` > `Run Script`, or simply by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+B` (default shortcut).\n\nThis setup allows you to specify which Python interpreter to use, bypassing any default configurations. By using the `script` package, you can quickly test and run Python code directly within Atom, utilizing the specific Anaconda environment you have set up."
