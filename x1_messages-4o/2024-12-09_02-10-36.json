        "content": "Your code seems to have a few issues that could be causing the problem. Let me help you identify and fix them:\n\n1. **Print Statement Syntax (Python 3 Compatibility):**  \n   If you are using Python 3, the print statement should use parentheses. Change `print \"...\"` to `print(\"...\")`.\n\n2. **Handling Exceptions:**  \n   Your `except` block is generic and it doesn't provide information about what went wrong. It's better to catch specific exceptions or at least print the error message.\n\n3. **String Formatting:**  \n   When printing the conversion success message, `nameOnly` is a tuple. You should use `nameOnly[0]`.\n\nHere's the revised code with these adjustments:\n\n```python\ndef convertXLS2CSV(aFile):\n    '''converts a MS Excel file to csv w/ the same name in the same directory'''\n\n    print(\"------ beginning to convert XLS to CSV ------\")\n\n    try:\n        import win32com.client\n        import os\n        from win32com.client import constants as c\n        excel = win32com.client.Dispatch('Excel.Application')\n\n        fileDir, fileName = os.path.split(aFile)\n        nameOnly = os.path.splitext(fileName)\n        newName = nameOnly[0] + \".csv\"\n        outCSV = os.path.join(fileDir, newName)\n        workbook = excel.Workbooks.Open(aFile)\n        workbook.SaveAs(outCSV, c.xlCSVMSDOS)  # 24 represents xlCSVMSDOS\n        workbook.Close(False)\n        excel.Quit()\n        del excel\n\n        print(f\"...Converted {nameOnly[0]} to CSV\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\">>>>>>> FAILED to convert {aFile} to CSV!\")\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\nconvertXLS2CSV(\"G:\\\\hello.xlsx\")\n```\n\n**Additional Suggestions:**\n- Make sure that the file path (`\"G:\\\\hello.xlsx\"`) is correct and accessible.\n- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to read the Excel file and write the CSV file in the specified directory.\n- Since you're using `win32com.client`, this will only work on Windows with Excel installed.\n- Double-check if the Excel file you are trying to convert is not open or locked by another process."
