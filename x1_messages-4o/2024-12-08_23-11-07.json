(B)  \n\nThe clouds converge, a veil of mystery, (C)  \nAs thunder rumbles deep within their core, (D)  \nThe stars above, a timeless history, (C)  \nConceal the secrets that the night may store. (D)  \n\nThe wind begins to howl its eerie song, (E)  \nWhile lightning dances in a fleeting show, (F)  \nThe stars persist, though tempests grow so strong, (E)  \nTheir steadfast glow defies the storm's tableau. (F)  \n\nYet in this dance of dark and light, we see, (G)  \nThe sky holds secrets deep as any sea. (G)  "
