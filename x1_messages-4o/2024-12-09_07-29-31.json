When I try to verify with `which virtualenv` or try to use `virtualenv someDir`, I get no output or a command not found message respectively. I installed `pip` using `homebrew` and `virtualenv` with `pip` successfully, but reinstalling `virtualenv` did not work. Can you guide me on how to identify the path to add to `PATH`? Currently, I think `virtualenv.py` is installed in `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/virtualenv.py`. I have also tried the suggestion from a guide to create a symbolic link to `virtualenv` but it doesn't solve the issue. I am using Mac OSX 10.7.5 (Lion)."

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you resolve this:\n\n1. **Check the Installation Path:**\n   First, make sure `virtualenv` is actually installed by running:\n   ```bash\n   pip show virtualenv\n   ```\n   This will display information about the `virtualenv` package, including its location.\n\n2. **Locate the Virtualenv Executable:**\n   You can find the `virtualenv` executable by using the following command:\n   ```bash\n   find /usr/local -name 'virtualenv'\n   ```\n   This should help you locate where the `virtualenv` executable is installed.\n\n3. **Add to PATH:**\n   Once you've located the `virtualenv` executable, you need to add its directory to your `PATH`. If you found it in a directory like `/usr/local/bin`, you can add this directory to your `PATH` by modifying your shell profile file. For example, if you are using `bash`, you can edit `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc`:\n   ```bash\n   echo 'export PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bash_profile\n   ```\n   If you are using `zsh`, you should modify `~/.zshrc` instead.\n\n4. **Refresh Your Shell Environment:**\n   After modifying your shell profile, refresh the environment by running:\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bash_profile\n   ```\n   Or, if you modified `~/.zshrc`:\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.zshrc\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify the Installation:**\n   Try running:\n   ```bash\n   which virtualenv\n   ```\n   to verify that `virtualenv` is recognized and points to the correct path.\n\n6. **Reinstall if Necessary:**\n   If the above steps do not resolve the issue, you might want to try reinstalling `virtualenv`:\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall virtualenv\n   pip install virtualenv\n   ```\n\n7. **Check Python Version:**\n   Ensure that the version of Python you're using with `pip` is the version you expect. Sometimes, `pip` might be installing packages for a different Python version than the one you're using. You can specify the Python version explicitly:\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m pip install virtualenv\n   ```\n\n8. **Use Homebrew Python:**\n   If you are using the system Python, consider using the Python version installed via Homebrew, which might be located at `/usr/local/bin/python3`. You can switch to it by running:\n   ```bash\n   brew install python\n   ```\n\nThese steps should help you resolve the issue with `virtualenv` not being found. If you continue to have problems, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to assist further."
