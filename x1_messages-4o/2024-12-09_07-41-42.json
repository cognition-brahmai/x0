        "content": "To monitor the progress of the optimization process in `scipy.optimize`, you can use a callback function. This function is called after each iteration of the optimization algorithm, and you can use it to print out information about the current state of the optimization, such as the current best point and function value.\n\nHere's an example of how you might set this up using `scipy.optimize.minimize`:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\n# Example objective function\ndef objective_function(x):\n    return np.sum(x**2)\n\n# Callback function to track progress\ndef callback(xk):\n    # xk is the current parameter vector\n    print(f\"Current best point: {xk}\")\n    print(f\"Current best value: {objective_function(xk)}\")\n\n# Initial guess\nx0 = np.random.rand(12)\n\n# Run the optimizer with callback\nresult = minimize(objective_function, x0, method='BFGS', callback=callback)\n\n# Print final result\nprint(\"Optimization finished.\")\nprint(f\"Optimal parameters: {result.x}\")\nprint(f\"Optimal value: {result.fun}\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `callback` function is called at the end of each iteration. It receives the current estimate of the parameter vector `xk`, and you can use this to print information about the current best point and its corresponding objective function value.\n\nYou can modify the `callback` function to include more detailed progress information if you need it. Additionally, choosing an appropriate optimization method (e.g., `BFGS`, `L-BFGS-B`, etc.) and setting options such as `disp=True` can also help in displaying more detailed output, although the `disp` option typically provides information only after the optimization is complete rather than during each iteration."
