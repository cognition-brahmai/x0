For instance, if I have a list 'a' as shown below:\n\n```python\na= [(1,2),(1,4),(3,5),(5,7)]\n```\n\nHow can I find all the tuples that contain the number 1, which should give me the result:\n\n```python\nresult = [(1,2),(1,4)]\n```"

        "content": "To find all the tuples containing a specific number from a list of tuples in Python, you can use a list comprehension. Here is an example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\n# Given list of tuples\na = [(1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 5), (5, 7)]\n\n# Number you want to find in the tuples\ntarget_number = 1\n\n# Using list comprehension to find all tuples containing the target number\nresult = [tup for tup in a if target_number in tup]\n\n# Display the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code snippet will give you the desired output:\n\n```python\n[(1, 2), (1, 4)]\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- We iterate over each tuple in the list `a` using a list comprehension.\n- For each tuple, we check if the `target_number` (in this case, `1`) is present in the tuple.\n- If the number is found, the tuple is included in the resulting list `result`."
