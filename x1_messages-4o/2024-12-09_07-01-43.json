I want my package to be portable, so it can be loaded on a USB-stick and operate anywhere, irrespective of where the stick is mounted and whether Python is installed or not. However, when I use the shebang `#!../python`, it only works when the script is invoked from its directory. Is there a way to make the shebang use an interpreter relative to the script path, or is this not possible within the current shebang mechanism?"

        "content": "The shebang line (`#!`) in scripts is used to specify the path to the interpreter that should execute the script. However, the shebang mechanism itself does not support relative paths in the way you're describing. The path specified in the shebang must be an absolute path to the interpreter.\n\nIn your case, you want to run a script with a custom-built Python interpreter located in the parent directory relative to the script. Since the shebang doesn't support relative paths, you'll need to use a small workaround to achieve this functionality. Here's a potential solution:\n\n1. **Wrapper Script**: Create a small wrapper script that calculates the absolute path to the custom Python interpreter and then invokes your script. This can be done using a shell script or another Python script.\n\n2. **Example Wrapper Script**:\n   Let's say your custom Python interpreter is located in the parent directory of your script. You can create a shell script like this:\n\n   ```bash\n   #!/bin/bash\n\n   # Get the directory of the current script\n   SCRIPT_DIR=$(dirname \"$(realpath \"$0\")\")\n\n   # Calculate the parent directory\n   PARENT_DIR=$(dirname \"$SCRIPT_DIR\")\n\n   # Path to the custom Python interpreter\n   CUSTOM_PYTHON=\"$PARENT_DIR/python\"\n\n   # Execute the script with the custom Python interpreter\n   \"$CUSTOM_PYTHON\" \"$SCRIPT_DIR/your_script.py\" \"$@\"\n   ```\n\n   Save this wrapper script in the same directory as your Python script. Make it executable by running `chmod +x wrapper_script.sh`.\n\n3. **Usage**: Instead of directly running the Python script, you would run this wrapper script. The wrapper script calculates the path to the custom Python interpreter every time it's executed, ensuring it works regardless of where the USB stick is mounted.\n\n4. **Making the Wrapper Executable**: Ensure that your USB stick is formatted with a filesystem that supports Unix-style permissions (like ext4) to make the script executable, or use a filesystem-compatible approach to run the script.\n\nThis approach allows you to maintain the portability of your package and use a custom Python interpreter located relative to your script."
