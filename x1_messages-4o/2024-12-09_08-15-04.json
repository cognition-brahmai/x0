In the first cell, I use the magic command %matplotlib inline, and after running my code, the figure renders successfully. However, in the second cell, when I change the command to %matplotlib notebook for interactive plotting, the figure doesn't render. I am then required to restart the kernel and rerun the cell with %matplotlib notebook, without running the %matplotlib inline command before that. Why is this happening? Here is my code for the first cell:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n%matplotlib inline\n\nlabels = \"No\", \"Yes\"\nsizes = [100, 50]\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 6))\n\n_, texts, autotexts = ax.pie(sizes, explode=explode, labels=labels, colors=colors, autopct='%1.1f%%',\n         shadow=False, startangle=90)\n\nax.axis('equal')\n```\n\nIn the second cell, I use the same code, only changing %matplotlib inline to %matplotlib notebook. Despite this, the figure doesn't render and I have to restart the kernel and run the cell again."

        "content": "When you switch between `%matplotlib inline` and `%matplotlib notebook`, it can sometimes cause issues because these magic commands set up the backend for rendering plots. Each backend has different capabilities and they may not transition smoothly without restarting the kernel. Here's a detailed explanation and solution:\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **%matplotlib inline**:\n   - This backend is designed for static images and is perfect for inline plotting within Jupyter Notebooks. It displays static images of the plots below the code cells.\n\n2. **%matplotlib notebook**:\n   - This backend is designed for interactive plots, allowing you to zoom, pan, and resize plots directly in the notebook. It requires a live connection to the kernel, and switching to it from another backend without restarting the kernel can cause conflicts.\n\n### Solution:\n1. **Restart the Kernel**: Before switching from `%matplotlib inline` to `%matplotlib notebook`, restart the kernel. This ensures that the backend is properly initialized without any residual settings from the previous backend.\n\n2. **Consistent Backend Usage**: If you plan to use interactive plots throughout your notebook, it's best to start with `%matplotlib notebook` and stick with it. If you need to switch, do so strategically, knowing that a kernel restart might be necessary.\n\n3. **Combine Code Cells**: If you find it cumbersome to restart the kernel frequently, consider combining the plotting code into a single cell where you set the desired backend initially.\n\n4. **Alternative Interactive Backends**: If you continue to experience issues, consider using other interactive backends like `%matplotlib widget`, which may offer more stability and features for interactive plotting.\n\nHere's a modified approach to ensure smoother transitions:\n\n```python\n# Run this cell first to initialize the interactive backend\n%matplotlib notebook\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Plotting code\nlabels = \"No\", \"Yes\"\nsizes = [100, 50]\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 6))\nax.pie(sizes, labels=labels, autopct='%1.1f%%', shadow=False, startangle=90)\nax.axis('equal')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to switch between different matplotlib backends with minimal issues."
