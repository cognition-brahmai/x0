However, I'm encountering an error message that says 'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command. I have already set the path to where my Python is installed which is C:\\Program Files\\Python27. Despite this, the issue persists. How can I fix this?"

Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify Python Installation Path**: Ensure that Python is indeed installed in `C:\\Program Files\\Python27`. Double-check that the `python.exe` file is present in this directory.\n\n2. **Correct the PATH Environment Variable**:\n   - Open the Start Menu and search for \"Environment Variables.\"\n   - Click on \"Edit the system environment variables.\"\n   - In the System Properties window, click on the \"Environment Variables\" button.\n   - In the Environment Variables window, under the \"System variables\" section, find and select the `Path` variable, then click \"Edit.\"\n   - Make sure that `C:\\Program Files\\Python27` is included in the list of paths. If not, add it by clicking \"New\" and entering the path.\n   - Click \"OK\" to close all the windows.\n\n3. **Check for Other Python Installations**: If you have other versions of Python installed, they might be interfering with your current setup. Run `where python` in the command prompt to see if there are multiple Python installations. If there are, ensure that the correct path is prioritized in your PATH variable.\n\n4. **Restart Command Prompt**: After making changes to the PATH variable, close any open command prompt windows and open a new one to ensure the changes take effect.\n\n5. **Test the Configuration**: Open a new command prompt and type `python --version` to verify if the correct Python version is recognized.\n\n6. **Alternative Execution**: If the problem persists, you can try specifying the full path to the Python executable when running your script:\n   ```shell\n   \"C:\\Program Files\\Python27\\python.exe\" testloop.py\n   ```\n\nIf these steps do not resolve the issue, you may want to consider reinstalling Python and ensuring that the option to add Python to the system PATH is selected during installation."
