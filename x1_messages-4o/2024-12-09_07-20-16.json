I would like the app to show the progress of the download/upload each time a data chunk is downloaded, ideally as a numeric representation like a percentage. Also, I want to avoid erasing all the text that has been printed to the console in previous lines, meaning I do not want to \"clear\" the entire terminal while printing the updated progress."

        "content": "To implement a text progress bar in a terminal for your console application using Python, you can use block characters to visually represent the progress of file uploads and downloads. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this using Python's `ftplib` and some simple terminal control techniques:\n\n1. **Setup FTP Connection**: First, make sure you have a connection to the FTP server using `ftplib`.\n\n2. **Determine File Size**: To calculate the progress, you'll need to know the total size of the file being uploaded or downloaded.\n\n3. **Create a Progress Bar Function**: This function will update the progress bar displayed in the terminal each time a chunk of data is transferred.\n\n4. **Update the Progress Bar**: As data is transferred, update the progress bar without clearing the entire terminal.\n\nHere's a simple example of how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport ftplib\nimport sys\nimport os\n\ndef progress_bar(percentage, length=50):\n    \"\"\"Display progress bar in terminal.\"\"\"\n    complete_blocks = int(length * percentage // 100)\n    incomplete_blocks = length - complete_blocks\n    bar = '\u2588' * complete_blocks + '-' * incomplete_blocks\n    print(f\"\\r[{bar}] {percentage:.2f}%\", end='')\n\ndef upload_file(ftp, file_path, remote_path):\n    \"\"\"Upload a file to an FTP server and display progress.\"\"\"\n    file_size = os.path.getsize(file_path)\n    \n    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:\n        uploaded_bytes = 0\n        \n        def upload_callback(chunk):\n            nonlocal uploaded_bytes\n            uploaded_bytes += len(chunk)\n            percentage = uploaded_bytes / file_size * 100\n            progress_bar(percentage)\n        \n        ftp.storbinary(f'STOR {remote_path}', file, 1024, callback=upload_callback)\n    print()  # Move to the next line after completing progress\n\ndef download_file(ftp, remote_path, local_path):\n    \"\"\"Download a file from an FTP server and display progress.\"\"\"\n    file_size = ftp.size(remote_path)\n    \n    with open(local_path, 'wb') as file:\n        downloaded_bytes = 0\n        \n        def download_callback(chunk):\n            nonlocal downloaded_bytes\n            file.write(chunk)\n            downloaded_bytes += len(chunk)\n            percentage = downloaded_bytes / file_size * 100\n            progress_bar(percentage)\n        \n        ftp.retrbinary(f'RETR {remote_path}', callback=download_callback)\n    print()  # Move to the next line after completing progress\n\n# Example usage\nftp = ftplib.FTP('ftp.example.com')\nftp.login('username', 'password')\n\n# Upload a file\nupload_file(ftp, 'local_file.txt', 'remote_file.txt')\n\n# Download a file\ndownload_file(ftp, 'remote_file.txt', 'local_file_downloaded.txt')\n\nftp.quit()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Callback Functions**: `upload_callback` and `download_callback` are used to track the number of bytes transferred. They update the progress bar accordingly.\n- **Dynamic Progress Bar**: The `progress_bar` function uses terminal escape sequences (`\\r`) to overwrite the current line, rather than clearing the whole terminal.\n- **Block Characters**: The progress bar uses the `\u2588` character to visually represent the completion of the task, which is a solid block character ideal for terminal displays.\n- **File Size Tracking**: Ensure you handle files that may not have a known size, or manage errors in retrieving file sizes.\n\nThis setup provides a clear and interactive way to monitor file transfers in a terminal application without disrupting the rest of the terminal output."
