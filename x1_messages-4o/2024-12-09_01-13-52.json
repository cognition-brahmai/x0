        "content": "The error message you are encountering indicates that the `tkinter` module is not installed on your system. `tkinter` is a standard GUI toolkit for Python, but it may not be installed by default, especially if you are using Python 2.x on Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you should install the appropriate package that provides `tkinter` for the version of Python you are using. Here are the steps to do this:\n\n1. **For Python 2.x:**\n\n   If your code is using Python 2.x, you need to install the `python-tk` package. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install python-tk\n   ```\n\n2. **For Python 3.x:**\n\n   If your code is using Python 3.x, you need to install the `python3-tk` package. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install python3-tk\n   ```\n\nAfter installing the appropriate package, try running your code again. It should now be able to import the `tkinter` module without any issues.\n\nAdditionally, ensure that you are running your Python script with the correct version of Python. You can check your Python version by running:\n\n```bash\npython --version      # For Python 2\npython3 --version     # For Python 3\n```\n\nMake sure to use `python` or `python3` command accordingly when running your script:\n\n```bash\npython main.py        # Use if it's Python 2.x\npython3 main.py       # Use if it's Python 3.x\n```"
