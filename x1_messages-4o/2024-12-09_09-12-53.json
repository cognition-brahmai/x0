        "content": "Certainly! To find the roots of a polynomial, we need to first understand the polynomial equation. Given the coefficients 2, 3, and 6, it looks like you have a quadratic equation of the form:\n\n\\[ 2x^2 + 3x + 6 = 0 \\]\n\nTo find the roots of this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nwhere \\( a = 2 \\), \\( b = 3 \\), and \\( c = 6 \\).\n\nLet's calculate the discriminant (\\( b^2 - 4ac \\)) first:\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = 3^2 - 4 \\times 2 \\times 6 = 9 - 48 = -39 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, this means the roots are complex (not real). Let's proceed with the calculation:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{-39}}{4} \\]\n\nThe square root of \\(-39\\) can be expressed in terms of imaginary numbers:\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{-39} = i\\sqrt{39} \\]\n\nSo, the roots are:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{-3 \\pm i\\sqrt{39}}{4} \\]\n\nTherefore, the roots of the polynomial equation \\( 2x^2 + 3x + 6 = 0 \\) are complex:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{-3 + i\\sqrt{39}}{4} \\] and \\[ x = \\frac{-3 - i\\sqrt{39}}{4} \\]"
