        "content": "How can I create a new list based on an existing list in Python, repeating each value three times consecutively using list comprehension? I am currently using a for loop to accomplish this, but I want to implement it in a more Pythonic way. I tried using list comprehension and the * operator, but I am unable to unpack the tuples. Here's the code I've tried:\n\n```\nmy_list = [ 1, 2 ]\nthree_times = []\nfor i in range( len( my_list ) ):\n  for j in range( 3 ):\n    three_times.append( my_list[ i ] )\n\nprint three_times\n# Output: [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]\n\nmy_list = [ 1, 2 ]\nthree_times = []\nthree_times = [ (value,) * 3 for value in my_list ]\n\nprint three_times\n# Output: [(1, 1, 1), (2, 2, 2)]\n```\nI'd like something like `three_times = [ *( (value,) * 3 ) for value in my_list ]` but this doesn't work due to incorrect syntax. How can I resolve this?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired output using list comprehension, you can use the `for` clause inside the list comprehension to repeat each element three times. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nmy_list = [1, 2]\nthree_times = [value for value in my_list for _ in range(3)]\n\nprint(three_times)\n# Output: [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]\n```\n\nIn this code, the list comprehension iterates over each element in `my_list`, and for each element, it repeats it three times using a nested loop (`for _ in range(3)`). The underscore `_` is used as a throwaway variable since you don't actually need to use it within the loop. This approach effectively flattens the repeated values into a single list."
