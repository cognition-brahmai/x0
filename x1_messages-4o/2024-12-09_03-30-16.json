        "content": "In Python, I am attempting to implement a custom list class as a subclass of the built-in `list`. I have already overridden the `__getslice__`, `__add__` and `__mul__` methods, but I am unsure how to get extended slicing to return a `CustomList` type instead of a `list`. Are there any other list operations where the result will be of type `list` instead of `CustomList`? Here is the code I have currently:\n\n```python\nclass CustomList(list):\n    def __getslice__(self,i,j):\n        return CustomList(list.__getslice__(self, i, j))\n    def __add__(self,other):\n        return CustomList(list.__add__(self,other))\n    def __mul__(self,other):\n        return CustomList(list.__mul__(self,other))\n\nl = CustomList((1,2,3))\nl.append(4)                       \nl[0] = -1\nl[0:2] = CustomList((10,11))    \nl3 = l + CustomList((4,5,6))    \nl4 = 3*l                        \nl5 = l[0:2]                     \nl6 = l[0:2:2]                   \n```\n\nIn this code, `l6` is of type `list`, but I want it to be of type `CustomList`. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To ensure that slicing operations (including extended slicing) return an instance of `CustomList` instead of a `list`, you need to override the `__getitem__` method. The `__getslice__` method you used is deprecated in Python 3 in favor of `__getitem__` because slicing is now handled through the `__getitem__` method with slice objects.\n\nHere's how you can adjust your code:\n\n```python\nclass CustomList(list):\n    def __getitem__(self, index):\n        if isinstance(index, slice):\n            # If index is a slice, return a CustomList object\n            return CustomList(super().__getitem__(index))\n        else:\n            # Otherwise, return the normal item\n            return super().__getitem__(index)\n    \n    def __add__(self, other):\n        return CustomList(super().__add__(other))\n    \n    def __mul__(self, other):\n        return CustomList(super().__mul__(other))\n\n# Example usage\nl = CustomList((1, 2, 3))\nl.append(4)\nl[0] = -1\nl[0:2] = CustomList((10, 11))\nl3 = l + CustomList((4, 5, 6))\nl4 = 3 * l\nl5 = l[0:2]\nl6 = l[0:2:2]\n\nprint(type(l6))  # This should now print <class '__main__.CustomList'>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`__getitem__` Method**: By overriding `__getitem__`, you handle all indexing operations, including extended slicing. When a slice object is passed, you return a `CustomList` by calling `super().__getitem__(index)`, which gets the slice as a list, and then you convert it to `CustomList`.\n\n- **Use of `super()`**: We use `super()` to call the parent class (`list`) methods to ensure that the underlying list operations are still utilized.\n\nThis modification ensures that any slicing, whether simple or extended, will return an instance of `CustomList`."
