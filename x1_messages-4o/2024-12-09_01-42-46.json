I have a DataFrame with 'age', 'amount' and 'price' columns. When I plot the DataFrame using 'df.plot(kind='bar')', the prices are significantly higher than the amount which makes it difficult to identify the amount in the graph. I attempted to use a second y-axis by using 'df.loc[:,'amount'].plot(kind='bar')' and 'df.loc[:,'price'].plot(kind='bar',secondary_y=True)', but this just overwrites the bars and does not place them side-by-side. Is there a way to accomplish this without having to access the lower-level matplotlib?"

        "content": "To create a bar plot with two bars and two y-axes using pandas, where one bar represents the 'amount' and the other represents the 'price' for each age on the x-axis, you can use the following approach. This involves using matplotlib to manage the secondary axis and ensuring the bars are side-by-side.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'age': [20, 30, 40, 50],\n    'amount': [100, 200, 300, 400],\n    'price': [1000, 1500, 2000, 2500]\n}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Set the index to 'age' for proper labeling\ndf.set_index('age', inplace=True)\n\n# Create a new figure and axis\nfig, ax1 = plt.subplots()\n\n# Plot the 'amount' data\nax1.bar(df.index - 0.2, df['amount'], width=0.4, label='Amount', color='b')\nax1.set_ylabel('Amount', color='b')\nax1.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor='b')\n\n# Create a second y-axis for 'price'\nax2 = ax1.twinx()\nax2.bar(df.index + 0.2, df['price'], width=0.4, label='Price', color='r')\nax2.set_ylabel('Price', color='r')\nax2.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor='r')\n\n# Set the x-axis labels\nax1.set_xticks(df.index)\nax1.set_xticklabels(df.index)\n\n# Add legends\nax1.legend(loc='upper left')\nax2.legend(loc='upper right')\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.title('Amount and Price by Age')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Indexing**: Set the 'age' column as the index for easier plotting and labeling on the x-axis.\n- **Subplots**: Create a subplot with a primary y-axis (`ax1`) and a secondary y-axis (`ax2`) using `twinx()`.\n- **Offset Bars**: Offset the bars by adjusting the `x` positions to prevent overlap and ensure they are displayed side-by-side.\n- **Customization**: Adjust labels, colors, and legends to distinguish between the two datasets.\n\nThis setup provides a clear visualization with both the `amount` and `price` data, displaying each on its respective y-axis while aligning the bars side-by-side for better comparison."
