Here are a few ways you can do that:\n\n1. **Using the `exec` function:**\n\n   You can read the content of the Python file and then execute it using the `exec` function. Here's how you can do it:\n\n   ```python\n   with open('file.py') as f:\n       code = f.read()\n       exec(code)\n   ```\n\n2. **Using the `runpy` module:**\n\n   Python's `runpy` module allows you to run Python code as if it were an imported module. You can use it as follows:\n\n   ```python\n   import runpy\n   runpy.run_path('file.py')\n   ```\n\n3. **Using the `%run` magic command in IPython:**\n\n   If you're using IPython or Jupyter Notebook, you can use the `%run` magic command:\n\n   ```python\n   %run file.py\n   ```\n\n4. **Using the `import` statement:**\n\n   If the file is in the same directory or in your Python path, you can import it as a module:\n\n   ```python\n   import file\n   ```\n\n   Note: If you want to reload the file after making changes, you can use the `reload` function from the `importlib` module:\n\n   ```python\n   from importlib import reload\n   reload(file)\n   ```\n\nChoose the method that best fits your workflow and environment."
