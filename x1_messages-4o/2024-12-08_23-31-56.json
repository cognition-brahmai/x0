        "content": "A tropical rainforest biome is characterized by its lush, dense vegetation and high levels of biodiversity. It is typically found near the equator, where the climate is warm and humid year-round, with significant rainfall. The rainforest is structured in distinct layers including the emergent layer, canopy, understory, and forest floor, each supporting various species of flora and fauna. This biome is home to an immense variety of plants, animals, and insects, many of which are not found anywhere else on Earth. The rich ecosystem plays a crucial role in regulating the global climate and supporting the Earth's oxygen and carbon cycles."
