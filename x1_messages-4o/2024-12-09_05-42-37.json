I want to split a pandas dataframe into a training and test set, and stratify the data by multiple columns. However, I'm getting repeated rows in my final data set when I try to stratify by more than one column. Can you provide a solution for this problem? Here is the sample code I have been using:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\na = np.array([i for i in range(1000000)])\nb = [i%10 for i in a]\nc = [i%5 for i in a]\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'a':a, 'b':b, 'c':c})\n```\nWhen I try to stratify by either one of the columns, it works as expected:\n\n```python\ntrain, test = train_test_split(df, test_size=0.2, random_state=0, stratify=df[['b']])\nprint(len(train.a.values))  # prints 800000\nprint(len(set(train.a.values)))  # prints 800000\n\ntrain, test = train_test_split(df, test_size=0.2, random_state=0, stratify=df[['c']])\nprint(len(train.a.values))  # prints 800000\nprint(len(set(train.a.values)))  # prints 800000\n```\nHowever, when I try to stratify by both columns, I get repeated values:\n\n```python\ntrain, test = train_test_split(df, test_size=0.2, random_state=0, stratify=df[['b', 'c']])\nprint(len(train.a.values))  # prints 800000\nprint(len(set(train.a.values)))  # prints 640000\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering arises because `train_test_split` does not directly support stratifying with multiple columns when they are provided as a DataFrame. When you pass a DataFrame to the `stratify` parameter, it treats each row as a unique stratification class. If the combination of values in the columns is not unique, it may lead to duplicate entries in the stratified split.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can create a single stratification column that combines the multiple columns you want to stratify by. This can be done by concatenating the columns into a single string or using a tuple. This new column can then be used for stratification.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\n# Create the dataframe\na = np.array([i for i in range(1000000)])\nb = [i % 10 for i in a]\nc = [i % 5 for i in a]\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'a': a, 'b': b, 'c': c})\n\n# Create a new column by combining 'b' and 'c'\ndf['stratify_col'] = df['b'].astype(str) + '_' + df['c'].astype(str)\n\n# Use the new column for stratification\ntrain, test = train_test_split(df, test_size=0.2, random_state=0, stratify=df['stratify_col'])\n\n# Verify the split\nprint(len(train.a.values))  # Should print 800000\nprint(len(set(train.a.values)))  # Should print 800000\n```\n\nIn this code, we create a new column `stratify_col` that combines the values of columns `b` and `c` into a single string for each row. This ensures that the stratification respects the combination of values across both columns. Now you should see that there are no repeated entries in the training set."
