I want it to be grayscale because I need to draw on top of the image with color. I am using PIL's Image.open().convert() to read in the image and convert it to grayscale like so:\n```python\nimage = Image.open(file).convert(\"L\")\n```\nThen I convert the image to a matrix so that I can easily do some image processing using scipy.misc.fromimage():\n```python\nmatrix = scipy.misc.fromimage(image, 0)\n```\nHowever, when I try to display the image using:\n```python\nfigure()  \nmatplotlib.pyplot.imshow(matrix)  \nshow()\n```\nIt displays the image using a colormap (i.e. it's not grayscale). What am I doing wrong here?"

        "content": "The issue you are facing is due to the default behavior of `matplotlib.pyplot.imshow()` which applies a colormap to the image data unless specified otherwise. To display the image in grayscale, you need to set the `cmap` (colormap) parameter to `'gray'`. Additionally, `scipy.misc.fromimage()` is deprecated, and you should use `numpy.array()` to convert the image to a matrix. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Use `numpy.array()` to convert the PIL image to a matrix.\n2. Use `imshow()` with the `cmap='gray'` parameter to display the image in grayscale.\n\nHere's how your code should look:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Open and convert the image to grayscale\nimage = Image.open(file).convert(\"L\")\n\n# Convert the image to a matrix\nmatrix = np.array(image)\n\n# Display the image in grayscale\nplt.figure()\nplt.imshow(matrix, cmap='gray')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis should correctly display your image in grayscale, allowing you to draw colored elements on top of it."
