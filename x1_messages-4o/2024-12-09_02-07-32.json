How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To sort a pandas DataFrame by group aggregate and column, you can first compute the aggregated sums, merge these back to the original DataFrame, and then sort based on these aggregated values and the other column. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Creating the DataFrame\nrand = np.random.RandomState(1)\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'A': ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'] * 2,\n                   'B': rand.randn(6),\n                   'C': rand.rand(6) > .5})\n\n# Step 1: Compute the aggregated sum for each group in column 'A'\ngrouped = df.groupby('A', as_index=False)['B'].sum()\ngrouped = grouped.rename(columns={'B': 'B_sum'})\n\n# Step 2: Merge the aggregated sums back to the original DataFrame\ndf_merged = pd.merge(df, grouped, on='A')\n\n# Step 3: Sort by the aggregated sum of 'B' and then by 'C'\ndf_sorted = df_merged.sort_values(['B_sum', 'C'], ascending=[False, True])\n\n# Drop the temporary 'B_sum' column if not needed in the final output\ndf_sorted = df_sorted.drop(columns='B_sum')\n\nprint(df_sorted)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Group and Aggregate**: We first group the DataFrame by column 'A' and calculate the sum of 'B' for each group. The result is stored in a new DataFrame `grouped`.\n\n2. **Merge**: We merge this aggregated information back into the original DataFrame using the `merge` function. This adds a new column `B_sum` to the original DataFrame representing the sum of 'B' for each group.\n\n3. **Sort**: We then sort the DataFrame first by `B_sum` in descending order and then by `C` in ascending order using `sort_values`.\n\n4. **Cleanup**: Finally, we drop the `B_sum` column if it is not needed in the final output.\n\nThis will give you a DataFrame sorted according to the sum of 'B' in each group and then by 'C'."
