When I try to use the `docker-compose build` command, I encounter a `docker.errors.DockerException: Error while fetching server API version` error.

I'm using the following code:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/uhh-lt/158.git\ncd 158\ndocker-compose build\n```\n\nThe error message I'm getting is:\n\n```\nFile \"/home/ming/.local/bin/docker-compose\", line 8, in <module>\n    sys.exit(main())\n  File \"/home/ming/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/compose/cli/main.py\", line 67, in main\n    command()\n  File \"/home/ming/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/compose/cli/main.py\", line 123, in perform_command\n    project = project_from_options('.', options)\n  File \"/home/ming/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/compose/cli/command.py\", line 60, in project_from_options\n    return get_project(\n  File \"/home/ming/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/compose/cli/command.py\", line 131, in get_project\n    client = get_client(\n  File \"/home/ming/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/compose/cli/docker_client.py\", line 41, in get_client\n    client = docker_client(\n  File \"/home/ming/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/compose/cli/docker_client.py\", line 170, in docker_client\n    client = APIClient(**kwargs)\n  File \"/home/ming/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/docker/api/client.py\", line 188, in __init__\n    self._version = self._retrieve_server_version()\n  File \"/home/ming/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/docker/api/client.py\", line 212, in _retrieve_server_version\n    raise DockerException(\ndocker.errors.DockerException: Error while fetching server API version: ('Connection aborted.', FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory'))\n```\n\nIt seems like I'm unable to connect to my Docker even after starting it successfully.

        "content": "The error you're encountering (`docker.errors.DockerException: Error while fetching server API version`) typically indicates that the Docker client is unable to communicate with the Docker daemon. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Docker Daemon is Running:**\n   - Make sure that the Docker daemon is actually running. You can check its status with the following command:\n     ```bash\n     systemctl status docker\n     ```\n   - If it's not running, start it with:\n     ```bash\n     sudo systemctl start docker\n     ```\n\n2. **Check Docker Service Logs:**\n   - If the Docker daemon is not starting, check the logs to identify any issues:\n     ```bash\n     journalctl -u docker.service\n     ```\n\n3. **Check Docker Socket:**\n   - Verify that the Docker socket file exists and has the correct permissions:\n     ```bash\n     ls -l /var/run/docker.sock\n     ```\n   - The socket should typically have permissions like `srw-rw----` and be owned by `root` and the `docker` group. If not, you can adjust the permissions:\n     ```bash\n     sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock\n     ```\n\n4. **Verify Docker Group Membership:**\n   - Ensure your user is a member of the `docker` group, which allows you to run Docker commands without `sudo`:\n     ```bash\n     groups\n     ```\n   - If `docker` is not listed, add your user to the group:\n     ```bash\n     sudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n     ```\n   - Log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.\n\n5. **Docker Compose Version:**\n   - Make sure you are using a compatible version of `docker-compose` with your Docker version. You can check the version with:\n     ```bash\n     docker-compose --version\n     ```\n\n6. **Docker Environment Variables:**\n   - Check if there are any environment variables that might be misconfigured, such as `DOCKER_HOST`. You can list environment variables with:\n     ```bash\n     env | grep DOCKER\n     ```\n   - If `DOCKER_HOST` is pointing to an incorrect address, unset it:\n     ```bash\n     unset DOCKER_HOST\n     ```\n\n7. **Reinstall Docker:**\n   - If none of the above solutions work, consider reinstalling Docker. First, remove it:\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc\n     ```\n   - Then, install it again following the official Docker installation instructions for your OS.\n\n8. **Restart System:**\n   - Sometimes, a simple system restart can resolve lingering issues with services or permissions.\n\nAfter performing these steps, try running `docker-compose build` again to see if the issue is resolved. Let me know if you encounter any further problems."
