However, when I click on the submit button, I get a `POST 405 error Method Not Allowed`. Why isn't it displaying \"Hello\"?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to a mismatch between the form's `action` attribute and the route specified in your Flask app. In your Flask route, you have defined the endpoint as `/template`, but in your HTML form, the `action` attribute is set to `/`. Therefore, when you submit the form, it is sending a POST request to the root URL `/` instead of the `/template` URL.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you have two options:\n\n1. **Change the form's action to match the route:**\n\n   Update the `action` attribute in your HTML form to match the route defined in your Flask app:\n\n   ```html\n   <form action=\"/template\" method=\"post\">\n   ```\n\n   This way, when you submit the form, it will send a POST request to `/template`, which is the correct endpoint.\n\n2. **Change the Flask route to match the form's action:**\n\n   Alternatively, you can change the route in your Flask app to match the form's action attribute:\n\n   ```python\n   @app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\n   ```\n\n   This will make the root URL `/` handle both GET and POST requests, and your form submission will work as expected.\n\nAfter making one of these changes, your form should successfully submit and display \"Hello\" when you click the submit button."
