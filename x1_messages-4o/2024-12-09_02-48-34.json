The URLs could be like:\n\n```\nhttp://m3u.com/tunein.m3u\nhttp://asxsomeurl.com/listen.asx:8024\nhttp://www.plssomeotherurl.com/station.pls?id=111\nhttp://22.198.133.16:8024\n```\nThe first three URLs have file extensions (.m3u, .asx, .pls) but the last one does not. I am interested in the m3u, asx, pls extensions specifically as they are playlists (textfiles) for audio streams and need to be parsed differently. I am looking for a method `GetExtension()` that would return the file extension (if any) without actually connecting to the URL. Here is an outline of my intended usage:\n\n```python\nurl = argv[1]\next = GetExtension(url)\nif ext == \"pls\":\n  realurl = ParsePLS(url)\nelif ext == \"asx\":\n  realurl = ParseASX(url)\n(etc.)\nelse:\n  realurl = url\nPlay(realurl)\n```\nWhat's the best way to write the `GetExtension()` function?"

        "content": "To create a `GetExtension()` function that extracts the file extension from a URL, you can utilize Python's `urllib.parse` module to parse the URL and then string manipulation to find the extension. Here's a simple implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse\n\ndef GetExtension(url):\n    # Parse the URL to extract the path\n    parsed_url = urlparse(url)\n    path = parsed_url.path\n    \n    # Check if the path has an extension\n    if '.' in path:\n        # Extract the extension\n        extension = path.rsplit('.', 1)[1]\n        return extension\n    else:\n        return None\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    urls = [\n        \"http://m3u.com/tunein.m3u\",\n        \"http://asxsomeurl.com/listen.asx:8024\",\n        \"http://www.plssomeotherurl.com/station.pls?id=111\",\n        \"http://22.198.133.16:8024\"\n    ]\n    \n    for url in urls:\n        ext = GetExtension(url)\n        if ext:\n            print(f\"The extension for {url} is: {ext}\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"The URL {url} has no extension.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Parsing the URL**: The `urlparse()` function is used to break down the URL into its components like scheme, netloc, path, etc.\n- **Extracting the Path**: The path component of the URL is where the file name and extension reside.\n- **Finding the Extension**: If there's a period (`.`) in the path, we assume the portion following the last period is the extension. We use `rsplit('.', 1)` to split the string from the right, ensuring we only split into two parts: the base and the extension.\n- **Handling No Extension**: If no period is found in the path, the function returns `None`, indicating that no extension is present.\n\nThis function should work for your URLs and help in determining the correct extension for further processing."
