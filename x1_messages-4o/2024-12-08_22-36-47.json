This prevents ink from setting into the board surface.\n   - **Wipe with Microfiber Cloth**: Lightly dampen the microfiber cloth with water and wipe the board to remove any remaining residue.\n\n2. **Weekly Deep Cleaning**:\n   - **Apply Whiteboard Cleaner**: Spray a small amount of whiteboard cleaner onto a microfiber cloth (not directly on the board to avoid over-saturation).\n   - **Wipe the Surface**: Gently wipe the entire board with the cloth in a circular motion to lift any stubborn stains or ghosting marks.\n   - **Dry the Board**: Use a dry part of the microfiber cloth to dry the board thoroughly.\n\n3. **Monthly Maintenance**:\n   - **Inspect for Stains**: Check for any remaining stains or ghosting and address them with a more thorough application of cleaner if necessary.\n   - **Condition the Board**: Use a whiteboard conditioner or restorer occasionally to maintain the board's surface integrity and prevent ghosting.\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- **Avoid Abrasive Materials**: Never use abrasive pads, harsh chemicals, or rough cloths, as these can scratch and damage the board surface.\n- **Immediate Cleaning**: Clean any permanent marker stains immediately with a whiteboard cleaner or by writing over them with a dry erase marker and erasing promptly.\n- **Proper Marker Use**: Ensure only dry erase markers are used on the board to prevent staining.\n- **Regular Assessment**: Regularly check for any signs of wear and replace erasers or cloths when they become dirty or ineffective.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can maintain your classroom whiteboard in excellent condition for optimal use and longevity."
