The TfidfVectorizer is already pre-trained, so when I call pipeline.fit(X, y), I only want the LinearRegression to be fitted and not the TfidfVectorizer. I understand that I could just apply the transformation in advance and fit the LinearRegression on the transformed data, but in my project, I have many transformers in the pipeline, some of which are pre-trained and some of which are not. Is there a way to avoid writing another wrapper around sklearn estimators and stay within the bounds of one Pipeline object? Ideally, I would like there to be a parameter in the estimators object that prevents refitting when .fit() is called if the object is already fitted.\n\nCode:\n```\npipeline = make_pipeline(\n    TfidfVectorizer(),\n    LinearRegression()\n)\n```"

        "content": "To achieve this functionality within a single `Pipeline` object while maintaining the flexibility of handling both pre-trained and non-pre-trained transformers, you can create a custom transformer that respects a \"fit\" flag. By using this approach, you can control whether each transformer in the pipeline should be fitted or not.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n1. Create a custom transformer that wraps around your `TfidfVectorizer` with a `fit` parameter.\n2. Use this custom transformer in your pipeline.\n\nHere's an example of how you could implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.base import TransformerMixin, BaseEstimator\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nimport numpy as np\n\nclass PretrainedTfidfVectorizer(TransformerMixin, BaseEstimator):\n    def __init__(self, vectorizer=None, fit=False):\n        self.vectorizer = vectorizer if vectorizer else TfidfVectorizer()\n        self.fit = fit\n\n    def fit(self, X, y=None):\n        if self.fit:\n            self.vectorizer.fit(X)\n        return self\n\n    def transform(self, X):\n        return self.vectorizer.transform(X)\n\n# Assuming you have a pre-trained TfidfVectorizer\npretrained_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\n# ... fit the pretrained_vectorizer on your data ...\n\n# Use the custom transformer in the pipeline\npipeline = make_pipeline(\n    PretrainedTfidfVectorizer(vectorizer=pretrained_vectorizer, fit=False),\n    LinearRegression()\n)\n\n# Now, when you call pipeline.fit(), only the LinearRegression will be fitted\nX = [\"sample text data\", \"more text data\"]\ny = np.array([1, 2])\n\npipeline.fit(X, y)\n```\n\nIn this setup, the `PretrainedTfidfVectorizer` class acts as a wrapper around the `TfidfVectorizer`, allowing you to control whether it should be fitted when `pipeline.fit()` is called. By setting `fit=False`, you ensure that the vectorizer's fit method is not called, thereby preserving its pre-trained state. You can apply similar logic to other transformers in your pipeline."
