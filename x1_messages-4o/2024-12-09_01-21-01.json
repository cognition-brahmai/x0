But currently, when I click the button, it freezes for 5 seconds and then the progress bar is displayed without any oscillation. I understood from Bryan Oakley's solution that I need to use threads to prevent the GUI from freezing. I tried creating a thread but it didn\u2019t help as it was started from within the main thread. I am thinking of putting the logic portion in a different class and instantiate the GUI from within that class. But I am unable to figure out how to write the code in a way that the command for the start button (self.test_button = Button(self.master, command=self.tb_click)) calls a function located in the other class. Is this a feasible solution or should I handle the thread within the single GUI class? How do I create a thread that doesn't interfere with the main thread?"

        "content": "To address the issue of the Tkinter GUI freezing, you need to run the long-running task (in this case, updating the progress bar) in a separate thread. However, Tkinter isn't thread-safe, meaning you can't update the GUI directly from a secondary thread. Instead, you'll have to communicate between the thread and the main thread using a thread-safe mechanism. Here's a way to do it using the `threading` module and Tkinter's `after` method:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Create a Separate Thread for the Task:**\n   Use the `threading.Thread` to handle the task that takes time, such as the progress bar updating.\n\n2. **Use Tkinter's `after` Method:**\n   Since you can't directly update the GUI from a different thread, use Tkinter's `after` method to schedule updates on the main thread.\n\n3. **Design the Code Structure:**\n   You can keep the logic within the same class or separate them as you prefer. For simplicity, I'll show you how to handle this within a single class.\n\nHere's a sample code implementation:\n\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\nfrom tkinter import ttk\nimport threading\nimport time\n\nclass ProgressBarApp:\n    def __init__(self, master):\n        self.master = master\n        self.master.title(\"Progress Bar Example\")\n        \n        # Set up the progress bar\n        self.progress = ttk.Progressbar(master, orient=\"horizontal\", length=300, mode=\"indeterminate\")\n        self.progress.pack(pady=20)\n        \n        # Set up the start button\n        self.start_button = tk.Button(master, text=\"Start\", command=self.start_progress)\n        self.start_button.pack(pady=10)\n        \n    def start_progress(self):\n        # Start the progress bar oscillation in a new thread\n        threading.Thread(target=self.run_task).start()\n\n    def run_task(self):\n        self.progress.start()  # Start the progress bar animation\n        \n        # Simulate a task that takes 5 seconds\n        time.sleep(5)\n        \n        # Stop the progress bar after 5 seconds\n        self.master.after(0, self.progress.stop)\n\ndef main():\n    root = tk.Tk()\n    app = ProgressBarApp(root)\n    root.mainloop()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`self.progress.start()`**: Begins the oscillation of the progress bar. It's called from the main thread through the `start_progress` method.\n  \n- **`threading.Thread(target=self.run_task).start()`**: A new thread is created to handle the time-consuming task (`run_task` method). This prevents the GUI from freezing.\n\n- **`time.sleep(5)`**: Simulates a long-running task by pausing execution for 5 seconds.\n\n- **`self.master.after(0, self.progress.stop)`**: Schedules the `stop` method of the progress bar to be called on the main thread after the sleep completes. This ensures that the GUI updates are made on the main thread, maintaining thread safety.\n\nThis approach should solve the freezing issue and provide the desired behavior of starting and stopping the progress bar without freezing the GUI."
