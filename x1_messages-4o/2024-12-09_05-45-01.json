Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\ndraw = ImageDraw.Draw(pilImage)\ndraw.line((100,200, 150,300), fill=128)\n```\n\nBefore drawing the line, I was able to display the image using `imshow(pilImage)`. However, after drawing the line, `imshow(draw)` does not display the image. How can I convert this back to a PIL image so that I can display the image with the line drawn on it?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that you are trying to pass the `ImageDraw` object to `imshow`, which is not the correct approach. The `ImageDraw` object is used for drawing on the image, but to display the image, you should still use the original `PIL` image object (`pilImage` in your case).\n\nHere's how you can properly display the image after drawing the line:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image, ImageDraw\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Assuming pilImage is your initial image\n# Create a Draw object\ndraw = ImageDraw.Draw(pilImage)\n\n# Draw a line on the image\ndraw.line((100, 200, 150, 300), fill=128)\n\n# Display the image using matplotlib\nplt.imshow(pilImage)\nplt.axis('off')  # Optional, to hide axis\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this code, you are using `matplotlib.pyplot` to display the image. The `imshow` function is part of `matplotlib`, which is commonly used for displaying images in Python. After drawing on the image with `ImageDraw.Draw`, you continue to use the same `pilImage` object to display the updated image with the line."
