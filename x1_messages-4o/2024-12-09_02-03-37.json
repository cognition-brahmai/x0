In these tests, I need to verify that certain dictionaries contain at least certain attributes that are equal to specific values. Extra values in the dictionaries would be acceptable. I was considering using `assertDictContainsSubset` but it is deprecated. Is there a more recommended alternative that I should use? Or should I recursively assert the contents to be equal if they are present in the target dictionary? The Python documentation suggests using `addTypeEqualityFunc`, but it does not suit my needs as I would still like to use the normal `assertEqual` for dicts in certain cases."

        "content": "Instead of using `assertDictContainsSubset`, which is deprecated, you can create a custom assertion method in your test case to handle the requirement of checking if a dictionary contains at least certain attributes with specific values. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\nclass MyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):\n\n    def assertDictContainsSubset(self, subset, dictionary, msg=None):\n        \"\"\"Check whether dictionary contains a subset with expected key-value pairs.\"\"\"\n        for key, value in subset.items():\n            if key in dictionary:\n                self.assertEqual(dictionary[key], value, msg)\n            else:\n                self.fail(msg or f\"Key '{key}' not found in the dictionary.\")\n\n    def test_example(self):\n        # Example usage\n        expected_subset = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}\n        actual_dict = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2', 'key3': 'value3'}\n\n        self.assertDictContainsSubset(expected_subset, actual_dict)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Custom Assertion Method**: The `assertDictContainsSubset` method iterates over the key-value pairs of the subset dictionary and checks if each key exists in the target dictionary, and whether the values match. If a key is missing, it raises a failure.\n  \n- **Flexibility**: This method maintains flexibility, allowing you to use `assertEqual` or other assertions for full equality checks when needed.\n\n- **Use of `msg`**: A custom message can be passed to provide more context in case of a failure.\n\nThis approach keeps your tests clean and understandable, while ensuring that the dictionaries contain the required key-value pairs without being affected by additional keys in the actual dictionary."
