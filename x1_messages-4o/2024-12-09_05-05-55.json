I'm currently writing some documentation using ReStructuredText (ReST) format for web-page generation using Sphinx. I've found ways to create italic text with `*italic text*` and bold text with `**bold text**`. However, when I try to nest these formatting markers, such as `***text***` or `** *text* **`, it doesn't produce bold italic text. Is there a way to achieve this?"

        "content": "In ReStructuredText (ReST), to format text as both bold and italic, you need to use a combination of the strong emphasis and emphasis roles explicitly. Unfortunately, ReST does not support the direct nesting of asterisks for combined bold and italic formatting like Markdown does.\n\nTo achieve bold and italic text in ReST, you can use interpreted text roles. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```rst\n:strong:`*italic and bold text*`\n```\n\nOr, using the `emphasis` role along with `strong`:\n\n```rst\n**:emphasis:`bold and italic text`**\n```\n\nThese approaches apply the desired formatting by explicitly using the roles for emphasis within the context of strong emphasis or vice versa. Make sure your Sphinx or ReST parser supports these roles, as some might require additional configuration or extensions."
