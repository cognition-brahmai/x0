The error message is \"zsh: command not found: python\". I am currently using Python 3.10.3, with the Atom IDE, and I run the code in the terminal via the atom-python-run package. The error seems to be occurring because the terminal is calling for 'python' instead of 'python3'. I have attempted several solutions such as reinstalling the Python interpreter, using the 'alias python='python3'' command, modifying the path with the 'export PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\"' command, and even resetting zsh and paths by deleting associated hidden files in '/local/users/'. However, none of these steps have resolved the issue. How can I fix this?"

        "content": "It sounds like you're experiencing a common issue where the default Python command (`python`) is not recognized in your shell because macOS Monterey might not come with Python 2 pre-installed, and the command `python` typically links to Python 2.x. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify Python Installation**: First, ensure that Python 3.10.3 is properly installed and accessible through the command line. You can do this by typing `python3 --version` in the terminal.\n\n2. **Update Atom-Python-Run Package**: Ensure that your `atom-python-run` package is configured to use `python3` instead of `python`. You might need to adjust the settings or configuration files within Atom to explicitly call `python3`.\n\n3. **Create a Shell Alias**: If you haven't already done so, create a permanent alias for `python` to `python3` by adding the following line to your `~/.zshrc` file:\n\n   ```bash\n   alias python='python3'\n   ```\n\n   After adding this line, run `source ~/.zshrc` to reload the configuration.\n\n4. **Check PATH Configuration**: Ensure that the path to Python 3 is correctly set. You can add the following line to your `~/.zshrc` to prioritize the directory where Python 3 is installed:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\"\n   ```\n\n   Again, remember to run `source ~/.zshrc` after making changes.\n\n5. **Use a Symbolic Link**: If the above steps don't work, you can create a symbolic link for `python` to point to `python3`. Run the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/python\n   ```\n\n   Note that you might need to adjust the path `/usr/local/bin/python3` if your Python 3 executable is located elsewhere. You can find the correct path by running `which python3`.\n\n6. **Reinstall Python via Homebrew** (If applicable): If Python was installed using Homebrew, you can try reinstalling it:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew uninstall python\n   brew install python\n   ```\n\n7. **Check Atom's Script Execution**: Verify that the script execution configuration in Atom is set up to use `python3`. Some Atom packages allow you to specify the interpreter directly in their settings.\n\n8. **Restart Your Terminal and Atom**: After making these changes, restart your terminal and Atom to ensure all configurations are loaded correctly.\n\nFollowing these steps should help resolve the issue of `zsh: command not found: python` by ensuring that any invocation of `python` in your terminal defaults to `python3`."
