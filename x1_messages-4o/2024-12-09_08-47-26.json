Here are some popular methods and tools:\n\n1. **Beautiful Soup**: A Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates parse trees that help extract data easily.\n\n2. **Selenium**: A tool that automates web browsers. It's particularly useful for scraping dynamic content that requires JavaScript execution.\n\n3. **Scrapy**: An open-source web crawling framework for Python. It's powerful and efficient for large-scale web scraping projects.\n\n4. **Requests**: A simple Python library for making HTTP requests, which can be used to fetch the HTML content of web pages.\n\n5. **Puppeteer**: A Node.js library that provides a high-level API over the Chrome DevTools Protocol. Useful for scraping dynamic web pages by rendering JavaScript.\n\n6. **Cheerio**: A fast, flexible, and lean implementation of core jQuery designed specifically for the server, used in Node.js environments to parse and manipulate HTML.\n\nEach of these tools has its own strengths and is suitable for different types of web scraping tasks, depending on the complexity and requirements of the project."
