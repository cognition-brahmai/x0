        "content": "Certainly! You can create a custom function in Python to achieve this rounding down to the nearest multiple of an integer. Here's a simple function that does exactly that:\n\n```python\ndef round_down(number, base):\n    return number - (number % base)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(round_down(19, 10))  # Output: 10\nprint(round_down(19, 5))   # Output: 15\nprint(round_down(10, 10))  # Output: 10\n```\n\nThis function, `round_down`, takes two parameters: `number` and `base`. It calculates the remainder of the division of `number` by `base` using the modulus operator `%` and subtracts this remainder from `number`. This effectively rounds down `number` to the nearest multiple of `base`."
