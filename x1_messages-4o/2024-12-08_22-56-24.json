The remaining cells contain the products of the corresponding row and column numbers.\n\n```\n    |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |\n----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n 1  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |\n 2  |  2  |  4  |  6  |  8  | 10  | 12  |\n 3  |  3  |  6  |  9  | 12  | 15  | 18  |\n 4  |  4  |  8  | 12  | 16  | 20  | 24  |\n 5  |  5  | 10  | 15  | 20  | 25  | 30  |\n 6  |  6  | 12  | 18  | 24  | 30  | 36  |\n```\n\nIn Excel, you would typically create this by:\n\n1. Entering numbers 1 through 6 in cells B1 through G1 for the column headers.\n2. Entering numbers 1 through 6 in cells A2 through A7 for the row headers.\n3. Filling in the remaining cells with the product of the values from the corresponding row and column headers. For example, the cell at B2 would contain the formula `=B$1*$A2`. \n\nIf you need to create this in an Excel file, you would simply input these values and formulas accordingly."
