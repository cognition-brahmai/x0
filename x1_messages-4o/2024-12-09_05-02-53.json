        "content": "To handle Google API credentials securely on Heroku without uploading the JSON file, you can store the credentials in an environment variable, as you've done, and then manage the refresh process in memory. This approach ensures that sensitive information is not written to disk and remains secure.\n\nHere's a refined approach to managing Google API credentials using environment variables:\n\n1. **Store JSON Credentials in Environment Variable:** Ensure that the entire JSON content of your Google API credentials is stored in an environment variable, e.g., `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`.\n\n2. **Use In-Memory Storage for Credentials:** Instead of writing updated credentials to a file, you can update the environment variable directly.\n\n3. **Handle Credential Refresh Logic:** When credentials are invalid, refresh them and update the environment variable.\n\nHere's a sample implementation:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport json\nfrom google.oauth2 import service_account\nfrom google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow\nfrom google.auth.transport.requests import Request\n\ndef get_credentials():\n    credentials_json = os.environ['GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS']\n    credentials_info = json.loads(credentials_json)\n    credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_info(credentials_info)\n\n    # If credentials are invalid, refresh them\n    if not credentials or not credentials.valid:\n        # Use InstalledAppFlow for user authorization\n        flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_info(\n            credentials_info, scopes=['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar']\n        )\n        credentials = flow.run_local_server(port=0)\n\n        # Update the environment variable with new credentials\n        updated_credentials_json = credentials.to_json()\n        os.environ['GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS'] = updated_credentials_json\n\n    return credentials\n```\n\n### Key Steps in the Implementation:\n\n- **Service Account Credentials:** Use `service_account.Credentials` to handle the credentials directly from the JSON information stored in the environment variable.\n- **Credential Refresh:** Use `InstalledAppFlow` to obtain new credentials when the current ones are invalid. This is more typical for user-based OAuth flows, but the concept applies for refreshing.\n- **Update Environment Variable:** After obtaining new credentials, convert them to JSON and update the environment variable directly. This keeps the credentials refreshed in memory.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- **Security:** Ensure that your environment variables are well-protected on Heroku. Use the Heroku Dashboard or CLI to set them securely.\n- **Credential Scopes:** Ensure the scopes you request match your application's needs. This example uses `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar` for Google Calendar.\n\nBy following this approach, you maintain security by avoiding writing sensitive data to disk and instead handling everything in memory and through environment variables."
