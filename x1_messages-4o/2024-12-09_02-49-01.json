I have been using CountVectorizer to count the frequency of tokens extracted from a set of keywords, as shown below:\n\n```python\ntags = [\n  \"python, tools\",\n  \"linux, tools, ubuntu\",\n  \"distributed systems, linux, networking, tools\",\n]\n\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\nvec = CountVectorizer(tokenizer=tokenize)\ndata = vec.fit_transform(tags).toarray()\nprint data\n```\n\nThe output I get is:\n\n```python\n[[0 0 0 1 1 0]\n [0 1 0 0 1 1]\n [1 1 1 0 1 0]]\n```\n\nHowever, I would like to use the extracted features to count the frequency in a different set of documents. For example, for the following set of documents:\n\n```python\nlist_of_new_documents = [\n  [\"python, chicken\"],\n  [\"linux, cow, ubuntu\"],\n  [\"machine learning, bird, fish, pig\"]\n]\n```\n\nI want to get the following output:\n\n```python\n[[0 0 0 1 0 0]\n [0 1 0 0 0 1]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\n```\n\nI have been trying to use the vocabulary argument of the CountVectorizer class, but haven't been able to achieve this. Could you provide some guidance on how to do this?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this by using the `vocabulary_` attribute of the `CountVectorizer` after fitting it on your initial set of tags. This attribute contains the mapping of terms to feature indices, which you can use to transform new documents with the same feature space.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Fit the `CountVectorizer` on the initial set of tags to learn the vocabulary.\n2. Use the `vocabulary_` attribute to transform the new set of documents.\n\nHere's the step-by-step implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n\n# Define a simple tokenizer function to split the tags\ndef tokenize(text):\n    return text.split(', ')\n\n# Initial set of tags\ntags = [\n  \"python, tools\",\n  \"linux, tools, ubuntu\",\n  \"distributed systems, linux, networking, tools\",\n]\n\n# Initialize CountVectorizer and fit on the initial tags\nvec = CountVectorizer(tokenizer=tokenize)\nvec.fit(tags)\n\n# Check the vocabulary\nprint(\"Vocabulary:\", vec.vocabulary_)\n\n# New list of documents\nlist_of_new_documents = [\n  \"python, chicken\",\n  \"linux, cow, ubuntu\",\n  \"machine learning, bird, fish, pig\"\n]\n\n# Transform the new documents using the learned vocabulary\nnew_data = vec.transform(list_of_new_documents).toarray()\n\n# Output the frequency matrix for the new documents\nprint(new_data)\n```\n\nThis will give you the desired output:\n\n```python\n[[0 0 0 1 0 0]\n [0 1 0 0 0 1]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\n```\n\nThe key here is using the `fit` method on the original tags to build the vocabulary and then using the `transform` method on the new documents to apply this vocabulary, ensuring that only the tokens present in the original tags are considered in the frequency counts."
