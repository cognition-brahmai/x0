However, I am looking to enhance the output even further by adding colors to it, similar to the output of 'cat foo.json | jq '.' using 'jq', the JSON Swiss Army toolbox. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To achieve colored pretty printing of JSON in Python, similar to the output you get with `jq`, you can use the `rich` library, which is a great tool for rendering styled console output, including syntax-highlighted JSON.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. First, make sure you have the `rich` library installed. You can install it via pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install rich\n   ```\n\n2. Use the `rich` library to print your JSON object with colors:\n\n   ```python\n   import json\n   from rich import print_json\n\n   # Your JSON object\n   obj = {\n       \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n       \"age\": 30,\n       \"city\": \"New York\"\n   }\n\n   # Convert the object to a JSON string\n   json_str = json.dumps(obj, sort_keys=True, indent=4)\n\n   # Use rich to print the JSON with colors\n   print_json(json_str)\n   ```\n\nThe `print_json` function from the `rich` library automatically handles syntax highlighting, making it a great choice for colorful JSON output in the terminal. This will give you a similar effect to using `jq` for pretty printing JSON with colors."
