Can you provide a more extensive prompt that solicits information on the background and context leading up to the offending behavior and any potential underlying issues? In addition, can the Ruby code incorporate a more comprehensive approach to expressing sincere regret, including acknowledging the harm caused and taking accountability for the actions? Furthermore, can the code provide a detailed action plan for making amends and preventing future incidents, potentially including feedback from the affected party and addressing any systemic issues? Please provide a Ruby code that can handle these expanded requirements with the utmost care and sensitivity."
