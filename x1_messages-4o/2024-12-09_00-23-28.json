For example, if we use the code:\n\n```python\nb = [1,2,3]\nb+=(4,) # Prints out b = [1,2,3,4]\nb = b + (4,) # Gives an error saying you can't add tuples and lists\n```\nI expected `b+=(4,)` to fail as you can't add a list and a tuple, but it worked. However, when I tried `b = b + (4,)` expecting to get the same result, it didn't."

        "content": "This behavior can be explained by understanding how Python handles the `+=` operator and the `+` operator differently for lists.\n\n1. **Using `b += (4,)`:**\n\n   - The `+=` operator, when used with a list, doesn't strictly perform addition but rather an in-place modification. It invokes the `list.__iadd__` method, which is designed to extend the list with elements from the iterable on the right-hand side.\n   - When you do `b += (4,)`, Python internally converts the tuple `(4,)` into a list and then extends the list `b` with the elements of this newly created list.\n   - This is why `b += (4,)` works and results in `b` being `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.\n\n2. **Using `b = b + (4,)`:**\n\n   - The `+` operator, on the other hand, calls `list.__add__`. This method expects both operands to be lists, as it performs a concatenation operation.\n   - When you try `b = b + (4,)`, Python attempts to concatenate a list (`b`) and a tuple (`(4,)`), which leads to a TypeError because lists and tuples are different types and cannot be directly concatenated.\n   - To fix this and achieve the same result, you can convert the tuple to a list before using the `+` operator: `b = b + list((4,))`.\n\nIn summary, `+=` can extend a list with any iterable (including tuples) due to its in-place behavior, whereas `+` requires both operands to be of the same type for concatenation."
