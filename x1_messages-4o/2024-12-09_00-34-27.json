        "content": "In Spark 1.5, predicate pushdown for JDBC sources is somewhat limited. The expectation that a `LIMIT` clause would be pushed down to the database in the query isn't met in your case because Spark 1.5 doesn't support pushing down the `LIMIT` clause to JDBC data sources. Predicate pushdown typically involves filtering predicates like WHERE clauses, but not necessarily limits or aggregations.\n\nThe SQL logs you provided indicate that the entire dataset is initially retrieved and then filtered by Spark. This means that the limit operation is applied after the data is fetched from the database, not during the execution of the SQL query on the database side.\n\nTo achieve predicate pushdown, you should:\n\n1. Use filtering operations that can be pushed down, such as simple `WHERE` clauses.\n2. Upgrade to a newer version of Spark if possible, as newer versions have improved support for predicate pushdown, including more complex operations.\n3. Consider writing your SQL queries manually to include the desired clauses, such as `LIMIT`, before passing them to the JDBC source.\n\nIn your specific code snippet, if you want to ensure that only a limited number of rows are retrieved, you may need to modify the SQL query directly rather than relying on Spark's DataFrame operations alone:\n\n```python\nsql = \"(SELECT * FROM dummy LIMIT 1) AS some_alias\"\ndf = sqlContext.read.jdbc(url=url, table=sql)\ndf.show()\n```\n\nThis way, the limit clause is included directly in the SQL query, ensuring that only the specified number of rows are retrieved from the database."
