Assuming the list is stored in cells A2:A20, here's an example formula that you can use:\n=AVERAGE(LARGE(A2:A20,4):SMALL(A2:A20,18))\nMake sure to press Ctrl + Shift + Enter after entering the formula to turn it into an array formula. The formula works by using the LARGE function to retrieve the 4th largest value in the range and the SMALL function to retrieve the 18th smallest value in the range. It then takes the average of the remaining values between those two. \nHere is the Excel table:\n|   A   |\n---------\n|   10  |\n|   20  |\n|   30  |\n|   40  |\n|   50  |\n|   60  |\n|   70  |\n|   80  |\n|   90  |\n|   100 |\n|   110 |\n|   120 |\n|   130 |\n|   140 |\n|   150 |\n|   160 |\n|   170 |\n|   180 |\n|   190 |\n|   200 |"

        "content": "To calculate the average of a list of numbers while excluding the top 3 and bottom 3 values, you can use a combination of Excel functions, as you described. Here is a step-by-step explanation of how to do it:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide:\n\n1. **Identify the Range:**\n   - Your data is in cells A2:A20.\n\n2. **Exclude Top and Bottom Values:**\n   - Use the `LARGE` function to exclude the top 3 values. The fourth largest value in the range will be the starting point for your average.\n   - Use the `SMALL` function to exclude the bottom 3 values. The 18th smallest value in the range will be the endpoint for your average.\n\n3. **Array Formula:**\n   - Use an array formula that combines these functions to calculate the average of the values between the 4th largest and the 18th smallest.\n\n### Formula:\n\nYou can use this array formula:\n\n```excel\n=AVERAGE(IF(A2:A20<=LARGE(A2:A20,17), IF(A2:A20>=SMALL(A2:A20,4), A2:A20)))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`LARGE(A2:A20,17)`**: This identifies the value that is the 17th largest, effectively excluding the top 3 largest values (18th, 19th, 20th in terms of position).\n- **`SMALL(A2:A20,4)`**: This identifies the value that is the 4th smallest, effectively excluding the bottom 3 smallest values (1st, 2nd, 3rd in terms of position).\n- The `IF` statements together create a condition to include only those numbers in the range that are not among the top 3 or bottom 3.\n- `AVERAGE` then calculates the average of the numbers that meet these conditions.\n\n### Important:\n\n- Remember to press `Ctrl + Shift + Enter` after typing the formula to enter it as an array formula. Excel will show the formula enclosed in curly braces `{}` to indicate it is an array formula.\n\nThis formula will calculate the average of all the numbers in your list, excluding the top 3 and bottom 3 values."
