        "content": "To source a file like `/etc/default/foo` into your Python script and access variables defined within it, you can use Python to parse the file and extract the variable. Since the file contains a simple assignment, you can use Python's `configparser` or `os` module to achieve this. Here's a straightforward way to do it using the `os` module:\n\n1. Read the file.\n2. Extract the variable and its value.\n3. Use `os` to set the environment variable.\n\nHere's a step-by-step example:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef source_file(filepath):\n    variables = {}\n    with open(filepath, 'r') as file:\n        for line in file:\n            # Strip comments and whitespace\n            line = line.strip()\n            if line and not line.startswith('#'):\n                # Split the line into key and value\n                key, value = line.split('=', 1)\n                # Remove quotes from the value\n                value = value.strip().strip('\"').strip(\"'\")\n                variables[key] = value\n                # Set the environment variable\n                os.environ[key] = value\n    return variables\n\n# Filepath to your file\nfilepath = '/etc/default/foo'\n\n# Source the file\nvariables = source_file(filepath)\n\n# Access the variable\nfoo_value = os.environ.get('FOO')\nprint(f'FOO = {foo_value}')\n```\n\nThis script reads the file, extracts the `FOO` variable, and sets it as an environment variable using `os.environ`. You can then access it like any other environment variable in your script. This approach allows you to simulate sourcing a file like you would in a shell script."
