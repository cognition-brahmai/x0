        "content": "To find the current directory from where your Python script is running and the directory where your Python script is located, you can use the `os` and `__file__` modules in Python. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Current Working Directory**: This is the directory from which the Python script is being executed. You can find it using the `os.getcwd()` method.\n\n2. **Directory of the Python Script**: This is the directory where the script file is actually located. You can find it using the `os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))` method.\n\nHere's a sample code snippet demonstrating both:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Get the current working directory\ncurrent_working_directory = os.getcwd()\nprint(\"Current Working Directory:\", current_working_directory)\n\n# Get the directory where the script is located\nscript_directory = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))\nprint(\"Script Directory:\", script_directory)\n```\n\nMake sure to run this script from the terminal or command line to see the output, as some IDEs might change the current working directory to the directory of the script by default.\n\nPlease note that `__file__` might not be defined in certain interactive environments like some IDEs or notebooks, so it's best to run this code in a standalone script."
