To get an appropriate index for plotting and data analysis, I converted the varied 'rpm' values from a list into a pandas series (ser) and concatenated this series with the df. I extract the data I am interested in, which is the last line of each calculation, from the results_df using '.tail(1)'. I output the data to a .csv file, but the index and decimal sign options do not seem to be applied to the index column. The index column does not have three decimal digits and a comma as decimal sign as I expected. How could I achieve this behavior since the index option is set to True and all values (with exception to the index column) have the right format and decimal sign? Do I have to handle the index column separately?"

        "content": "When working with pandas DataFrames, the index column is often treated differently from the regular data columns. This is why your formatting options might not be applying to the index column as expected. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to handle the index column separately for formatting purposes:\n\n1. **Convert the Index to a Column**: Before exporting your DataFrame to a CSV file, you can convert the index to a regular column. This way, you can apply formatting to it just like any other column.\n\n2. **Apply Formatting**: Once the index is a column, you can format it to have three decimal places and a comma as the decimal separator.\n\n3. **Export to CSV**: After formatting, export your DataFrame to a CSV file. You can then choose whether or not to include the original index.\n\nHere's a sample code snippet to guide you through this process:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assume df is your summarizing dataframe\n\n# Convert RPM index to a column\ndf['rpm'] = df.index\n\n# Format the 'rpm' column to have three decimal places and a comma as the decimal separator\ndf['rpm'] = df['rpm'].apply(lambda x: f\"{x:,.3f}\".replace('.', ','))\n\n# Save to CSV without the original index, as 'rpm' is now a column\ndf.to_csv('output.csv', index=False, decimal=',')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Converting Index to Column**: The line `df['rpm'] = df.index` moves the index into a new column named 'rpm'.\n  \n- **Formatting**: The lambda function in `apply` formats each value in the 'rpm' column to three decimal places and replaces the period (decimal point) with a comma.\n\n- **Exporting to CSV**: The `index=False` parameter ensures that your newly formatted 'rpm' column is used instead of the original index.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that the 'rpm' values are formatted consistently with the rest of your data."
