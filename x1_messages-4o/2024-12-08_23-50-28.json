Here's how you can write the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Country\nFROM countries_population\nWHERE Population > 10000000;\n```\n\nIn this query:\n- We are selecting the `Country` column from a table named `countries_population`.\n- The `WHERE` clause filters the rows to include only those with a `Population` greater than 10 million.\n\nMake sure to replace `countries_population` with the actual name of your table if it's different. This query will return a list of countries that have populations exceeding 10 million."
