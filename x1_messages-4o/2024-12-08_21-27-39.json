        "content": "The length of a standard golf course can vary significantly, but typically, an 18-hole golf course ranges from about 6,500 to 7,000 yards (approximately 5,940 to 6,400 meters) in length. Championship courses, which are designed for professional tournaments, might be longer, sometimes exceeding 7,500 yards (about 6,860 meters). However, there are also shorter courses, such as executive courses, which are designed to be quicker to play and are generally much shorter in length."
