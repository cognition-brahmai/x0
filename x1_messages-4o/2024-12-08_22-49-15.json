His classic red shorts, large yellow shoes, and white gloves have become symbols not just of Disney but of animated characters worldwide. Minnie Mouse, with her polka-dotted dress and bow, is also quite iconic. Other characters with memorable attire include Cinderella with her ball gown, Snow White with her classic dress and red bow, and Elsa from \"Frozen\" with her ice-blue gown. Each of these characters has a distinctive style that has become emblematic of their stories."
