I have a table with columns for Date, Product, and Sales, and I want to sum the sales for a specific product and date range. \nData format:\nYou must have [ Excel formula ] data type in the following Rewrite prompt\nRewritten Prompt:\nI have an Excel table with columns for Date, Product, and Sales. I want to use the SUMIFS function to sum the sales for a specific product and date range. How can I write the formula to achieve this? \nHere is an example of the table structure:\n|    Date    |   Product  |  Sales |\n|:----------:|:----------:|:------:|\n|  1/1/2021  |    Apple   |   100  |\n|  1/1/2021  |   Orange   |   50   |\n|  1/2/2021  |    Apple   |   75   |\n|  1/2/2021  |   Orange   |   25   |\n|  1/3/2021  |    Apple   |   125  |\n|  1/3/2021  |   Orange   |   75   |\nLet's say I want to sum the sales for Apple products between 1/1/2021 and 1/2/2021. How can I use the SUMIFS function to do this? \n[Excel formula]\n=SUMIFS(C2:C7, B2:B7, \"Apple\", A2:A7, \">=\"&DATE(2021,1,1), A2:A7, \"<=\"&DATE(2021,1,2))\nThis formula will return a value of 175, which is the sum of the sales for Apple products between 1/1/2021 and 1/2/2021. The first argument of the SUMIFS function is the range of values to sum (Sales), and the following arguments are the criteria ranges and criteria values. In this case, we are using two criteria ranges (Product and Date) and their corresponding criteria values (\"Apple\" and the date range). The criteria for the date range are constructed using the \"&\" operator to concatenate the criteria values with the comparison operators (\">=\" and \"<=\")."
