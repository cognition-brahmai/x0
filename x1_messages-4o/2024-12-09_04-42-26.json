I understand that CUDA 5.5 should be compatible with g++ 4.7, and even g++ 4.8 according to /usr/local/cuda/include/host_config.h. However, when I try to compile a basic program, it fails with g++ 4.8 and returns an error indicating that \"__int128\" is undefined. The same program compiles and runs with g++ 4.7. But when I include <limits>, even g++ 4.7 fails. Is there a way to work around this issue? Can I expect a fix in the release of CUDA 5.5?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with CUDA SDK 5.5 RC and g++ 4.8 on MacOS X 10.8 is related to compatibility problems between the CUDA headers and certain GCC versions, particularly with the handling of `__int128`. CUDA 5.5 was designed to work with certain versions of the GCC compiler, and while it is stated to be compatible with g++ 4.7 and later, discrepancies like the one you're experiencing can arise, especially with newer GCC versions.\n\nHere are a few potential workarounds and considerations:\n\n1. **Stick with g++ 4.7:** Since you've noted that the program compiles and runs with g++ 4.7 (except when including `<limits>`), you might want to continue using this version for your current work. This isn't ideal if you want to use newer features from g++ 4.8, but it might be the most stable solution.\n\n2. **Modify CUDA Headers:** If you feel comfortable doing so, you can try modifying the CUDA header files to better handle the `__int128` type. This might involve conditionally defining `__int128` or altering the macros that guard this type's use. However, be cautious, as this could lead to other unforeseen issues.\n\n3. **Use a Workaround for `<limits>`:** If the inclusion of `<limits>` is causing the failure, consider whether you can avoid using this header or if there's a way to work around its necessity in your code. Sometimes, isolating and including only the specific parts of the standard library that you need can help avoid such compatibility issues.\n\n4. **Check for Updates:** Keep an eye on updates from NVIDIA regarding CUDA 5.5. While you're using a release candidate (RC), the final release might contain fixes for such compatibility issues. You can also look into patch notes or forums where similar issues might have been discussed by NVIDIA developers or the community.\n\n5. **Use a Different Compiler:** If you require features from g++ 4.8, consider using a different compiler that might offer better compatibility with CUDA 5.5. Clang, for instance, is another popular compiler on MacOS X and might not exhibit the same issues as g++.\n\n6. **Report the Issue:** If you haven't already, consider reporting this issue to NVIDIA. Providing them with detailed information about the bug could help them address it in future updates or releases.\n\nNavigating compiler and library compatibility issues can be tricky, so it may take some experimentation to find the most effective solution for your specific setup."
