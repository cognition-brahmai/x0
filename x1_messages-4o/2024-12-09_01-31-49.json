When I execute the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\nOrderedDict(a=1,b=2,c=3)\n```\n\nI end up with:\n\n```python\nOrderedDict([('a', 1), ('c', 3), ('b', 2)])\n```\n\nHowever, I expected the output to be:\n\n```python\nOrderedDict([('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)])\n```\n\nHow do I ensure that the `OrderedDict` is created in the correct order as I intended?"

        "content": "In Python, the `OrderedDict` is designed to maintain the order of elements as they are inserted. However, when you use keyword arguments (`a=1, b=2, c=3`) directly in the constructor of `OrderedDict`, the order may not be preserved because keyword arguments in a function call do not guarantee order prior to Python 3.6 and were officially ordered only from Python 3.7 onwards.\n\nTo ensure that the `OrderedDict` maintains the correct order, you can use a list of tuples to define the elements explicitly. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\n\nordered_dict = OrderedDict([('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)])\nprint(ordered_dict)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nOrderedDict([('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)])\n```\n\nUsing a list of tuples ensures that the order you specify is the order in which the elements will appear in the `OrderedDict`. This method works consistently across all versions of Python that support `OrderedDict`."
