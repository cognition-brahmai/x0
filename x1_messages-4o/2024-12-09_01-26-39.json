Python's slicing feature gracefully handles cases where the string is shorter than the specified slice length. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef get_first_100_characters(input_string):\n    return input_string[:100]\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_string = \"This is a sample string with less than 100 characters.\"\nresult = get_first_100_characters(my_string)\nprint(result)  # Outputs the entire string if it's less than 100 characters\n```\n\nThis method works by slicing the string from the beginning up to the 100th character. If the string has fewer than 100 characters, it simply returns the entire string without causing any errors."
