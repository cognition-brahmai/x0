Therefore, the statement is **false**.\n\n2. **The Eiffel Tower, a wrought-iron lattice tower, is located in the 7th arrondissement of Paris, France, and stands at a height of 324 meters.**\n\n   - The Eiffel Tower is indeed located in the 7th arrondissement of Paris.\n   - The height of the Eiffel Tower, including its antennas, is approximately 324 meters.\n   \n   Therefore, the statement is **true**."
