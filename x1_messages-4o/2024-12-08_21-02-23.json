Calculate the sum of the positive numbers and zero:  \n   \\(9 + 15 + 0 = 24\\).\n\n2. The absolute value of the negative number should be larger than the sum of the other three numbers. However, \\(-3\\) has an absolute value of 3, which is not larger than 24. Therefore, it is impossible to fulfill this condition with the given numbers.\n\nSince the condition can't be met with these numbers, we can only arrange them from least to greatest without considering that specific requirement:\n\n-3, 0, 9, 15"
