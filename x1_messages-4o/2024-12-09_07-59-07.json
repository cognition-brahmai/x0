However, I'm encountering an issue when there is more than one tab between each value. My current code is as follows:\n\n```python\nline = \"abc def ghi\"\nvalues = line.split(\"\\t\")\n```\n\nThis works fine when there is only one tab between each value. But if there is more than one tab, it copies the additional tabs to the 'values' list as well. This is often the case after the last value in the file. How can I modify my code to correctly handle multiple tabs?"

        "content": "To handle the situation where there are multiple tabs between values, you can use Python's `re` module to split the line using a regular expression that matches one or more tab characters (`\\t`). This will ensure that any number of consecutive tabs are treated as a single delimiter. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nline = \"abc\\t\\tdef\\t\\t\\tghi\"\n# Use a regular expression to split by one or more tabs\nvalues = re.split(r'\\t+', line)\nprint(values)\n```\n\nThis code will correctly split the line into `['abc', 'def', 'ghi']` regardless of how many tabs are between the values. The `re.split(r'\\t+', line)` function will treat any sequence of one or more tab characters as a single delimiter."
