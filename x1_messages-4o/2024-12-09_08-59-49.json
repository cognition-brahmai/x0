You would typically use it in conjunction with a `SELECT` statement. Here is a general example:\n\nSuppose you have a table named `your_table` with columns `column1`, `column2`, and `column3`. Here\u2019s how you could find the maximum value for each of these columns:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    MAX(column1) AS max_column1,\n    MAX(column2) AS max_column2,\n    MAX(column3) AS max_column3\nFROM \n    your_table;\n```\n\nThis query will return a single row with the maximum values for each specified column. If you have more columns, you can continue to add them in a similar fashion.\n\nRemember to replace `your_table`, `column1`, `column2`, and `column3` with the actual names of your table and columns."
