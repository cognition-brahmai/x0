When I run my code, it returns a DataError: No numeric types to aggregate.

        "content": "The error you're encountering typically arises because the `mean()` and `std()` functions require numeric types, and `timedelta` objects are not directly considered numeric. To calculate the mean and standard deviation of `timedelta` objects, you can convert them to a numeric representation such as total seconds. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. First, ensure that the `diff` column is of `timedelta64[ns]` type. If not, convert it.\n2. Convert the `timedelta` objects to a numeric representation, such as total seconds.\n3. Calculate the mean and standard deviation using this numeric representation.\n4. Optionally, convert the results back to `timedelta` for readability.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample data\ndata = {\n    'bank': ['Bank of Japan', 'Reserve Bank of Australia', 'Reserve Bank of New Zealand', 'U.S. Federal Reserve'],\n    'diff': ['0 days 00:00:57.416000', '0 days 00:00:21.452000', '55 days 12:39:32.269000', '8 days 13:27:11.387000']\n}\n\n# Create DataFrame\ndropped = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Convert 'diff' column to timedelta\ndropped['diff'] = pd.to_timedelta(dropped['diff'])\n\n# Convert 'diff' to total seconds for aggregation\ndropped['diff_seconds'] = dropped['diff'].dt.total_seconds()\n\n# Calculate mean and standard deviation of total seconds\nmeans_seconds = dropped.groupby('bank')['diff_seconds'].mean()\nstd_seconds = dropped.groupby('bank')['diff_seconds'].std()\n\n# Convert results back to timedelta for readability\nmeans_timedelta = pd.to_timedelta(means_seconds, unit='s')\nstd_timedelta = pd.to_timedelta(std_seconds, unit='s')\n\n# Display results\nprint(\"Means:\")\nprint(means_timedelta)\nprint(\"\\nStandard Deviations:\")\nprint(std_timedelta)\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that the `timedelta` objects are properly converted to a numeric format for aggregation, and then you can convert the results back to `timedelta` for a more interpretable output."
