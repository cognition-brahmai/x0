I'm encountering an error when I try to open more than 1024 files (the limit on my Linux machine as per 'ulimit -n') in a loop. The error message is \"OSError: [Errno 24] Too many open files: '/tmp/tmpc5W3CF'\". I'm confused about how to close each file, given that 'f' and 'path' returned by mkstemp() are just an 'int' and a 'str' respectively. Here is my code:\n\n```python\nfrom tempfile import mkstemp\n\nfor n in xrange(1024 + 1):\n    f, path = mkstemp()    \n```"

        "content": "When you use `tempfile.mkstemp()`, it returns a tuple consisting of a file descriptor (an integer) and a file path (a string). The file descriptor is what you need to close in order to free up resources. If you do not close these file descriptors, you will run into the \"Too many open files\" error because the operating system limits the number of file descriptors you can have open at once.\n\nTo fix this issue, you should close each file descriptor after you're done using it. You can do this using `os.close()`. Here's how you can modify your code to ensure the file descriptors are closed:\n\n```python\nfrom tempfile import mkstemp\nimport os\n\nfor n in range(1024 + 1):\n    f, path = mkstemp()\n    os.close(f)  # Close the file descriptor\n```\n\nIn this updated version of the code, `os.close(f)` is used to close each file descriptor immediately after it's opened, which will help you avoid hitting the file descriptor limit."
