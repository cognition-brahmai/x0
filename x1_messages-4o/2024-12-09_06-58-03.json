My program runs without issues on Ubuntu but fails on Windows. The error message suggests that I am attempting to start a new process before the current process has finished its bootstrapping phase and that I might have forgotten to use the `if __name__ == '__main__':` idiom in the main module. However, I am not launching my threads in the main module, but in a separate module inside a class. How can I fix this issue?\n\nHere is the error message:\n```\nRuntimeError: \nAttempt to start a new process before the current process\nhas finished its bootstrapping phase.\nThis probably means that you are on Windows and you have\nforgotten to use the proper idiom in the main module:\n    if __name__ == '__main__':\n        freeze_support()\n        ...\nThe \"freeze_support()\" line can be omitted if the program\nis not going to be frozen to produce a Windows executable.\n```\n\nAnd here is the code I am working with:\n\n`testMain.py`:\n```python\nimport parallelTestModule\n\nextractor = parallelTestModule.ParallelExtractor()\nextractor.runInParallel(numProcesses=2, numThreads=4)\n```\n\n`parallelTestModule.py`:\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\nfrom multiprocessing import Process\nimport threading\n\nclass ThreadRunner(threading.Thread):\n    \"\"\" This class represents a single instance of a running thread\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        threading.Thread.__init__(self)\n        self.name = name\n    def run(self):\n        print self.name,'\\n'\n\nclass ProcessRunner:\n    \"\"\" This class represents a single instance of a running process \"\"\"\n    def runp(self, pid, numThreads):\n        mythreads = []\n        for tid in range(numThreads):\n            name = \"Proc-\"+str(pid)+\"-Thread-\"+str(tid)\n            th = ThreadRunner(name)\n            mythreads.append(th) \n        for i in mythreads:\n            i.start()\n        for i in mythreads:\n            i.join()\n\nclass ParallelExtractor:    \n    def runInParallel(self, numProcesses, numThreads):\n        myprocs = []\n        prunner = ProcessRunner()\n        for pid in range(numProcesses):\n            pr = Process(target=prunner.runp, args=(pid, numThreads)) \n            myprocs.append(pr) \n        for i in myprocs:\n            i.start()\n\n        for i in myprocs:\n            i.join()\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to the way the multiprocessing module works on Windows. Unlike Unix-based systems like Linux and macOS, Windows does not support the `fork` method of creating new processes. Instead, it uses the `spawn` method, which requires the `if __name__ == '__main__':` idiom to be present in the script that is being run. This is because, on Windows, a new Python interpreter is spawned for each new process, and the entire script is re-imported. If the script doesn't have the `if __name__ == '__main__':` idiom, it can result in recursive spawning of processes leading to a `RuntimeError`.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to fix the issue:\n\n1. Ensure that the `if __name__ == '__main__':` idiom is used in your main script (`testMain.py`).\n2. Wrap the code that initiates the multiprocessing call within this block.\n\nHere's how your `testMain.py` should look:\n\n```python\nimport parallelTestModule\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    extractor = parallelTestModule.ParallelExtractor()\n    extractor.runInParallel(numProcesses=2, numThreads=4)\n```\n\nWith this change, the multiprocessing module can properly spawn new processes on Windows. The `if __name__ == '__main__':` statement ensures that the multiprocessing code is only executed when the script is run directly, and not when it is imported as a module in the new subprocess.\n\nThis should resolve the `RuntimeError` you are encountering on Windows."
