I currently check if the column or row exists before referencing it, as shown in the following code:\n\n```python\nif 'mycol' in df.columns and 'myindex' in df.index: \n    x = df.loc[myindex, mycol]\nelse: \n    x = mydefault\n```\nI'm looking for a more simplified solution, similar to how `x = getattr(anobject, 'id', default)` works on an arbitrary object. Is there anything similar to this in pandas?"

        "content": "Yes, there is a more concise way to achieve this in pandas using the `get` method for both columns and rows, or by leveraging `df.get` for an entire DataFrame when accessing a single value. Although pandas doesn't provide a direct method exactly like `getattr`, you can use the following approach to simplify your code:\n\n### Using `.get()` method:\n\nFor columns, you can use the `.get()` method of a Series, which works similarly to the dictionary `get` method. However, for rows, you'll need to access the DataFrame directly:\n\n```python\nx = df[mycol].get(myindex, mydefault) if mycol in df.columns else mydefault\n```\n\n### Using `.at[]` with try-except block:\n\nAlternatively, you can use `.at[]` for accessing a single value and handle exceptions if the index or column is not found:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    x = df.at[myindex, mycol]\nexcept (KeyError, IndexError):\n    x = mydefault\n```\n\n### Using `.loc[]` with `get` method:\n\nIf you prefer a more explicit way, you can use `.loc[]` with a double `get` pattern:\n\n```python\nx = df.loc[myindex].get(mycol, mydefault) if myindex in df.index else mydefault\n```\n\nEach of these methods provides a more streamlined way to handle missing columns or rows compared to your original approach. Choose the one that best fits your coding style and needs."
