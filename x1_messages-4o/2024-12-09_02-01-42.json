If you set `skiprows=1`, it will skip the first row of the file, as `skiprows` can accept an integer to skip that many lines starting from the top.\n\nHowever, if you specifically want to skip the second row (the row with index 1 in 0-indexing), you can pass a list to `skiprows` indicating the exact row indices you want to skip. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Specify the row indices to skip\ndf = pd.read_csv('your_file.csv', skiprows=[1])\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nIn this example, `skiprows=[1]` tells `pandas` to skip only the second row of the file. You can also include more indices in the list if you want to skip multiple specific rows."
