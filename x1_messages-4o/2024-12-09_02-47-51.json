        "content": "To call stored procedures in SQL Server using SQLAlchemy, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up SQLAlchemy**: Ensure you have SQLAlchemy installed, along with a suitable SQL Server database driver, such as `pyodbc` or `pymssql`.\n\n```bash\npip install sqlalchemy pyodbc\n```\n\n2. **Connect to the Database**: Establish a connection to your SQL Server database using SQLAlchemy's `create_engine` function.\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\n\n# Example connection string using pyodbc\nconnection_string = 'mssql+pyodbc://username:password@server/database?driver=ODBC+Driver+17+for+SQL+Server'\nengine = create_engine(connection_string)\n```\n\n3. **Call the Stored Procedure**: Use a SQLAlchemy connection to execute the stored procedure. You'll typically use the `execute` method.\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy.sql import text\n\n# Define the stored procedure call\nstored_procedure = \"EXEC my_stored_procedure @param1=:param1, @param2=:param2\"\n\n# Connect to the database\nwith engine.connect() as connection:\n    # Execute the stored procedure\n    result = connection.execute(text(stored_procedure), param1=value1, param2=value2)\n\n    # Fetch results if the procedure returns any\n    rows = result.fetchall()\n    for row in rows:\n        print(row)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Parameters**: If your stored procedure requires parameters, pass them using the `text` function from SQLAlchemy, and bind parameters as shown.\n\n- **Fetching Results**: Use `fetchall()`, `fetchone()`, or other SQLAlchemy result methods to retrieve data returned by the stored procedure.\n\n- **Error Handling**: Consider using try-except blocks to handle any exceptions that might occur during the execution.\n\n- **Connection Management**: It's a good practice to use context managers (`with` statements) to ensure connections are properly managed and closed after use.\n\nThis approach should help you effectively call stored procedures in SQL Server using SQLAlchemy. Adjust the connection string and procedure call as needed for your specific database and procedure requirements."
