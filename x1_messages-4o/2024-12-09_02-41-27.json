Here is the code snippet:\n\n```python\nclass TrivialClass:\n    def __init__(self, str_arg: str):\n        self.string_attribute = str_arg\n\n    @classmethod\n    def from_int(cls, int_arg: int) -> ?:\n        str_arg = str(int_arg)\n        return cls(str_arg)\n```\n\nI am trying to annotate the return type of the `from_int` method. I have tried using both `cls` and `TrivialClass` as the return type, but PyCharm flags them as unresolved references. Is there a way to annotate the return type when the returned value is an instance of `cls`?"

        "content": "In Python, when you want to annotate the return type of a class method that returns an instance of the class itself, you can use the `-> TrivialClass` annotation, and it should work correctly. However, if you're encountering issues with PyCharm or other tools, you can also use the `Type[T]` and `TypeVar` from the `typing` module to achieve this in a more flexible way.\n\nHere's how you can annotate the `from_int` method using `TypeVar` and `Type`:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Type, TypeVar\n\nT = TypeVar('T', bound='TrivialClass')\n\nclass TrivialClass:\n    def __init__(self, str_arg: str):\n        self.string_attribute = str_arg\n\n    @classmethod\n    def from_int(cls: Type[T], int_arg: int) -> T:\n        str_arg = str(int_arg)\n        return cls(str_arg)\n```\n\nIn this setup:\n\n- `T` is a `TypeVar` that represents a type bound to `TrivialClass`.\n- `cls: Type[T]` indicates that `cls` is expected to be a type or a subclass of `TrivialClass`.\n- `-> T` specifies that the method's return type will be an instance of `TrivialClass` or its subclass.\n\nThis approach is more robust, especially in scenarios involving inheritance, where subclasses of `TrivialClass` might use this method."
