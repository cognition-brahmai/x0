        "content": "Certainly! Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the list is sorted.\n\nHere's a C program that demonstrates how to implement bubble sort to sort an array:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n// Function to perform bubble sort on an array\nvoid bubbleSort(int arr[], int n) {\n    int i, j;\n    for (i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {\n        // Last i elements are already in place\n        for (j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++) {\n            if (arr[j] > arr[j+1]) {\n                // Swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]\n                int temp = arr[j];\n                arr[j] = arr[j+1];\n                arr[j+1] = temp;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to print an array\nvoid printArray(int arr[], int n) {\n    int i;\n    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)\n        printf(\"%d \", arr[i]);\n    printf(\"\\n\");\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int arr[] = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90};\n    int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);\n    printf(\"Original array: \\n\");\n    printArray(arr, n);\n\n    bubbleSort(arr, n);\n\n    printf(\"Sorted array: \\n\");\n    printArray(arr, n);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Function `bubbleSort`:** \n   - The outer loop runs `n-1` times, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.\n   - The inner loop compares each pair of adjacent elements. If a pair is in the wrong order, it swaps them.\n   - After each pass of the outer loop, the largest unsorted element gets placed at the end of the array.\n\n2. **Function `printArray`:**\n   - This function simply prints the elements of the array.\n\n3. **`main` Function:**\n   - An example array is defined and its size is calculated.\n   - The original array is printed, then sorted using the `bubbleSort` function, and finally, the sorted array is printed.\n\nThis program should give you a straightforward implementation of the bubble sort algorithm in C. You can modify the array and try sorting different sets of numbers to see how it works."
