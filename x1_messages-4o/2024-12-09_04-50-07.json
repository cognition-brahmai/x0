The matrix was derived from a Pandas dataframe with feature names for the columns. When I try to see the feature importance using the `xgboost.plot_importance()` function, the resulting plot does not display the feature names. Instead, the features are listed as `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, etc. Could this be due to the conversion of my original Pandas dataframe into a DMatrix? How can I properly associate the feature names so they appear in the feature importance plot?\n\n```python\nXtrain, Xval, ytrain, yval = train_test_split(df[feature_names], y, \\\n                                    test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\ndtrain = xgb.DMatrix(Xtrain, label=ytrain)\n\nmodel = xgb.train(xgb_params, dtrain, num_boost_round=60, \\\n                  early_stopping_rounds=50, maximize=False, verbose_eval=10)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(10,10))\nxgb.plot_importance(model, max_num_features=5, ax=ax)\n```"

        "content": "When using `xgboost.DMatrix` for training, the feature names from your original Pandas DataFrame can sometimes be lost if they are not explicitly passed during the creation of the DMatrix. To ensure that the feature names are retained and appear in your feature importance plot, you should provide them when creating the DMatrix. \n\nHere is how you can ensure the feature names are preserved:\n\n1. When you create the `DMatrix`, pass the `feature_names` parameter explicitly.\n\nHere's an updated version of your code to ensure feature names are retained:\n\n```python\n# Splitting the data\nXtrain, Xval, ytrain, yval = train_test_split(df[feature_names], y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Create DMatrix with feature names\ndtrain = xgb.DMatrix(Xtrain, label=ytrain, feature_names=feature_names)\n\n# Train the model\nmodel = xgb.train(xgb_params, dtrain, num_boost_round=60, early_stopping_rounds=50, maximize=False, verbose_eval=10)\n\n# Plot feature importance\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(10, 10))\nxgb.plot_importance(model, max_num_features=5, ax=ax)\n```\n\nBy passing `feature_names=feature_names` when creating the `DMatrix`, you ensure that the feature names from your DataFrame are accurately associated with the features in your model. This should correctly display the feature names in the feature importance plot."
