I want to use this for header code that will be shared between nvcc and VC++ compilers. I am aware I can create my own and pass it as an argument to the nvcc compiler (-D), but I am looking for an existing one."

        "content": "Yes, the CUDA compiler `nvcc` provides several predefined macros that you can use to distinguish when your code is being compiled with `nvcc`. Here are some of the commonly used predefined macros:\n\n1. **`__CUDACC__`**: This macro is defined when the code is being compiled with the NVIDIA CUDA Compiler (`nvcc`). You can use it to conditionally compile code specifically for CUDA.\n\n   ```cpp\n   #ifdef __CUDACC__\n   // CUDA-specific code\n   #else\n   // Non-CUDA code\n   #endif\n   ```\n\n2. **`__CUDA_ARCH__`**: This macro is defined when compiling device code and it represents the compute capability of the GPU architecture. It is useful for writing code that depends on the specific GPU architecture.\n\n3. **`__NVCC__`**: This macro can also be used to detect when the code is being compiled with `nvcc`.\n\nUsing these macros, you can conditionally include or exclude code sections when compiling with `nvcc` or other compilers like MSVC:\n\n```cpp\n#ifdef __CUDACC__\n// Code specific for CUDA compilation\n#else\n// Code for non-CUDA compilation (e.g., MSVC)\n#endif\n```\n\nBy using these predefined macros, you can manage code that needs to be shared across different compilers while taking advantage of CUDA-specific features when compiling with `nvcc`."
