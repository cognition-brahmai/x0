I am aware of the `scipy.misc.imresize` function which does this by wrapping PIL's resize function. However, it uses PIL and the numpy array has to conform to image formats, which gives me a maximum of 4 \"color\" channels. Is there a way to resize arbitrary images, with any number of \"color\" channels in scipy/numpy, or do I have to create my own function for this? I have thought of running `scipy.misc.imresize` on every channel separately or creating my own using `scipy.ndimage.interpolation.affine_transform`. The first idea seems slow for large data and the second one appears to offer only splines as the interpolation method."

        "content": "To resample a NumPy array representing image data at a new size with a choice of interpolation methods, you can use the `scipy.ndimage` module, specifically the `scipy.ndimage.zoom` function, which allows you to specify the order of the spline interpolation. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using `scipy.ndimage.zoom`:**\n\n   The `zoom` function can handle arrays with an arbitrary number of dimensions, so you can use it to resize images with any number of channels. The `order` parameter specifies the type of interpolation:\n\n   - `order=0` for nearest-neighbor interpolation\n   - `order=1` for bilinear interpolation\n   - `order=3` for cubic interpolation (default)\n\n   Here's an example:\n\n   ```python\n   import numpy as np\n   from scipy.ndimage import zoom\n\n   def resample_array(arr, new_size, order=1):\n       factors = [n / float(o) for n, o in zip(new_size, arr.shape)]\n       return zoom(arr, zoom=factors, order=order)\n\n   # Example usage\n   original_array = np.random.rand(100, 100, 5)  # Random array with 5 channels\n   new_size = (200, 200, 5)  # New size\n   resized_array = resample_array(original_array, new_size, order=1)\n   ```\n\n2. **Using OpenCV (optional):**\n\n   Another option is to use OpenCV, which supports various interpolation methods and can handle images with multiple channels. OpenCV's `resize` function is efficient and easy to use:\n\n   ```python\n   import cv2\n\n   def resize_with_opencv(arr, new_size, interpolation=cv2.INTER_LINEAR):\n       # OpenCV expects image data in the form (height, width, channels)\n       return cv2.resize(arr, (new_size[1], new_size[0]), interpolation=interpolation)\n\n   # Example usage\n   original_array = np.random.rand(100, 100, 5).astype(np.float32)  # Random array with 5 channels\n   new_size = (200, 200)  # New size without channels\n   resized_array = resize_with_opencv(original_array, new_size, interpolation=cv2.INTER_LINEAR)\n   ```\n\n3. **Considerations for Large Data:**\n\n   - If performance is a concern and you're working with large datasets, you might want to profile the time taken by these methods.\n   - OpenCV is generally faster and can be a better choice if you frequently perform resizing operations.\n\nChoose the method that best fits your requirements, considering both performance and the specific interpolation needs of your application."
