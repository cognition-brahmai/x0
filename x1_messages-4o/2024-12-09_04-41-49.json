Here is my current code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport fileinput\n\nprint (\"Text to search for:\")\ntextToSearch = input( \"> \" )\n\nprint (\"Text to replace it with:\")\ntextToReplace = input( \"> \" )\n\nprint (\"File to perform Search-Replace on:\")\nfileToSearch  = input( \"> \" )\n\ntempFile = open( fileToSearch, 'r+' )\n\nfor line in fileinput.input( fileToSearch ):\n    if textToSearch in line :\n        print('Match Found')\n    else:\n        print('Match Not Found!!')\n    tempFile.write( line.replace( textToSearch, textToReplace ) )\ntempFile.close()\n\ninput( '\\n\\n Press Enter to exit...' )\n```\n\nThe input file is as follows:\n\n```\nhi this is abcd hi this is abcd\nThis is dummy text file.\nThis is how search and replace works abcd\n```\n\nThe code works when I search and replace 'ram' by 'abcd' in the above input file. However, when I try to replace 'abcd' by 'ram', some junk characters are left at the end. For example:\n\n```\nhi this is ram hi this is ram\nThis is dummy text file.\nThis is how search and replace works rambcd\n```\n\nHow can I fix this problem?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the way you're writing to the file. When you open the file in `'r+'` mode and write to it, you might end up with leftover data if the replacement text is shorter than the original text. This happens because the file is not being truncated after writing.\n\nTo fix this, you should read the file content, perform the replacements, and then rewrite the file with the modified content. Here's an updated version of your code that addresses this issue:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Text to search for:\")\ntextToSearch = input(\"> \")\n\nprint(\"Text to replace it with:\")\ntextToReplace = input(\"> \")\n\nprint(\"File to perform Search-Replace on:\")\nfileToSearch = input(\"> \")\n\n# Read the file contents\nwith open(fileToSearch, 'r') as file:\n    fileContents = file.readlines()\n\n# Replace the text in each line\nnewContents = []\nfor line in fileContents:\n    newLine = line.replace(textToSearch, textToReplace)\n    newContents.append(newLine)\n    if textToSearch in line:\n        print('Match Found')\n    else:\n        print('Match Not Found!!')\n\n# Write the modified contents back to the file\nwith open(fileToSearch, 'w') as file:\n    file.writelines(newContents)\n\ninput('\\n\\nPress Enter to exit...')\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the changes:\n\n1. **Reading the File**: Open the file in read mode and store all lines in a list (`fileContents`). This allows you to work with the text without interfering with the file pointer positions.\n\n2. **Replacing Text**: Perform the search and replace on each line and store it in a new list (`newContents`).\n\n3. **Writing Back**: Open the file in write mode (`'w'`) and write the modified contents back to the file. This ensures that any extra characters are removed because writing in `'w'` mode truncates the file before writing.\n\nBy reading the entire file content first and then writing the entire modified content back, you avoid issues with leftover characters."
