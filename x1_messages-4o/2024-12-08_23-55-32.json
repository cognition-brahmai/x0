        "content": "Certainly! Let's break this down into three parts: creating the JSON data format, implementing a response validation system, and randomizing the order of questions.\n\n### 1. JSON Data Format for a Survey\n\nHere's a basic JSON structure for a survey with five open-ended questions about 3D printing:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"surveyTitle\": \"3D Printing Survey\",\n  \"questions\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"question\": \"What do you think are the most important applications of 3D printing?\",\n      \"type\": \"open-ended\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": 2,\n      \"question\": \"How do you foresee the evolution of 3D printing technology in the next decade?\",\n      \"type\": \"open-ended\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": 3,\n      \"question\": \"What are the biggest challenges facing 3D printing today?\",\n      \"type\": \"open-ended\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": 4,\n      \"question\": \"In what industries do you think 3D printing will have the most impact?\",\n      \"type\": \"open-ended\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": 5,\n      \"question\": \"How has 3D printing affected your personal or professional life?\",\n      \"type\": \"open-ended\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Implementing a Response Validation System\n\nFor open-ended questions, validation can be minimal but should ensure that responses are not empty. You can implement the following basic checks:\n\n- **Non-empty Response**: Ensure that the participant provides some input.\n- **Length Check**: Optionally, set a minimum and maximum character limit.\n- **Profanity Check**: Use a library or API to filter out inappropriate language.\n\nHere's a pseudo-code example of how you might implement this:\n\n```python\ndef validate_response(response, min_length=10, max_length=500):\n    if not response:\n        return False, \"Response cannot be empty.\"\n    if len(response) < min_length:\n        return False, f\"Response must be at least {min_length} characters long.\"\n    if len(response) > max_length:\n        return False, f\"Response must be no more than {max_length} characters long.\"\n    if contains_profanity(response):\n        return False, \"Response contains inappropriate language.\"\n    return True, \"Valid response.\"\n\ndef contains_profanity(text):\n    # Implement a simple profanity check\n    # This can be replaced with a more complex library or API call\n    profanity_list = [\"badword1\", \"badword2\"]\n    return any(profanity in text for profanity in profanity_list)\n```\n\n### 3. Randomizing the Order of Questions\n\nTo randomize the order of questions while ensuring each is only asked once, you can shuffle the list of questions. Here\u2019s how you can do it in Python:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef randomize_questions(questions):\n    random.shuffle(questions)\n    return questions\n\n# Assuming 'questions' is a list of question dictionaries\nquestions = [\n    {\"id\": 1, \"question\": \"What do you think are the most important applications of 3D printing?\"},\n    {\"id\": 2, \"question\": \"How do you foresee the evolution of 3D printing technology in the next decade?\"},\n    {\"id\": 3, \"question\": \"What are the biggest challenges facing 3D printing today?\"},\n    {\"id\": 4, \"question\": \"In what industries do you think 3D printing will have the most impact?\"},\n    {\"id\": 5, \"question\": \"How has 3D printing affected your personal or professional life?\"}\n]\n\nrandomized_questions = randomize_questions(questions)\n```\n\nThis code will shuffle the questions list in-place, randomizing the order in which they\u2019re presented.\n\nBy combining these techniques, you can create a flexible and dynamic survey experience for participants."
