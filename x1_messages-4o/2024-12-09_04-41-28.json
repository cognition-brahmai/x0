However, I am under the impression that strongly typed languages don't allow changing the type of a variable at run-time. For instance, in Python, we can assign a value of type integer to a variable and then change it to a string, as shown below:\n\n```python\nbob = 1\nbob = \"bob\"\n```\n\nGiven this, I am questioning whether Python is a strongly typed language or not. Can someone clarify this?"

        "content": "Certainly! The concept of strong vs. weak typing can sometimes be confusing because the definitions can vary depending on context and interpretation. However, let me clarify how Python fits into this.\n\n1. **Strong Typing**: A language is considered strongly typed if it enforces type rules strictly. This means that you cannot perform operations on incompatible types without explicit conversion. Python is strongly typed in this sense because it does not allow implicit conversions between types that could lead to unpredictable behavior. For example, you cannot concatenate a string and an integer directly without converting the integer to a string first.\n\n   ```python\n   x = \"Hello\" + 5  # This will raise a TypeError\n   ```\n\n2. **Dynamic Typing**: Python is dynamically typed, meaning that the type of a variable is determined at runtime. You can reassign variables to different types, as you demonstrated with the `bob` variable. This flexibility does not contradict strong typing; rather, it complements it by allowing the type of a variable to change over time.\n\nIn summary, Python is both strongly typed and dynamically typed. It enforces type rules strictly (strong typing) while allowing the types of variables to change at runtime (dynamic typing). This combination gives Python its flexibility and power while maintaining type safety."
