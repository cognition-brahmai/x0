Below is a simple Dockerfile example that sets up a basic Python application:\n\n```Dockerfile\n# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image\nFROM python:3.9-slim\n\n# Set the working directory in the container\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app\nADD . /app\n\n# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\n\n# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container\nEXPOSE 80\n\n# Define environment variable\nENV NAME World\n\n# Run app.py when the container launches\nCMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"]\n```\n\nFor more information and to explore Docker further, you can visit the [Docker GitHub repository](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce)."
