Can you write an SQL query that involves multiple-step reasoning to calculate the total number of orders placed in the dataset and the total revenue generated from those orders?

Let's assume your dataset table is named `orders`, and it has columns `order_id`, `customer_name`, `order_date`, and `total_amount`.\n\nHere is the [SQL query]:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders,\n    SUM(total_amount) AS total_revenue\nFROM \n    orders;\n```\n\nThis query performs the following steps:\n\n1. `COUNT(order_id)`: Counts the total number of orders by counting the number of `order_id` entries in the `orders` table.\n2. `SUM(total_amount)`: Calculates the total revenue by summing up all the `total_amount` values from the `orders` table.\n\nThe result will give you the total number of orders and the total revenue generated from those orders."
