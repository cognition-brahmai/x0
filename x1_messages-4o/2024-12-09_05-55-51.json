        "content": "I am working on managing a large workflow of ETL tasks where the execution depends on various factors such as time, data availability, or an external event. During the execution of the workflow, some jobs might fail and I want the system to restart a failed workflow branch without waiting for the whole workflow to finish execution. Are there any Python frameworks that can handle this? The core functionalities I am looking for include DAG building, execution of nodes with features such as running shell commands with wait and logging, the ability to rebuild a sub-graph in parent DAG during execution, ability to manually execute nodes or sub-graph while the parent graph is running, suspending graph execution while waiting for an external event, and listing job queue and job details. I need something similar to Apache Oozie but more general purpose and in Python."

        "content": "To manage complex ETL workflows in Python with features similar to Apache Oozie, you have several options that offer robust workflow management and scheduling capabilities. Here are a few frameworks that might meet your needs:\n\n1. **Apache Airflow**:\n   - **DAG Building**: Apache Airflow allows you to define workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), with tasks represented as nodes.\n   - **Task Execution**: Supports running shell commands, Python functions, and more with extensive logging and monitoring.\n   - **Dynamic Workflows**: You can modify DAGs dynamically and restart specific tasks or branches upon failure.\n   - **Manual Execution**: You can manually trigger tasks or DAGs through the Airflow UI.\n   - **External Event Handling**: Airflow has built-in sensors to pause execution until specific conditions are met, such as data availability or external events.\n   - **Job Queue and Details**: Provides a rich UI for monitoring DAG execution, task states, and logs.\n\n2. **Luigi**:\n   - **Task Dependency**: Define tasks and their dependencies programmatically.\n   - **Task Execution**: Supports shell commands and Python function execution with built-in logging.\n   - **Failure Handling**: Luigi can rerun specific tasks upon failure.\n   - **Manual Execution**: Allows for command-line execution of specific tasks.\n   - **External Events**: Custom task implementations can block until an external event occurs.\n\n3. **Prefect**:\n   - **Dynamic Workflows**: Prefect offers dynamic, Pythonic workflows with the ability to modify task behavior at runtime.\n   - **Task Execution**: Supports running shell commands, Python code, and more with detailed logging.\n   - **Restart Capabilities**: Prefect can restart failed tasks or branches without rerunning the entire workflow.\n   - **Manual and Interactive Execution**: Prefect Cloud or Prefect Server provides interfaces for manual task triggering.\n   - **Event Handling**: You can implement custom logic to pause tasks waiting for external conditions.\n\n4. **Dagster**:\n   - **DAG and Node Management**: Dagster provides a powerful model for representing, executing, and monitoring data pipelines.\n   - **Execution Control**: Supports executing tasks with shell commands, Python code, and more.\n   - **Event-Based Execution**: Dagster allows for waiting on external events with sensors and schedules.\n   - **Manual Execution**: Provides a UI for manually triggering tasks and monitoring execution.\n\nEach of these frameworks has its strengths and trade-offs, so you might want to evaluate them based on your specific requirements, such as ease of integration, scalability, and user interface preferences. Apache Airflow is particularly popular for its extensive community support and feature set, but Prefect and Dagster are also gaining traction for their modern approach to workflow management."
