I want to extract the bucket_name into one variable and the rest of the path into another variable. I was able to use regular expressions to extract the bucket_name like this: \n\n```python\nm = re.search('(?<=s3:\\/\\/)[^\\/]+', 's3://bucket_name/folder1/folder2/file1.json')\nprint(m.group(0))\n```\n\nHowever, I'm unsure how to extract the rest of the path, i.e. `folder1/folder2/file1.json`. Is there a way to do this using regular expressions or another method, possibly with boto3? I've checked for boto3 features to extract the bucket_name and key from the URL, but couldn't find any."

        "content": "You can extract the bucket name and the rest of the path from an S3 URL using regular expressions, as you've already done for the bucket name. To extract the rest of the path, you can use another regular expression or use string manipulation techniques. Here\u2019s an approach using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ns3_url = 's3://bucket_name/folder1/folder2/file1.json'\n\n# Extract the bucket name\nbucket_match = re.search(r'(?<=s3:\\/\\/)[^\\/]+', s3_url)\nbucket_name = bucket_match.group(0) if bucket_match else None\n\n# Extract the rest of the path\npath_match = re.search(r'(?<=s3:\\/\\/[^\\/]+\\/).+', s3_url)\npath = path_match.group(0) if path_match else None\n\nprint(\"Bucket Name:\", bucket_name)\nprint(\"Path:\", path)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- The first regex pattern `(?<=s3:\\/\\/)[^\\/]+` extracts the bucket name as you've already implemented.\n- The second regex pattern `(?<=s3:\\/\\/[^\\/]+\\/).+` extracts the rest of the path by looking for characters following the `s3://bucket_name/`.\n\nIf you prefer not to use regular expressions, you can also achieve this using Python's string manipulation methods:\n\n```python\ns3_url = 's3://bucket_name/folder1/folder2/file1.json'\n\n# Remove the 's3://' prefix\nstripped_url = s3_url[5:]\n\n# Split the string into bucket name and path\nbucket_name, path = stripped_url.split('/', 1)\n\nprint(\"Bucket Name:\", bucket_name)\nprint(\"Path:\", path)\n```\n\nThis approach uses simple string slicing and splitting to achieve the same result. Both methods will give you the bucket name and the path separately."
