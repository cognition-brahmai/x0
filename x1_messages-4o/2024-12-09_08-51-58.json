        "content": "Certainly! To create a tree structure from a list of tuples using Python, you can use a class that represents each node of the tree and a function to build the tree from the given list of tuples. Each tuple should contain a parent-child relationship. Here is an example implementation:\n\n```python\nclass TreeNode:\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.value = value\n        self.children = []\n\n    def add_child(self, child_node):\n        self.children.append(child_node)\n\n    def __repr__(self, level=0):\n        ret = \"\\t\" * level + repr(self.value) + \"\\n\"\n        for child in self.children:\n            ret += child.__repr__(level + 1)\n        return ret\n\ndef build_tree(pairs):\n    nodes = {}\n    \n    # Create all nodes\n    for parent, child in pairs:\n        if parent not in nodes:\n            nodes[parent] = TreeNode(parent)\n        if child not in nodes:\n            nodes[child] = TreeNode(child)\n\n    # Add child nodes to respective parent nodes\n    for parent, child in pairs:\n        nodes[parent].add_child(nodes[child])\n\n    # Identify the root node(s) (nodes that are never children)\n    children = {child for _, child in pairs}\n    roots = [node for node in nodes.values() if node.value not in children]\n\n    return roots\n\n# Example usage\npairs = [\n    ('A', 'B'),\n    ('A', 'C'),\n    ('B', 'D'),\n    ('B', 'E'),\n    ('C', 'F'),\n    ('C', 'G')\n]\n\ntree_roots = build_tree(pairs)\nfor root in tree_roots:\n    print(root)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `TreeNode`: This class represents each node in the tree. It has a `value` and a list of `children`.\n- `add_child`: Method to add a child node to the current node.\n- `__repr__`: A method to provide a string representation of the tree for easy visualization.\n- `build_tree`: This function takes a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a parent-child relationship, and constructs the tree.\n\n### Usage:\n- Define the list of tuples, where each tuple represents a `(parent, child)` relationship.\n- Call `build_tree` with this list to get the root node(s) of the tree.\n- Print the tree to visualize its structure.\n\nThis code will help you create and visualize a tree structure from a given list of parent-child relationships."
