The criteria for matching movies can also be expanded to include movies that have won nominations in international film festivals and feature lesser-known actors who have delivered stellar performances. Additionally, the code should be able to handle a larger dataset of movies, and the search algorithm should be optimized to provide results based on the user's preference of attributes."

        "content": "To modify the existing C++ code to handle multiple vectors of movie objects with additional attributes, we need to expand the `Movie` class and update the search algorithm. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:\n\nFirst, update the `Movie` class to include additional attributes such as `releaseYear`, `director`, `genre`, `hasWonNominations`, and `hasLesserKnownActors`.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n#include <vector>\n#include <algorithm>\n\nclass Movie {\npublic:\n    std::string title;\n    int releaseYear;\n    std::string director;\n    std::string genre;\n    bool hasWonNominations;\n    bool hasLesserKnownActors;\n\n    Movie(std::string t, int y, std::string d, std::string g, bool won, bool lesser)\n        : title(t), releaseYear(y), director(d), genre(g), hasWonNominations(won), hasLesserKnownActors(lesser) {}\n};\n\n// Function to search for movies based on user preferences\nstd::vector<Movie> searchMovies(const std::vector<Movie>& movies, const std::string& preferredGenre, bool requireNominations, bool requireLesserKnownActors) {\n    std::vector<Movie> results;\n    \n    for (const Movie& movie : movies) {\n        if ((preferredGenre.empty() || movie.genre == preferredGenre) &&\n            (!requireNominations || movie.hasWonNominations) &&\n            (!requireLesserKnownActors || movie.hasLesserKnownActors)) {\n            results.push_back(movie);\n        }\n    }\n\n    return results;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::vector<Movie> movies = {\n        Movie(\"Movie A\", 2022, \"Director A\", \"Action\", true, false),\n        Movie(\"Movie B\", 2021, \"Director B\", \"Drama\", false, true),\n        Movie(\"Movie C\", 2020, \"Director C\", \"Comedy\", true, true),\n        // Add more movies as needed\n    };\n\n    std::string preferredGenre = \"Comedy\";\n    bool requireNominations = true;\n    bool requireLesserKnownActors = true;\n\n    std::vector<Movie> results = searchMovies(movies, preferredGenre, requireNominations, requireLesserKnownActors);\n\n    std::cout << \"Search Results:\" << std::endl;\n    for (const Movie& movie : results) {\n        std::cout << movie.title << \" (\" << movie.releaseYear << \"), Directed by \" << movie.director << \", Genre: \" << movie.genre << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Key Modifications and Features:\n1. **Expanded Movie Class**: Additional attributes like `releaseYear`, `director`, `genre`, `hasWonNominations`, and `hasLesserKnownActors` are added to the `Movie` class.\n\n2. **Search Function**: A `searchMovies` function is added to filter movies based on user preferences for genre, nominations, and lesser-known actors. This function iterates through the movie list and applies the filtering criteria.\n\n3. **Optimized Search**: The search uses simple filtering logic. For larger datasets, consider using more sophisticated data structures (e.g., hash maps, sets) to improve search efficiency based on your specific requirements.\n\n4. **User Preferences**: The search function allows the user to specify preferences for genre, whether the movie needs to have won nominations, and whether it features lesser-known actors. The function returns movies that match these criteria.\n\nThis code can be expanded further based on additional requirements such as more complex search preferences, handling exceptions, or integrating with a database for very large datasets."
