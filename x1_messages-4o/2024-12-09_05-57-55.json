I already know how to do this using a non-recursive way, but I am not sure how to implement it recursively. Here is the non-recursive implementation I have done:\n\n```python\ndef listSum(ls):\n    i = 0\n    s = 0\n    while i < len(ls):\n        s = s + ls[i]\n        i = i + 1\n    print(s)\n```\nBut I need the basic way to do this since special built-in functions are not allowed."

        "content": "To write a recursive function to sum a list of integers, you need to think about the problem in terms of a base case and a recursive case. The base case is the simplest instance of the problem, which can be solved directly. The recursive case is where the function calls itself with a smaller instance of the problem until it reaches the base case.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation and implementation of the `listSum` function using recursion:\n\n1. **Base Case**: If the list is empty, the sum is 0.\n2. **Recursive Case**: Otherwise, take the first element of the list, and add it to the sum of the rest of the list.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef listSum(ls):\n    # Base case: if the list is empty, return 0\n    if not ls:\n        return 0\n    # Recursive case: first element + sum of the rest of the list\n    else:\n        return ls[0] + listSum(ls[1:])\n\n# Example usage\nprint(listSum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: 15\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Base Case**: `if not ls: return 0` checks if the list is empty (`ls` is `False` when it's empty). If it is, the function returns 0.\n- **Recursive Case**: `return ls[0] + listSum(ls[1:])` takes the first element of the list (`ls[0]`) and adds it to the result of the recursive call on the rest of the list (`ls[1:]`).\n\nThis function will keep calling itself with a smaller list until it reaches an empty list, at which point it will start returning the sums back up the call stack, resulting in the total sum of the list."
