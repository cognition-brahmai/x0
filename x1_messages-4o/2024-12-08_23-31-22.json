        "content": "To analyze the impact of solar energy on the environment, economy, and society using C#, we need to extend the existing code to include additional calculations and data relevant to these areas. The code should be modular to handle different aspects of the analysis, including environmental benefits, economic impacts, and societal factors. Here's a conceptual framework and a sample code structure to guide you through this process:\n\n### 1. Environmental Impact Analysis\nThe environmental impact of solar energy involves calculating the reduction in carbon emissions and other pollutants when switching from fossil fuels to solar power.\n\n### 2. Economic Impact Analysis\nThe economic impact includes cost savings, return on investment, job creation, and local economic benefits due to solar energy installations.\n\n### 3. Societal Impact Analysis\nSocietal impacts cover aspects such as energy independence, access to clean energy, and improvements in public health.\n\n### Sample Code Structure\n\nHere's a conceptual structure in C#:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nnamespace SolarEnergyImpactAnalysis\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            double latitude = 37.7749; // Los Angeles\n            double longitude = -122.4194;\n            DateTime currentDate = DateTime.Now;\n            double solarEnergyPotential = CalculateSolarEnergyPotential(latitude, longitude, currentDate);\n\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Solar Energy Potential for {latitude}, {longitude} on {currentDate}: {solarEnergyPotential} kW/m^2\");\n\n            double co2Reduction = CalculateEnvironmentalImpact(solarEnergyPotential);\n            double economicBenefits = CalculateEconomicImpact(solarEnergyPotential);\n            double societalBenefits = CalculateSocietalImpact(solarEnergyPotential);\n\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Estimated CO2 Reduction: {co2Reduction} tonnes\");\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Estimated Economic Benefits: ${economicBenefits}\");\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Estimated Societal Benefits Score: {societalBenefits}\");\n        }\n\n        static double CalculateSolarEnergyPotential(double latitude, double longitude, DateTime currentDate)\n        {\n            // Simplified calculation based on location and time\n            return 5.0; // Example fixed value in kW/m^2\n        }\n\n        static double CalculateEnvironmentalImpact(double solarEnergyPotential)\n        {\n            // Assume 1 kW/m^2 of solar energy replaces X tonnes of CO2\n            double co2ReductionPerKW = 0.85; // Example value\n            return solarEnergyPotential * co2ReductionPerKW;\n        }\n\n        static double CalculateEconomicImpact(double solarEnergyPotential)\n        {\n            // Assume 1 kW/m^2 leads to Y dollars of economic benefit\n            double economicBenefitPerKW = 1500; // Example value\n            return solarEnergyPotential * economicBenefitPerKW;\n        }\n\n        static double CalculateSocietalImpact(double solarEnergyPotential)\n        {\n            // Assume benefits are measured on a scale of 1 to 10\n            double societalBenefitScore = 7; // Example fixed score\n            return societalBenefitScore;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Environmental Impact**: The function `CalculateEnvironmentalImpact` estimates CO2 reduction based on the energy potential. You can adjust the conversion factor to match real-world data.\n\n2. **Economic Impact**: The function `CalculateEconomicImpact` calculates economic benefits, which can include cost savings on energy, job creation, etc. Adjust the conversion factor based on real economic data.\n\n3. **Societal Impact**: The function `CalculateSocietalImpact` provides a qualitative score.
