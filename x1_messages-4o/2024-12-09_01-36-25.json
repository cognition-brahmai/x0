        "content": "Yes, you can rename columns in a Pandas DataFrame by their positions using a combination of techniques. Even if you don't know the actual column names, you can access them by their positions using the DataFrame's `.columns` attribute, which is an index object. Here's how you can do it:\n\nSuppose you have a DataFrame `df` and you want to rename the columns by their positions. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    'A': [1, 2, 3],\n    'B': [4, 5, 6],\n    'C': [7, 8, 9]\n})\n\n# Renaming columns by their positions\n# For example, renaming the first and third columns\nnew_column_names = list(df.columns)\nnew_column_names[0] = 'X'  # Renaming the first column\nnew_column_names[2] = 'Z'  # Renaming the third column\n\n# Assigning the new column names back to the DataFrame\ndf.columns = new_column_names\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nIn this example, we accessed the columns by their positions (0-based index) and assigned new names. You can modify `new_column_names` list according to your needs and reassign it to `df.columns` to update the DataFrame with the new column names."
