Here's an example of how you might arrange colors in a table while following your guidelines:\n\n| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 | Header 4 |\n|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n|          | **Blue** | **Green** |          |\n| **Red**  |          | **Blue** | **Green** |\n| **Green**| **Red**  |          | **Blue**  |\n|          |          |          |          |\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Color Usage**: \n  - **Blue** appears in the second cell of the first row, the third cell of the second row, and the last cell of the third row.\n  - **Green** is used in the third cell of the first row, the last cell of the second row, and the first cell of the third row.\n  - **Red** is present in the first cell of the second row and the second cell of the third row.\n\n- **Non-Colored Row and Column**: \n  - The last row contains no colored cells.\n  - The first column of the first row and the last column of the first row are left without any colors.\n\nThis arrangement ensures a balanced distribution of colors across the table while maintaining areas without color for contrast and focus."
