        "content": "Building an API with a \"ping\" endpoint using Flask and Flask-RESTful is straightforward. Below is a simple step-by-step guide to help you set it up:\n\n1. **Install Flask and Flask-RESTful**: If you haven't installed these packages yet, you can do so using pip.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install Flask Flask-RESTful\n   ```\n\n2. **Create the Flask application**: You can create a new Python file (e.g., `app.py`) and set up your Flask application.\n\n3. **Define the Ping Resource**: Use Flask-RESTful to create a resource for your \"ping\" endpoint.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple example:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\nfrom flask_restful import Resource, Api\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napi = Api(app)\n\nclass Ping(Resource):\n    def get(self):\n        return {'message': 'pong'}, 200\n\napi.add_resource(Ping, '/ping')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n4. **Run your application**: You can run your Flask application using the command:\n\n   ```bash\n   python app.py\n   ```\n\n5. **Test the \"ping\" endpoint**: Once your application is running, you can test the endpoint by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/ping` in your web browser or using a tool like `curl` or Postman. You should receive a JSON response with `{\"message\": \"pong\"}`.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Flask** is used to create the web application.\n- **Flask-RESTful** is an extension for Flask that simplifies building REST APIs.\n- **Resource**: In Flask-RESTful, a Resource is a class that defines HTTP methods (like GET, POST) as class methods.\n- **add_resource()**: This method is used to bind the resource to a specific URL endpoint.\n\nThis setup provides a simple API with a single \"ping\" endpoint that responds to GET requests with a \"pong\" message. You can expand upon this by adding more resources and endpoints as needed."
