        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to an incompatibility between the version of `pip` and the Python version you're using. This issue typically arises when the `pip` installation is not aligned with the newly installed Python version. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to resolve it:\n\n1. **Install Python 3.6 and Update Alternatives:**\n   First, ensure Python 3.6 is correctly installed and set as the default Python 3 version.\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt update\n   sudo apt install python3.6 python3.6-venv python3.6-dev\n   ```\n\n   You can also use `update-alternatives` to manage different Python versions:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.6 1\n   ```\n\n2. **Get pip for Python 3.6:**\n   The issue with `pip` usually stems from using an old version. Here\u2019s how to install a compatible `pip` for Python 3.6:\n\n   ```bash\n   wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py\n   python3.6 get-pip.py\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify Installation:**\n   Make sure `pip` is installed for Python 3.6:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.6 -m pip --version\n   ```\n\n4. **Set Up Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**\n   It\u2019s often best to work within a virtual environment to avoid conflicting packages:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.6 -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n   Once activated, any `pip` installations will be contained within this environment.\n\n5. **Reinstall Packages:**\n   If you had specific packages installed under the old Python version, you might need to reinstall them in this new setup.\n\n6. **Troubleshooting Additional Errors:**\n   If you encounter more errors, such as missing modules like `apt_pkg`, you may need to install additional development packages:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt install python3.6-distutils\n   sudo apt install python3.6-apt\n   ```\n\n7. **Cleaning Up:**\n   After upgrading, it might also help to clean up any previous installations that could cause conflicts:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt autoremove\n   ```\n\nFollowing these steps should resolve the pip compatibility issues with Python 3.6. If you continue to experience issues, ensure that your PATH environment variable is correctly set to point to Python 3.6 and its associated pip."
