        "content": "The `eval` function in Python is designed to evaluate expressions, not execute statements. This is why you encountered a `SyntaxError` when trying to use `eval('x = 1')`. In Python, an assignment like `x = 1` is considered a statement, not an expression. The `eval` function expects an expression that returns a value, whereas assignment doesn't return a value; it simply assigns a value to a variable.\n\nIf you want to execute an assignment or any other statement dynamically, you should use the `exec` function instead of `eval`. Here\u2019s how you can use `exec` to achieve your goal:\n\n```python\nexec('x = 1')\nprint(x)  # This will print 1\n```\n\nIn this code, `exec` is used to execute the string as a Python statement, which allows you to assign the value 1 to the variable `x`. Unlike `eval`, `exec` can execute dynamic Python code, including assignments and other complex statements."
