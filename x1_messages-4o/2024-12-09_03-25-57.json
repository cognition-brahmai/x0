To hide stderr on Linux/OSX, I use the following code:\n\n```python\nf = open(\"/dev/null\",\"w\")\nzookeeper.set_log_stream(f)\n```\nIs there a cross-platform alternative to \"/dev/null\" that I could use? Ideally, this alternative should not consume memory as this is a part of a long-running process."

        "content": "Yes, there is a cross-platform way to handle this in Python. You can use `os.devnull` which provides a platform-independent way to access the equivalent of `/dev/null` on Windows as well as Unix-like systems. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Open the null device using os.devnull\nf = open(os.devnull, \"w\")\nzookeeper.set_log_stream(f)\n```\n\nBy using `os.devnull`, Python automatically determines the correct null device for the operating system, making your code portable across different platforms. This method will not consume memory and works effectively for long-running processes."
