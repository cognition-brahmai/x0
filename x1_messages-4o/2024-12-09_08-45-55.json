        "content": "Yes, dealing with blocking HTTP requests in Python can be challenging, especially when you want to ensure that your program can handle interrupts like Ctrl+C gracefully. Here are a few strategies you can use to address this issue:\n\n1. **Use a Timeout:**\n   Set a timeout for your HTTP requests. This ensures that if a request takes too long, it will be aborted, allowing your program to continue processing. You can use the `timeout` parameter available in `urllib2`. Note that `urllib2` is a module available in Python 2, and it's recommended to use `requests` in Python 3.\n\n   ```python\n   import urllib2\n\n   try:\n       response = urllib2.urlopen(url, timeout=10)\n   except urllib2.URLError as e:\n       print(f\"Failed to retrieve data: {e}\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Use the `requests` Library:**\n   If you are using Python 3, consider switching to the `requests` library, which is more modern and provides better functionality.\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n\n   try:\n       response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)\n   except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n       print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Use Signal Handling:**\n   Utilize Python's `signal` module to handle interrupts. This approach involves capturing the interrupt signal and taking appropriate action.\n\n   ```python\n   import signal\n   import sys\n\n   def signal_handler(sig, frame):\n       print('Exiting gracefully...')\n       sys.exit(0)\n\n   signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)\n   ```\n\n4. **Run HTTP Requests in Separate Threads or Processes:**\n   If you are using threads, ensure that they are daemon threads, which will allow the main program to exit even if the threads are still running.\n\n   ```python\n   import threading\n\n   def http_request():\n       # your HTTP request logic here\n       pass\n\n   thread = threading.Thread(target=http_request)\n   thread.daemon = True\n   thread.start()\n   ```\n\n   Alternatively, consider using the `multiprocessing` module, which runs requests in separate processes, making it easier to kill:\n\n   ```python\n   from multiprocessing import Process\n\n   def http_request():\n       # your HTTP request logic here\n       pass\n\n   process = Process(target=http_request)\n   process.start()\n   ```\n\n5. **Event Loop with `asyncio`:**\n   If your application architecture allows, you can consider using asynchronous programming with `asyncio` in Python 3, which can handle HTTP requests asynchronously and is generally non-blocking.\n\nBy implementing one or more of these strategies, you should be able to handle HTTP requests in a non-blocking manner and allow your program to respond to interrupt signals like Ctrl+C effectively."
