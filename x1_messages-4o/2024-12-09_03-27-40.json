The most common encoding is UTF-8.\n\nHere's how you can convert a bytes object to a string:\n\n```python\nbinary_string = b'a string'\nnormal_string = binary_string.decode('utf-8')\nprint(normal_string)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\na string\n```\n\nThis method uses the `decode` method, which converts bytes to a string by interpreting the bytes using the specified character encoding. UTF-8 is generally a safe choice unless you know that the bytes are encoded with a different encoding."
