The range-lists are sorted by their starting index and I want to create a generator that yields these ranges in ascending order based on the starting index. I am thinking about achieving this by popping the front off the list of the tuple that has the smallest starting index in its range list. How can I find the index of the tuple that contains the minimum range using Python? The structure I have is as follows:\n\n```python\nitems = [([[0, 1], [2, 20]], 'zz', ''), ([[1, 3], [5, 29], [50, 500]], 'a', 'b')]\n```\n\nI have this code so far:\n\n```python\n[ min (items[i][0]) for i in range(len(items)) ]\n```\n\nThis gives me the first item in each list, but it fails when any of the lists becomes empty. Also, it is not clear how to get the index to use with `pop()` without looking it back up in the list. The generator should return the following:\n\n```python\n([0,1], 'zz', '')\n([1,3], 'a', 'b')\n([2,20], 'zz', '')\n([5,29], 'a', 'b')\n([50,500], 'a', 'b')\n```\n\nOr more efficiently, I only need this data:\n\n```python\n[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n```\n\nThese are the indices of the tuples I want to take the front item of."

        "content": "To achieve the desired output, we can use a priority queue (or min-heap) to efficiently find and pop the smallest starting range from the list of tuples. Python's `heapq` module is perfect for this task. Here\u2019s how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef range_generator(items):\n    # Create a priority queue (min-heap)\n    heap = []\n    \n    # Initialize the heap with the first range from each tuple, if available\n    for index, (ranges, *rest) in enumerate(items):\n        if ranges:  # Ensure there is at least one range\n            # Push a tuple of (start_index, index of the tuple, rest of the tuple)\n            heapq.heappush(heap, (ranges[0][0], index, ranges[0], rest))\n    \n    # Process the heap\n    while heap:\n        # Pop the smallest start index range from the heap\n        start_index, item_index, range_item, rest = heapq.heappop(heap)\n        \n        # Yield the required data\n        yield item_index  # or yield (range_item, *rest) for full details\n        \n        # Remove the range from the original list\n        items[item_index][0].pop(0)\n        \n        # If there are more ranges left in this tuple, push the next one to the heap\n        if items[item_index][0]:\n            next_range = items[item_index][0][0]\n            heapq.heappush(heap, (next_range[0], item_index, next_range, rest))\n\n# Example usage\nitems = [([[0, 1], [2, 20]], 'zz', ''), ([[1, 3], [5, 29], [50, 500]], 'a', 'b')]\ngenerator = range_generator(items)\n\n# Generate the output\nresult = list(generator)  # [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Heap Initialization**: We start by initializing a min-heap and add the first range from each tuple, along with the tuple index and the rest of the tuple data.\n\n2. **Heap Processing**: We repeatedly pop the smallest starting range from the heap, yield the index of the tuple, and pop the range from the list in `items`.\n\n3. **Re-heapifying**: If there are more ranges in the current tuple, we push the next range from that tuple onto the heap.\n\nThis implementation efficiently finds and processes the range with the smallest starting index, while maintaining the order of the tuples in the output list."
