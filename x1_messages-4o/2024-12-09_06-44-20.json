        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to changes in the pandas library. In recent versions of pandas, the `pandas.tools` module has been deprecated and removed. Specifically, functions related to plotting have been moved to a different module.\n\nTo access `autocorrelation_plot` and other plotting functions, you should use the `pandas.plotting` module instead. Here's how you can import `autocorrelation_plot`:\n\n```python\nfrom pandas.plotting import autocorrelation_plot\n```\n\nIf you're working with an older codebase or tutorial, it's possible that it was written for an earlier version of pandas. Updating the import statement as shown above should resolve the issue for the latest versions of pandas. Make sure you have the latest version of pandas installed to ensure compatibility with the latest features and fixes. You can upgrade pandas using:\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade pandas\n```\n\nThis should help you access the plotting functionalities without any issues."
