Currently, I am using a function as shown below:\n\n```python\ndef bytes_to_int(bytes):\n  return int(bytes.encode('hex'), 16)\n```\n\nIn this function, I am converting a big endian binary byte array (for example, '\\x11\\x34' which represents 4404) to an integer. Although this function is small and somewhat readable, I am not sure about its efficiency. Is there a better or more obvious way to achieve this?"

        "content": "You can achieve this more efficiently by using Python's built-in `int.from_bytes()` method, which is specifically designed for this purpose. This method converts a byte array into an integer using specified byte order (big or little endian). Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\ndef bytes_to_int(byte_array):\n    return int.from_bytes(byte_array, byteorder='big')\n```\n\nIn this function, `byteorder='big'` specifies that the byte array is in big-endian order. If your byte array were in little-endian order, you would use `byteorder='little'`.\n\nHere's how you would use this function:\n\n```python\nbyte_array = b'\\x11\\x34'\nresult = bytes_to_int(byte_array)\nprint(result)  # Output: 4404\n```\n\nThis approach is more efficient and more readable than the method using `encode('hex')`, as it directly converts the byte array into an integer without intermediate string conversion steps."
