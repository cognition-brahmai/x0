How can I modify my code to ensure that the website I'm trying to access actually exists?\n\n```python\nuser_agent = 'Mozilla/20.0.1 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows NT)'\nheaders = { 'User-Agent':user_agent }\nlink = \"http://www.abc.com\"\nreq = urllib2.Request(link, headers = headers)\npage = urllib2.urlopen(req).read() # ERROR 402 generated here!\n```"

        "content": "The 402 error code generally indicates a \"Payment Required\" status, which is not typically used, but some websites might use it for custom purposes. However, to check if a website exists, you can handle HTTP errors and check the response code. You should also consider using the `requests` library, which simplifies HTTP requests in Python. Here's a modified version of your code using `requests`:\n\nFirst, make sure you have the `requests` library installed. You can install it via pip if you haven't done so already:\n\n```bash\npip install requests\n```\n\nThen, you can use the following code to check if a website exists:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef check_website_exists(url):\n    try:\n        # Sending a HEAD request to just get headers, not the full content\n        response = requests.head(url, allow_redirects=True, headers={'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'})\n        \n        # Checking if the status code indicates success (200-399 range)\n        if response.status_code == 200:\n            print(f\"The website {url} exists.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"The website {url} returned a status code: {response.status_code}\")\n    \n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        # Handle all exceptions (e.g., network issues, invalid URL)\n        print(f\"Error accessing {url}: {e}\")\n\n# Example usage\ncheck_website_exists(\"http://www.abc.com\")\n```\n\n**Key points in this solution:**\n- We use a `HEAD` request instead of `GET` to check for existence without downloading the entire page content.\n- We handle exceptions that can arise from network issues or invalid URLs using `requests.exceptions.RequestException`.\n- The `allow_redirects=True` parameter is used to follow redirects, which is common when accessing websites.\n\nThis code should help determine if a website exists by checking the HTTP response status code."
