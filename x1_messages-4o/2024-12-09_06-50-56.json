In the given code, I am trying to emit a message only to the first client in the 'clients' list.

        "content": "To emit a message to a specific client using Flask-SocketIO, you need to utilize the unique session ID associated with each connected client. In your code, the `clients` list stores tuples containing the client's name and its corresponding namespace (which includes the session ID). You can use this session ID to target specific clients.\n\nFirst, ensure that you are capturing the session ID correctly when a client connects. Then, you can use this ID to emit messages specifically to that client.\n\nHere's a revised version of your code that demonstrates how to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import session, request\nfrom flask_socketio import emit, join_room, Namespace\n\nclients = []\n\n@socketio.on('joined', namespace='/chat')\ndef joined(message):\n    \"\"\"Sent by clients when they enter a room.\n    A status message is broadcast to all people in the room.\"\"\"\n    # Add client to client list with their session ID\n    client_id = request.sid\n    clients.append({'name': session.get('name'), 'id': client_id})\n    \n    room = session.get('room')\n    join_room(room)\n    emit('status', {'msg': session.get('name') + ' has entered the room.'}, room=room)\n    \n    # Emit message to the first client specifically\n    if clients:\n        first_client_id = clients[0]['id']\n        emit('status', {'msg': session.get('name') + ' has entered the room.'},\n             to=first_client_id)  # Use 'to' to target specific session ID\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Session ID**: Use `request.sid` to get a unique session ID for each connected client. This ID is used to target specific clients.\n2. **Emit to Specific Client**: Use the `to` argument in `emit` to specify the session ID of the client you want to send the message to.\n3. **Namespace and Room**: Ensure you are using the correct namespace and room if needed. Here, it's assumed you want to emit to a specific client rather than a room.\n\nRemember, this code assumes that the session contains a 'name' and 'room' key. Make sure your session management is set up correctly to store and retrieve these values."
