The person is carrying a heavy backpack with various camping equipment, including a map, a compass, and a flashlight. In addition to the verbs, provide the exact time it would take for the person to reach a specific location marked on the map, assuming the person maintains a steady pace of 3 miles per hour, and encounters various obstacles such as fallen trees and streams. Also, provide the Latin name for at least one type of tree commonly found in this forest, and describe the unique features of its bark and leaves. Finally, provide a haiku poem that captures the essence of the person's experience walking through the forest."

At a steady pace of 3 miles per hour, without accounting for obstacles, it would take 2 hours. However, given the various obstacles like fallen trees and streams, we can estimate an additional 30 minutes to 1 hour for detours and challenges. Therefore, it would take approximately 2.5 to 3 hours to reach the destination.\n\n### Tree Description:\n\nOne commonly found tree in such a forest could be the **Quercus rubra**, also known as the Northern Red Oak. \n\n- **Bark**: The bark of the Northern Red Oak is dark gray and features long, flat ridges that resemble ski trails running down the trunk. This unique texture provides a striking contrast to the surrounding forest.\n- **Leaves**: Its leaves are large, with 7 to 11 lobes and pointed tips, and they turn a brilliant red in autumn, providing a vivid splash of color in the forest.\n\n### Haiku Poem:\n\nIn moonlit silence,  \nSteps echo through shadowed woods,  \nNature's path unfolds."
