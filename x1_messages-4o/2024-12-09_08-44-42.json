Here are some steps to resolve this issue and get you started with Django on macOS:\n\n### Step 1: Install Python (if not already installed)\nSince you're using macOS, Python 2.7 comes pre-installed. However, it's highly recommended to use Python 3 for new projects, as Python 2 has reached its end of life.\n\n1. **Install Homebrew** (if you haven't already):\n   Open Terminal and install Homebrew by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Python 3**:\n   Use Homebrew to install Python 3:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew install python\n   ```\n\n### Step 2: Install Virtual Environment\nIt's a good practice to use a virtual environment for Python projects to manage dependencies separately.\n\n1. **Install `virtualenv`**:\n   Use pip to install the virtual environment package:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip3 install virtualenv\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:\n   Navigate to your desired project directory and create a virtual environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd ~/your-project-directory\n   virtualenv venv\n   ```\n\n3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:\n   Activate it using:\n\n   ```bash\n   source venv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Install Django\nWithin the activated virtual environment, install Django:\n\n```bash\npip install django\n```\n\n### Step 4: Create a Django Project\nNow, you can use the `django-admin` command to start a new Django project:\n\n```bash\ndjango-admin startproject hellodjango\n```\n\n### Step 5: Running Your Django App Locally\n1. Navigate to your project directory:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd hellodjango\n   ```\n\n2. Run the development server:\n\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py runserver\n   ```\n\nVisit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your web browser to see your Django app in action.\n\n### Recommended Guide for Django on Mac\n- **Django's Official Documentation**: The official Django documentation is extensive and well-written. It includes a beginner-friendly tutorial that walks you through creating a simple Django project.\n\n- **Real Python**: Real Python offers a variety of tutorials and courses for learning Django, often with examples relevant to modern web development.\n\n- **Django Girls Tutorial**: This is an excellent beginner tutorial that guides you through setting up a Django project, and it's specifically designed for people new to programming.\n\nBy following these steps and resources, you should be able to set up and run a Django app on your Mac successfully. Feel free to ask if you have any more questions!"
