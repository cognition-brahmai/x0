I am able to run TensorFlow commands in the Python interpreter with no issues. However, when I try to run code in a Jupyter notebook, I am unable to import even basic Python libraries. I created a new directory outside of the 'tensorflow' environment and activated the 'tensorflow' environment there. I then opened a Jupyter notebook, but when I try to import libraries like pandas, it says \"no packages available\". Despite being in the same directory and using the same environment, the Python interpreter shows all packages but the Jupyter notebook does not. Why is the Jupyter notebook not picking up these modules?"

        "content": "This issue often arises due to the Jupyter Notebook not being properly linked to the 'tensorflow' environment's Python interpreter. Here are the steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Jupyter is Installed in the Environment**: First, make sure that Jupyter is installed within your 'tensorflow' environment. Activate the environment and run:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda activate tensorflow\n   conda install jupyter\n   ```\n\n2. **Check the Kernel**: Sometimes, the Jupyter Notebook may be using a different Python kernel that is not associated with your 'tensorflow' environment. To make sure it uses the correct environment, you need to install the IPython kernel for the environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m ipykernel install --user --name=tensorflow\n   ```\n\n   This will create a new kernel named 'tensorflow'. When you launch Jupyter Notebook, you can select this kernel from the Kernel menu.\n\n3. **Launch Jupyter from the Environment**: Always launch Jupyter Notebook from within the activated environment. This ensures that the notebook server is running in the same environment. \n\n   ```bash\n   conda activate tensorflow\n   jupyter notebook\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify Environment Path**: Sometimes, it's helpful to verify that the Jupyter Notebook is using the correct Python interpreter. You can do this by running the following in a notebook cell:\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   print(sys.executable)\n   ```\n\n   This should point to the Python executable in your 'tensorflow' environment.\n\n5. **Re-check Package Installation**: Double-check that all necessary packages (like pandas) are installed in the 'tensorflow' environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda list\n   ```\n\n   If any package is missing, install it using:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda install pandas\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to run Jupyter Notebook with the correct environment and have access to all the installed packages."
