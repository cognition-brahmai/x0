Here\u2019s how you can structure your hypothesis using the given mathematical formula:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{If } A \\text{ is true, is } B \\text{ also true?}}{\\text{Hypothesis: } A \\implies B}\n\\]\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- The `\\documentclass{article}` line specifies the document class.\n- The `\\usepackage{amsmath}` line includes the AMS math package, which provides additional formatting features for mathematical expressions.\n- The `\\text{}` command is used to insert non-italicized text within the mathematical environment.\n- The `\\frac{}` command formats the statement and question as a fraction, with the question as the numerator and the hypothesis as the denominator.\n\nThis code will produce a formatted hypothesis statement in LaTeX, blending both text and mathematical elements seamlessly."
