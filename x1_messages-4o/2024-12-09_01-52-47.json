For instance, using string.join((\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"), \".\") would return \"a.b.c\". However, it seems like this method has been removed in Python 3. What is the Python 3 equivalent of the string.join() method?"

Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nresult = \".\".join([\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"])\nprint(result)  # Output: a.b.c\n```\n\nIn this example, `\".\"` is the separator string, and `[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]` is the iterable containing the strings you want to join. The method will place the separator between each pair of strings in the iterable and return the resulting string. This is the direct equivalent of `string.join()` from Python 2."
