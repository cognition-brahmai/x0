I can only use the default libraries and I need to ensure that the values are individual and not linked to the same pointer as the multiplication method (i.e., `[[0]*n]*n`) doesn't seem to work for this."

        "content": "To create a 3D array in Python 2.7 without using external libraries and ensuring that each value is independent (not linked to the same pointer), you can use list comprehensions to properly initialize the array. The issue with the multiplication method (e.g., `[[0]*n]*n`) is that it copies the reference to the inner lists, causing them to point to the same list, which is not what you want.\n\nHere's how you can create a 3D array with dimensions `n * n * n`:\n\n```python\nn = 3  # Example size, you can use your variable here\n\n# Use nested list comprehensions to create an independent 3D array\ndistance = [[[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Print the 3D array to check its structure\nfor layer in distance:\n    print(layer)\n```\n\nThis code snippet initializes a 3D array where each element is set to `0` and ensures that each sub-array is distinct and not linked to the same memory location. You can replace `0` with any initial value you want to populate the 3D array with."
