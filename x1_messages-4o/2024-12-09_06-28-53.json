However, I am unsure if Celery allows tasks to be run from within tasks, and if so, how can this be easily achieved? More specifically, I have a `compute` task that gets called from celerybeat, but it causes an IOError when it attempts to run `apply_async`. Here is my code:\n\n```python\n@task\ndef compute(users=None):\n    if users is None:\n        users = User.objects.all()\n\n    tasks = []\n    for user in users:\n        tasks.append(compute_for_user.subtask((user.id,)))\n\n    job = TaskSet(tasks)\n    job.apply_async() # raises a IOError: Socket closed\n\n@task\ndef compute_for_user(user_id):\n    #do some stuff\n```\n\nCould you provide any ideas on how to solve this issue?"

        "content": "Certainly! It appears that you're attempting to run a group of tasks (using `TaskSet`) from within a parent task (`compute`). This is a common use case in Celery, but the Socket closed IOError indicates that there might be an issue with the way the tasks are being dispatched or with the broker connection. Let's go through a few steps and suggestions to help troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Broker and Worker Configuration:** \n   - Make sure your message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis) is running and properly configured. Check the broker URL in your Celery configuration.\n   - Ensure that your Celery workers are running and connected to the correct broker.\n\n2. **Use Celery Groups:**\n   - Instead of using `TaskSet`, you can use `celery.group`, which is a more recent and preferred way to manage a collection of tasks. Here\u2019s how you can modify your code:\n\n   ```python\n   from celery import group\n\n   @task\n   def compute(users=None):\n       if users is None:\n           users = User.objects.all()\n\n       tasks = (compute_for_user.s(user.id) for user in users)\n       job = group(tasks)\n       job.apply_async()\n\n   @task\n   def compute_for_user(user_id):\n       # do some stuff\n   ```\n\n3. **Check Celery Logs:**\n   - Review logs for both the Celery worker and the broker for any errors or disconnection messages. This can give you more insight into why the `IOError` is occurring.\n\n4. **Error Handling:**\n   - Implement error handling in your tasks to capture any exceptions that may occur during execution. This can help pinpoint the issue further.\n\n5. **Broker Timeout Settings:**\n   - Sometimes, the broker connection can time out if the tasks take too long to execute. Adjust the timeout settings in your Celery configuration if necessary.\n\n6. **Inspect Network and Firewall Settings:**\n   - Ensure there are no network issues or firewall rules that might be closing the connection between your application and the broker.\n\n7. **Resource Limitation:**\n   - Check if your system resources (CPU, memory) are sufficient for running the tasks. Overloaded systems can sometimes cause unexpected behavior.\n\nBy following these steps and suggestions, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue with running tasks from within other tasks in Celery. If the problem persists, consider providing more detailed logs or context for further assistance."
