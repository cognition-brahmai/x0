However, you can achieve the same result by filtering the DataFrame as you've done. Here's a more streamlined version of your code:\n\n```python\nmean_value = df[df['A'] != 0]['A'].mean()\n```\n\nThis code snippet filters out the zero values in column 'A' and then calculates the mean of the non-zero values. If you want to apply this to multiple columns, you can use the `.apply()` function:\n\n```python\nmean_values = df.apply(lambda col: col[col != 0].mean())\n```\n\nThis will give you the mean of non-zero values for each column in the DataFrame."
