However, I'd like to host the script on a server where I don't have installation privileges. How can I use 'tweepy' library locally without installing it? Currently, I'm importing the library using `import tweepy`. I want to replace this with importing from a local folder, something like `import local_folder/tweepy/*`."

        "content": "To use the `tweepy` library locally without installing it on the server, you can manually include the library in your project directory. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n1. **Download Tweepy:**\n   - First, you need to download the `tweepy` source files. You can do this by cloning the repository from GitHub or downloading the package from the Python Package Index (PyPI).\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy.git\n   ```\n\n   or\n\n   ```bash\n   pip download tweepy\n   ```\n\n2. **Extract Files (if necessary):**\n   - If you downloaded a compressed file from PyPI, extract it to get the `tweepy` folder.\n\n3. **Copy the Tweepy Folder:**\n   - Copy the `tweepy` directory that contains the module files into your project directory. Ensure the directory structure is maintained as it is in the source.\n\n4. **Modify Your Import Statement:**\n   - Since the `tweepy` folder is now in your project directory, you can import it directly. Make sure the `tweepy` directory is at the same level as your script or adjust the path accordingly.\n\n   ```python\n   from tweepy import API, OAuthHandler  # or any specific classes you need\n   ```\n\n   If your script and the `tweepy` folder are in different directories, you can modify the Python path to include the directory where `tweepy` resides:\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   sys.path.insert(0, '/path/to/tweepy')\n\n   from tweepy import API, OAuthHandler\n   ```\n\n5. **Ensure Compatibility:**\n   - If your script relies on other dependencies that `tweepy` uses, you may also need to download and include those dependencies similarly.\n\nThis method allows you to bypass installation privileges on the server while still using the `tweepy` library in your Python script. Make sure to comply with any licensing requirements when distributing or deploying third-party code."
