When I try to print it using pprint, it gives the output as `['Hello', 'Good Morning', 'Good Evening', 'Good Night', 'Bye']`. Can someone help me to print each value of the array on a separate line, without the quotes, commas, and brackets? I would like the output to look like this: \n\nHello\nGood Morning\nGood Evening\nGood Night\nBye"

        "content": "Certainly! To print each element of the array on a separate line without the quotes, commas, and brackets, you can iterate through the list and print each element individually. Here's a simple way to achieve that in Python:\n\n```python\nop = ['Hello', 'Good Morning', 'Good Evening', 'Good Night', 'Bye']\n\nfor item in op:\n    print(item)\n```\n\nThis code will loop through each item in the list `op` and print it on a new line, giving you the desired output:\n\n```\nHello\nGood Morning\nGood Evening\nGood Night\nBye\n```\n\nThis method ensures that each element is printed one by one, just as you want."
