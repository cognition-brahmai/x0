        "content": "To instruct pytest to ignore specific files or directories, you have a few options. Here\u2019s how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Use `pytest.ini` or `tox.ini` or `setup.cfg` Configuration File**:\n   You can configure pytest to ignore certain files or directories by adding a `python_files` pattern in your configuration file (e.g., `pytest.ini`, `tox.ini`, or `setup.cfg`). For example:\n\n   ```ini\n   [pytest]\n   python_files = test_*.py *_test.py  # default patterns\n   ```\n\n   Since you can't change the file name and want pytest to ignore it, you can modify this pattern to exclude your specific file. However, this approach is more suitable for specifying which files to include rather than exclude specific ones.\n\n2. **Use `--ignore` Command-Line Option**:\n   You can run pytest with the `--ignore` option to explicitly ignore the file or directory you don't want pytest to collect. For example:\n\n   ```bash\n   pytest --ignore=src/my_project/build/private/python2.7/lib/foo/my_file_test.py\n   ```\n\n   You can also use a directory if you want to ignore all files in it:\n\n   ```bash\n   pytest --ignore=src/my_project/build/private/python2.7/lib\n   ```\n\n3. **Modify `conftest.py` to Selectively Collect Tests**:\n   You can use `conftest.py` to customize test collection. Specifically, you can define a `pytest_ignore_collect` hook to programmatically ignore specific paths:\n\n   ```python\n   # conftest.py\n   def pytest_ignore_collect(path, config):\n       if \"my_file_test.py\" in str(path):\n           return True\n       return False\n   ```\n\n   This hook will be called for each path pytest wants to collect, and you can return `True` to ignore specific files.\n\n4. **Use a `.gitignore` style file**:\n   If you have a `.gitignore`-like file for pytest, such as `.pytest_ignore` (not a built-in feature, but can be implemented with a custom hook), you can list files or patterns there to ignore.\n\nChoose the method that suits your workflow best. The `--ignore` option and the `pytest_ignore_collect` hook in `conftest.py` are usually the most straightforward for ignoring specific files or patterns."
