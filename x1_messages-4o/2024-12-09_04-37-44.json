My aim is to obtain the document vectors for all my training documents. However, I am only able to find 10 vectors in `model.docvecs`. This issue persists even when I use other datasets with lengths greater than 100 or 1000. How can I use `model.docvecs` to get all vectors, without using `model.infer_vector`? Is `model.docvecs` designed to provide all training document vectors?\n\nHere is the code I've used:\n\n```python\ndocs = ['This is a sentence', 'This is another sentence', ....]\ndoc_=[d.strip().split(\" \") for d in doc]\ndoc_tagged = []\nfor i in range(len(doc_)):\n  tagd = TaggedDocument(doc_[i],str(i))\n  doc_tagged.append(tagd)\n\nmodel = Doc2Vec(min_count=1, window=10, size=100, sample=1e-4, negative=5, workers=8)\nmodel.build_vocab(doc_tagged)\nmodel.train(doc_tagged, total_examples= model.corpus_count, epochs= model.iter)\n\nlen(model.docvecs) # Outputs 10\n```"

        "content": "Let's address the issue you're facing with the `doc2vec` model where it appears that you are only obtaining 10 document vectors. There are several potential reasons for this, and I'll guide you through the common pitfalls and solutions.\n\n### Understanding `model.docvecs`\n\nThe `model.docvecs` (or `model.dv` in more recent versions) should contain a vector for each document in your training dataset. If you are only seeing a limited number of vectors (e.g., 10), it's typically due to how the tags are assigned or how the model is trained. Here are some steps and considerations to help resolve the issue:\n\n### Key Considerations and Solutions\n\n1. **Check Tagging Process:**\n   Ensure each document is tagged uniquely. In your code, you are using `str(i)` as the tag, which should be correct if `i` spans the entire length of your document list. Double-check that the length of `doc_tagged` equals the number of documents you have.\n\n2. **Ensure Proper Training:**\n   Make sure the training process is running correctly. The `train()` method should be called with appropriate parameters:\n   - `total_examples` should be equal to the length of `doc_tagged`.\n   - The number of `epochs` should be set appropriately. It seems you are using `model.iter`, which might not be defined. Ensure you specify a number like `epochs=20`.\n\n3. **Model Configuration:**\n   - Verify that the `size` parameter (or `vector_size` in newer versions) is set correctly. This determines the dimensionality of the document vectors.\n   - Ensure that `min_count=1` is appropriate for your dataset, as it controls the minimum frequency of words to be considered.\n\n4. **Check Gensim Version:**\n   Make sure you are using a compatible Gensim version. Some attributes and method signatures may vary. As of Gensim 4.0.0, `model.docvecs` has been replaced by `model.dv`.\n\n5. **Re-run with Updates:**\n   Here's an updated version of your code to ensure everything is set correctly:\n\n   ```python\n   from gensim.models.doc2vec import Doc2Vec, TaggedDocument\n\n   docs = ['This is a sentence', 'This is another sentence', ....]\n   doc_ = [d.strip().split(\" \") for d in docs]\n   doc_tagged = [TaggedDocument(words=doc_[i], tags=[str(i)]) for i in range(len(doc_))]\n\n   model = Doc2Vec(vector_size=100, window=10, min_count=1, sample=1e-4, negative=5, workers=8)\n\n   model.build_vocab(doc_tagged)\n   model.train(doc_tagged, total_examples=model.corpus_count, epochs=20)\n\n   print(len(model.dv))  # Should output the number of documents\n   ```\n\n### Debugging Steps\n\n- **Verify Correct Tags:** Print out the `tags` from the `doc_tagged` to ensure they are unique and correspond to each document correctly.\n- **Check Model Training:** Print some vectors from `model.dv` to ensure they are not zero vectors, which might indicate a training issue.\n- **Inspect Warnings/Errors:** Check the console for any warnings or errors during model training which might indicate issues.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to ensure that `model.docvecs` (or `model.dv`) includes the vectors for all your training documents. Ensure you have the correct version of Gensim and that your dataset tagging is consistent and aligned with the model's expectations."
