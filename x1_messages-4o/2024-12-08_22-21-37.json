        "content": "Sure! Let's break down the equation \\(2x + 3y = 4z\\) in simple terms.\n\n1. **Variables**: \n   - \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) are variables. They represent unknown numbers that can change or vary.\n\n2. **Coefficients**:\n   - The numbers in front of the variables (2, 3, and 4) are called coefficients. They tell you how many times you need to multiply the variable by.\n\n3. **Equation**:\n   - The equation states that when you take 2 times the value of \\(x\\) and add it to 3 times the value of \\(y\\), the result will be equal to 4 times the value of \\(z\\).\n\n4. **Balance**:\n   - The equals sign \\(=\\) indicates that both sides of the equation are balanced or equal to each other.\n\nIn simple terms, this equation is like a balance scale where the weight of \\(2x + 3y\\) on one side is equal to the weight of \\(4z\\) on the other side. You can think of it as a recipe where combining certain amounts of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) should yield a certain amount of \\(z\\)."
