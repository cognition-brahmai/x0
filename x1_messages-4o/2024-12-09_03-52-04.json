When I try to change `python = \"^2.7\"` to `python = \"^3.7\"` in the toml file, it results in a SolverProblemError when running `poetry install`. The error seems to be related to package compatibility issues with Python versions. The toml file code and the error message are as follows:\n\nToml file:\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname = \"poetry-demo\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\ndescription = \"\"\nauthors = [\"Harsha Goli <harshagoli@gmail.com>\"]\n\n[tool.poetry.dependencies]\npython = \"^2.7\"\n\n[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]\npytest = \"^4.6\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry>=0.12\"]\nbuild-backend = \"poetry.masonry.api\"\n```\nError message:\n```\n[SolverProblemError]\nThe current project's Python requirement (2.7.17) is not compatible with some of the required packages Python requirement:\n  - zipp requires Python >=3.6\n\nBecause no versions of pytest match >=4.6,<4.6.9 || >4.6.9,<5.0\n and pytest (4.6.9) depends on importlib-metadata (>=0.12), pytest (>=4.6,<5.0) requires importlib-metadata (>=0.12).\nAnd because no versions of importlib-metadata match >=0.12,<1.5.0 || >1.5.0\n and importlib-metadata (1.5.0) depends on zipp (>=0.5), pytest (>=4.6,<5.0) requires zipp (>=0.5).\nBecause zipp (3.1.0) requires Python >=3.6\n and no versions of zipp match >=0.5,<3.1.0 || >3.1.0, zipp is forbidden.\nThus, pytest is forbidden.\nSo, because poetry-demo depends on pytest (^4.6), version solving failed.\n```"

        "content": "To update your project to use Python 3.7 and resolve the `SolverProblemError`, you'll need to do a few steps in your `pyproject.toml` to ensure compatibility with the packages you are using. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you transition from Python 2.7 to Python 3.7 using Poetry:\n\n1. **Update the Python Requirement:**\n\n   In your `pyproject.toml`, change the Python version to `^3.7`:\n\n   ```toml\n   [tool.poetry.dependencies]\n   python = \"^3.7\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Update Dependencies:**\n\n   Since Python 2.7 is quite old and many packages have dropped support for it, you might need to update some of your dependencies to versions that are compatible with Python 3.7. For instance, `pytest` should be updated to a version compatible with Python 3.7. You can update your `pytest` version like this:\n\n   ```toml\n   [tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]\n   pytest = \"^6.0\"  # Or a more recent version compatible with your needs\n   ```\n\n3. **Remove the Lock File:**\n\n   If you already have a `poetry.lock` file, you should delete it. This file locks your project to specific versions of dependencies and might still be referencing old versions compatible with Python 2.7.\n\n   ```bash\n   rm poetry.lock\n   ```\n\n4. **Reinstall the Dependencies:**\n\n   Run `poetry install` to recreate the lock file and install the dependencies compatible with Python 3.7.\n\n   ```bash\n   poetry install\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify the Environment:**\n\n   Ensure that your virtual environment is using Python 3.7. You can check which Python version your virtual environment is using with:\n\n   ```bash\n   poetry env info\n   ```\n\n   If it\u2019s not using Python 3.7, you might need to recreate the virtual environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   poetry env use python3.7\n   ```\n\n6. **Check for Additional Compatibility Issues:**\n\n   If you run into further issues, check the documentation for the specific packages you're using to ensure they support Python 3.7 and adjust versions as necessary in your `pyproject.toml`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully transition your project from Python 2.7 to Python 3.7 using Poetry."
