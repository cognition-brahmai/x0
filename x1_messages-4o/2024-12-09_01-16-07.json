        "content": "To delete a specific record in Django, you can use the Django ORM to interact with your database in a way that's similar to using SQL commands. Here's how you can delete a specific record, for example, a record with a specific `id`, in Django:\n\n1. **Import your model:** Make sure to import the model class that represents the table you want to delete the record from.\n\n2. **Retrieve the object:** Use the model's `get()` method to retrieve the object you want to delete. You can specify the condition using keyword arguments.\n\n3. **Delete the object:** Once you have the object, you can call its `delete()` method to remove it from the database.\n\nHere is an example assuming you have a model named `MyModel` and you want to delete the record with `id = 1`:\n\n```python\nfrom myapp.models import MyModel\n\ntry:\n    # Retrieve the object with id = 1\n    record = MyModel.objects.get(id=1)\n    \n    # Delete the object\n    record.delete()\n    print(\"Record deleted successfully.\")\nexcept MyModel.DoesNotExist:\n    print(\"Record not found.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`MyModel.objects.get(id=1)`:** This tries to retrieve the record where the `id` is 1. If no such record exists, a `DoesNotExist` exception is raised.\n\n- **`record.delete()`:** This deletes the record from the database.\n\n- **Error Handling:** It's a good practice to handle the `DoesNotExist` exception to avoid errors if the record doesn't exist.\n\nMake sure you replace `myapp.models` and `MyModel` with your actual app and model names. Also, ensure your Django environment is properly set up with access to the database and the Django shell or script where you are running this code."
