        "content": "It seems like your system's PATH environment variable might not be set up correctly for Jupyter. This is a common issue when installing Python packages on Windows. Here's what you can do to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify Installation**: First, ensure that Jupyter is indeed installed. You can do this by running:\n   ```\n   pip show jupyter\n   ```\n   This command will display information about the Jupyter package if it's installed.\n\n2. **Locate the Executable**: The Jupyter executable is typically located in the `Scripts` directory of your Python installation. You can find it by navigating to your Python installation directory. For example, if Python is installed in `C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python38`, then Jupyter would be in:\n   ```\n   C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python38\\Scripts\n   ```\n\n3. **Add to PATH**: You need to add this `Scripts` directory to your system's PATH environment variable. Here's how you can do it:\n   - Right-click on 'This PC' or 'My Computer' and select 'Properties'.\n   - Click on 'Advanced system settings'.\n   - In the System Properties window, click on the 'Environment Variables' button.\n   - In the Environment Variables window, find the 'Path' variable in the 'System variables' section and select it, then click 'Edit'.\n   - Click 'New' and add the path to the `Scripts` directory. For example:\n     ```\n     C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python38\\Scripts\n     ```\n   - Click 'OK' to close all windows.\n\n4. **Restart the Command Prompt**: After updating the PATH variable, close any open Command Prompt windows and open a new one. This ensures the changes to the PATH variable take effect.\n\n5. **Test Jupyter**: Now, try running the `jupyter notebook` command again.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to run Jupyter Notebook from the command line without encountering the `'jupyter' is not recognized as an internal or external command'` error."
