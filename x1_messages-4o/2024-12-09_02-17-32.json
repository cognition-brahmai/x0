I have the following code:\n```python\nfrom boto.emr.connection import EmrConnection\nconn = EmrConnection(aws_keys.access_key_id, aws_keys.secret_key)\n```\nI want the editor to show me the available methods when I press Ctrl+Space. Even though the boto library is installed in my environment, it doesn't seem to be detected by PyCharm. How can I correctly set this up?"

        "content": "If PyCharm's autocomplete feature isn't working for a library you've installed, such as the `boto` library, there are several steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Interpreter is Set Correctly**:\n   - Go to `File > Settings` (or `PyCharm > Preferences` on macOS) and navigate to `Project: <YourProjectName> > Python Interpreter`.\n   - Ensure that the Python interpreter is set to the one where your `boto` library is installed. If it's not, you may need to add the correct interpreter.\n\n2. **Synchronize the Project**:\n   - Sometimes, PyCharm might need to refresh its indices. Go to `File > Synchronize` or right-click on the project root and select `Synchronize`.\n\n3. **Invalidate Caches / Restart**:\n   - Go to `File > Invalidate Caches / Restart`. This option clears PyCharm's cache and restarts the IDE, which can resolve issues with indexing and autocomplete.\n\n4. **Check Project Structure**:\n   - Ensure that the source root is set correctly. Right-click on your project folder in the Project pane and ensure it is marked as `Sources Root`.\n\n5. **Install the Package in the Project Environment**:\n   - Open the terminal in PyCharm and run `pip show boto` to check if the package is installed in the current environment.\n   - If it's not, install it using `pip install boto`.\n\n6. **Check for Errors**:\n   - Check the `Event Log` (usually at the bottom of PyCharm) for any error messages that might indicate problems with indexing or library detection.\n\n7. **Reconfigure the Python SDK**:\n   - Sometimes reconfiguring the SDK can help. Go to `Project Structure > Platform Settings > SDKs`, select the Python SDK, and ensure it has the correct paths set.\n\n8. **Update PyCharm and Plugins**:\n   - Ensure that you are using the latest version of PyCharm and that all plugins are up to date. Sometimes, updates fix bugs related to code completion.\n\nIf you've tried all of the above and the issue persists, consider checking the PyCharm support forums or filing a bug report with JetBrains, as it might be an IDE-specific issue."
