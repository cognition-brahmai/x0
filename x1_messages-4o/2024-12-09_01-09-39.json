The subprocess takes a long time to run and I want its stdout to be printed live to the screen in the Jupyter notebook. I can do this in a normal Python script run from the terminal using:\n\n```python\ndef run_command(cmd):\n    from subprocess import Popen, PIPE\n    import shlex\n\n    with Popen(shlex.split(cmd), stdout=PIPE, bufsize=1, universal_newlines=True) as p:\n        for line in p.stdout:\n            print(line, end='')\n        exit_code = p.poll()\n    return exit_code\n```\nHowever, when I run the script in a Jupyter notebook, it does not print the stdout live to the screen. Instead, it prints everything after the subprocess has finished running. How can I modify this to get a live stdout output in Jupyter notebook?"

        "content": "When you're running a script in a Jupyter notebook, the output buffering behavior can be different from running it directly in a terminal. To achieve live output in Jupyter, you can make use of the `IPython.display` module to explicitly flush the output after each line is printed. Here's how you can modify your function to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom subprocess import Popen, PIPE\nimport shlex\nfrom IPython.display import display, clear_output\n\ndef run_command(cmd):\n    with Popen(shlex.split(cmd), stdout=PIPE, bufsize=1, universal_newlines=True) as p:\n        for line in p.stdout:\n            print(line, end='')\n            display(line, display_id=True)\n        exit_code = p.poll()\n    return exit_code\n```\n\nIn this updated function:\n\n1. I've added `display(line, display_id=True)` to the loop to ensure that each line is immediately displayed in the Jupyter notebook.\n2. The `display_id=True` is a way to ensure that the output is updated in place, but depending on your specific needs, you might not need it. You can remove it if it doesn't fit your use case.\n3. The `print(line, end='')` statement still prints to the standard output, but in a Jupyter notebook, using `display` ensures that the notebook interface handles the output suitably.\n\nThis should help you get live updates of the subprocess's stdout in a Jupyter notebook."
