Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\noriginal_string = \"abcdefghij\"\nmodified_string = original_string[:-1]\nprint(modified_string)\n```\n\nIn this code, `original_string[:-1]` creates a new string that contains all characters of `original_string` except the last one. The `-1` index tells Python to exclude the last character from the slice. The output will be:\n\n```\nabcdefghi\n```\n\nThis method is efficient and works for any string length."
