        "content": "To determine how many different chemical compounds can be created using only the elements H (hydrogen), O (oxygen), C (carbon), and N (nitrogen) with the constraint that each compound must contain at least one element and cannot repeat elements, we need to consider the possible combinations of these elements.\n\nThe elements available are H, O, C, and N. We can form compounds by choosing any non-empty subset of these elements. The number of non-empty subsets of a set with \\( n \\) elements is \\( 2^n - 1 \\).\n\nFor our set of four elements (H, O, C, N), the total number of subsets, including the empty set, is:\n\n\\[ 2^4 = 16 \\]\n\nTo find the number of non-empty subsets, we subtract the empty set:\n\n\\[ 2^4 - 1 = 16 - 1 = 15 \\]\n\nThus, there are 15 different combinations of the elements H, O, C, and N where each combination represents a different potential chemical compound."
