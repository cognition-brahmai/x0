For example, if the input emotion is \"happiness\", the output should be a poem that evokes happiness. The poem should be at least 8 lines long and should include rhyming couplets. Thank you for your creativity!"

        "content": "Certainly! Here's a Python script that generates a poem based on a given emotion. We'll use a simple approach to create rhyming couplets and evoke the desired emotion. The script uses predefined word lists and phrases associated with different emotions.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef generate_poem(emotion):\n    # Word lists and phrases associated with different emotions\n    word_bank = {\n        \"happiness\": {\n            \"words\": [\"sunshine\", \"smile\", \"delight\", \"bright\", \"cheer\", \"light\", \"joy\", \"play\"],\n            \"phrases\": [\n                \"The sun shines in the sky so clear,\",\n                \"A smile on your face brings cheer.\",\n                \"Delight dances in the gentle breeze,\",\n                \"Happiness blooms like flowers and trees.\",\n                \"Laughter fills the air with glee,\",\n                \"Moments of joy are wild and free.\",\n                \"In the light of day, all worries fade,\",\n                \"A heart full of joy, unafraid.\"\n            ]\n        },\n        # You can add more emotions and their corresponding words and phrases here\n    }\n    \n    if emotion not in word_bank:\n        return \"Sorry, I don't have data for that emotion yet.\"\n    \n    # Select phrases for the poem\n    phrases = word_bank[emotion][\"phrases\"]\n    random.shuffle(phrases)\n    \n    # Create a poem with rhyming couplets\n    poem = []\n    for i in range(0, len(phrases), 2):\n        if i+1 < len(phrases):\n            poem.append(phrases[i])\n            poem.append(phrases[i+1])\n    \n    return \"\\n\".join(poem)\n\n# Example usage\nemotion = \"happiness\"\npoem = generate_poem(emotion)\nprint(f\"Poem for the emotion '{emotion}':\\n\")\nprint(poem)\n```\n\nThis script defines a word bank with words and phrases associated with the emotion \"happiness.\" You can expand this word bank with more emotions and corresponding words and phrases. The script shuffles the phrases and constructs a poem with rhyming couplets. You can adjust the phrases or add more complex logic to enhance the poetry generation."
