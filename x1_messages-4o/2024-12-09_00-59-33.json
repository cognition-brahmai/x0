I want the block to handle exceptions and retry the code block following certain exceptions. Is there a way to neatly package this into the context manager? Currently, I am handling this with a decorator but I would prefer to use the context manager so I can wrap a few lines of code in the `with` block instead of an inline function wrapped in a decorator. \n\nHere is what I'm aiming for:\n\n```python\ndef do_work():\n    ...\n    # This is ideal!\n    with transaction(retries=3):\n        # Atomic DB statements\n        ...\n    ...\n```\n\nThis is my current approach: \n\n```python\ndef do_work():\n    ...\n    # This is not ideal!\n    @transaction(retries=3)\n    def _perform_in_transaction():\n        # Atomic DB statements\n        ...\n    _perform_in_transaction()\n    ...\n```"

        "content": "To encapsulate logic for database transactions with retries into a `with` block, you can create a custom context manager using Python's `contextlib` module. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n```python\nimport contextlib\nimport time\n\nclass TransactionException(Exception):\n    \"\"\"Custom exception to handle transaction failures.\"\"\"\n    pass\n\n@contextlib.contextmanager\ndef transaction(retries=3, delay=1, backoff=2, exceptions=(TransactionException,)):\n    attempt = 0\n    while attempt < retries:\n        try:\n            # Begin transaction\n            print(\"Starting transaction\")\n            yield\n            # Commit transaction\n            print(\"Committing transaction\")\n            break\n        except exceptions as e:\n            # Handle exceptions and retry\n            print(f\"Transaction failed: {e}, retrying... ({attempt + 1}/{retries})\")\n            attempt += 1\n            time.sleep(delay)\n            delay *= backoff\n            if attempt == retries:\n                # Rollback transaction\n                print(\"Rolling back transaction\")\n                raise\n        else:\n            # If no exceptions, commit the transaction\n            print(\"Transaction successful\")\n            break\n\ndef do_work():\n    try:\n        with transaction(retries=3):\n            # Atomic DB statements\n            print(\"Performing database operations\")\n            # Simulate an exception\n            raise TransactionException(\"Simulated failure\")\n    except TransactionException:\n        print(\"Transaction ultimately failed after retries.\")\n\ndo_work()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`@contextlib.contextmanager`**: This decorator is used to define a generator function that makes it easy to create a context manager. It simplifies the setup and teardown logic using `yield`.\n\n- **Retry Logic**: The context manager has a loop to handle retries. It attempts to execute the block of code and if an exception is raised, it retries the block after a delay.\n\n- **Delay and Backoff**: The `delay` parameter is used to wait before retrying, and `backoff` is used to exponentially increase the delay time between retries.\n\n- **Exception Handling**: The context manager can catch specified exceptions and decide whether to retry or not. You can customize which exceptions should trigger a retry.\n\n- **Transaction Lifecycle**: Placeholders for starting, committing, and rolling back transactions are included. You'll want to replace these with your actual database transaction logic.\n\nThis structure allows you to encapsulate transaction logic with retry capabilities cleanly within a `with` block."
