        "content": "To format \"yesterday's\" date in the format MMDDYY in Python, you can use the `datetime` module to handle date manipulations. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Get today's date\ntoday = datetime.now()\n\n# Calculate yesterday's date\nyesterday = today - timedelta(days=1)\n\n# Format yesterday's date to MMDDYY\nformatted_date = yesterday.strftime('%m%d%y')\n\nprint(formatted_date)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what the code does:\n\n1. Import the necessary classes from the `datetime` module.\n2. Get today's date using `datetime.now()`.\n3. Calculate yesterday's date by subtracting one day (`timedelta(days=1)`) from today.\n4. Use the `strftime()` method to format the date as MMDDYY, where `%m` is the month, `%d` is the day, and `%y` is the last two digits of the year.\n5. Print the formatted date.\n\nThis script will give you the desired format for yesterday's date."
