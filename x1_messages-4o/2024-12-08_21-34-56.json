]alue showing the amount contributed to the fund.\n- `balance`: A decimal value displaying the current balance of the fund.\n\nFor the SQL query to retrieve the contribution amount and balance for each pension fund by fund type, you could use:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    fund_type, \n    SUM(contribution_amount) AS total_contribution, \n    SUM(balance) AS total_balance\nFROM \n    pension_funds\nGROUP BY \n    fund_type;\n```\n\nThis SQL query groups the data by `fund_type` and calculates the sum of `contribution_amount` and `balance` for each fund type. The result will provide you with the total contributions and balances for each type of pension fund."
