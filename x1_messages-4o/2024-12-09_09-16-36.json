        "content": "To generate a list of numbers from 0 to 10 that are divisible by 4 without any remainder, you can iterate through the numbers in that range and check if each number is divisible by 4. Here's a simple approach:\n\n1. Start with an empty list to store the numbers.\n2. Loop through numbers from 0 to 10.\n3. For each number, check if dividing the number by 4 gives a remainder of 0 (i.e., use the modulus operator `%`).\n4. If the remainder is 0, add the number to the list.\n5. Continue until the loop completes.\n\nFollowing this process, the numbers that are divisible by 4 in the range from 0 to 10 are 0, 4, and 8.\n\nHere's a sample code snippet in Python that demonstrates this:\n\n```python\ndivisible_by_4 = [number for number in range(0, 11) if number % 4 == 0]\nprint(divisible_by_4)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n[0, 4, 8]\n```"
