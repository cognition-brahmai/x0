        "content": "Why does the following Python code not work as expected? I am trying to use the ignorecase flag (re.I) in re.sub() function from the Python re module. The function should return a string that replaces the leftmost non-overlapping occurrences of the pattern in the string with the replacement. However, it doesn't seem to replace the word 'class' with 'function' in the string 'Class object', unless I change the pattern to 'Class'. The documentation doesn't mention any limitations about this, so I am assuming I may be doing something wrong. Here is my code:\n\n```python\nimport re\nprint re.sub('class', 'function', 'Class object', re.I)\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to how the `re.sub()` function is being called. In Python 2, which seems to be the version you're using given the `print` statement without parentheses, the `re.sub()` function requires the flags to be passed using the `flags` keyword argument. If you directly pass `re.I` as the fourth positional argument, it doesn't interpret it as flags correctly. \n\nHere's how you can modify your code to work as expected:\n\n```python\nimport re\nprint re.sub('class', 'function', 'Class object', flags=re.I)\n```\n\nBy specifying `flags=re.I`, you ensure that the ignore case flag is applied to the pattern matching.\n\nIf you are using Python 3, remember that the `print` function requires parentheses:\n\n```python\nimport re\nprint(re.sub('class', 'function', 'Class object', flags=re.I))\n```\n\nThis should correctly output `'function object'`, replacing 'Class' with 'function' regardless of the case."
