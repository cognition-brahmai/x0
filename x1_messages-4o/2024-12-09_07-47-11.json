The error seems to be flagging the second argument in my code, specifically the line beginning with `url(...)`. Here's a snippet of the code:\n\n```python\nurlpatterns = patterns('',\n    url(r'^$', listing, name='investment-listing'),\n)\n```\nI am considering disabling this check in Sublime Text 2 but I want to understand what I'm doing wrong before doing so. Could someone explain what PEP8's E128: continuation line under-indented for visual indent means and how to correct it in my code?"

        "content": "PEP8's E128 error refers to \"continuation line under-indented for visual indent.\" This means that when you break a line in your Python code and continue it on the next line, the continuation lines should be indented in a way that is visually aligned with the start of the line or the opening delimiter.\n\nIn your code snippet, the line starting with `url(...)` is not aligned correctly according to PEP8 guidelines. In PEP8, it's recommended to align continuation lines with the opening delimiter or to use an additional level of indentation to visually separate the continuation line from the rest of the code.\n\nYou can correct the E128 error in your code by ensuring that the continuation line is indented properly. Here's how you can adjust your code to comply with PEP8:\n\nOption 1: Align with the opening delimiter:\n\n```python\nurlpatterns = patterns('',\n                       url(r'^$', listing, name='investment-listing'),\n)\n```\n\nOption 2: Use an extra level of indentation:\n\n```python\nurlpatterns = patterns('',\n    url(r'^$', listing, name='investment-listing'),\n    )\n```\n\nEither of these options would resolve the E128 error. The first option aligns the `url` line with the opening delimiter of `patterns`, which is common in multi-line statements. The second option uses an extra level of indentation, which is also acceptable. Choose the style that best fits your project's code style guidelines or personal preference."
