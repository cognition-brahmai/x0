Where can I find the 'style' attribute in this version?"

        "content": "The `style` attribute in Matplotlib was introduced in version 1.4.0. Since you are using version 1.1.1, this feature is not available to you. To use the `style` attribute, you will need to upgrade your Matplotlib to at least version 1.4.0 or later.\n\nHere's how you can upgrade Matplotlib using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade matplotlib\n```\n\nAfter upgrading, you should be able to use the `style` attribute as you intended:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use('ggplot')\n```\n\nIf you encounter any issues during the upgrade process, ensure that your Python environment is properly configured and that you have the necessary permissions to install and upgrade packages."
