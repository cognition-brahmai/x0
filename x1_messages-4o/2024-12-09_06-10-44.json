I've written a lambda function, and after testing it, the console shows \"succeeded\", but I do not see any new files in my S3 bucket. I am not sure what is going wrong.

Here is the Python code I've been using:\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport boto3\n\ndef lambda_handler(event, context):\n\n    string = \"dfghj\"\n\n    file_name = \"hello.txt\"\n    lambda_path = \"/tmp/\" + file_name\n    s3_path = \"/100001/20180223/\" + file_name\n\n    with open(lambda_path, 'w+') as file:\n        file.write(string)\n        file.close()\n\n    s3 = boto3.resource('s3')\n    s3.meta.client.upload_file(lambda_path, 's3bucket', s3_path)\n```"

        "content": "When you're working with AWS Lambda to write files to an S3 bucket, there are several possible reasons why you might not see the expected files in your S3 bucket. Let's go through some common issues and solutions:\n\n1. **Permissions**:\n   - Ensure that your Lambda function has the necessary permissions to write to the S3 bucket. This requires an IAM role attached to the Lambda function with a policy that allows `s3:PutObject` permission for the target bucket.\n   - You can attach a policy like this to your Lambda execution role:\n\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n       \"Statement\": [\n         {\n           \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n           \"Action\": \"s3:PutObject\",\n           \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::s3bucket/100001/20180223/*\"\n         }\n       ]\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Bucket Name**:\n   - Double-check the bucket name 's3bucket' to ensure it is correct. Bucket names are case-sensitive and must match exactly.\n\n3. **S3 Path**:\n   - Verify the `s3_path` to ensure the directory structure `/100001/20180223/` exists or is correctly specified. S3 does not require directories to pre-exist, but ensure the path is intended.\n\n4. **Region Configuration**:\n   - Ensure that your Lambda function and S3 bucket are in the same AWS region or correctly configured to handle cross-region operations.\n\n5. **Lambda Execution**:\n   - Confirm that the Lambda function is successfully executing and no exceptions are being raised, especially related to the S3 upload.\n\n6. **AWS SDK Version**:\n   - Ensure that you're using a compatible version of the `boto3` library with AWS Lambda. AWS Lambda comes with a pre-installed version of `boto3`, which is usually sufficient.\n\n7. **Logging**:\n   - Add logging to your Lambda function to better understand what is happening during execution. You can use the `logging` module to output information to CloudWatch Logs:\n\n     ```python\n     import logging\n     import boto3\n     import os\n\n     logger = logging.getLogger()\n     logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)\n\n     def lambda_handler(event, context):\n\n         string = \"dfghj\"\n\n         file_name = \"hello.txt\"\n         lambda_path = \"/tmp/\" + file_name\n         s3_path = \"100001/20180223/\" + file_name  # No leading slash\n\n         logger.info(f\"Writing to: {lambda_path}\")\n         with open(lambda_path, 'w+') as file:\n             file.write(string)\n\n         s3 = boto3.resource('s3')\n         bucket_name = 's3bucket'\n         logger.info(f\"Uploading {lambda_path} to s3://{bucket_name}/{s3_path}\")\n         s3.meta.client.upload_file(lambda_path, bucket_name, s3_path)\n         logger.info(\"Upload complete\")\n     ```\n\n8. **Check S3 Bucket**:\n   - After the execution, check the S3 bucket manually to see if the file is there. Sometimes console views might not refresh automatically.\n\nBy addressing the above points, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the issue with your Lambda function not writing files to the S3 bucket."
