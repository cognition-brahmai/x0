I am looking for a solution that returns an array of years, something like this:\n\n```python\nyears = f(dates)\n#output:\narray([2010, 2011, 2012], dtype=int8) #or dtype = string\n```"

        "content": "In NumPy version 1.6.2, datetime64 arrays don't directly support vectorized operations like extracting years. However, a common workaround is to use the `astype` method to convert the `datetime64` array to a string array, and then slice the strings to get the year. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Assuming dates is your datetime64 array\ndates = np.array(['2010-10-17', '2011-05-13', '2012-01-15'], dtype='datetime64')\n\n# Convert datetime64 to string and extract year\nyears_str = dates.astype('datetime64[Y]').astype(str)\n\n# Convert the string years to integers if needed\nyears = years_str.astype(int)\n\nprint(years)\n```\n\nThis code first converts the `datetime64` array to a `datetime64` with just the year precision using `astype('datetime64[Y]')`, then to a string array, and finally to integers. This approach does not involve explicit Python loops and uses NumPy's vectorized operations."
