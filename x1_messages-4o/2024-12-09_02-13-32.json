I understand that Gmail requires authentication before it delivers any mail, but I am curious how mail from another SMTP server gets delivered since they don't have Gmail credentials. I ran a Python script for this, but I received an \"Authentication Required\" error. How do external SMTP servers avoid this problem? Can this be replicated in a local script or does it require correct reverse DNS records, SPF records, etc? Here is the Python script and the error message:\n\n```python\nimport smtplib\nimport email\nmsg = email.message.Message()\nmsg[\"From\"] = \"user@gmail.com\"\nmsg[\"To\"] = \"user@gmail.com\"\nmsg[\"Subject\"] = \"Test message\"\nserver = smtplib.SMTP(\"smtp.gmail.com\",587)\nserver.starttls()\nserver.ehlo_or_helo_if_needed()\ntry:\n    failed = server.sendmail(\"user@gmail.com\",\"user@gmail.com\", msg.as_string())\n    server.close()\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(e)\n```\n\nError:\n```\n(530, b'5.5.1 Authentication Required.

        "content": "To send an email from a script without embedding your Gmail password, you would typically use an approach that leverages OAuth2, which allows you to authenticate without directly using your password. Here's a brief breakdown of how external SMTP servers deliver mail and how you can replicate it in a local script:\n\n### How External SMTP Servers Deliver Mail:\n\n1. **Trust and Reputation**: External SMTP servers build a reputation over time and are managed by organizations that maintain proper email sending practices. They have a trusted relationship with recipient mail servers.\n\n2. **Correct DNS Setup**: These servers have properly configured DNS records, such as SPF (Sender Policy Framework), DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail), and DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance), which help in authenticating the sender's domain.\n\n3. **Reverse DNS Records**: They also have reverse DNS records set up, which help verify the sending server's identity.\n\n4. **No Authentication Needed**: Trusted external SMTP servers don't need to authenticate like individual users because they communicate directly between mail servers, which use public DNS records to verify legitimacy.\n\n### Replicating in a Local Script:\n\nTo replicate this without using your password, you can use OAuth2 for authentication. Here\u2019s a simplified version of how you would do that:\n\n1. **Set Up OAuth2 Credentials**:\n   - Go to the Google Cloud Console.\n   - Create a new project.\n   - Enable the Gmail API for this project.\n   - Create OAuth2 credentials (a client ID and client secret).\n\n2. **Install Required Libraries**:\n   - Use `pip` to install `google-auth` and `google-auth-oauthlib`.\n\n3. **Use OAuth2 in Your Script**:\n   Here's an example of how you would modify your script to use OAuth2:\n\n   ```python\n   import base64\n   import google.auth\n   from google.auth.transport.requests import Request\n   from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow\n   from google.auth.transport.requests import Request\n   import google.auth.transport.requests\n   import smtplib\n   from email.mime.text import MIMEText\n\n   # Scopes required for the Gmail API\n   SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send']\n\n   # Load credentials\n   flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file(\n       'credentials.json', SCOPES)\n   creds = flow.run_local_server(port=0)\n\n   # Create the email\n   email_msg = \"This is a test message\"\n   mime_message = MIMEText(email_msg)\n   mime_message['to'] = \"user@gmail.com\"\n   mime_message['subject'] = 'Test message'\n\n   # Connect to Gmail SMTP server\n   try:\n       smtp_conn = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)\n       smtp_conn.ehlo()\n       smtp_conn.starttls()\n       smtp_conn.ehlo()\n\n       # Authenticate using OAuth2\n       auth_string = 'user=%s\\1auth=Bearer %s\\1\\1' % (creds.token)\n       smtp_conn.docmd('AUTH', 'XOAUTH2 ' + base64.b64encode(auth_string.encode()).decode())\n\n       smtp_conn.sendmail(\"user@gmail.com\", \"user@gmail.com\", mime_message.as_string())\n       smtp_conn.quit()\n   except Exception as e:\n       print(e)\n   ```\n\n4. **Run the Script**:\n   - This will open a browser for you to authenticate with your Google account, and then it will send the email using OAuth2.\n\n### Note:\n- Ensure you have a correct `credentials.json` file obtained from the Google Cloud Console.\n- This code is a simplified example and may require additional error handling and configuration based on your specific needs.\n\nUsing OAuth2 is a secure way to send emails programmatically without exposing your Gmail password."
