Assuming you have a table named `customers` with columns `age` and `gender`, you would use the following SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(age) AS average_age\nFROM customers\nWHERE gender = 'female';\n```\n\nThis query selects the average of the `age` column for rows where the `gender` column is 'female'. The result will give you the average age of all female customers in your database. Make sure to replace `customers`, `age`, and `gender` with the actual table and column names used in your database schema."
