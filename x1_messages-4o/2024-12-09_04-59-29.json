I am trying to change the label of a field, specifically the 'email' field that was defined in one of the parent forms, within my form `RegistrationFormTOS`. I am trying to do this in my `__init__` method, but it throws an error saying that \"'RegistrationFormTOS' object has no attribute 'email'\". How can I change the label of the 'email' field in my Django form?\n\nHere is my form code:\n\n```python\nfrom django import forms\nfrom django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _\nfrom registration.forms import RegistrationFormUniqueEmail\nfrom registration.forms import RegistrationFormTermsOfService\n\nattrs_dict = { 'class': 'required' }\n\nclass RegistrationFormTOS(RegistrationFormUniqueEmail, RegistrationFormTermsOfService):\n    \"\"\"\n    Subclass of ``RegistrationForm`` which adds a required checkbox\n    for agreeing to a site's Terms of Service.\n\n    \"\"\"\n    email2 = forms.EmailField(widget=forms.TextInput(attrs=dict(attrs_dict, maxlength=75)), label=_(u'verify email address'))\n\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        self.email.label = \"New Email Label\"\n        super(RegistrationFormTOS, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n\n    def clean_email2(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Verifiy that the values entered into the two email fields\n        match. \n        \"\"\"\n        if 'email' in self.cleaned_data and 'email2' in self.cleaned_data:\n            if self.cleaned_data['email'] != self.cleaned_data['email2']:\n                raise forms.ValidationError(_(u'You must type the same email each time'))\n        return self.cleaned_data\n```"

        "content": "In Django forms, fields are stored in the `self.fields` dictionary, not as attributes on the form instance itself. Therefore, to change the label of an existing field, you should access it through `self.fields`. Here's how you can modify your `__init__` method to change the label of the 'email' field:\n\n```python\nfrom django import forms\nfrom django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _\nfrom registration.forms import RegistrationFormUniqueEmail\nfrom registration.forms import RegistrationFormTermsOfService\n\nattrs_dict = {'class': 'required'}\n\nclass RegistrationFormTOS(RegistrationFormUniqueEmail, RegistrationFormTermsOfService):\n    \"\"\"\n    Subclass of ``RegistrationForm`` which adds a required checkbox\n    for agreeing to a site's Terms of Service.\n    \"\"\"\n    email2 = forms.EmailField(widget=forms.TextInput(attrs=dict(attrs_dict, maxlength=75)), label=_(u'verify email address'))\n\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super(RegistrationFormTOS, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n        # Modify the label of the 'email' field\n        if 'email' in self.fields:\n            self.fields['email'].label = \"New Email Label\"\n\n    def clean_email2(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Verify that the values entered into the two email fields\n        match. \n        \"\"\"\n        if 'email' in self.cleaned_data and 'email2' in self.cleaned_data:\n            if self.cleaned_data['email'] != self.cleaned_data['email2']:\n                raise forms.ValidationError(_(u'You must type the same email each time'))\n        return self.cleaned_data\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Accessing Fields:** Access the fields through the `self.fields` dictionary. So, `self.fields['email']` gives you access to the 'email' field.\n\n2. **Place `super()` Call First:** Make sure to call `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)` before trying to modify any fields. This ensures that the fields from the parent classes are properly initialized before you try to modify them.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to change the label of the 'email' field without encountering the error you described."
