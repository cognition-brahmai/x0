Currently, I am using list comprehension as shown below:\n\n```python\nuser_list = [user for user in user_iterator]\n```\nI am interested in knowing if there's a faster, better or more correct way to achieve this."

However, there is an even more straightforward and efficient way to achieve this using the `list()` constructor. This method is generally faster and more readable, as it is specifically designed for this purpose:\n\n```python\nuser_list = list(user_iterator)\n```\n\nUsing the `list()` constructor directly on the iterator is typically the best practice because it is clear, concise, and optimal for converting any iterable, including iterators, into a list. This approach benefits from being both efficient and easy to understand, making it the preferred method in most cases."
