Can you help me understand if I've imported the wrong version of Keras and TensorFlow?

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is likely due to a mismatch between the versions of TensorFlow and Keras you are using. TensorFlow 2.x incorporates Keras as its high-level API, and these versions must be compatible to work together seamlessly. Here are some steps and suggestions to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Version Compatibility**:\n   - TensorFlow 2.2 works best with the integrated version of Keras. There's no need to install a separate Keras package because TensorFlow includes it.\n   - Use the Keras interface provided by TensorFlow instead: `from tensorflow import keras`.\n\n2. **Package Installations**:\n   - Remove the separate installation of Keras. TensorFlow 2.x includes Keras by default, and using `keras==2.3.1` is not necessary.\n   - Ensure you reinstall TensorFlow to refresh the environment: `!pip install tensorflow==2.2`.\n   - Avoid installing a separate Keras library: `!pip uninstall keras`.\n\n3. **Correct Import Statements**:\n   - Replace `import Keras` with `from tensorflow import keras`.\n   - Ensure that all other imports are correctly capitalized: `import numpy as np` instead of `import NumPy as np`.\n\n4. **Segmentation Models Library**:\n   - Make sure the segmentation models library is compatible with the TensorFlow version you are using. Check the library's documentation or repository for compatibility notes.\n\n5. **Confirm the Environment**:\n   - If you are using a Jupyter notebook or Google Colab, restart the runtime after making these changes to ensure the environment is clean and no old libraries are loaded.\n\nHere's a revised version of your code snippet with some adjustments:\n\n```python\n# Install required libs  \n!pip install -U segmentation-models\n!pip install tensorflow==2.2\n\n## Imports libs\nimport os\nos.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '0'\n\nimport cv2\nfrom tensorflow import keras\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the import issues and run your code successfully. Adjust any other dependencies or segments as necessary, based on the output or errors you encounter."
