Python doesn't provide left/right versions of its comparison operators, so how does it determine which function to call? Given the following classes A and B, both of which have an __eq__ method:\n\n```python\nclass A(object):\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        print \"A __eq__ called\"\n        return self.value == other\nclass B(object):\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        print \"B __eq__ called\"\n        return self.value == other\n\na = A()\na.value = 3\nb = B()\nb.value = 4\nprint(a == b)\n```\n\nThis seems to call both __eq__ functions. I am interested in understanding the official decision tree for this."

        "content": "In Python, when you use the equality operator `==` between two objects, Python internally calls the `__eq__` method to determine if they are equal. The process of determining which `__eq__` method to call is part of what's known as operator overloading and involves a specific decision tree. Here's how it generally works:\n\n1. **Check the Left Operand's `__eq__` Method**: First, Python attempts to call the `__eq__` method of the left operand. In your example, `print(a == b)` will first call `A.__eq__(a, b)`.\n\n2. **Check the Right Operand's `__eq__` Method (if necessary)**: If the `__eq__` method of the left operand returns `NotImplemented`, Python then attempts to call the `__eq__` method of the right operand. So, if `A.__eq__` had returned `NotImplemented`, Python would try `B.__eq__(b, a)`.\n\n3. **Fallback to Identity Comparison**: If neither object knows how to compare with the other (i.e., both return `NotImplemented`), Python falls back to comparing the identities of the objects using `is`, which checks if both operands refer to the same object in memory.\n\nIn your specific example, since both classes `A` and `B` provide their own `__eq__` methods, Python will first call `A.__eq__` and print \"A __eq__ called\". It won't proceed to call `B.__eq__` because `A.__eq__` doesn't return `NotImplemented`.\n\nOne thing to note here is that your `__eq__` methods aren't directly comparable with each other, as they expect the `other` parameter to be comparable to `self.value`. If you want to ensure that both methods are checked, you'd need to handle the situation where `A.__eq__` returns `NotImplemented` explicitly.\n\nHere's an example modification that illustrates this behavior:\n\n```python\nclass A(object):\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        print(\"A __eq__ called\")\n        if isinstance(other, B):\n            return NotImplemented\n        return self.value == other\n\nclass B(object):\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        print(\"B __eq__ called\")\n        if isinstance(other, A):\n            return NotImplemented\n        return self.value == other\n\na = A()\na.value = 3\nb = B()\nb.value = 4\n\nprint(a == b)  # Calls A.__eq__, which returns NotImplemented, so calls B.__eq__\n```\n\nThis modification ensures that if `A.__eq__` is not suitable for handling the comparison, it returns `NotImplemented`, allowing Python to try `B.__eq__` as a fallback."
