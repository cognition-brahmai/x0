I tried renaming the folder from 'vnev' to 'venv' using the command `$ mv vnev venv` and then activated it using `$ . venv/bin/activate`. However, the name of the active environment still remains as 'vnev'. How can I properly rename this environment?"

        "content": "Renaming a virtual environment in Python is not as straightforward as just renaming the directory because the environment's metadata retains the original name. Here's a step-by-step guide to properly renaming your virtual environment:\n\n1. **Deactivate the Current Environment:**\n   First, if your virtual environment is active, deactivate it by running:\n   ```bash\n   deactivate\n   ```\n\n2. **Rename the Directory:**\n   You've already done this step, but just to reiterate, rename the directory from `vnev` to `venv`:\n   ```bash\n   mv vnev venv\n   ```\n\n3. **Update the Environment's Metadata:**\n   The environment name you see when you activate it is stored in the `prompt` section of the `pyvenv.cfg` file located inside the virtual environment directory. You can manually update it by editing this file:\n\n   - Open `venv/pyvenv.cfg` using a text editor:\n     ```bash\n     nano venv/pyvenv.cfg\n     ```\n\n   - Look for a line starting with `prompt =` and update it to:\n     ```plaintext\n     prompt = venv\n     ```\n\n4. **Reactivate the Environment:**\n   Now activate your virtual environment again:\n   ```bash\n   source venv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\nAfter these steps, your virtual environment should display the new name `venv` when activated. If you encounter any issues, consider recreating the virtual environment with the correct name and reinstalling the necessary packages, as this ensures all references are updated correctly."
