        "content": "The 2020 U.S. Presidential election, held on November 3, was a significant political event characterized by a high voter turnout and the widespread use of mail-in ballots due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The election saw Democratic candidate Joe Biden defeat the incumbent Republican President Donald Trump, securing 306 electoral votes to Trump's 232. Joe Biden's campaign focused on national unity, healthcare, and managing the pandemic, while Donald Trump's campaign emphasized economic recovery and immigration policies. The election was marked by contentious debates, legal challenges, and accusations of voter fraud, which were largely dismissed by courts. Biden's victory led to Kamala Harris becoming the first female, Black, and South Asian Vice President in U.S. history."
