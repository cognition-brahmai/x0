This method handles the potential race condition where the file might be deleted by another process between the `os.path.exists()` check and the `os.remove()` call. You can use:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ntry:\n    os.remove(filename)\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    pass\n```\n\nThis approach attempts to remove the file directly and only handles the `FileNotFoundError`, which occurs if the file does not exist. It is concise and avoids unnecessary checks."
