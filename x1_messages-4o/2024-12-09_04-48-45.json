However, when I print the DataFrame after performing the operation, the commas and dollar signs are still present. Is there a different method to remove these characters using pandas? The code that I am currently using is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport pandas_datareader.data as web\n\nplayers = pd.read_html('http://www.usatoday.com/sports/mlb/salaries/2013/player/p/')\n\ndf1 = pd.DataFrame(players[0])\n\ndf1.drop(df1.columns[[0,3,4, 5, 6]], axis=1, inplace=True)\ndf1.columns = ['Player', 'Team', 'Avg_Annual']\ndf1['Avg_Annual'] = df1['Avg_Annual'].replace(',', '')\n\nprint (df1.head(10))\n```"

        "content": "It looks like you're trying to remove commas and dollar signs from the 'Avg_Annual' column in your DataFrame, but the `replace` method is not being used correctly. When using `replace`, you need to specify a dictionary to indicate which characters should be replaced and their replacements. Additionally, you can chain the `replace` method to remove both commas and dollar signs, and convert the column to a numeric type. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Reading the data\nplayers = pd.read_html('http://www.usatoday.com/sports/mlb/salaries/2013/player/p/')\n\ndf1 = pd.DataFrame(players[0])\n\n# Dropping unnecessary columns\ndf1.drop(df1.columns[[0,3,4,5,6]], axis=1, inplace=True)\ndf1.columns = ['Player', 'Team', 'Avg_Annual']\n\n# Removing commas and dollar signs, and converting the column to a numeric type\ndf1['Avg_Annual'] = df1['Avg_Annual'].replace({'\\$': '', ',': ''}, regex=True).astype(float)\n\nprint(df1.head(10))\n```\n\nIn this code, `replace({'\\$': '', ',': ''}, regex=True)` is used to replace both dollar signs and commas with an empty string. The `regex=True` argument allows the method to interpret the replacement patterns as regular expressions. Finally, `astype(float)` is used to convert the cleaned strings to numeric values."
