        "content": "It looks like you're trying to set the limits of the y-axis using `plt.ylim()`, but you mentioned that the limits are being set from 20 to 200 instead of 25 to 250. Here are a few things you can check to ensure that the y-axis limits are set correctly:\n\n1. **Check the `ylim` function call:**\n   Make sure that the `plt.ylim()` function is called after plotting the data. In your provided code, it seems to be correctly placed, but double-check your actual code to ensure there are no unintended calls or overrides later on.\n\n2. **Check for any other calls that could override `ylim`:**\n   Verify that there are no additional calls to `plt.ylim()` or equivalent functions that might be overriding the limits after you set them.\n\n3. **Check for data or scaling issues:**\n   Ensure that the data being plotted (`plotDataPrice[0]`) does not contain any values that might cause auto-scaling to take precedence. However, since you are explicitly setting the limits, this should not typically be an issue.\n\n4. **Verify that `plt.subplot()` is not affecting the limits:**\n   The `plt.subplot()` function should not affect axis limits directly, but ensure that the `axisbg` parameter is correctly spelled as `facecolor` if you are using a more recent version of Matplotlib. The `axisbg` parameter was deprecated in favor of `facecolor`.\n\n5. **Inspect for any warnings or errors:**\n   Run the code and observe if there are any warnings or errors that might indicate why the limits are not being set as expected.\n\nHere's a refined version of your code with a minor correction on the `axisbg` parameter if you're using a newer version of Matplotlib:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nplt.figure(1, figsize=(8.5, 11))\nplt.suptitle('plot title')\nax = []\naPlot = plt.subplot(321, facecolor='w', title=\"Year 1\")\nax.append(aPlot)\nplt.plot(paramValues, plotDataPrice[0], color='#340B8C', \n         marker='o', ms=5, mfc='#EB1717')\nplt.xticks(paramValues)\nplt.ylabel('Average Price')\nplt.xlabel('Mark-up')\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.ylim((25, 250))\n```\n\nTry running this version and see if it resolves the issue. If the problem persists, please provide more context or data so I can investigate further."
