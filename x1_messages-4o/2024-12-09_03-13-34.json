Why is VS Code not recognizing the installed module?\n\n<pre><code>\nException has occurred: ModuleNotFoundError\nNo module named 'SimpleITK'\n  File \"C:\\Users\\Mido\\Desktop\\ProstateX-project\\src\\01-preprocessing\\03_resample_nifti.py\", line 8, in &lt;module&gt;\n    import SimpleITK as sitk\n</code></pre>"

        "content": "The `ModuleNotFoundError` you're encountering in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) despite having installed `SimpleITK` is likely due to a mismatch between the Python environment in which you're running your code and the environment in which the module is installed. Here are some steps to help resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify the Python Environment in VS Code**:\n   - Open your project in VS Code.\n   - Click on the Python version displayed at the bottom left corner of the window. This will show you the list of available Python environments.\n   - Ensure that the environment selected here is the same one where you installed `SimpleITK`. You can select the correct interpreter by clicking on it.\n\n2. **Check Installation in the Correct Environment**:\n   - Open a terminal in VS Code.\n   - Run the following command to verify that `SimpleITK` is installed in the active environment:\n     ```bash\n     pip show SimpleITK\n     ```\n   - If it's not found, you may need to reinstall it using the terminal in VS Code:\n     ```bash\n     pip install SimpleITK\n     ```\n\n3. **Using Virtual Environments**:\n   - Consider using a virtual environment to manage your dependencies. This ensures that all the modules are installed within the specific environment you're working in.\n   - You can create a virtual environment using the following commands:\n     ```bash\n     python -m venv myenv\n     source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `myenv\\Scripts\\activate`\n     pip install SimpleITK\n     ```\n   - Make sure to activate this environment in VS Code.\n\n4. **Reload VS Code**:\n   - Sometimes, simply reloading the window in VS Code can help it recognize changes in the environment. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P`, typing \"Reload Window\", and pressing Enter.\n\n5. **Check System Path**:\n   - Ensure that the path to the Python interpreter is correctly set in VS Code. You can check this by opening the Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P`) and typing \"Python: Select Interpreter\".\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to ensure that VS Code recognizes the installed `SimpleITK` module and resolves the `ModuleNotFoundError`."
