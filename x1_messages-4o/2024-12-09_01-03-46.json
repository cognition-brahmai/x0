        "content": "I am using IPython's parallel environment to execute a function multiple times with different parameters. The function takes in multiple parameters, and I would like to map only one of them over a list of values. The function is defined as follows:\n\n```python\ndef func(a,b):\n   ...\n```\nI want to evaluate this function on one value of 'a' and multiple values of 'b'. The normal way I would do this is by using the following code:\n```python\n[func(myA, b) for b in myLongList]\n```\nBut when I try to use map, @dview.parallel, etc., these map over all the arguments, not just the one I want. I tried using functools.partial and lambda expressions to solve this issue, but the lambda expression doesn't work correctly on remote machines, as the value of 'myA' is not included when the lambda expression is pickled. \n\nI've thought of two solutions. One is to manually construct lists for every argument and have map work over all of them, like this:\n```python\ndview.map_sync(func, [myA]*len(myLongList), myLongList)   \n```\nAnother solution is to use the data as default arguments to a function, forcing it to get pickled:\n```python\ndef parallelFunc(b, myA = myA):\n    return func(myA, b)\n\ndview.map_sync(parallelFunc, myLongList)\n```\nBoth of these solutions seem overly complicated, especially when the function takes a lot of parameters. Is there an idiomatic way to handle this situation in IPython's parallel environment? Something like a 'mapOver' attribute that allows me to specify which parameter I want to map over?"

        "content": "In IPython's parallel environment, there's no built-in feature like a 'mapOver' attribute to specify which parameter to map over directly. However, you can simplify your approach by creating a wrapper function that takes care of the parameter mapping, reducing the complexity in your code. Here's a more idiomatic way to handle this using a wrapper function:\n\n1. **Define a Wrapper Function**: Create a wrapper function that takes only the parameters you want to map over and internally calls your original function with the fixed parameters.\n\n2. **Use IPython's Parallel Tools**: Use the `map_sync` or `map_async` methods from IPython's parallel tools to distribute the computation.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom ipyparallel import Client\n\n# Define your original function\ndef func(a, b):\n    # Your function logic here\n    return a + b  # Example logic\n\n# Define a wrapper function\ndef wrapper_func(b):\n    # Fixed parameter 'a'\n    myA = 10  # Example fixed value\n    return func(myA, b)\n\n# Connect to the IPython parallel client\nrc = Client()\ndview = rc[:]\n\n# Use map_sync to distribute the computation\nresults = dview.map_sync(wrapper_func, myLongList)\n\n# Now 'results' contains the output of the function evaluated over myLongList\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Wrapper Function**: `wrapper_func` only takes the parameter you want to map over (`b` in this case) and calls the original function with a fixed `a`. This way, you avoid having to manually construct lists for each parameter or use default arguments.\n\n- **Parallel Execution**: The `map_sync` function distributes the `wrapper_func` execution across the available engines, each time passing a different value from `myLongList` for `b`.\n\nThis method keeps your code clean and leverages IPython's parallel computing capabilities effectively without requiring complex workarounds or modifications to your original function."
