Please create a summary table that includes the date, product name, quantity sold, and total revenue for the past month. However, to make it more interesting, can you sort the table in descending order based on the total revenue? Additionally, please include a chart that shows the trend in sales for each product over the past month. To further test your puzzle-solving skills, can you use a color-coding scheme to represent the sales performance of each product? We appreciate your efforts in making this task more challenging and fun. The data can be accessed through the following code: =IMPORTDATA(\"https://example.com/sales_data.csv\")"

        "content": "I'm glad you're interested in analyzing your sales data in a unique and challenging way! Since I can't access external data directly or run code, I'll guide you through the process of creating your summary table and chart based on a typical workflow using tools like Google Sheets or Excel.\n\n### Step 1: Importing Data\n1. Open Google Sheets or Excel.\n2. Use the `=IMPORTDATA(\"https://example.com/sales_data.csv\")` formula in Google Sheets to import your CSV data. In Excel, use the \"Get External Data\" feature to import the CSV file.\n\n### Step 2: Creating the Summary Table\n1. **Data Preparation:**\n   - Ensure your data includes columns for Date, Product Name, Quantity Sold, and Unit Price.\n   - Add a new column for Total Revenue: `=Quantity Sold * Unit Price`.\n\n2. **Summary Table:**\n   - Create a pivot table:\n     - Rows: Product Name\n     - Values: Sum of Quantity Sold and Sum of Total Revenue\n   - Add a Date filter to select the past month.\n\n3. **Sorting:**\n   - Sort the pivot table by Total Revenue in descending order.\n\n### Step 3: Creating the Sales Trend Chart\n1. **Insert a Line Chart:**\n   - Use the original data to create a line chart.\n   - Set the Date as the x-axis.\n   - Add Product Name as a series with Quantity Sold as the y-axis.\n\n2. **Customize the Chart:**\n   - Format lines for each product for clear differentiation.\n   - Add titles and labels for better understanding.\n\n### Step 4: Applying Color-Coding\n1. **Color-Coding Scheme:**\n   - Use conditional formatting based on sales performance.\n   - For example:\n     - Green for products with more than a 20% increase in sales.\n     - Yellow for products with stable sales.\n     - Red for products with a decline in sales.\n\n2. **Applying Conditional Formatting:**\n   - Highlight the cells in the Quantity Sold column.\n   - Apply rules based on percentage change compared to the previous period.\n\n### Visualization:\n- The summary table will give a quick overview of the top-performing products in terms of revenue.\n- The line chart will visually represent the sales trend of each product over the past month, with color-coding enhancing the visual impact by highlighting performance changes.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll have a comprehensive and visually appealing analysis of your sales data that is both challenging and fun to create and interpret. Enjoy exploring your store's performance!"
