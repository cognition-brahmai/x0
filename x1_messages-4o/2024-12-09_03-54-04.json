I have a numpy array, for example: \n\n```python\na = array([[1,11], [3,9], [5,7]]\n```\nI need to find the minimum value of each column, which in this case are 1 and 7, and then subtract these minimum values from their respective columns. The result should be:\n\n```python\na = array([[0,4], [2,2], [4,0]]\n```\nCould anyone help me with a snippet of code to do this?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this by using NumPy's vectorized operations. Here's a snippet of code that will do what you described:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Your original array\na = np.array([[1, 11], [3, 9], [5, 7]])\n\n# Find the minimum value of each column\nmin_values = np.min(a, axis=0)\n\n# Subtract the minimum values from their respective columns\nresult = a - min_values\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n\n```\n[[0 4]\n [2 2]\n [4 0]]\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `np.min(a, axis=0)` computes the minimum value along each column.\n- `a - min_values` subtracts the minimum values from each column, resulting in the desired transformation."
