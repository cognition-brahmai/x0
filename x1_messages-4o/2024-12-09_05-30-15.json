For example, if my lists became:\n\n```python\na = [\"Adele\", 'Spears', \"Nicole\", \"Cristina\", \"NDubz\"]\nb = [2,1,4,5,3]\n```\n\nYou can see that the order is maintained between the two lists. I know that I can shuffle one list using:\n\n```python\nimport random\nrandom.shuffle(a)\n```\n\nBut this only randomizes list 'a'. I would like to randomize list 'a' and maintain the same random order in list 'b'. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To randomize the lists while maintaining the corresponding order, you can zip the lists together, shuffle the combined list, and then unzip them back into the two separate lists. This way, the elements in both lists will maintain their relative positions. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\na = ['Spears', \"Adele\", \"NDubz\", \"Nicole\", \"Cristina\"]\nb = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# Combine the lists into a list of tuples\ncombined = list(zip(a, b))\n\n# Shuffle the combined list\nrandom.shuffle(combined)\n\n# Unzip the combined list back into two lists\na_shuffled, b_shuffled = zip(*combined)\n\n# Convert the tuples back into lists\na_shuffled = list(a_shuffled)\nb_shuffled = list(b_shuffled)\n\nprint(\"Shuffled a:\", a_shuffled)\nprint(\"Shuffled b:\", b_shuffled)\n```\n\nThis code will randomize the order of the elements in both lists `a` and `b` while ensuring that they maintain the same relative order between them."
