However, when I use IDLE and try to import NLTK, it gives me an error saying 'No module named nltk'. It seems the module has been installed in another python version (2.6), but I want to install it in Python 2.7. I tried to set PYTHONPATH to the python 2.7 site-packages and then installed NLTK again with 'sudo pip install -U nltk', but it still tries to install the package in 2.6. Here's the error message I receive:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<pyshell#0>\", line 1, in <module>\n    import nltk\nImportError: No module named nltk\n```\nand the message I receive after trying to reinstall NLTK is: 'Requirement already up-to-date in /Library/Python/2.6/'. I am not sure what I am doing wrong. Any suggestions?"

        "content": "It looks like your system is defaulting to Python 2.6 when you try to install NLTK with pip. To resolve this issue and ensure that NLTK is installed for Python 2.7, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Verify Python 2.7 Installation:**\n   First, ensure that Python 2.7 is properly installed on your system. You can check this by running:\n   ```bash\n   python2.7 --version\n   ```\n\n2. **Use Python 2.7's pip:**\n   Ensure that you are using the pip associated with Python 2.7. You can do this by explicitly calling `pip` for Python 2.7. If `pip2.7` is available, you can use:\n   ```bash\n   sudo pip2.7 install -U nltk\n   ```\n   If `pip2.7` is not available, you can use the following command to use Python 2.7's pip:\n   ```bash\n   python2.7 -m pip install -U nltk\n   ```\n\n3. **Check Python 2.7 Site-Packages:**\n   To verify that NLTK is installed for Python 2.7, navigate to the site-packages directory for Python 2.7 and check if NLTK is present:\n   ```bash\n   ls /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/\n   ```\n\n4. **Update PYTHONPATH:**\n   If the above steps do not resolve the issue, ensure that your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable includes the path to Python 2.7's site-packages. You can add the following line to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`):\n   ```bash\n   export PYTHONPATH=\"/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH\"\n   ```\n   Then, reload the shell configuration:\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bash_profile\n   ```\n\n5. **Install NLTK using Virtual Environment:**\n   Alternatively, you can create a virtual environment for Python 2.7 and install NLTK there:\n   ```bash\n   python2.7 -m virtualenv nltk_env\n   source nltk_env/bin/activate\n   pip install -U nltk\n   ```\n   This approach keeps your Python environment isolated and avoids conflicts with system-wide installations.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to install NLTK for Python 2.7 on your Mac and import it without issues in IDLE or any other Python environment."
