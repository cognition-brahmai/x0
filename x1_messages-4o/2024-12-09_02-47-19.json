Although the token used for authorization seems to be working fine in tests, I'm encountering an error stating \"not a valid key=value pair (missing equal-sign) in Authorization header\" when I try to POST to the API Gateway. My Python code to generate headers is provided below, and I'm also specifying the data while making the POST request. Despite changing the 'Content-type' header to 'Accept' and modifying my URL, the error persists and the intended file does not appear in the S3 bucket. How can I resolve this issue?\n\n```python\nheaders = {\n    \"Authorization\": \"Bearer \" + token,\n    \"Content-type\": \"application/json\"\n}\n\nresponse = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data={\"id\":\"0678a93d-ee8c-4db5-a831-1e311be4f04b\", \"test\":\"12345\"})\nprint(response.text)\n```\n\nError message: \"{\"message\":\"'{My Token}' not a valid key=value pair (missing equal-sign) in Authorization header: 'Bearer {My Token}'.\"}\n\nURL: https://my-api-gateway.amazonaws.com/MyStage"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering indicates a problem with the format of your `Authorization` header. Specifically, the error suggests that the header is not being interpreted correctly by the API Gateway, possibly due to how the token is being read or formatted. Here are some steps to help you troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Token Value**: Ensure that the `token` variable contains the correct token and does not have any leading or trailing spaces. You can add a print statement to verify this:\n   ```python\n   print(f\"Token: '{token}'\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Escape Characters**: Sometimes, special characters in the token might need to be URL-encoded. Although this is less common for a JWT token, it\u2019s worth checking if any characters are causing issues.\n\n3. **Verify Authorization Header**: Double-check that the `Authorization` header is correctly constructed. The spacing and format should be exactly as follows:\n   ```python\n   headers = {\n       \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {token}\",\n       \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Use JSON for Data**: When you specify `Content-Type: application/json`, the `data` should be in JSON format. Use the `json` parameter in the `requests.post` method instead of `data`:\n   ```python\n   import json\n\n   response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json={\"id\":\"0678a93d-ee8c-4db5-a831-1e311be4f04b\", \"test\":\"12345\"})\n   ```\n\n5. **Check API Gateway Settings**: Ensure that the API Gateway is correctly configured to accept Bearer tokens and that the authorization settings match the type of token you are generating.\n\n6. **Debugging**: If the issue persists, consider using a tool like Postman to manually test your API. This can help isolate whether the issue is with your Python script or with the API Gateway configuration.\n\n7. **Logging**: Enable logging in your API Gateway to capture more detailed error messages which might provide further insights into what might be going wrong.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and fix the issue with your API Gateway authorization."
