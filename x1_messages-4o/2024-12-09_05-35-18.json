Ideally, I want different loggers configured for different parts of my site. Currently, I have the root logger going to sys.stderr and another logger that writes to a file. However, whatever I write to the second logger gets written to its log file twice, while the root logger only prints it once. This is the code in my settings.py file:\n\n```python\nsviewlog = logging.getLogger('MyApp.views.scans')\nview_log_handler = logging.FileHandler('C:\\\\MyApp\\\\logs\\\\scan_log.log')\nview_log_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)\nview_log_handler.setFormatter(logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s %(name)-12s %(levelname)-8s %(message)s'))\nsviewlog.addHandler(view_log_handler)\n```\n\nIt seems like `addHandler()` is being called twice. When I debug, I see that the code in settings.py is executed twice, creating two FileHandlers and adding them to the same logger instance. Why is this happening and how can I prevent it? I tried moving the logger/handler instantiation code to the file where it's used but the problem persists. Can anyone tell me what's going on here?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the fact that the logger configuration code is being executed multiple times, which results in multiple handlers being added to the same logger. This can happen if your settings file is imported more than once or if the code that sets up the logger is executed in multiple contexts.\n\nHere are a few strategies to address this issue:\n\n1. **Check for Existing Handlers**: Before adding a new handler, check if the logger already has handlers. This way, you only add handlers if none exist. Here\u2019s how you can modify your code:\n\n    ```python\n    import logging\n\n    sviewlog = logging.getLogger('MyApp.views.scans')\n\n    # Check if handlers already exist\n    if not sviewlog.handlers:\n        view_log_handler = logging.FileHandler('C:\\\\MyApp\\\\logs\\\\scan_log.log')\n        view_log_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)\n        view_log_handler.setFormatter(logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s %(name)-12s %(levelname)-8s %(message)s'))\n        sviewlog.addHandler(view_log_handler)\n    ```\n\n2. **Use Django's Logging Configuration**: Django has a built-in logging configuration system that you can leverage to ensure that loggers are configured only once. You can define your loggers, handlers, and formatters in the `LOGGING` dictionary in your `settings.py`. Here's an example configuration:\n\n    ```python\n    LOGGING = {\n        'version': 1,\n        'disable_existing_loggers': False,\n        'handlers': {\n            'file': {\n                'level': 'INFO',\n                'class': 'logging.FileHandler',\n                'filename': 'C:\\\\MyApp\\\\logs\\\\scan_log.log',\n                'formatter': 'detailed',\n            },\n        },\n        'formatters': {\n            'detailed': {\n                'format': '%(asctime)s %(name)-12s %(levelname)-8s %(message)s',\n            },\n        },\n        'loggers': {\n            'MyApp.views.scans': {\n                'handlers': ['file'],\n                'level': 'INFO',\n                'propagate': False,\n            },\n        },\n    }\n    ```\n\n3. **Ensure Single Execution**: Ensure that the code in your settings file is not being run multiple times. This could be caused by circular imports or similar issues. Check your import paths and make sure your settings are only imported once.\n\n4. **Logger Propagation**: In the Django logging configuration, setting `propagate` to `False` prevents log messages from being propagated to ancestor loggers. This can help if you're seeing duplicate log entries because of propagation.\n\nBy using these strategies, you should be able to prevent the duplicate log entries caused by adding multiple handlers to the same logger."
