The source tree structure wasn't initially set up by me and everything I need to distribute is located in the top-level directory rather than a subdirectory as mentioned in the setuptools documentation. I have a directory named 'tests' which I don't want to include in the final package. However, when I tried to exclude it using 'exclude_package_data', it doesn't seem to work, and the 'tests' directory is still included. Could you help me figure out what might be going wrong? Here is the relevant part of my 'setup.py':\n\n```python\nsetup(\n  name=\"project\",\n  packages=[''],\n  include_package_data=True,\n  exclude_package_data={'': ['tests']},\n  test_suite='nose.collector',\n)\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely due to how the `exclude_package_data` option works in `setuptools`. It's designed to exclude data files, not entire directories, and it only works on packages. Since you're specifying `packages=['']`, it means you're treating the top-level directory as the package, and `exclude_package_data` won't work as expected in this context.\n\nHere's a potential solution to exclude the `tests` directory:\n\n1. **Use `find_packages()`**: If your project structure allows, use `find_packages()` to explicitly define which packages to include. This is more flexible than manually listing packages.\n\n2. **Use `package_data` and `exclude_package_data` properly**: These parameters are meant for data files within packages, not for excluding whole directories. If possible, move what you want to include into a subdirectory that can be treated as a package.\n\n3. **MANIFEST.in**: Use a `MANIFEST.in` file to specify which files to include or exclude. This is often more straightforward for controlling what goes into your source distribution.\n\nHere's how you might set it up with a `MANIFEST.in`:\n\n1. **Create a `MANIFEST.in` file** in the same directory as your `setup.py` with the following content:\n\n   ```\n   exclude tests/*\n   ```\n\n2. **Modify your `setup.py`** to use `find_packages()`:\n\n   ```python\n   from setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\n   setup(\n       name=\"project\",\n       packages=find_packages(exclude=[\"tests\"]),\n       include_package_data=True,\n       test_suite='nose.collector',\n   )\n   ```\n\nThis setup will help ensure that the `tests` directory is not included in your final package. The `MANIFEST.in` file is particularly effective for controlling what goes into the source distribution, while `find_packages(exclude=[\"tests\"])` helps filter out unwanted directories from being treated as packages."
