        "content": "I'm trying to build a Flask application using Postgres and Docker. I'm planning to use an AWS RDS instance of Postgres, but for the Flask app, I want to use Docker. However, while setting up psycopg2, I'm encountering an error because it can't find pg_config. The error occurs during the Docker container build/setup, where it appears Docker is trying to find pg_config within the container. I've tried setting up a local virtual environment and it works fine as I have Postgres installed locally and it's able to find my local pg_config. How can I install pg_config in the Docker container, even though I'm not using a containerized instance of Postgres, but rather the instance on RDS? Here's the error message I'm seeing:\n```\nBuilding api\nStep 1/5 : FROM python:3.6.3-alpine3.6\n ---&gt; 84c98ca3b5c5\nStep 2/5 : WORKDIR /usr/src/app\n ---&gt; Using cache\n ---&gt; 407c158f5ee4\nStep 3/5 : COPY . .\n ---&gt; 966df18d329e\nStep 4/5 : RUN pip install -r requirements.txt\n ---&gt; Running in 284cc97aeb63\n...\nCollecting psycopg2==2.7.3.1 (from -r requirements.txt (line 9))\n  Downloading psycopg2-2.7.3.1.tar.gz (425kB)\n...\nError: pg_config executable not found.\n...\nCommand &quot;python setup.py egg_info&quot; failed with error code 1 in /tmp/pip-build-01lf5grh/psycopg2/\nERROR: Service 'api' failed to build: The command '/bin/sh -c pip install -r requirements.txt' returned a non-zero code: 1\n```\nAnd here's my Dockerfile:\n```\nFROM python:3.6.3-alpine3.6\nWORKDIR /usr/src/app\nCOPY . .\nRUN pip install -r requirements.txt\nCMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"]\n```"

        "content": "The error message indicates that the `pg_config` executable is not found within your Docker container. This is needed for compiling the `psycopg2` package, which is a PostgreSQL adapter for Python. Since you're using an Alpine-based image, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies to provide `pg_config`. Here's how you can modify your Dockerfile to include these dependencies:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM python:3.6.3-alpine3.6\n\n# Install build dependencies\nRUN apk update && \\\n    apk add --no-cache --virtual .build-deps gcc musl-dev postgresql-dev\n\nWORKDIR /usr/src/app\nCOPY . .\n\n# Install Python dependencies\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\n\n# Remove build dependencies to reduce image size\nRUN apk del .build-deps\n\nCMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Install build dependencies:**\n   - `gcc`: The GNU Compiler Collection, needed to compile C extensions.\n   - `musl-dev`: Essential libraries for building C programs.\n   - `postgresql-dev`: Provides `pg_config` and other necessary Postgres headers for building `psycopg2`.\n\n2. **Install Python dependencies:**\n   - The `--no-cache-dir` option for `pip` ensures that no cached files are stored, keeping the image size smaller.\n\n3. **Remove build dependencies:**\n   - After installing `psycopg2`, you can safely remove the build dependencies to reduce the final image size, using `apk del .build-deps`.\n\nBy including these steps in your Dockerfile, you ensure that all necessary tools and libraries are available during the build process, thus avoiding the `pg_config` error. After making these changes, try rebuilding your Docker image and it should work without issues."
