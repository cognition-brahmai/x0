        "content": "Let's address each of your questions one by one:\n\n### 1. Calling `__init__()` Methods Directly\n\n**Is there anything wrong with calling the `__init__()` methods of the parent classes directly?**\n\nIn your first code snippet, you're directly calling the `__init__()` methods of the parent classes `First` and `Second` within the `Third` class. This approach is fine and will work as expected; however, it bypasses the Method Resolution Order (MRO), which Python uses to determine the order in which base classes are initialized. This can potentially lead to issues in a complex inheritance scenario, especially when dealing with diamond inheritance (a class structure where a single class is inherited multiple times through different paths).\n\n### 2. Using `super()` in Multiple Inheritance\n\n**When I use the `super()` function in the derived class that inherits from multiple parent classes, it only runs the `__init__()` method of the first parent class. How can I use `super()` to run the `__init__()` methods of both parent classes?**\n\nThe `super()` function in Python follows the MRO, which determines the order of method calls. In your second code snippet, `super(Third, self).__init__()` will only call the next method in the MRO, which is the `__init__()` method of the `First` class, given the inheritance order.\n\nTo ensure that all `__init__()` methods in the MRO are called, each parent class should also use `super()`:\n\n```python\nclass First(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(First, self).__init__()\n        print(\"first\")\n\nclass Second(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(Second, self).__init__()\n        print(\"second\")\n\nclass Third(First, Second):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(Third, self).__init__()\n        print(\"that's it\")\n\n# Creating an instance of Third will now print:\n# second\n# first\n# that's it\n```\n\n### 3. Supplying Different Arguments to `__init__()` Methods\n\n**If the `__init__()` methods of the inherited classes take different arguments, how can I supply the relevant arguments to the different inherited classes' `__init__()` functions using `super()`?**\n\nWhen using `super()` in a multiple inheritance scenario where different base classes require different arguments, you need to design your classes to accommodate the argument passing:\n\n1. Define a common interface for argument passing, such as using keyword arguments (`**kwargs`).\n2. Each class's `__init__()` should extract its required arguments from these keyword arguments.\n\nHere's how you could modify your third example to use `super()` with different arguments:\n\n```python\nclass First(object):\n    def __init__(self, x, **kwargs):\n        super(First, self).__init__(**kwargs)\n        print(\"first\", x)\n\nclass Second(object):\n    def __init__(self, y, z, **kwargs):\n        super(Second, self).__init__(**kwargs)\n        print(\"second\", y, z)\n\nclass Third(First, Second):\n    def __init__(self, x, y, z):\n        super(Third, self).__init__(x=x, y=y, z=z)\n        print(\"that's it\")\n\n# Creating an instance of Third with appropriate arguments will now print:\n# second y z\n# first x\n# that's it\n```\n\nIn this setup, `super()` ensures that the `__init__()` methods of both `First` and `Second` are called in the order defined by the MRO, with the correct arguments passed to each class."
