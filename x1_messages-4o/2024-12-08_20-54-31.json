        "content": "To perform sentiment analysis on a statement in Ruby using the 'Sentimental' gem, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Install the Sentimental Gem\n\nFirst, add the 'sentimental' gem to your Gemfile:\n\n```ruby\ngem 'sentimental'\n```\n\nThen, run `bundle install` to install the gem.\n\n### Step 2: Initialize and Configure Sentimental\n\nYou need to initialize and configure the Sentimental gem before using it to analyze sentiments. Here's a simple setup:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'sentimental'\n\n# Initialize the Sentimental analyzer\nanalyzer = Sentimental.new\n\n# Load the default Sentimental lexicon\nanalyzer.load_defaults\n```\n\n### Step 3: Perform Sentiment Analysis\n\nOnce initialized, you can analyze the sentiment of any statement:\n\n```ruby\n# Example statement\nstatement = \"I love programming with Ruby!\"\n\n# Analyze sentiment\nsentiment = analyzer.sentiment(statement)\nscore = analyzer.score(statement)\n\nputs \"Sentiment: #{sentiment}\" # Output will be :positive, :negative, or :neutral\nputs \"Score: #{score}\" # This gives a numerical score\n```\n\n### Step 4: Structure JSON Data for Analysis\n\nIf you want to analyze JSON data, you can parse it and extract the relevant text for analysis:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'json'\n\n# Example JSON data\njson_data = '{\n  \"comments\": [\n    {\"user\": \"Alice\", \"text\": \"I love this product!\"},\n    {\"user\": \"Bob\", \"text\": \"This is terrible.\"}\n  ]\n}'\n\n# Parse JSON\ndata = JSON.parse(json_data)\n\n# Analyze each comment\ndata['comments'].each do |comment|\n  sentiment = analyzer.sentiment(comment['text'])\n  score = analyzer.score(comment['text'])\n\n  puts \"User: #{comment['user']}, Sentiment: #{sentiment}, Score: #{score}\"\nend\n```\n\n### Additional Context-Specific Features\n\n1. **Subjectivity Detection**: \n   - The Sentimental gem does not natively support subjectivity detection. You may need to use additional NLP libraries like `TextBlob` in Python or integrate with external APIs like IBM Watson or Google Cloud Natural Language.\n\n2. **Sarcasm Detection**:\n   - Detecting sarcasm is complex and often requires more sophisticated models, such as those using machine learning or deep learning techniques. You might consider using a pre-trained model or API that specializes in sarcasm detection.\n\nFor more advanced features, you may need to explore other libraries or APIs that offer richer NLP capabilities. However, for basic sentiment analysis, the Sentimental gem is straightforward and easy to use.\n\nBy structuring your JSON data with clear text fields, you can efficiently analyze sentiment across multiple inputs. Always ensure your JSON is well-formed and that you handle potential exceptions during parsing and analysis."
