        "content": "The error you're encountering indicates that the `matplotlib` library depends on the `dateutil` module, which is not installed in your environment. To resolve this, you'll need to install the `python-dateutil` package. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Download the dateutil package**:\n   Since you're using an older version of Python (2.6), you might want to find a compatible version of `python-dateutil`. You can download it from a site like [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/) or look for a precompiled binary suitable for Python 2.6 and your Windows architecture.\n\n2. **Install python-dateutil**:\n   Once you've downloaded the appropriate package, you can install it using the following command. Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where your downloaded file is located, then run:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install python-dateutil\n   ```\n\n   If you have trouble with `pip`, you might need to install it separately as older Python installations might not include it by default. You can get `pip` by downloading `get-pip.py` from [here](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) and running it with Python.\n\n3. **Verify the installation**:\n   After the installation, try importing `python-dateutil` in a Python shell to confirm it's correctly installed:\n\n   ```python\n   import dateutil\n   ```\n\n4. **Re-import matplotlib**:\n   Now, try importing `matplotlib.pyplot` again:\n\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n   ```\n\nIf you follow these steps, you should be able to resolve the ImportError. If you encounter any additional errors, make sure to check for any other missing dependencies and install them similarly. Also, consider upgrading to a more recent version of Python if possible, as Python 2.6 is quite outdated and lacks support for many modern libraries and features."
