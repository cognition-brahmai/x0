        "content": "To calculate the number of times a specific character appears in a string, you can use a simple method in many programming languages. Here's how you can do it in a few different languages:\n\n### Python\nYou can use the `count()` method which is built into Python strings.\n\n```python\nstring = \"Mary had a little lamb\"\ncharacter = 'a'\ncount = string.count(character)\nprint(count)  # Output will be 4\n```\n\n### JavaScript\nYou can split the string into an array using the character and then find the length difference of the array.\n\n```javascript\nlet string = \"Mary had a little lamb\";\nlet character = 'a';\nlet count = string.split(character).length - 1;\nconsole.log(count);  // Output will be 4\n```\n\n### Java\nYou can iterate over the characters in the string and count how many times the character appears.\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String string = \"Mary had a little lamb\";\n        char character = 'a';\n        int count = 0;\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < string.length(); i++) {\n            if (string.charAt(i) == character) {\n                count++;\n            }\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(count);  // Output will be 4\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### C++\nYou can iterate through each character in the string and count occurrences.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    string str = \"Mary had a little lamb\";\n    char character = 'a';\n    int count = 0;\n\n    for (char c : str) {\n        if (c == character) {\n            count++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    cout << count << endl;  // Output will be 4\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThese examples should give you a good starting point for counting characters in a string using different programming languages."
