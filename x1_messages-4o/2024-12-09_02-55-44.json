I'm creating a Django application and understand that data is validated by the form before it's inserted into a model instance, which is then written to the database. However, I want to create an additional layer of protection at the data model layer. I want to make sure that a reviewer's name cannot be omitted nor be left blank. I am wondering if I should put any custom validation in the 'clean' method as I've done here, and then have 'save' call 'full_clean\" which calls 'clean'? If not, what's the preferred method?\n\nHere is the code I've written:\n\n```python\nclass Reviewer(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=128, default=None)\n\n    def clean(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        if self.name == '':\n            raise ValidationError('Reviewer name cannot be blank')\n        super(Reviewer, self).clean(*args, **kwargs)\n\n    def full_clean(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        return self.clean(*args, **kwargs)\n\n    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        self.full_clean()\n        super(Reviewer, self).save(*args, **kwargs)\n```"

        "content": "In your approach, you are correctly aiming to add an additional layer of validation at the model level, which is a good practice for ensuring data integrity. However, there are a few points to improve and simplify your implementation. Here's a refined version of your code along with explanations:\n\n```python\nfrom django.core.exceptions import ValidationError\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass Reviewer(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=128, default=None)\n\n    def clean(self):\n        if not self.name or self.name.strip() == '':\n            raise ValidationError('Reviewer name cannot be blank')\n        super().clean()\n\n    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        self.full_clean()  # This calls both clean() and model field validations\n        super().save(*args, **kwargs)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Field Definition**: \n   - `name = models.CharField(max_length=128, default=None)`: You might want to consider using `blank=False` and `null=False` in your `CharField` to prevent empty values and ensure the database level constraints. However, since you're handling it in `clean()`, it's an added layer of protection.\n   - Consider using `default=''` if you don't want `None` to be a valid entry.\n\n2. **Using `strip()`**:\n   - I added `strip()` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace when checking if the `name` is blank. This ensures that a name with just spaces is also caught as invalid.\n\n3. **`full_clean`**:\n   - You don't need to redefine `full_clean()` since calling `self.full_clean()` in `save()` will automatically call `clean()` along with field validations. The default `full_clean()` method in Django takes care of this.\n\n4. **Super Calls**:\n   - Use `super().clean()` without specifying the class name, which is a more modern and flexible approach, especially if you decide to change the class hierarchy later.\n\n5. **Validation Logic**:\n   - The `clean()` method should focus on logic that is specific to the model's data validation, which you've done correctly by checking the `name` field. Ensure you raise `ValidationError` for any condition that the data must satisfy.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you ensure that your model is protected against invalid data both at the application level and at the database level."
