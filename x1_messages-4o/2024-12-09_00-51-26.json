For example, if 'n' is 6, I would like to have 6 sublists of the original list. I have tried using list comprehension but it did not produce the desired output. How can I modify my approach to get exactly 'n' chunks which may be uneven?\n\nHere is the code I have tried:\n\n```python\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]\nl = [ x [i:i + 6] for i in range(0, len(x), 6) ]\n```\n\nThis is the output I get:\n\n```python\n[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], [25]]\n```"

        "content": "To split a list into a specific number of chunks, you can calculate the size of each chunk using the length of the list and the number of chunks you want. This might result in chunks of unequal sizes if the list cannot be evenly divided.\n\nHere's a function that does this:\n\n```python\ndef split_into_chunks(lst, n):\n    # Calculate the size of each chunk\n    avg_chunk_size = len(lst) // n\n    remainder = len(lst) % n\n    \n    chunks = []\n    start = 0\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        # Calculate the end index for the current chunk\n        end = start + avg_chunk_size + (1 if i < remainder else 0)\n        # Slice the list to form the chunk\n        chunks.append(lst[start:end])\n        start = end\n    \n    return chunks\n\n# Example usage\nx = list(range(1, 26))\nn = 6\nresult = split_into_chunks(x, n)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis function works by distributing the remainder equally across the first few chunks, ensuring that each chunk is as evenly sized as possible. When you run this code with `n = 6`, you should get output similar to this:\n\n```python\n[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12, 13], [14, 15, 16, 17], [18, 19, 20, 21], [22, 23, 24, 25]]\n``` \n\nThis ensures that the list is divided into `n` chunks, with each chunk being as evenly sized as possible."
