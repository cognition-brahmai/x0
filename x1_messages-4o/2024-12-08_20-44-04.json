Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Uninstall a Program Using PowerShell:\n\n1. **Open PowerShell with Administrative Privileges:**\n   - Press `Win + X` to open the Quick Access menu.\n   - Select `Windows PowerShell (Admin)` from the list. This will open PowerShell with the necessary permissions to uninstall programs.\n\n2. **List Installed Programs:**\n   - To see a list of all installed programs, type the following command and press Enter:\n     ```powershell\n     Get-AppxPackage\n     ```\n   - This will display a list of all apps installed through the Windows Store. If you need to list traditional desktop applications, you might need additional modules or scripts, as PowerShell's built-in commands primarily focus on Appx packages.\n\n3. **Identify the Program to Uninstall:**\n   - Look through the list to find the specific program you want to uninstall. Take note of the `PackageFullName` of the program, as you will need it for the uninstallation command.\n\n4. **Uninstall the Program:**\n   - Once you have identified the `PackageFullName`, use the following command to uninstall the program:\n     ```powershell\n     Remove-AppxPackage -Package [PackageFullName]\n     ```\n   - Replace `[PackageFullName]` with the actual name of the package you wish to uninstall.\n\n5. **Verify Uninstallation:**\n   - You can re-run the `Get-AppxPackage` command to ensure the program has been successfully removed from the list.\n\n### Difference Between Uninstalling Using PowerShell vs. Control Panel:\n\n- **Control Panel:**\n  - The Control Panel provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for uninstalling programs. It is user-friendly and ideal for most users who prefer point-and-click operations.\n  - It allows users to uninstall both traditional desktop applications and some Windows Store apps.\n  - It provides additional features like repair and change options for some programs.\n\n- **PowerShell:**\n  - PowerShell is a command-line interface, which makes it suitable for advanced users who are comfortable with scripting and command-line operations.\n  - It is particularly useful for automation, batch uninstallation, or removing system apps that might not appear in the Control Panel.\n  - PowerShell can be more efficient when dealing with a large number of installations or when integrating uninstallation into scripts for automated system setup or cleanup.\n\nIn summary, PowerShell offers more flexibility and power for advanced tasks and automation, while the Control Panel is more accessible and straightforward for everyday program management."
