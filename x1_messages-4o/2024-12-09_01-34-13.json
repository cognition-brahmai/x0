        "content": "In Python, the pipe character (`|`) is used as a bitwise OR operator. When you see `ax | bx` in a function call, it means that the bitwise OR operation is being performed on the values of `ax` and `bx`.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of what happens during a bitwise OR operation:\n\n- Each bit of the first operand is compared with the corresponding bit of the second operand.\n- If either bit is `1`, the resulting bit is set to `1`.\n- If both bits are `0`, the resulting bit is set to `0`.\n\nFor example, if `ax` is `5` (which is `0101` in binary) and `bx` is `3` (which is `0011` in binary), then `ax | bx` would result in `7` (which is `0111` in binary).\n\nThe use of the bitwise OR operator in a function call like this often indicates that the function is expecting a combination of flags or options, where each bit in the integer represents a different flag. By using the bitwise OR operator, you can combine multiple flags into a single integer value to pass to the function."
