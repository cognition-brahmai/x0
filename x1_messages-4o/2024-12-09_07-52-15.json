I want to convert this dictionary into a pandas dataframe for easier analysis. How can I achieve this, especially considering that the lists are of different lengths? My dictionary looks like this:\n\n```python\n{\n    'key1': [10, 100.1, 0.98, 1.2],\n    'key2': [72.5],\n    'key3': [1, 5.2, 71.2, 9, 10.11, 12.21, 65, 7]\n}\n```\n\nI want to use basic functions like sum, mean, describe, and std. The examples I've found so far all assume that the keys have the same number of values in the list, which is not the case for me."

        "content": "To convert a dictionary with lists of different lengths into a Pandas DataFrame, you can first transform the data so that each list is aligned with its index. This means that the lists will be padded with `NaN` to ensure they are all of the same length. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Determine the maximum length of the lists in the dictionary.\n2. Create a new dictionary where each list is padded with `NaN` to match the maximum length.\n3. Convert the padded dictionary to a DataFrame.\n\nHere's the code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The original dictionary\ndata_dict = {\n    'key1': [10, 100.1, 0.98, 1.2],\n    'key2': [72.5],\n    'key3': [1, 5.2, 71.2, 9, 10.11, 12.21, 65, 7]\n}\n\n# Determine the maximum length of lists in the dictionary\nmax_length = max(len(lst) for lst in data_dict.values())\n\n# Pad lists with NaN to ensure they are all of the same length\npadded_data = {key: lst + [np.nan]*(max_length - len(lst)) for key, lst in data_dict.items()}\n\n# Convert the padded data to a DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(padded_data)\n\n# Display the DataFrame\nprint(df)\n\n# Now you can use basic functions like sum, mean, describe, and std\nprint(\"\\nSum:\\n\", df.sum())\nprint(\"\\nMean:\\n\", df.mean())\nprint(\"\\nDescribe:\\n\", df.describe())\nprint(\"\\nStandard Deviation:\\n\", df.std())\n```\n\nThis code will convert your dictionary to a DataFrame with each key as a column, and the lists are padded with `NaN` to match the longest list. Once in DataFrame form, you can easily apply various statistical functions like `sum`, `mean`, `describe`, and `std` to the columns."
