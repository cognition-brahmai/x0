        "content": "In Python, both `os.remove()` and `os.unlink()` are used to delete files, and essentially, they perform the same function. The two functions are interchangeable when it comes to deleting files. Here's a bit more detail:\n\n- **`os.remove()`**: This function is used to remove (delete) a file path. It is a higher-level function that wraps around `os.unlink()` on Unix-like systems.\n\n- **`os.unlink()`**: This function is also used to remove a file. The term \"unlink\" comes from Unix, where it is used to refer to removing a link to a file (i.e., deleting a file).\n\nIn the context of file deletion, there is no functional difference between the two in Python on most systems, including Windows and Unix-like systems. They both remove the specified file path from the filesystem.\n\nFor your scenario, you can use either `os.remove()` or `os.unlink()`. However, it is more common to see `os.remove()` used in scripts because it is slightly more descriptive and aligns with the common terminology of \"removing\" a file. Here's a quick example of how you might use it:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Path to the folder containing the files\nfolder_path = 'path/to/your/folder'\n\n# Iterate over all files in the folder\nfor filename in os.listdir(folder_path):\n    file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, filename)\n    \n    # Process the file (placeholder for your processing code)\n    # process_file(file_path)\n    \n    # Delete the file after processing\n    os.remove(file_path)\n    # or use os.unlink(file_path)\n```\n\nMake sure you have the necessary permissions to delete the files and that you handle any potential exceptions that might occur during file processing or deletion, such as using try-except blocks for error handling."
