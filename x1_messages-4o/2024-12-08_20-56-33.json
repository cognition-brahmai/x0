        "content": "To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Find the 1001st Prime Number:**\n   The formula you mentioned, \\( P(n) = n \\times (\\log(n) + \\log(\\log(n))) \\), is an approximation for large \\( n \\). However, it's not accurate for calculating the exact nth prime number. To find the 1001st prime number, you would typically use a more direct method, like the Sieve of Eratosthenes or a prime-checking algorithm.\n\n   The 1001st prime number is actually 7927, as you've noted.\n\n2. **Find the 11th Perfect Square:**\n   The 11th perfect square is simply the square of 11. So, \\( 11^2 = 121 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Product:**\n   Now, multiply the two numbers:\n   \\[\n   7927 \\times 121 = 958567\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the product of the 1001st prime number and the 11th perfect square is indeed 958567. Your calculations were accurate!"
