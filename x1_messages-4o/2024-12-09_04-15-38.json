Each element of that tuple represents a bag. A bag might be empty, which I'm representing with `()`. At the initial point, I have just one bag with no items in it. How can I create such a tuple?"

        "content": "To create a tuple in Python that consists of just an empty tuple, you can simply use:\n\n```python\nempty_bag = ((),)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what this does:\n\n- `()` creates an empty tuple.\n- By placing a comma after the empty tuple `(),`, you create a tuple that contains the empty tuple as its single element.\n\nSo, `empty_bag` will be a tuple of length 1, where the only element is an empty tuple. This effectively represents your scenario of having one bag with no items in it.\n\nYou can verify this by checking:\n\n```python\nprint(empty_bag)       # Output: ((),)\nprint(len(empty_bag))  # Output: 1\nprint(empty_bag[0])    # Output: ()\n```\n\nThis should fit your requirement of representing a single bag with no items."
