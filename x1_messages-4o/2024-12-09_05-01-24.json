However, I seem to be facing a problem where I can't use any modules that Python 3.5 uses without any issues. For instance, PyCharm is indicating that the setup tools are not installed. When I run python3 and issue `import aiohttp`, it works fine. But when I run python36 and then `import aiohttp`, I get a ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'aiohttp'. Also, when I try to use pip in python36 (`python36 -m pip`), it says '/usr/bin/python36: No module named pip'. I have python 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 installed concurrently, and both 3.4 and 3.5 seem to be working perfectly. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "It looks like Python 3.6 was installed without pip or required modules, and it's using a different environment than Python 3.4 or 3.5. To resolve this issue, you'll need to ensure that `pip` is installed for Python 3.6 and then use it to install any necessary packages like `aiohttp`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to resolving this:\n\n1. **Ensure pip is installed for Python 3.6:**\n\n   First, try installing `pip` for Python 3.6:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo dnf install python36-pip\n   ```\n\n   If this doesn't work, you can try installing `pip` manually:\n\n   ```bash\n   curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py\n   sudo python36 get-pip.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Install the modules you need for Python 3.6:**\n\n   Once `pip` is installed for Python 3.6, you can install the required modules:\n\n   ```bash\n   python36 -m pip install aiohttp\n   ```\n\n   Repeat this step for any other modules you need.\n\n3. **Check your Python and pip versions:**\n\n   Ensure that you're using the correct version of Python and pip by checking their versions:\n\n   ```bash\n   python36 --version\n   python36 -m pip --version\n   ```\n\n   This will confirm that Python 3.6 and its pip are properly installed and being used.\n\n4. **Configure PyCharm:**\n\n   Make sure PyCharm is using the correct Python interpreter. Go to `File > Settings > Project: YourProjectName > Python Interpreter` and ensure that Python 3.6 is selected. If it\u2019s not there, you may need to add it manually by pointing it to the Python 3.6 executable.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to use Python 3.6 with the necessary modules and pip. Let me know if you encounter any further issues!"
