I have a process where I run a few iterations of simulation code, create a plot of its current state, run more iterations and then update the plot to reflect the new state. I want to do this without any user interaction and without destroying and recreating the whole plot each time. I have some code, slightly modified from the answer to a similar question, which redraws the figure each time. How can I achieve the same result but more efficiently using nbagg?\n\nHere is the code I am currently using:\n\n```python\n%matplotlib inline\nimport time\nimport pylab as pl\nfrom IPython import display\nfor i in range(10):\n    pl.clf()\n    pl.plot(pl.randn(100))\n    display.display(pl.gcf())\n    display.clear_output(wait=True)\n    time.sleep(1.0)\n```"

        "content": "To efficiently update plots in a Jupyter or IPython notebook using the `nbagg` backend without destroying and recreating the entire plot each time, you need to use an approach that updates the plot's data instead of clearing and redrawing the entire figure. This can be achieved by manipulating the plot objects directly.\n\nHere's an example of how you can do this using `matplotlib` with the `nbagg` backend. This approach involves updating the data of the plot instead of clearing and redrawing it:\n\n```python\n%matplotlib notebook  # Use the nbagg backend\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport time\n\n# Initialize the plot\nplt.ion()  # Turn on interactive mode\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nline, = ax.plot(np.random.randn(100))  # Initial plot\n\n# Update the plot in a loop\nfor i in range(10):\n    # Update the y-data of the plot\n    line.set_ydata(np.random.randn(100))\n    \n    # Adjust the y-limits if necessary, or use a fixed range\n    ax.relim()\n    ax.autoscale_view()\n\n    # Draw the updated plot\n    fig.canvas.draw()\n    fig.canvas.flush_events()\n    time.sleep(1.0)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Interactive Mode**: `plt.ion()` turns on interactive mode, which allows for dynamic updates to the plot.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Plot**: We create the plot once outside the loop. The `line, = ax.plot(...)` line creates a line object that we can update in each iteration.\n\n3. **Updating the Plot**: Inside the loop, we update the y-data of the existing line object using `line.set_ydata(...)`. This efficiently changes the data being plotted without recreating the plot.\n\n4. **Autoscaling**: If the range of your data changes, `ax.relim()` and `ax.autoscale_view()` ensure that the axes are rescaled to fit the new data.\n\n5. **Redrawing the Plot**: `fig.canvas.draw()` and `fig.canvas.flush_events()` update the plot on the screen.\n\nBy using this approach, you minimize the overhead of recreating the plot and take advantage of the interactive plotting capabilities of `matplotlib`."
