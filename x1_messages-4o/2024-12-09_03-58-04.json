        "content": "No, it is not necessary to combine GPUs via SLI for CUDA programming. SLI (Scalable Link Interface) is primarily used for gaming and graphics applications to improve rendering performance by allowing multiple GPUs to work together. However, for CUDA programming, which is focused on parallel computing rather than graphics rendering, you do not need to use SLI.\n\nIn CUDA programming, you can utilize multiple GPUs independently without SLI. CUDA provides APIs to manage and work with multiple GPUs in a single machine. You can select a specific GPU to run your computations by setting the device using `cudaSetDevice()`. Each GPU can be controlled independently, allowing you to distribute your computational workload across multiple GPUs for better performance and resource utilization.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you might select and use multiple GPUs in a CUDA program:\n\n```c\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#define N 1000\n\n__global__ void kernel(float *data) {\n    int idx = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;\n    if (idx < N) {\n        data[idx] += 1.0f;\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int deviceCount;\n    cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);\n\n    if (deviceCount < 2) {\n        fprintf(stderr, \"This program requires at least two GPUs.\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    float *d_data0, *d_data1;\n    cudaSetDevice(0);\n    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_data0, N * sizeof(float));\n    cudaSetDevice(1);\n    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_data1, N * sizeof(float));\n\n    // Launch kernels on both GPUs\n    cudaSetDevice(0);\n    kernel<<<(N + 255) / 256, 256>>>(d_data0);\n    cudaSetDevice(1);\n    kernel<<<(N + 255) / 256, 256>>>(d_data1);\n\n    // Clean up\n    cudaSetDevice(0);\n    cudaFree(d_data0);\n    cudaSetDevice(1);\n    cudaFree(d_data1);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the program checks for the number of available GPUs and runs a simple kernel on each. Notice how `cudaSetDevice()` is used to switch between GPUs. This approach allows you to leverage the full computational power of your system without the need for SLI."
