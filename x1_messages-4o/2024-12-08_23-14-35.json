A list of jokes is defined, each containing an animal and the corresponding joke.\n2. The jokes are saved to a JSON file named `animal_jokes.json`.\n3. A function `get_joke` is defined to retrieve a joke about a specified animal.\n4. The program prints out a joke about a chicken crossing the road by calling the `get_joke` function with `\"chicken\"` as the argument.\n\nThis program can easily be extended by adding more jokes to the `jokes` list."
