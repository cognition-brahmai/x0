Here's a step-by-step approach to find the top 10 most common words in a given text, excluding any words that are shorter than four letters:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nfunc top10CommonWords(in text: String) -> [String] {\n    // Step 1: Normalize the text by converting it to lowercase\n    let lowercasedText = text.lowercased()\n    \n    // Step 2: Use CharacterSet to separate the words by eliminating punctuation\n    let wordsArray = lowercasedText.components(separatedBy: CharacterSet.punctuationCharacters.union(.whitespacesAndNewlines))\n    \n    // Step 3: Filter out words that are less than 4 characters long\n    let filteredWords = wordsArray.filter { $0.count >= 4 }\n    \n    // Step 4: Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each word\n    var wordCounts: [String: Int] = [:]\n    \n    for word in filteredWords {\n        wordCounts[word, default: 0] += 1\n    }\n    \n    // Step 5: Sort the words by their count in descending order and get the top 10\n    let sortedWords = wordCounts.sorted { $0.value > $1.value }\n    let top10Words = sortedWords.prefix(10).map { $0.key }\n    \n    return top10Words\n}\n\n// Example usage\nlet text = \"\"\"\nIn a world where technology evolves at an unprecedented pace, the need for advanced artificial intelligence has never been greater. Swift, as a programming language, offers the necessary tools for developers to create innovative solutions that can tackle complex problems with efficiency and precision.\n\"\"\"\n\nlet topWords = top10CommonWords(in: text)\nprint(\"Top 10 most common words:\", topWords)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Normalization**: Convert the text to lowercase to ensure that the word counting is case-insensitive.\n\n2. **Word Separation**: Split the text into words using `components(separatedBy:)`, removing punctuation and whitespace.\n\n3. **Filtering**: Use a filter to exclude words that are shorter than four letters.\n\n4. **Counting**: Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each word.\n\n5. **Sorting and Selecting**: Sort the dictionary by the count of occurrences in descending order and select the top 10 words.\n\nThis code will give you the top 10 most common words in the given text, excluding words shorter than four letters."
