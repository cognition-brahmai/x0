The current directory is /PYTHON and I want to pass file.txt as an argument to python script boot.py. Here is my Dockerfile:\n\n```Dockerfile\nFROM python\nCOPY boot.py ./\nCOPY file.txt ./\nRUN pip install numpy\nCMD [\"python\", \"boot.py\", \"file.txt\"]\n```\nI successfully built the Docker container with `docker build -t boot/latest .` and ran the container with `docker run -t boot:latest python boot.py file.txt`, which produced the correct results. However, when I copy another file, file1.txt, to the current directory from a different directory (not /PYTHON) and run the container again with `docker run -t boot:latest python boot.py file1.txt`, I get a `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'file1.txt'`. This error is due to the fact that file1.txt is not in the container. If I want to share this container with a friend who might want to pass a different file as an argument, how can I modify the Dockerfile so that anyone with my container can pass different files as arguments without errors? I am new to Docker and appreciate any help in advance."

        "content": "To enable passing different files as arguments to your Docker container without needing to rebuild the image each time, you can use Docker's volume mounting feature. This allows you to mount a directory from your host machine into the container at runtime, making the files within that directory accessible to the container.\n\nHere's how you can modify your approach:\n\n1. **Modify the Dockerfile**: Remove the `COPY file.txt ./` line from the Dockerfile since you don't want to hard-code a specific file into the image. Your Dockerfile should look like this:\n\n   ```Dockerfile\n   FROM python\n   COPY boot.py ./\n   RUN pip install numpy\n   CMD [\"python\", \"boot.py\"]\n   ```\n\n2. **Run the Docker Container with Volume Mounting**: When running the container, use the `-v` option to mount a directory from your host to the container. You can specify the location of the file in the container and pass it as an argument to your script. For example, if you want to pass `file1.txt` located in a different directory on your host machine, you can do so like this:\n\n   ```bash\n   docker run -v /path/to/your/files:/data -t boot:latest python boot.py /data/file1.txt\n   ```\n\n   In this command, `/path/to/your/files` is the directory on your host machine where `file1.txt` is located. The `-v /path/to/your/files:/data` option mounts this directory to `/data` inside the container. Then, you pass `/data/file1.txt` as the argument to your script.\n\n3. **Share the Container**: When sharing the container with your friend, instruct them to use the `-v` option to mount their own directory containing the desired file. They can then pass the file path within the container as an argument to the script.\n\nBy using this method, you make your Docker container flexible for different input files without modifying the Dockerfile or rebuilding the image."
