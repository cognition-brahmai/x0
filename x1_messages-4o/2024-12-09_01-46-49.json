        "content": "XPath is a powerful language used to navigate through elements and attributes in an XML document. In Python, you have several libraries that support XPath, with common ones being `lxml` and `ElementTree`.\n\n### Libraries Supporting XPath in Python:\n\n1. **lxml**: This is a powerful library that provides a full implementation of XPath. It\u2019s based on the C libraries libxml2 and libxslt, making it very efficient for parsing XML and HTML.\n\n2. **ElementTree**: This is part of Python\u2019s standard library (since Python 2.5) and provides basic support for XPath.\n\n### Example using lxml:\n\nYou can install `lxml` using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install lxml\n```\n\nHere\u2019s a basic example of how you can use `lxml` to apply XPath:\n\n```python\nfrom lxml import etree\n\n# Sample XML data\nxml_data = \"\"\"\n<books>\n    <book id=\"1\">\n        <title>Python Programming</title>\n        <author>John Doe</author>\n    </book>\n    <book id=\"2\">\n        <title>Learning XML</title>\n        <author>Jane Smith</author>\n    </book>\n</books>\n\"\"\"\n\n# Parse the XML data\ntree = etree.XML(xml_data)\n\n# Use XPath to find all book titles\ntitles = tree.xpath('//book/title/text()')\n\n# Print the titles\nfor title in titles:\n    print(title)\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n\n```\nPython Programming\nLearning XML\n```\n\n### Official Website:\n\nThe official website for `lxml` is [lxml.de](https://lxml.de/), where you can find more documentation and examples.\n\n### Example using ElementTree:\n\n`ElementTree` is included with Python, so you don\u2019t need to install it separately. Here\u2019s a simple example:\n\n```python\nimport xml.etree.ElementTree as ET\n\n# Sample XML data\nxml_data = \"\"\"\n<books>\n    <book id=\"1\">\n        <title>Python Programming</title>\n        <author>John Doe</author>\n    </book>\n    <book id=\"2\">\n        <title>Learning XML</title>\n        <author>Jane Smith</author>\n    </book>\n</books>\n\"\"\"\n\n# Parse the XML data\ntree = ET.ElementTree(ET.fromstring(xml_data))\n\n# Use XPath to find all book titles\n# Note: ElementTree has limited XPath support (no 'text()' function directly)\ntitles = tree.findall('.//title')\n\n# Print the titles\nfor title in titles:\n    print(title.text)\n```\n\nThis will output the same result:\n\n```\nPython Programming\nLearning XML\n```\n\n`ElementTree` is suitable for simpler tasks and is readily available as part of Python's standard library, while `lxml` is more powerful and recommended for complex XML tasks."
