The program should be able to identify irregular plural forms like \"geese\" for \"goose\" and \"children\" for \"child\". It should also recognize exceptions such as \"mice\" for \"mouse\" and \"deer\" for \"deer\". You will be given a string as input, and your program should return the appropriate pluralized form of the word. Can you solve this puzzle?"
