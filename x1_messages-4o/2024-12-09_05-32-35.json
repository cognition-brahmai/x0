        "content": "In Python, both `collections.Iterable` and `typing.Iterable` can be used to work with iterable objects, but they serve different purposes and have different use cases:\n\n1. **`collections.Iterable`:**\n   - This is part of the `collections.abc` module in Python and is used to check if an object is iterable at runtime.\n   - It is a part of the Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) for data structures in Python.\n   - Usage: It is typically used with `isinstance()` to check if an object implements the iterable protocol.\n   - Example: `isinstance(obj, collections.abc.Iterable)`\n\n2. **`typing.Iterable`:**\n   - This is part of the `typing` module and is used primarily for type hinting and static type checking.\n   - It is not used for runtime checks but rather helps with tools that support type checking, like `mypy`.\n   - Usage: It is used in function annotations to indicate that a parameter or return value is expected to be iterable.\n   - Example: `def func(items: typing.Iterable[int]) -> None:`\n\n**Differences and Preferences:**\n\n- **Runtime vs. Static Check:** `collections.Iterable` is used for runtime checks to see if an object is iterable, whereas `typing.Iterable` is used for static type hints and does not perform any checks at runtime.\n- **Use Case:** Use `collections.abc.Iterable` when you need to check the iterability of an object during execution. Use `typing.Iterable` for type annotations to clarify your code's expectations and improve static analysis.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```python\nfrom collections.abc import Iterable as ColIterable\nfrom typing import Iterable as TypIterable\n\n# Runtime check\ndef is_iterable(obj):\n    return isinstance(obj, ColIterable)\n\n# Static type hinting\ndef process_items(items: TypIterable[int]) -> None:\n    for item in items:\n        print(item)\n\n# Example objects\nobj_list = [1, 2, 3]\nobj_non_iter = 123\n\nprint(is_iterable(obj_list))  # True\nprint(is_iterable(obj_non_iter))  # False\n\nprocess_items(obj_list)  # Works correctly with static type hint\n```\n\nIn summary, use `collections.abc.Iterable` for runtime checks and `typing.Iterable` for static type hints in your code."
