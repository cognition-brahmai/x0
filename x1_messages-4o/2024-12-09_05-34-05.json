        "content": "To minimize your target function using `scipy.optimize.minimize` with constraints, you need to set up your optimization problem accordingly. You have a constraint that `t[0] + t[1] = 1`, which can be expressed as an equality constraint. Here's how you can set it up:\n\n1. **Define the Constraint**: You need to define the constraint in a format that `scipy.optimize.minimize` can understand. Constraints are generally specified as dictionaries with 'type' and 'fun' keys.\n\n2. **Set Up the Initial Guess**: Provide an initial guess for the values of `t`. This is necessary for the optimization algorithm to start searching for the solution.\n\n3. **Call the Minimizer**: Use `scipy.optimize.minimize` and pass the target function, initial guess, and constraints.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\n# Define the matrix\narr = np.array([[0.8, 0.2], [-0.1, 0.14]])\n\n# Define the matrix function\ndef matr_t(t):\n    return np.array([[t[0], 0], [t[2] + complex(0, 1) * t[3], t[1]]])\n\n# Define the target function\ndef target(t):\n    arr2 = matr_t(t)\n    ret = 0\n    for i, v1 in enumerate(arr):\n        for j, v2 in enumerate(v1):\n            ret += abs(arr[i][j] - arr2[i][j])**2\n    return ret\n\n# Define the constraint: t[0] + t[1] = 1\ncons = {'type': 'eq', 'fun': lambda t: t[0] + t[1] - 1}\n\n# Initial guess for t\ninitial_guess = [0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0]\n\n# Perform the optimization\nresult = minimize(target, initial_guess, constraints=cons)\n\n# Output the result\nprint('Optimized parameters:', result.x)\nprint('Minimum value of the target function:', result.fun)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Constraint**: The constraint is defined using a lambda function that represents `t[0] + t[1] - 1 = 0`.\n- **Initial Guess**: The initial guess `[0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0]` is a reasonable starting point, given your constraint.\n- **Optimization**: The `minimize` function is called with the target function, the initial guess, and the constraints. The result contains the optimized parameters and the minimum value of the target function.\n\nThe optimization might require tuning the initial guess or using a different solver depending on the complexity of the problem. By default, `minimize` uses the 'SLSQP' method which handles both bounds and constraints well."
