With normal inheritance, the following code works:\n\n```python\nclass Y(object):\n    def __init__(self, a, b, c):\n        self.a = a\n        self.b = b\n        self.c = c\n\n\nclass Z(Y):\n    def __init__(self, a, b, c, d):\n        super(Z, self).__init__(a, b, c)\n        self.d = d\n```\n\nIn the Python console, creating an instance of `Z` results in:\n\n```python\n>>> Z(1,2,3,4)\n<__main__.Z object at 0x10fcad950>\n```\n\nHowever, when I try to use a namedtuple as the base class like so:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import namedtuple\n\nX = namedtuple('X', 'a b c')\n\nclass Z(X):\n    def __init__(self, a, b, c, d):\n        super(Z, self).__init__(a, b, c)\n        self.d = d\n```\n\nI get a `TypeError` when creating an instance of `Z`:\n\n```python\n>>> Z(1,2,3,4)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nTypeError: __new__() takes exactly 4 arguments (5 given)\n```\n\nIs it possible to use a namedtuple as a base class in Python? If so, how?"

        "content": "Yes, it is possible to use a `namedtuple` as a base class in Python, but there are some nuances to be aware of, particularly because `namedtuple` uses the `__new__` method for initialization, rather than `__init__`. This means you need to modify your subclass to account for the way `namedtuple` instances are created.\n\nHere's how you can inherit from a `namedtuple` and add additional attributes:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import namedtuple\n\n# Define the namedtuple\nX = namedtuple('X', 'a b c')\n\n# Define the subclass\nclass Z(X):\n    def __new__(cls, a, b, c, d):\n        # Call the parent class's __new__ method with the first three arguments\n        instance = super(Z, cls).__new__(cls, a, b, c)\n        # Add the additional attribute\n        instance.d = d\n        return instance\n\n# Test the subclass\nz_instance = Z(1, 2, 3, 4)\nprint(z_instance)       # Output: Z(a=1, b=2, c=3)\nprint(z_instance.d)     # Output: 4\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **`__new__` Method**: Since `namedtuple` uses `__new__` instead of `__init__`, you need to override `__new__` in your subclass to handle the additional arguments. This method is responsible for creating and returning a new instance of the class.\n\n2. **Calling `super().__new__`**: You call `super(Z, cls).__new__(cls, a, b, c)` to create an instance of the named tuple with the appropriate attributes (`a`, `b`, `c`).\n\n3. **Setting Additional Attributes**: After creating the instance, you can add additional attributes directly, like `instance.d = d`.\n\nThis approach allows you to effectively extend a `namedtuple` with additional attributes while maintaining the immutability and lightweight nature of the `namedtuple` for the fields `a`, `b`, and `c`."
