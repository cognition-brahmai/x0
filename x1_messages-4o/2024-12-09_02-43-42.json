I have a project structure like this:\n\n```\nproject/\n    __init__.py\n    /code\n        __init__.py\n        sut.py\n    /tests\n        __init__.py\n        test_sut.py\n```\n\nIn my `test_sut.py`, I'm trying to import `sut` from `code` module like this:\n\n```python\nimport code.sut\n```\n\nHowever, when I run nosetests in the root directory, I get an `ImportError: No module named code.sut`. \n\nI've tried a few solutions including doing a relative import with `from ..code import sut`, adding the root of the project to `PYTHONPATH`, using `sys.path.append` to add the `..` path before the imports at the start of each test module and installing the modules into the site-packages before running tests with `setup.py`. However, none of these solutions feel \"natural\" and some of them have proved problematic. What is the recommended way to do this?"

        "content": "When dealing with module imports in a directory structure like yours, and especially when using a testing framework like `nose`, it's important to ensure that Python's module search path (i.e., `sys.path`) is correctly set up so that it can locate your modules.\n\nHere\u2019s a recommended approach to manage imports in your test files:\n\n1. **Use a `tests` package**: Make sure your `tests` directory is treated as a package. You've already done this by including an `__init__.py` file inside the `tests` directory.\n\n2. **Modify `sys.path` in a test configuration file**: You can create a `conftest.py` file in your `tests` directory to modify the `sys.path` before any tests are run. This is a common pattern in testing setups:\n\n    ```python\n    # project/tests/conftest.py\n    import sys\n    from os.path import abspath, dirname, join\n\n    # Calculate the project's root directory\n    project_root = abspath(join(dirname(__file__), '..'))\n\n    # Add the project root to sys.path\n    sys.path.insert(0, project_root)\n    ```\n\n    By doing this, you ensure that the root directory of your project is added to the Python path, allowing you to import modules using absolute imports like `import code.sut`.\n\n3. **Use Absolute Imports in Tests**: With the `sys.path` set up, you should be able to use absolute imports in your test files. In `test_sut.py`, you can do:\n\n    ```python\n    import code.sut\n    ```\n\n4. **Run Tests from the Project Root**: Always run your tests from the root of the project directory. This can be done by executing `nosetests` from the root level:\n\n    ```bash\n    cd /path/to/project\n    nosetests\n    ```\n\n5. **Alternative Using `pytest`**: If you still encounter difficulties, consider switching to `pytest`, which is another popular testing framework. It has more advanced configuration options and often handles imports more gracefully:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install pytest\n    pytest\n    ```\n\nBy following these steps, you can maintain a clean and effective test setup without needing to resort to workarounds like modifying `PYTHONPATH` manually or adding `sys.path.append` calls in every test file."
