        "content": "Designing a password authentication system with the specified requirements involves creating rules and constraints to ensure that the passwords are both secure and difficult to crack. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to design such a system and a Python code example to calculate the entropy based on the valid combinations.\n\n### Password Requirements:\n1. Minimum length of 10 characters.\n2. At least two uppercase letters.\n3. At least two lowercase letters.\n4. At least two numbers.\n5. At least two special characters.\n6. No repeated characters.\n7. No consecutive numbers or letters.\n\n### Design Approach:\n1. **Character Set**: Consider the sets of uppercase letters (26), lowercase letters (26), digits (10), and special characters (e.g., `!@#$%^&*()-_` and more, typically around 32).\n\n2. **Password Generation**:\n   - Ensure at least two characters from each category.\n   - Shuffle the chosen characters to avoid predictable patterns.\n   - Ensure no repeated characters and no consecutive numbers or letters.\n\n3. **Entropy Calculation**:\n   - Calculate the entropy based on the number of possible combinations, ensuring the constraints are met.\n\n### Python Code Example for Entropy Calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport itertools\n\ndef calculate_entropy():\n    # Define character sets\n    uppercase = 26  # A-Z\n    lowercase = 26  # a-z\n    digits = 10     # 0-9\n    special_chars = 32  # Assume 32 special characters\n\n    # Calculate possible combinations for each category\n    total_chars = uppercase + lowercase + digits + special_chars\n    \n    # Number of ways to choose two characters from each category\n    uppercase_combinations = math.comb(uppercase, 2)\n    lowercase_combinations = math.comb(lowercase, 2)\n    digit_combinations = math.comb(digits, 2)\n    special_combinations = math.comb(special_chars, 2)\n\n    # Remaining characters to fill\n    remaining_length = 10 - 8  # 2 from each category already used\n    \n    # Total possible combinations for remaining characters\n    remaining_combinations = math.comb(total_chars - 8, remaining_length)\n\n    # Calculate the total number of valid password combinations\n    total_combinations = (uppercase_combinations *\n                          lowercase_combinations *\n                          digit_combinations *\n                          special_combinations *\n                          remaining_combinations)\n\n    # Calculate entropy\n    entropy = math.log2(total_combinations)\n    \n    return entropy\n\nentropy = calculate_entropy()\nprint(f\"The entropy of the password system is: {entropy:.2f} bits\")\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Combinatory Math**: `math.comb(n, k)` is used to calculate the number of combinations of `k` items from a set of `n` items.\n- **Entropy Calculation**: Entropy is calculated as the logarithm base 2 of the total number of combinations, representing the number of bits required to express the total set of possible passwords.\n- **Assumptions**: The code assumes a set of 32 special characters. Adjust this based on your actual special character set.\n\nThis system design and code ensure that the passwords are strong, meeting all the given constraints, and the entropy calculation reflects the complexity of the password space."
