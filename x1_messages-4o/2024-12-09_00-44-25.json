Despite my attempts to patch the logger, I could only find a getLogger mock. How can I patch or mock logging.getLogger() for this purpose?\n\nCode:\n```python\nlog = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\nclass A(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        log.debug('Init')\n```"

        "content": "To test if `log.debug` was called with a specific argument, you can use the `unittest.mock` module to patch the `logging.getLogger` method and then verify the calls made to the logger instance. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport logging\nimport unittest\nfrom unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock\n\n# Your class code\nlog = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\nclass A(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        log.debug('Init')\n\n# Test case\nclass TestLogging(unittest.TestCase):\n\n    @patch('your_module_name.logging.getLogger')\n    def test_logging(self, mock_get_logger):\n        # Create a mock logger instance\n        mock_logger = MagicMock()\n        mock_get_logger.return_value = mock_logger\n        \n        # Instantiate the class to trigger the log.debug call\n        a = A()\n        \n        # Assert that the debug method was called with 'Init'\n        mock_logger.debug.assert_called_once_with('Init')\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\nReplace `'your_module_name'` with the actual name of the module where your class `A` is defined.\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Patching `logging.getLogger`**: We use the `@patch` decorator to patch the `logging.getLogger` method. This allows us to replace it with a mock object.\n\n2. **Mock Logger**: We create a `MagicMock` instance to act as our mock logger. We set this mock logger as the return value of `mock_get_logger`.\n\n3. **Instantiate Class**: By creating an instance of `A`, we trigger the `__init__` method, which should call `log.debug('Init')`.\n\n4. **Assertion**: We use `assert_called_once_with` to verify that `debug` was called exactly once with the argument `'Init'`.\n\nBy using this approach, you can effectively test that your logging statements are being executed as expected."
