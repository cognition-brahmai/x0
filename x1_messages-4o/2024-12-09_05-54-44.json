I have a dataframe column like this: \n```python\nrange\n\"(2,30)\"\n\"(50,290)\"\n\"(400,1000)\"\n...\n```\nI'm aiming to replace the comma `,` with a dash `-`. I have tried using the following method but it doesn't seem to work. \n```python\norg_info_exc['range'].replace(',', '-', inplace=True)\n```\nCan anyone provide a solution to this problem?"

        "content": "To replace a specific text within a string column in a pandas DataFrame, you can use the `str.replace()` method, which is specifically designed for string operations on pandas Series (which a DataFrame column essentially is). The `replace()` method you were using works for replacing entire entries in the column, not substrings within those entries. Here\u2019s how you can achieve your goal:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {'range': [\"(2,30)\", \"(50,290)\", \"(400,1000)\"]}\norg_info_exc = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Replace comma with dash in the 'range' column\norg_info_exc['range'] = org_info_exc['range'].str.replace(',', '-')\n\nprint(org_info_exc)\n```\n\nThis will correctly replace the commas with dashes in each string within the 'range' column. The `str.replace()` method applies the replacement to each string element in the Series."
