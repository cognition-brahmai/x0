        "content": "Certainly! To estimate the net worth of Amazon's CEO using PHP and a SQL database, you'll need to follow these general steps:\n\n1. **Set up your environment**: Ensure you have PHP and a SQL database (e.g., MySQL) set up and connected.\n\n2. **Create a SQL database**: Store information regarding the CEO's investments and assets. This can include tables for stocks, real estate, other investments, and liabilities.\n\n3. **Write PHP code**: Fetch data from the database and calculate the net worth.\n\nHere is a simplified example to demonstrate this process:\n\n### SQL Database Setup\n\nLet's assume we have a MySQL database with two tables: `assets` and `liabilities`.\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE assets (\n    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    type VARCHAR(255),\n    value DECIMAL(15, 2)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE liabilities (\n    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    type VARCHAR(255),\n    value DECIMAL(15, 2)\n);\n\n-- Sample data\nINSERT INTO assets (type, value) VALUES ('Stocks', 100000000.00), ('Real Estate', 50000000.00);\nINSERT INTO liabilities (type, value) VALUES ('Loan', 10000000.00);\n```\n\n### PHP Code\n\n```php\n<?php\n\n// Database connection configuration\n$host = 'localhost';\n$db = 'net_worth_db';\n$user = 'root';\n$pass = 'password';\n\ntry {\n    // Create a new PDO instance\n    $pdo = new PDO(\"mysql:host=$host;dbname=$db\", $user, $pass);\n    $pdo->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);\n\n    // Fetch total assets\n    $stmt = $pdo->query(\"SELECT SUM(value) AS total_assets FROM assets\");\n    $assets = $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)['total_assets'];\n\n    // Fetch total liabilities\n    $stmt = $pdo->query(\"SELECT SUM(value) AS total_liabilities FROM liabilities\");\n    $liabilities = $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)['total_liabilities'];\n\n    // Calculate net worth\n    $netWorth = $assets - $liabilities;\n\n    echo \"Estimated Net Worth: $\" . number_format($netWorth, 2);\n    \n} catch (PDOException $e) {\n    echo \"Error: \" . $e->getMessage();\n}\n\n?>\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Database Connection**: The code establishes a connection to a MySQL database using PDO.\n\n2. **Data Retrieval**: It retrieves the total value of assets and liabilities using SQL `SUM()`.\n\n3. **Net Worth Calculation**: The net worth is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets.\n\n4. **Output**: The estimated net worth is formatted and displayed.\n\n### Note\n\n- This example is highly simplified and assumes you have direct access to accurate and up-to-date financial data for the CEO.\n- In a real-world scenario, you would need to consider various factors such as taxes, currency fluctuations, and private investments.\n- Ensure you handle sensitive data securely and adhere to privacy and data protection regulations.\n\nFeel free to modify the code to suit the structure of your database and the specifics of your data."
