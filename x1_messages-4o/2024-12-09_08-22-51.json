You can use the `re.findall()` function to find all occurrences of a pattern in a string and then count the matches. Here's how you can do it for your specific case:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Define the string\ntext = \"It actually happened when it acted out of turn.\"\n\n# Define the regex pattern\npattern = r\"t a\"\n\n# Use re.findall() to find all matches of the pattern in the string\nmatches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n\n# Get the number of matches\nnumber_of_matches = len(matches)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"The pattern '{pattern}' appears {number_of_matches} times in the string.\")\n```\n\nIn this example, `re.findall()` returns a list of all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string, and `len()` is used to count how many matches were found."
