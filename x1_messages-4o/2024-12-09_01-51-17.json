I want to replace the value of these selected rows in the 'Cabin' column with 1. However, when I run my current code, it replaces all values of the 'Cabin' column with 1, including NaN values. How can I modify my code to only replace the selected rows? Here is my current code:\n\n```python\ntrain['Cabin'] = train[train['Pclass']==1]['Cabin']=1\n```"

        "content": "The issue with your current code is that it's performing an assignment in a way that affects the whole 'Cabin' column instead of just the rows where 'Pclass' is 1. You can achieve the desired result by using the `.loc` accessor to target only those rows in the 'Cabin' column where 'Pclass' is 1. Here\u2019s how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\ntrain.loc[train['Pclass'] == 1, 'Cabin'] = 1\n```\n\nThis code uses the `.loc` method to select rows where `Pclass` is 1 and then assigns the value 1 to the 'Cabin' column of those specific rows. This way, only the appropriate rows are modified, and NaN values or other rows remain unchanged."
