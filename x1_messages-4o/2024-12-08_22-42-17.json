The first stage uses 3 engines, each with a thrust of 100,000N, and lasts for 180 seconds. The second stage uses a single engine with a thrust of 50,000N, and lasts for 300 seconds. The rocket is launched vertically, and gravity can be assumed to be a constant 9.81 m/s^2. The code should output the altitude and velocity of the rocket at each second during the launch process."
