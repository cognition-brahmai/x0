        "content": "Yes, you can swap the first and second columns of a pandas DataFrame in a way that is quite convenient. You can achieve this using pandas by reordering the columns. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Example DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'A': [1, 2, 3],\n    'B': [4, 5, 6],\n    'C': [7, 8, 9]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Reorder columns to swap the first and second columns\ndf = df[['B', 'A'] + df.columns[2:].tolist()]\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nIn this code, `df[['B', 'A'] + df.columns[2:].tolist()]` creates a new column order by swapping the first two columns and appending the rest of the columns as they are. This is similar to how you would specify column order in MATLAB."
