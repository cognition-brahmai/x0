The first receiver is being called correctly after an update on the Game object, but the calls to update on the MyPick object are not causing the second receiver to be called. Can the `post_save` signal work on updates or is there something else I'm missing?\n\n```python\n@receiver(post_save, sender=Game, dispatch_uid='game_updated')\ndef game_updated(sender, **kwargs):\n\n    '''DO SOME STUFF HERE'''\n\n    MyPick.objects.filter(week=game.week, team=game.home_team).update(result=home_result)\n    MyPick.objects.filter(week=game.week, team=game.away_team).update(result=away_result)\n\n\n@receiver(post_save, sender=MyPick, dispatch_uid='user_pick_updated')\ndef update_standings(sender, **kwargs):\n    '''DO STUFF'''\n```"

        "content": "In Django, the `post_save` signal can indeed be triggered on both create and update operations, so the issue you're facing might be due to a few possible reasons. Let's go through some common troubleshooting steps:\n\n1. **Signal Connection**: Ensure that the signal handlers are connected properly. The `@receiver` decorator should be placed above the function definition as you have done, but make sure these definitions are executed during the Django app's startup. The module where these signals are defined should be imported in the `ready` method of the `AppConfig` class of your app.\n\n2. **Signal Senders**: Double-check that the sender specified in the `@receiver` decorator matches the actual model that triggers the signal. It seems correct in your provided code, but ensure `MyPick` is indeed the model that should trigger the `user_pick_updated` signal.\n\n3. **Signal Dispatch UID**: The `dispatch_uid` is used to uniquely identify a receiver. This helps prevent duplicate signals. Ensure that the `dispatch_uid` is unique across your project for different receivers.\n\n4. **Signal Conditions**: By default, `post_save` is triggered on both create and update. If you want to filter it only for updates, you should check the `created` flag in the `kwargs`:\n\n    ```python\n    @receiver(post_save, sender=MyPick, dispatch_uid='user_pick_updated')\n    def update_standings(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):\n        if not created:  # This ensures the signal is only processed on updates\n            '''DO STUFF'''\n    ```\n\n5. **Transaction Management**: If your update is within a transaction, ensure that the transaction is committed. Signals are sent after the database transaction has been committed.\n\n6. **Logging and Debugging**: Add some logging or print statements inside the `user_pick_updated` receiver to check whether it is being invoked and to see the state of the `MyPick` instances being updated.\n\n7. **Check for Errors**: Review your server logs or add try-except blocks to catch any exceptions that might be preventing the signal from being processed.\n\nHere's an example of how you can include logging for debugging:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n@receiver(post_save, sender=MyPick, dispatch_uid='user_pick_updated')\ndef update_standings(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):\n    if not created:\n        logger.info(f\"Updating standings for MyPick: {instance.id}\")\n        '''DO STUFF'''\n```\n\nMake sure your logging is configured correctly in the Django settings to capture these logs. By doing this, you can gain more insight into whether the receiver is being called and what the state is during the call."
