I am working on an application running on a server, and I want system administrators to be able to modify a config file that would be detected during run time by the application. This would allow the log level to be changed dynamically. If this cannot be achieved through fileConfig, is there another method to accomplish the same result? I am currently working with gevent and have considered using inotify to detect changes to the config file."

        "content": "Yes, it is possible to dynamically change the log level in a Python application without restarting it. While `fileConfig` from the `logging.config` module can be used to configure logging from a configuration file, it doesn't inherently support dynamic reloading. However, you can achieve this functionality by combining it with a file monitoring mechanism, such as `inotify` on Linux, to detect changes to the configuration file.\n\nHere's a general approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Setup Logging Configuration**: Use `fileConfig` to initially configure your logging from a configuration file.\n\n2. **Monitor the Configuration File**: Use a file monitoring tool like `inotify` to watch for changes to your logging configuration file. If you're working in an environment where `inotify` is not available, you might consider using other libraries like `watchdog`, which is cross-platform.\n\n3. **Reload Configuration on Changes**: When a change in the configuration file is detected, reload the configuration using `fileConfig` again. This will update the logging configuration, including log levels, handlers, etc.\n\nHere's a basic example using `watchdog` to monitor the configuration file:\n\n```python\nimport time\nimport logging.config\nfrom watchdog.observers import Observer\nfrom watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler\n\n# Initial configuration\ndef setup_logging(config_file):\n    logging.config.fileConfig(config_file)\n    logging.info(\"Logging configured from {}\".format(config_file))\n\nclass ConfigFileChangeHandler(FileSystemEventHandler):\n    def __init__(self, config_file):\n        self.config_file = config_file\n\n    def on_modified(self, event):\n        if event.src_path == self.config_file:\n            logging.info(\"Configuration file changed, reloading logging config\")\n            setup_logging(self.config_file)\n\ndef monitor_config_file(config_file):\n    event_handler = ConfigFileChangeHandler(config_file)\n    observer = Observer()\n    observer.schedule(event_handler, path=config_file, recursive=False)\n    observer.start()\n    try:\n        while True:\n            time.sleep(1)\n    except KeyboardInterrupt:\n        observer.stop()\n    observer.join()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    config_file = 'logging.conf'\n    setup_logging(config_file)\n    monitor_config_file(config_file)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Watchdog**: This example uses the `watchdog` library to monitor the configuration file. You can install it via pip with `pip install watchdog`.\n\n- **Non-blocking Monitoring**: The `Observer` runs in a separate thread, so it won't block your application. You can integrate this into your main application loop or run it in a background thread/process.\n\n- **Cross-Platform**: Unlike `inotify`, which is Linux-specific, `watchdog` is cross-platform and supports file system events on Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\nBy using this setup, administrators can change the logging level or other logging configurations dynamically by editing the configuration file, and your application will pick up these changes without needing a restart."
