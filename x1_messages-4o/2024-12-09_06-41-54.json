The error is as follows: `ValueError: Error when checking target: expected dense_21 to have 3 dimensions, but got array with shape (90000, 16)`. What could be causing this error and how can I resolve it?"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering suggests that there's a mismatch between the expected shape of the target data and the shape of the data you're providing. Specifically, the model expects the target data to have 3 dimensions, but it's getting data with only 2 dimensions.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the problem and potential solutions:\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\n1. **Seq2Seq Model Output:**\n   - In a Seq2Seq model, especially at the word level, the output is typically a sequence of word predictions. If your model is generating sequences of words, the output shape is generally `(batch_size, sequence_length, num_classes)`. Here, `num_classes` is the size of your vocabulary, as each word is represented as one-hot encoded vectors or indices.\n\n2. **Current Target Shape:**\n   - Your current target shape is `(90000, 16)`, which suggests that you might be providing a 2D array where 90000 is the number of samples and 16 is the sequence length. However, it seems like the model is expecting an additional dimension for the vocabulary size.\n\n### Solutions\n\n1. **One-Hot Encoding:**\n   - If your target sequences are not already one-hot encoded, you need to convert them to one-hot representations. This means that each word in your target sequence should be represented as a one-hot vector with a length equal to the number of unique words in your vocabulary.\n\n2. **Reshape the Target Data:**\n   - If your targets are indices instead of one-hot vectors, you might need to use the `to_categorical` function from Keras to convert them into one-hot encoded format. This will add the third dimension that the model is expecting.\n\n   ```python\n   from keras.utils import to_categorical\n\n   # Assuming `y_train` is your target data with shape (90000, 16)\n   num_classes = ... # Set this to your vocabulary size\n   y_train = to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=num_classes)\n   ```\n\n3. **Adjust Model Architecture:**\n   - Ensure that the final layer of your Seq2Seq model uses a `Dense` layer with `num_classes` units and a softmax activation. This will ensure that the model outputs a probability distribution over the vocabulary for each word in the sequence.\n\n   ```python\n   model.add(Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax'))\n   ```\n\n4. **Check Model Configuration:**\n   - Double-check your model's architecture to ensure that the input and output shapes are consistent with your data, especially focusing on any reshaping or dense layers.\n\nBy ensuring that your target data is properly shaped and encoded, you should be able to resolve the dimension mismatch error."
