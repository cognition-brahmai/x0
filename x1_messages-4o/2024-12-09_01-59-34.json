        "content": "The import error you're seeing is likely due to Python's module search path not including the directory where `app.py` is located. When using mod_wsgi, you need to make sure that the directory containing your application is included in the Python path. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Set the Python Path in `wsgi.py`:** You can manually add the directory to the Python path by modifying the `wsgi.py` file to include the following lines at the top of the file:\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   import os\n\n   # Add the app's directory to the PYTHONPATH\n   sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(__file__))\n   ```\n\n   This ensures that the directory containing your `app.py` is added to the Python path so that it can be found when the import statement is executed.\n\n2. **Verify Directory Structure and File Permissions:** Ensure that the directory structure is exactly as expected and that all files, especially `wsgi.py`, have the correct permissions set. The Apache user needs to have at least read access to these files.\n\n3. **Check the `__init__.py` File:** Make sure there's an `__init__.py` file in the `/flaskfirst/` directory. This file can be empty, but it must exist for Python to recognize the directory as a package.\n\n4. **Verify Apache Configuration:** Double-check your Apache configuration to ensure there are no typos or misconfigurations in the file paths.\n\n5. **Virtual Environment (Optional):** If you're using a virtual environment, make sure it's activated and properly configured within your Apache setup. You may need to specify the path to the virtual environment's Python interpreter in your Apache configuration.\n\n6. **Restart Apache:** After making these changes, don\u2019t forget to restart the Apache server to apply the updates:\n   \n   ```bash\n   sudo service apache2 restart\n   ```\n\nBy ensuring that the Python path is correctly set, and checking the directory structure and file permissions, you should be able to resolve the import error and get your Flask application running successfully under Apache with mod_wsgi."
