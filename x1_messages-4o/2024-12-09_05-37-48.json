I have a 2D array, for example:\n\n```python\ntheArray = [['a','b','c'],['d','e','f'],['g','h','i']]\n```\n\nI want my function to transpose this array to:\n\n```python\nnewArray = [['a','d','g'],['b','e','h'],['c', 'f', 'i']]\n```\n\nIn other words, I want the rows to be turned into columns and vice versa. However, the function I have created so far isn't working:\n\n```python\ndef matrixTranspose(anArray):\n    transposed = [None]*len(anArray[0])\n    for t in range(len(anArray)):\n        for tt in range(len(anArray[t])):\n            transposed[t] = [None]*len(anArray)\n            transposed[t][tt] = anArray[tt][t]\n    print transposed\n```"

        "content": "To transpose a matrix in Python, you can use a more straightforward approach by leveraging list comprehension. Your current function has some issues with index assignments and initialization of the `transposed` list. Here's a corrected version of your function:\n\n```python\ndef matrixTranspose(anArray):\n    transposed = [[anArray[j][i] for j in range(len(anArray))] for i in range(len(anArray[0]))]\n    return transposed\n\ntheArray = [['a','b','c'],['d','e','f'],['g','h','i']]\nnewArray = matrixTranspose(theArray)\nprint(newArray)\n```\n\nThis code works as follows:\n1. `transposed = [[anArray[j][i] for j in range(len(anArray))] for i in range(len(anArray[0]))]` creates a new transposed matrix using list comprehension.\n2. The outer loop iterates over columns (`i`), and the inner loop iterates over rows (`j`).\n3. This swaps the rows and columns by accessing `anArray[j][i]` and constructing the new transposed matrix.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n```\n[['a', 'd', 'g'], ['b', 'e', 'h'], ['c', 'f', 'i']]\n```\n\nThis is the transposed version of your original matrix."
