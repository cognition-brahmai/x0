However, I'm getting a `SystemError: new style getargs format but argument is not a tuple` error message. What could be the problem?"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering, `SystemError: new style getargs format but argument is not a tuple`, typically indicates that there's an issue with the arguments being passed to the `cv2.line` function. This error often occurs when the function is expecting a particular format for its arguments, but something else is provided instead.\n\nHere are a few things to check and potentially fix in your code:\n\n1. **Ensure `output` is a valid image matrix**: \n   - Make sure that `output` is a valid image matrix (e.g., a NumPy array) where the line will be drawn. If `output` is not properly initialized as an image, the function call will fail.\n\n2. **Check the data types of `point1` and `point2`**:\n   - `point1` and `point2` should be tuples of integers representing the coordinates of the start and end points of the line. For example, `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.\n   - Ensure they are tuples and contain integer values, not lists or any other data types.\n\n3. **Verify the color and thickness arguments**:\n   - The color `(0, 0, 255)` should be a tuple of integers representing the BGR color values.\n   - The thickness `5` should be an integer.\n\nHere's a checklist to correct these issues:\n\n```python\nimport cv2\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Example initialization of output, point1, and point2\noutput = np.zeros((400, 400, 3), dtype=np.uint8)  # Example image\npoint1 = (50, 50)  # Example start point\npoint2 = (200, 200)  # Example end point\n\n# Ensure points are tuples of integers\npoint1 = tuple(map(int, point1))\npoint2 = tuple(map(int, point2))\n\n# Draw the line\ncv2.line(output, point1, point2, (0, 0, 255), 5)\n```\n\nBy ensuring that all arguments are of the correct type and format, the error should be resolved. If you continue to experience issues, consider printing the types and values of each variable to debug further."
