The package name does appear when I run `pip freeze`, however, when I try to import the package, I get an error saying `No module named <package>`. Furthermore, I noticed that the site-packages folder only contains a dist-info folder. I have confirmed that `find_packages()` is able to find my packages. What am I missing in this process? Here is the code that I used:\n\n```python\nimport io\nimport os\nimport sys\nfrom shutil import rmtree\n\nfrom setuptools import find_packages, setup, Command\n\nNAME = '<package>'\nDESCRIPTION = 'description'\nURL = ''\nEMAIL = 'email'\nAUTHOR = 'name'\n\nREQUIRED = []\n\nhere = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))\n\nsetup(\n    name=NAME,\n    description=DESCRIPTION,\n    author=AUTHOR,\n    author_email=EMAIL,\n    url=URL,\n    packages=find_packages(),\n    install_requires=REQUIRED,\n    include_package_data=True,\n    license='MIT',\n    classifiers=[\n        'License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License',\n        'Programming Language :: Python',\n        'Programming Language :: Python :: 2.6',\n        'Programming Language :: Python :: 2.7',\n        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3',\n        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.3',\n        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.4',\n        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.5',\n        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.6',\n        'Programming Language :: Python :: Implementation :: CPython',\n        'Programming Language :: Python :: Implementation :: PyPy'\n    ],\n)\n```"

        "content": "It looks like you're on the right track with creating a Python package, but there might be a few common issues that could cause the problem you're experiencing:\n\n1. **Directory Structure**: Ensure that your package has the correct directory structure. For example, if your package name is `<package>`, your directory should look like this:\n\n    ```\n    <root_directory>/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 <package>/\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 other_module.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 setup.py\n    ```\n\n   The `__init__.py` file is crucial as it tells Python that the directory should be treated as a package.\n\n2. **Package Name**: Double-check the `NAME` variable in your `setup.py`. It should be the name you want your package to have, and it should match the directory name that contains your package modules.\n\n3. **`find_packages()`**: This function should correctly find your package if it's structured properly. If you have sub-packages, make sure they also have their own `__init__.py` files.\n\n4. **Python Environment**: Ensure that you're installing the package in the correct Python environment. Sometimes, issues can arise if the environment you're using to install the package is different from the one you're using to run the script.\n\n5. **Installation Command**: When you run `pip install .`, make sure you're inside the root directory where `setup.py` is located.\n\n6. **Check for Typos**: Ensure there are no typos in the package name when you try to import it.\n\n7. **Verbose Installation**: Run the installation command with verbose output to check for any warnings or errors that might provide additional clues:\n\n    ```shell\n    pip install . -v\n    ```\n\nIf everything seems correct and it still doesn't work, try the following:\n\n- Clean the build directories by deleting any `build`, `dist`, or `*.egg-info` directories, and then run the installation again.\n- If you're using a virtual environment, try deactivating and reactivating it, or create a new one to see if the problem persists.\n\nIf you've checked all these and still face issues, consider sharing more detailed information about the directory structure and any error messages you encounter."
