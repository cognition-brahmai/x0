        "content": "Certainly! Analyzing social media trends involves understanding user behavior, engagement metrics, content types, and platform-specific features. Here are five unique SQL queries designed to challenge logical reasoning and provide insights into social media trends in 2020 across different platforms:\n\n### Query 1: Identify the Most Engaged Content Type Across Platforms\nThis query calculates the content type with the highest average engagement (likes, comments, shares) across all platforms.\n\n```sql\nSELECT content_type, \n       AVG(likes + comments + shares) AS avg_engagement\nFROM social_media_data\nWHERE year = 2020\nGROUP BY content_type\nORDER BY avg_engagement DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\n### Query 2: Determine the Peak Posting Time for Each Platform\nThis query finds the time of day with the highest average number of posts for each platform.\n\n```sql\nSELECT platform, \n       HOUR(post_time) AS peak_hour, \n       COUNT(post_id) AS num_posts\nFROM social_media_data\nWHERE year = 2020\nGROUP BY platform, peak_hour\nORDER BY platform, num_posts DESC;\n```\n\n### Query 3: Find Influencers with Rapid Follower Growth\nThis query identifies users who had the largest percentage increase in followers within the year.\n\n```sql\nSELECT user_id, \n       (MAX(followers) - MIN(followers)) / MIN(followers) * 100 AS growth_percentage\nFROM social_media_data\nWHERE year = 2020\nGROUP BY user_id\nHAVING growth_percentage > 50\nORDER BY growth_percentage DESC;\n```\n\n### Query 4: Analyze Cross-Platform User Activity\nThis query identifies users who are highly active on multiple platforms, defined by posting on at least three different platforms.\n\n```sql\nSELECT user_id, \n       COUNT(DISTINCT platform) AS distinct_platforms\nFROM social_media_data\nWHERE year = 2020\nGROUP BY user_id\nHAVING distinct_platforms >= 3;\n```\n\n### Query 5: Assess the Impact of Hashtags on Engagement\nThis query examines whether posts with hashtags had higher engagement compared to those without.\n\n```sql\nSELECT has_hashtag, \n       AVG(likes + comments + shares) AS avg_engagement\nFROM (\n    SELECT post_id, \n           (CASE WHEN hashtags IS NOT NULL AND hashtags != '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_hashtag, \n           likes, comments, shares\n    FROM social_media_data\n    WHERE year = 2020\n) AS hashtag_analysis\nGROUP BY has_hashtag;\n```\n\nThese queries leverage logical reasoning by requiring analysis of various dimensions such as time, content type, and user behavior across multiple social media platforms. They challenge the user to think critically about how data is interconnected and what insights can be gleaned from it."
