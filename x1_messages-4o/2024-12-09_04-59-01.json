I end up with a long list of errors, culminating in `error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1`. When I checked `/root/.pip/pip.log`, I found this message: `InstallationError: Command /usr/local/bin/python -c \"import setuptools; file='/home/build/pyodbc/setup.py'; execfile('/home/build/pyodbc/setup.py')\" install --single-version-externally-managed --record /tmp/pip-7MS9Vu-record/install-record.txt failed with error code 1`. Has anyone encountered a similar problem when installing pyodbc?"

        "content": "The error message you're seeing, particularly the `error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1`, typically indicates that there are missing dependencies required for compiling the `pyodbc` module. Here are some steps you can follow to resolve this issue on your CentOS system:\n\n1. **Install Development Tools**: Make sure you have all the necessary development tools installed, including `gcc` and `make`. You can install them by running:\n   ```bash\n   sudo yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Python Development Headers**: You might be missing the Python development headers, which are required to build Python extensions.\n   ```bash\n   sudo yum install python-devel\n   ```\n\n3. **Install UnixODBC Development Package**: PyODBC relies on the UnixODBC driver manager, so you need to have its development files installed.\n   ```bash\n   sudo yum install unixODBC-devel\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify Python and Pip Installation**: Ensure that Python and pip are correctly installed and up to date. Sometimes using a virtual environment can help avoid conflicts with system packages.\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   pip --version\n   ```\n\n5. **Try Reinstalling pyodbc**: Once you have confirmed that all dependencies are installed, try reinstalling `pyodbc`.\n   ```bash\n   pip install pyodbc\n   ```\n\n6. **Check for Specific Errors**: If the installation fails again, look carefully at the error messages for any specific missing files or libraries.\n\n7. **Consider Using a Different Python Version**: If you're using an older version of Python or CentOS, consider using a more recent version of Python (e.g., through `pyenv` or by compiling from source) as it may have better support for newer packages.\n\nIf you encounter any specific errors after following these steps, feel free to provide the details, and I can help troubleshoot further."
