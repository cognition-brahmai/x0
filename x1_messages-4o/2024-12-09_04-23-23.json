In Python 2.7, the `__sizeof__` method returns the same object size for both `True` and `False` (24), as shown below:\n\n```python\n>>> False.__sizeof__()\n24\n>>> True.__sizeof__()\n24\n```\n\nHowever, in Python 3.x, the `__sizeof__` method returns the object size of `False` as 24, but `True` has an object size of 28.\n\n```python\n>>> False.__sizeof__()\n24\n>>> True.__sizeof__()\n28\n```\n\nI am curious as to what changes were made in Python 3 that resulted in the size of `True` being greater than the size of `False`?"

        "content": "In Python 2, the boolean type is essentially a subclass of integers, with `True` and `False` being singleton instances of that type. Both of these boolean values have the same size because they are essentially represented as integers under the hood, with `False` being equivalent to `0` and `True` being equivalent to `1`.\n\nIn Python 3, the implementation of boolean values remains conceptually similar, with `bool` still being a subclass of `int`. However, the change in the size of `True` compared to `False` that you observed is likely due to differences in the internal representation or memory alignment of these objects within the Python 3 interpreter. \n\nThe difference in size for `True` and `False` could be attributed to a few possible reasons:\n\n1. **Memory Alignment**: Python's object model and memory allocation strategies might cause slight differences in memory alignment or padding for small integer objects, leading to different sizes.\n\n2. **Internal Optimizations**: The Python 3 interpreter might have different optimizations or memory layouts for singleton objects like `True` and `False`, possibly affecting their memory footprint.\n\n3. **Garbage Collector Metadata**: The difference might also be due to additional metadata or flags used by Python 3's garbage collector or memory management system that are not present in Python 2 or vary between these singleton objects.\n\nWhile the exact reason might require a deep dive into the CPython source code and memory management mechanisms, these explanations cover the general reasons why such a difference might exist. It's important to note that such internal details are usually abstracted away from the user level and are subject to change between different Python versions and implementations."
