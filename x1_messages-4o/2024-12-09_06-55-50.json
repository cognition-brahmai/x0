        "content": "The short-circuit behavior of Python's `any()` and `all()` functions is indeed part of their documented behavior, and it is explicit. The official Python documentation provides equivalent code to illustrate how these functions work, and this equivalent code includes short-circuit logic.\n\nFor `any()`, the function returns `True` as soon as it encounters the first `True` value in the iterable. For `all()`, it returns `False` as soon as it encounters the first `False` value. This short-circuiting is a crucial part of their design, ensuring efficiency by not evaluating the remaining elements once the result is determined.\n\nWhile the Python documentation may not explicitly state \"short-circuit\" in the descriptions, the provided equivalent code implies this behavior. This behavior can be considered part of the function's definition, and any compliant implementation of Python should adhere to it.\n\nThe CPython test suite, such as `test_builtin.py`, may not explicitly enforce this behavior with specific tests, but it is generally expected that any implementation of Python will follow the documented behavior, including short-circuiting. If a Python implementation did not use short-circuiting, it would likely be considered a deviation from expected behavior and could lead to inefficiencies or incorrect results in certain use cases."
