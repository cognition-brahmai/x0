However, this only prints lines with matches and I'd like to see the entire file with the pattern matches highlighted. Is there a way to make `grep` print every line being read regardless of whether there's a match, without having to write a script to run grep on every line of a file?"

        "content": "Certainly! While `grep` typically shows only the lines that match a pattern, you can achieve your goal by using `grep` in combination with other commands. One approach is to use `cat` to display the entire file and `grep` to highlight the matches. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```bash\ncat yourfile.txt | grep --color=always -E 'pattern|$'\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `cat yourfile.txt` outputs every line of the file.\n- `grep --color=always -E 'pattern|$'`:\n  - `--color=always`: Highlights the matches.\n  - `-E`: Enables extended regular expressions, allowing you to use the `|` operator.\n  - `'pattern|$'`: Matches either the specified pattern or the end of the line (`$`). This ensures every line is processed by `grep`, allowing it to highlight matches while outputting every line.\n\nThis combination effectively highlights the pattern throughout the entire file while displaying all lines."
