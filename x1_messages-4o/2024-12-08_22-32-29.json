        "content": "In LaTeX, you can write the law of gravitation using standard mathematical notation. The law of gravitation is often expressed as:\n\n\\[ F = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\]\n\nHere's how you can include it in your LaTeX document:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\nThe law of gravitation is given by:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nF = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\( F \\) is the gravitational force between two objects,\n    \\item \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant,\n    \\item \\( m_1 \\) and \\( m_2 \\) are the masses of the two objects,\n    \\item \\( r \\) is the distance between the centers of the two objects.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n### Parameters in the Equation:\n\n- \\( F \\): The gravitational force between two objects. It is a vector quantity and its magnitude is given by the formula.\n- \\( G \\): The gravitational constant, approximately \\( 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{Nm}^2/\\text{kg}^2 \\).\n- \\( m_1 \\) and \\( m_2 \\): The masses of the two objects experiencing the gravitational force.\n- \\( r \\): The distance between the centers of masses of the two objects.\n\nThis code will display the law of gravitation equation with a brief explanation of each parameter. You can compile this using any LaTeX editor such as Overleaf or TeXShop."
