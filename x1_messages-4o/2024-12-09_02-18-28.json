If I have two threading.Event() objects and I want to make the thread sleep until either one of them is set, is there a way to efficiently do this? I'm trying to avoid a polling/timeout solution and would like to truly have the thread sleep until one is set, similar to how 'select' is used for file descriptors. What would an efficient non-polling implementation of 'wait_for_either' look like in the following code?\n\n```python\na = threading.Event()\nb = threading.Event()\n\nwait_for_either(a, b)\n```"

        "content": "Python's `threading` module does not provide a built-in way to wait on multiple `Event` objects like the `select` function does for file descriptors. However, you can achieve similar functionality by using a combination of threading and synchronization primitives.\n\nOne approach is to use a single `threading.Condition` object to coordinate the waiting. You can create a helper function to wait for either event by using a separate thread that sets a condition variable when one of the events is set. Here's how you might implement such functionality:\n\n```python\nimport threading\n\ndef wait_for_either(event1, event2):\n    condition = threading.Condition()\n    result = []\n\n    def wait_on_event(event):\n        event.wait()\n        with condition:\n            result.append(event)\n            condition.notify()\n\n    # Start threads to wait on each event\n    threading.Thread(target=wait_on_event, args=(event1,)).start()\n    threading.Thread(target=wait_on_event, args=(event2,)).start()\n\n    # Wait for either event to be set\n    with condition:\n        while not result:\n            condition.wait()\n\n    # Return the event that was set\n    return result[0]\n\n# Example usage\na = threading.Event()\nb = threading.Event()\n\n# In some other thread(s), you might set the events\n# a.set() or b.set()\n\n# Wait for either event to be set\ntriggered_event = wait_for_either(a, b)\nprint(f\"Event {triggered_event} was set.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Condition Variable**: A `Condition` allows one or more threads to wait until they are notified. We use it here to wait until one of the events is set.\n2. **Separate Threads**: We start a separate thread for each `Event` to wait on it. When an event is set, it appends itself to the `result` list and notifies the condition variable.\n3. **Main Thread Waits**: The main thread waits on the condition variable. When it is notified (meaning one of the events was set), it checks which event was set and returns it.\n\nThis method provides true blocking without polling and efficiently waits for one of the events to be set."
