However, when I attempt to use `func.sum` with `Services.query`, I encounter a `TypeError: BaseQuery object is not callable`. How can I effectively query using a function in Flask-SQLAlchemy? Here is the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nServices.query(func.sum(Services.price)).filter(Services.dateAdd.between(start, end))\n```"

        "content": "In Flask-SQLAlchemy, the `BaseQuery` object is not directly callable with functions like `func.sum`. Instead, you should use the `session.query` method to perform such operations. The `session.query` method is used to construct a query that can include aggregate functions like `func.sum`.\n\nHere is how you can modify your code to correctly perform the query and sum the prices between two dates:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import func\nfrom your_application import db  # Make sure to import your db instance\n\ntotal_price = db.session.query(func.sum(Services.price)).filter(Services.dateAdd.between(start, end)).scalar()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Use `db.session.query`:** To use aggregate functions like `func.sum`, start the query with `db.session.query()` instead of `Services.query`.\n\n2. **Pass the aggregate function:** Pass `func.sum(Services.price)` as an argument to `db.session.query()`.\n\n3. **Filter the results:** Use the `filter()` method to apply the date range condition.\n\n4. **Retrieve the result:** Use `.scalar()` at the end to get the single aggregated value from the query result.\n\nThis should resolve the `TypeError` and give you the total sum of prices for services between the specified dates."
