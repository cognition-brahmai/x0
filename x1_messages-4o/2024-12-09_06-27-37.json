My images are of size 192x192 and I want to crop the center of them so that the output batches will be 150x150 or something similar. However, I do not believe this can be done directly in Keras ImageDataGenerator because the target_size argument in the datagenerator seems to alter the images. I have modified the crop as shown in the code below, but this solution is slow. Is there a more efficient way to achieve this?\n\n```python\ndef my_crop(img, random_crop_size):\n  if K.image_data_format() == 'channels_last':\n    assert img.shape[2] == 3\n    height, width = img.shape[0], img.shape[1]\n    dy, dx = random_crop_size #input desired output size\n    start_y = (height-dy)//2\n    start_x = (width-dx)//2\n    return img[start_y:start_y+dy, start_x:(dx+start_x), :]\n  else:\n      assert img.shape[0] == 3\n      height, width = img.shape[1], img.shape[2]\n      dy, dx = random_crop_size  # input desired output size\n      start_y = (height - dy) // 2\n      start_x = (width - dx) // 2\n      return img[:,start_y:start_y + dy, start_x:(dx + start_x)]\n\ndef crop_generator(batches, crop_length):\n    while True:\n        batch_x, batch_y = next(batches)\n        if K.image_data_format() == 'channels_last':\n         batch_crops = np.zeros((batch_x.shape[0], crop_length, crop_length, 3))\n        else:\n         batch_crops = np.zeros((batch_x.shape[0], 3, crop_length, crop_length))\n        for i in range(batch_x.shape[0]):\n            batch_crops[i] = my_crop(batch_x[i], (crop_length, crop_length))\n        yield (batch_crops, batch_y)\n```"

        "content": "Cropping images efficiently while using Keras' `ImageDataGenerator` can indeed be a bit tricky, since `ImageDataGenerator` is designed primarily for data augmentation rather than cropping. However, there are a few strategies you can implement to improve efficiency:\n\n1. **Preprocessing Function**: Use the `preprocessing_function` parameter in `ImageDataGenerator` to apply your custom cropping function. This can be done directly on the images as they're being loaded.\n\n2. **Custom Data Generator**: If the above option doesn't provide the speed you need, consider writing a custom data generator that handles loading and cropping images efficiently.\n\nHere's how you can use the `preprocessing_function`:\n\n```python\nfrom keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator\nimport numpy as np\nimport keras.backend as K\n\ndef my_crop(img):\n    if K.image_data_format() == 'channels_last':\n        assert img.shape[2] == 3\n        height, width = img.shape[0], img.shape[1]\n        crop_height, crop_width = 150, 150\n        start_y = (height - crop_height) // 2\n        start_x = (width - crop_width) // 2\n        return img[start_y:start_y + crop_height, start_x:start_x + crop_width, :]\n    else:\n        assert img.shape[0] == 3\n        height, width = img.shape[1], img.shape[2]\n        crop_height, crop_width = 150, 150\n        start_y = (height - crop_height) // 2\n        start_x = (width - crop_width) // 2\n        return img[:, start_y:start_y + crop_height, start_x:start_x + crop_width]\n\ndatagen = ImageDataGenerator(preprocessing_function=my_crop)\n\n# Use the datagen as you normally would, e.g., with flow_from_directory\ntrain_generator = datagen.flow_from_directory(\n    'data/train',\n    target_size=(192, 192),  # Original image size\n    batch_size=32,\n    class_mode='binary')\n\n# Now `train_generator` will yield cropped images of size 150x150.\n```\n\nThis approach leverages the `preprocessing_function` to apply the cropping directly as each image is processed. This should be more efficient than applying the cropping in a separate loop after the images have been loaded.\n\n3. **Parallel Processing**: If you're still facing performance issues, consider using parallel processing or leveraging GPU capabilities to speed up the image processing tasks.\n\nBy employing these strategies, you should be able to achieve faster cropping of images while maintaining integration with Keras' `ImageDataGenerator`."
