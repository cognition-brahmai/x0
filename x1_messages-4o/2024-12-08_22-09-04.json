        "content": "To prove that the sum of the angles in a triangle is equal to 180 degrees, we can use a straightforward geometric argument involving parallel lines. Here's a step-by-step proof:\n\nConsider a triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\).\n\n1. Draw a line through point \\( C \\) that is parallel to the line segment \\( AB \\).\n2. Let this line intersect extensions of lines \\( AC \\) and \\( BC \\) at points \\( D \\) and \\( E \\) respectively.\n\nNow, we have a transversal \\( AC \\) crossing the parallel lines \\( AB \\) and \\( DE \\).\n\n3. By the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem, the angle \\( \\angle DAC \\) is equal to the angle \\( \\angle ACB \\) because they are alternate interior angles.\n4. Similarly, the angle \\( \\angle EBC \\) is equal to the angle \\( \\angle ABC \\).\n\nNow consider the straight line \\( DE \\).\n\n5. The angles \\( \\angle DAC \\), \\( \\angle ACB \\), and \\( \\angle EBC \\) form a straight line, so their sum is \\( 180^\\circ \\).\n\nThus, we can write:\n\\[ \n\\angle DAC + \\angle ACB + \\angle EBC = 180^\\circ \n\\]\n\nSubstituting the equivalent angles from the triangle, we get:\n\\[\n\\angle CAB + \\angle ABC + \\angle BCA = 180^\\circ \n\\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of the angles in a triangle is \\( 180^\\circ \\).\n\nThis proof relies on the parallel postulate and the properties of alternate interior angles, both fundamental concepts in Euclidean geometry."
