I have looked into the Google API and attempted to use `drive_service` and `MedioIO` but it requires credentials that I'm unsure of how to use, specifically a JSON `file/OAuth`. I've attempted to use `urllib2.urlretrieve` and `wget` but to no avail. I have also tried the `PyDrive` library which seems to only have upload functionality but no download options."

        "content": "To download files from Google Drive using a URL in Python, you need to authenticate with the Google Drive API. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this using the `google-api-python-client` and `google-auth` libraries:\n\n1. **Set Up a Google Cloud Project:**\n   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).\n   - Create a new project.\n   - Navigate to \"APIs & Services\" > \"Library\" and enable the Google Drive API.\n   - Go to \"Credentials\" and click \"Create Credentials\" > \"OAuth client ID\".\n   - Configure the consent screen and choose \"Desktop app\" as the application type.\n   - Download the credentials JSON file.\n\n2. **Install Required Libraries:**\n   You need to install the following Python libraries:\n   ```bash\n   pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client\n   ```\n\n3. **Authenticate and Download Files:**\n   Use the following script to authenticate and download files:\n\n   ```python\n   from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials\n   from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow\n   from google.auth.transport.requests import Request\n   from googleapiclient.discovery import build\n   import os.path\n   import io\n   from googleapiclient.http import MediaIoBaseDownload\n\n   # If modifying these SCOPES, delete the file token.json.\n   SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly']\n\n   def main():\n       creds = None\n       # The file token.json stores the user's access and refresh tokens, and is\n       # created automatically when the authorization flow completes for the first\n       # time.\n       if os.path.exists('token.json'):\n           creds = Credentials.from_authorized_user_file('token.json', SCOPES)\n       # If there are no (valid) credentials available, let the user log in.\n       if not creds or not creds.valid:\n           if creds and creds.expired and creds.refresh_token:\n               creds.refresh(Request())\n           else:\n               flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file(\n                   'credentials.json', SCOPES)\n               creds = flow.run_local_server(port=0)\n           # Save the credentials for the next run\n           with open('token.json', 'w') as token:\n               token.write(creds.to_json())\n\n       # Call the Drive API\n       service = build('drive', 'v3', credentials=creds)\n\n       file_id = 'your_file_id_here'  # Replace with your file's ID\n       request = service.files().get_media(fileId=file_id)\n       fh = io.BytesIO()\n       downloader = MediaIoBaseDownload(fh, request)\n       done = False\n       while done is False:\n           status, done = downloader.next_chunk()\n           print(f\"Download {int(status.progress() * 100)}.\")\n\n       # Write the file to disk\n       with open('your_file_name_here', 'wb') as f:\n           f.write(fh.getbuffer())\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       main()\n   ```\n\n4. **Get File ID from Google Drive URL:**\n   When you have a Google Drive URL, the file ID is the part of the URL after `/d/` and before `/view`. For example, in `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I/view?usp=sharing`, the file ID is `1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I`.\n\n5. **Replace `your_file_id_here` and `your_file_name_here`:**\n   Replace `your_file_id_here` with the actual file ID obtained from the URL, and `your_file_name_here` with the desired name for the downloaded file.\n\nThis script sets up OAuth2 authentication, retrieves the desired file from your Google Drive, and saves it locally. The OAuth flow will open a browser window for you to log in with your Google account and authorize the app. After authorization, it saves the credentials for future use in `token.json`."
