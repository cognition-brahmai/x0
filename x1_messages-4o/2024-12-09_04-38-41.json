I've been using it for string equality checks like so:\n\n```\n>>> s = 'str'\n>>> s is 'str'\nTrue\n>>> s is 'st'\nFalse\n```\n\nHowever, when I try to create my own classes and override the `__is__()` or `__eq__()` methods, it doesn't seem to work. For example:\n\n```\n>>> class MyString:\n...   def __init__(self):\n...     self.s = 'string'\n...   def __is__(self, s):\n...     return self.s == s\n...\n>>> m = MyString()\n>>> m is 'ss'\nFalse\n>>> m is 'string' # <--- Expected to work\nFalse\n```\n\nIn this example, I expected `m is 'string'` to return `True`, but it returns `False`. Similarly, when I try to override `__eq__()`, I get the same result:\n\n```\n>>> class MyString:\n...   def __init__(self):\n...     self.s = 'string'\n...   def __eq__(self, s):\n...     return self.s == s\n...\n>>> m = MyString()\n>>> m is 'ss'\nFalse\n>>> m is 'string' # <--- Expected to work, but again failed\nFalse\n```\n\nCan you help me understand why this is happening and how to properly implement this?"

        "content": "Certainly! The confusion here arises from a misunderstanding of the `is` keyword in Python and how object identity works.\n\n### Understanding the `is` Keyword\n\nThe `is` keyword in Python checks for **identity**, not equality. It determines whether two variables point to the same object in memory. It does not use any special method like `__is__()` for this purpose, because it's fundamentally about comparing memory addresses.\n\n### Why `is` Works for Some Strings\n\nIn Python, small strings and some other immutable objects are sometimes interned, meaning that they are stored in a way that allows the same object to be reused. This is why you might see `s is 'str'` return `True` for small strings, but this is an implementation detail and not something to rely on for string comparison.\n\n### Correct Approach for Equality\n\nIf you want to compare objects for equality based on their content or properties, you should use the `==` operator, which can be customized with the `__eq__()` method.\n\nHere's how you can implement it correctly in your custom class:\n\n```python\nclass MyString:\n    def __init__(self, s):\n        self.s = s\n\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        if isinstance(other, MyString):\n            return self.s == other.s\n        if isinstance(other, str):\n            return self.s == other\n        return False\n\n# Usage\nm = MyString('string')\nprint(m == 'string')  # True\nprint(m == 'ss')      # False\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n- Use `==` for equality checks and implement `__eq__()` if you need custom behavior.\n- Use `is` only if you need to check if two variables refer to the same object (not usually needed for strings or custom classes unless specifically required for identity checks).\n- There is no `__is__()` method in Python.\n\nBy implementing `__eq__()`, you can control how equality is determined for instances of your class."
