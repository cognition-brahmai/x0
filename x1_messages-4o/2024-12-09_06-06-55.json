So far, I've managed to set the browser size after it's created using the following code:\n\n```python\ndriver = webdriver.Firefox()\ndriver.set_window_size(1080,800)\n```\nHowever, I would like to know if there is a way to set the width and height at instantiation itself. I assume it's something along the lines of the code below, but I'm not sure what to replace `foo` with and I can't find the relevant documentation.\n\n```python\nprofile = webdriver.FirefoxProfile();\nprofile.set_preference(foo, 1080)\ndriver = webdriver.Firefox(profile)\n```\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Is there a way to set width / height at instantiation?\n2. Where can I find the reference documentation listing all keys usable by `profile.set_preference`?"

        "content": "To set the browser width and height at the time of instantiation with Selenium WebDriver, you can utilize the `Options` or `DesiredCapabilities` classes, depending on the browser you're using. For Firefox, unfortunately, there is no direct method to set the window size during instantiation via profile preferences. However, you can use the `moz:firefoxOptions` capabilities to specify the desired size. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Firefox\n\nTo set the window size during initialization, you can use the `add_argument` method from `FirefoxOptions`:\n\n```python\nfrom selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options\n\noptions = Options()\noptions.add_argument(\"--width=1080\")\noptions.add_argument(\"--height=800\")\n\ndriver = webdriver.Firefox(options=options)\n```\n\n### Chrome\n\nIn case you are interested in how it works with Chrome, here is how you can set the window size:\n\n```python\nfrom selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options\n\noptions = Options()\noptions.add_argument(\"window-size=1080,800\")\n\ndriver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)\n```\n\n### Reference Documentation\n\nFor Firefox, there isn't a specific list of `profile.set_preference` keys available in the Selenium documentation. However, the preferences you can set are essentially the same as the ones you can configure in the `about:config` page of Firefox. You can also refer to the [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Preferences/Preference_reference) for a comprehensive list of preferences.\n\nFor more detailed documentation on Selenium options and capabilities for different browsers, you can check the official Selenium [documentation](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/) and the specific browser driver documentation (e.g., [GeckoDriver for Firefox](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/testing/geckodriver/index.html)).\n\nThese approaches should help you set the browser window size at the point of instantiation using Selenium WebDriver for different browsers."
