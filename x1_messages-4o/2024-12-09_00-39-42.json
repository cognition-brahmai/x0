The best I could come up with is `print '%8s %8s %8s' % (tuple(\"date price ret\".split()))`. I am wondering if there's a more elegant or efficient way to do this in Python?"

        "content": "Certainly! In Python, you have a few options to achieve similar functionality with string formatting. One of the most popular and modern ways is by using f-strings (formatted string literals), which were introduced in Python 3.6. Here are a few ways you can do this in Python:\n\n### Using f-strings (Python 3.6+)\n```python\ndata = [\"date\", \"price\", \"ret\"]\nformatted_string = f\"{data[0]:>8} {data[1]:>8} {data[2]:>8}\"\nprint(formatted_string)\n```\n\n### Using the `str.format()` method\n```python\nformatted_string = \"{:>8} {:>8} {:>8}\".format(\"date\", \"price\", \"ret\")\nprint(formatted_string)\n```\n\n### Using the `%` operator (old-style, similar to your approach)\n```python\nformatted_string = \"%8s %8s %8s\" % (\"date\", \"price\", \"ret\")\nprint(formatted_string)\n```\n\nEach of these methods allows you to specify the width and alignment of the strings, similar to what you did in Perl. The `>` in `{:>8}` specifies right alignment within 8 spaces, akin to `%8s` in your Perl code. Choose the method that you find most readable and convenient for your use case."
