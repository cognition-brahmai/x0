        "content": "An object is said to be in equilibrium when the net force and net torque acting on it are zero. This ensures that the object is either at rest or moving with a constant velocity, meaning there is no acceleration. The process of achieving equilibrium can be understood through two main conditions: translational equilibrium and rotational equilibrium.\n\n1. **Translational Equilibrium**:\n   - **Net Force is Zero**: For an object to be in translational equilibrium, the sum of all the forces acting on it must be zero. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n     \\[\n     \\sum \\vec{F} = 0\n     \\]\n   - This implies that all the forces acting along each axis (usually x, y, and z) cancel each other out. For example, if there are forces acting in opposite directions, they must be equal in magnitude for the object to remain in equilibrium.\n\n2. **Rotational Equilibrium**:\n   - **Net Torque is Zero**: For rotational equilibrium, the sum of all torques acting on the object must be zero. Torque is the rotational equivalent of force and depends on the force applied, the distance from the pivot point (lever arm), and the angle of application. This is expressed as:\n     \\[\n     \\sum \\tau = 0\n     \\]\n   - Like forces, torques that cause clockwise rotation must be balanced by torques that cause counterclockwise rotation.\n\n3. **Static vs. Dynamic Equilibrium**:\n   - **Static Equilibrium**: When an object is at rest and remains at rest, it is in static equilibrium. This means both net forces and net torques are zero, and there is no movement.\n   - **Dynamic Equilibrium**: When an object is moving with constant velocity (both linear and angular) and not accelerating, it is in dynamic equilibrium.\n\n4. **Practical Considerations**:\n   - To analyze equilibrium, one must consider all forces and torques, including gravitational, normal, frictional, tension, and applied forces.\n   - Free-body diagrams are often used to visualize and calculate the forces and torques involved.\n\nAchieving equilibrium involves adjusting these forces and torques so that they perfectly balance each other, allowing the object to maintain its state of rest or uniform motion."
