I am familiar with using `dir()` to get information about a type, such as with `my_list = []` and `dir(my_list)`. This provides me with a list of functions associated with the type. However, I want to get more information about these functions directly from the terminal or command-line, not from the Python documentation. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "In Python, you can use the `help()` function to get detailed information about a function, class, or module directly from the terminal or command-line. This function provides the docstring of the object, which often includes a description of what the function or class does, its parameters, return values, and sometimes examples of usage.\n\nHere's how you can use `help()` to get more detailed information about a function:\n\n1. **Using `help()` with a built-in function or method:**\n\n   ```python\n   help(len)\n   ```\n\n   This will provide detailed information about the `len()` function.\n\n2. **Using `help()` with a method of an object:**\n\n   If you have a list and want information about its `append` method, you can do:\n\n   ```python\n   my_list = []\n   help(my_list.append)\n   ```\n\n   This will show the documentation for the `append` method of list objects.\n\n3. **Using `help()` with custom functions:**\n\n   If you have defined a function in your script and want to see its docstring, you can use `help()` in the same way:\n\n   ```python\n   def my_function(param1, param2):\n       \"\"\"\n       This is a sample function that does something.\n\n       Parameters:\n       param1 (type): Description of param1\n       param2 (type): Description of param2\n\n       Returns:\n       type: Description of return value\n       \"\"\"\n       return param1 + param2\n\n   help(my_function)\n   ```\n\n   This will display the docstring you have written for `my_function`.\n\nBy using `help()`, you can access detailed information about functions and methods directly from your terminal, making it a handy tool for understanding how to use different parts of Python without having to leave your development environment."
