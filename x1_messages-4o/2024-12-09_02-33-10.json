Specifically, I'm trying to run the command `python py2.py -i test.txt`, where `-i` is a positional argument for argparse and `test.txt` is what it is. The `py2.py` is the file to run. I've tried several variations but none seem to work correctly. For example: `py2output = subprocess.check_output([str('python py2.py '),'-i', 'test.txt'])` and `py2output = subprocess.check_output([str('python'),'py2.py','-i', test.txt'])`. The documentation I've found for subprocess.check_output() is not very in-depth and doesn't seem to cover my use case."

        "content": "To use `subprocess.check_output()` to run a Python 2 script with arguments from a Python 3 script, you need to make sure you're providing the command and its arguments as a list, with each element being a separate part of the command. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\n# Define the command and arguments as a list\ncommand = ['python', 'py2.py', '-i', 'test.txt']\n\ntry:\n    # Run the command using subprocess.check_output\n    py2output = subprocess.check_output(command, text=True)\n\n    # Print the output from the Python 2 script\n    print(\"Output from py2.py:\", py2output)\n\nexcept subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:\n    # Handle errors in execution\n    print(\"An error occurred while trying to run the script.\")\n    print(\"Error code:\", e.returncode)\n    print(\"Error output:\", e.output)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Command as List**: You should provide the command and its arguments as a list to `subprocess.check_output()`. Each part of the command (e.g., `'python'`, `'py2.py'`, `'-i'`, `'test.txt'`) should be a separate element in the list.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Use a `try`-`except` block to catch any `CalledProcessError` exceptions that might be raised if the command fails. This way, you can handle errors gracefully.\n\n3. **Python Version**: Make sure that the `python` command points to Python 2 on your system. If it's not, you may need to specify the exact path to the Python 2 interpreter (e.g., `'python2'` or `'/usr/bin/python2'`).\n\n4. **Text Mode**: By setting `text=True`, the output will be returned as a string rather than bytes, which is often more convenient for processing in Python 3.\n\nThis should allow you to execute a Python 2 script with arguments using `subprocess.check_output()` from a Python 3 script."
