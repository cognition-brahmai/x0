I installed virtualenv using `pip install virtualenv` and have also added the PATH into my `.bash_profile`. However, every time I try to run the `virtualenv` command, it returns `-bash: virtualenv: command not found`. Despite the fact that `pip install virtualenv` returns `Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): virtualenv in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages` and the `virtualenv` is installed in `/usr/local/bin`. I've also tried to run the `virtualenv` command in the directory `/usr/local/bin`, but it gives me the same result. The PATHs I added to my .bash_profile are:\n\n```\nexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin\nexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin/python\nexport PATH=$PATH:/Library/Framework/Python.framework/Version/2.7/lib/site-packages\n```\n\nWhy isn't the `virtualenv` command found despite being installed and added to the PATH? Is there any workaround for this?"

        "content": "It sounds like you're experiencing a PATH issue or a possible shell configuration problem. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Confirm Installation Path**:\n   Make sure that `virtualenv` is indeed installed in one of the directories listed in your PATH. Run the following command to find its location:\n   ```bash\n   which virtualenv\n   ```\n   If it returns nothing, it means the shell can't find it.\n\n2. **Check Python Version**:\n   Ensure you are using the correct Python version. Sometimes, multiple Python installations can cause conflicts. Check the Python version with:\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   ```\n   You may want to use `python3` if you have a Python 3 installation.\n\n3. **Modify `.bash_profile`**:\n   The PATH lines in your `.bash_profile` seem redundant and might be causing issues. Try simplifying them:\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\"\n   ```\n   After editing, make sure to reload your `.bash_profile`:\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bash_profile\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Typos**:\n   Ensure there are no typos in your paths, especially in the `export` statements.\n\n5. **Reinstall `virtualenv`**:\n   If the above steps don't work, try reinstalling `virtualenv`:\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall virtualenv\n   pip install virtualenv\n   ```\n\n6. **Use `python -m`**:\n   As a workaround, you can try running `virtualenv` using Python directly:\n   ```bash\n   python -m virtualenv myenv\n   ```\n\n7. **Shell Differences**:\n   If you're using a shell other than bash (like zsh), make sure you're editing the correct profile file (e.g., `.zshrc` for zsh).\n\n8. **Virtual Environment with `venv`**:\n   If you're using Python 3, consider using the built-in `venv` module:\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m venv myenv\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with not being able to find the `virtualenv` command. If the problem persists, double-check any additional shell configuration files or consider using a different terminal emulator to rule out environment-specific issues."
