I've defined the symbol and function as follows:\n\n```python\nx = sympy.Symbol('x')\nf = sympy.Function('f')(x)\n```\nHowever, I'm struggling with assigning the equation to this function f(x). I attempted something like `f.exp(\"x**2 + 1\")`, but it does not seem to work. How can I properly define my function, derive it, and print out the result to the console?"

        "content": "To define a mathematical function using SymPy and then derive it, you need to explicitly define the function in terms of `x`. You can achieve this by creating an expression and then differentiating it. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Import SymPy and define the symbol `x`.\n2. Define the function `f(x) = x**2 + 1`.\n3. Differentiate the function with respect to `x`.\n4. Print the original function and its derivative.\n\nHere's a complete example demonstrating these steps:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Step 1: Define the symbol\nx = sp.Symbol('x')\n\n# Step 2: Define the function f(x) = x**2 + 1\nf = x**2 + 1\n\n# Step 3: Differentiate the function with respect to x\nf_prime = sp.diff(f, x)\n\n# Step 4: Print the original function and its derivative\nprint(f\"f(x) = {f}\")\nprint(f\"f'(x) = {f_prime}\")\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We use `sp.Symbol('x')` to define the symbol `x`.\n- The function `f` is defined simply as `x**2 + 1`.\n- The derivative is calculated using `sp.diff(f, x)`, which returns the derivative of `f` with respect to `x`.\n- Finally, we print the function and its derivative.\n\nThis approach avoids the unnecessary use of `sympy.Function`, which is more suited for abstract functions where the form of the function might not be immediately defined. Here, since you know the exact form of the function, you can directly use an expression."
