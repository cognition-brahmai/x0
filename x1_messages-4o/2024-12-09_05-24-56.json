        "content": "The error you're encountering is a common one in Python, especially when dealing with functions and variables that have the same name. In your case, `auc` is being used as a variable name somewhere in your code, which is overshadowing the `auc` function from a library. This is why you're getting a `'numpy.float64' object is not callable` error when you try to call `auc(recall, precision)`.\n\nHere's how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check for Variable Naming Conflicts**: Make sure you haven't defined a variable named `auc` elsewhere in your code. If you have, rename it to something else to prevent conflicts.\n\n2. **Import the Correct Function**: Ensure that you are importing the `auc` function correctly. You should import it from a library like `sklearn.metrics` if you are using it for precision-recall AUC calculations. Make sure you have the following import at the top of your script:\n\n    ```python\n    from sklearn.metrics import auc, precision_recall_curve, f1_score, roc_auc_score\n    ```\n\n3. **Check for Any Overwriting**: Make sure that you haven't accidentally overwritten the `auc` function by assigning a value to `auc` at any point in your script. For example:\n\n    ```python\n    auc = some_value  # This will overwrite the function reference\n    ```\n\n4. **Correct Usage**: If the above steps are fine, check if you have other imports that might have a function or variable named `auc`. This could be due to a wildcard import like `from some_module import *` which might have brought in an `auc` variable.\n\n5. **Restart and Retry**: Sometimes, Jupyter notebooks or other interactive environments can retain variable states. Restart your kernel or Python interpreter and run your script again to ensure all variables are freshly initialized.\n\nIf you follow these steps, you should be able to resolve the `'numpy.float64' object is not callable` error and get your code running smoothly."
