        "content": "Creating a React Native application that allows users to select and display a photo involves several steps. You'll need to use a library for image selection and display it in your application. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you build this functionality:\n\n1. **Set Up Your React Native Environment:**\n   Ensure you have React Native installed and set up on your machine. You can follow the official [React Native Getting Started Guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to do this.\n\n2. **Create a New React Native Project:**\n   Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new React Native project:\n   ```bash\n   npx react-native init PhotoSelectorApp\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Required Libraries:**\n   To select photos from the device, you can use the `react-native-image-picker` library. Install it by running:\n   ```bash\n   npm install react-native-image-picker\n   ```\n\n4. **Link Native Dependencies:**\n   If you're using React Native CLI, you may need to link the native dependencies. However, with newer versions of React Native, this is usually handled automatically. If needed, run:\n   ```bash\n   npx pod-install\n   ```\n\n5. **Implement Image Selection:**\n   Open your project in your code editor and modify the `App.js` file to include the functionality for selecting and displaying a photo.\n\n   ```javascript\n   import React, { useState } from 'react';\n   import { Button, Image, View, Platform } from 'react-native';\n   import { launchImageLibrary } from 'react-native-image-picker';\n\n   const App = () => {\n     const [photoUri, setPhotoUri] = useState(null);\n\n     const selectPhoto = () => {\n       const options = {\n         mediaType: 'photo',\n         quality: 1,\n       };\n\n       launchImageLibrary(options, (response) => {\n         if (response.didCancel) {\n           console.log('User cancelled image picker');\n         } else if (response.errorMessage) {\n           console.log('ImagePicker Error: ', response.errorMessage);\n         } else {\n           const source = { uri: response.assets[0].uri };\n           setPhotoUri(source.uri);\n         }\n       });\n     };\n\n     return (\n       <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>\n         <Button title=\"Select a Photo\" onPress={selectPhoto} />\n         {photoUri && (\n           <Image\n             source={{ uri: photoUri }}\n             style={{ width: 300, height: 300, marginTop: 20 }}\n           />\n         )}\n       </View>\n     );\n   };\n\n   export default App;\n   ```\n\n6. **Run Your Application:**\n   Use the following commands to run your application on an emulator or a physical device:\n\n   - For Android:\n     ```bash\n     npx react-native run-android\n     ```\n\n   - For iOS (requires a Mac with Xcode installed):\n     ```bash\n     npx react-native run-ios\n     ```\n\n7. **Test the Functionality:**\n   Once your app is running, tap on the \"Select a Photo\" button to open the image library, choose a photo, and see it displayed on the screen.\n\nThat's it! You've created a simple React Native app that allows users to select and display a photo. You can further enhance this application by adding features like cropping, image editing, or uploading the selected image to a server."
