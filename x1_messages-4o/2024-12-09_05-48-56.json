        "content": "The error message you're encountering, `bash: syntax error near unexpected token '('`, suggests that the command is being interpreted by the shell (bash) rather than being executed as a Python script. This usually happens if you try to run Python code directly in a shell without invoking the Python interpreter.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you should ensure that you're running your Python code from within a Python environment. Here are the steps you can follow:\n\n1. **Create a Python script file**: Save your Python code in a file with a `.py` extension, for example, `transform_script.py`.\n\n   ```Python\n   from lxml import etree\n   import module2dbk\n\n   result = module2dbk.xsl_transform(etree.parse('test-ccap/col10614/index.cnxml'), [])\n   print(result)\n   ```\n\n2. **Run the Python script**: Execute the script using the Python interpreter from the command line.\n\n   ```bash\n   python transform_script.py\n   ```\n\n3. **Ensure the correct Python environment**: Make sure that you have all necessary modules installed in your Python environment, such as `lxml` and `module2dbk`. You can install them using `pip` if they're not already installed:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install lxml\n   # If module2dbk is a custom or third-party module, ensure it's correctly installed and accessible.\n   ```\n\n4. **Python 2 vs. Python 3**: If you are using Python 2 and want to continue using `print` as a statement, the code is fine. However, if you are using Python 3, ensure you use `print()` as a function:\n\n   ```Python\n   print(result)\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to execute your code without encountering the syntax error you described."
