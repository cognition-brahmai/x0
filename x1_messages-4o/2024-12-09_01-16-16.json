However, I am struggling to find a way to send the same signal from within the script itself. Specifically, I want the script to automatically send a USR1 signal after 10 seconds and also receive it without the need to open two terminals. How can I achieve this?\n\nHere is my current code:\n\n```python\nimport signal\nimport os\nimport time\n\ndef receive_signal(signum, stack):\n    print('Received:', signum)\n\nsignal.signal(signal.SIGUSR1, receive_signal)\nsignal.signal(signal.SIGUSR2, receive_signal)\n\nprint('My PID is:', os.getpid())\n\nwhile True:\n    print('Waiting...')\n    time.sleep(3)\n```"

        "content": "To have your Python script send a USR1 signal to itself after a delay, you can use the `os.kill` function within the same script. This will allow you to test sending and receiving signals within one terminal. Here's how you can modify your script to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport signal\nimport os\nimport time\nimport threading\n\ndef receive_signal(signum, stack):\n    print('Received:', signum)\n\ndef send_signal_after_delay():\n    time.sleep(10)\n    os.kill(os.getpid(), signal.SIGUSR1)\n\nsignal.signal(signal.SIGUSR1, receive_signal)\nsignal.signal(signal.SIGUSR2, receive_signal)\n\nprint('My PID is:', os.getpid())\n\n# Start a separate thread to send the signal after 10 seconds\nthreading.Thread(target=send_signal_after_delay, daemon=True).start()\n\nwhile True:\n    print('Waiting...')\n    time.sleep(3)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Signal Setup**: The `signal.signal` function is used to associate the `receive_signal` function with both `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`.\n- **Send Signal**: A separate thread is created using `threading.Thread` to delay the sending of the signal. This is done to ensure that your main loop continues to run and listen for signals without being blocked by the `time.sleep` call.\n- **`os.kill` Usage**: The `os.kill(os.getpid(), signal.SIGUSR1)` function is used to send a `SIGUSR1` signal to the current process after a 10-second delay.\n\nBy using threading, you ensure that your main loop continues to run, and the sending of the signal does not interfere with the signal listening logic. This setup allows the script to both send and receive signals within the same process."
