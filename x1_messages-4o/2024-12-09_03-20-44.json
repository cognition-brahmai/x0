Slicing allows you to create a sublist that excludes the first and last items, which you can then iterate over. Here's how you can modify your loop to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfor car in cars[1:-1]:\n    # Do work for the rest\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `cars[1:-1]` creates a sublist of `cars` that starts at the second element (index 1) and ends at the second-to-last element (index -1). This effectively skips the first and last items in the list.\n- The `for` loop then iterates over this sublist, allowing you to perform operations only on the elements you want."
