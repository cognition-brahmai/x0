Now, when I check my /usr/local folder, I see folders for both CUDA 7.0 and CUDA 8.0, as well as a /cuda/ folder. The /cuda/version.txt file indicates that CUDA 8.0 is installed. However, when I run the command 'nvcc -V', it reports that I'm using version 7.0. Even after I export the library path for CUDA 8.0 and add its bin directory to the PATH, running 'nvcc -V' still outputs version 7.0. The command 'which nvcc' outputs '/usr/local/cuda-7.0/bin/nvcc', and my PATH includes '/usr/local/cuda-7.0/bin'. How can I resolve this discrepancy and ensure that my system is using CUDA 8.0?"

        "content": "To address the discrepancy and ensure that your system is using CUDA 8.0, you need to update your environment variables to point to the CUDA 8.0 installation. Here are the steps you can follow:\n\n1. **Remove the Old CUDA PATH:**\n   First, you need to remove the old CUDA 7.0 paths from your environment variables. Open your shell configuration file. If you are using bash, this is typically `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`.\n\n   Look for any lines that add `/usr/local/cuda-7.0/bin` to your `PATH` and `/usr/local/cuda-7.0/lib64` to your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and remove or comment them out.\n\n2. **Add the New CUDA 8.0 PATH:**\n   Add the following lines to your shell configuration file to include the CUDA 8.0 paths:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/bin:$PATH\n   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n   ```\n\n3. **Update the Default CUDA Symlink:**\n   The `/usr/local/cuda` symlink should point to your CUDA 8.0 installation. Run the following commands to update it:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo rm /usr/local/cuda\n   sudo ln -s /usr/local/cuda-8.0 /usr/local/cuda\n   ```\n\n4. **Reload Your Shell Configuration:**\n   Apply the changes by reloading your shell configuration:\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bashrc\n   ```\n\n   Or, if you made changes to `~/.bash_profile`, use:\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bash_profile\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify the Changes:**\n   After making these changes, check that `nvcc` is pointing to the correct version by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   which nvcc\n   nvcc -V\n   ```\n\n   Both commands should now show paths pointing to CUDA 8.0.\n\nBy following these steps, you should successfully configure your system to use CUDA 8.0. If you encounter any issues, double-check the paths and ensure that the shell configuration file was properly edited and sourced."
