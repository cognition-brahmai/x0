I have come across a few posts mentioning this package, but I don't understand what it is, or why it is included in the output of pip freeze. I am asking out of curiosity but also because it seems to break things in some cases when trying to install packages with a requirements.txt file generated with pip freeze that includes the pkg-resources==0.0.0 line. For instance, when Travis CI tries to install dependencies through pip and finds this line. What is pkg-resources, and is it safe to remove this line from requirements.txt? I have also noticed that this line only seems to be present in the output of pip freeze when I am in a virtualenv. I am uncertain about its function or what it does, but I am investigating further as it appears to be related to virtualenv."

        "content": "The appearance of `pkg-resources==0.0.0` in the output of the `pip freeze` command is a known issue that typically occurs on Debian-based systems, such as Ubuntu. It is related to how the `python-pkg-resources` package is managed on these systems.\n\n### Explanation:\n- **pkg-resources**: This is part of the `setuptools` package, which is a collection of enhancements to the Python `distutils` that allow you to more easily build and distribute Python packages. It includes a package resource API which is used for package discovery and resource management.\n- **Version 0.0.0**: The version number `0.0.0` is essentially a placeholder and is not an actual package version. This can arise due to the way the Debian packaging system manages Python packages, where the `python-pkg-resources` gets split off from `setuptools`.\n\n### Why It Appears:\n- This issue is often a result of a mismatch between the system's package manager and Python's package manager (`pip`). When `pip` is used to list installed packages, it may encounter the `pkg-resources` entry due to how the system's Python environment is set up.\n\n### Effects on `requirements.txt`:\n- Including `pkg-resources==0.0.0` in a `requirements.txt` file can cause issues when trying to install packages, as this is not a valid package that can be installed from the Python Package Index (PyPI). This is why it can break builds or installations, for instance, on CI systems like Travis CI.\n\n### Solution:\n- **Remove the Line**: It is safe to manually remove the `pkg-resources==0.0.0` line from your `requirements.txt` file. This line does not represent an actual package that you need to install and can be safely omitted.\n- **Preventing Recurrence**: To prevent this from happening again, ensure that your Python environment and package management tools (`pip`, `setuptools`, etc.) are up to date. You can also consider using virtual environments to isolate your Python environment and avoid interaction issues with the system Python packages.\n\nIf you continue to encounter issues, you might want to check if any specific configurations or other installed packages might be causing this behavior."
