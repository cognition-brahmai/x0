I've tried to allocate slightly more than the available 5.04GB using TensorFlow, but it fails and throws a CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY error. I suspect that the Nvidia user level DLL is preventing the use of all memory. Is there any way I can turn this off in Windows 10?"

        "content": "To utilize 100% of VRAM on a secondary GPU without a monitor attached, there are several strategies you can try to maximize memory allocation and manage GPU resources effectively:\n\n1. **Disable Windows GUI Use**: Sometimes the Windows GUI might reserve some GPU memory for display purposes. Since you are not using the monitor, ensure you disable any processes that might use the GPU for display. You can do this by setting your primary display to another GPU if possible.\n\n2. **Use Headless Mode**: Ensure that your GPU is running in headless mode. This can sometimes be controlled through the BIOS or GPU driver settings, ensuring no display resources are allocated.\n\n3. **TensorFlow Configuration**: You can manually set TensorFlow to allow memory growth or allocate a specific amount of GPU memory. Consider using the following configuration at the start of your TensorFlow script:\n\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n\n   gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')\n   if gpus:\n       try:\n           for gpu in gpus:\n               tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)\n           # You can also set memory limit if necessary:\n           # tf.config.experimental.set_virtual_device_configuration(\n           #     gpus[0],\n           #     [tf.config.experimental.VirtualDeviceConfiguration(memory_limit=5024)]\n           # )\n       except RuntimeError as e:\n           print(e)\n   ```\n\n4. **CUDA Environment Variables**: Set CUDA environment variables to optimize memory usage. In your command prompt or script, set the following:\n\n   ```bash\n   set CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER=PCI_BUS_ID\n   set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1  # Choose the correct ID for your secondary GPU\n   ```\n\n5. **Disable TDR (Timeout Detection and Recovery)**: This can prevent the system from resetting the GPU if it thinks it has stalled, which might reserve some memory. Be cautious when disabling TDR, as it could lead to system instability. To do this, modify the registry:\n\n   1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit).\n   2. Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\GraphicsDrivers`.\n   3. Create a new `DWORD (32-bit)` value named `TdrLevel`.\n   4. Set its value to `0` to disable TDR.\n\n6. **Driver Update and Optimization**: Ensure your Nvidia drivers are up-to-date. Sometimes, newer drivers have optimizations and fixes that can help with memory management.\n\n7. **Check for Background Processes**: Ensure no other processes are using the GPU. You can monitor GPU usage using tools like Nvidia's System Management Interface (`nvidia-smi`) to see what processes are using the GPU and how much memory they are using.\n\nBy following these strategies, you should be able to maximize the VRAM usage on your secondary GPU. However, always be cautious when making system changes, especially with registry edits or disabling system features like TDR."
