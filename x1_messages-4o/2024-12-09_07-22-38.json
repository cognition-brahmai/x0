I've tried using the command `pip install https://github.com/user/repo.git@branch`, replacing the placeholders with the actual values. Specifically, I tried `pip install https://github.com/tangentlabs/django-oscar-paypal.git@/issue/34/oscar-0.6`, but it returned a 404 error. How can I resolve this and successfully install the specific branch?"

Make sure the branch name is correct.\n\nIf you continue to receive a 404 error, double-check the following:\n\n1. **Branch Name**: Ensure that the branch name (`issue/34/oscar-0.6`) is correct and exists in the repository.\n2. **Access Rights**: Ensure that the repository is public or, if private, you have the necessary access rights.\n3. **Repository URL**: Double-check the repository URL for any typos.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully install a package from a specific branch of a GitHub repository using pip."
