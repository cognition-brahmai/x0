Train A is traveling at a speed of 54 km/h, and train B is traveling at a speed of 42 km/h. Write an R code to find out how much time it will take for both trains to meet each other?\nFollow these instructions to solve the problem:\n1. Declare a variable named `distance` and initialize it with a value of 120 (distance between the two trains).\n2. Declare two variables named `speed_a` and `speed_b` and initialize them with the speeds of train A and train B respectively.\n3. Calculate the relative speed of both trains using the formula `relative_speed = speed_a + speed_b`.\n4. Calculate the time taken for both trains to meet each other using the formula `time = distance / relative_speed`.\n5. Print the calculated time using the `print()` function.\nUse the following R code template to solve the problem:\ndistance <- 120\nspeed_a <- 54\nspeed_b <- 42\nrelative_speed <- speed_a + speed_b\ntime <- distance / relative_speed\nprint(paste(\"It will take\", time, \"hours for both trains to meet each other.\"))"
