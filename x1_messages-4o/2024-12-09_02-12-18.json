I attempted to test these options with the following code:\n\n```python\ndf1 = pd.DataFrame([1,2,3,4,5])\ndf2 = df1\ndf3 = df1.copy()\ndf4 = df1.copy(deep=False)\ndf1 = pd.DataFrame([9,9,9])\n```\n\nThe outputs I received for df1, df2, df3, df4 were:\n\n```python\ndf1: [9,9,9]\ndf2: [1,2,3,4,5]\ndf3: [1,2,3,4,5]\ndf4: [1,2,3,4,5]\n```\n\nI don't seem to observe any difference in the output between '.copy()' and '.copy(deep=False)'. Could someone explain why this is so? I was expecting one of the options '=', copy(), copy(deep=False) to return [9,9,9]. What am I missing?"

        "content": "Let's break down the behavior you're observing with each of the different assignments and copying methods in your code:\n\n1. **`df2 = df1`**: This line creates a new reference `df2` to the same DataFrame object that `df1` is pointing to. Any changes to the DataFrame through `df1` or `df2` will affect the same underlying data because both variables are just references to the same object in memory. However, when you do `df1 = pd.DataFrame([9,9,9])`, you are not modifying the original DataFrame, but instead, you are creating a new DataFrame object and assigning it to `df1`. `df2` still points to the original DataFrame `[1,2,3,4,5]`.\n\n2. **`df3 = df1.copy()`**: This line creates a deep copy of the DataFrame `df1`. A deep copy means that a completely new DataFrame is created with its own copy of the data. Changes made to `df1` after this point will not affect `df3`, and vice versa. So, `df3` remains `[1,2,3,4,5]` even after `df1` is reassigned.\n\n3. **`df4 = df1.copy(deep=False)`**: This line creates a shallow copy of the DataFrame `df1`. A shallow copy means that while the top-level structure of the DataFrame is copied, the actual data is not; `df4` shares the same data as `df1`. However, similar to the deep copy, when you reassign `df1` with a new DataFrame, `df4` still points to the original data `[1,2,3,4,5]` because the original DataFrame object that `df1` was pointing to hasn't been changed, only the reference `df1` itself has been changed to point to a new DataFrame.\n\nIn your testing, you are not modifying the original DataFrame's data directly after creating `df2`, `df3`, and `df4`, but are instead reassigning `df1` to an entirely new DataFrame. This reassignment doesn't affect `df2`, `df3`, or `df4` because they are still pointing to the original data that was in `df1` before the reassignment. If you had modified the data in `df1` directly (for example, by using `df1.iloc[0] = 9`), then you would see different behaviors between the shallow and deep copies in `df3` and `df4`."
