Is there a way to have a `defaultdict(defaultdict(int))` to make the following code work? \n\n```python\nfor x in stuff:\n    d[x.a][x.b] += x.c_int\n```\n\nI considered using this code:\n\n```python\nfor x in stuff:\n    d[x.a,x.b] += x.c_int\n```\n\nBut with this I can't use `d.keys()` or `d[x.a].keys()`. Can you help me find a solution?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve the desired behavior by using `collections.defaultdict` in Python. To create a nested `defaultdict` where the inner dictionary is also a `defaultdict` of integers, you can define it as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\n# Create a defaultdict where each value is another defaultdict of int\nd = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n\n# Iterate over your items and update the dictionary\nfor x in stuff:\n    d[x.a][x.b] += x.c_int\n```\n\nIn this setup:\n\n- `d` is a `defaultdict` where each value is another `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory. This means that if `d[x.a]` doesn't exist, it will automatically be initialized as a `defaultdict(int)`.\n- `d[x.a][x.b]` will default to `0`, and you can safely increment it using `+= x.c_int`.\n\nThis approach lets you use `d.keys()` to get the keys at the first level (i.e., `x.a` values) and `d[x.a].keys()` to get the keys at the second level (i.e., `x.b` values). This should match the behavior and requirements you described."
