        "content": "To modify your hospital database application to include the requirement of filtering medical procedures performed by doctors who have received international awards in their specialty, you can use the SQL queries you provided, with some minor improvements for clarity and efficiency. Here are the refined SQL queries:\n\n1. **Query to get all patients and their medical procedures performed by internationally awarded doctors in a specific specialty:**\n   ```sql\n   SELECT p.*\n   FROM Patients p\n   JOIN MedicalProcedures mp ON p.PatientId = mp.PatientId\n   JOIN Doctors d ON mp.DoctorId = d.DoctorId\n   WHERE d.Specialty = 'specialty_name' \n     AND EXISTS (\n         SELECT 1 \n         FROM Awards a \n         WHERE a.DoctorId = d.DoctorId \n           AND a.AwardType = 'International'\n     );\n   ```\n\n2. **Query to get all doctors who have performed procedures in a specific specialty and have received international awards:**\n   ```sql\n   SELECT DISTINCT d.*\n   FROM Doctors d\n   JOIN MedicalProcedures mp ON d.DoctorId = mp.DoctorId\n   WHERE d.Specialty = 'specialty_name' \n     AND EXISTS (\n         SELECT 1 \n         FROM Awards a \n         WHERE a.DoctorId = d.DoctorId \n           AND a.AwardType = 'International'\n     );\n   ```\n\n3. **Query to get all medical procedures performed by doctors in a specific specialty who have received international awards:**\n   ```sql\n   SELECT mp.*\n   FROM MedicalProcedures mp\n   JOIN Doctors d ON mp.DoctorId = d.DoctorId\n   WHERE d.Specialty = 'specialty_name' \n     AND EXISTS (\n         SELECT 1 \n         FROM Awards a \n         WHERE a.DoctorId = d.DoctorId \n           AND a.AwardType = 'International'\n     );\n   ```\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Replace 'specialty_name':** Make sure to replace `'specialty_name'` with the actual specialty you're interested in.\n- **Performance Optimization:** Consider indexing columns that frequently appear in your WHERE clauses, such as `DoctorId`, `Specialty`, and `AwardType`, to enhance query performance.\n- **Data Validation:** Ensure your data accurately reflects the relationships between doctors, awards, and specialties to prevent incorrect filtering.\n\nBy implementing these queries, your application will be able to effectively filter and display only the relevant medical procedures linked to internationally awarded doctors in the desired specialty."
