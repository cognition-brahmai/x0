Here's the code I am using:\n\n```python\ndct = {}\nfor i in range(0, 10):\n    for j in range(0, 100):\n        dct[i] = dct.get(i, []).append(j)\n```\nHowever, when I execute the above code, I get an 'AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'append''. I understand that lists do have an 'append' method, so I attempted to simplify my test as follows:\n\n```python\ndct = {}\nfor i in range(0, 10):\n    dct[i] = dct.get(i, []).append(i)\n```\nBut the output I received was `{0: None, 1: None, 2: None, 3: None, 4: None, 5: None, 6: None, 7: None, 8: None, 9: None}`. I am perplexed as to why `dct.get(i, [])` is returning `None` by default, instead of `[]`. I also tried `dct.get(i, list())` but it has the same issue. Could you help me understand why this is happening and how to solve it?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the behavior of the `append` method in Python. The `append` method modifies the list in place and returns `None`. Therefore, when you do:\n\n```python\ndct[i] = dct.get(i, []).append(j)\n```\n\nYou are effectively assigning `None` to `dct[i]` because `append` returns `None`. This is why your dictionary ends up with `None` values.\n\nTo fix this, you need to separate the retrieval and modification of the list from the assignment. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndct = {}\nfor i in range(0, 10):\n    for j in range(0, 100):\n        # Retrieve the list for the key i, or an empty list if the key doesn't exist\n        lst = dct.get(i, [])\n        # Append j to the list\n        lst.append(j)\n        # Assign the updated list back to the dictionary\n        dct[i] = lst\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use `defaultdict` from the `collections` module, which simplifies the process of initializing dictionary entries:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndct = defaultdict(list)\nfor i in range(0, 10):\n    for j in range(0, 100):\n        dct[i].append(j)\n```\n\nWith `defaultdict`, if the key does not exist, it automatically initializes it with a list, so you don't have to manually check and initialize it with `dct.get(i, [])`."
