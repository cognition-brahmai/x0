Here's a classification of the mentioned animals according to their biological classification and geographical distribution:\n\n1. **Whale**\n   - **Biological Classification**: Mammal (Order: Cetacea)\n   - **Geographical Distribution**: Whales are found in oceans worldwide, from the Arctic and Antarctic to tropical waters. Different species have specific ranges, but collectively, whales inhabit all major oceans and seas.\n\n2. **Dolphin**\n   - **Biological Classification**: Mammal (Order: Cetacea, Family: Delphinidae)\n   - **Geographical Distribution**: Dolphins are found in oceans and seas around the world, including both coastal and offshore waters. Some species are also found in freshwater rivers in South America and Asia.\n\n3. **Shark**\n   - **Biological Classification**: Fish (Class: Chondrichthyes, Subclass: Elasmobranchii)\n   - **Geographical Distribution**: Sharks inhabit all major oceans and are found in a variety of oceanic environments, from shallow coastal waters to deep oceanic regions. Some species, like the bull shark, can also enter freshwater rivers and lakes.\n\n4. **Clam**\n   - **Biological Classification**: Mollusk (Class: Bivalvia)\n   - **Geographical Distribution**: Clams are found in marine and freshwater environments worldwide. They inhabit sandy, muddy, and rocky substrates along coastlines, estuaries, and riverbeds.\n\n5. **Crab**\n   - **Biological Classification**: Crustacean (Order: Decapoda)\n   - **Geographical Distribution**: Crabs are found in oceans, freshwater bodies, and on land across the globe. They inhabit tropical and temperate regions, with species adapted to a wide range of environments, from intertidal zones to deep-sea floors."
