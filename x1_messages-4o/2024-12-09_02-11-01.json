I have a text classification application where I'm using Textblob and NaiveBayesClassifier. After training the model, I'm serializing it using pickle. However, when I try to load the pickled file, I'm getting this error. Here is my code for training and pickling the model:\n\n```python\nimport pickle\nfrom textblob.classifiers import NaiveBayesClassifier\n\nwith open('sample.csv', 'r') as fp:\n     cl = NaiveBayesClassifier(fp, format=\"csv\")\n\nf = open('sample_classifier.pickle', 'wb')\npickle.dump(cl, f)\nf.close()\n```\n\nAnd this is the code section where I attempt to load the pickled file:\n\n```python\nimport pickle\nf = open('sample_classifier.pickle', encoding=\"utf8\")\ncl = pickle.load(f)    \nf.close()\n```\n\nThe contents of my `sample.csv` are:\n\n```\nMy SQL is not working correctly at all. This was a wrong choice, SQL\nI've issues. Please respond immediately, Support\n```\n\nWhat am I doing wrong here?"

        "content": "The `UnicodeDecodeError` you are encountering is due to the fact that you're opening a binary file with text mode settings, by specifying an `encoding`. When dealing with pickled files, you need to ensure that the file is opened in binary mode. Here's how you can fix the issue:\n\n1. When loading the pickled file, open it in binary mode by using `'rb'` instead of specifying an encoding.\n\nHere is the corrected code for loading the pickled file:\n\n```python\nimport pickle\n\n# Open the file in binary mode\nwith open('sample_classifier.pickle', 'rb') as f:\n    cl = pickle.load(f)\n```\n\nBy using `'rb'` (read-binary mode), you are telling Python to read the file as binary data, which is necessary for correctly unpickling the object.\n\nAdditionally, it's good practice to use the `with` statement for opening files, as it ensures that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised. I've incorporated that into the corrected code snippet above."
