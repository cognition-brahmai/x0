I have tried using the `product` function in `itertools` but it doesn't provide the output in the format I need. What I want is to take a dictionary with an arbitrary number of keys and an arbitrary number of elements in each value, and then generate a dictionary representing the next permutation. For instance, given this input:\n\n```python\noptions = {\"number\": [1,2,3], \"color\": [\"orange\",\"blue\"] }\nprint list( my_product(options) )\n```\n\nI want to get the following output:\n\n```python\n[ {\"number\": 1, \"color\": \"orange\"},\n  {\"number\": 1, \"color\": \"blue\"},\n  {\"number\": 2, \"color\": \"orange\"},\n  {\"number\": 2, \"color\": \"blue\"},\n  {\"number\": 3, \"color\": \"orange\"},\n  {\"number\": 3, \"color\": \"blue\"}\n]\n```\n\nWhat would be the best way to achieve this?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired output, you can use the `product` function from the `itertools` module to compute the Cartesian product of the values in your dictionary, and then construct dictionaries from these products. Here's a function called `my_product` that does exactly that:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef my_product(options):\n    # Extract the keys and the corresponding lists of values\n    keys = options.keys()\n    values = options.values()\n    \n    # Use itertools.product to generate the Cartesian product of the lists of values\n    for combination in product(*values):\n        # Create a dictionary for each combination by zipping the keys and the combination\n        yield dict(zip(keys, combination))\n\n# Example usage\noptions = {\"number\": [1, 2, 3], \"color\": [\"orange\", \"blue\"]}\nresult = list(my_product(options))\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n\n```python\n[\n    {\"number\": 1, \"color\": \"orange\"},\n    {\"number\": 1, \"color\": \"blue\"},\n    {\"number\": 2, \"color\": \"orange\"},\n    {\"number\": 2, \"color\": \"blue\"},\n    {\"number\": 3, \"color\": \"orange\"},\n    {\"number\": 3, \"color\": \"blue\"}\n]\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n1. **Extract Keys and Values:** We first get the keys and values of the dictionary. The `keys` will be used to construct the resulting dictionaries, and the `values` are the lists whose Cartesian product we want to compute.\n\n2. **Compute Cartesian Product:** We use `itertools.product(*values)` to compute the Cartesian product of the lists. The `*values` syntax unpacks the list of lists, passing each list as a separate argument to `product`.\n\n3. **Generate Dictionaries:** For each combination produced by `product`, we use `zip(keys, combination)` to pair each key with its corresponding value in the combination, and `dict` to create a dictionary from these pairs.\n\n4. **Yield Results:** The function uses a generator to yield each resulting dictionary, which can then be converted to a list or used directly in a loop."
