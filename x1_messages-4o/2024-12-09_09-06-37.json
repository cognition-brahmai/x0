        "content": "Certainly! To print numbers from 1 to 50 in random order, you can use a simple algorithm involving shuffling. Here's a step-by-step outline of the algorithm:\n\n1. **Create a List**: Start by creating a list (or array) containing numbers from 1 to 50.\n\n2. **Shuffle the List**: Use a random shuffle algorithm to rearrange the elements in the list randomly.\n\n3. **Print the List**: Iterate through the shuffled list and print each number.\n\nHere's a sample Java program implementing the above algorithm:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.Collections;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class RandomOrderPrinter {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Step 1: Create a list containing numbers from 1 to 50\n        List<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();\n        for (int i = 1; i <= 50; i++) {\n            numbers.add(i);\n        }\n\n        // Step 2: Shuffle the list to randomize the order\n        Collections.shuffle(numbers);\n\n        // Step 3: Print the shuffled numbers\n        for (int number : numbers) {\n            System.out.println(number);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **List Creation**: We use an `ArrayList` to store numbers from 1 to 50.\n- **Shuffling**: The `Collections.shuffle()` method is used to randomly shuffle the elements of the list.\n- **Printing**: Finally, we iterate over the shuffled list and print each number.\n\nThis program will output the numbers from 1 to 50 in a random order each time it's run."
