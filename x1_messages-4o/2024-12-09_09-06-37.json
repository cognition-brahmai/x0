        "content": "To create a Java program that can perform different operations (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up your development environment**: Make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer. You can use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or you can simply use a text editor and compile the program using the command line.\n\n2. **Write the Java program**: Below is a simple example of a Java program that performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class Calculator {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        \n        System.out.println(\"Enter first number:\");\n        double num1 = scanner.nextDouble();\n        \n        System.out.println(\"Enter second number:\");\n        double num2 = scanner.nextDouble();\n        \n        System.out.println(\"Choose an operation: +, -, *, /\");\n        char operation = scanner.next().charAt(0);\n        \n        double result;\n        \n        switch (operation) {\n            case '+':\n                result = num1 + num2;\n                System.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n                break;\n            case '-':\n                result = num1 - num2;\n                System.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n                break;\n            case '*':\n                result = num1 * num2;\n                System.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n                break;\n            case '/':\n                if (num2 != 0) {\n                    result = num1 / num2;\n                    System.out.println(\"Result: \" + result);\n                } else {\n                    System.out.println(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\");\n                }\n                break;\n            default:\n                System.out.println(\"Invalid operation.\");\n                break;\n        }\n        \n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n3. **Compile and run the program**:\n   - If using the command line, save the program to a file named `Calculator.java`.\n   - Open the command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.\n   - Compile the program using the command: `javac Calculator.java`\n   - Run the compiled program using the command: `java Calculator`\n\n4. **Test the program**: Enter two numbers and an operation when prompted to see the result.\n\nThis program uses a `Scanner` to read user input from the console. It performs the chosen arithmetic operation using a `switch` statement and outputs the result. Remember to handle division by zero to prevent runtime errors."
