Can you figure out which function it is and write the correct code to fix the spelling mistake? Remember, precision is key in coding."

This function allows you to replace occurrences of a specified substring with another substring. Here is an example of how you can use it in Python to replace \"recieve\" with \"receive\":\n\n```python\ndef correct_spelling(text):\n    return text.replace(\"recieve\", \"receive\")\n\n# Example usage\ntext_with_mistake = \"Please ensure you recieve the package.\"\ncorrected_text = correct_spelling(text_with_mistake)\nprint(corrected_text)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\nPlease ensure you receive the package.\n```\n\nThis code efficiently replaces the incorrect spelling with the correct one throughout the entire text."
