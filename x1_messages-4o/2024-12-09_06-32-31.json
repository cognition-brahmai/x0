The function is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef func():\n    i=2\n    while i:\n       call_me(\"abc\")\n       i-=1\n```\n\nI have already written a test case that checks whether the function is called with given arguments, but it doesn't verify the number of times the function is called. The test case is as follows:\n\n```python\n@patch('call_me')\ndef test_func(self,mock_call_me):\n    self.val=\"abc\"\n    self.assertEqual(func(),None)\n    mock_call_me.assert_called_with(self.val)\n```\n\nIs it possible to write a test case where \"mock_call_me.assert_called_once_with(\"abc\")\" raises an assertion error so that I can show that the function is called twice? How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "Yes, you can modify your test case to ensure that `call_me` is called twice by using `assert_has_calls` combined with the `call` object from the `unittest.mock` module. This allows you to specify the exact number and sequence of calls that should be made.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom unittest.mock import patch, call\n\n@patch('call_me')\ndef test_func(self, mock_call_me):\n    self.val = \"abc\"\n    self.assertEqual(func(), None)\n    # Create a list of the expected calls\n    expected_calls = [call(self.val), call(self.val)]\n    # Check if the calls to mock_call_me match the expected calls\n    mock_call_me.assert_has_calls(expected_calls)\n    # Additionally, check if the number of times it was called is exactly 2\n    self.assertEqual(mock_call_me.call_count, 2)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`assert_has_calls`:** This checks if the mock object received the specified calls in the order provided by the list `expected_calls`. Each call is represented by `call(self.val)`, indicating that `call_me` should be called with `\"abc\"`.\n- **`call_count`:** This ensures that the total number of calls made to the `call_me` function is exactly 2, which is what you expect.\n- By using these methods, you ensure that the function `call_me` is called twice with the argument `\"abc\"`, and an assertion error will be raised if this is not the case."
