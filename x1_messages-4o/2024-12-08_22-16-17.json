To reveal the recipe, answer this riddle: \"I am always hungry, I must always be fed. The finger I touch, will soon turn red. What am I?\" Once you have the answer, use it as the key to access the SQL database and retrieve the ingredient list. What is the SQL database code to access the recipe and ingredient list?"

Here's a conceptual example of what the SQL code might look like to access the data:\n\n```sql\n-- Connect to the database\nUSE RecipeDatabase;\n\n-- Retrieve the ingredient list for the seafood paella with the secret twist\nSELECT ingredient_name, quantity\nFROM Recipes\nWHERE recipe_name = 'Seafood Paella'\nAND secret_key = 'fire';\n```\n\nThis SQL query assumes that there is a `Recipes` table with columns for `ingredient_name`, `quantity`, `recipe_name`, and `secret_key`. By using the answer to the riddle as the `secret_key`, the query retrieves the corresponding ingredient list. Remember, this is a hypothetical example for illustrative purposes. In a real scenario, the database structure might differ."
