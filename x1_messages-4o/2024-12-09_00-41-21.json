        "content": "To get Python Numba working on Ubuntu 14.10 or Fedora 21 with Python 2.7, you'll need to ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies installed for compiling `llvmlite`, which is a dependency for Numba. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you set it up:\n\n### For Ubuntu 14.10:\n\n1. **Update your system:**\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get upgrade\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Python development headers and pip:**\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip\n   ```\n\n3. **Install LLVM:**\n   - Since `llvmlite` requires LLVM, you need to install it. Unfortunately, Ubuntu 14.10 does not have the required version in its repositories, so you might need to build it from source or use a PPA.\n   - If you choose to build from source, you can download the LLVM source from the LLVM website and follow their build instructions.\n\n4. **Install additional dependencies:**\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install build-essential\n   sudo apt-get install libffi-dev\n   ```\n\n5. **Install `llvmlite` and `numba`:**\n   Once you have LLVM installed, you can proceed to install `llvmlite` and `numba`:\n   ```bash\n   pip install llvmlite\n   pip install numba\n   ```\n\n### For Fedora 21:\n\n1. **Update your system:**\n   ```bash\n   sudo yum update\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Python development headers and pip:**\n   ```bash\n   sudo yum install python-devel\n   sudo yum install python-pip\n   ```\n\n3. **Install LLVM:**\n   - Similar to Ubuntu, you might need to build LLVM from source or find a suitable package, as Fedora 21 might not have the required version in its repositories.\n\n4. **Install additional dependencies:**\n   ```bash\n   sudo yum install gcc-c++\n   sudo yum install libffi-devel\n   ```\n\n5. **Install `llvmlite` and `numba`:**\n   Once LLVM is set up, you can install `llvmlite` and `numba` using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install llvmlite\n   pip install numba\n   ```\n\n### Additional Tips:\n\n- **Virtual Environment:** It\u2019s a good idea to use a Python virtual environment to manage your packages and dependencies. You can create one using:\n  ```bash\n  sudo pip install virtualenv\n  virtualenv numba-env\n  source numba-env/bin/activate\n  ```\n\n- **Check LLVM version:** Ensure the LLVM version you install is compatible with `llvmlite`. You might need to check the llvmlite documentation or GitHub page for specific version requirements.\n\n- **Troubleshooting:** If you encounter errors during the installation, carefully read the error messages for clues. It might be necessary to adjust your environment variables or provide specific paths during the installation process.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to compile and install `llvmlite` and `numba` successfully on your system."
