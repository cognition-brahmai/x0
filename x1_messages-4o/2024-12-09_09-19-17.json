        "content": "To create a Swift program that calculates the sum of a range of integers, you can use a simple loop or leverage Swift's built-in functions to achieve this. Below is an example of both approaches:\n\n### Using a Loop\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nfunc sumOfRange(start: Int, end: Int) -> Int {\n    var sum = 0\n    for number in start...end {\n        sum += number\n    }\n    return sum\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nlet start = 1\nlet end = 10\nlet sum = sumOfRange(start: start, end: end)\nprint(\"The sum of integers from \\(start) to \\(end) is \\(sum).\")\n```\n\n### Using Swift's Built-in Functions\n\nYou can use the `reduce` method which is a higher-order function available in Swift:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nfunc sumOfRange(start: Int, end: Int) -> Int {\n    return (start...end).reduce(0, +)\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nlet start = 1\nlet end = 10\nlet sum = sumOfRange(start: start, end: end)\nprint(\"The sum of integers from \\(start) to \\(end) is \\(sum).\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Using a Loop**: \n   - Initialize a variable `sum` to 0.\n   - Use a `for` loop to iterate through each integer in the range from `start` to `end`.\n   - Add each integer to `sum`.\n\n2. **Using `reduce`**:\n   - The `reduce` function takes an initial result (in this case, 0) and a closure that specifies how to combine the current result with each element of the range.\n   - The `+` operator is used as the closure here to add up the values.\n\nBoth methods will give you the sum of integers in the specified range. Choose the one that you feel most comfortable with or that best fits your coding style."
