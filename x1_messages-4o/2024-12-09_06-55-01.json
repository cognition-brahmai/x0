However, after approximately 1 hour of running and before reaching Twitter's rate limit, I encounter the following error: [Errno 10054] An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host. I've searched around and found that the Twitter server might be forcibly closing the connection due to too many requests. What could be causing this issue and how can I solve it?"

        "content": "When you encounter the error `[Errno 10054] An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host`, it usually indicates that the server, in this case, Twitter, is closing the connection. This could be happening for a few reasons:\n\n1. **Rate Limiting**: Even if you're not hitting the official rate limit, Twitter might temporarily block your IP if it detects what it considers excessive activity. Make sure you're adhering to Twitter's API rate limits, which vary depending on the type of request and your access level (standard, elevated, etc.).\n\n2. **Connection Issues**: Network instability or interruptions can lead to this error. Ensure your internet connection is stable.\n\n3. **Timeouts**: If a request takes too long to process, Twitter might close the connection. You can try increasing the timeout setting in your requests.\n\n4. **IP Blocking**: If you're making requests from a single IP address, Twitter might temporarily block it if it detects suspicious activity. Using a proxy or rotating IPs could help mitigate this.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and retry logic in your code. This can help manage unexpected disconnections or server errors. Use exponential backoff for retries to avoid overwhelming the server.\n\n6. **Keep-Alive Settings**: Ensure your HTTP client is correctly configured to handle keep-alive connections, or explicitly close connections after each request to avoid issues.\n\nTo address the issue:\n\n- **Monitor Requests**: Keep track of your request patterns to ensure they comply with Twitter's limits.\n- **Use a Proxy**: Consider using a proxy service to distribute requests.\n- **Implement Retries**: Add retry logic with exponential backoff to handle transient errors.\n- **Check Documentation**: Ensure you're using the latest version of Twitter-py and that your code aligns with the library's recommendations and Twitter's API guidelines.\n\nBy taking these steps, you should be able to mitigate the risk of having your connections forcibly closed."
