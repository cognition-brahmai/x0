Regardless of the order of the plot and scatter calls, the plot comes out the same and not as I'd like. How can I plot the lines first and points last in matplotlib? Here is the code I am working with:\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef poisson(m):\n    def f(k):\n        e = math.e**(-m)\n        f = math.factorial(k)\n        g = m**k\n        return g*e/f\n    return f\n\nR = range(20)\nL = list()\nmeans = (1,4,10)\nfor m in means:\n    f = poisson(m)\n    L.append([f(k) for k in R])\ncolors = ['r','b','purple']\n\nfor c,P in zip(colors,L):\n    plt.plot(R,P,color='0.2',lw=1.5)\n    plt.scatter(R,P,s=150,color=c)\n\nax = plt.axes()\nax.set_xlim(-0.5,20)\nax.set_ylim(-0.01,0.4)\nplt.savefig('example.png')\n```"

        "content": "To ensure that the points from the `scatter` function are plotted on top of the lines drawn by the `plot` function in your matplotlib plot, you can use the `zorder` parameter. The `zorder` parameter controls the drawing order of the plot elements. Higher `zorder` values are drawn on top of lower `zorder` values. \n\nIn your case, you want the points to be on top of the lines, so you should assign a higher `zorder` to the scatter plot compared to the line plot. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef poisson(m):\n    def f(k):\n        e = math.e**(-m)\n        f = math.factorial(k)\n        g = m**k\n        return g*e/f\n    return f\n\nR = range(20)\nL = list()\nmeans = (1, 4, 10)\nfor m in means:\n    f = poisson(m)\n    L.append([f(k) for k in R])\ncolors = ['r', 'b', 'purple']\n\nfor c, P in zip(colors, L):\n    plt.plot(R, P, color='0.2', lw=1.5, zorder=1)  # Lines with lower zorder\n    plt.scatter(R, P, s=150, color=c, zorder=2)    # Points with higher zorder\n\nax = plt.axes()\nax.set_xlim(-0.5, 20)\nax.set_ylim(-0.01, 0.4)\nplt.savefig('example.png')\n```\n\nBy setting `zorder=1` for the lines and `zorder=2` for the points, you ensure that the scatter points are rendered on top of the lines. This should solve the issue of the lines showing inside the points."
