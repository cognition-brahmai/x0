        "content": "When you fetch data from a webpage using `urllib2.urlopen(url).read()`, you can tell if the data is gzipped by inspecting the HTTP headers returned by the server. Specifically, you should check the `Content-Encoding` header. If the value of this header is `gzip`, then the data is gzipped.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you might check for this:\n\n```python\nimport urllib2\n\nurl = 'http://example.com'\nresponse = urllib2.urlopen(url)\nheaders = response.info()\n\nif 'gzip' in headers.get('Content-Encoding', ''):\n    print('The data is gzipped.')\nelse:\n    print('The data is not gzipped.')\n```\n\nAs for the second part of your question, yes, `urllib2` automatically handles the decompression of gzipped data. This means that when you use `urlopen()` and then read the data using `.read()`, `urllib2` will decompress it for you if it is gzipped. Therefore, the data you receive will not be in a compressed format.\n\nRegarding the format of the data, the data returned by `urllib2.urlopen(url).read()` will always be in the form of a byte string. In Python 2, this is simply a `str` object, while in Python 3, it is a `bytes` object. You may need to decode it to a proper string if you are working with text data. For example, in Python 3, you can decode it using:\n\n```python\ndata = response.read()\ndecoded_data = data.decode('utf-8')  # or whatever encoding is appropriate\n```\n\nThis decoding step is necessary because web content is typically encoded using a specific character encoding, such as UTF-8."
