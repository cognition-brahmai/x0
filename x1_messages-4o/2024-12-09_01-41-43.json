I want to plot some data, create a new figure and plot a second set of data, and then return to the original plot and add a third set of data. However, I am unsure of how to access the original plot again. I am aware of the solution in this post \"How do I tell matplotlib that I am done with a plot?\" but it does not allow me to access the original plot. Could you provide me with a solution?\n\n<pre><code>import numpy as np\nimport matplotlib as plt\n\nx = arange(5)\ny = np.exp(5)\nplt.figure()\nplt.plot(x, y)\n\nz = np.sin(x)\nplt.figure()\nplt.plot(x, z)\n\nw = np.cos(x)\nplt.figure(\"\"\"first figure\"\"\") # Here's the part I need\nplt.plot(x, w)\n</code></pre>"

        "content": "To solve the issue of returning to a previous figure in Matplotlib, you can use the `figure` function with a figure number or a figure object. Here\u2019s how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nx = np.arange(5)\ny = np.exp(x)\nz = np.sin(x)\nw = np.cos(x)\n\n# Create the first figure and plot the first set of data\nfig1 = plt.figure()\nplt.plot(x, y, label='exp(x)')\nplt.title('First Figure')\nplt.legend()\n\n# Create the second figure and plot the second set of data\nfig2 = plt.figure()\nplt.plot(x, z, label='sin(x)')\nplt.title('Second Figure')\nplt.legend()\n\n# Return to the first figure and add a third set of data\nplt.figure(fig1.number)\nplt.plot(x, w, label='cos(x)', linestyle='--')\nplt.legend()\n\n# Show both figures\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Creating Figures**: When you create a figure using `plt.figure()`, you can store it in a variable (e.g., `fig1`, `fig2`). This allows you to reference it later.\n\n2. **Accessing a Specific Figure**: Use `plt.figure(fig1.number)` to switch back to the first figure you created. The `number` attribute of the figure object gives you the figure number.\n\n3. **Adding to the Plot**: Once you've switched back to the original figure, you can add more data to it using `plt.plot()`.\n\nThis approach gives you control over which figure you're working with at any time, allowing you to add data to existing plots as needed."
