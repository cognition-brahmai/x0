Also, can the query include a column that shows the percentage increase in time from the slowest time of the previous year to the slowest time of this year? I need the query to handle a larger dataset with diverse data structures and perform the necessary computations accurately. Can you provide a sample Python code for this?"

        "content": "To achieve this, you'll need to use Python along with a library like Pandas for data manipulation and analysis. Let's assume you have a dataset in a CSV file or a database with columns such as `athlete_name`, `country`, `event`, `time`, and `year`. You'll want to filter the data for the last two years, find the slowest times that occurred more than once, and calculate the percentage increase from the previous year's slowest time.\n\nHere's a sample Python code using Pandas to perform these operations:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load your dataset\n# Assuming 'data.csv' is your dataset file\n# and it contains columns: athlete_name, country, event, time, year\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n\n# Filter data for the last two years\ncurrent_year = 2023  # Update this to the current year\nlast_year_data = df[df['year'] == current_year - 1]\ncurrent_year_data = df[df['year'] == current_year]\n\n# Function to find slowest time that occurred more than once\ndef find_slowest_repeated_times(data):\n    slowest_times = data.groupby(['event', 'time']).size().reset_index(name='count')\n    slowest_times = slowest_times[slowest_times['count'] > 1]\n    slowest_times = slowest_times.sort_values(by='time', ascending=False).groupby('event').first().reset_index()\n    return slowest_times\n\n# Find slowest times for last year and current year\nslowest_last_year = find_slowest_repeated_times(last_year_data)\nslowest_current_year = find_slowest_repeated_times(current_year_data)\n\n# Merge these slowest times with the original data to get athlete and country\nslowest_last_year = slowest_last_year.merge(last_year_data, on=['event', 'time'], how='left')\nslowest_current_year = slowest_current_year.merge(current_year_data, on=['event', 'time'], how='left')\n\n# Calculate percentage increase in time\nresult = slowest_current_year.merge(slowest_last_year, on='event', suffixes=('_current', '_last'))\nresult['percentage_increase'] = ((result['time_current'] - result['time_last']) / result['time_last']) * 100\n\n# Select required columns\nfinal_result = result[['athlete_name_current', 'country_current', 'event', 'time_current', 'percentage_increase']]\nfinal_result.columns = ['athlete_name', 'country', 'event', 'slowest_time', 'percentage_increase']\n\n# Display the result\nprint(final_result)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- This code assumes your data is in a CSV format. You may need to adjust the data loading section if you're using a database.\n- The `find_slowest_repeated_times` function finds the slowest time that occurred more than once for each event.\n- The `merge` operation is used to join the slowest times from the last year and the current year to calculate the percentage increase.\n- The `percentage_increase` is calculated and added as a new column to the final result.\n\nYou may need to adapt this code to fit your specific dataset structure and ensure it handles any edge cases relevant to your data."
