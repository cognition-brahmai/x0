Now, within my template I use the tag {{ STATIC_URL }}, and it correctly renders to /static/. However, using the tag {{ STATIC_URL }}css/style.css results in a 404 error. I'm using the 'runserver' command as the server. Am I missing something here?"

        "content": "It looks like there might be a few reasons why you're encountering this issue. Let's go through some potential solutions and checks:\n\n1. **Use the `{% static %}` Template Tag:**\n   In Django templates, instead of directly using `{{ STATIC_URL }}css/style.css`, you should use the `{% static %}` template tag to ensure the correct file path is rendered. Update your template code like this:\n   ```html\n   <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"{% static 'css/style.css' %}\">\n   ```\n\n2. **Check the STATICFILES_DIRS Setting:**\n   Make sure you have the `STATICFILES_DIRS` setting configured if your static files are not directly within the app directories. This setting should include the paths to your static file directories:\n   ```python\n   STATICFILES_DIRS = [\n       '/Users/kevdotbadger/django/mylook/static/',\n   ]\n   ```\n\n3. **Development vs. Production:**\n   Remember that `STATIC_ROOT` is used during production for collecting static files via the `collectstatic` command. For development with `runserver`, you should ensure that your static files are either in `STATICFILES_DIRS` or within each app's `static` subdirectory.\n\n4. **Run `collectstatic`:**\n   If you are preparing for deployment and want to test with `STATIC_ROOT`, run the following command to collect all static files into the directory specified by `STATIC_ROOT`:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py collectstatic\n   ```\n\n5. **Ensure File Existence:**\n   Check to ensure that the file `css/style.css` actually exists in one of the locations specified in `STATICFILES_DIRS` or within the `static` subdirectory of one of your apps.\n\n6. **Debugging:**\n   If you've made changes to your settings, try restarting the `runserver` to ensure all configurations are reloaded.\n\n7. **Check URL Paths:**\n   Verify that the path `/static/css/style.css` is correctly mapped and accessible in the browser. You can manually check if the file is served by navigating to `http://localhost:8000/static/css/style.css`.\n\n8. **Django Version Considerations:**\n   Ensure you're using the correct Django version-specific syntax or settings, as older or newer versions may have different best practices.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with Django's static file handling. Let me know if you need further assistance!"
