I have followed the instructions provided in the Amazon documentation and built my lambda function. I have fired an Amazon Linux EC2 instance, scp the resulting tarball to my laptop and built a zip archive. I have also uploaded the resulting archive to S3 to be the source of my lambda function. However, when I test the function, I encounter the error `'module' object has no attribute 'core': AttributeError` and Python seems to not find the core directory that is present in the folder structure. I have tried reducing the lambda function, but I get a new error stating `Error importing numpy: you should not try to import numpy from its source directory; please exit the numpy source tree, and relaunch your python interpreter from there.: ImportError`. How can I resolve these issues and successfully use scipy, numpy, and moviepy in AWS Lambda?"

        "content": "To successfully run `moviepy`, `scipy`, and `numpy` on AWS Lambda, you'll need to ensure that all dependencies are packaged correctly and compatible with the Lambda environment. Here are some steps and tips that might help you resolve the issues you're encountering:\n\n1. **Ensure Compatibility**: AWS Lambda uses Amazon Linux, so ensure that the versions of your libraries are compatible with this environment. You can specify compatible versions in your requirements file or when installing the libraries.\n\n2. **Use a Linux Environment for Packaging**: If you're packaging your dependencies on a different OS (e.g., Windows or macOS), you may run into compatibility issues. It's best to package your application on an Amazon Linux EC2 instance or use a Docker container that simulates the Lambda environment.\n\n3. **Virtual Environment**: Create a virtual environment in your Amazon Linux EC2 instance. Install `moviepy`, `scipy`, and `numpy` within this virtual environment. This ensures that the dependencies are isolated and correctly compiled for the Linux environment.\n\n4. **Package Your Lambda Layer**:\n   - After installing the dependencies in the virtual environment, navigate to the `site-packages` directory.\n   - Zip the contents of this directory, ensuring the folder structure is maintained.\n   - Upload this zip file as a Lambda Layer. This allows you to keep your Lambda function's deployment package size small and manage dependencies separately.\n\n5. **Lambda Function Code**: Ensure that your Lambda function code imports the libraries correctly. You should have something like this in your handler function:\n\n    ```python\n    import moviepy.editor as mp\n    import numpy as np\n    import scipy\n    ```\n\n6. **Test the Layer**: Attach the Lambda Layer to your function and test it. If you encounter errors, check the CloudWatch logs for detailed error messages.\n\n7. **Debugging Tips**:\n   - If you see an error like `'module' object has no attribute 'core'`, it might be due to package conflicts or incorrect installations. Ensure that `numpy` is not being imported from its source directory.\n   - The error `you should not try to import numpy from its source directory` suggests that the Python path might be including the source directory by mistake. Check your environment variables and paths.\n\n8. **Check for Known Issues**: Sometimes, specific versions of libraries might have known issues. Check the GitHub repositories or forums for any reported issues and solutions.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issues and successfully use `moviepy`, `scipy`, and `numpy` in your AWS Lambda function."
