These include:\n\n1. **Wedge**: A device that is thick at one end and tapers to a thin edge at the other, used for cutting or splitting.\n\n2. **Wheel and Axle**: A larger wheel attached to a smaller axle so that these two parts rotate together, allowing for easier movement of objects.\n\n3. **Screw**: An inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder or cone, used to hold objects together or lift materials.\n\nHere's the R code snippet you provided with these examples:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nmechanical_devices <- c(\"wedge\", \"wheel and axle\", \"screw\")\nmechanical_devices %>% paste(collapse = \", \")\n```\n\nThis code will output the string: `\"wedge, wheel and axle, screw\"`."
