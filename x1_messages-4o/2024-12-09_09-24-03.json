Let's assume you have a table named `people` with columns `name` and `city`. The SQL query would look like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT name\nFROM people\nWHERE city = 'New York';\n```\n\nThis query selects the `name` column from the `people` table where the `city` column matches 'New York'. Ensure that your database schema matches this structure for the query to work correctly."
