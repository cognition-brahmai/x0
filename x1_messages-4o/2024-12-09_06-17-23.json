Here's a simple way to achieve this using the `split` method:\n\n```python\ndef remove_after_dots(s):\n    return s.split('...')[0]\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_string = \"This is an example string...with some text after dots.\"\nresult = remove_after_dots(input_string)\nprint(result)  # Output: \"This is an example string\"\n```\n\nThe `split('...')` method splits the string into a list wherever `'...'` appears. By taking the first element `[0]` of this list, you get the part of the string before the `'...'`. This works efficiently even if the text after the dots varies."
