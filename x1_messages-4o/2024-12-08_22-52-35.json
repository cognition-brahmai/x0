        "content": "To calculate the total cost for a family of four to attend a theme park for a week, we need to consider both the daily ticket prices and the stroller rental cost.\n\n### Assumptions:\n1. The base ticket price for one person on the first day is \\( X \\).\n2. The price increases by 5% each day.\n3. Stroller rental is $15 per day.\n\n### Calculations:\n\n**1. Daily Ticket Price for One Person:**\n\n- Day 1: \\( X \\)\n- Day 2: \\( X \\times 1.05 \\)\n- Day 3: \\( X \\times 1.05^2 \\)\n- Day 4: \\( X \\times 1.05^3 \\)\n- Day 5: \\( X \\times 1.05^4 \\)\n- Day 6: \\( X \\times 1.05^5 \\)\n- Day 7: \\( X \\times 1.05^6 \\)\n\n**2. Total Ticket Cost for One Person:**\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Total Ticket Cost for One Person} = X + X \\times 1.05 + X \\times 1.05^2 + X \\times 1.05^3 + X \\times 1.05^4 + X \\times 1.05^5 + X \\times 1.05^6 \n\\]\n\nThis can be written using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Total Ticket Cost for One Person} = X \\times \\frac{1.05^7 - 1}{1.05 - 1} \n\\]\n\n**3. Total Ticket Cost for Four People:**\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Total Ticket Cost for Four People} = 4 \\times X \\times \\frac{1.05^7 - 1}{0.05} \n\\]\n\n**4. Total Stroller Rental Cost:**\n\nSince the stroller rental is $15 per day for 7 days:\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Total Stroller Rental Cost} = 15 \\times 7 = 105 \n\\]\n\n**5. Total Cost for the Family:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cost} = 4 \\times X \\times \\frac{1.05^7 - 1}{0.05} + 105 \n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTo determine the exact total cost, you need to know the base ticket price \\( X \\). Once you have that, you can substitute \\( X \\) into the formulas above to find the total cost for the family."
