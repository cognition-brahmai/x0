I have a script that seems to run without any errors, but when I check the table in the database, it's empty. The CSV file contains three columns of data that I want to insert into the MySQL table. Here's my code:\n\n```python\nimport csv\nimport MySQLdb\n\nmydb = MySQLdb.connect(host='localhost',\n    user='root',\n    passwd='',\n    db='mydb')\ncursor = mydb.cursor()\n\ncsv_data = csv.reader(file('students.csv'))\nfor row in csv_data:\n\n    cursor.execute('INSERT INTO testcsv(names, \\\n          classes, mark )' \\\n          'VALUES(\"%s\", \"%s\", \"%s\")', \n          row)\n#close the connection to the database.\ncursor.close()\nprint \"Done\"\n```\nWhy are the insertions not happening even though no error message is thrown? I would appreciate any help or insight into what I might be missing."

        "content": "There are a few potential reasons why your data isn't being inserted into the MySQL database, even though your script is running without errors. Here are some things to check and try:\n\n1. **Autocommit Mode**: By default, MySQLdb does not autocommit transactions. This means that you need to explicitly commit the transaction after executing your INSERT statements. You can do this by calling `mydb.commit()` after your `for` loop.\n\n2. **File Handling**: The way you're opening the CSV file might be causing an issue. The `file` function is not available in Python 3, and even in Python 2, it's better to use the `open` function. Make sure you are using the correct file opening method for your Python version. If you're using Python 3, you should replace `file('students.csv')` with `open('students.csv', newline='')`.\n\n3. **String Formatting**: Using Python's string interpolation with `%s` placeholders is correct here, but ensure that the data you're reading from the CSV matches the expected format and types in your MySQL table.\n\n4. **CSV File Path**: Ensure that the file path to your `students.csv` is correct. If the file is not in the same directory as your script, you'll need to provide the full path.\n\n5. **Check the Table**: Double-check that the `testcsv` table in your `mydb` database is correctly set up with columns `names`, `classes`, and `mark`.\n\nHere's an updated version of your script with these considerations:\n\n```python\nimport csv\nimport MySQLdb\n\nmydb = MySQLdb.connect(\n    host='localhost',\n    user='root',\n    passwd='',\n    db='mydb'\n)\ncursor = mydb.cursor()\n\n# Open CSV file\nwith open('students.csv', newline='') as csvfile:\n    csv_data = csv.reader(csvfile)\n    for row in csv_data:\n        cursor.execute('INSERT INTO testcsv(names, classes, mark) VALUES(%s, %s, %s)', row)\n\n# Commit the transaction\nmydb.commit()\n\n# Close the connection to the database.\ncursor.close()\nmydb.close()\n\nprint(\"Done\")\n```\n\nMake sure to handle exceptions and errors in your real-world applications to make debugging easier. Adding a try-except block around your database operations can help you catch and understand any issues that might occur."
