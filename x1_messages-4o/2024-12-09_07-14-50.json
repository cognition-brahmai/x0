I am using pandas 0.13.1 and here is my test code:\n```python\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'a': range(5), 'b': range(5) })\n\n# let's insert some -1 values\ndf['a'][1] = -1\ndf['b'][1] = -1\ndf['a'][3] = -1\ndf['b'][4] = -1\n\ndf1 = df[(df.a != -1) & (df.b != -1)]\ndf2 = df[(df.a != -1) | (df.b != -1)]\n\nprint(pd.concat([df, df1, df2], axis=1,\n                keys = [ 'original df', 'using AND (&)', 'using OR (|)',]))\n```\nThe result I get is:\n```python\n      original df      using AND (&)      using OR (|)    \n             a  b              a   b             a   b\n0            0  0              0   0             0   0\n1           -1 -1            NaN NaN           NaN NaN\n2            2  2              2   2             2   2\n3           -1  3            NaN NaN            -1   3\n4            4 -1            NaN NaN             4  -1\n\n[5 rows x 6 columns]\n```\nAs you can see, the AND operator drops every row in which at least one value equals -1. On the other hand, the OR operator requires both values to be equal to -1 to drop them. I would expect exactly the opposite result. Could anyone explain this behavior?"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is actually consistent with how logical operators work, particularly in the context of filtering with `pandas`. Let's break down the logic of the filtering conditions:\n\n1. **AND Operator (`&`)**:\n   - The condition `(df.a != -1) & (df.b != -1)` is used to filter rows.\n   - This condition will only return `True` for rows where both `a` and `b` are not equal to `-1`.\n   - If either column `a` or column `b` has a value of `-1`, the entire condition evaluates to `False` for that row, hence the row is dropped.\n\n2. **OR Operator (`|`)**:\n   - The condition `(df.a != -1) | (df.b != -1)` is used for filtering.\n   - This condition will return `True` for rows where at least one of `a` or `b` is not equal to `-1`.\n   - A row is only dropped if both `a` and `b` are `-1`.\n\nLet's apply this logic to your DataFrame:\n\n- **Row 0**: `a = 0`, `b = 0`\n  - AND: `True` (both are not `-1`)\n  - OR: `True` (both are not `-1`)\n\n- **Row 1**: `a = -1`, `b = -1`\n  - AND: `False` (both are `-1`)\n  - OR: `False` (both are `-1`)\n\n- **Row 2**: `a = 2`, `b = 2`\n  - AND: `True` (both are not `-1`)\n  - OR: `True` (both are not `-1`)\n\n- **Row 3**: `a = -1`, `b = 3`\n  - AND: `False` (`a` is `-1`)\n  - OR: `True` (at least one is not `-1`)\n\n- **Row 4**: `a = 4`, `b = -1`\n  - AND: `False` (`b` is `-1`)\n  - OR: `True` (at least one is not `-1`)\n\nThis is why you see the results in your output. The AND condition is more restrictive, dropping rows unless both conditions are met, while the OR condition is more inclusive, retaining rows unless both conditions are not met."
