Here are a few methods:\n\n1. **Directly Including the Character**:\n   You can directly include the degree symbol in your string if your text editor supports Unicode characters.\n\n   ```python\n   temperature = \"25\u00b0C\"\n   print(temperature)\n   ```\n\n2. **Using Unicode Escape Sequence**:\n   You can use the Unicode escape sequence for the degree symbol, which is `\\u00B0`.\n\n   ```python\n   temperature = \"25\\u00B0C\"\n   print(temperature)\n   ```\n\n3. **Using the `chr()` Function**:\n   The `chr()` function can be used to convert a Unicode code point to its corresponding character.\n\n   ```python\n   degree_symbol = chr(176)  # 176 is the ASCII code for the degree symbol\n   temperature = f\"25{degree_symbol}C\"\n   print(temperature)\n   ```\n\n4. **Using String Formatting**:\n   If you're using formatted strings, you can include the degree symbol using its Unicode code point.\n\n   ```python\n   temperature = \"{}\\u00B0C\".format(25)\n   print(temperature)\n   ```\n\nAll these methods will display the degree symbol correctly in your Python strings."
