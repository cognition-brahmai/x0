My current approach involves processing the text file line by line until I reach the desired line, but this seems inefficient considering the size of the file (approximately 15MB). Is there a more efficient alternative to the following code?\n\n```\nstartFromLine = 141978 # or whatever line I need to jump to\n\nurlsfile = open(filename, \"rb\", 0)\n\nlinesCounter = 1\n\nfor line in urlsfile:\n    if linesCounter > startFromLine:\n        DoSomethingWithThisLine(line)\n\n    linesCounter += 1\n```"

        "content": "To efficiently navigate to a specific line in a large text file, you can try using a combination of `itertools` and `islice` from Python's standard library. This approach allows you to quickly skip to the desired line without manually iterating over each line until reaching the target. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import islice\n\nstartFromLine = 141978  # The line number you want to jump to\n\nwith open(filename, \"rb\") as urlsfile:\n    for line in islice(urlsfile, startFromLine, None):\n        DoSomethingWithThisLine(line)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`islice`**: This function from the `itertools` module allows you to efficiently slice an iterator (in this case, the file object) and skip directly to the desired line number. It takes three arguments: the iterable (your file object), the start index (line number you want to jump to), and the stop index (use `None` to iterate until the end).\n\nBy using `islice`, you avoid the overhead of manually counting lines and checking conditions in every iteration, which should improve performance, especially with large files."
