The current setup requires me to scroll to the bottom or create new cells where I need a 'console-like' text field. Can I have a permanent console window, for example at the bottom of the window?"

        "content": "Yes, you can display a console within a Jupyter notebook using the `%qtconsole` magic command, which opens an IPython console connected to the kernel of your Jupyter notebook. However, this console opens in a separate window, not embedded within the notebook interface itself.\n\nFor a more integrated approach, you can use the JupyterLab interface, which offers more flexibility in terms of layout compared to the classic Jupyter Notebook. JupyterLab allows you to open a terminal or a console panel alongside your notebook.\n\nHere are some steps you can follow to achieve a console-like environment in JupyterLab:\n\n1. **Install JupyterLab**: If you haven't already installed JupyterLab, you can do so by running:\n   ```\n   pip install jupyterlab\n   ```\n\n2. **Launch JupyterLab**: Start JupyterLab by running:\n   ```\n   jupyter lab\n   ```\n\n3. **Open a Console**: In JupyterLab, you can right-click on your notebook in the file browser and select \"New Console for Notebook\". This will open a console window that is connected to the same kernel as your notebook.\n\n4. **Arrange Panels**: You can drag and drop the console to arrange it at the bottom of your JupyterLab interface, providing a permanent console-like experience within the same window as your notebook.\n\nBy using JupyterLab, you can achieve a more flexible and powerful interactive environment, combining the benefits of both notebooks and console interfaces."
