The code is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nn = 0\nwhile n <= 50:\n  n = n+1\n  a = random.randint(1, 16)\n  b = random.randint(1, 5)\n  print n, \". \", a, \"-\", b, \"= \"\n```\n\nHowever, when I try to run this, I encounter the error: `AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'randint'`. I don't understand why this is happening because when I use the random.randint function in IDLE, I don't face any issues. Can anyone help me fix this problem?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, `AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'randint'`, suggests that there might be another issue with your environment, such as a naming conflict. Here are a few things you can check and try to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check for Conflicting Names**: Ensure that there are no other files named `random.py` in your working directory. Python might be trying to import from this file instead of the standard library's `random` module, leading to the error.\n\n2. **Check for `random.pyc`**: If you have previously run a file named `random.py`, it might have created a `random.pyc` file. Delete this file if it exists.\n\n3. **Correct Syntax for Print (Python 3)**: If you're using Python 3, make sure to use parentheses with the `print` function. Your `print` statement should look like this:\n   ```python\n   print(n, \". \", a, \"-\", b, \"= \")\n   ```\n\n4. **Re-importing the Module**: Sometimes, clearing the Python environment and re-importing can help. You can restart your IDE or Python interpreter and try running the code again.\n\n5. **Verify Python Environment**: Ensure that you are running the code in the same environment where `random.randint` works properly. If you've set up a virtual environment, make sure that it's activated.\n\nHere's the corrected version of your code assuming you're using Python 3:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nn = 0\nwhile n <= 50:\n    n = n + 1\n    a = random.randint(1, 16)\n    b = random.randint(1, 5)\n    print(n, \". \", a, \"-\", b, \"= \")\n```\n\nIf none of the above solutions work, please check your Python installation and environment settings to ensure there are no other conflicts."
