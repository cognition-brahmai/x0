        "content": "As of my last update in October 2023, there are a few SOAP libraries in Python that support both client and server-side operations. Here are some of the most notable ones:\n\n1. **Zeep**:\n   - **Client-side**: Zeep is a modern SOAP client for Python. It provides an easy-to-use API and supports complex SOAP web services with ease. It uses the requests library for HTTP requests.\n   - **Server-side**: While primarily a client, you can use Zeep in combination with other frameworks to handle server-side SOAP requests.\n\n2. **Spyne**:\n   - **Client-side**: Spyne can be used to create clients for SOAP services.\n   - **Server-side**: Spyne is a powerful library for creating SOAP (and other types of) web services. It integrates well with various Python web frameworks.\n\n3. **Sudsy**:\n   - **Client-side**: Sudsy is a fork of the original suds library, which was one of the first major SOAP libraries for Python. It's maintained and modernized to work with Python 3.x.\n   - **Server-side**: Sudsy itself is primarily a client library, but you can integrate it for server-side tasks with additional frameworks.\n\n4. **soapfish**:\n   - **Client-side**: Soapfish can be used to work with SOAP web services on the client side.\n   - **Server-side**: Soapfish also allows you to create SOAP web services.\n\n5. **pysimplesoap**:\n   - **Client-side**: A lightweight SOAP library for creating clients.\n   - **Server-side**: Provides basic server-side SOAP service capabilities.\n\nWhen choosing a library, consider factors such as the complexity of the SOAP service you need to work with, the level of community support and maintenance, and how well the library integrates with other tools and frameworks you might be using."
