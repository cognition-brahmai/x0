I attempted to use `ent.delete(0, END)`, but I received an error stating that strings don't have the attribute delete. I encountered this error when using `real.delete(0, END)`. Could someone help me solve this issue? Below is my code for reference:\n\n``` python\nsecret = randrange(1,100)\nprint(secret)\ndef res(real, secret):\n    if secret==eval(real):\n        showinfo(message='that is right!')\n    real.delete(0, END)\n\ndef guess():\n    ge = Tk()\n    ge.title('guessing game')\n\n    Label(ge, text=\"what is your guess:\").pack(side=TOP)\n\n    ent = Entry(ge)\n    ent.pack(side=TOP)\n\n    btn=Button(ge, text=\"Enter\", command=lambda: res(ent.get(),secret))\n    btn.pack(side=LEFT)\n\n    ge.mainloop()\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is because you're trying to call the `delete` method on a string, which does not have this method. The `get` method of the `Entry` widget returns a string, so when you do `ent.get()`, you're actually getting the content of the entry as a string, not the entry widget itself.\n\nTo fix this, you need to pass the `Entry` widget itself to the `res` function and then call `delete` on it. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nfrom tkinter import Tk, Label, Entry, Button, TOP, LEFT, END\nfrom tkinter.messagebox import showinfo\nfrom random import randrange\n\nsecret = randrange(1, 100)\nprint(secret)\n\ndef res(entry_widget, secret):\n    real = entry_widget.get()\n    if secret == eval(real):\n        showinfo(message='that is right!')\n    entry_widget.delete(0, END)\n\ndef guess():\n    ge = Tk()\n    ge.title('guessing game')\n\n    Label(ge, text=\"What is your guess:\").pack(side=TOP)\n\n    ent = Entry(ge)\n    ent.pack(side=TOP)\n\n    btn = Button(ge, text=\"Enter\", command=lambda: res(ent, secret))\n    btn.pack(side=LEFT)\n\n    ge.mainloop()\n\nguess()\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Pass the `Entry` widget directly to the `res` function**: When creating the `Button`, pass the `Entry` widget `ent` instead of `ent.get()` to the `res` function. This allows you to manipulate the widget itself inside the function.\n\n2. **Retrieve the entry content inside the `res` function**: Get the string from the `Entry` widget using `entry_widget.get()` inside the `res` function.\n\n3. **Call `delete` on the `Entry` widget**: Use `entry_widget.delete(0, END)` to clear the contents of the `Entry` widget.\n\nThese changes will resolve the error and allow you to clear the entry box correctly after the button is pressed."
