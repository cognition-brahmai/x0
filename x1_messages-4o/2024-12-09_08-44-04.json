Are there any benefits to having 'assert' as a statement rather than a function? According to Python's documentation, 'assert expression1, expression2' expands to:\n\n```\nif __debug__:\n    if not expression1: raise AssertionError(expression2)\n```\n\nThe documentation also mentions that when optimization is requested at compile time, no code is emitted for an assert statement. It seems like a special case was required to enable this. However, couldn't a special case also be used to optimize away calls to an 'assert()' function? \n\nIf 'assert' were a function, we could write:\n\n```\nassert(some_long_condition,\n       \"explanation\")\n```\nBut since 'assert' is a statement, the tuple always evaluates to 'True' and we get a 'SyntaxWarning: assertion is always true, perhaps remove parentheses?' \n\nThe correct way seems to be:\n\n```\nassert some_long_condition, \\\n       \"explanation\"\n```\nWhich can be argued as being less elegant. Why is this so?"

        "content": "The decision to make `assert` a statement rather than a function in Python was indeed a conscious design choice by the language's creator, Guido van Rossum. There are several reasons and benefits associated with this decision:\n\n1. **Optimization**: One of the key reasons for making `assert` a statement is the ability to optimize it out of existence when running Python with optimization flags (e.g., using the `-O` flag). When Python is run in optimized mode, the `assert` statements can be completely removed from the compiled bytecode, thus having zero runtime overhead. If `assert` were a function, it would be much more complex to wholly eliminate the function call and its associated code, especially since function calls in Python have inherent overhead.\n\n2. **Simplicity and Readability**: `assert` as a statement is more aligned with its intended use as a debugging aid rather than a runtime feature. It's a way to enforce that certain conditions hold true during development. Statements in Python are generally more readable and aligned with control flow constructs, making `assert` fit naturally into the language's syntax.\n\n3. **Avoiding Common Mistakes**: If `assert` were a function, it might encourage developers to use it in contexts where it wasn't intended, such as in production code where conditions need to be checked at runtime. As a statement, it clearly signals that it's meant for debugging purposes and can be disabled in production environments.\n\n4. **Syntax and Semantics**: The syntax for `assert` as a statement is straightforward and avoids potential pitfalls related to function calls. For example, using a tuple in a function call could lead to unintended behavior if the developer mistakenly uses parentheses, as you mentioned. As a statement, the syntax encourages correct usage without such pitfalls.\n\n5. **Consistency with Other Languages**: Many other languages that feature assertions (such as C and Java) implement them as statements or keywords rather than functions. This consistency helps developers coming from other languages understand and use assertions correctly in Python.\n\nIn summary, making `assert` a statement rather than a function provides clear benefits in terms of optimization, usage intent, and readability. While it might require some adjustment in syntax, the overall design choice aligns with Python's philosophy of simplicity and explicitness."
