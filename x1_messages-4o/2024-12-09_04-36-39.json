        "content": "Yes, it is feasible to use both AngularJS and Jinja2 together, even though they both use double curly braces `{{ }}` as delimiters. To resolve this conflict, you can configure AngularJS to use a different set of delimiters. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Change AngularJS Delimiters:**\n\n   You can change the AngularJS interpolation symbols to avoid conflict with Jinja2. This is done by configuring AngularJS to use a different symbol for its expressions. For example, you can use `[[]]` instead of `{{}}`.\n\n   Here\u2019s how you can configure AngularJS to use different delimiters:\n\n   ```javascript\n   var app = angular.module('myApp', [], function($interpolateProvider) {\n       $interpolateProvider.startSymbol('[[');\n       $interpolateProvider.endSymbol(']]');\n   });\n   ```\n\n   In this configuration, AngularJS will now use `[[ ]]` as its delimiters.\n\n2. **Usage in HTML:**\n\n   After changing the delimiters, you can use AngularJS expressions in your HTML files like this:\n\n   ```html\n   <div>\n       Jinja2 Variable: {{ jinja_variable }}\n       AngularJS Variable: [[ angular_variable ]]\n   </div>\n   ```\n\n3. **Server-Side Output:**\n\n   Make sure that when you render the templates on the server side, you are correctly distinguishing between what is meant for Jinja2 and what is meant for AngularJS.\n\nBy changing AngularJS's delimiters, you can effectively use both AngularJS and Jinja2 in the same project without any conflicts. This allows you to leverage the capabilities of both the frontend framework and the backend template engine."
