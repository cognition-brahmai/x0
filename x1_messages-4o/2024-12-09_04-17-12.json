I initially tried to install it by cloning from Git, but I encountered an error stating \"no module named copyreg.\" So, I switched to using a virtualenv. However, I encountered another error when I ran the command: \n\n```\npip install https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/tensorflow-0.5.0-py2-none-any.whl\n```\n\nThe error message stated: \n\n```\ntensorflow-0.5.0-py2-none-any.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.\n```\n\nI am unsure if pip differentiates between Python 3.4.3 and Python 2.7, and if so, how to switch between them. This issue was not listed under the common problems section. Can you help me resolve this?"

        "content": "To resolve the issue of installing TensorFlow on macOS Yosemite with Python 3.4.3 and Python 2.7, you'll need to ensure that the correct version of Python and pip are being used. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get TensorFlow installed:\n\n1. **Verify Python Version:**\n   First, check which Python version is currently active in your environment:\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   python3 --version\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify Pip Version:**\n   It's crucial to ensure that pip corresponds to the correct Python version. Check which pip is being used:\n   ```bash\n   pip --version\n   pip3 --version\n   ```\n\n3. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**\n   It\u2019s a good practice to install TensorFlow within a virtual environment to manage dependencies cleanly.\n\n   For Python 2.7:\n   ```bash\n   virtualenv --python=python2.7 venv\n   source venv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n   For Python 3.4:\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m venv venv\n   source venv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n4. **Upgrade Pip:**\n   Make sure pip is up to date within the virtual environment:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade pip\n   ```\n\n5. **Install TensorFlow:**\n   TensorFlow 0.5.0 might not be compatible with your OS or Python versions. Consider installing a more recent version compatible with your setup. Use the following command to install a specific version:\n\n   For Python 2.7 (though it's deprecated and not recommended):\n   ```bash\n   pip install tensorflow==1.5.0\n   ```\n\n   For Python 3.4.3, TensorFlow may not support this version either, so upgrading Python might be necessary.\n\n6. **Switching Between Python Versions:**\n   If you want to explicitly use Python 2.7 or 3.4, ensure you activate the appropriate environment (as shown above) before running any pip install commands.\n\n7. **Troubleshooting:**\n   If you encounter issues related to wheel compatibility, verify that you are using the correct pip version inside the virtual environment by checking the Python version and pip version again.\n\n8. **Consider Upgrading:**\n   If possible, consider upgrading your macOS and Python versions. Newer versions of TensorFlow require more recent Python versions (3.6 or higher).\n\nBy ensuring you are using the correct Python environment and pip version, you should be able to successfully install TensorFlow. If you continue to experience issues, consider checking TensorFlow's official installation guides or community forums for more specific compatibility advice."
