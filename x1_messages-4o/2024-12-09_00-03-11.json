        "content": "To display an image using C++, you typically need a graphics library that can handle image files and display them in a window. One of the popular libraries for this purpose is the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) or OpenCV. Below, I'll provide a basic example using SDL2 to load and display an image like Andy Warhol's \"Campbell's Soup Can (Tomato)\" in high resolution with a minimum width of 800 pixels.\n\nFirst, make sure you have SDL2 installed on your system. You can usually install it via a package manager or download it from the SDL website.\n\nHere's a basic example using SDL2:\n\n```cpp\n#include <SDL2/SDL.h>\n#include <SDL2/SDL_image.h>\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main(int argc, char* argv[]) {\n    if (SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO) < 0) {\n        std::cerr << \"SDL could not initialize! SDL_Error: \" << SDL_GetError() << std::endl;\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    SDL_Window* window = SDL_CreateWindow(\"Andy Warhol's Campbell's Soup Can\",\n                                          SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED,\n                                          SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED,\n                                          800, // Minimum width\n                                          600, // Arbitrary height\n                                          SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN);\n    if (!window) {\n        std::cerr << \"Window could not be created! SDL_Error: \" << SDL_GetError() << std::endl;\n        SDL_Quit();\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    SDL_Renderer* renderer = SDL_CreateRenderer(window, -1, SDL_RENDERER_ACCELERATED);\n    if (!renderer) {\n        std::cerr << \"Renderer could not be created! SDL Error: \" << SDL_GetError() << std::endl;\n        SDL_DestroyWindow(window);\n        SDL_Quit();\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    int imgFlags = IMG_INIT_JPG | IMG_INIT_PNG;\n    if (!(IMG_Init(imgFlags) & imgFlags)) {\n        std::cerr << \"SDL_image could not initialize! SDL_image Error: \" << IMG_GetError() << std::endl;\n        SDL_DestroyRenderer(renderer);\n        SDL_DestroyWindow(window);\n        SDL_Quit();\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    SDL_Surface* loadedSurface = IMG_Load(\"campbells_soup_can_tomato.jpg\");\n    if (!loadedSurface) {\n        std::cerr << \"Unable to load image! SDL_image Error: \" << IMG_GetError() << std::endl;\n        IMG_Quit();\n        SDL_DestroyRenderer(renderer);\n        SDL_DestroyWindow(window);\n        SDL_Quit();\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    SDL_Texture* texture = SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface(renderer, loadedSurface);\n    SDL_FreeSurface(loadedSurface);\n    if (!texture) {\n        std::cerr << \"Unable to create texture from image! SDL Error: \" << SDL_GetError() << std::endl;\n        IMG_Quit();\n        SDL_DestroyRenderer(renderer);\n        SDL_DestroyWindow(window);\n        SDL_Quit();\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    SDL_RenderClear(renderer);\n    SDL_RenderCopy(renderer, texture, NULL, NULL); // Render the image to the entire window\n    SDL_RenderPresent(renderer);\n\n    SDL_Event e;\n    bool quit = false;\n    while (!quit) {\n        while (SDL_PollEvent(&e) != 0) {\n            if (e.type == SDL_QUIT) {\n                quit = true;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    SDL_DestroyTexture(texture);\n    IMG_Quit();\n    SDL_DestroyRenderer(renderer);\n    SDL_DestroyWindow(window);\n    SDL_Quit();\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Image Loading**: The code uses SDL_image to load JPEG or PNG files. Make sure the file path is correct.\n2. **Resolution Management**: The window is created with a minimum width of 800 pixels. You can adjust the height as needed. The `SDL_RenderCopy` function can be used to scale the image if needed.\n3. **Enhancements**: For enhanced image processing, you might consider using OpenCV, which offers more advanced features like filtering, transformations, and more complex rendering tasks.\n\n### Additional Enhancements:\n- **Zoom and Pan**: Implement zooming and panning functionality by manipulating the source and destination rectangles in `SDL_RenderCopy`.\n- **Filters and Effects**: If using OpenCV, apply filters (e.g., Gaussian blur, sharpening) before converting the image to a texture.\n- **Aspect Ratio Maintenance**: Calculate aspect ratio and adjust the destination rectangle to maintain the aspect ratio during rendering.\n\nEnsure you link against SDL2 and SDL2_image when compiling this code."
