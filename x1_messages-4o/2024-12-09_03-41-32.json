I have tried using IronPython but experienced too many issues with unsupported CPython library my Python code is using. Now, I'm looking to try the other way around and call my C# code from Python. Here is the C# code I'm working with:\n\n```csharp\nusing System.Runtime.InteropServices;\nusing System.EnterpriseServices;\n\nnamespace DataViewerLibrary\n{\n    public interface ISimpleProvider\n    {\n       [DispIdAttribute(0)]\n       void Start();\n    }\n\n    [ComVisible(true)]\n    [ClassInterface(ClassInterfaceType.None)]\n    public class PlotData : ServicedComponent, ISimpleProvider\n    {\n       public void Start()\n       {\n          Plot plotter = new Plot();\n          plotter.ShowDialog();\n       }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlotter, in this case, is a WPF window that plots an Ellipse. However, I'm not sure how to call this code from my Python application. Any suggestions on how to do this?"

        "content": "To call a C# library, especially one involving WPF, from Python, you can use the `pythonnet` library, which allows you to run .NET code from Python. Here's a step-by-step guide to set this up:\n\n### Step 1: Expose Your C# Library as a COM Object\n\n1. **Register the C# Assembly for COM Interop:**\n   - Ensure your C# project is set to \"Register for COM interop\" in the project properties under the \"Build\" tab.\n   - Make sure all necessary attributes for COM visibility are set, which seems to be the case in your code with `[ComVisible(true)]`.\n\n2. **Compile and Register the Assembly:**\n   - Compile your C# library.\n   - Register your compiled DLL using `regasm` (usually found in the .NET Framework directory). Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run:\n     ```bash\n     regasm /codebase /tlb yourlibrary.dll\n     ```\n\n### Step 2: Call the COM Object from Python\n\n1. **Install pythonnet:**\n   - Install the `pythonnet` package, which enables you to interface with .NET from Python.\n     ```bash\n     pip install pythonnet\n     ```\n\n2. **Write Python Code to Use the COM Object:**\n\nHere's a sample Python script to call your COM-exposed C# library:\n\n```python\nimport clr\nfrom System import Type\nfrom System.Runtime.InteropServices import Marshal\n\n# Load the COM object\ncom_type = Type.GetTypeFromProgID(\"DataViewerLibrary.PlotData\")\ncom_object = Marshal.GetActiveObject(\"DataViewerLibrary.PlotData\")\n\n# Cast the COM object to your interface and call the method\nsimple_provider = clr.Cast(com_object, com_type)\nsimple_provider.Start()\n```\n\n### Step 3: Additional Considerations\n\n- **32-bit vs 64-bit:** Ensure that your Python and .NET components match in terms of architecture (both should be either 32-bit or 64-bit).\n\n- **Permissions:** Always run the registration and your Python script with administrative privileges if you encounter any permission issues.\n\n- **Error Handling:** Handle any errors that might arise, particularly around COM registration and access.\n\nThis setup should allow you to call your WPF-based C# library from Python, leveraging COM interop and `pythonnet`. If you encounter specific errors, ensure your COM registration is correct and confirm the library is properly exposed and accessible."
