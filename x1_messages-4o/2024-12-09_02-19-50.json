        "content": "To create a shared global variable that can be accessed by all threads in your Python project, you can use the `threading` module instead of the `thread` module, as it provides a more convenient and high-level threading interface. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n1. **Define a global variable**: You'll need a global variable that can be accessed by all threads.\n\n2. **Use a Lock for synchronization**: To ensure that only one thread can access or modify the variable at a time, use a `Lock` from the `threading` module. This prevents race conditions.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport threading\n\n# Global variable\nshared_variable = False\n\n# Lock for synchronizing access to the shared variable\nlock = threading.Lock()\n\ndef thread_function(thread_id):\n    global shared_variable\n\n    # Acquire the lock before accessing the shared variable\n    with lock:\n        # Read the shared variable\n        print(f\"Thread {thread_id}: Reading shared_variable = {shared_variable}\")\n\n        # Modify the shared variable\n        shared_variable = not shared_variable\n        print(f\"Thread {thread_id}: Modified shared_variable to = {shared_variable}\")\n\n# Create and start threads\nthreads = []\nfor i in range(4):  # 4 threads in this example\n    t = threading.Thread(target=thread_function, args=(i,))\n    threads.append(t)\n    t.start()\n\n# Wait for all threads to complete\nfor t in threads:\n    t.join()\n\nprint(\"Final value of shared_variable:\", shared_variable)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Global Variable**: `shared_variable` is used to store the boolean value that all threads will read and modify.\n- **Lock**: `lock` is used to ensure that only one thread can access the `shared_variable` at a time, preventing race conditions.\n- **Thread Function**: `thread_function` reads and modifies the `shared_variable`. It uses the lock to ensure safe access.\n- **Thread Creation and Management**: Threads are created and started. We wait for all threads to complete using `join()`.\n\nThis approach allows the `shared_variable` to be accessed safely across multiple threads, ensuring the integrity of its value."
