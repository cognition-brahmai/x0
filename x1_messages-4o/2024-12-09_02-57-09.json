        "content": "To retrieve values from asyncio tasks in Python, you can use the `asyncio.gather` function to run multiple coroutines concurrently and collect their return values. Additionally, the `asyncio.create_task` function is used to create tasks in recent versions of Python.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to get the returned values from the functions:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\n# Define the asynchronous function using async def syntax\nasync def func_normal():\n    print(\"A\")\n    await asyncio.sleep(5)\n    print(\"B\")\n    return 'saad'\n\nasync def func_infinite():\n    i = 0\n    while i < 10:\n        print(\"--\" + str(i))\n        i += 1\n        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # Adding sleep to simulate async behavior\n    return 'saad2'\n\nasync def main():\n    # Use asyncio.gather to run tasks concurrently and collect their results\n    results = await asyncio.gather(\n        func_normal(),\n        func_infinite()\n    )\n    return results\n\n# Get the event loop and run the main coroutine\nloop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\nresults = loop.run_until_complete(main())\nloop.close()\n\n# Print the results\nprint(results)\n```\n\n### Key Changes and Explanation:\n\n1. **Using `async def` and `await`:** \n   - The `@asyncio.coroutine` decorator and `yield from` syntax are replaced with `async def` and `await` for defining and calling asynchronous functions. This syntax is more modern and is recommended for use in Python 3.5+.\n\n2. **`asyncio.gather`:**\n   - This function is used to run multiple coroutines concurrently and collect their results. It returns a list of results, where each element corresponds to the return value of the respective coroutine.\n\n3. **Adding `await asyncio.sleep(0.1)` in `func_infinite`:**\n   - A small sleep is added to `func_infinite` to simulate the asynchronous nature of the task and prevent blocking the event loop.\n\n4. **Use `asyncio.create_task`:**\n   - Although not explicitly shown in the code, `asyncio.create_task` is the recommended way to schedule tasks in Python 3.7+. However, for simple cases like this, `asyncio.gather` is sufficient and handles task creation internally.\n\nBy implementing these changes, you can successfully retrieve and print the returned values from your asynchronous tasks."
