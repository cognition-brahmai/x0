However, when I run the following code:\n\n```python\nimport cv2\na = cv2.imread(r\"DMap.jpg\")\na.shape\ncv2.imwrite('img_CV2_90.jpg', a, [cv2.IMWRITE_JPEG_QUALITY, 90])\n```\n\nI get a SystemError: `error return without exception set`. I've tried using a tuple instead of a list, or adding a trailing 0 to the sequence, but the error persists. Any ideas on how to fix this?"

        "content": "This error can be a bit tricky, but there are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify Image Loading**: Make sure that the image is properly loaded. Check if `a` is `None`, which would indicate that the image was not loaded correctly. You can do this by adding a check right after reading the image:\n\n    ```python\n    import cv2\n    a = cv2.imread(r\"DMap.jpg\")\n    if a is None:\n        print(\"Error loading image\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Image loaded successfully\")\n    ```\n\n2. **Check OpenCV Installation**: Ensure that OpenCV is properly installed. You can try reinstalling it using a trusted package manager like `pip` for Python 2.7:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install opencv-python==2.4.13.6\n    ```\n\n3. **JPEG Support**: Confirm that OpenCV was built with JPEG support. If you're using a pre-built binary, it should have this support. However, if you compiled OpenCV yourself, you might need to ensure that you have the necessary libraries for JPEG enabled.\n\n4. **Try Different Image**: Sometimes the image file itself might be problematic. Try using a different JPEG image to see if the issue is with the specific file you're using.\n\n5. **Alternative Quality Setting**: As a last resort, you might want to try using different image quality settings or formats to see if the error is specific to the quality level:\n\n    ```python\n    cv2.imwrite('img_CV2_80.jpg', a, [cv2.IMWRITE_JPEG_QUALITY, 80])\n    ```\n\n6. **Debugging Information**: If the error persists, provide more debugging information by catching and printing exceptions:\n\n    ```python\n    try:\n        cv2.imwrite('img_CV2_90.jpg', a, [cv2.IMWRITE_JPEG_QUALITY, 90])\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n    ```\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, you might consider upgrading to a newer version of Python and OpenCV, as Python 2.7 and OpenCV 2.4 are outdated and may have compatibility issues."
