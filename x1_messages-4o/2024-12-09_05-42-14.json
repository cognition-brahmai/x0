I understand that `tf.random_normal(shape, mean=0.0, stddev=1.0, dtype=tf.float32, seed=None, name=None)` outputs random values from a normal distribution and `tf.truncated_normal(shape, mean=0.0, stddev=1.0, dtype=tf.float32, seed=None, name=None)` outputs random values from a truncated normal distribution. However, when I tried to look up 'truncated normal distribution', I couldn't understand much. Can someone explain this?"

        "content": "Certainly! Both `tf.random_normal` and `tf.truncated_normal` are used to generate random numbers from a normal distribution, but there are key differences in how they handle the distribution of generated values.\n\n1. **`tf.random_normal`**:\n   - This function generates random numbers that are drawn from a standard normal distribution (also known as a Gaussian distribution). \n   - In a normal distribution, values can theoretically range from negative infinity to positive infinity. Practically, most of the values will lie within three standard deviations of the mean (i.e., 99.7% of the values will fall within this range).\n   - This means you might see some extreme values that are far from the mean, although they are rare.\n\n2. **`tf.truncated_normal`**:\n   - This function also generates random numbers from a normal distribution, but with a truncation applied.\n   - In a truncated normal distribution, values that fall beyond two standard deviations from the mean are discarded and re-sampled. This means that the extreme values are \"cut off\" or truncated.\n   - As a result, the generated numbers will be more tightly clustered around the mean, and you'll never see values that are more than two standard deviations away from the mean.\n   - This can be particularly useful in neural networks, for instance, when initializing weights. Truncated normal initialization helps in preventing large initial weights, which can lead to issues like vanishing or exploding gradients during training.\n\nIn summary, while both functions generate numbers from a normal distribution, `tf.truncated_normal` ensures that the values are not too extreme by truncating the distribution, which can be beneficial in certain applications where stability is a concern."
