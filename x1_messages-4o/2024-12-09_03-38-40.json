I have encountered an issue with nested packages where I am able to import using the unsafe way of importing all in a bulk but unable to do so in a safer way, item by item. Here are the versions of `test.py` I have tried and the results:\n\n1. \n```\n# file test.py\nfrom package.subpackage.module import *\nprint attribute1 # OK\n```\nThis works but it is unsafe.\n\n2. \n```\n# file test.py\nimport package.subpackage.module\nfrom package.subpackage import module # Alternative\nfrom module import attribute1\n```\nThis fails with the message: \"No module named module\".\n\n3. \n```\n# file test.py v3\nfrom package.subpackage.module import attribute1\nprint attribute1 # OK\n```\nThis works but I am either forced to use the overkill prefix all the time or use the unsafe way as in version #1. \n\nI don't want to rely on `sys.path` or `*.pth` files. I tried using imports in `package/subpackage/__init__.py` but it did nothing. Is there any other known way to import subpackages or modules in Python?"

        "content": "In Python, managing imports in a nested package structure can be nuanced, especially when trying to balance safety and convenience. Here are some insights and suggestions to handle your import needs effectively:\n\n1. **Understanding Import Mechanics**:\n   - When you import using `import package.subpackage.module`, you are importing the module as a whole. Accessing specific attributes requires prefixing with the module name (e.g., `module.attribute1`).\n   - The statement `from package.subpackage.module import *` imports all attributes into the current namespace, which is generally discouraged due to potential namespace pollution and conflicts.\n\n2. **Customizing `__init__.py`**:\n   - You can use the `__init__.py` file in your package or subpackage to manage imports and expose specific modules or attributes.\n   - For instance, in `package/subpackage/__init__.py`, you can include:\n     ```python\n     from .module import attribute1\n     ```\n   - This allows you to do:\n     ```python\n     from package.subpackage import attribute1\n     ```\n\n3. **Aliasing for Cleaner Imports**:\n   - Use aliases to make your imports more readable and concise. For example:\n     ```python\n     from package.subpackage.module import attribute1 as attr1\n     print(attr1)  # Cleaner and avoids using the full path\n     ```\n\n4. **Avoiding Global Imports with Specific Imports**:\n   - Stick to importing specific attributes rather than using `*`. This keeps your namespace clean:\n     ```python\n     from package.subpackage.module import attribute1, attribute2\n     ```\n\n5. **Module Level Organization**:\n   - If you frequently need certain attributes, consider reorganizing your modules so that related attributes are grouped logically, thereby minimizing the need to import from deeply nested structures.\n\nBy leveraging `__init__.py` to re-export attributes and using aliases, you can achieve a balance between safety and convenience in your imports. This approach not only keeps your codebase clean but also makes it more maintainable in the long run."
