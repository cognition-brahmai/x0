        "content": "To generate a list of all Sundays (or any specific day of the week) for a given year in Python, you can use the `datetime` module. Below is a sample script that demonstrates how to do this:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import date, timedelta\n\ndef get_weekday_dates(year, weekday):\n    # Create a list to store the dates\n    dates = []\n    \n    # Start from the first day of the year\n    current_date = date(year, 1, 1)\n    \n    # Find the first occurrence of the specified weekday in the year\n    while current_date.weekday() != weekday:\n        current_date += timedelta(days=1)\n    \n    # Collect all the dates with the specified weekday\n    while current_date.year == year:\n        dates.append(current_date.strftime('%m/%d/%Y'))\n        current_date += timedelta(days=7)\n    \n    return dates\n\n# Example usage for Sundays in 2010\nsundays_2010 = get_weekday_dates(2010, 6)  # 6 represents Sunday\nprint(sundays_2010)\n\n# Example usage for Mondays in 2023\nmondays_2023 = get_weekday_dates(2023, 0)  # 0 represents Monday\nprint(mondays_2023)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The `get_weekday_dates` function takes two arguments: `year` and `weekday`.\n- The `weekday` is represented as an integer where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6.\n- The function starts by setting `current_date` to the first day of the specified year.\n- It then finds the first occurrence of the specified weekday by incrementing the date until the desired weekday is found.\n- Once the first occurrence is found, it enters a loop that increments the date by 7 days (one week) each time, collecting all dates for that weekday until it reaches the end of the year.\n- Each date is formatted into the desired string format ('%m/%d/%Y') and added to the list `dates`.\n- The function returns the list `dates`, which contains all the dates of the specified weekday for that year."
