        "content": "To write a function in Python that finds the mode of a list without using any imports, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Count the frequency of each element in the list.\n2. Identify the maximum frequency.\n3. Determine if the maximum frequency is greater than 1, which indicates that there is a mode. If all elements have a frequency of 1, then there's no mode.\n\nHere's a possible implementation of such a function:\n\n```python\ndef find_mode(lst):\n    # Step 1: Count the frequency of each element\n    frequency = {}\n    for item in lst:\n        if item in frequency:\n            frequency[item] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency[item] = 1\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the maximum frequency\n    max_count = max(frequency.values(), default=0)\n\n    # Step 3: Determine if there is a mode\n    if max_count > 1:\n        modes = [key for key, value in frequency.items() if value == max_count]\n        print(f\"The mode(s) of the list is/are: {modes}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The list does not have a mode. All items appear only once.\")\n\n# Example usage:\nfind_mode([1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5])\nfind_mode([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Frequency Counting:** We use a dictionary to count how many times each element appears in the list.\n- **Maximum Frequency:** We find the highest frequency using the `max()` function. The `default=0` is used to handle the case of an empty list.\n- **Check for Mode:** If the maximum frequency is greater than 1, we identify elements with this frequency as modes. Otherwise, we print a message indicating that there's no mode.\n\nThis function will correctly identify the mode(s) of the list or indicate if there isn't one."
