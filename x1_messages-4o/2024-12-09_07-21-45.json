Currently, I am using the following code to delete a bunch of records:\n\n```\nids = []\nwith MongoClient(MONGODB_HOST) as connection:\n    db = connection[MONGODB_NAME]\n    collection = db[MONGODN_COLLECTION]\n    for obj in collection.find({\"date\": {\"$gt\": \"2012-12-15\"}}):\n        ids.append(obj[\"_id\"])\n    for id in ids:\n        print id\n        collection.remove({\"_id\":ObjectId(id)})\n```\n\nI'm wondering if there is a way to delete a whole set of records directly, something like `collection.find({\"date\": {\"$gt\": \"2012-12-15\"}}).delete()` or `collection.find({\"date\": {\"$gt\": \"2012-12-15\"}}).remove()`. Or delete from an object (`obj`) directly, something like `obj.delete()` or `obj.remove()`. Is there any other more elegant solution?"

        "content": "Yes, you can make your code more efficient by using the `delete_many()` method, which allows you to delete multiple documents that match a specified filter efficiently. This eliminates the need to first find the documents and then iterate through their IDs to delete them one by one. Here's how you can refactor your code:\n\n```python\nfrom pymongo import MongoClient\n\nwith MongoClient(MONGODB_HOST) as connection:\n    db = connection[MONGODB_NAME]\n    collection = db[MONGODN_COLLECTION]\n    \n    # Use delete_many to remove all documents matching the filter\n    result = collection.delete_many({\"date\": {\"$gt\": \"2012-12-15\"}})\n    \n    # Output the number of documents deleted\n    print(f\"Deleted {result.deleted_count} documents.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`delete_many()`**: This method allows you to delete all documents that match a given filter. It's much more efficient than deleting each document individually, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n\n2. **`result.deleted_count`**: This attribute gives you the number of documents that were deleted, which can be useful for logging or debugging purposes.\n\nBy using `delete_many()`, you simplify your code and improve its performance, especially when dealing with large numbers of records."
