Here's the code that I am using:\n\n```python\nfrom alembic import op\n\nt = {\"code\": \"123\", \"description\": \"one two three\"}\n\nop.execute(\"insert into field_tags (id, field_id, code, description) \"+\n               \"values (1,'zasz', :code ,:description')\", t)\n```\n\nWhile running this, I'm facing an error stating:\n\n```python\nsqlalchemy.exc.StatementError: A value is required for bind parameter \n  'description' (original cause: InvalidRequestError: A value is required for \n  bind parameter 'description') \"insert into field_tags (id, field_id, code, \n  description) values (1, 'math', \n  %(code)s ,%(description)s)\" []\n```\n\nI'm not sure what's going wrong here and how to fix it. Any suggestions?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to a small syntax issue in your SQL statement. Specifically, there's an extra single quote at the end of the `:description` placeholder, turning it into `:description'`. This causes SQLAlchemy to not properly recognize the placeholder, leading to the error you see about the missing bind parameter.\n\nHere's the corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nfrom alembic import op\n\nt = {\"code\": \"123\", \"description\": \"one two three\"}\n\nop.execute(\n    \"INSERT INTO field_tags (id, field_id, code, description) \"\n    \"VALUES (1, 'zasz', :code, :description)\",\n    t\n)\n```\n\nBy removing the extra single quote from `:description'`, your placeholders should now be correctly recognized, allowing SQLAlchemy to bind the parameters properly.\n\nAdditionally, ensure the table `field_tags` and columns `id`, `field_id`, `code`, and `description` all exist in your database schema as expected. If the error persists, it could be helpful to check your database schema and ensure that the table and column names match exactly, and that there are no constraints or issues with the values being inserted (such as data type mismatches)."
