Is there any method to avoid these NaN values without setting them explicitly to 0? Here's the code:\n\n```python\nframe = pd.DataFrame({'a': [1, 2, np.nan], 'b': [3, np.nan, 4]})\nframe['c'] = frame['a'] + frame['b']\nframe\n```\nThis outputs:\n\n```\n    a   b   c\n0   1   3   4\n1   2 NaN NaN\n2 NaN   4 NaN\n```\nHowever, I would like column 'c' to be [4, 2, 4]. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired result without explicitly setting NaN values to 0, you can use the `sum` method with the `min_count` parameter. This method allows you to specify the minimum number of non-NA values required to perform the operation. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\nframe = pd.DataFrame({'a': [1, 2, np.nan], 'b': [3, np.nan, 4]})\nframe['c'] = frame[['a', 'b']].sum(axis=1, min_count=1)\nframe\n```\n\nBy setting `min_count=1`, the sum will ignore NaN values as long as there is at least one non-NaN value in the row. This will give you the desired output:\n\n```\n     a    b    c\n0  1.0  3.0  4.0\n1  2.0  NaN  2.0\n2  NaN  4.0  4.0\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that the sum is computed even if one of the columns contains NaN, as long as there is at least one present value."
