        "content": "I'm attempting to read a very large csv file using pandas dataframe's read_csv method. The file is too large to be opened and edited in Excel. Around the 100,000th row of the CSV, there is a row with an extra column which crashes the program. I need a way to ignore the row with the extra column. Since there are around 50 columns, hardcoding the headers using 'names' or 'usecols' is not my preferred solution. I may encounter this issue with other CSV files as well, so I am looking for a generic solution. I haven't found anything in read_csv that could help me. My current code is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef loadCSV(filePath):\n    dataframe = pd.read_csv(filePath, index_col=False, encoding='iso-8859-1', nrows=1000)\n    datakeys = dataframe.keys();\n    return dataframe, datakeys\n```"

        "content": "To handle CSV files where some rows might have an incorrect number of columns, you can use the `error_bad_lines` parameter in the `read_csv` function. This parameter allows you to skip lines with too many fields. However, please note that `error_bad_lines` is deprecated in newer versions of pandas, and you should use `on_bad_lines` instead.\n\nHere's how you can modify your function to handle this issue:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef loadCSV(filePath):\n    # Use the 'on_bad_lines' parameter to skip bad lines\n    dataframe = pd.read_csv(\n        filePath,\n        index_col=False,\n        encoding='iso-8859-1',\n        nrows=1000,\n        on_bad_lines='skip'\n    )\n    datakeys = dataframe.keys()\n    return dataframe, datakeys\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the changes:\n\n- The parameter `on_bad_lines='skip'` tells pandas to skip rows with a different number of columns than expected. This is useful for skipping rows that might cause issues due to having extra fields.\n\nThis approach will allow you to read the CSV file without crashing when encountering problematic rows. Note that the skipped rows will not be present in the loaded DataFrame, so if retaining those rows in some form is important, you'll need to handle them separately."
