        "content": "To display line numbers by default in IPython Notebook (now known as Jupyter Notebook) code cells, you can modify the `custom.js` file to automatically enable line numbers when a notebook is loaded. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Locate the Custom Directory**:\n   - First, you need to find the Jupyter configuration directory. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\n     ```bash\n     jupyter --config-dir\n     ```\n   - This will output the path to the configuration directory, usually something like `~/.jupyter`.\n\n2. **Create or Modify custom.js**:\n   - Navigate to the `custom` subdirectory within the Jupyter configuration directory. If it doesn't exist, create it:\n     ```bash\n     mkdir -p ~/.jupyter/custom\n     ```\n   - Inside the `custom` directory, create or edit the `custom.js` file:\n     ```bash\n     nano ~/.jupyter/custom/custom.js\n     ```\n\n3. **Add JavaScript to Enable Line Numbers**:\n   - Add the following JavaScript code to the `custom.js` file:\n     ```javascript\n     // Enable line numbers by default in code cells\n     require([\n       'base/js/namespace',\n       'base/js/events'\n     ], function(Jupyter, events) {\n       events.on('notebook_loaded.Notebook', function() {\n         Jupyter.notebook.get_cells().forEach(function(cell) {\n           if (cell.cell_type === 'code') {\n             cell.code_mirror.setOption('lineNumbers', true);\n           }\n         });\n       });\n     });\n     ```\n\n4. **Save and Close**:\n   - Save the changes to `custom.js` and close the editor. If you used `nano`, you can save by pressing `CTRL + O`, then `Enter`, and close by pressing `CTRL + X`.\n\n5. **Restart Jupyter Notebook**:\n   - Restart your Jupyter Notebook server. Now, when you open any notebook, line numbers should be enabled by default for all code cells.\n\nThis approach uses JavaScript to modify the behavior of the notebook interface, ensuring line numbers are displayed by default without needing to manually enable them each time."
