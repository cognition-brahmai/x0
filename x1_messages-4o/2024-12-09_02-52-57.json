When I interrupt the process, I receive a KeyboardInterrupt error. I have tried installing with `--no-wheel` as suggested in a similar issue, but without success. I am sure it is not a network connectivity problem because setting up an environment using python2 with `virtualenv env` gives no errors. The versions of the packages I am using are python 3.4.0, python 2.7.6, and virtualenv 15.1.0. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "This issue could be caused by several factors, including compatibility issues with Python 3.4.0 or problems with the version of `setuptools`, `pip`, or `wheel` being installed. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Upgrade Python**: Python 3.4.0 is quite old and might have compatibility issues. Consider upgrading to a more recent version of Python 3, such as Python 3.6, 3.7, or later. This might resolve the problem since newer Python versions usually come with updated `pip` and `setuptools`.\n\n2. **Upgrade Virtualenv**: The version of `virtualenv` you are using (15.1.0) is also quite old. Upgrade to the latest version of `virtualenv` to ensure compatibility with newer Python versions. You can upgrade `virtualenv` using:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade virtualenv\n   ```\n\n3. **Manually Install Setuptools, Pip, and Wheel**: Before creating the virtual environment, manually install the latest versions of `setuptools`, `pip`, and `wheel` in your Python 3.4 environment:\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m pip install --upgrade setuptools pip wheel\n   ```\n\n4. **Check System Path**: Ensure that the Python 3 executable is correctly referenced in your system's PATH variable. You can check which Python version is being used by running:\n   ```bash\n   which python3\n   ```\n\n5. **Use Virtualenv with Python Path**: Explicitly specify the path to your Python 3 executable when creating the virtual environment:\n   ```bash\n   virtualenv -p /path/to/python3 venv\n   ```\n   Replace `/path/to/python3` with the actual path to your Python 3 executable.\n\n6. **Check Log Files**: If the process still hangs, check for any log files or error messages that might provide more information about what's causing the issue.\n\n7. **Alternative Tools**: Consider using `venv`, which is the built-in module for creating virtual environments in Python 3.3 and later. You can create a virtual environment using `venv` like this:\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m venv venv\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully create a virtual environment using Python 3."
