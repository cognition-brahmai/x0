        "content": "Why doesn't Python's mmap work with large files? I am creating a module that allows bitwise read access to files. The files can be quite large (in hundreds of GB) so I wrote a simple class that treats the file like a string and hides all the seeking and reading. I have recently discovered the mmap module and thought it would be a great replacement. However, I found out that mmap doesn't work for large files. If the file is more than a few gigabytes, I get an EnvironmentError: [Errno 12] Cannot allocate memory. This seems to only occur with a 32-bit Python build, suggesting it is running out of address space. Is there a way to use mmap portably on large files or should I revert back to my file wrapper? Here's the code I'm using:\n```python\nf = open('somelargefile', 'rb')\nmap = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0, access=mmap.ACCESS_READ)\n```\nI also created a simple class that has some functionality of mmap and it works without any restrictions on file size. Can this be used as a workaround?\n```python\nimport os\n\nclass Mmap(object):\n    def __init__(self, f):\n        \"\"\"Initialise with a file object.\"\"\"\n        self.source = f\n\n    def __getitem__(self, key):\n        try:\n            # A slice\n            self.source.seek(key.start, os.SEEK_SET)\n            return self.source.read(key.stop - key.start)\n        except AttributeError:\n            # single element\n            self.source.seek(key, os.SEEK_SET)\n            return self.source.read(1)\n            \nmap2 = Mmap(f)\nprint map2[0:10]\nprint map2[10000000000:10000000010]\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're facing with `mmap` on large files is indeed related to the limitations of addressable memory space, especially on a 32-bit build of Python. Here's a breakdown of the problem and possible solutions:\n\n### Problem Analysis\n\n1. **32-bit Limitation**: A 32-bit system can only address up to 4 GB of memory space. This includes all memory used by the operating system, your application, and any mapped files. Therefore, trying to mmap a file larger than this limit will result in an inability to allocate the necessary address space.\n\n2. **Memory Mapping**: When you use `mmap`, the entire file is mapped into the memory space of your application. On a 64-bit system, this is much less of an issue since the addressable space is vastly larger, but on 32-bit, this is a limiting factor.\n\n### Solutions\n\n1. **Use a 64-bit Python Build**: If possible, switch to a 64-bit version of Python on a 64-bit OS. This will allow you to map much larger files without running into address space limitations.\n\n2. **Manual File Access**: Since you've already implemented a workaround using the `Mmap` class, this is a valid and scalable approach. Your class manually seeks and reads the file without mapping the entire file into memory, which works well for large files regardless of system architecture.\n\n3. **Partial Mapping**: Instead of mapping the entire file, you can map smaller chunks of the file at a time. This approach requires managing the offset and size of each mapped chunk but allows you to work within the limitations of a 32-bit address space.\n\nHere's an example of how you might implement partial mapping:\n\n```python\nimport mmap\nimport os\n\nclass PartialMmap:\n    def __init__(self, file_path, chunk_size):\n        self.file_path = file_path\n        self.chunk_size = chunk_size\n        self.file_size = os.path.getsize(file_path)\n        self.file = open(file_path, 'rb')\n        self.current_offset = 0\n        self.map = None\n        self._map_chunk(0)\n\n    def _map_chunk(self, offset):\n        if self.map:\n            self.map.close()\n        self.current_offset = offset\n        self.map = mmap.mmap(self.file.fileno(), self.chunk_size, access=mmap.ACCESS_READ, offset=offset)\n\n    def __getitem__(self, key):\n        if isinstance(key, slice):\n            start, stop, _ = key.indices(self.file_size)\n            if stop > self.file_size:\n                raise IndexError(\"Slice exceeds file size\")\n            if start < self.current_offset or stop > self.current_offset + self.chunk_size:\n                self._map_chunk(start)\n            relative_start = start - self.current_offset\n            relative_stop = stop - self.current_offset\n            return self.map[relative_start:relative_stop]\n        else:\n            if key >= self.file_size:\n                raise IndexError(\"Index out of range\")\n            if key < self.current_offset or key >= self.current_offset + self.chunk_size:\n                self._map_chunk(key)\n            return self.map[key - self.current_offset]\n\n# Usage\nfile_path = 'somelargefile'\nchunk_size = 1024 * 1024 * 100  # 100 MB\npartial_map = PartialMmap(file_path, chunk_size)\nprint(partial_map[0:10])\nprint(partial_map[10000000000:10000000010])\n```\n\nThis code maps only a portion of the file into memory, making it suitable even for large files and on systems with limited addressable space. Adjust the `chunk_size` based on your memory availability and access patterns."
