        "content": "To write a Python program that finds the sum of all divisors of a specific integer, you can use the following approach. The idea is to iterate through all numbers from 1 to the integer itself and check if a number is a divisor. If it is, add it to the sum. Here\u2019s a simple implementation:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors(n):\n    # Initialize sum\n    total = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over all numbers from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Check if i is a divisor of n\n        if n % i == 0:\n            total += i\n            \n    return total\n\n# Example usage\nnumber = int(input(\"Enter an integer: \"))\nresult = sum_of_divisors(number)\nprint(f\"The sum of all divisors of {number} is: {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**: We define a function `sum_of_divisors` that takes an integer `n`.\n2. **Initialize `total`**: A variable `total` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the sum of the divisors.\n3. **Loop**: We loop through each integer `i` from 1 to `n`.\n4. **Check Divisibility**: For each `i`, we check if `n` is divisible by `i` using the modulus operator `%`.\n5. **Add to Total**: If `i` is a divisor (i.e., `n % i == 0`), we add it to `total`.\n6. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the total sum of divisors.\n\nThis program will correctly calculate the sum of all divisors for a given integer."
