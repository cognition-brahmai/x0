However, when I try to import from the keras module, I encounter an ImportError: libcublas.so.9.0, saying it cannot open the shared object file. The error log also mentions a failure to load the native tensorflow runtime. The error details are as follows:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/pywrap_tensorflow.py\", line 58, in <module>\nfrom tensorflow.python.pywrap_tensorflow_internal import *\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-\npackages/tensorflow/python/pywrap_tensorflow_internal.py\", line 28, in <module>\n_pywrap_tensorflow_internal = swig_import_helper()\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/pywrap_tensorflow_internal.py\", line 24, in swig_import_helper\n_mod = imp.load_module('_pywrap_tensorflow_internal', fp, pathname, description)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python3.5/imp.py\", line 242, in load_module\nreturn load_dynamic(name, filename, file)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python3.5/imp.py\", line 342, in load_dynamic\nreturn _load(spec)\n\nImportError: libcublas.so.9.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n```\n\nWhen I run `nvcc --version`, the cuda version returned is, `Cuda compilation tools, release 8.0, V8.0.61`. I suspect this issue might be due to a clash between the two cuda versions. Could anyone guide on how to resolve this issue?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The issue you're encountering is indeed likely due to a mismatch between the CUDA version your TensorFlow installation expects and the version currently active on your system. TensorFlow requires a specific version of CUDA and cuDNN, and it seems like your TensorFlow installation is expecting CUDA 9.0, but your system defaults to CUDA 8.0.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step guide to resolving the issue:\n\n1. **Verify TensorFlow Version Requirements:**\n   Make sure you know which version of CUDA is required by your version of TensorFlow. You can find this information in the TensorFlow release notes or documentation.\n\n2. **Set the Correct CUDA Version:**\n   If TensorFlow expects CUDA 9.0, you need to ensure that your environment is set up to use it. You can do this by modifying the `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point to CUDA 9.0.\n\n   - Open your terminal and run the following commands to set your CUDA environment to version 9.0:\n\n     ```bash\n     export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-9.0/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}\n     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-9.0/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}\n     ```\n\n3. **Check Your CUDA and cuDNN Installations:**\n   Ensure that both CUDA 9.0 and its corresponding version of cuDNN are correctly installed. You can check the files in `/usr/local/cuda-9.0/lib64` to make sure `libcublas.so.9.0` exists.\n\n4. **Update the Default CUDA Version:**\n   If you want to make CUDA 9.0 the default version, you might consider updating the symbolic links:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo rm /usr/local/cuda\n   sudo ln -s /usr/local/cuda-9.0 /usr/local/cuda\n   ```\n\n5. **Restart Your System:**\n   After making changes to environment variables or symbolic links, a restart can help ensure that all applications use the updated paths.\n\n6. **Reinstall TensorFlow:**\n   If the above steps don't work, consider reinstalling TensorFlow to ensure it correctly links against the CUDA version you have set up. Use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n   pip install tensorflow-gpu==<your_version>\n   ```\n\n7. **Verify the Installation:**\n   Run a simple TensorFlow script to check if the GPU is detected:\n\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n   print(\"Num GPUs Available: \", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))\n   ```\n\nImplement these steps, and you should resolve the ImportError related to `libcublas.so.9.0`. If issues persist, double-check the compatibility of all components (CUDA, cuDNN, TensorFlow, and your GPU drivers)."
