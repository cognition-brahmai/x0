First, perform the multiplication:  \n   \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\)\n\n2. Then, perform the division:  \n   \\(\\frac{7}{3} \\approx 2.333\\)\n\n3. Now substitute back into the expression:  \n   \\(20 - 10 + 2.333\\)\n\n4. Perform the subtraction:  \n   \\(20 - 10 = 10\\)\n\n5. Finally, perform the addition:  \n   \\(10 + 2.333 = 12.333\\)\n\nSo, \\(20 - 5 \\times 2 + \\frac{7}{3} \\approx 12.333\\)."
