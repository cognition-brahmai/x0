However, I'm looking to expand its functionality in two ways. First, I would like to be able to request other parameters like city name, instead of just the city id. When I tried using `api.add_resource(CityAPI, '/api/city/&lt;string:name&gt;', endpoint='city')`, it throws an AssertionError: \"View function mapping is overwriting an existing endpoint function\". Second, I want to combine the two Resources in a Request - for instance, get all the users associated with a certain city. Ideally, the REST URL should look like `/api/cities/&lt;int:id&gt;/users`. How can I achieve this in Flask and map it to the correct endpoint?"

        "content": "To expand your Flask-RESTful API functionality to handle additional query parameters and combine resources, you'll need to make a few adjustments to your routing and resource design. Here\u2019s how you can achieve both requirements:\n\n### 1. Requesting Other Parameters like City Name\n\nThe error you're encountering is because Flask doesn't allow duplicate endpoint names. You should ensure that each route has a unique endpoint name. Additionally, you can handle multiple types of queries (e.g., by city ID or name) by defining different routes or by using query parameters.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can set it up:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request\nfrom flask_restful import Api, Resource\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napi = Api(app)\n\nclass CityAPI(Resource):\n    def get(self, city_id=None):\n        if city_id is not None:\n            # Handle getting city by ID\n            return {\"city_id\": city_id}\n\n        # Handle getting city by name from query string\n        city_name = request.args.get('name')\n        if city_name:\n            return {\"city_name\": city_name}\n\n        return {\"message\": \"City not found\"}, 404\n\napi.add_resource(CityAPI, '/api/city/<int:city_id>', endpoint='city_id')\napi.add_resource(CityAPI, '/api/city', endpoint='city_name')  # Use query string for name\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n### 2. Combining Resources: Getting Users Associated with a City\n\nTo map a URL to get all users associated with a certain city, you can define a nested route. This involves creating a new resource or extending an existing one to handle the nested relationship.\n\nHere\u2019s an example implementation:\n\n```python\nclass UsersByCityAPI(Resource):\n    def get(self, city_id):\n        # Logic to fetch users associated with a city by city_id\n        users = [{\"user_id\": 1, \"name\": \"John Doe\"}]  # Example response\n        return {\"city_id\": city_id, \"users\": users}\n\napi.add_resource(UsersByCityAPI, '/api/cities/<int:city_id>/users', endpoint='users_by_city')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Unique Endpoints**: Ensure each route has a distinct endpoint name to avoid conflicts.\n- **Query Parameters**: Use query parameters to handle different types of queries like searching by name.\n- **Nested Routes**: For combined resources, define routes that reflect the hierarchical relationship, such as `/api/cities/<int:city_id>/users`.\n\nBy structuring your routes and resources this way, you can effectively handle more complex queries and relationships within your Flask-RESTful API."
