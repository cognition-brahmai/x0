In my code, I am trying to filter out English stopwords from the negative features of movie reviews. However, when I pass my 'negfeats' dictionary into the 'stopword_filtered_word_feats' function, I receive this error. Could you explain why this is happening and how to solve it? Here is the code I'm working with:\n\n```python\nnegids = movie_reviews.fileids('neg')\n\ndef word_feats(words):\n    return dict([(word, True) for word in words])\n\nnegfeats = [(word_feats(movie_reviews.words(fileids=[f])), 'neg') for f in negids]\nstopset = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n\ndef stopword_filtered_word_feats(words):\n    return dict([(word, True) for word in words if word not in stopset])\n\nresult = stopword_filtered_word_feats(negfeats)\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, `TypeError: unhashable type: 'dict'`, is occurring because you're trying to pass a list of tuples (where each tuple contains a dictionary and a string) into the `stopword_filtered_word_feats` function, which expects a list of words. \n\nIn your code, `negfeats` is a list of tuples, where each tuple is in the form `(word_feats_dict, 'neg')`. The function `stopword_filtered_word_feats` is designed to take a list of words, not a list of tuples or dictionaries.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Extract Words from `negfeats`:** You need to extract the words from the dictionary in each tuple of `negfeats`.\n\n2. **Apply Stopword Filtering:** Apply the `stopword_filtered_word_feats` function to these words.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom nltk.corpus import movie_reviews\n\nnegids = movie_reviews.fileids('neg')\n\ndef word_feats(words):\n    return dict([(word, True) for word in words])\n\nnegfeats = [(word_feats(movie_reviews.words(fileids=[f])), 'neg') for f in negids]\nstopset = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n\ndef stopword_filtered_word_feats(words):\n    return dict([(word, True) for word in words if word not in stopset])\n\n# Applying the stopword filter to the words in negfeats\nfiltered_negfeats = [(stopword_filtered_word_feats(list(feat.keys())), category) for feat, category in negfeats]\n\n# Result now contains the filtered features\nresult = filtered_negfeats\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Extracting Words:** In the line `list(feat.keys())`, `feat` is a dictionary with words as keys, and we're extracting these keys to get the list of words for each review.\n- **Applying the Function:** We then apply `stopword_filtered_word_feats` to this list of words to filter out the stopwords.\n- **Reconstructing Tuples:** We reconstruct the tuple with the filtered features and the category label (`'neg'`).\n\nThis should resolve the `TypeError` and allow you to filter out stopwords from your movie review negative features."
