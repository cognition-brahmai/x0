However, it seems that synaptic only installed PyQt4 for python 2 as I've only found related files and folders under python 2.6 and 2.7. Also, when I try to import PyQt4 in Python 3.2, I get an ImportError: No module named PyQt4, but there's no error when running the same code in Python 2.7. How can I make PyQt4 to function with Python 3 and Eclipse?"

        "content": "To configure PyQt4 for Python 3 on Ubuntu, you'll need to build and install it manually since PyQt4 is not officially available for Python 3 in many package managers. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Step 1: Install Required Dependencies\n\nFirst, you need to install some necessary development tools and libraries:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install qt4-dev-tools qt4-qmake libqt4-dev python3-dev build-essential\n```\n\n### Step 2: Download SIP\n\nSIP is a tool that you need to build PyQt4. You can download it from the official website:\n\n1. Go to [Riverbank Computing SIP](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/sip/download).\n2. Download the latest version of SIP source package.\n\n### Step 3: Build and Install SIP\n\nNavigate to the directory where you downloaded SIP and extract it:\n\n```bash\ntar -xvf sip-<version>.tar.gz\ncd sip-<version>\n```\n\nThen, build and install SIP for Python 3:\n\n```bash\npython3 configure.py\nmake\nsudo make install\n```\n\n### Step 4: Download PyQt4\n\nNext, download the PyQt4 source code from the Riverbank Computing website:\n\n1. Go to [Riverbank Computing PyQt4](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download).\n2. Download the latest version of PyQt4 source package.\n\n### Step 5: Build and Install PyQt4\n\nExtract the PyQt4 source package and navigate into it:\n\n```bash\ntar -xvf PyQt4_gpl_x.xx.tar.gz\ncd PyQt4_gpl_x.xx\n```\n\nConfigure, build, and install PyQt4 using Python 3:\n\n```bash\npython3 configure.py\nmake\nsudo make install\n```\n\n### Step 6: Verify Installation\n\nOpen a Python 3 shell and try importing PyQt4 to check if the installation was successful:\n\n```python\nimport PyQt4\n```\n\nIf you don't get any errors, PyQt4 is installed correctly for Python 3.\n\n### Step 7: Configuring Eclipse\n\nTo configure Eclipse to use PyQt4 with Python 3:\n\n1. Open Eclipse and go to `Window` > `Preferences`.\n2. Navigate to `PyDev` > `Interpreter - Python`.\n3. Add your Python 3 interpreter if it's not already listed.\n4. Ensure that the PyQt4 library paths are included in the system PYTHONPATH. This can be set under `Libraries` when you configure the interpreter.\n\n### Notes:\n\n- PyQt4 is relatively older, and you might want to consider using PyQt5 or PyQt6, which have better support and are more future-proof.\n- Make sure you have the correct version numbers when downloading SIP and PyQt4.\n- Building from source can sometimes be tricky due to dependencies and environment-specific issues, so ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.\n\nThis setup should enable you to use PyQt4 with Python 3 in Eclipse on Ubuntu."
