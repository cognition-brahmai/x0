Specifically, I want the first dataframe to contain the first 10 rows and the remaining rows should be in the second dataframe. Is there a convenient function to accomplish this, such as a hypothetical function `split_dataframe(df, 2(if > 10))`?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this by using Pandas, a powerful data manipulation library in Python. Here's a convenient function that will split your dataframe into two if it has more than 10 rows: \n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef split_dataframe(df):\n    # Check if the dataframe has more than 10 rows\n    if len(df) > 10:\n        # Split the dataframe into two\n        df1 = df.iloc[:10]  # First 10 rows\n        df2 = df.iloc[10:]  # Remaining rows\n        return df1, df2\n    else:\n        # If the dataframe has 10 or fewer rows, return it as is\n        return df, None\n\n# Example usage\n# Assuming you have a dataframe 'df'\ndf1, df2 = split_dataframe(df)\n\nif df2 is not None:\n    print(\"Dataframe was split into two:\")\n    print(\"First dataframe (first 10 rows):\")\n    print(df1)\n    print(\"\\nSecond dataframe (remaining rows):\")\n    print(df2)\nelse:\n    print(\"Dataframe has 10 or fewer rows, not split:\")\n    print(df1)\n```\n\nThis function checks if the dataframe has more than 10 rows, and if so, it splits it into two dataframes: the first containing the first 10 rows and the second containing the remaining rows. If the dataframe has 10 or fewer rows, it simply returns the original dataframe and `None` for the second dataframe. You can then handle these dataframes as needed."
