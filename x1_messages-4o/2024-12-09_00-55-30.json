        "content": "In Python, you can implement the ternary conditional operator using a concise syntax known as the conditional expression or ternary operator. The general syntax is:\n\n```python\nvalue_if_true if condition else value_if_false\n```\n\nFor your specific case, where you want to evaluate whether `value` is `'ok'` and return `'ok'` if true, and `'not ok'` if false, you can write it as follows:\n\n```python\nresult = 'ok' if value == 'ok' else 'not ok'\n```\n\nThis line of code will assign `'ok'` to `result` if `value` is equal to `'ok'`, and `'not ok'` otherwise. This is a more Pythonic way to perform conditional assignments compared to using traditional if-else statements."
