Your goal is to come up with a dish that is both unique and flavorful, and that will stand out among the restaurant's other offerings.\nTo start, you must select the perfect avocados. You need to find avocados that are ripe enough to be mashed, but not too ripe that they become too mushy. You can identify ripe avocados by gently pressing on them - if they give slightly, they are ready to use.\nNext, you need to prepare the tomatoes and onions. You want to finely dice them, but also make sure they are evenly distributed throughout the dish. To achieve this, try using a food processor or a mandoline to ensure consistent size.\nNow it's time to add some flavor to the mix. You can choose to add different types of peppers, herbs, and spices depending on your taste preferences. However, there's a catch - you can only choose three ingredients from a list of 10:\n1. Jalapeno pepper\n2. Cayenne pepper\n3. Black pepper\n4. Cumin\n5. Paprika\n6. Garlic\n7. Basil\n8. Cilantro\n9. Rosemary\n10. Thyme\nChoose wisely, as the three ingredients you choose will make or break the dish.\nFinally, it's time to serve the dish. You have three options:\n1. Serve it as a side dish alongside grilled meats or vegetables.\n2. Incorporate it into a variety of Mexican-inspired dishes.\n3. Use it as a topping for homemade tortilla chips.\nYour goal is to create a dish that will impress the restaurant's customers and receive rave reviews. Good luck!"
