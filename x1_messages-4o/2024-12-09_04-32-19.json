Python doesn't throw any error, which makes it hard for me to debug the issue. Here is my code:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport os, sys\n\npath = ('C:\\Users\\Maxxie\\color\\complete')\n\ndef resize():\n    for item in os.listdir(path):\n        if os.path.isfile(item):\n            im = Image.open(item)\n            f, e = os.path.splitext(item)\n            imResize = im.resize((200,200), Image.ANTIALIAS)\n            imResize.save(f + ' resized.jpg', 'JPEG', quality=90)\n\nresize()\n```\nCould someone advise on why this is not working?"

        "content": "I can help you troubleshoot the issue with your code. There are a few potential problems that could be causing it to not work as expected. Let's go through them:\n\n1. **File Path Issue**: The `path` variable uses a backslash (`\\`), which is a special character in Python strings (used for things like `\\n` for newline). To avoid this, use a raw string or double backslashes:\n\n   ```python\n   path = r'C:\\Users\\Maxxie\\color\\complete'\n   ```\n\n   or\n\n   ```python\n   path = 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Maxxie\\\\color\\\\complete'\n   ```\n\n2. **File Path in `os.path.isfile`**: When you use `os.path.isfile(item)`, it checks if `item` is a file in the current working directory, not in the `path` directory. You need to combine `path` and `item` to get the full path of the file:\n\n   ```python\n   if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(path, item)):\n   ```\n\n3. **Opening Images**: When opening the image, you should also use the full path:\n\n   ```python\n   im = Image.open(os.path.join(path, item))\n   ```\n\n4. **Saving Images**: Ensure that the resized images are saved to a specific directory or use an absolute path to avoid confusion:\n\n   ```python\n   imResize.save(os.path.join(path, f + ' resized.jpg'), 'JPEG', quality=90)\n   ```\n\n5. **Check for Image Files Only**: It is also a good idea to check the file extension to make sure you are trying to open image files only.\n\nHere's the corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport os\n\npath = r'C:\\Users\\Maxxie\\color\\complete'\n\ndef resize():\n    for item in os.listdir(path):\n        full_path = os.path.join(path, item)\n        if os.path.isfile(full_path):\n            try:\n                im = Image.open(full_path)\n                f, e = os.path.splitext(item)\n                imResize = im.resize((200, 200), Image.ANTIALIAS)\n                imResize.save(os.path.join(path, f + ' resized.jpg'), 'JPEG', quality=90)\n            except Exception as e:\n                print(f\"Could not process {item}: {e}\")\n\nresize()\n```\n\nAdditionally, if you still encounter issues, try adding some print statements to debug and ensure that the script is iterating over the files correctly."
