Here's how you can do it:\n\n```bash\ngrep -Rl \"curl\" ./ | wc -l\n```\n\nThis command will search recursively (`-R`) for the keyword \"curl\" and list the filenames (`-l`). The output is then piped to `wc -l`, which will count the number of lines, effectively giving you the number of files containing the keyword \"curl\"."
