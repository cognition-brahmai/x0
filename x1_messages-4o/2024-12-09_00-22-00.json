However, when I execute a query to delete a user, I'm encountering an error indicating that the address row is still referenced. How can I delete both the user and the associated addresses without generating an error? \n\nHere is my current code:\n\n```python\nclass User(db.Model):\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n    addresses = db.relationship('Address', cascade='all,delete', backref='user')\n\nclass Address(db.Model):\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n    user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey(User.id))\n```\n\nI am attempting to delete a user with an id of 1:\n```python\ndb.session.query(User).filter(User.my_id==1).delete()\n```\n\nBut I'm getting an `IntegrityError` as follows:\n```python\nIntegrityError: (IntegrityError) update or delete on table \"user\" violates foreign key constraint \"addresses_user_id_fkey\" on table \"address\"\nDETAIL:  Key (my_id)=(1) is still referenced from table \"address\".\n 'DELETE FROM \"user\" WHERE \"user\".id = %(id_1)s' {'id_1': 1}\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the `delete()` method in SQLAlchemy performs a bulk deletion operation, which bypasses the ORM's cascade functionality. This means that the associated `Address` records are not being automatically deleted, hence the foreign key constraint error.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you should delete the user using the ORM's session `delete()` method, which respects cascading rules defined in the relationship. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Fetch the user object from the database\nuser_to_delete = db.session.query(User).filter_by(id=1).first()\n\n# Delete the user using the session's delete method\nif user_to_delete:\n    db.session.delete(user_to_delete)\n    db.session.commit()\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that any related `Address` objects are also deleted because the ORM's cascading rules are applied when using `session.delete()`. By explicitly fetching the `User` object first, you allow SQLAlchemy to handle the cascading deletion of related objects properly.\n\nEnsure that your `cascade` option in the relationship is correctly set as you did with `cascade='all,delete'`, which will take care of deleting all related addresses when a user is deleted."
