I have a 3x3 numpy array defined as:\n```python\na = numpy.arange(0,27,3).reshape(3,3)\n# array([[ 0,  3,  6],\n#        [ 9, 12, 15],\n#        [18, 21, 24]])\n```\nTo normalize the rows of the 2-dimensional array, I am currently using the following code:\n```python\nrow_sums = a.sum(axis=1) # array([ 9, 36, 63])\nnew_matrix = numpy.zeros((3,3))\nfor i, (row, row_sum) in enumerate(zip(a, row_sums)):\n    new_matrix[i,:] = row / row_sum\n```\nI am looking for a better and less verbose approach. By normalization, I mean that the sum of the entries per row must be one."

        "content": "You can achieve row-wise normalization of a 2-dimensional numpy array in a much more concise way by using broadcasting. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.arange(0, 27, 3).reshape(3, 3)\n# array([[ 0,  3,  6],\n#        [ 9, 12, 15],\n#        [18, 21, 24]])\n\n# Calculate the sum of each row\nrow_sums = a.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True)\n\n# Normalize each row by dividing by the row sum\nnormalized_a = a / row_sums\n\nprint(normalized_a)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `row_sums = a.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True)` calculates the sum of each row and keeps the dimensions intact, which is necessary for broadcasting. This results in a column vector.\n- `a / row_sums` uses broadcasting to divide each element in a row by the corresponding row sum.\n\nThis approach is more concise and efficient, leveraging numpy's broadcasting feature to perform the normalization without the need for explicit loops."
