        "content": "To find the nth prime number greater than 1000 and excluding those divisible by 3 in PHP, you can implement a function that checks each number for primality and whether it is divisible by 3. Here's a code snippet to achieve this:\n\n```php\n<?php\n\nfunction isPrime($num) {\n    if ($num <= 1) return false;\n    if ($num == 2) return true;\n    if ($num % 2 == 0) return false;\n\n    $sqrtNum = sqrt($num);\n    for ($i = 3; $i <= $sqrtNum; $i += 2) {\n        if ($num % $i == 0) return false;\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n\nfunction nthPrimeExcludingDivBy3($n) {\n    $count = 0;\n    $num = 1001; // Start checking from the first odd number greater than 1000\n\n    while ($count < $n) {\n        if (isPrime($num) && $num % 3 !== 0) {\n            $count++;\n            if ($count === $n) {\n                return $num;\n            }\n        }\n        $num += 2; // Skip even numbers\n    }\n}\n\n$n = 10; // Example: Find the 10th prime number greater than 1000, excluding those divisible by 3\necho \"The {$n}th prime number greater than 1000, excluding those divisible by 3, is: \" . nthPrimeExcludingDivBy3($n);\n\n?>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **isPrime Function**: This function checks if a number is prime. It skips even numbers and checks divisibility up to the square root of the number for efficiency.\n2. **nthPrimeExcludingDivBy3 Function**: This function iterates over odd numbers starting from 1001, checking if each number is both prime and not divisible by 3. It increments a counter each time it finds such a prime and stops when the nth prime is found.\n\nThis code will output the nth prime number greater than 1000 that is not divisible by 3. You can adjust the value of `$n` to find different nth primes."
