        "content": "Your current approach using `zip` is quite idiomatic for iterating over pairs of current and next elements in Python. However, if you're looking for a more general solution that can handle N elements at a time, you might want to consider using the `itertools` module, which provides a handy function called `islice`. Another powerful tool for this task is the `windowed` function from the `more_itertools` library.\n\nHere's how you can use `itertools.islice` to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import islice\n\ndef windowed(iterable, n):\n    iterators = [islice(iterable, i, None) for i in range(n)]\n    return zip(*iterators)\n\nthe_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nfor window in windowed(the_list, 2):  # Change 2 to N for N elements at a time\n    print(window)\n```\n\nIn this example, `windowed` is a function that generates a sliding window of `n` elements from the `iterable`. It creates `n` iterators, each starting from a different position in the list, and then zips them together.\n\nIf you prefer using the `more_itertools` library, which provides a `windowed` function out of the box, you can do the following (you might need to install the library first using `pip install more-itertools`):\n\n```python\nfrom more_itertools import windowed\n\nthe_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nfor window in windowed(the_list, 2):  # Change 2 to N for N elements at a time\n    print(window)\n```\n\nBoth methods allow you to iterate over a list in a general way, focusing on N consecutive elements at each step. This is efficient and idiomatic for handling sliding windows in Python."
