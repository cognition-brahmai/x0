When I run tests using the command `./manage.py test`, all the data I send to the standard output via the `print` function does not seem to appear. I notice that when tests fail, an \"stdout\" block appears per failed test. This leads me to believe that Django might be trapping it but does not display it when tests pass. How can I resolve this?"

        "content": "When running Django tests, the `unittest` framework, which Django uses, captures the standard output by default. This is why you don't see the `print` statements when tests pass. However, there are ways to display the standard output while running your tests.\n\nHere are some options you can consider:\n\n1. **Using the `-s` flag with `pytest`:** \n   If you are using or can switch to `pytest` for running your Django tests, you can use the `-s` flag to prevent it from capturing the output. This will display the standard output in the terminal.\n\n   ```bash\n   pytest -s\n   ```\n\n   You can install `pytest` and the Django plugin with:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pytest pytest-django\n   ```\n\n2. **Using `DEBUG` level logging:**\n   You can use logging instead of print statements and configure your logging settings to output DEBUG level logs to the console.\n\n   ```python\n   import logging\n\n   logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n   def your_test_case():\n       logger.debug(\"This will always be shown in the console if DEBUG level is set.\")\n   ```\n\n   Ensure that your logging configuration in `settings.py` outputs DEBUG level logs to the console.\n\n3. **Using the `--no-capture` option:**\n   If you are using Django's `manage.py test` and want to stick with it, you can use the `--no-capture` option to prevent Django from capturing the output. However, this option is not available by default and may require using a custom test runner or modifications to integrate with `pytest` or other solutions.\n\n4. **Modify Django's test runner:**\n   You can write a custom test runner that allows you to see the print statements by subclassing Django's test runner and setting `stdout` to `None`.\n\n   ```python\n   from django.test.runner import DiscoverRunner\n\n   class NoCaptureTestRunner(DiscoverRunner):\n       def run_tests(self, test_labels, extra_tests=None, **kwargs):\n           self.buffer = False\n           return super().run_tests(test_labels, extra_tests, **kwargs)\n   ```\n\n   Then, in your `settings.py`, specify your custom test runner:\n\n   ```python\n   TEST_RUNNER = 'path.to.NoCaptureTestRunner'\n   ```\n\nBy applying one of these methods, you should be able to view the standard output when running your Django tests."
