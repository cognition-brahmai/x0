Here is my current script:\n\n```python\ndef dlfile(file_name,file_mode,base_url):\n    from urllib2 import Request, urlopen, URLError, HTTPError\n\n    #create the url and the request\n    url = base_url + file_name + mid_url + file_name + end_url \n    req = Request(url)\n\n    # Open the url\n    try:\n        f = urlopen(req)\n        print \"downloading \" + url\n\n        # Open our local file for writing\n        local_file = open(file_name, \"wb\" + file_mode)\n        #Write to our local file\n        local_file.write(f.read())\n        local_file.close()\n\n    #handle errors\n    except HTTPError, e:\n        print \"HTTP Error:\",e.code , url\n    except URLError, e:\n        print \"URL Error:\",e.reason , url\n\n# Set the range \nvar_range = range(150,153)\n\n# Iterate over image ranges\nfor index in var_range:\n\n    base_url = 'http://www.archive.org/download/Cory_Doctorow_Podcast_'\n    mid_url = '/Cory_Doctorow_Podcast_'\n    end_url = '_64kb_mp3.zip'\n    #create file name based on known pattern\n    file_name =  str(index) \n    dlfile(file_name,\"wb\",base_url)\n```\n\nThis script was adapted from this source."

        "content": "Certainly! To improve your script for downloading the archived Cory Doctorow podcasts from the Internet Archive, we can make a few changes:\n\n1. **Switch to `urllib` or `requests`:** Since `urllib2` is a Python 2 library and Python 2 is no longer supported, it is better to use Python 3 with `urllib` or the more efficient `requests` library.\n\n2. **String Formatting:** Use Python's f-strings for cleaner string formatting.\n\n3. **File Handling:** Make sure to open the files in the correct mode (`\"wb\"` for binary files) and use context managers to ensure files are properly closed.\n\nHere is a revised script using the `requests` library, which is more robust and easier to use:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef download_file(file_name, base_url):\n    # Create the full URL\n    url = f\"{base_url}{file_name}/Cory_Doctorow_Podcast_{file_name}_64kb_mp3.zip\"\n    print(f\"Downloading {url}\")\n\n    try:\n        # Send a GET request to the URL\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an error for bad responses\n\n        # Open the local file for writing in binary mode\n        with open(f\"{file_name}.zip\", \"wb\") as local_file:\n            local_file.write(response.content)\n        print(f\"Downloaded {file_name}.zip successfully.\")\n\n    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:\n        print(f\"HTTP Error: {e.response.status_code} for URL: {url}\")\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Request Error: {e} for URL: {url}\")\n\n# Set the range\nvar_range = range(150, 153)\n\n# Iterate over each file number in the range\nfor index in var_range:\n    base_url = 'http://www.archive.org/download/Cory_Doctorow_Podcast_'\n    file_name = str(index)\n    download_file(file_name, base_url)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- **Requests Library:** The `requests` library is simpler and more reliable than `urllib2`.\n- **f-Strings:** Used for clear and concise URL construction.\n- **Context Managers:** Used `with open(...)` to ensure files are closed properly after writing.\n- **Error Handling:** Improved with specific exceptions from the `requests` library.\n\nMake sure you have the `requests` library installed. You can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install requests\n```\n\nThis updated script should work efficiently to download the files in the specified range."
