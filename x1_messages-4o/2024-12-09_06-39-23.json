I have checked the PEP8 style guide and a relevant Stack Overflow question but I'm still unsure about the correct naming convention for this. What is the best way to name a module with a two-word name? Should I use \"SconsConfig\", \"scons_config\", \"sconsconfig\" or \"scons.config\"? What should be the name of the single .py file in the module: \"scons-config.py\" or \"scons_config.py\"? Even though the use of underscores is discouraged, should I go with \"sconsconfig\" or \"scons_config\"?"

        "content": "When it comes to naming Python modules, adhering to the PEP 8 style guide is a good practice. PEP 8 recommends using lowercase with underscores for module names, which helps in readability and consistency. Here are some guidelines to help you decide on the naming convention:\n\n1. **Module Name**: Use lowercase with underscores if needed for readability. In your case, \"scons_config\" would be appropriate. Avoid using hyphens because they are not valid characters for Python identifiers.\n\n2. **File Name**: Similarly, the file name for your module should follow the same convention. Use \"scons_config.py\" as the file name.\n\n3. **Package Name**: If you decide to create a package (a directory containing multiple modules), you can name the package \"scons_config\". Inside the package, you can have your module as \"scons_config.py\" and additional modules if needed.\n\n4. **Avoid CamelCase**: CamelCase is typically used for class names in Python, not for module or package names. Therefore, \"SconsConfig\" would not be the standard convention for a module name.\n\n5. **Avoid Dots in Single Module Names**: Using a dot (e.g., \"scons.config\") is reserved for packages where \"scons\" would be a package and \"config\" a module within that package. For a single module, avoid using dots in the name.\n\nBy following these guidelines, your module will be named \"scons_config.py\" and will be easy to import and use in Python projects without encountering naming conflicts or syntax errors."
