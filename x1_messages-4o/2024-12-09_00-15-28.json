I have a query that looks like this:\n\n```python\naddress_table = Table('address',metadata,autoload=True)\naddresses = session.query(addresses_table).filter(addresses_table.c.retired == 1)\n```\nAccording to my research, if I was using the ORM and passed in something like:\n\n```python\naddresses = session.query(Addresses).filter(addresses_table.c.retired == 1)\n```\nI could add a `.delete()` to the query. But, when I try to do this using only tables, I am encountering an error:\n\n```python\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/sqlalchemy/orm/query.py\", line 2146, in delete\n    target_cls = self._mapper_zero().class_\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'class_'\n```\nThis error makes sense as it's a table, not a class. Can you suggest a way that I can delete rows from a table using SQLAlchemy query without using ORM?"

        "content": "Certainly! When you are using SQLAlchemy's Core (non-ORM) features to interact with the database, you can utilize the `delete()` function from the SQLAlchemy expression language to perform delete operations on tables. Since you are working directly with tables, you do not need to use the ORM methods like `.delete()` on a query object.\n\nHere is how you can perform the delete operation using SQLAlchemy Core:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData, Table, delete\n\n# Assuming you have an engine and metadata already\nengine = create_engine('your_connection_string')\nmetadata = MetaData(bind=engine)\n\n# Reflect the table\naddress_table = Table('address', metadata, autoload_with=engine)\n\n# Create a delete statement\ndelete_stmt = delete(address_table).where(address_table.c.retired == 1)\n\n# Execute the statement\nwith engine.connect() as connection:\n    result = connection.execute(delete_stmt)\n    connection.commit()\n\n# Optionally check how many rows were deleted\nprint(f\"Rows deleted: {result.rowcount}\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- Use `Table` to reflect the table schema.\n- Use the `delete()` function to construct a delete statement.\n- Use `engine.connect()` to get a connection and execute the statement.\n- Commit the transaction to ensure the changes are saved to the database.\n- `result.rowcount` will give you the number of rows deleted if you need to know that.\n\nThis approach allows you to delete rows without relying on the ORM and should work efficiently for your use case."
