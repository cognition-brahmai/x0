Here's a simple guide to help you set up a table called `Employees`:\n\n1. **Set Up SQLite:**\n   - Ensure you have SQLite installed on your system. You can download it from the official SQLite website if it's not installed.\n\n2. **Create a Database:**\n   - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n   - Navigate to the directory where you want to create your database.\n   - Run the command: \n     ```bash\n     sqlite3 employees.db\n     ```\n   - This command creates a new database file named `employees.db` and opens the SQLite shell.\n\n3. **Create the Employees Table:**\n   - Once you're in the SQLite shell, use the following SQL command to create a table:\n     ```sql\n     CREATE TABLE Employees (\n         EmployeeID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n         FirstName TEXT NOT NULL,\n         LastName TEXT NOT NULL,\n         Email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n         PhoneNumber TEXT,\n         HireDate DATE NOT NULL,\n         JobTitle TEXT,\n         Salary REAL\n     );\n     ```\n   - This command creates a table named `Employees` with the following columns:\n     - `EmployeeID`: A unique identifier for each employee, automatically incremented.\n     - `FirstName`: The first name of the employee.\n     - `LastName`: The last name of the employee.\n     - `Email`: The email address of the employee, which must be unique.\n     - `PhoneNumber`: The phone number of the employee.\n     - `HireDate`: The date the employee was hired.\n     - `JobTitle`: The job title of the employee.\n     - `Salary`: The salary of the employee.\n\n4. **Verify the Table Creation:**\n   - You can check if the table was created successfully by running:\n     ```sql\n     .tables\n     ```\n   - This command lists all the tables in your database. You should see `Employees` listed.\n\n5. **Insert Data (Optional):**\n   - To insert data into the `Employees` table, use an `INSERT INTO` statement like this:\n     ```sql\n     INSERT INTO Employees (FirstName, LastName, Email, PhoneNumber, HireDate, JobTitle, Salary) \n     VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', '123-456-7890', '2023-10-15', 'Software Developer', 60000.00);\n     ```\n   - Adjust the values to suit your needs.\n\n6. **Exit SQLite Shell:**\n   - To exit the SQLite shell, simply type `.exit` or press `Ctrl+D`.\n\nYou now have a SQLite database with a table called `Employees` ready to store employee data."
