        "content": "I am working with Novelty detection algorithms - Isolation Forest and One Class SVM. My training dataset, consisting of 4-5 features, contains only inlier sample points. I need to classify any new data as an inlier or an outlier and ingest it into another dataframe accordingly. For these algorithms, I need to input the contamination percentage (nu) during the training phase. Given that my training dataset doesn't contain any contamination, do I need to add outliers to the training dataframe and use that outlier fraction as nu? Also, when using the Isolation Forest, I've observed that the outlier percentage changes every time I predict, even though I don't change the model. Is there a way to address this issue without resorting to the Extended Isolation Forest algorithm?"

        "content": "When working with novelty detection algorithms like Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM, setting the contamination parameter (or `nu` for One-Class SVM) is crucial, especially when dealing with a dataset that only contains inliers. Here's how you can handle this:\n\n1. **Contamination/Nu Parameter:**\n   - For **One-Class SVM**, the `nu` parameter represents an upper bound on the fraction of training errors and a lower bound of the support of the decision function. If your training set only contains inliers, you can set `nu` to a small value, reflecting the expected fraction of outliers in your test data. You don't need to artificially add outliers to your training data.\n   - For **Isolation Forest**, the `contamination` parameter is used to define the proportion of outliers in the dataset. If you're confident that your training data is clean, you can set this to a small value that reflects the expected outlier rate in the data you intend to classify.\n\n2. **Handling the Variability in Isolation Forest:**\n   - Isolation Forest is inherently stochastic because it relies on random subsampling and feature selection. This is why you see variability in the outlier detection results across runs.\n   - To mitigate this, you can set a random seed using the `random_state` parameter. This ensures the randomness is consistent across runs and helps produce stable results.\n   - Another approach is to increase the number of trees (`n_estimators`) in the model, which can lead to more stable results.\n\n3. **Alternative Approaches:**\n   - As you mentioned, Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) could provide more stability, but if you want to avoid it, you might consider ensemble techniques. Running multiple instances of Isolation Forest with different seeds and averaging the results can provide more consistent and reliable predictions.\n\n4. **Evaluation and Validation:**\n   - Since your training dataset doesn't contain outliers, it's critical to validate your model on a separate dataset where the outlier proportion is known. This will help you tune the contamination/nu parameter more effectively.\n\nBy carefully setting these parameters and using a consistent random state, you should be able to achieve reliable and stable anomaly detection results without needing to modify your training dataset with artificial outliers."
