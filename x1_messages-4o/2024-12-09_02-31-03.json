The method 'p' is supposed to print the value of 'b', which I aim to default to the value of 'self.a' if no argument is provided. However, I am encountering an error that says \"NameError: name 'self' is not defined\". Why is this error occurring? Here is my code:\n\n```python\nclass A:\n    def __init__(self, a):\n        self.a = a\n\n    def p(self, b=self.a):\n        print b\n```"

        "content": "The error you are encountering is due to how default arguments are handled in Python. Default argument values are evaluated at the time the function is defined, not when it's called. Therefore, using `self.a` as a default value for `b` doesn't work because `self` is not defined at the time the method signature is evaluated.\n\nTo achieve the desired behavior, you can set the default value of `b` to `None` and then assign it to `self.a` within the method if no value is provided. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nclass A:\n    def __init__(self, a):\n        self.a = a\n\n    def p(self, b=None):\n        if b is None:\n            b = self.a\n        print(b)\n\n# Example usage:\nobj = A(10)\nobj.p()      # This will print 10\nobj.p(20)    # This will print 20\n```\n\nIn this modification, if `b` is not provided when `p` is called, it defaults to `None`, and then inside the method, `b` is set to the value of `self.a` if it is still `None`. This way, you can achieve the desired functionality without encountering the error."
