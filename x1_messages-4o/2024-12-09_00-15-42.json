I'm aware that every Neural Network has edge weights associated with them, which are adjusted during the training session, but I'm struggling to understand how this secondary memory operates. Is it like RAM or is it something more concrete like an XML file or a huge array?"

        "content": "In neural networks and machine learning models, the concept of \"memory\" typically refers to the parameters or weights of the model that have been learned during training. These parameters determine how the model makes predictions or classifications.\n\nWhen a program using a neural network is restarted, it retrieves its \"memory\" from a saved state, which is commonly stored in files on disk. This is unlike RAM, where data is lost when the program is closed. Here\u2019s a breakdown of how this memory storage typically works:\n\n1. **Model Weights and Parameters**: During training, a neural network learns by adjusting its weights and biases. These values are what the model retains as \"memory\" to make predictions based on new input data.\n\n2. **Checkpointing**: During or after training, the model's weights can be saved to disk in a process known as checkpointing. These checkpoints are often saved in formats like HDF5 (.h5), Protocol Buffers (.pb), or other binary formats that are efficient for storing large arrays of numbers.\n\n3. **Serialization**: The process of converting the model's weights and architecture into a format that can be easily saved and later loaded is known as serialization. Libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and others have built-in functions to serialize and deserialize models.\n\n4. **File Storage**: The serialized model is stored in a file on disk. This file acts as a more permanent storage solution, akin to storing data in a database or file system, rather than in volatile memory like RAM.\n\n5. **Loading the Model**: When you restart the program, you load the model's architecture and weights from the saved file. This allows the model to continue making predictions or even resume training from where it left off.\n\n6. **Updating the Model**: If the model continues to learn after being loaded, it will update its weights based on new data. These updates can be saved again to disk, creating a new checkpoint that reflects the model's latest state.\n\nThis storage mechanism ensures that the learned parameters are persistent across sessions and can be easily shared or deployed on different systems."
