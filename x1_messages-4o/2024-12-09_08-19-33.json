When I attempted to use `jsonpickle.encode`, it only encoded the query object itself. I also tried `json.dumps(items)` but ended up with a TypeError: `<Product('3', 'some name', 'some desc')> is not JSON serializable`. Is there a default serializer for SQLAlchemy ORM objects to JSON/XML? It seems like a common task to serialize ORM query results nowadays. What I need specifically is to return a JSON or XML data representation of the SQLAlchemy query result, which will be used in a JavaScript datagrid (JQGrid)."

        "content": "When working with SQLAlchemy and needing to serialize query results to JSON, you don't have a built-in method like Django's ORM, but you can achieve this with a bit of custom work. Here's a common approach:\n\n### Custom Serialization Function\n\nYou need to manually convert SQLAlchemy model instances to a dictionary representation, which can then be serialized to JSON. Here\u2019s a basic outline of how you can do it:\n\n1. **Add a `to_dict` Method to Your Model:**\n\n   First, define a method in your SQLAlchemy model that converts the model instance to a dictionary. This can be added to each model class.\n\n   ```python\n   from sqlalchemy.inspection import inspect\n\n   class Product(Base):\n       __tablename__ = 'products'\n       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n       name = Column(String)\n       description = Column(String)\n\n       def to_dict(self):\n           return {c.key: getattr(self, c.key) for c in inspect(self).mapper.column_attrs}\n   ```\n\n2. **Convert Query Results to JSON:**\n\n   After you've defined the `to_dict` method, you can convert your query results to JSON like this:\n\n   ```python\n   from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\n   import json\n\n   Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\n   session = Session()\n\n   # Query your data\n   products = session.query(Product).all()\n\n   # Convert to list of dictionaries\n   products_dict = [product.to_dict() for product in products]\n\n   # Serialize to JSON\n   products_json = json.dumps(products_dict)\n\n   print(products_json)\n   ```\n\n### Using Marshmallow for Serialization\n\nIf you have more complex serialization needs, you might consider using `marshmallow`, which is a library for serializing and deserializing Python objects:\n\n1. **Install Marshmallow:**\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install marshmallow\n   ```\n\n2. **Define a Schema:**\n\n   Define a schema for your SQLAlchemy model.\n\n   ```python\n   from marshmallow import Schema, fields\n\n   class ProductSchema(Schema):\n       id = fields.Int()\n       name = fields.Str()\n       description = fields.Str()\n   ```\n\n3. **Serialize the Query Results:**\n\n   ```python\n   product_schema = ProductSchema(many=True)\n   products_json = product_schema.dumps(products)\n   print(products_json)\n   ```\n\n### XML Serialization\n\nFor XML, you might use libraries like `xmltodict` or `dicttoxml` to convert the dictionary representation into XML format.\n\n- **Convert to XML:**\n\n  ```python\n  from dicttoxml import dicttoxml\n\n  # Assuming products_dict is a list of dictionaries\n  products_xml = dicttoxml(products_dict)\n  print(products_xml)\n  ```\n\nBy using these methods, you can efficiently serialize your SQLAlchemy models into JSON or XML, making it easy to integrate with front-end frameworks like JQGrid."
