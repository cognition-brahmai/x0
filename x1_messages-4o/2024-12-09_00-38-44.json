Even though the debug level is not enabled, the log message is evaluated in each loop iteration which significantly harms performance. In C++, we have the log4cxx package that provides macros to handle this issue. However, as far as I know, Python doesn't have macros. Is there a more efficient way to handle logging in Python to prevent this performance issue?\n\nHere is the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nimport logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\nlogger = logging.getLogger(\"log\")\nwhile True:\n  logger.debug('Stupid log message \" + ' '.join([str(i) for i in range(20)]) )\n  # Do something\n```"

        "content": "In Python, while there aren't macros like in C++, you can optimize logging to avoid the performance hit of constructing log messages when they're not needed. The Python logging library provides a way to handle this by using the logger's `isEnabledFor` method to check if a certain log level is enabled before constructing the log message. This way, the log message is only constructed if the log level is active. Here's how you can optimize your code:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\nlogger = logging.getLogger(\"log\")\n\nwhile True:\n    if logger.isEnabledFor(logging.DEBUG):\n        logger.debug('Stupid log message \"' + ' '.join([str(i) for i in range(20)]))\n    # Do something\n```\n\nIn this version, the `if logger.isEnabledFor(logging.DEBUG):` check is used to determine if the debug level is active. The log message is only constructed and logged if the condition is true. This avoids the unnecessary computation of the log message when the debug level is not enabled, thus improving performance."
