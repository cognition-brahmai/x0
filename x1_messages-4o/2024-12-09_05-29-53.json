I previously found some code that checks if a variable is a number like so: `if type(var) is type(1): ...`. However, the Python style guide, PEP8, advises against this and recommends the use of isinstance() instead. The problem arises because the `numbers` module, which I could use with isinstance(), was only introduced in Python 2.6, and I need my code to be compatible with Python 2.5 and later versions. How can I achieve this since `if isinstance(var, Numbers.number)` is not a valid solution?"

        "content": "To check if a variable is a number in Python 2.5 and later versions, while maintaining compatibility without using the `numbers` module, you can use the `isinstance()` function with the basic numeric types available in Python. In Python, the most common numeric types are `int`, `float`, and `complex`. Since Python 2.5 does not support the `numbers` module, you can create a tuple of these types and use `isinstance()` to check if the variable is an instance of any of these types.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef is_number(var):\n    return isinstance(var, (int, float, complex))\n\n# Example usage:\nvar1 = 42\nvar2 = 3.14\nvar3 = 1 + 2j\nvar4 = \"not a number\"\n\nprint(is_number(var1))  # True\nprint(is_number(var2))  # True\nprint(is_number(var3))  # True\nprint(is_number(var4))  # False\n```\n\nThis function `is_number()` will return `True` if the variable is an instance of `int`, `float`, or `complex`, and `False` otherwise. This approach ensures that the code works in Python 2.5 and later versions, while adhering to the PEP8 style guide's recommendation to use `isinstance()` for type checking."
