I am able to switch between the environments using the command line tool. But, when I try to change the Python interpreter in Pycharm, it only shows me the Anaconda Python 3.5 version. How can I access and select the different Anaconda environment from Pycharm?"

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you set up your Python 2.7 environment in PyCharm:\n\n1. **Open PyCharm**: Start PyCharm and open your project where you want to use the Anaconda environment.\n\n2. **Open Project Settings**: Go to `File` > `Settings` (or `PyCharm` > `Preferences` on macOS).\n\n3. **Project Interpreter**: In the Settings/Preferences dialog, navigate to `Project: <Your Project Name>` > `Python Interpreter`.\n\n4. **Add Interpreter**: Click on the gear icon next to the Python Interpreter dropdown and select `Add...`.\n\n5. **Select Conda Environment**:\n   - Choose `Conda Environment` from the list on the left.\n   - Select the option `Existing environment`.\n   - Click the `...` (browse) button next to the interpreter path field.\n\n6. **Locate the Python Executable**:\n   - Navigate to the directory where your Anaconda environments are installed. By default, this is usually in `C:\\Users\\<Your Username>\\Anaconda3\\envs\\<Your Environment Name>\\`.\n   - Select the `python.exe` file in the `Scripts` directory of your Python 2.7 environment.\n\n7. **Apply and Close**: Once you have selected the correct Python executable, click `OK` to add the interpreter and `Apply` to save the changes.\n\n8. **Verify Interpreter**: Ensure the newly added interpreter is selected for your project.\n\nAfter completing these steps, your PyCharm project should be set up to use the Python 2.7 interpreter from your Anaconda environment. You can now run and debug your code using this setup."
