However, I'm facing issues as my vim is compiled for a particular Python version, which doesn't correspond to my project's Python version. I have Python 2.6.2 and Python 2.7.1 installed and several virtualenvs are created from each version. I'm using Ubuntu 10.04 where the system-default Python is 2.6.5. When I compile vim and call `:python import sys; print(sys.version)` it returns `Python 2.6.5`. When I tried to build vim from source specifying the Python config folder in my virtualenv, it still ends up using the system-wide Python interpreter. Is there any way I can specify the Python interpreter for vim to use?"

        "content": "To compile Vim with a specific Python version on Ubuntu, you need to ensure that Vim is linked against the correct Python version during the build process. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to compile Vim with Python 2.7.1 in your case:\n\n1. **Install Required Dependencies:**\n   Make sure you have the necessary development packages installed for Python and Vim. You might need to install some of these if they're not already present:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install -y build-essential ncurses-dev python-dev python2.7-dev\n   ```\n\n2. **Download Vim Source Code:**\n   Get the latest Vim source code from the official repository or from the version you are targeting:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/vim/vim.git\n   cd vim\n   ```\n\n3. **Clean Previous Builds:**\n   If you\u2019ve previously attempted to compile Vim, clean any old build files:\n\n   ```bash\n   make distclean  # Clean previous configurations\n   ```\n\n4. **Configure Vim with Python 2.7:**\n   When configuring Vim, specify the Python configuration directory of your desired version. This directory typically contains files like `Makefile`, `config.c`, etc., for Python.\n\n   ```bash\n   ./configure --with-features=huge \\\n               --enable-pythoninterp=yes \\\n               --with-python-config-dir=/usr/lib/python2.7/config\n   ```\n\n   You might need to adjust the path for `--with-python-config-dir` based on where Python 2.7 is installed on your system. You can find this path using:\n\n   ```bash\n   python2.7-config --configdir\n   ```\n\n5. **Compile and Install Vim:**\n   Compile and install Vim using the make command:\n\n   ```bash\n   make\n   sudo make install\n   ```\n\n6. **Verify Python Version in Vim:**\n   After installation, check that Vim uses the correct Python version:\n\n   ```vim\n   :python import sys; print(sys.version)\n   ```\n\n   This should now display Python 2.7.1.\n\n7. **Use Virtualenv:**\n   If you want Vim to work within a virtual environment, activate the desired virtualenv before launching Vim. This ensures the Python environment is set up correctly.\n\nIf you find that Vim is still not using the correct Python version, double-check the configuration directory path and ensure that no other Vim installations are interfering. Also, consider specifying the `--prefix` option during configuration to install Vim to a specific directory, avoiding conflicts with system-wide Vim installations."
