That is, I need to verify if every integer in the second list that is common with the first list appears in the same order of indexes as in the first list. I have written a function named 'sublist' to perform this check. However, the function doesn't appear to be working correctly. Can anyone help me understand why this function isn't working as expected? Here is the function I have written:\n\n```python\ndef sublist(lst1,lst2):\n    for i in range(len(lst1)):\n        if lst1[i] not in lst2:\n            return False\n        for j in range(len(lst2)):\n            if (lst1[j] in lst2) and (lst2.index(lst1[i+1]) > lst2.index(lst1[i])):\n                return True\n```"

        "content": "The function you've written has a few issues that might prevent it from working as expected. Let's go through the function and identify the problems:\n\n1. **Index Errors**: When you access `lst1[i+1]`, it can lead to an `IndexError` when `i` is the last index of the list.\n\n2. **Logic of Checking Order**: The logic inside your nested loop is incorrect. You're checking the order in a way that doesn't iterate through both lists properly.\n\n3. **Early Return**: The function can return `True` or `False` prematurely due to the wrong placement of return statements.\n\nHere's a revised version of your function that should work correctly:\n\n```python\ndef sublist(lst1, lst2):\n    # Index to track position in lst2\n    iter_lst2 = iter(lst2)\n    \n    # Loop through each item in lst1\n    for item in lst1:\n        # Try to find the current item in the remaining part of lst2\n        if item in iter_lst2:\n            continue\n        else:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(sublist([1, 3, 5], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Should return True\nprint(sublist([1, 4, 5], [0, 1, 2, 3, 5]))    # Should return False\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Iterator for lst2**: We use an iterator for `lst2` to ensure that each element of `lst1` is found in order and doesn't backtrack.\n\n2. **Check for Presence**: By using `in iter_lst2`, we check if each element of `lst1` can be found sequentially in `lst2`.\n\n3. **Continue and Return**: If an element is found, we continue checking the next element. If an element is not found, we return `False`. If all elements are found in order, the function returns `True` at the end.\n\nThis approach ensures we maintain the order and checks for sublist without unnecessary complications."
