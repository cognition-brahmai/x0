For example, the function accepts `((2,2),(2,-2))`, but does not accept `numpy.array(((2,2),(2,-2)))` or `[[2,2],[2,-2]]`. Is there an efficient way to convert the numpy array to a tuple without manually looping through and creating a new tuple?"

        "content": "You can convert a NumPy array into a nested tuple efficiently without manually looping through it by using the `map` function along with the `tuple` constructor. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\nSuppose you have a NumPy array `arr` with dimensions 2xN. You can convert it into a nested tuple like this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Example 2xN numpy array\narr = np.array([[2, 2], [2, -2]])\n\n# Convert the numpy array to a nested tuple\nnested_tuple = tuple(map(tuple, arr))\n\nprint(nested_tuple)  # Output: ((2, 2), (2, -2))\n```\n\nHere's what happens in this code:\n- `map(tuple, arr)` applies the `tuple` function to each sub-array in the NumPy array `arr`. This converts each row of the array into a tuple.\n- `tuple(...)` then takes the iterable produced by `map` and converts it into a tuple of tuples.\n\nThis method is efficient and leverages Python's built-in functions to achieve the desired conversion without explicit loops."
