        "content": "One of the least known ancient Greek epic poems is the \"Little Iliad\" (Greek: \u1f38\u03bb\u03b9\u1f70\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac), attributed to Lesches of Pyrrha. It is part of the Epic Cycle, a collection of ancient Greek epic poems that narrate the story of the Trojan War and its aftermath. The \"Little Iliad\" is believed to have been composed in the 7th century BCE. However, it's important to note that the poem has not survived in its entirety, and our knowledge of it comes from summaries and references by later authors."
