        "content": "In Python, the modulo operator `%` is used to find the remainder of the division of one number by another. In the given Python code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom math import *\n3.14 % 2 * pi\n```\n\nHere's how the code works step-by-step:\n\n1. **Modulo Operation (`3.14 % 2`)**: This operation calculates the remainder when `3.14` is divided by `2`. Since `3.14` is a floating-point number, the modulo operation will also yield a floating-point result. \n\n   - When dividing `3.14` by `2`, you get `1` as the integer quotient and `1.14` as the remainder. Therefore, `3.14 % 2` evaluates to `1.14`.\n\n2. **Multiplication (`1.14 * pi`)**: The result of the modulo operation (`1.14`) is then multiplied by `pi` (approximately `3.141592653589793`), which is imported from the `math` module.\n\n   - So, the final calculation is `1.14 * pi`, which yields approximately `3.581415625092364`.\n\nThus, the modulo operator is used to find the remainder of the division, and when involving floating-point numbers, it returns a floating-point remainder. The final expression evaluates to the product of this remainder and `pi`."
