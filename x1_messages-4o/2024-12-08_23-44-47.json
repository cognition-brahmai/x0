        "content": "To modify the MATLAB code to work with larger datasets or a longer time frame, you should generalize the code to handle any number of days for the first and last periods. You can achieve this by using variables to define the range of days for each period. Here's how you can modify the code:\n\n```matlab\n% Example data: replace these with your actual data\ndata = [100, 150, 200, 175, 225, 250, 300]; % Sample data for a week\n\n% Define the number of days for each period\nnumDaysFirstPeriod = 3;\nnumDaysLastPeriod = 4;\n\n% Ensure the dataset length matches the sum of both periods\nif length(data) ~= (numDaysFirstPeriod + numDaysLastPeriod)\n    error('The length of the data does not match the specified number of days for both periods.');\nend\n\n% Extract data for each period\nfirstPeriodData = data(1:numDaysFirstPeriod);\nlastPeriodData = data(numDaysFirstPeriod+1:end);\n\n% Calculate total traffic, traffic before, and traffic after\ntotalTraffic = sum(data);\ntrafficBefore = sum(firstPeriodData);\ntrafficAfter = sum(lastPeriodData);\n\n% Calculate percentage change\npercentChange = (trafficAfter/totalTraffic - trafficBefore/totalTraffic) * 100;\n\n% Display the result\nfprintf('Percentage change in website traffic: %.2f%%\\n', percentChange);\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Input Data**: The `data` array contains the number of website clicks for each day. You need to replace this with your actual data.\n\n2. **Number of Days**: The variables `numDaysFirstPeriod` and `numDaysLastPeriod` define how many days are in each period. You can adjust these according to your needs.\n\n3. **Data Validation**: The `if` statement checks if the length of the data matches the expected number of days for both periods combined. This ensures the dataset is split correctly.\n\n4. **Data Extraction**: The code extracts the relevant data for the first and last periods using indexing.\n\n5. **Calculation**: It calculates total traffic, traffic for each period, and the percentage change.\n\n6. **Output**: The result is displayed using `fprintf`.\n\nThis approach allows you to easily adjust the number of days for each period without manually changing the code logic."
