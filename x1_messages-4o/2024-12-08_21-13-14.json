And can you explain how this algorithm can be used to efficiently search for a particular value in a sorted array?\nHere's an example implementation of a binary search algorithm in C++:\n```c++\nint binarySearch(int arr[], int l, int r, int x) {\n    if (r >= l) {\n        int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;\n        if (arr[mid] == x) {\n            return mid;\n        }\n        if (arr[mid] > x) {\n            return binarySearch(arr, l, mid - 1, x);\n        }\n        return binarySearch(arr, mid + 1, r, x);\n    }\n    return -1;\n}\n```\nTo use this algorithm, you simply call the `binarySearch` function with the array to search, the left and right indices of the subarray to search, and the value you're looking for. The function returns the index of the value if it's found, or `-1` if it's not present in the array.\nRemember to use clear and descriptive variable names, and to properly comment your code to make it easier to understand and maintain."

        "content": "To implement a binary search algorithm in C++ while adhering to formal and professional writing standards, it's crucial to ensure that the code is clean, well-documented, and utilizes descriptive variable names. Below is an enhanced version of the binary search algorithm, along with a detailed explanation of how the algorithm works:\n\n### Binary Search Implementation in C++\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n\n/**\n * @brief Performs binary search on a sorted array to find the index of a target value.\n * \n * @param array The sorted array to search.\n * @param left The starting index of the subarray to search.\n * @param right The ending index of the subarray to search.\n * @param target The value to search for.\n * @return The index of the target value if found, otherwise -1.\n */\nint binarySearch(const std::vector<int>& array, int left, int right, int target) {\n    while (left <= right) {\n        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;  // Calculate the middle index\n\n        // Check if the target is present at mid\n        if (array[mid] == target) {\n            return mid;\n        }\n\n        // If target is greater, ignore the left half\n        if (array[mid] < target) {\n            left = mid + 1;\n        }\n        // If target is smaller, ignore the right half\n        else {\n            right = mid - 1;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Target is not present in array\n    return -1;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    // Example sorted array\n    std::vector<int> sortedArray = {2, 3, 4, 10, 40};\n    int targetValue = 10;\n\n    // Perform binary search\n    int result = binarySearch(sortedArray, 0, sortedArray.size() - 1, targetValue);\n\n    // Output the result\n    if (result != -1) {\n        std::cout << \"Element found at index: \" << result << std::endl;\n    } else {\n        std::cout << \"Element not found in the array.\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Binary Search Algorithm\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: The binary search algorithm requires a sorted array. It operates by dividing the array into halves and comparing the target value to the middle element of the array.\n\n2. **Calculate Midpoint**: The midpoint is calculated using `mid = left + (right - left) / 2` to prevent potential overflow issues that can arise with large indices.\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n   - If the target value is equal to the middle element, the search is complete, and the index is returned.\n   - If the target value is greater than the middle element, the search continues in the right half of the array (`left = mid + 1`).\n   - If the target value is less than the middle element, the search continues in the left half of the array (`right = mid - 1`).\n\n4. **Repeat**: The process repeats until the target value is found or the subarray reduces to zero size (`left` exceeds `right`).\n\n5. **Efficiency**: The binary search algorithm has a time complexity of O(log n), making it significantly more efficient than linear search algorithms for large datasets.\n\n6. **Return Value**: If the target value is found, its index in the array is returned. If the target is not found, the function returns `-1`.\n\nBy following these practices and documenting your code with comments and proper function descriptions, you ensure that the implementation is both professional and easy to maintain."
