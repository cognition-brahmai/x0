        "content": "Certainly! Let's go through each of these operators in Python:\n\n1. ** (Exponentiation): \n   - This operator is used to raise a number to the power of another number. \n   - For example, `x ** y` will compute \\( x^y \\). If `x` is 2 and `y` is 3, then `2 ** 3` will result in 8.\n\n2. ^ (Bitwise XOR): \n   - This operator performs a bitwise exclusive OR operation. It compares each bit of two numbers and returns a new number whose bits are set to 1 only if the corresponding bits of the original numbers are different.\n   - For instance, `5 ^ 3` is calculated as follows:\n     - 5 in binary is `101`\n     - 3 in binary is `011`\n     - XOR result is `110`, which is 6 in decimal.\n\n3. % (Modulus): \n   - This operator returns the remainder of the division of two numbers.\n   - For example, `x % y` results in the remainder when `x` is divided by `y`. If `x` is 10 and `y` is 3, then `10 % 3` is 1 because 10 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1.\n   - The modulus operator does not only return a normal remainder when `m < x`. It returns the remainder regardless of the values of `m` and `x`. The behavior is consistent; for negative numbers, it returns a remainder that is consistent with the floor division.\n\n4. // (Floor Division): \n   - This operator performs division and returns the largest possible integer that is less than or equal to the division result.\n   - For instance, `x // y` is the floor of `x` divided by `y`. If `x` is 10 and `y` is 3, then `10 // 3` will result in 3.\n\nRegarding your point about the modulus operator: the `%` operator in Python returns the remainder of the division `x` by `m`, and this is true for any integer values of `x` and `m`. It's important to note that if `x` is less than `m`, the result will simply be `x` because `x` cannot be divided by `m` to produce a non-zero quotient. However, if `x` is negative, Python's `%` will return a result consistent with the formula `x % m = x - m * (x // m)`, ensuring the result has the same sign as the divisor `m`."
