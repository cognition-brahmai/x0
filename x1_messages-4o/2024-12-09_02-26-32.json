This method returns the number of bits necessary to represent the integer in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros.\n\nHere's how you can use it:\n\n```python\n# Example integer\nnumber = 10\n\n# Determine the minimum bit length\nmin_bits = number.bit_length()\n\nprint(f\"The minimum bit length needed to represent {number} is {min_bits} bits.\")\n```\n\nFor your examples:\n- For the integer `1`, `1.bit_length()` returns `1`.\n- For the integer `5`, `5.bit_length()` returns `3`.\n- For the integer `10`, `10.bit_length()` returns `4`.\n\nThis method provides a straightforward way to calculate the minimum number of bits needed to represent any positive integer in binary form."
