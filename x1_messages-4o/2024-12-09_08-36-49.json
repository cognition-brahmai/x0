        "content": "To resolve the \"ImportError: Could not find 'cudart64_100.dll'\" issue when installing `tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0-beta1`, you need to ensure that your system is correctly set up to use the GPU with TensorFlow. Here are the steps you can follow to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Verify CUDA Version Compatibility**:\n   - TensorFlow 2.0.0-beta1 is compatible with CUDA 10.0. Make sure you have installed this specific version of CUDA Toolkit.\n\n2. **Check CUDA Installation**:\n   - Ensure that CUDA is installed in a directory like `C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v10.0`.\n   - Confirm that `cudart64_100.dll` is located under the `bin` directory within your CUDA installation path, like `C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v10.0\\bin`.\n\n3. **Update %PATH% Environment Variable**:\n   - Add the path to the CUDA `bin` directory to your system's PATH environment variable:\n     1. Right-click on \"This PC\" or \"My Computer\" on your desktop and select \"Properties\".\n     2. Click on \"Advanced system settings\" and then \"Environment Variables\".\n     3. Locate the \"Path\" variable in the \"System variables\" section and click \"Edit\".\n     4. Add a new entry for the CUDA `bin` directory, e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v10.0\\bin`.\n     5. Also, add the `libnvvp` directory, e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v10.0\\libnvvp`.\n\n4. **Verify cuDNN Installation**:\n   - Make sure you have the correct version of cuDNN that corresponds with CUDA 10.0. As of TensorFlow 2.0.0-beta1, the expected version might be cuDNN 7.4.\n   - Extract the cuDNN files into the CUDA Toolkit directory, ensuring they are in the appropriate folders (`bin`, `include`, `lib`).\n\n5. **Check NVIDIA Driver**:\n   - Ensure that your NVIDIA GPU drivers are up to date and compatible with CUDA 10.0.\n\n6. **Reboot Your System**:\n   - After making changes to your PATH or installing new software, reboot your computer to ensure that all changes take effect.\n\n7. **Verify Installation**:\n   - After rebooting, open a Command Prompt and run `nvcc --version` to ensure the CUDA compiler is available.\n   - You can also use `nvidia-smi` to check the status of your GPU drivers and CUDA runtime.\n\n8. **Testing TensorFlow**:\n   - Create a simple Python script to test if TensorFlow is able to utilize the GPU. You can use:\n     ```python\n     import tensorflow as tf\n     print(\"Num GPUs Available: \", len(tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')))\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error and successfully run TensorFlow with GPU support on your Windows 10 machine."
