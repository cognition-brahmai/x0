Additionally, how does matplotlib identify outliers? How does it determine that they are not the true max and min values?"

        "content": "In a boxplot created with Matplotlib, the markers Q1, Q2, and Q3 represent specific statistical measures related to the dataset, specifically quartiles:\n\n1. **Q1 (First Quartile):** This is the median of the lower half of the dataset. It represents the 25th percentile, meaning that 25% of the data points are below this value.\n\n2. **Q2 (Second Quartile or Median):** This is the median of the entire dataset. It represents the 50th percentile, meaning that 50% of the data points are below this value. Q2 is a central measure of the dataset, indicating the middle value when the data points are sorted in order.\n\n3. **Q3 (Third Quartile):** This is the median of the upper half of the dataset. It represents the 75th percentile, meaning that 75% of the data points are below this value.\n\nRegarding outliers, Matplotlib identifies them using the interquartile range (IQR), which is the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). The common method for identifying outliers is:\n\n- A data point is considered an outlier if it is below Q1 - 1.5 * IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 * IQR.\n\nThese thresholds help determine that certain data points are not considered true minimum or maximum values because they fall outside the expected range defined by the distribution of the majority of the data. Outliers are often visualized as individual points outside the \"whiskers\" of the boxplot, which extend to the lowest and highest values within the 1.5 * IQR range from Q1 and Q3, respectively."
