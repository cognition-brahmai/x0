I am wondering if there is a way to match items in the list with case insensitivity or if I need to create a custom method for this. Is there a need to write extra code to achieve case insensitive matching in this scenario?"

        "content": "To achieve case-insensitive matching in a list, you can convert both the elements of the list and the string you are searching for to the same case (either lower or upper) before performing the comparison. This way, you don't need to write a custom method; you can achieve it using a simple list comprehension or generator expression. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Example list of usernames\nUSERNAMES = ['johnDoe', 'JaneSmith', 'MICHAEL89', 'alice123']\n\n# Convert both the list items and the target username to the same case (lower in this example)\nif any(username.lower() == 'michael89'.lower() for username in USERNAMES):\n    print(\"Username found!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Username not found.\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `any()` function is used with a generator expression that converts each username in the `USERNAMES` list to lowercase and checks it against the lowercase version of `'MICHAEL89'`. This approach ensures case-insensitive matching without the need for additional custom methods."
