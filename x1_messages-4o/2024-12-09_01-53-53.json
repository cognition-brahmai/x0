        "content": "The error message you're encountering, `OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied`, indicates that the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` doesn't have the necessary permissions to write to the directory `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/`. This is a common issue when trying to install packages globally without superuser privileges.\n\nHere are a few ways to resolve this:\n\n1. **Use `sudo`:** If you're trying to install the packages globally and you have administrative privileges, you can prepend `sudo` to your command to give it the necessary permissions:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n2. **Use a Virtual Environment:** It's generally a good practice to use a virtual environment for your Django projects. This avoids permission issues and keeps your project's dependencies isolated from other projects and the system's Python packages.\n\n   Here's how you can set up a virtual environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   # Install virtualenv if you haven't already\n   pip install virtualenv\n\n   # Create a virtual environment\n   virtualenv venv\n\n   # Activate the virtual environment\n   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`\n\n   # Install the requirements\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n   When you're done working in the virtual environment, you can deactivate it by simply typing `deactivate`.\n\n3. **Use the `--user` flag:** If you want to install the packages for the current user only, you can use the `--user` flag. This will install the packages in a user-specific directory rather than a system-wide location:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --user -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\nChoose the solution that best fits your needs. For most development work, using a virtual environment is the recommended approach as it provides isolation and avoids cluttering the system Python environment."
