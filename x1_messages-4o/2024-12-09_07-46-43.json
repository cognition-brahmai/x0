        "content": "I have recently started using Python 3.5 and I have noticed that the new matrix multiplication operator (@) sometimes behaves differently from the numpy dot operator. For example, when I use these operators on 3d arrays, the '@' operator returns an array of shape (8, 13, 13) while the 'np.dot()' function returns an array of shape (8, 13, 8, 13). How can I get the same result with numpy dot as I do with '@' operator? Are there any other significant differences between these two?\n\nHere is the code I'm working with:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.random.rand(8,13,13)\nb = np.random.rand(8,13,13)\nc = a @ b  # Python 3.5+\nd = np.dot(a, b)\n\nprint(\"Shape of c:\", c.shape)\nprint(\"Shape of d:\", d.shape)\n```"

        "content": "The difference you're observing between the `@` operator and `np.dot()` when applied to 3D arrays is due to how these operations handle the dimensions of the arrays.\n\n1. **`@` Operator (Matrix Multiplication Operator):**\n\n   The `@` operator is designed to perform matrix multiplication. When used with 3D arrays, it performs a stack of matrix multiplications along the last two dimensions. This means that for each pair of matrices from the two arrays (in your case, 8 pairs of 13x13 matrices), it performs standard matrix multiplication, resulting in an array of shape (8, 13, 13).\n\n2. **`np.dot()` Function:**\n\n   On the other hand, `np.dot()` behaves differently with multi-dimensional arrays. It treats the arrays as stacks of vectors and matrices and performs a generalized dot product that results in a shape that combines all dimensions, hence the shape (8, 13, 8, 13).\n\nTo make `np.dot()` behave like the `@` operator for your specific case, you can use `np.matmul()` instead, which is equivalent to the `@` operator:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.random.rand(8, 13, 13)\nb = np.random.rand(8, 13, 13)\nc = a @ b  # Python 3.5+\nd = np.matmul(a, b)  # Equivalent to a @ b\n\nprint(\"Shape of c:\", c.shape)\nprint(\"Shape of d:\", d.shape)\n```\n\nUsing `np.matmul()` will give you the same shape result as the `@` operator, which is (8, 13, 13) in your provided example.\n\n### Other Differences:\n\n- **Broadcasting:** `np.matmul()` and the `@` operator support broadcasting in a limited form, similar to element-wise operations, which can be quite powerful.\n\n- **Handling Multi-dimensional Arrays:** `np.dot()` is more flexible with multi-dimensional arrays but might not give you the expected results if you are looking for typical matrix multiplication behavior beyond two-dimensional arrays.\n\nIn general, for matrix multiplication, prefer using `@` or `np.matmul()` to avoid unexpected results, especially when dealing with multi-dimensional arrays."
