        "content": "To achieve the task of generating a series of unique words in Scala where no word is an antonym or synonym of any other word in the list, and using the WordNet library to verify antonyms and synonyms, you can follow the steps below. Note that you need to have the WordNet library integrated into your Scala project. This can be done by adding a suitable library dependency in your `build.sbt` file.\n\nHere's a Scala program to generate a list of unique words:\n\n```scala\nimport scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer\nimport scala.util.Random\n\n// Assuming you have a WordNet library imported and configured\nobject WordGenerator {\n\n  // This is a stub for WordNet integration\n  // Replace with actual WordNet API calls\n  object WordNet {\n    def getAntonyms(word: String): List[String] = {\n      // Implement actual logic to get antonyms using WordNet\n      List()\n    }\n\n    def getSynonyms(word: String): List[String] = {\n      // Implement actual logic to get synonyms using WordNet\n      List()\n    }\n  }\n\n  def generateUniqueWords(count: Int): List[String] = {\n    val words = ListBuffer[String]()\n    val random = new Random()\n\n    while (words.length < count) {\n      // Generate a random word (for demonstration, using alphanumeric)\n      val newWord = random.alphanumeric.take(9).mkString\n\n      // Check if the new word is not an antonym or synonym of any existing word\n      if (!words.exists(w => WordNet.getAntonyms(w).contains(newWord) || WordNet.getSynonyms(w).contains(newWord))) {\n        words += newWord\n      }\n    }\n\n    words.toList\n  }\n\n  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\n    val uniqueWords = generateUniqueWords(7)\n    println(\"Generated words: \" + uniqueWords.mkString(\", \"))\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Key Considerations:\n1. **WordNet Integration**: Ensure you have a working WordNet API or library that can fetch antonyms and synonyms. The stubs in the code (`getAntonyms` and `getSynonyms`) need to be replaced with actual calls to the WordNet library.\n   \n2. **Random Word Generation**: The code uses `Random.alphanumeric.take(9).mkString` to generate random words. You might want to replace this with a more sophisticated word generation mechanism if you need real words instead of random character sequences.\n\n3. **Performance**: The loop will continue attempting to generate words until the desired count is reached. Depending on the constraints (e.g., word length, dictionary size), this could be inefficient. Adjust parameters or logic based on actual use case requirements.\n\n4. **Dependency Management**: Add the WordNet library in your `build.sbt` as a dependency to ensure the WordNet functionalities can be used in your project.\n\nBy following these steps, you can generate a list of unique words while ensuring they are neither synonyms nor antonyms of each other using Scala."
