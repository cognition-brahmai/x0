The method np.isnan(X) is not feasible as it builds a boolean array of shape X.shape, which could potentially be huge. I tried np.nan in X, but it doesn't seem to work because np.nan != np.nan. The size of the array is unknown as this is for input validation in library code."

        "content": "When dealing with the challenge of detecting the presence of `np.nan` in a potentially large NumPy array without creating an additional large boolean array, you can use a more memory-efficient approach. You can leverage the fact that `np.nan` is not equal to itself and use a combination of NumPy and Python constructs to achieve this. Here's a method that iterates efficiently through the array:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef contains_nan(X):\n    # Use NumPy's `flat` iterator to traverse the array\n    flat_X = X.flat\n    for element in flat_X:\n        # Check if the element is NaN using its property of being not equal to itself\n        if element != element:\n            return True\n    return False\n\n# Example usage:\n# X = np.array([1, 2, np.nan, 4])\n# print(contains_nan(X))  # Output: True\n```\n\nThis method uses the `flat` attribute of the NumPy array, which provides an iterator that allows you to efficiently traverse the elements of the array without generating an additional large boolean array. The check `element != element` is a common way to detect NaN values because NaN is the only number that is not equal to itself. This approach works well for both dense and sparse arrays."
