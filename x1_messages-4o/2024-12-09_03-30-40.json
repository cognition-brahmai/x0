        "content": "The syntax you're using to pass additional key-value pairs along with an unpacked dictionary into a function call is actually correct in Python, and should not result in a `SyntaxError`. The code you provided should work as intended in Python 3.x. Here's a quick explanation of how it works:\n\n```python\ndef f(**kwargs):\n    print(kwargs)\n\npre_defined_kwargs = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n\nf(**pre_defined_kwargs, c=3)  # This should print: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\nf(**pre_defined_kwargs, b=3)  # This should print: {'a': 1, 'b': 3}\n```\n\nIf you're encountering a `SyntaxError`, it's possible that there might be another issue elsewhere in your code, or you might be running the code in an environment that doesn't fully support Python 3.x features (although this would be unusual, as unpacking dictionaries in this way is supported in all Python 3 versions).\n\nHere are a few things to check:\n\n1. **Python Version**: Make sure you are using Python 3.x. You can check your Python version by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal.\n\n2. **Environment**: Ensure your execution environment supports Python 3.x syntax. Some older systems or very restricted environments might have issues, although this is rare.\n\n3. **Code Context**: Double-check the surrounding code to ensure there are no additional syntax errors or issues that could be affecting this particular line.\n\n4. **Typos or Misplacements**: Ensure there are no extra characters, misplaced parentheses, or other syntax errors outside the snippet provided.\n\nIf everything checks out but the error persists, try running the code in a different Python environment or IDE to see if the issue is specific to your current setup."
