        "content": "The error you're encountering typically occurs when the Pandas library is not imported correctly or at all in your script. To resolve the issue, ensure that you have imported Pandas before using the `get_dummies` function. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Import Pandas**: Make sure you have the Pandas library installed and imported in your script. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pandas\n   ```\n\n   Then, import Pandas at the beginning of your script:\n\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n   ```\n\n2. **Using `get_dummies`**: Once Pandas is imported, you can use the `get_dummies` function to create dummy variables from a categorical variable. Here\u2019s an example:\n\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n\n   # Sample data\n   df = pd.DataFrame({\n       'Category': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B']\n   })\n\n   # Create dummy variables\n   dummies = pd.get_dummies(df['Category'], prefix='Category')\n\n   # Concatenate the dummy variables with the original dataframe\n   df = pd.concat([df, dummies], axis=1)\n\n   print(df)\n   ```\n\n   This will output:\n\n   ```\n     Category  Category_A  Category_B  Category_C\n   0        A           1           0           0\n   1        B           0           1           0\n   2        C           0           0           1\n   3        A           1           0           0\n   4        B           0           1           0\n   ```\n\n3. **Alternative Method**: If you prefer not to use `get_dummies`, you can manually create dummy variables using loops or list comprehensions, but `get_dummies` is the most efficient and straightforward method in Pandas.\n\nBy ensuring that Pandas is imported correctly, you should be able to use the `get_dummies` function without encountering the \"name is not defined\" error."
