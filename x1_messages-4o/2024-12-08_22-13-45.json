To find the total mass \\( M \\), you calculate the area of the circle and multiply it by the mass density:\n\n\\[ M = \\text{mass density} \\times \\text{area} = 3 \\, \\text{kg/m}^2 \\times \\pi \\times (0.1 \\, \\text{m})^2 \\]\n\nThen, substitute \\( M \\) and \\( R \\) into the moment of inertia formula to find the result."
