My project involves assigning user requests that pass to a web framework to different machines and then returning the results. I've gone through the documentation but I didn't find any information on setting up multiple machines. Can anyone guide me on how to set up Celery workers on separate machines?"

        "content": "Setting up Celery to distribute tasks across multiple machines can be a great way to scale your application. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:\n\n### 1. Infrastructure Setup\n\n1. **Redis or RabbitMQ**: Ensure you have a message broker like Redis or RabbitMQ set up. This broker will be responsible for distributing tasks to the workers. It should be accessible by all the machines you plan to use as workers.\n\n2. **Shared Codebase**: Ensure that the same codebase is available on all machines. This includes your Celery tasks and any other necessary modules.\n\n### 2. Install Celery\n\nYou need to have Celery installed on all machines that will act as workers. You can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install celery\n```\n\n### 3. Configure Celery\n\nCreate a configuration file (e.g., `celeryconfig.py`) and place it in your project directory. This file should be accessible by all machines. Here\u2019s a basic configuration example:\n\n```python\nbroker_url = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'  # or your RabbitMQ URL\nresult_backend = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'\n```\n\nEnsure that the `broker_url` and `result_backend` point to your message broker.\n\n### 4. Define Celery Tasks\n\nDefine your tasks in a Python file, for example `tasks.py`:\n\n```python\nfrom celery import Celery\n\napp = Celery('tasks', broker='redis://localhost:6379/0')\n\n@app.task\ndef add(x, y):\n    return x + y\n```\n\n### 5. Start Celery Workers on Each Machine\n\nOn each machine, navigate to the directory containing your `tasks.py` file and start a Celery worker:\n\n```bash\ncelery -A tasks worker --loglevel=info\n```\n\nReplace `tasks` with the name of your Python module containing the Celery app.\n\n### 6. Distribute Tasks\n\nNow, you can distribute tasks to workers from any machine that has access to the message broker. For example:\n\n```python\nfrom tasks import add\n\nresult = add.delay(4, 6)\nprint(\"Task result:\", result.get())\n```\n\nThis will add a task to the queue, and one of the workers will pick it up and execute it.\n\n### 7. Monitoring and Scaling\n\n- **Flower**: Use Flower for monitoring your Celery workers. You can start it with the following command:\n\n  ```bash\n  celery -A tasks flower\n  ```\n\n  Access the Flower dashboard in your web browser to monitor tasks and worker status.\n\n- **Scaling**: To scale, simply start more worker instances on additional machines using the same command as above.\n\n### 8. Security and Networking\n\nEnsure that your message broker is secured and accessible only by your application servers. Use firewalls and network configurations to restrict access.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to distribute and manage Celery tasks across multiple machines effectively. If you encounter specific issues, you can provide logs or error messages for more detailed troubleshooting."
