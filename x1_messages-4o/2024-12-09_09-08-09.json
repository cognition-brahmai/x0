Below is a step-by-step guide to help you create a basic web server that can host your website.\n\n### Step 1: Install Node.js\nEnsure that Node.js is installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).\n\n### Step 2: Set Up Your Project\n1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:\n   ```bash\n   mkdir my-web-server\n   cd my-web-server\n   ```\n\n2. Initialize a new Node.js project:\n   ```bash\n   npm init -y\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Create a Simple Web Server\n1. Create a file named `server.js` in your project directory.\n\n2. Add the following code to `server.js`:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const http = require('http');\n\n   const hostname = '127.0.0.1';\n   const port = 3000;\n\n   const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {\n     res.statusCode = 200;\n     res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');\n     res.end('<h1>Hello, World!</h1><p>Welcome to my web server!</p>');\n   });\n\n   server.listen(port, hostname, () => {\n     console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);\n   });\n   ```\n\n### Step 4: Run Your Web Server\n1. Open your terminal and ensure you're in the project directory.\n\n2. Start the server with the following command:\n   ```bash\n   node server.js\n   ```\n\n3. You should see the message `Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/` in the terminal.\n\n### Step 5: Access Your Web Server\n- Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`. You should see the message \"Hello, World!\" displayed.\n\n### Step 6: Expand Your Web Server\n- To serve actual HTML files, you can use the `fs` module to read files from your filesystem and send them as a response.\n- For more advanced features, consider using frameworks like **Express.js** which simplify the process of handling requests, routing, and middleware.\n\n### Additional Tips\n- **Express.js**: Install it using `npm install express` and refactor your server to use Express for easier routing and middleware support.\n- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling to manage server errors gracefully.\n- **Static Files**: Use middleware like `express.static` to serve static files such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n\nThis basic setup will get you started with hosting your website using Node.js. As you become more familiar with Node.js, you can expand your server's capabilities to handle more complex tasks."
