For example, I have a string \"where did I put my cupcake this morning\", and I want to insert 1 'L' at the start and 2 'L's at the end, resulting in \"Lwhere did I put my cupcake this morningLL\". Could you provide a solution for this?"

Here is how you can insert characters at the start and end of a string:\n\n```python\n# Original string\noriginal_string = \"where did I put my cupcake this morning\"\n\n# Characters to be inserted\nstart_character = 'L'\nend_characters = 'LL'\n\n# Insert characters at the start and end\nmodified_string = start_character + original_string + end_characters\n\n# Print the result\nprint(modified_string)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\nLwhere did I put my cupcake this morningLL\n```\n\nThis code concatenates the `start_character` to the beginning of `original_string` and `end_characters` to the end of `original_string`, resulting in the desired modified string."
