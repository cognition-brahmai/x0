This is strange because 'sys' is a built-in module, and I didn't have any problem importing the 'traceback' module which implies that I've correctly pointed PyCharm at the Python interpreter. In addition, the IDE doesn't offer 'sys' for auto-complete after typing 'import sy'. However, when I start the interpreter the IDE uses from the command line, 'import sys' works fine. Any ideas on how to resolve this issue?\n\n```python\nimport traceback\nimport sys\n```"

        "content": "It sounds like you're encountering a configuration issue with PyCharm rather than a problem with Python itself. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check the Python Interpreter in PyCharm**:\n   - Go to `File` -> `Settings` (or `PyCharm` -> `Preferences` on macOS).\n   - Navigate to `Project: <your_project_name>` -> `Python Interpreter`.\n   - Make sure the interpreter listed is the one you expect (e.g., Python 2.7). If not, configure it to point to the correct Python executable.\n\n2. **Invalidate Caches/Restart**:\n   - Sometimes, PyCharm's cache can cause issues. You can try invalidating the cache and restarting the IDE.\n   - Go to `File` -> `Invalidate Caches / Restart`.\n   - Click on `Invalidate and Restart`. This will clear PyCharm's caches and restart the IDE.\n\n3. **Check for Virtual Environment**:\n   - Ensure you are not using a virtual environment that might be misconfigured.\n   - If you are using a virtual environment, make sure it is activated and configured properly in PyCharm.\n\n4. **Reinstall Python**:\n   - If the above steps don't work, consider reinstalling Python 2.7 to ensure there are no issues with the installation.\n\n5. **Check the Environment Variables**:\n   - Make sure your system's `PATH` environment variable includes the path to the Python 2.7 executable.\n   - You can check this by running `echo $PATH` on macOS/Linux or `echo %PATH%` on Windows in the command line.\n\n6. **Check for Conflicting Modules**:\n   - Ensure there isn't a file named `sys.py` in your project or its directories, as this could shadow the built-in `sys` module.\n\n7. **Verify PyCharm's Indexing**:\n   - Allow PyCharm some time to index the project files when you first open it. This process is indicated in the bottom status bar, and until it finishes, some features like auto-complete might not work correctly.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully import the `sys` module in PyCharm."
