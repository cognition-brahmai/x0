However, when I try to run the command \"$ sudo pip3 install --upgrade $TF_BINARY_URL\" in the terminal, I get \"sudo: pip3: command not found\" error. I have attempted to resolve this by installing Homebrew and trying to uninstall and reinstall python3-pip, I received the following errors: \"Error: No such keg: /usr/local/Cellar/python3-pip\" and \"Error: No available formula with the name &quot;python3-pip&quot;\". I also tried running \"python3 -m pip\" and \"sudo which pip3 install --upgrade $TF_BINARY_URL\", but got error messages and unclear outputs respectively. How can I solve this issue and successfully get pip3?"

        "content": "To resolve the issue of installing TensorFlow on macOS High Sierra with Python 3.6.2, you'll need to ensure that `pip3` is correctly installed and accessible. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to troubleshoot and resolve your issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Homebrew is Up-to-Date:**\n   First, update Homebrew to make sure you have the latest package information:\n   ```bash\n   brew update\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Python3 via Homebrew:**\n   You might not have the right version of Python3 installed. To install or reinstall Python3 using Homebrew, run:\n   ```bash\n   brew install python\n   ```\n   This will install the latest Python 3 version, which includes `pip3`.\n\n3. **Verify Installation:**\n   After installation, verify that both `python3` and `pip3` are correctly installed:\n   ```bash\n   python3 --version\n   pip3 --version\n   ```\n   Both commands should return version numbers without errors.\n\n4. **Reinstall pip3:**\n   In case `pip3` is still not found, you can use Python\u2019s `ensurepip` module to install it:\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade\n   ```\n   Alternatively, you can install `pip3` using the `get-pip.py` script:\n   ```bash\n   curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py\n   python3 get-pip.py\n   ```\n\n5. **Install TensorFlow:**\n   Once `pip3` is available, you can install TensorFlow. As the `$TF_BINARY_URL` environment variable is deprecated, use the following command to install a specific version or the latest stable version:\n   ```bash\n   pip3 install tensorflow==1.12.0  # Adjust the version if needed\n   ```\n\n6. **Verify TensorFlow Installation:**\n   To verify that TensorFlow is correctly installed, open a Python 3 shell and try importing TensorFlow:\n   ```python\n   python3\n   >>> import tensorflow as tf\n   >>> print(tf.__version__)\n   ```\n   This should print the version of TensorFlow you installed.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and install TensorFlow on your macOS High Sierra system. If you encounter further errors, please provide the error messages for additional assistance."
