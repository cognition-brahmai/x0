I've found that f-strings are calculated even when the logging level is above the line that is being logged. I want to understand if using `%s` is the best and most modern approach for logging in Python 3.7. Consider the example code provided: \n\n```python\nimport logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\nlogger = logging.getLogger('MyLogger')\n\nclass MyClass:\n    def __init__(self, name: str) -> None:\n        self._name = name\n    def __str__(self) -> str:\n        print('GENERATING STRING')\n        return self._name\n\nc = MyClass('foo')\nlogger.debug(f'Created: {c}')\n```\nWhen this example is run, \"GENERATING STRING\" is printed to the screen, which indicates that the `__str__` method is being run even though my logging level is set to `INFO` and the log line is for `DEBUG`. The solution I've come across is to use `logger.debug('Created: %s', c)` instead of the f-string. However, I have a lot of code to update. I want to know if there's a more modern way to approach this logging problem and align with best practices."

        "content": "Yes, you're correct in observing that when using f-strings in logging, the expressions inside the f-strings are evaluated regardless of the logging level. This can lead to unnecessary computation, especially when the message won't be logged due to the current logging level. This is a known limitation when using f-strings directly in logging.\n\nThe approach you mentioned, `logger.debug('Created: %s', c)`, is indeed the recommended way to handle logging when performance is a concern, especially in scenarios where you want to avoid the overhead of string interpolation for log messages that may not be emitted. This approach delays the evaluation of the `__str__` method until it's certain that the message will be logged, which aligns with best practices in Python logging.\n\nHowever, if updating all the log statements in your codebase is a concern, you might consider the following strategies to make the transition easier:\n\n1. **Create a Wrapper Function:** You can create a custom logging function that automatically uses the `%s` formatting approach. This allows you to abstract away the specifics of the logging call, making your code cleaner and easier to maintain.\n\n   ```python\n   def log_debug(logger, message, *args):\n       if logger.isEnabledFor(logging.DEBUG):\n           logger.debug(message, *args)\n   ```\n\n   Then use it like:\n\n   ```python\n   log_debug(logger, 'Created: %s', c)\n   ```\n\n2. **Search and Replace:** If feasible, use a search-and-replace tool or script to update the logging statements across your codebase. Tools like `sed`, `awk`, or Python scripts with regex can be useful for automating this task.\n\n3. **IDE Refactoring Tools:** Many modern IDEs have refactoring tools that can help you automate changes across a codebase. This might be especially useful if your logging calls are consistent in their format.\n\n4. **Code Linter or Formatter:** Consider using a linter or formatter customized to check for and suggest the `%s` formatting style for logging calls. This can help ensure consistency across your team and codebase.\n\nWhile `%s` formatting might seem less modern compared to f-strings, in the context of logging, it's the most efficient way to ensure that string interpolation only occurs when necessary. This is a practical trade-off between modern syntactic sugar and performance optimization in logging."
