I am able to use the following method to iterate over a text file:\n```python\nwith open(path, 'r') as file:\n    for line in file:\n        # handle the line\n```\nor alternatively,\n```python\nwith open(path, 'r') as file:\n    for line in iter(file.readline, ''):\n        # handle the line\n```\nThe above methods are documented in PEP 234. However, I've been unable to find a similar method for binary files. For a binary file, I've tried:\n```python\nwith open(path, 'rb') as file:\n    while True:\n        chunk = file.read(1024 * 64)\n        if not chunk:\n            break\n        # handle the chunk\n```\nand also attempted the same idiom as with text files:\n```python\ndef make_read(file, size):\n    def read():\n        return file.read(size)\n    return read\n\nwith open(path, 'rb') as file:\n    for chunk in iter(make_read(file, 1024 * 64), b''):\n        # handle the chunk\n```\nAre these the idiomatic ways to iterate over a binary file in Python?"

        "content": "Yes, the methods you've described for iterating over a binary file in Python are indeed idiomatic and commonly used. Let's break down the approaches you've mentioned:\n\n1. **Using a while loop with `file.read(size)`**:\n   ```python\n   with open(path, 'rb') as file:\n       while True:\n           chunk = file.read(1024 * 64)\n           if not chunk:\n               break\n           # handle the chunk\n   ```\n   This method is straightforward and efficient. It reads the file in chunks of a specified size (e.g., 64KB in your example), which is useful for processing large files without loading the entire file into memory. The loop continues until `file.read(size)` returns an empty bytes object, indicating the end of the file.\n\n2. **Using `iter` with a custom `read` function**:\n   ```python\n   def make_read(file, size):\n       def read():\n           return file.read(size)\n       return read\n\n   with open(path, 'rb') as file:\n       for chunk in iter(make_read(file, 1024 * 64), b''):\n           # handle the chunk\n   ```\n   This method is a bit more functional in style. By creating a custom read function with `make_read`, you can leverage `iter` to iterate over the file in chunks. The `iter` function is used here to repeatedly call `make_read(file, size)` until it returns an empty bytes object, `b''`, which signifies the end of the file.\n\nBoth methods are idiomatic in the sense that they are clear and efficient for processing binary files in chunks. The choice between these approaches can depend on your personal preference or specific requirements of your application. The first method might be considered more straightforward and is likely more common in practice, while the second provides a more functional programming style."
