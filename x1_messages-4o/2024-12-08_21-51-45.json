What question do you ask to identify the dialect-fluent species while keeping in mind that one species always lies and the other always tells the truth?"

You would ask each species the following question:\n\n\"If I were to ask you if you speak my dialect, what would you say?\"\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. If you ask the species that always tells the truth and they do speak your dialect, they will truthfully answer \"Yes.\"\n2. If you ask the species that always tells the truth and they do not speak your dialect, they will truthfully answer \"No.\"\n3. If you ask the species that always lies and they do speak your dialect, they would lie and say \"No.\"\n4. If you ask the species that always lies and they do not speak your dialect, they would lie and say \"Yes.\"\n\nThe key is that the species that speaks your dialect and always tells the truth will say \"Yes,\" and any other combination will result in a \"No.\" This allows you to identify the species that speaks your dialect."
