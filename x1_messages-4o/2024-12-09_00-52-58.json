The error and traceback are as follows:\n\n```python\n>>> from sklearn import svm\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<pyshell#17>\", line 1, in <module>\n    from sklearn import svm\n  File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\sklearn\\__init__.py\", line 16, in <module>\n    from . import check_build\nImportError: cannot import name check_build\n```\nI've looked at several solutions for this issue, but none seem to solve this particular error. How can I successfully import from sklearn without encountering this error?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, `ImportError: cannot import name check_build`, typically indicates an issue with the installation of scikit-learn or its dependencies. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this:\n\n1. **Check for Incomplete Installation**: Sometimes, the installation might be incomplete or corrupted. Try reinstalling scikit-learn:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall scikit-learn\n   pip install scikit-learn\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure that you have compatible versions of numpy and scipy installed. scikit-learn 0.11 is quite old, and there might be compatibility issues with the versions of numpy and scipy you have. Consider upgrading them:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade numpy scipy\n   ```\n\n3. **Upgrade scikit-learn**: If possible, consider upgrading to a more recent version of scikit-learn. However, note that Python 2.7 is no longer supported, and recent versions of scikit-learn require Python 3. You might consider upgrading your Python version to 3.6 or later if feasible.\n\n4. **Check for Build Issues**: The error might be related to a build issue. Try building scikit-learn from source:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --no-binary :all: scikit-learn\n   ```\n\n5. **Environment Isolation**: Consider using a virtual environment to ensure there are no conflicts with other installed packages:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install virtualenv\n   virtualenv sklearn-env\n   sklearn-env\\Scripts\\activate\n   pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn\n   ```\n\n6. **Check for Hidden Files**: Sometimes, old compiled files might cause issues. Ensure that there are no leftover `.pyc` or other related files in your `site-packages` directory that might be interfering with the import.\n\n7. **Alternative Installation**: If pip installations continue to cause issues, consider using a scientific Python distribution like Anaconda, which comes with pre-packaged versions of numpy, scipy, and scikit-learn:\n\n   - Download and install Anaconda: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#download-section)\n   - Create and activate an environment:\n     ```bash\n     conda create -n sklearn-env python=2.7\n     conda activate sklearn-env\n     conda install scikit-learn\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the import error. If these do not resolve the issue, please provide additional details about any error messages or behavior you encounter."
