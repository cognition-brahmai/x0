The DataFrame 'df' is structured as follows:\n\n```python\n   A   B    C\n0  3  40  100\n1  6  30  200\n```\n\nI want to implement a check such that if column \"A\" exists, then the operation `df['sum'] = df['A'] + df['C']` is performed. However, if column \"A\" doesn't exist, the operation `df['sum'] = df['B'] + df['C']` should be performed instead."

        "content": "To check if a certain column exists in a Pandas DataFrame and perform conditional operations based on its existence, you can use the `in` keyword to check if the column is in the DataFrame's columns. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {'A': [3, 6], 'B': [40, 30], 'C': [100, 200]}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Check if column \"A\" exists and perform operations accordingly\nif 'A' in df.columns:\n    df['sum'] = df['A'] + df['C']\nelse:\n    df['sum'] = df['B'] + df['C']\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThis script checks if column \"A\" exists in the DataFrame `df`. If it does, it creates a new column `sum` which is the sum of columns \"A\" and \"C\". If column \"A\" does not exist, it creates the `sum` column as the sum of columns \"B\" and \"C\"."
