        "content": "To find the sum of all even numbers in an array, you can follow this algorithm:\n\n1. **Initialize a Sum Variable:**\n   - Start by creating a variable, say `sum`, and initialize it to 0. This variable will hold the sum of all even numbers in the array.\n\n2. **Iterate Through the Array:**\n   - Use a loop to traverse each element in the array. Depending on the programming language you're using, this could be a `for`, `while`, or a `foreach` loop.\n\n3. **Check for Even Numbers:**\n   - Inside the loop, for each element, check if the number is even. A number is considered even if it is divisible by 2 with no remainder, i.e., `number % 2 == 0`.\n\n4. **Add Even Numbers to Sum:**\n   - If the number is even, add it to the `sum` variable.\n\n5. **Continue Until the End of the Array:**\n   - Continue this process until you have checked all elements in the array.\n\n6. **Return the Sum:**\n   - After the loop ends, the `sum` variable will contain the sum of all even numbers in the array.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple example in Python:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_even_numbers(array):\n    sum = 0\n    for number in array:\n        if number % 2 == 0:\n            sum += number\n    return sum\n\n# Example usage:\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nresult = sum_of_even_numbers(array)\nprint(\"Sum of even numbers:\", result)  # Output: Sum of even numbers: 12\n```\n\nThis algorithm efficiently calculates the sum of all even numbers in an array by iterating through each element only once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array."
