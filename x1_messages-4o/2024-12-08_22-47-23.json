You need 2 cups of diced carrots, 3/4 cup of quinoa, 1/2 cup of chopped onions, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 2 cloves of garlic, 2 cups of vegetable broth, and 1 teaspoon of cumin. \nTo make it more challenging, can you create a code that will output a JSON object with the keys \"carrots\", \"quinoa\", \"onions\", \"olive oil\", \"garlic\", \"vegetable broth\", and \"cumin\" and their respective quantities as values? This will help you keep track of your ingredients and make sure you have everything you need to make your special dish. Good luck!"

You can create a JSON object to keep track of your ingredients using the following code snippet in Python:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Create a dictionary with the ingredients and their quantities\ningredients = {\n    \"carrots\": \"2 cups\",\n    \"quinoa\": \"3/4 cup\",\n    \"onions\": \"1/2 cup\",\n    \"olive oil\": \"1 tablespoon\",\n    \"garlic\": \"2 cloves\",\n    \"vegetable broth\": \"2 cups\",\n    \"cumin\": \"1 teaspoon\"\n}\n\n# Convert the dictionary to a JSON object\ningredients_json = json.dumps(ingredients, indent=4)\n\n# Output the JSON object\nprint(ingredients_json)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output a JSON object with the specified ingredients and their quantities in a readable format."
