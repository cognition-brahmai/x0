For example:\n\n```python\ndictionary = { \n               'C1' : [10,20,30],\n               'C2' : [20,30,40]\n             }\n```\n\nI want to increment all the values in the list associated with the key 'C1' by 10. Using `dictionary.get('C1')` gives me access to this list, but how can I update the values directly in the dictionary?"

Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndictionary = {\n    'C1': [10, 20, 30],\n    'C2': [20, 30, 40]\n}\n\n# Access the list associated with the key 'C1'\nc1_values = dictionary.get('C1')\n\n# Increment each value by 10\nif c1_values is not None:\n    for i in range(len(c1_values)):\n        c1_values[i] += 10\n\n# The dictionary is now updated\nprint(dictionary)\n```\n\nThis code accesses the list associated with the key `'C1'`, iterates through each element, increments it by 10, and updates the dictionary in place. The dictionary will be updated as follows:\n\n```python\n{\n    'C1': [20, 30, 40],\n    'C2': [20, 30, 40]\n}\n```\n\nThis approach directly modifies the list in the dictionary because lists are mutable objects in Python."
