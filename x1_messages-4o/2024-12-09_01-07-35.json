I am seeking a magic method that can overload the assignment operator, something similar to '__assign__(self, new_value)'. I want to restrict re-binding for an instance. Here's an example of what I'm trying to accomplish:\n\n```python\nclass Protect():\n  def __assign__(self, value):\n    raise Exception(\"This is an ex-parrot\")\n\nvar = Protect()  # once assigned...\nvar = 1          # this should raise Exception()\n```\n\nIs this a possible task? Is this idea too far-fetched?"

        "content": "In Python, you cannot directly overload the assignment operator (`=`) like you can with some other operators. This is because assignment in Python is a fundamental part of the language's syntax and not an operator that can be overloaded. When you do `var = 1`, you're not calling a method on an object; you're simply rebinding the name `var` to a new object.\n\nHowever, there are ways to achieve similar behavior by using properties, descriptors, or custom classes to control how attributes are set. Here\u2019s a way you can restrict rebinding using a custom class:\n\n```python\nclass Protect:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._value = None\n        self._assigned = False\n\n    def __setattr__(self, name, value):\n        if name == '_value' and self._assigned:\n            raise Exception(\"This is an ex-parrot\")\n        else:\n            super().__setattr__(name, value)\n            if name == '_value':\n                self._assigned = True\n\n    @property\n    def value(self):\n        return self._value\n\n    @value.setter\n    def value(self, new_value):\n        raise Exception(\"This is an ex-parrot\")\n\n# Usage\nvar = Protect()\nvar._value = 42  # Assigning first time\nprint(var.value) # Accessing the value\n\nvar._value = 1   # This will raise an exception\n```\n\nIn this example, I've created a `Protect` class that uses `__setattr__` to control attribute assignment. The first time you set `_value`, it works fine, but any subsequent attempt to assign to `_value` will raise an exception.\n\nThis doesn't prevent rebinding the `var` name itself (e.g., `var = 1`), but it does protect the internal state of the `Protect` instance from being changed once set. Rebinding a variable name is a separate issue and is a fundamental behavior in Python that cannot be overridden."
