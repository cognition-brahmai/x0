        "content": "I'm trying to learn Django and am currently trying to handle a simple GET variable from the URL \"site.com/search/?q=search-term\". I have created a view to handle this, but I am facing issues checking if the 'q' variable is None. The search queries like \"mysite.com/search/?\" (without q) get through the first if correctly. However, queries like \"mysite.com/search/?q=\" are not getting caught by the condition \"if q is not None:\". How can I correctly check if 'q' is None? I have already tried comparing it with '' and None, but none of these attempts were successful. Here's the code snippet I'm working with:\n\n```python\ndef search(request):\n    if request.method == 'GET' and 'q' in request.GET:\n        q = request.GET.get('q', None)\n        if q is not None:\n            results = Task.objects.filter(\n                                   Q(title__contains=q)\n                                   |\n                                   Q(description__contains=q),\n                                   )\n            ...return...\n        else:\n            ...\n    else:\n        ...\n```"

        "content": "In Django, when you retrieve a query parameter using `request.GET.get('q', None)`, it will return an empty string (`''`) if the parameter `q` is present in the URL but has no value (like in \"site.com/search/?q=\"). This is why your check for `None` is not working as expected. Instead, you should check for an empty string.\n\nYou can modify your condition to check if `q` is not an empty string by using:\n\n```python\ndef search(request):\n    if request.method == 'GET' and 'q' in request.GET:\n        q = request.GET.get('q', None)\n        if q:  # This will check if q is not an empty string or None\n            results = Task.objects.filter(\n                Q(title__contains=q) |\n                Q(description__contains=q)\n            )\n            # Return your results here\n            ...\n        else:\n            # Handle the case where q is an empty string\n            ...\n    else:\n        # Handle the case where q is not in request.GET\n        ...\n```\n\nIn Python, an empty string evaluates to `False`, so using `if q:` will cover both the cases where `q` is `None` or an empty string. This should solve your problem and allow you to handle the cases where `q` is not provided or is provided but empty."
