However, I've noticed that Python 3 doesn't have a function like `raw_input`. The `input` function does not allow the user to input lines separated by a newline (Enter) and it only prints back the first line. Is there a way to store multiline inputs in a variable or read it to a list?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can handle multiline input in Python using a loop or by reading until a specific condition is met. Here are a couple of ways to do this:\n\n### Method 1: Using a Loop to Collect Lines\n\nYou can use a loop to collect multiple lines of input and store them in a list. This approach will keep collecting input until a specific condition is met (e.g., an empty line is entered):\n\n```python\nlines = []\nprint(\"Enter your text (end with an empty line):\")\n\nwhile True:\n    line = input()\n    if line == \"\":\n        break\n    lines.append(line)\n\n# Now `lines` contains all the input lines\nfor i, line in enumerate(lines, start=1):\n    print(f\"Line {i}: {line}\")\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using `sys.stdin.read`\n\nIf you want to let the user input multiple lines and then work with them after input is complete, you can use `sys.stdin.read()`. This method is useful when you have a specific end-of-input indicator or when you want the user to signal the end of input (e.g., with `Ctrl+D` on Unix/Linux or `Ctrl+Z` on Windows).\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nprint(\"Enter your text (press Ctrl+D or Ctrl+Z to end):\")\ninput_text = sys.stdin.read()\n\n# Split the input into lines\nlines = input_text.splitlines()\n\n# Now `lines` contains all the input lines\nfor i, line in enumerate(lines, start=1):\n    print(f\"Line {i}: {line}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Method 1**: This method uses a loop to keep asking for input until the user provides an empty line. Each line is appended to the `lines` list.\n  \n- **Method 2**: This method reads all input until an EOF (End Of File) signal is received (user presses `Ctrl+D` or `Ctrl+Z`). The input is then split into lines using `splitlines()`.\n\nYou can choose the method that best fits your use case."
