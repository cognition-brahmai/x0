        "content": "To extract emojis from a string, you can use the `emoji` library in Python, which has built-in functionality for dealing with emojis. If you don't have this library installed, you can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install emoji\n```\n\nOnce you have the library installed, you can use it to extract emojis from your list. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport emoji\n\n# Define your list\na_list = ['  me as\u00ed, bla es se  ds ']\n\n# Initialize the new list\nnew_lis = []\n\n# Function to extract emojis from a string\ndef extract_emojis(text):\n    return [char for char in text if char in emoji.UNICODE_EMOJI['en']]\n\n# Iterate through each element in a_list and extract emojis\nfor item in a_list:\n    emojis = extract_emojis(item)\n    new_lis.extend(emojis)\n\nprint(new_lis)\n```\n\nThe `emoji.UNICODE_EMOJI['en']` dictionary provides a comprehensive list of emoji characters that you can use to check against each character in your string. This method will efficiently extract all emojis and store them in the `new_lis`."
