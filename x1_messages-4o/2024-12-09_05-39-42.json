        "content": "The error you're encountering, `TypeError: object() takes no parameters`, typically arises when you try to instantiate a class that is not properly defined with respect to handling parameters, or when the class you're trying to instantiate is not properly imported or referenced.\n\nHere's how you can troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Imports and Namespacing**:\n   - Ensure that `Experiences`, `Places`, and `Countries` modules are correctly imported and that they contain the expected classes and types.\n   \n2. **Verify Class Definitions**:\n   - Ensure that `Experiences.ttypes.Experience`, `Experiences.ttypes.DateTimeInterval`, `Places.ttypes.Address`, and `Places.ttypes.Location` are correctly defined and imported. The error suggests that one of these might be an `object` or similar simple type, not a class that accepts parameters.\n\n3. **Debugging the Instantiation**:\n   - You are constructing several objects with `Experiences.ttypes.DateTimeInterval`, `Places.ttypes.Address`, and `Experiences.ttypes.Experience`. Double-check that these objects can be instantiated with the parameters you're providing.\n\n4. **Review the Error Context**:\n   - The error occurs when you are trying to create an `Experience` object. Ensure that `Experiences.ttypes.Experience` is a class that accepts keyword arguments (`**exp_dict`). If it's not, redefine the constructor correctly.\n\n5. **Check for Misleading Names**:\n   - Ensure that there are no naming conflicts or redefinitions of the classes you are trying to instantiate. Sometimes, variables or functions might be inadvertently named the same as the class, leading to such errors.\n\n6. **Inspect the `exp_dict` Structure**:\n   - Make sure that the `exp_dict` contains all the necessary keys and values expected by the `Experiences.ttypes.Experience` constructor.\n\n7. **Potential Issue with `Geocoder.geocode`**:\n   - If `Geocoder` is not properly defined or imported, it could also lead to unexpected behavior. Ensure this is correctly set up and returns the expected format.\n\nGiven these points, you need to go through the definitions of the classes and methods involved to ensure they are correctly set up to handle the parameters you are passing. Double-check the imports and the structure of the `exp_dict` to ensure it aligns with the expected constructor inputs."
