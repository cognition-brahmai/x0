I've noticed that when I try to use `continue` inside a `finally` clause, it results in a syntax error. Here is the code that I attempted:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(10):\n    print i\n    try:\n       pass\n    finally:\n       continue\n    print i\n```\n\nHowever, this resulted in the following syntax error:\n```\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 6\nSyntaxError: 'continue' not supported inside 'finally' clause\n```\n\nWhy isn't a `continue` statement allowed inside a `finally` clause? On the other hand, if I use a `break` statement instead of `continue`, it seems to work fine. Here is the code that works:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(10):\n    print i\n    try:\n       pass\n    finally:\n       break\n```\n\nI am currently using Python 2.6.6."

        "content": "The reason why the `continue` statement is not allowed inside a `finally` clause in Python is due to the control flow complexities that arise from combining `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks with loop control statements like `continue`.\n\nThe `finally` block is intended to be a place where cleanup code is executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred. The Python interpreter expects the `finally` block to complete its execution before the loop's control flow can proceed. If `continue` were allowed in a `finally` block, it would cause ambiguity in control flow because `continue` would attempt to move the loop to the next iteration before the `finally` block has completed its execution. This goes against the expectation that the `finally` block must complete before any other operations, including loop control changes, can occur.\n\nOn the other hand, using a `break` statement inside a `finally` block is allowed because `break` explicitly terminates the loop, which doesn't create a conflict with the expectation of the `finally` block completing its execution.\n\nIf you need to use `continue` and ensure that cleanup happens, you should structure your code such that the `continue` statement is outside the `finally` block. Here's an example to achieve similar logic:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(10):\n    print i\n    try:\n        pass\n    finally:\n        # Perform any necessary cleanup here\n        print(\"Cleanup in finally block\")\n    # Now you can place continue safely outside the finally block\n    continue\n    print i  # This will not be reached because of the continue\n```\n\nThis way, the `continue` is outside the `finally` block, avoiding the syntax error while still allowing the `finally` block to execute its cleanup code."
