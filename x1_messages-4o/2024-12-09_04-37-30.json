        "content": "Certainly! In Python, `__str__` and `__repr__` are special methods used to define how objects of a class are represented as strings. They serve different purposes and are used in different contexts, though they both aim to provide a human-readable text representation of an object.\n\n### `__str__`\n\n- **Purpose**: The `__str__` method is used to define a \"nice\" or \"informal\" string representation of an object, which is meant to be readable and user-friendly.\n- **Usage**: This method is called by the `str()` function and by the `print()` function when you print an object. It is designed to provide a string that is useful for end-users, giving them a clear and concise description of the object.\n- **Example**: If you have a class `Car` with attributes like `make` and `model`, you might implement `__str__` to return a string like \"Toyota Camry\" to make it easy for users to understand the object.\n\n```python\nclass Car:\n    def __init__(self, make, model):\n        self.make = make\n        self.model = model\n        \n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"{self.make} {self.model}\"\n\ncar = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\")\nprint(car)  # Output: Toyota Camry\n```\n\n### `__repr__`\n\n- **Purpose**: The `__repr__` method is meant to provide an \"official\" string representation of an object. The goal is to be unambiguous and, if possible, to provide a string that could be used to recreate the object.\n- **Usage**: This method is called by the `repr()` function and in the interactive interpreter when you inspect an object directly. It is primarily used for debugging and development, giving developers a detailed view of the object.\n- **Example**: Continuing with the `Car` class, you might implement `__repr__` to return something like \"Car(make='Toyota', model='Camry')\" to give a clear and detailed representation.\n\n```python\nclass Car:\n    def __init__(self, make, model):\n        self.make = make\n        self.model = model\n        \n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"Car(make='{self.make}', model='{self.model}')\"\n\ncar = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\")\nprint(repr(car))  # Output: Car(make='Toyota', model='Camry')\n```\n\n### Key Differences\n\n- `__str__` is for creating output for end-users, while `__repr__` is generally for developers.\n- If only `__repr__` is defined, and `__str__` is not, Python will fall back on `__repr__` when `str()` or `print()` is used.\n- Ideally, `__repr__` should return a string that could be used to recreate the object (though this is not always feasible), while `__str__` should be more user-friendly.\n\nIn practice, you would use `__str__` when you want to provide a simple and clear output for general display and `__repr__` when you need a detailed output for debugging or logging."
