        "content": "An AI, or any algorithm, can determine if a given matrix is symmetric by checking if the matrix is equal to its transpose. A matrix \\( A \\) is symmetric if \\( A = A^T \\). Here's a step-by-step approach to determine if a matrix is symmetric:\n\n1. **Check if the matrix is square**: A symmetric matrix must be square, meaning it has the same number of rows and columns. If the matrix is not square, it cannot be symmetric.\n\n2. **Compute the transpose of the matrix**: The transpose of a matrix is obtained by flipping it over its diagonal. For a matrix \\( A \\), the element at the \\( i^{th} \\) row and \\( j^{th} \\) column in the transpose \\( A^T \\) will be the element at the \\( j^{th} \\) row and \\( i^{th} \\) column in the original matrix.\n\n3. **Compare the original matrix with its transpose**: Check if each element in the original matrix \\( A \\) is equal to the corresponding element in the transposed matrix \\( A^T \\). If all corresponding elements are equal, then the matrix is symmetric.\n\nHere's a simple example in Python to check if a matrix is symmetric:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef is_symmetric(matrix):\n    # Convert the input to a numpy array\n    matrix = np.array(matrix)\n    \n    # Check if the matrix is square\n    if matrix.shape[0] != matrix.shape[1]:\n        return False\n    \n    # Compare the matrix with its transpose\n    return np.array_equal(matrix, matrix.T)\n\n# Example usage\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 2, 3],\n    [2, 4, 5],\n    [3, 5, 6]\n]\n\nprint(is_symmetric(matrix))  # Output: True\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `is_symmetric` takes a matrix as input and returns `True` if the matrix is symmetric and `False` otherwise. Note that using libraries like NumPy can make operations on matrices more efficient and easier to implement."
