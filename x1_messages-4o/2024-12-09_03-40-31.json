        "content": "Is there an efficient way in Numpy to retrieve the integer indices of locations in an array where a certain condition is true, as opposed to getting the Boolean mask array? For instance, if we have an array 'x' and a mask that finds all values that are a power of 2 in 'x', how can we get the indices 'i' of 'mask' where 'mask[i]' is True, without using a loop? Here is the code illustrating the scenario:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nx = np.array([range(100, 1, -1)])\n# generate a mask to find all values that are a power of 2\nmask = x & (x - 1) == 0\n# This will tell me those values\nprint(x[mask])\n```"

        "content": "Yes, you can efficiently retrieve the integer indices of locations in a NumPy array where a certain condition is true using the `np.where` function. This function returns the indices of the elements that satisfy the condition, without the need for a loop. Here's how you can apply it to your scenario:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nx = np.array(range(100, 1, -1))\n# generate a mask to find all values that are a power of 2\nmask = (x & (x - 1)) == 0\n# This will give you the indices where the condition is True\nindices = np.where(mask)[0]\n\n# Print the indices\nprint(indices)\n\n# Verify by printing the values at those indices\nprint(x[indices])\n```\n\nIn this code, `np.where(mask)[0]` returns the indices of the array `x` where the condition specified in `mask` is true. This way, you get the integer indices directly, and you can use them to access or manipulate the elements of `x` that meet the condition."
