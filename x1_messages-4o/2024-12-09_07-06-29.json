The old non-GPU version compiles perfectly fine with mingw in Windows, and I was hoping I could do the same with the CUDA version. We've been trying to compile kernel code with nvcc in Visual Studio and the rest with gcc in mingw. We've managed to compile the .cu file in Visual Studio but we're unable to compile the C code in mingw. The C code contains CUDA API calls such as `cudaMalloc` and CUDA types like `cudaEvent_t` which means we must include `cuda.h` and `cuda_runtime.h`. However, gcc issues warnings and errors for these headers, as shown below:\n\n```\n../include/host_defines.h:57:0: warning: \"__cdecl\" redefined\n../include/vector_functions.h:127:14: error: 'short_4' has no member named 'x'\n```\n\nHow can we include these headers and compile the C portion of the code without any errors?"

        "content": "Compiling a CUDA application that involves both CUDA and non-CUDA code across different compilers (such as Visual Studio's NVCC and MinGW's GCC) can be challenging due to differences in how these compilers handle certain constructs. Here are several strategies you can pursue to resolve the issues you're encountering:\n\n1. **Use NVCC for All Compilation:**\n   - Since you're using CUDA API and data types in your C code, consider compiling all your C/C++ code with NVCC instead of mixing compilers. NVCC can compile both CUDA and host code, and it might simplify your build process by avoiding the cross-compiler compatibility issues.\n\n2. **Wrapper Functions:**\n   - If you must use GCC for the non-CUDA code, you can create a set of wrapper functions in a separate CUDA-compatible C++ file. This file should handle all CUDA API calls and data types. You can then compile this file with NVCC and link the resulting object file with your GCC-compiled code.\n\n3. **Separate Compilation Units:**\n   - Separate CUDA-related code and general C code into different files. Compile the CUDA files with NVCC and the C files with GCC. Ensure that the CUDA headers are only included in files compiled with NVCC to avoid compatibility issues with GCC.\n\n4. **Use CMake:**\n   - Use CMake with the appropriate toolchain files to manage the build process. CMake can help streamline the building of projects across different compilers and platforms, and it can properly configure NVCC and GCC to work together.\n\n5. **Cross-Compilation:**\n   - Consider setting up a cross-compilation environment where you compile the entire project for Windows from a Linux environment. This can sometimes be easier than mixing compilers on Windows.\n\n6. **Address Specific Errors:**\n   - For errors like `__cdecl` redefinition, ensure that the proper macros and compiler-specific flags are set. This might involve configuring preprocessor macros or using compiler flags that align with how NVCC handles them.\n\n7. **MinGW Compatibility:**\n   - Ensure that your MinGW installation is up to date and compatible with the CUDA toolkit version you're using. Check for any known issues or patches that might be needed.\n\n8. **Conditional Compilation:**\n   - Use preprocessor directives to conditionally include headers or code sections based on the compiler being used. This can help prevent incompatible sections from being compiled by the wrong compiler.\n\nBy taking one or more of these approaches, you should be able to compile your CUDA-enabled application successfully."
