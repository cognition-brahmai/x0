When I set the PATH to point to CUDA 9.2 and run `which nvcc`, the output shows `/usr/local/cuda-9.2/bin/nvcc`, indicating it's using CUDA 9.2. But when I run `nvidia-smi`, the CUDA version shown is 10.0. I'm confused about which version of CUDA I'm actually using. I have referred to this answer on Stack Overflow but it does not clarify my confusion and just suggests reinstalling the CUDA Toolkit, which I have already done. So am I using CUDA 9.2 as suggested by `which nvcc` or CUDA 10 as suggested by `nvidia-smi`?"

        "content": "The confusion you're experiencing is due to the difference between the CUDA toolkit version and the driver version. Here's a breakdown to clarify:\n\n1. **nvcc and PATH**: \n   - The `nvcc` command is the CUDA compiler driver, and its version is determined by the CUDA toolkit whose path is set in your environment variables. Since `which nvcc` points to `/usr/local/cuda-9.2/bin/nvcc`, it means that your system is set up to use the CUDA 9.2 toolkit for compiling CUDA code.\n\n2. **nvidia-smi**:\n   - The `nvidia-smi` command is part of the NVIDIA driver package. It reports the version of the CUDA driver (runtime) that is installed with the NVIDIA drivers. This version can be different from the toolkit version, and it typically shows the latest version that the driver supports. In your case, `nvidia-smi` showing CUDA 10.0 indicates that your NVIDIA driver supports CUDA 10.0.\n\n3. **What are you actually using?**\n   - When you compile programs, you are using CUDA 9.2 because that's what your `nvcc` points to. However, when you run programs, they are executed using the driver, which supports CUDA 10.0. This setup is generally not problematic as CUDA is designed to be backward compatible, meaning that the driver can support applications built with older versions of the CUDA toolkit.\n\n4. **Ensuring Consistency**:\n   - If you want to ensure consistency between the toolkit and the runtime, you can either update your CUDA toolkit to match the driver version (CUDA 10.0) or, if you specifically need to use CUDA 9.2 features, ensure that your libraries and applications are compatible with the CUDA 9.2 toolkit.\n\nIn conclusion, you're compiling with CUDA 9.2, but running with a driver that supports up to CUDA 10.0. This is generally fine unless there are specific features or compatibility issues you need to address."
