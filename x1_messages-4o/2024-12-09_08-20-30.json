Is there a better way to print 'F' if the `isfemale_bit` is true, and 'M' otherwise, possibly similar to the ternary operator `a?b:c` in other languages? The closest I have gotten is `print ['M', 'F'][int(isfemale_bit)]`.\n\n```python\nif isfemale_bit:\n    print 'F'\nelse:\n    print 'M'\n```"

You can use this concise form:\n\n```python\nprint('F' if isfemale_bit else 'M')\n```\n\nThis single line uses Python's conditional expression, which is a more readable and compact way to handle simple conditional logic compared to the traditional if-else block. It checks if `isfemale_bit` is true; if so, it prints 'F', and if not, it prints 'M'."
