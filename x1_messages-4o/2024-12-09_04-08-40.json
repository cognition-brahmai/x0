I am currently using a script that reads lines from a text file and prints them out with a comma separating each line. However, each line is being printed on a new line, and I can't figure out how to print all the lines on the same line. \n\nHere's my current list:\n\n```\nCat\nDog\nMonkey\nPig\n```\n\nHere's my current script:\n\n```python\nimport sys\ninput_file = open('list.txt', 'r')\nfor line in input_file:\n    sys.stdout.write('\"' + line + '\",')\n```\n\nThe output I'm getting is:\n\n```python\n\"Cat\n\",\"Dog\n\",\"Monkey\n\",\"Pig\",\n```\n\nBut what I'd like is:\n\n```python\n\"Cat\",\"Dog\",\"Monkey\",\"Pig\",\n```\n\nAdditionally, I'd like to remove the trailing comma at the end of the last item. How can I modify my script to achieve this?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired output, you need to remove the newline characters from each line and handle the trailing comma issue. You can use the `strip()` method to remove unwanted whitespace, including newline characters, and then join the lines with a comma. Here's how you can modify your script:\n\n```python\n# Open the input file for reading\nwith open('list.txt', 'r') as input_file:\n    # Read all lines from the file and strip out newline characters\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in input_file]\n\n# Join the lines with a comma and wrap each line with quotes\noutput = ','.join(f'\"{line}\"' for line in lines)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(output)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`with open('list.txt', 'r') as input_file:`**: This ensures that the file is properly closed after reading.\n\n2. **`lines = [line.strip() for line in input_file]`**: This list comprehension reads each line from the file and removes any leading or trailing whitespace, including newline characters.\n\n3. **`','.join(f'\"{line}\"' for line in lines)`**: This joins all the lines into a single string, each wrapped in quotes and separated by commas.\n\n4. **`print(output)`**: This prints the final result in the desired format.\n\nBy following this approach, you will not only eliminate the carriage returns but also remove the trailing comma after the last item."
