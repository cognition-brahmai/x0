        "content": "I have created a Python program to solve Project Euler's Problem 10. The program contains three functions: `isPrime` checks if a number is prime, `primeList` generates a list of prime numbers up to a given limit, and `sumPrimes` sums up the numbers in the prime list. The program works fine, but to better understand recursion, I rewrote `primeList` as a recursive function `primeListRec`. However, when I run `primeListRec` with a large number such as 1000 or 2000, my program crashes and I receive a \"RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded\". What is wrong with my recursive function and how can I avoid the recursion limit in Python?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded,\" is common when a recursive function calls itself too many times without hitting a base case or when the recursion limit in Python is reached. Python has a default recursion limit, which is set to prevent infinite recursions and potential crashes. You can check this limit with `sys.getrecursionlimit()` and change it with `sys.setrecursionlimit()`, but increasing the limit is generally not recommended for solving this type of problem due to potential memory issues or stack overflow.\n\nInstead, consider the following approaches:\n\n1. **Optimize the Recursive Function:**\n   - Ensure that your recursive function has a clear base case and is optimized to reduce unnecessary recursive calls.\n\n2. **Convert to Iterative:**\n   - For generating prime numbers, an iterative approach is often more efficient and avoids recursion depth issues. Using a loop will handle larger numbers without the risk of hitting recursion limits.\n\n3. **Use a Different Algorithm:**\n   - Consider using the Sieve of Eratosthenes, an efficient algorithm to generate all primes up to a given limit. It's iterative and works well for larger numbers.\n\nHere's an example of how you might implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes iteratively:\n\n```python\ndef sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit):\n    primes = []\n    is_prime = [True] * (limit + 1)\n    for num in range(2, limit + 1):\n        if is_prime[num]:\n            primes.append(num)\n            for multiple in range(num * num, limit + 1, num):\n                is_prime[multiple] = False\n    return primes\n\ndef sumPrimes(limit):\n    primes = sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit)\n    return sum(primes)\n\nprint(sumPrimes(2000))  # This should work for larger numbers without recursion issues\n```\n\nBy using an iterative approach or a more efficient algorithm, you can avoid recursion depth issues and optimize your program's performance for larger inputs."
