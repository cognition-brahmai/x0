        "content": "To read a file that is located inside your Python package, you can make use of the `importlib.resources` module available in Python 3.7 and later versions. This module provides a convenient and safe way to access files within packages. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Using `importlib.resources`\n\n1. **Ensure your package structure is correct**: \n   ```\n   package/\n       __init__.py\n       templates/\n           __init__.py\n           temp_file\n   ```\n\n2. **Read the file using `importlib.resources`**:\n   ```python\n   import importlib.resources\n\n   # Assuming 'package' is the name of your package and 'templates' is the directory\n   with importlib.resources.open_text('package.templates', 'temp_file') as file:\n       content = file.read()\n\n   print(content)\n   ```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `importlib.resources.open_text(package, resource)` is used to open a file from a specified package. It returns a file-like object in text mode.\n- `'package.templates'` is the package and sub-package (or directory) path.\n- `'temp_file'` is the name of the file you want to read.\n\n### Alternative Approach for Older Versions:\n\nIf you're using a version of Python older than 3.7, you can use `pkgutil` or `pkg_resources` from the `setuptools` package, although they are not as straightforward as `importlib.resources`.\n\n#### Using `pkgutil`:\n```python\nimport pkgutil\n\ndata = pkgutil.get_data('package.templates', 'temp_file')\ncontent = data.decode('utf-8')  # Decode bytes to string\nprint(content)\n```\n\n#### Using `pkg_resources`:\n```python\nimport pkg_resources\n\ndata = pkg_resources.resource_string('package.templates', 'temp_file')\ncontent = data.decode('utf-8')  # Decode bytes to string\nprint(content)\n```\n\n### Note:\n- Ensure that your package is properly structured and that you have `__init__.py` files where necessary to mark directories as packages.\n- Make sure the file you want to read is included in your package's distribution (e.g., if you're using `setuptools`, ensure it's included in `MANIFEST.in`).\n\nThese methods will help you access files within your package without worrying about the absolute file paths, making your code more portable and easier to maintain."
