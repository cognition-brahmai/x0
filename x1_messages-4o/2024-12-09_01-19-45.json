In the worst-case scenario, \\( k \\) can be equal to \\( N \\), making the complexity \\( O(N) \\).\n\nWhen slicing a list in Python, a new list is created that contains references to the elements from the original list from index \\( i_1 \\) to \\( i_2 \\). This is done through a process that iterates over the specified range and copies the references to the new list. Therefore, the time complexity is proportional to the number of elements in the slice, \\( k \\).\n\nYour understanding is correct that if you were to implement a slicer by iterating from \\( i_1 \\) to \\( i_2 \\) and collecting elements into a new list, the complexity would be \\( O(k) \\), which is consistent with how Python handles list slicing."
