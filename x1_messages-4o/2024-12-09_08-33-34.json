        "content": "To print Unicode characters in Python and store them in variables, you can use Unicode strings. In Python 3, strings are Unicode by default, which makes it straightforward to work with Unicode characters.\n\nHere's how you can print Unicode characters and store them in variables:\n\n### Printing Unicode Characters\n\nTo print Unicode characters, you can simply include them directly in your string, or you can use Unicode escape sequences.\n\n```python\n# Directly including Unicode characters\nprint(\"Hello, world! \ud83c\udf0d\")\n\n# Using Unicode escape sequences\nprint(\"Hello, world! \\u263A\")  # Smiley face\n```\n\n### Storing Unicode Characters in Variables\n\nYou can store Unicode characters in variables by assigning them directly to a string variable:\n\n```python\n# Directly assigning Unicode characters\ngreeting = \"Hello, world! \ud83c\udf0d\"\n\n# Using Unicode escape sequences\nsmiley = \"\\u263A\"\n```\n\n### Creating a Dictionary with Unicode Characters\n\nTo create a dictionary where English words point to their translations in Russian and French, you can use Unicode strings for the translations:\n\n```python\ntranslations = {\n    \"hello\": {\n        \"russian\": \"\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442\",\n        \"french\": \"bonjour\"\n    },\n    \"world\": {\n        \"russian\": \"\u043c\u0438\u0440\",\n        \"french\": \"monde\"\n    }\n}\n\n# Accessing translations\nprint(\"Hello in Russian:\", translations[\"hello\"][\"russian\"])\nprint(\"World in French:\", translations[\"world\"][\"french\"])\n```\n\nThis code creates a dictionary where the keys are English words, and the values are dictionaries containing the translations in Russian and French. You can access the translations using the appropriate keys."
