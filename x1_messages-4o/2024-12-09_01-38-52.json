I'm using SOCKS5 from Terminal to bypass this issue but it's causing me to get a \"Missing dependencies for SOCKS support\" error in Python's requests. I am also not able to solve this issue by using PySocks and urllib3 with Socks. I'm also facing a \"Max retries exceeded\" error with the url when I try to use pip install requests[socks]. What can be the possible workaround for this?"

        "content": "It sounds like you're facing a couple of challenges: setting up SOCKS5 support for the `requests` library in Python and dealing with network restrictions. Here's a step-by-step guide to help resolve these issues:\n\n1. **Install Required Packages:**\n   Ensure you have the necessary packages installed. Since you're using Python 2.7, make sure you have the correct versions of the packages. You will need `requests`, `PySocks`, and `urllib3`. \n\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests==2.22.0  # or the latest version compatible with Python 2.7\n   pip install PySocks==1.7.1\n   pip install urllib3==1.25.11  # or the latest version compatible with Python 2.7\n   ```\n\n2. **Use a Proxy with Requests:**\n   To use a SOCKS5 proxy with the `requests` library, you'll typically set up the proxy like so:\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n   import socks\n   import socket\n\n   # Set up SOCKS5 proxy\n   socks.set_default_proxy(socks.SOCKS5, \"localhost\", 9050)  # Replace with your proxy host and port\n   socket.socket = socks.socksocket\n\n   # Now make a request\n   response = requests.get('http://example.com')\n   print(response.text)\n   ```\n\n3. **Handling Network Restrictions:**\n   If your network is blocking the remote address, using a proxy as you are attempting should help. Make sure that the SOCKS5 proxy server is running and accessible. You might want to check if it's properly configured and that there's no firewall or security software blocking it.\n\n4. **Max Retries Exceeded Error:**\n   This error typically occurs if the request cannot reach the server. Here are a few things to check:\n   - Ensure your proxy details are correct.\n   - Check your internet connection.\n   - Verify that the target server is up and accessible.\n   - Increase the timeout or number of retries in your request, if necessary.\n\n   ```python\n   from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter\n   from requests.packages.urllib3.util.retry import Retry\n\n   session = requests.Session()\n   retry = Retry(connect=5, backoff_factor=0.5)\n   adapter = HTTPAdapter(max_retries=retry)\n   session.mount('http://', adapter)\n   session.mount('https://', adapter)\n\n   response = session.get('http://example.com', timeout=10)  # Set timeout as needed\n   ```\n\n5. **Alternative Solutions:**\n   If the above steps don't resolve the issue or if you're still facing network restrictions, consider using a VPN to bypass network limitations. Alternatively, using a different network or contacting your network administrator for access might also be a solution.\n\n6. **Upgrade Python:**\n   If possible, consider upgrading to a newer version of Python, like Python 3. This will provide access to more up-to-date libraries and dependencies, which can make handling such issues easier.\n\nIf you continue to encounter problems, feel free to provide more details, and I can help troubleshoot further."
