        "content": "Challenge: Can you provide me with Swift code for 5 different physical activities I can incorporate into my daily routine? Each activity should be performed for a certain number of repetitions or duration, and the code should calculate the total number of repetitions or duration for the day. Here are the activities: \n1. Jumping jacks - perform 20 repetitions\n2. Squats - perform 10 repetitions\n3. Push-ups - perform 5 repetitions\n4. Plank - hold for 30 seconds\n5. Lunges - perform 10 repetitions for each leg \nBonus challenge: Can you modify the code to create a randomized workout plan each day, selecting a different set of 5 activities from a list of 10 possible activities? The code should also track progress over time and suggest modifications to the workout plan based on the user's fitness level."

Below is a Swift code that incorporates the activities you've mentioned, calculates the total number of repetitions or duration for the day, and includes a bonus feature to randomize the workout plan from a list of 10 activities.
