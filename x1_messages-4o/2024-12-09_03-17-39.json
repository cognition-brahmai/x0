Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\n1. **Import NumPy**: First, ensure that you have NumPy installed and then import it.\n\n   ```python\n   import numpy as np\n   ```\n\n2. **Create or have your NumPy array ready**: For demonstration, let's create a sample NumPy array.\n\n   ```python\n   array = np.array([[1.5, 2.3, 3.9],\n                     [4.1, 5.6, 6.2],\n                     [7.7, 8.4, 9.0]])\n   ```\n\n3. **Use `numpy.savetxt` to export the array**: Use the `numpy.savetxt` function to write the array to a CSV file.\n\n   ```python\n   np.savetxt(\"output.csv\", array, delimiter=\",\", fmt=\"%.2f\")\n   ```\n\n   - `\"output.csv\"`: The name of the file where you want to save the array.\n   - `array`: The NumPy array you want to export.\n   - `delimiter=\",\"`: Specifies that the delimiter between elements should be a comma, which is standard for CSV files.\n   - `fmt=\"%.2f\"`: This specifies the format for the numbers. Here, `%.2f` formats the numbers to two decimal places. You can adjust this format as needed.\n\n4. **Check the CSV file**: After running the above code, a file named `output.csv` will be created in your working directory. Open this file with a text editor or a spreadsheet application to see your data in a human-readable format.\n\nThis method ensures that your data is neatly formatted and easy to read when opened in a spreadsheet application like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets."
