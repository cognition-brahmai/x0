Let's assume this event is scheduled for December 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM. This mission could be aimed at exploring a new planet or testing groundbreaking technology, which holds potential for major advancements in space exploration and science.\n\nHere's how you can modify the countdown timer for this event:\n\n```html\n<span id=\"countdown\"></span>\n<script>\n// Set the date we're counting down to\nvar eventDate = new Date(\"December 15, 2023 10:00:00\").getTime();\n// Update the count down every 1 second\nvar x = setInterval(function() {\n  // Get the current date and time\n  var now = new Date().getTime();\n  // Find the time remaining between now and the event date\n  var timeRemaining = eventDate - now;\n  // Calculate days, hours, minutes and seconds remaining\n  var days = Math.floor(timeRemaining / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));\n  var hours = Math.floor((timeRemaining % (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)) / (1000 * 60 * 60));\n  var minutes = Math.floor((timeRemaining % (1000 * 60 * 60)) / (1000 * 60));\n  var seconds = Math.floor((timeRemaining % (1000 * 60)) / 1000);\n  // Display the countdown timer in the HTML page\n  document.getElementById(\"countdown\").innerHTML = \"Time Remaining: \" + days + \"d \" + hours + \"h \"\n  + minutes + \"m \" + seconds + \"s \";\n  // If the event has passed, display \"Event has ended\"\n  if (timeRemaining < 0) {\n    clearInterval(x);\n    document.getElementById(\"countdown\").innerHTML = \"Event has ended\";\n  }\n}, 1000);\n</script>\n```\n\nThis code will display a countdown timer on your HTML page, counting down to the space mission launch on December 15, 2023."
