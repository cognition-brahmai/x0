        "content": "I am having trouble with Vim and Python completion, specifically with the SuperTab plugin and non-system code. The issue arises when I use the import numpy.random line in my code. Completion works without the import line but breaks when it's included. However, running the code with the import line works fine. It seems that using the a.b form in import is causing the issue. Is there a way to fix this issue and get Python completion working properly with this form of import in Vim? \n\nHere is the code in question:\n\n```python\nimport numpy.random   # if this line is commented completion in last line works\n\nclass C(object):\n    def __init__(self, x_):\n        self.x=x_\n\n    def getX(self):\n        return self.x\n\n    def pr(self):\n        print 'ok'\n\na=C(10)  # nothing changes if I put C() instead, even though it would be wrong\na.  # here is completion in question\n```\n\nand here are my current settings in vimrc:\n\n```vim\nau FileType python set omnifunc=pythoncomplete#Complete\nlet g:SuperTabDefaultCompletionType = \"context\"\nlet g:SuperTabContextDefaultCompletionType = \"<c-n>\"\n```\n\nI didn't set a PYTHONPATH environment variable. Any suggestions would be appreciated."

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing with Vim's SuperTab plugin and Python completion when using imports like `import numpy.random` might be related to how the plugin or the completion mechanism interprets the namespace. Here are some steps and suggestions that might help resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Python Path is Correct:**\n   Even though you haven't set a `PYTHONPATH` environment variable, make sure that Vim is using the correct Python interpreter. You can do this by checking if Vim is compiled with Python support and is using the correct version of Python. You can check this by running `:version` inside Vim and looking for `+python` or `+python3`.\n\n2. **Try Full Import:**\n   Sometimes using the full import path can resolve these issues. Instead of `import numpy.random`, try importing it fully:\n   ```python\n   import numpy\n   ```\n\n3. **Check for Conflicting Plugins:**\n   Other plugins might interfere with SuperTab's functionality. Try disabling other plugins to see if the issue persists. You can do this by temporarily commenting out other plugins in your Vim configuration.\n\n4. **Update Plugins:**\n   Ensure that all your Vim plugins, including SuperTab, are up to date. Sometimes, these issues are resolved in newer versions.\n\n5. **Use a Different Completion Plugin:**\n   If the issue persists, you might want to try another completion plugin like `deoplete`, `YouCompleteMe`, or `coc.nvim`, which often have better support for complex completions and might handle these cases more gracefully.\n\n6. **Configure Python Completion:**\n   You might want to configure the Python completion settings more explicitly. You can try setting the completion function directly for Python files:\n   ```vim\n   autocmd FileType python setlocal omnifunc=python3complete#Complete\n   ```\n\n7. **Debugging:**\n   You can try debugging the issue by checking if the completion works in a minimal Vim setup. Create a minimal `vimrc` file with only the essential settings and plugins to see if the problem persists. This can help identify if the issue is due to a conflict with other settings or plugins.\n\n8. **Check for Errors:**\n   Run `:messages` in Vim to see if any errors are logged when you attempt the completion. This might give you a clue on what's going wrong.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue with Python completion when using the `import numpy.random` line. If the problem persists, consider reaching out to the community for the specific plugin you are using, as they might have encountered and resolved similar issues."
