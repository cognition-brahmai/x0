Specifically, I have files with names like `CHEESE_CHEESE_TYPE.***` and I wish to remove the `CHEESE_` portion from each filename, resulting in names like `CHEESE_TYPE`. I've tried using `os.path.split` and string manipulations, but I haven't been successful. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To rename multiple files in a directory by removing a specific prefix from each filename, you can use Python's `os` module to iterate through the files and rename them accordingly. Here's a step-by-step guide and a sample script to help you achieve this:\n\n1. Import the necessary modules.\n2. Define the directory containing the files.\n3. Iterate over each file in the directory.\n4. Check if the filename starts with the specified prefix.\n5. If it does, remove the prefix and rename the file.\n\nHere's a sample script to demonstrate this process:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Define the directory containing the files\ndirectory = '/path/to/your/directory'  # Replace with your directory path\n\n# Define the prefix to remove\nprefix = 'CHEESE_'\n\n# Iterate over each file in the directory\nfor filename in os.listdir(directory):\n    # Check if the filename starts with the specified prefix\n    if filename.startswith(prefix):\n        # Define the new filename by removing the prefix\n        new_filename = filename[len(prefix):]\n        \n        # Construct full file paths\n        old_file = os.path.join(directory, filename)\n        new_file = os.path.join(directory, new_filename)\n        \n        # Rename the file\n        os.rename(old_file, new_file)\n        print(f'Renamed: {filename} -> {new_filename}')\n\nprint('File renaming complete.')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **os.listdir(directory)**: Lists all files in the specified directory.\n- **filename.startswith(prefix)**: Checks if a filename starts with the specified prefix.\n- **filename[len(prefix):]**: Removes the prefix from the filename by slicing the string.\n- **os.rename(old_file, new_file)**: Renames the file from the old name to the new name.\n\nReplace `'/path/to/your/directory'` with the actual path to your directory. Run the script, and it will rename all files in the directory by removing the specified prefix. Make sure to back up your files before running the script to avoid accidental data loss."
