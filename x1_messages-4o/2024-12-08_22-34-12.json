Below is an example of a healthy daily schedule for a student formatted in JSON. It includes time for academics, physical activity, meals, and rest:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"time\": \"6:00AM\",\n    \"activity\": \"Wake up, drink water, stretch\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"time\": \"6:30AM\",\n    \"activity\": \"Meditate for 10 minutes\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"time\": \"7:00AM\",\n    \"activity\": \"Eat a healthy breakfast\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"time\": \"8:00AM\",\n    \"activity\": \"Attend morning classes\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"time\": \"12:00PM\",\n    \"activity\": \"Eat a balanced lunch\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"time\": \"1:00PM\",\n    \"activity\": \"Study or attend afternoon classes\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"time\": \"4:00PM\",\n    \"activity\": \"Exercise or engage in a physical activity\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"time\": \"6:00PM\",\n    \"activity\": \"Eat a light dinner\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"time\": \"7:00PM\",\n    \"activity\": \"Study or engage in extracurricular activities\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"time\": \"9:30PM\",\n    \"activity\": \"Start winding down for bed\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"time\": \"10:00PM\",\n    \"activity\": \"Go to bed and get a full 8 hours of sleep\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis schedule is designed to support a student's academic and personal growth while ensuring they have adequate time for rest and recreation. Adjustments can be made based on individual preferences, class schedules, and other commitments."
