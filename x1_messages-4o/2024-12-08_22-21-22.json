        "content": "To run a test suite using ScalaTest and Mockito frameworks in Scala, you'll first need to have your project set up with these dependencies. Assuming you have an `sbt` project, you should have the following dependencies in your `build.sbt` file:\n\n```scala\nlibraryDependencies ++= Seq(\n  \"org.scalatest\" %% \"scalatest\" % \"3.2.10\" % Test,\n  \"org.mockito\" %% \"mockito-scala\" % \"1.16.46\" % Test\n)\n```\n\nOnce you have your dependencies set up, you can create a test class using ScalaTest and Mockito. Here's a simple example:\n\n```scala\nimport org.scalatest.flatspec.AnyFlatSpec\nimport org.scalatest.matchers.should.Matchers\nimport org.mockito.scalatest.MockitoSugar\n\nclass MyTestClass extends AnyFlatSpec with Matchers with MockitoSugar {\n\n  \"A service\" should \"perform an action\" in {\n    // Create a mock of a dependency\n    val mockDependency = mock[SomeDependency]\n\n    // Define the behavior of the mock\n    when(mockDependency.someMethod()).thenReturn(\"mocked response\")\n\n    // Create an instance of the class under test, injecting the mock\n    val service = new MyService(mockDependency)\n\n    // Call the method under test\n    val result = service.performAction()\n\n    // Verify the result\n    result should be(\"expected result\")\n\n    // Verify interaction with the mock\n    verify(mockDependency).someMethod()\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `SomeDependency` is a dependency of `MyService`, and `performAction` is a method you want to test. You mock the dependency using Mockito, define the expected behavior, and then verify the result and interactions.\n\nTo run the test suite from the command line, you can use sbt with the `testOnly` command. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```shell\nsbt \"testOnly *MyTestClass -- -z \\\"perform an action\\\"\"\n```\n\nThis command will run only the test(s) in `MyTestClass` that match the name \"perform an action\". The `-z` option is used to filter tests by their names.\n\nMake sure to replace `MyTestClass` with the actual name of your test class, and adjust the test name as needed. If you want to run all tests in your project, you can simply use:\n\n```shell\nsbt test\n```\n\nThis will execute all the tests in your project without filtering."
