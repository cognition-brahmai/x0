How can I achieve this?\n\nHere are the classes for reference:\n\n```python\nclass Tag(models.Model):\n  name = models.CharField(maxlength=100)\n\nclass Blog(models.Model):\n  name = models.CharField(maxlength=100)\n  tags =  models.ManyToManyField(Tag)\n```"

        "content": "To query the `Blog` entries using tags in the three different ways you described, you can use the Django ORM as follows:\n\n1. **Find blog entries that are tagged with either \"tag1\" or \"tag2\":**\n\n   Your current code is almost correct, but you should use `tags__in` instead of `tags_in`. Assuming \"tag1\" and \"tag2\" have IDs 1 and 2, respectively, your query would be:\n\n   ```python\n   Blog.objects.filter(tags__in=[1, 2]).distinct()\n   ```\n\n2. **Find blog entries that are tagged with both \"tag1\" and \"tag2\":**\n\n   To find blog entries tagged with both tags, you can use the `intersection` of two querysets:\n\n   ```python\n   Blog.objects.filter(tags=1).filter(tags=2).distinct()\n   ```\n\n   Alternatively, you can use aggregation to count the number of tags and filter based on that count:\n\n   ```python\n   from django.db.models import Count\n\n   Blog.objects.annotate(num_tags=Count('tags')).filter(tags__in=[1, 2], num_tags=2).distinct()\n   ```\n\n   Note that in the second approach, you check that the number of tags for a blog is 2, which ensures that both tags are present.\n\n3. **Find blog entries that are tagged with exactly \"tag1\" and \"tag2\" and no other tags:**\n\n   For this, you need to ensure that the number of tags for the blog is exactly 2, and both tags are \"tag1\" and \"tag2\":\n\n   ```python\n   from django.db.models import Count\n\n   Blog.objects.annotate(num_tags=Count('tags')).filter(tags__in=[1, 2], num_tags=2).distinct().filter(tags=1).filter(tags=2)\n   ```\n\n   This query ensures that the blog has exactly two tags and both are the specified ones.\n\nBy using these queries, you can filter `Blog` entries based on the specified criteria regarding their associated tags."
