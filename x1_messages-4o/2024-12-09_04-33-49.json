        "content": "Creating a sunburst plot can be accomplished in both R and Python, using different libraries. Below, I'll guide you through the process for each language:\n\n### In R:\n\nWhile R does not have a direct library specifically for sunburst plots like those by John Stasko, you can use the `plotly` library to create interactive sunburst charts. Here's a basic example of how you can do it:\n\n1. **Install and load the `plotly` package:**\n\n   ```r\n   install.packages(\"plotly\")\n   library(plotly)\n   ```\n\n2. **Prepare your data:**\n\n   You'll need hierarchical data to create a sunburst plot. Here's a simple example dataset:\n\n   ```r\n   labels <- c(\"Root\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A1\", \"A2\", \"B1\", \"B2\", \"C1\")\n   parents <- c(\"\", \"Root\", \"Root\", \"Root\", \"A\", \"A\", \"B\", \"B\", \"C\")\n   values <- c(0, 10, 20, 30, 5, 5, 10, 10, 30)\n   ```\n\n3. **Create the sunburst plot:**\n\n   ```r\n   fig <- plot_ly(\n     labels = labels,\n     parents = parents,\n     values = values,\n     type = 'sunburst'\n   )\n\n   fig\n   ```\n\n### In Python:\n\nPython has a more straightforward approach for creating sunburst plots using libraries like `plotly` and `matplotlib`. Here\u2019s how you can do it with `plotly`:\n\n1. **Install plotly:**\n\n   If you haven't already, install plotly using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install plotly\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a sunburst plot:**\n\n   ```python\n   import plotly.express as px\n\n   # Example data\n   data = {\n       'labels': [\"Root\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A1\", \"A2\", \"B1\", \"B2\", \"C1\"],\n       'parents': [\"\", \"Root\", \"Root\", \"Root\", \"A\", \"A\", \"B\", \"B\", \"C\"],\n       'values': [0, 10, 20, 30, 5, 5, 10, 10, 30]\n   }\n\n   fig = px.sunburst(\n       names=data['labels'],\n       parents=data['parents'],\n       values=data['values']\n   )\n\n   fig.show()\n   ```\n\nBoth methods allow you to create a sunburst plot, and `plotly` is particularly useful for interactive visualizations. You can customize these plots further by exploring the various options available in the `plotly` documentation for both R and Python."
