I added a variable \"python\" with the value \"C:\\Python27\" under System Variables, but when I type \"python\" into the command prompt I get an error message saying 'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. I've tried following tutorials for older versions of Windows but they don't seem to work. How can I fix this?"

        "content": "To run a Python program from the Command Prompt on your Windows 7 machine, you need to ensure that the path to the Python executable is correctly added to your system's PATH environment variable. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you set it up:\n\n1. **Locate the Python executable:**\n   - First, make sure you know the exact path where Python is installed. It is usually something like `C:\\Python27\\python.exe`.\n\n2. **Edit System Environment Variables:**\n   - Right-click on \"Computer\" or \"My Computer\" on your desktop or in the Start menu, and select \"Properties.\"\n   - Click on \"Advanced system settings\" on the left side.\n   - In the System Properties window, click on the \"Environment Variables\" button.\n\n3. **Modify the PATH variable:**\n   - In the Environment Variables window, look for the \"Path\" variable in the \"System variables\" section.\n   - Select it and click \"Edit.\"\n   - In the \"Edit System Variable\" window, add the path to your Python installation at the end of the \"Variable value\" field. Make sure to separate it from any existing entries with a semicolon `;`.\n   - For example, if Python is installed in `C:\\Python27`, you would add `;C:\\Python27` to the end of the current path.\n\n4. **Verify the PATH addition:**\n   - Open a new Command Prompt window (you need to open a new one to reflect the changes).\n   - Type `python --version` and press Enter. If Python is correctly added to your PATH, it should display the version of Python installed.\n\n5. **Running a Python script:**\n   - Navigate to the directory where your Python script is located using the `cd` command.\n   - Type `python scriptname.py` (replace `scriptname.py` with the name of your script) and press Enter.\n\nIf you follow these steps and still encounter issues, double-check the path to the Python executable and ensure there are no typos. Also, make sure there are no conflicting Python installations that might be causing the problem."
