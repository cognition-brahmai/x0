        "content": "The error message you're encountering suggests that there's an issue with the version of `setuptools` installed on your system. This can happen if the version of `setuptools` is either outdated or incompatible with your current Python version. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Update `setuptools` and `pip`:**\n   It's important to make sure you have the latest versions of these tools. You can update them using the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.5 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools\n   ```\n\n2. **Ensure `pip` is installed:**\n   If `pip` is not installed, you can install it using `get-pip.py`. Download it using `wget` or `curl`:\n\n   ```bash\n   wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py\n   ```\n\n   Then run the script:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.5 get-pip.py\n   ```\n\n3. **Check your Python environment in PyCharm:**\n   Make sure that PyCharm is correctly configured to use the Python 3.5 interpreter. Go to `File > Settings > Project: YourProjectName > Project Interpreter` and ensure Python 3.5 is selected. If it's not, add it by clicking on the gear icon and selecting \"Add\".\n\n4. **Reinstall packages in PyCharm:**\n   Once you've updated `setuptools` and `pip`, try installing your packages again in PyCharm. You can do this by going to `File > Settings > Project: YourProjectName > Project Interpreter`, clicking on the \"+\" icon, searching for the package you need, and clicking \"Install Package\".\n\n5. **Clear Cache:**\n   Sometimes, clearing the PyCharm cache can resolve unexpected issues. Go to `File > Invalidate Caches / Restart` and choose `Invalidate and Restart`.\n\n6. **Check for any virtual environment issues:**\n   If you're using a virtual environment, make sure it's activated before running the `pip` commands. You can activate it using:\n\n   ```bash\n   source /path/to/your/venv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\nAfter following these steps, you should be able to install packages without encountering the `AttributeError`. If the issue persists, consider checking for any additional compatibility issues between Python 3.5 and the versions of the packages you're trying to install."
