How can I use SequenceMatcher correctly to get a valid similarity score between the two strings?"

        "content": "It looks like there is a minor issue in how you are initializing the `SequenceMatcher` object. You're initializing `SequenceMatcher` twice, which is unnecessary, and you aren't passing the arguments correctly. The `SequenceMatcher` takes `None` as the first argument, and then the two strings you want to compare. Your initialization should look like this:\n\n```python\nimport difflib\n\na = 'abcd'\nb = 'ab123'\nseq = difflib.SequenceMatcher(None, a.lower(), b.lower())\nd = seq.ratio() * 100\nprint(d)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what was corrected:\n\n1. The first argument to `SequenceMatcher` should be `None`. This is used for optional junk filtering, but for basic string similarity, you can set it to `None`.\n2. Ensure you only initialize `SequenceMatcher` once with the correct parameters.\n3. Make sure to use parentheses with `print` for Python 3 compatibility.\n\nThis code should give you a similarity score based on how similar the two strings are."
