        "content": "In Python, the behavior you're observing with `isinstance` and `issubclass` is due to the distinction between classes and instances.\n\n1. **`isinstance(Hello, object)` returns `True`:** \n\n   - In Python, classes themselves are instances of a metaclass, and all classes are ultimately instances of the `type` metaclass, which is a subclass of `object`. Thus, when you call `isinstance(Hello, object)`, you're checking if the class `Hello` (which is an instance of `type`) is an instance of `object`. Since `type` is a subclass of `object`, this returns `True`.\n\n2. **`issubclass(Hello, object)` returns `True`:**\n\n   - The statement `issubclass(Hello, object)` should actually return `True`. If you're seeing `False`, there might be a misunderstanding or misprint. `Hello` is a class that directly inherits from `object`, as all new-style classes do in Python 3 (and in Python 2 if they explicitly inherit from `object`). Therefore, `issubclass(Hello, object)` should correctly return `True`.\n\n3. **`isinstance(a, object)` returns `True`:**\n\n   - When you create an instance `a` of the class `Hello`, it is an object in Python. Since all instances of classes are objects in Python, `isinstance(a, object)` returns `True`.\n\nTo summarize, `issubclass(Hello, object)` should return `True` because `Hello` is indeed a subclass of `object`. If you're seeing `False`, it is likely due to an error elsewhere in the code or environment."
