In the first LSTM layer, I noticed that there is a parameter `return_sequences` set to `True`:\n\n```python\nregressor.add(LSTM(units = 30, return_sequences = True))\n```\n\nHowever, in the second LSTM layer, there is no `return_sequences` parameter defined:\n\n```python\nregressor.add(LSTM(units = 30))\n```\n\nI was under the assumption that `return_sequences` is mandatory as it should return the sequences. Can you please clarify why this parameter is not defined in the second LSTM layer?"

        "content": "Certainly! The `return_sequences` parameter in an LSTM layer determines what the layer outputs:\n\n1. **`return_sequences=True`:** The LSTM layer returns the full sequence of outputs for each input sequence. This is necessary when stacking multiple LSTM layers, except for the last one, because the subsequent LSTM layer requires the entire sequence of outputs as its input.\n\n2. **`return_sequences=False` (default):** The LSTM layer returns only the last output in the output sequence, which is a single vector. This is typically used in the final LSTM layer of a model when you only need the final output of the sequence to make predictions.\n\nIn your example:\n\n- **First LSTM Layer:** `return_sequences=True` is set because the output of this first LSTM layer is being fed into another LSTM layer. Therefore, the full sequence of outputs needs to be returned to ensure that the second LSTM layer receives the appropriate input shape.\n\n- **Second LSTM Layer:** The `return_sequences` parameter is not specified, which means it defaults to `False`. This is usually the case for the final LSTM layer in a sequence when you want to output only the last time step's output, which is often used for making a prediction or feeding into a dense layer.\n\nBy structuring the layers this way, you ensure that the data flows correctly through the network with each layer receiving the appropriate input shape."
