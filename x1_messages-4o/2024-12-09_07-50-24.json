For example, in my project I have a file structure with a \"data.py\" module that contains the variables 'foo', 'bar', and 'abc'. I want to be able to list these variables in another module, \"core.py\", where I import \"data.py\". I tried using the dir() function, however, it returns all the attributes of the module, including '__name__'. Is there a way to only return the variables defined in \"data.py\"?"

        "content": "To obtain a list of all the variables defined in a specific Python module while excluding the built-in attributes, you can filter the results from the `dir()` function. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this in your \"core.py\" module:\n\n1. **Import the module**: First, import the module from which you want to list the variables.\n\n2. **Get all attributes**: Use the `dir()` function to get a list of all the attributes in the module.\n\n3. **Filter out built-in attributes**: Filter this list to exclude any attributes that start with double underscores (`__`), which are typically built-in attributes.\n\n4. **Check for variables**: Optionally, you can further filter to ensure that the remaining attributes are variables by checking their types.\n\nHere's how you might implement this in \"core.py\":\n\n```python\nimport data\n\n# Get all attributes defined in data.py\nall_attributes = dir(data)\n\n# Filter out built-in attributes\nuser_defined_vars = [attr for attr in all_attributes if not attr.startswith('__')]\n\n# Optionally, check if the attribute is a variable (not a function or class)\nvariables = [var for var in user_defined_vars if not callable(getattr(data, var)) and not isinstance(getattr(data, var), type)]\n\nprint(\"Variables defined in data.py:\", variables)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- `dir(data)`: Lists all attributes in the `data` module.\n- `attr.startswith('__')`: Filters out any attributes that are likely built-in or system attributes.\n- `callable(getattr(data, var))`: Filters out any callable objects (functions, methods).\n- `isinstance(getattr(data, var), type)`: Filters out any classes.\n\nThis approach will give you a list of variables specifically defined in the `data.py` module. Adjust the filtering conditions as necessary to suit your specific requirements."
