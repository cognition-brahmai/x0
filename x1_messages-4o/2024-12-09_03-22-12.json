By \"equal\", I mean they have the same value and occupy the same position in both arrays. For example, if I have two arrays, A = [1, 2, 3, 4] and B = [1, 2, 4, 3], I would like the return value to be 2 because only the first and second elements are equal in both value and position in the two arrays. How can I achieve this in Python?"

Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define your arrays\nA = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])\nB = np.array([1, 2, 4, 3])\n\n# Perform element-wise comparison\ncomparison = A == B\n\n# Count the number of True values\nequal_elements_count = np.sum(comparison)\n\nprint(f\"The number of equal elements in the same position is: {equal_elements_count}\")\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `A == B` performs an element-wise comparison between the two arrays, resulting in a boolean array where each element is `True` if the corresponding elements in `A` and `B` are equal, and `False` otherwise.\n- `np.sum(comparison)` counts the number of `True` values in the boolean array, which gives the number of elements that are equal and in the same position in both arrays.\n\nRunning this code with the example arrays will give you the result `2`, as expected."
