We want to design an app that helps users plan a vacation based on their budget and preferred destination.\nThe app should allow users to input their budget and select a destination from the table. It should then calculate the total cost of the trip based on the number of days recommended for the destination and the average cost per day. The app should also provide recommendations for accommodations, activities, and restaurants based on user preferences.\nWhat features and functions should be included in the app to make it user-friendly and helpful for planning a vacation? How can we ensure that the app provides accurate and up-to-date information on destinations and travel costs?"
