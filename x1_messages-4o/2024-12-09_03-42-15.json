        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the GPU running out of memory (OOM \u2013 Out of Memory). This is a common issue when trying to train and evaluate models simultaneously, especially when GPU resources are limited. Here are some strategies you can use to address this problem:\n\n1. **Reduce Batch Size**: \n   - Decrease the batch size in your training and evaluation configuration. This can significantly reduce the amount of memory required. Edit the `pipeline_config_path` file and look for entries like `batch_size` under the `train_config` and `eval_config` sections and reduce the number.\n\n2. **Optimize GPU Usage**:\n   - Ensure that TensorFlow is allowing memory growth for the GPU to avoid allocating all memory at once. Add the following code at the beginning of your scripts:\n     ```python\n     import tensorflow as tf\n     from tensorflow.compat.v1 import ConfigProto\n     from tensorflow.compat.v1 import InteractiveSession\n\n     config = ConfigProto()\n     config.gpu_options.allow_growth = True\n     session = InteractiveSession(config=config)\n     ```\n\n3. **Alternate Training and Evaluation**:\n   - Instead of running training and evaluation at the same time, alternate between them. You can train for a few steps and then run evaluation. Automate this by writing a script that alternates between the two processes.\n\n4. **Use a Different GPU or Multi-GPU Setup**:\n   - If possible, use a different GPU for evaluation or use a multi-GPU setup to distribute the load. TensorFlow supports multi-GPU setups which might help balance the memory requirements.\n\n5. **Optimize Model**:\n   - Consider using a lighter model or pruning the existing model if possible. This may reduce the memory footprint.\n\n6. **Check Other Processes**:\n   - Ensure that no other processes are using the GPU memory. Use `nvidia-smi` to monitor GPU memory usage and terminate any unnecessary processes that are using the GPU.\n\n7. **Upgrade Hardware**:\n   - If none of the above solutions work and you need to train and evaluate simultaneously, you may need to consider upgrading to a GPU with more memory.\n\nBy implementing one or more of these strategies, you should be able to resolve the OOM error and proceed with your training and evaluation tasks."
