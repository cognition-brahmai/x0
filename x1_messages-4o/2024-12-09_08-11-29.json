The line of code that's causing the problem is `rot_image = rot_image.subsurface(rot_rect).copy()`, which throws the following exception: `ValueError: subsurface rectangle outside surface area`. Can someone help me to figure out what's wrong with my code?\n\nHere is the function I'm using to rotate an image:\n\n```python\ndef rot_center(image, angle):\n    \"\"\"rotate an image while keeping its center and size\"\"\"\n    orig_rect = image.get_rect()\n    rot_image = pygame.transform.rotate(image, angle)\n    rot_rect = orig_rect.copy()\n    rot_rect.center = rot_image.get_rect().center\n    rot_image = rot_image.subsurface(rot_rect).copy()\n    return rot_image\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with the `ValueError: subsurface rectangle outside surface area` arises because the rotated image might not fully encompass the original image's dimensions, especially when the image is rotated at certain angles. This can lead to trying to create a subsurface that is outside the bounds of the rotated surface.\n\nTo address this, you can modify the `rot_center` function to adjust the rectangle properly, ensuring it always fits within the bounds of the rotated image. Here's an updated version of the function:\n\n```python\nimport pygame\n\ndef rot_center(image, angle):\n    \"\"\"Rotate an image while keeping its center and size.\"\"\"\n    orig_rect = image.get_rect()\n    # Rotate the image\n    rot_image = pygame.transform.rotate(image, angle)\n    # Get the new rectangle of the rotated image\n    rot_rect = rot_image.get_rect(center=orig_rect.center)\n    return rot_image, rot_rect\n\n# Usage example:\n# screen is your display surface\n# image is your loaded image surface\n# angle is the angle by which you want to rotate the image\n\n# Call the function to get the rotated image and its new rect\nrotated_image, rotated_rect = rot_center(image, angle)\n\n# Blit the rotated image at its new position\nscreen.blit(rotated_image, rotated_rect.topleft)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Centering**: The `get_rect()` method is used with the `center` argument to ensure the rotated image retains the same center point as the original.\n\n2. **Returning Both Image and Rect**: The function returns both the rotated image and its new rectangle. This way, you can easily blit the image onto the screen using the updated position.\n\n3. **Avoiding Subsurface**: By adjusting the rectangle to match the center of the rotated image, you avoid the need to create a subsurface, which is what was causing the `ValueError`.\n\nBy using this approach, you should be able to rotate your image around its center without encountering the subsurface error."
