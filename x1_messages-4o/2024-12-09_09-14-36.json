Below, I'll guide you through a simple implementation:\n\n1. **Set Up Your React Native Environment:**\n   First, ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed. Then, set up your React Native environment by following the [official React Native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).\n\n2. **Initialize a New React Native Project:**\n   Use the following command to create a new React Native project:\n   ```bash\n   npx react-native init CountryListApp\n   ```\n   Navigate into your project directory:\n   ```bash\n   cd CountryListApp\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Required Packages:**\n   You might not need any additional packages for this example, but if you want to fetch data from an API, you can use `axios` or `fetch`.\n\n4. **Create a Component to Display the Country List:**\n   Edit the `App.js` file to include the necessary code for displaying the list of countries.\n\n   ```javascript\n   import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n   import { View, Text, FlatList, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\n\n   const App = () => {\n     const [countries, setCountries] = useState([]);\n\n     useEffect(() => {\n       const fetchCountries = async () => {\n         try {\n           const response = await fetch('https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all');\n           const data = await response.json();\n           setCountries(data);\n         } catch (error) {\n           console.error(error);\n         }\n       };\n\n       fetchCountries();\n     }, []);\n\n     const renderItem = ({ item }) => (\n       <View style={styles.item}>\n         <Text style={styles.title}>{item.name.common}</Text>\n       </View>\n     );\n\n     return (\n       <View style={styles.container}>\n         <FlatList\n           data={countries}\n           renderItem={renderItem}\n           keyExtractor={(item) => item.cca3}\n         />\n       </View>\n     );\n   };\n\n   const styles = StyleSheet.create({\n     container: {\n       flex: 1,\n       marginTop: 50,\n       paddingHorizontal: 20,\n     },\n     item: {\n       backgroundColor: '#f9c2ff',\n       padding: 20,\n       marginVertical: 8,\n     },\n     title: {\n       fontSize: 24,\n     },\n   });\n\n   export default App;\n   ```\n\n5. **Run Your Application:**\n   Run your app on your desired platform (iOS or Android) using the following command:\n   ```bash\n   npx react-native run-android\n   ```\n   or\n   ```bash\n   npx react-native run-ios\n   ```\n\n6. **Explanation:**\n   - **State Management:** We use `useState` to manage the list of countries.\n   - **Fetching Data:** We fetch data from the `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all` API to get the list of countries.\n   - **Rendering List:** We use the `FlatList` component to render the list of countries. Each country is displayed using the `renderItem` function, which returns a styled `View` containing the country name.\n\nThis simple setup should give you a basic React Native application displaying a list of countries using the `FlatList` component. You can further enhance it by adding search functionality, better styling, or additional features."
