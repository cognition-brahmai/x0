However, the console window remains open until I close the application. How can I launch the process without waiting for it to complete? Here is the code I used:\n\n```python\napp = \"C:\\Windows\\Notepad.exe\"\nfile = \"C:\\Path\\To\\File.txt\"\n\npid = subprocess.Popen(\n    [app, file], \n    shell=True, \n    stdin=subprocess.PIPE, \n    stdout=subprocess.PIPE,\n).pid\n```"

        "content": "To run a process without waiting for it to complete and ensure that the console window does not remain open, you can use the `subprocess.Popen` function with a few adjustments. Specifically, you might want to avoid redirecting `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` unless necessary, as this can sometimes cause the console to remain open. Additionally, you should set the `creationflags` parameter to `subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW` to prevent the console window from appearing when running the application.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\napp = r\"C:\\Windows\\Notepad.exe\"\nfile = r\"C:\\Path\\To\\File.txt\"\n\n# Use CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to prevent opening a new console window\ncreation_flags = subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW\n\n# Launch the process without waiting for it to complete\nsubprocess.Popen(\n    [app, file],\n    shell=True,\n    creationflags=creation_flags\n)\n```\n\nKey changes and notes:\n- Use raw strings (`r\"...\"`) for file paths to avoid issues with backslashes.\n- Set `creationflags` to `subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW` to prevent a console window from appearing.\n- Avoid redirecting `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` unless you need to capture or interact with the process's input or output.\n\nThis should help you run the process without keeping the console window open."
