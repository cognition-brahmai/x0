The air buzzes with anticipation as the professor writes a complex mathematical equation on the board.*\n\n**Professor:** (writing) Today\u2019s challenge, folks, is to solve this equation: \n\n\\[\nx^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0\n\\]\n\n*Enter RAJ, an ambitious Indian student, and MARIA, a passionate Spanish student. They lock eyes, the rivalry palpable.*\n\n**Raj:** (murmuring in Hindi) \u092f\u0939 \u0906\u0938\u093e\u0928 \u0939\u0948\u0964 \u092e\u0948\u0902 \u0907\u0938\u0947 \u0939\u0932 \u0915\u0930 \u0932\u0942\u0902\u0917\u093e\u0964 (This is easy. I will solve it.)\n\n**Maria:** (whispering in Spanish) No tan r\u00e1pido, Raj. Esto es m\u00edo. (Not so fast, Raj. This is mine.)\n\n**Scene 2: The Library**\n\n*Setting: The university library, filled with the aroma of old books. Raj and Maria sit at a table, furiously scribbling notes.*\n\n**Raj:** (in English, breaking the silence) Maybe we should work together. This equation could be the key to our final grades.\n\n*Maria pauses, considering his offer.*\n\n**Maria:** (in English) Only if you promise not to hold back. \n\n*They nod, an unspoken agreement forming.*\n\n**Scene 3: The Breakthrough**\n\n*Setting: The dimly lit library room, cluttered with papers. The clock ticks loudly, indicating late hours.*\n\n*Raj and Maria are deep in concentration, speaking a mix of Hindi, Spanish, and English as they work through the equation.*\n\n**Maria:** (pointing at the paper) If we substitute \\(x = 1\\), it satisfies the equation. \n\n**Raj:** (excitedly) Yes! And for \\(x = 2\\) and \\(x = 3\\) as well. The roots are 1, 2, and 3!\n\n*They share a triumphant high-five, their rivalry slowly turning into camaraderie.*\n\n**Scene 4: The Revelation**\n\n*Setting: A quiet caf\u00e9 where Raj and Maria celebrate their success. Enter LUCAS, a mysterious figure who watches them from a distance.*\n\n**Lucas:** (in a low voice, speaking to an unknown person on the phone in French) Oui, ils sont ensemble maintenant. Continuez avec le plan. (Yes, they are together now. Continue with the plan.)\n\n*Lucas approaches their table, pretending to be a friendly acquaintance.*\n\n**Lucas:** (in English) Congratulations on your breakthrough. I\u2019ve heard a lot about your teamwork.\n\n*Raj and Maria smile warmly, unaware of the hidden intentions.*\n\n**Scene 5: The Twist**\n\n*Setting: The same caf\u00e9, now with tension in the air. Raj finds a suspicious note in his bag.*\n\n**Raj:** (confused, reading aloud) \u2018Beware of false friends. Someone is not who they seem.\u2019\n\n*Maria looks shocked, her face a mix of disbelief and hurt. Lucas watches from afar, a smirk on his face.*\n\n**Maria:** (in Spanish) \u00bfPero qui\u00e9n har\u00eda algo as\u00ed? (But who would do such a thing?)\n\n**Scene 6: The Confrontation**\n\n*Setting: The university courtyard. Raj and Maria confront Lucas.*\n\n**Raj:** (angrily) Lucas, why are you doing this? We thought you were a friend.\n\n**Lucas:** (shrugging, unapologetic) Business is business. Your friendship was a threat to some people.\n\n*Maria and Raj exchange a knowing look, their bond stronger than the betrayal.*\n\n**Maria:** (determined) We\u2019ll solve this, Raj. Together.\n\n*They walk away, united against the odds, their friendship solidified through adversity.*\n\n**End Scene**"
