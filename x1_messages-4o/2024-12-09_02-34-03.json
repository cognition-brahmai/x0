While I have been able to normalize the training data using Gaussian, I am unsure about how to normalize the outputs since it only has a single dimension. Specifically, given a raw input vector like -128.91, 71.076, -100.75,4.2475, -98.811, 77.219, 4.4096, -15.382, -6.1477, -361.18, and its normalised counterpart -0.6049, 1.0412, -0.3731, 0.4912, -0.3571, 1.0918, 0.4925, 0.3296, 0.4056, -2.5168, the raw expected output is 1183.6, but I don't know how to normalize it. Should the expected output be normalized as part of the input vector?"

        "content": "When dealing with neural networks, normalization of both inputs and outputs can help improve the training process and performance of the model. However, the approach to normalizing the outputs can sometimes differ from the inputs, especially if the outputs have a different scale or distribution.\n\nFor your single-dimensional output, you can normalize it separately from the input vectors. Here are a few common methods to normalize outputs:\n\n1. **Min-Max Scaling**: If you know the range of your output values, you can scale them to a specific range, usually [0, 1] or [-1, 1]. The formula for min-max scaling is:\n\n   \\[\n   y_{\\text{norm}} = \\frac{y - y_{\\text{min}}}{y_{\\text{max}} - y_{\\text{min}}}\n   \\]\n\n   where \\(y\\) is your raw output, and \\(y_{\\text{min}}\\) and \\(y_{\\text{max}}\\) are the minimum and maximum of your output dataset.\n\n2. **Z-Score Normalization (Standardization)**: This method involves scaling the outputs so that they have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. This is especially useful if the outputs are normally distributed:\n\n   \\[\n   y_{\\text{norm}} = \\frac{y - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n   \\]\n\n   where \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of the output data and \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation.\n\n3. **Log Transformation**: If your outputs are skewed or have large ranges, applying a log transformation can help stabilize variance and make the distribution more normal.\n\n4. **Custom Range Scaling**: If your application requires outputs to be in a specific range, you can apply a custom scaling method similar to min-max scaling.\n\nIn your case, if your outputs are similar in scale to your inputs or if there's a known range they fit within, min-max scaling might be appropriate. However, if your outputs cover a wide range or are not uniformly distributed, using Z-score normalization or log transformation could be beneficial.\n\nRemember to apply the inverse transformation to the neural network's output during inference to bring them back to their original scale, especially if you need to interpret the results in their original units."
