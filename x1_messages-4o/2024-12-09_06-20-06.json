I am using a context manager to automatically close files, and I want to read contents of several files by creating an iterator. However, I am unsure if it is safe to yield open files. If the consumer never comes back to the iterator for the next file due to an exception or some other reason, I am concerned that the iterator code would never resume, and the open file object would never get closed. Could you provide insights into this?\n\nHere is the code:\n\n```python\nwith open('filename') as my_file:\n    # do something with my_file\n\n# my_file gets automatically closed after exiting 'with' block\n\ndef select_files():\n    \"\"\"Yields carefully selected and ready-to-read-from files\"\"\"\n    file_names = [.......]\n    for fname in file_names:\n        with open(fname) as my_open_file:\n            yield my_open_file\n\nfor file_obj in select_files():\n    for line in file_obj:\n        # do something useful\n```"

        "content": "Combining the `with` statement and `yield` within a single function can indeed introduce issues if the iterator is not fully consumed. The `with` statement is designed to automatically close resources, such as files, when the block is exited. However, when used with `yield`, control is transferred back to the caller, and the context manager may not be exited immediately if the generator is not fully iterated over.\n\nThis can lead to a situation where files remain open if the generator is not exhausted. In your code, if an exception occurs or the loop is exited before consuming all files, the `with` block for those files will not be exited, and the files will remain open.\n\nTo handle this situation safely, consider using a contextlib utility called `contextlib.closing`, or refactor the code to ensure that files are properly closed. Here's one approach using a custom context manager:\n\n```python\nfrom contextlib import contextmanager\n\n@contextmanager\ndef get_file(file_name):\n    \"\"\"Context manager to yield a file object and ensure it gets closed.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        f = open(file_name)\n        yield f\n    finally:\n        f.close()\n\ndef select_files():\n    \"\"\"Yields carefully selected and ready-to-read-from files\"\"\"\n    file_names = [.......]\n    for fname in file_names:\n        with get_file(fname) as my_open_file:\n            yield my_open_file\n\nfor file_obj in select_files():\n    for line in file_obj:\n        # do something useful\n```\n\nIn this refactored code, the `get_file` context manager ensures that every file is properly closed even if the generator is not fully consumed. By wrapping the file access in a separate context manager, you ensure that resources are managed correctly."
