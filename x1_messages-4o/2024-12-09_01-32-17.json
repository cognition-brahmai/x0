Here's how you can do it:\n\n```bash\ndate +%Y-%m-%d\n```\n\nHere's a quick breakdown of the format specifiers used:\n\n- `%Y` - Year in four digits (e.g., 2023)\n- `%m` - Month in two digits (e.g., 01 for January)\n- `%d` - Day of the month in two digits (e.g., 09)\n\nSo, when you run `date +%Y-%m-%d`, it will output the current date in the format you want, like `2023-11-03`. Make sure to include the `+` sign when specifying the format with the `date` command."
