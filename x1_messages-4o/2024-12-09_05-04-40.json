However, when I try to use it in the source code, I get a `SyntaxError: 'return' outside function`. Also, the `return` statement is often useful in a module, for example, I want to write some code at the beginning of a module where I don't want to raise an exception because that would prevent the module from loading. I have managed to manipulate the Python bytecode to just do the return by jumping to the end where the return is done using some code I put together, but this only works in CPython because there is no standard way to manipulate a code object. I am looking for a solid explanation or evidence, perhaps past statements from Guido van Rossum, as to why this language design decision was taken."

        "content": "The restriction on using the `return` statement at the top level of a Python module is primarily due to the design and intended use of modules in Python. Modules are meant to be collections of variables, functions, and classes, and they are not designed to execute in the same way that functions do, where a `return` statement is used to exit and optionally pass back a value.\n\nHere's a more detailed explanation of why `return` is not allowed at the module level:\n\n1. **Execution Flow**: When a Python module is imported, the code at the top level of the module is executed. This execution is meant to initialize the module. The `return` statement is unnecessary in this context because there's no function call to return from. If `return` were allowed at the module level, it could disrupt this initialization process and make the module's behavior unpredictable.\n\n2. **Purpose of `return`**: In Python, the `return` statement is used to exit a function and optionally provide a return value. Since modules are not functions, they do not have a return value in the same sense. The module's public API is defined by the variables, functions, and classes it makes available, not by a single return value.\n\n3. **Consistency and Simplicity**: Allowing `return` at the module level could introduce complexity and confusion. It would require defining what it means to return from a module and how that interacts with Python's import system. This complexity is avoided by simply not allowing `return` at the module level.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: The typical way to handle errors during module initialization is through exception handling, not by returning early from the module. Using exceptions allows you to explicitly manage errors and provide meaningful messages or fallback behavior.\n\nAs for any past statements from Guido van Rossum or other core developers, specific comments on this detail are rare, as many design decisions are based on overarching principles of simplicity, readability, and the intended use cases of language constructs.\n\nIf you find yourself needing to conditionally prevent a module from being used, consider raising an exception or restructuring your code to encapsulate that logic within a function or class. This approach adheres to Python's design philosophy and makes the intent of your code clearer."
