        "content": "Certainly! Let's analyze the data set provided to determine the relationship between the x and y values:\n\n| X-axis | Y-axis |\n|--------|--------|\n| 0      | 0      |\n| 2      | 4      |\n| 4      | 8      |\n\nTo find a mathematical formula that relates the x and y values, let's look for a pattern or a consistent operation that transforms x into y.\n\n1. When \\( x = 0 \\), \\( y = 0 \\).\n2. When \\( x = 2 \\), \\( y = 4 \\).\n3. When \\( x = 4 \\), \\( y = 8 \\).\n\nObserving the values, it appears that the y value is consistently double the x value. This can be expressed as a simple linear equation:\n\n\\[ y = 2x \\]\n\nLet's verify this equation with the given data points:\n\n- For \\( x = 0 \\): \\( y = 2 \\times 0 = 0 \\) (Matches)\n- For \\( x = 2 \\): \\( y = 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\) (Matches)\n- For \\( x = 4 \\): \\( y = 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\) (Matches)\n\nThe equation \\( y = 2x \\) accurately describes the relationship between x and y for the given data set."
