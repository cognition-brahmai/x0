        "content": "When you're trying to append or modify files like `/etc/hosts` that require elevated permissions, the redirection operators `>` and `>>` don't work directly with `sudo` because the redirection is handled by the shell, which doesn't have the elevated permissions. However, you can achieve this by using one of the following methods:\n\n### Method 1: Using `sudo tee`\nYou can use `sudo` in combination with `tee` to append to the file. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```bash\necho \"127.0.0.1 example.com\" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts\n```\n\n- The `-a` option with `tee` appends the output to the file.\n\n### Method 2: Using `echo` and `sudo bash -c`\nAnother method involves using `bash -c` with `sudo` to execute the echo command:\n\n```bash\nsudo bash -c 'echo \"127.0.0.1 example.com\" >> /etc/hosts'\n```\n\n- This runs the command inside the quotes with elevated privileges.\n\n### Method 3: Using a text editor with `sudo`\nYou can also use a text editor with `sudo` to manually edit the file:\n\n```bash\nsudo nano /etc/hosts\n```\n\nOr, for `vim`:\n\n```bash\nsudo vim /etc/hosts\n```\n\n- This allows you to manually add entries to the file.\n\n### Method 4: Using `sed` with `sudo`\nIf you want to append a line conditionally or perform more complex edits, you can use `sed`:\n\n```bash\necho \"127.0.0.1 example.com\" | sudo sed -i '$ a\\' /etc/hosts\n```\n\n- This appends a line at the end of the file.\n\nThese methods should allow you to append lines to `/etc/hosts` or similar files without needing to switch to the root user."
