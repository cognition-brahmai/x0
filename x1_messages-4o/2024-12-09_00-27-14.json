        "content": "The error you're encountering is because you're opening the CSV file in binary mode (`\"rb\"`) instead of text mode. In Python 3, the `csv` module expects to work with text strings, not bytes. To fix this issue, you should open the file in text mode (`\"r\"`) and specify the correct encoding, usually `\"utf-8\"`. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\n# Open the CSV file in text mode\nwith open('sample.csv', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as ifile:\n    read = csv.reader(ifile)\n    \n    # Iterate over each row in the CSV reader object\n    for row in read:\n        print(row)\n```\n\nThis should resolve the error, and your code will read and print each row of the CSV file correctly. Note that using a `with` statement to open the file is a good practice because it ensures the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised."
