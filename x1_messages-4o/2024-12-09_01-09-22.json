In the Jupyter notebook command group, there is a command labeled \"automatically indent selection\". When I use the command mode control-/ for this command, the notebook does block commenting instead of indenting. I can't find any other command that refers to indenting. How can I get a command shortcut to work for block indenting and un-indenting in Jupyter notebooks?"

        "content": "In Jupyter notebooks, indenting and un-indenting blocks of code can often be done using keyboard shortcuts. However, these shortcuts can sometimes be different depending on the operating system or the configuration. Here's how you can typically accomplish block indenting and un-indenting:\n\n### Indenting and Un-indenting in Jupyter Notebooks\n\n1. **Indenting (Increase Indent):**\n   - You can usually increase the indent of a selected block of code by pressing `Tab`.\n\n2. **Un-indenting (Decrease Indent):**\n   - To decrease the indent level, you can usually press `Shift + Tab`.\n\n### Customizing Shortcuts\n\nIf the above shortcuts are not working or if you want to customize them, you can change the keyboard shortcuts in Jupyter:\n\n1. **Access Keyboard Shortcuts:**\n   - Go to the \"Help\" menu in the Jupyter notebook toolbar.\n   - Select \"Edit Keyboard Shortcuts.\"\n\n2. **Set Custom Shortcuts:**\n   - In the dialog that appears, you can search for \"indent\" or \"dedent\" to find the appropriate actions.\n   - Set your preferred shortcut keys for these actions.\n\n### Using Command Mode\n\n- Ensure that you are in the **Edit Mode** (where you can type in the cells) and not in **Command Mode** (where you navigate around the cells) when trying to indent or un-indent blocks of code.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n- If the shortcuts are still not working as expected, make sure your browser or Jupyter notebook server is not intercepting the key combinations.\n- Sometimes extensions or custom configurations can override default behaviors. Check if any extensions are influencing the keyboard shortcuts.\n\nBy checking and possibly customizing your shortcuts, you should be able to efficiently indent and un-indent code blocks in Jupyter notebooks."
