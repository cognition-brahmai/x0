Scott Fitzgerald but also encompasses an equally impactful author, publisher, and era, along with any subtextual, historical, or cultural references? It would be preferable if the book also explores deeper themes, such as the effects of mental illness and the decline of American morality in the 1920s. Please provide the title, author, and publisher of the recommended book."

        "content": "Certainly! A literary work that parallels \"The Great Gatsby\" in themes, motifs, writing style, and historical context is \"This Side of Paradise\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald himself. Published by Charles Scribner's Sons in 1920, this novel explores themes of youthful disillusionment and the moral decay of the American Dream, much like \"The Great Gatsby.\"\n\n\"This Side of Paradise\" delves into the life of Amory Blaine, a young man from a privileged background, and his experiences with love, education, and social status. The novel is set against the backdrop of the post-World War I era, capturing the cultural shifts and existential uncertainties of the 1920s.\n\nIn terms of deeper themes, Fitzgerald touches on the effects of mental illness through Amory's introspective struggles and existential crises. Additionally, the novel sheds light on the decline of American morality during the Jazz Age, exploring the superficiality and hedonism that characterized the period.\n\nFitzgerald's use of rich, lyrical prose and his exploration of complex characters and societal issues make \"This Side of Paradise\" a compelling companion to \"The Great Gatsby,\" offering further insights into the author's critique of early 20th-century American society."
