You can adjust the `repeatCount` variable to change how many times \"Hello World\" is printed.\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        int repeatCount = 5; // Change this to print more or fewer times\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < repeatCount; i++)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, \"Hello World\" will be printed 5 times. You can modify the `repeatCount` variable to any number you wish to print \"Hello World\" that many times."
