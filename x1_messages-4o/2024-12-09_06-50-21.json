The SQL is as follows:\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM Residents\nWHERE apartment_id IN (SELECT ID\n                       FROM Apartments\n                       WHERE postcode = 2000)\n```\nI've tried executing it as raw SQL using `db.engine.execute(sql)`, but it complains that my relations don't exist. However, I've been successful in querying my database using the `session.Query(Residents).filter_by(???)` format. How can I build my desired query using this format?"

        "content": "To translate your SQL query into SQLAlchemy, you'll want to use the ORM's capabilities to construct subqueries. Here's how you can achieve the desired result using SQLAlchemy's ORM:\n\n1. Define your models if you haven't already. Let's assume you have `Residents` and `Apartments` models defined.\n\n2. Construct the subquery for `Apartments` to get the IDs where the `postcode` is `2000`.\n\n3. Use this subquery in the main query to filter `Residents`.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine, select\nfrom your_model_file import Residents, Apartments  # Import your models\n\n# Assume that 'engine' is your SQLAlchemy engine\nSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\nsession = Session()\n\n# Create the subquery for Apartments\nsubquery = session.query(Apartments.id).filter(Apartments.postcode == 2000).subquery()\n\n# Use the subquery in the main query for Residents\nquery = session.query(Residents).filter(Residents.apartment_id.in_(subquery))\n\n# Execute the query to get results\nresults = query.all()\n\n# Process the results as needed\nfor resident in results:\n    print(resident)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Subquery Construction**: We created a subquery that selects the `id` from `Apartments` where `postcode` is `2000`.\n\n- **Main Query**: The main query for `Residents` uses the `.filter(Residents.apartment_id.in_(subquery))` to filter residents whose `apartment_id` is in the list of IDs from the subquery.\n\n- **Execution**: Finally, we execute the query with `.all()` to fetch all matching records.\n\nMake sure your models are correctly set up and mapped to the respective database tables. If your model definitions align with your database schema, this approach should work efficiently without needing to resort to raw SQL execution."
