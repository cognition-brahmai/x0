        "content": "To resolve the issues you're encountering, let's address them one by one:\n\n### Issue 1: SyntaxError: Non-ASCII character\n\nThis error is related to the presence of a non-ASCII character in your code file. Python 2.x requires you to specify the encoding at the start of the file if it contains non-ASCII characters. To fix this, add the following line at the beginning of your file:\n\n```python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n```\n\nThis declaration tells Python to interpret the file as UTF-8 encoded, which should resolve the SyntaxError.\n\n### Issue 2: UnicodeDecodeError in Python 3\n\nIn Python 3, you encountered a `UnicodeDecodeError` when loading the NLTK POS tagger. This happens because the `nltk` library is trying to read files using ASCII encoding by default. Here\u2019s how you can fix it:\n\n1. **Ensure the NLTK data is downloaded:** Make sure you have the required NLTK data files. You can install them using the following command in your Python environment:\n\n    ```python\n    import nltk\n    nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')\n    nltk.download('punkt')\n    ```\n\n2. **Use UTF-8 encoding to read files:** When reading files (e.g., `english.txt`, `neg.txt`, etc.), ensure you open them with UTF-8 encoding:\n\n    ```python\n    stopWords = open(\"english.txt\", \"r\", encoding=\"utf-8\")\n    negWords = open(\"neg.txt\", \"r\", encoding=\"utf-8\")\n    posWords = open(\"pos.txt\", \"r\", encoding=\"utf-8\")\n    incrWords = open(\"incr.txt\", \"r\", encoding=\"utf-8\")\n    decrWords = open(\"decr.txt\", \"r\", encoding=\"utf-8\")\n    invWords = open(\"inverse.txt\", \"r\", encoding=\"utf-8\")\n    ```\n\n3. **Handle string encoding explicitly:** Ensure all strings are handled using UTF-8 encoding. In Python 2, you may need to use `u''` literals for Unicode strings.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- **Switch to Python 3:** If possible, switch to using Python 3 for your project as Python 2 is no longer supported, and Python 3 handles Unicode more gracefully.\n  \n- **Check your text processing:** Make sure your text cleaning and tokenization steps are appropriate for your input data, especially when handling Unicode characters.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the errors and run your sentiment analysis code successfully. If you continue to experience issues, consider printing intermediate results to diagnose where the problem might lie."
