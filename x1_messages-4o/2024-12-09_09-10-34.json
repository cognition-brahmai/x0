Here's a simple Python code snippet that takes a sequence of numbers separated by commas as input and generates a list of these numbers:\n\n```python\ndef generate_number_list(input_string):\n    # Split the input string by commas and strip whitespace\n    number_list = [int(num.strip()) for num in input_string.split(',')]\n    return number_list\n\n# Example usage\ninput_string = input(\"Enter a sequence of numbers separated by commas: \")\nnumber_list = generate_number_list(input_string)\nprint(\"Generated list of numbers:\", number_list)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `generate_number_list` that takes a string as input, splits it by commas, strips any whitespace from each element, converts each element to an integer, and returns the list of numbers. You can run the example usage to see how it works."
