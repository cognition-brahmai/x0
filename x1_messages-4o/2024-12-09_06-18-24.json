        "content": "To calculate the base 10 logarithm of each element in an array in Python, you can use the `log10` function from the `math` or `numpy` library. Here's how you can do it with both libraries:\n\n### Using the `math` library:\n```python\nimport math\n\nx = [1500, 1049.8, 34, 351]  # Example array\nlog_x = [math.log10(num) for num in x]\n\nprint(log_x)\n```\n\n### Using the `numpy` library:\nIf you're dealing with larger datasets or need to perform the operation more efficiently, using `numpy` is a better choice:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nx = np.array([1500, 1049.8, 34, 351])  # Convert the list to a numpy array\nlog_x = np.log10(x)  # Take the base 10 logarithm of each element\n\nprint(log_x)\n```\n\nBoth methods will give you an array (or list) where each element is the base 10 logarithm of the corresponding element in the original array."
