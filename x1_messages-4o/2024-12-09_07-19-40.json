        "content": "To detect if the system is idle on Windows using Python, you can utilize the `ctypes` library to access the Windows API function `GetLastInputInfo`. This function can help determine the time elapsed since the last input was detected (keyboard or mouse activity). Here's a step-by-step guide along with the code to achieve this:\n\n1. Import the necessary modules.\n2. Define the `LASTINPUTINFO` structure.\n3. Use `ctypes` to call `GetLastInputInfo`.\n4. Calculate the idle time based on the current time and the last input time.\n\nHere's a sample implementation:\n\n```python\nimport ctypes\nfrom ctypes import wintypes\nimport time\n\nclass LASTINPUTINFO(ctypes.Structure):\n    _fields_ = [(\"cbSize\", ctypes.c_uint),\n                (\"dwTime\", ctypes.c_uint)]\n\ndef get_idle_duration():\n    last_input_info = LASTINPUTINFO()\n    last_input_info.cbSize = ctypes.sizeof(LASTINPUTINFO)\n\n    # Get the time of the last input event\n    if ctypes.windll.user32.GetLastInputInfo(ctypes.byref(last_input_info)):\n        millis = ctypes.windll.kernel32.GetTickCount() - last_input_info.dwTime\n        return millis / 1000.0  # Convert milliseconds to seconds\n    else:\n        return 0\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    while True:\n        idle_time = get_idle_duration()\n        print(f\"System Idle Time: {idle_time} seconds\")\n        time.sleep(1)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **LASTINPUTINFO Structure**: This structure is used to store information about the last input event.\n- **GetLastInputInfo**: This function populates the `LASTINPUTINFO` structure with the time of the last input event.\n- **GetTickCount**: Returns the number of milliseconds since the system was started. By subtracting the time of the last input from the current tick count, you get the idle time in milliseconds.\n- **Idle Duration**: The idle time is calculated in milliseconds and converted to seconds for easier interpretation.\n\nBy running this script, you can continuously monitor and print the system's idle time in seconds. You can modify the loop and the sleep duration as needed for your application."
