        "content": "To achieve this task using C++, you'll need to follow a few steps:\n\n1. **Fetch the Article Content**: You need a way to retrieve the content from the Wikipedia page. This can be done using libraries like cURL to perform HTTP requests.\n\n2. **Extract and Process Text**: Once you have the HTML content, you'll need to parse it and extract the relevant text. Libraries like Gumbo or Beautiful Soup (in C++) can be helpful.\n\n3. **Summarize the Content**: You can use simple text processing to summarize the content. This could involve extracting key sentences or using a predefined summary.\n\nHere's a basic outline of how you might structure this in C++:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n#include <curl/curl.h>\n#include <sstream>\n\n// Function to write data from cURL to a stringstream\nsize_t WriteCallback(void* contents, size_t size, size_t nmemb, void* userp) {\n    ((std::stringstream*)userp)->write((char*)contents, size * nmemb);\n    return size * nmemb;\n}\n\nstd::string fetchWikipediaContent(const std::string& url) {\n    CURL* curl;\n    CURLcode res;\n    std::stringstream contentStream;\n\n    curl = curl_easy_init();\n    if(curl) {\n        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, url.c_str());\n        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION, WriteCallback);\n        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEDATA, &contentStream);\n        res = curl_easy_perform(curl);\n        curl_easy_cleanup(curl);\n    }\n    return contentStream.str();\n}\n\nstd::string summarizeContent(const std::string& content) {\n    // Placeholder: Implement a basic summarization algorithm or extract key sentences\n    // For simplicity, we'll just return a hardcoded summary as an example\n    return \"2007-2008 financial crisis: Global banking collapse due to risky loans, leading to economic downturn.\";\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::string url = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008\";\n    std::string content = fetchWikipediaContent(url);\n    std::string summary = summarizeContent(content);\n    std::cout << \"Summary: \" << summary << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **cURL**: Used for HTTP requests to fetch the content from the URL.\n- **Text Parsing**: You would need to parse the HTML to extract meaningful text. This might involve more complex parsing logic.\n- **Summarization**: This example uses a hardcoded summary. For an automated approach, you could implement a basic algorithm to extract key sentences or use a machine learning model if you have access to one.\n\nRemember that summarization is a complex task, and for a more accurate summary, you might need more sophisticated natural language processing techniques, which might be easier to implement in languages with robust NLP libraries like Python."
