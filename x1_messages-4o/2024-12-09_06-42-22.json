        "content": "To export a DataFrame as a CSV file from Google Colab to Google Drive, you need to ensure that you're using the correct MIME type and file extension. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n1. **Install the Required Libraries**: Ensure that you have the `pydrive` library installed, which facilitates interaction with Google Drive.\n\n2. **Authenticate and Connect to Google Drive**: Use the correct method to authenticate and connect to Google Drive.\n\n3. **Save the DataFrame as a CSV File**: Use `df.to_csv()` with the correct file extension.\n\n4. **Upload the CSV to Google Drive**: Use the `pydrive` library to upload the file.\n\nHere's the complete code to achieve this:\n\n```python\n# Install required libraries\n!pip install -U -q PyDrive\n\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom pydrive.auth import GoogleAuth\nfrom pydrive.drive import GoogleDrive\nfrom google.colab import auth\nfrom oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials\n\n# Create a sample DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({1: [1, 2, 3]})\n\n# Save the DataFrame to a CSV file\ndf.to_csv('sample.csv', index=False)  # Ensure you use a .csv extension\n\n# Authenticate and create the PyDrive client\nauth.authenticate_user()\ngauth = GoogleAuth()\ngauth.credentials = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()\ndrive = GoogleDrive(gauth)\n\n# Create & upload a file to Google Drive\nuploaded = drive.CreateFile({'title': 'sample.csv'})  # Title with .csv extension\nuploaded.SetContentFile('sample.csv')\nuploaded.Upload()\n\nprint('Uploaded file with ID {}'.format(uploaded.get('id')))\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **File Extension**: Ensure the file you save locally is named with a `.csv` extension.\n- **MIME Type**: For CSV files, you typically don't need to specify a MIME type when using PyDrive; it will automatically recognize it based on the file extension.\n- **Index**: If you do not want the DataFrame's index to be included in the CSV, use `index=False` in the `to_csv()` function.\n\nThis should correctly upload your CSV file to Google Drive. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to upload files to your Google Drive."
