Here is an example of my code:\n\n```python\nimport concurrent.futures  # line 01\ndef f(x):  # line 02\n    return x * x  # line 03\ndata = [1, 2, 3, None, 5]  # line 04\nwith concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(len(data)) as executor:  # line 05\n    futures = [executor.submit(f, n) for n in data]  # line 06\n    for future in futures:  # line 07\n        print(future.result())  # line 08\n```\n\nWhen I run this, I get the following output:\n\n```python\n1\n4\n9\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"C:\\test.py\", line 8, in <module>\n    print future.result()  # line 08\n  File \"C:\\dev\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\futures-2.1.4-py2.7.egg\\concurrent\\futures\\_base.py\", line 397, in result\n    return self.__get_result()\n  File \"C:\\dev\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\futures-2.1.4-py2.7.egg\\concurrent\\futures\\_base.py\", line 356, in __get_result\n    raise self._exception\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'NoneType' and 'NoneType'\n```\n\nI am receiving a TypeError, but the string `\"...\\_base.py\", line 356, in __get_result\"` is not the endpoint I expected to see. I would like to get the real line where the exception was thrown, like this:\n\n```python\n  File \"C:\\test.py\", line 3, in f\n    return x * x  # line 03\n```\n\nPython3 seems to show the correct line number in this case. Is there a reason why Python 2.7 doesn't? Is there any workaround for this?"

        "content": "In Python 2.7, the handling of exceptions in concurrent futures does not always provide the exact traceback of where the error occurred in the user-defined function. This is because the exception is raised in the context of the `futures` library rather than directly in your code, which can obscure the original line number.\n\nHere's a workaround to capture the original traceback in Python 2.7:\n\n1. **Wrap your function with a try-except block**: You can modify your function to catch exceptions and re-raise them with additional context information, including the original traceback.\n\n2. **Use the `traceback` module**: This allows you to capture and format the traceback for your exceptions.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport concurrent.futures\nimport traceback\nimport sys\n\ndef f(x):\n    try:\n        return x * x\n    except Exception as e:\n        # Capture the traceback and re-raise the exception with it\n        tb_str = traceback.format_exc()\n        raise Exception(\"An error occurred in function 'f':\\n\" + tb_str).with_traceback(sys.exc_info()[2])\n\ndata = [1, 2, 3, None, 5]\nwith concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(len(data)) as executor:\n    futures = [executor.submit(f, n) for n in data]\n    for future in futures:\n        try:\n            print(future.result())\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(e)\n```\n\nWith this change, when an exception occurs, the traceback will include the original line in your function `f` where the error happened. This allows you to see the specific line that caused the exception, even when using Python 2.7."
