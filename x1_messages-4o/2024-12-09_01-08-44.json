        "content": "To transpose a list of lists in Python and get a list of lists as the result, you can use the `zip` function in combination with unpacking and the `map` function to convert the tuples produced by `zip` back into lists. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nl = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n\n# Transpose using zip and map\nr = list(map(list, zip(*l)))\n\nprint(r)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `zip(*l)`: The asterisk `*` is used to unpack the original list `l`. `zip` then pairs together elements from each original list at the same index, effectively transposing the data.\n- `map(list, ...)` is used to convert the tuples produced by `zip` into lists.\n- `list(...)` then converts the map object back into a list, giving you the transposed list of lists.\n\nThe output will be as desired:\n```python\n[[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]\n```"
