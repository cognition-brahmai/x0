However, when plotting errorbar plots, matplotlib seems to ignore the rcParams setting for no linestyle. Instead, it's connecting all of the points with a line. Could you help me understand why this is happening and how can I solve this? Is the only solution to explicitly set `linestyle='None'` when calling `pyplot.errorbar()`? Here is a minimal working example:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nlines = {'linestyle': 'None'}\nplt.rc('lines', **lines)\n\nplt.errorbar((0, 1), (1, 0), yerr=(0.1, 0.1), marker='o')\n\nplt.savefig('test.pdf')\nplt.delaxes()\n```\n\nThe result is this plot:\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bHxAL.png)"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to how `matplotlib` handles the `linestyle` parameter for error bars. When using `plt.errorbar()`, the line connecting the data points is controlled by the `linestyle` parameter within the function call itself, and not by the global `rcParams` settings. The `rcParams['lines.linestyle']` setting affects line plots created with `plt.plot()` but does not automatically apply to `plt.errorbar()`.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to explicitly set the `linestyle` to `'None'` when calling `plt.errorbar()`. This ensures that no line is drawn between the points, and only the markers and error bars are displayed. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Set rcParams for lines if needed (though not used for errorbar here)\nlines = {'linestyle': 'None'}\nplt.rc('lines', **lines)\n\n# Explicitly set linestyle to 'None' in errorbar call\nplt.errorbar((0, 1), (1, 0), yerr=(0.1, 0.1), marker='o', linestyle='None')\n\nplt.savefig('test.pdf')\nplt.delaxes()\n```\n\nBy setting `linestyle='None'` directly in the `plt.errorbar()` call, you ensure the plot renders as desired without connecting the data points with lines."
