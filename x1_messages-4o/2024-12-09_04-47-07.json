        "content": "To merge two dictionaries in Python while prioritizing the values from the first dictionary (`d1`) over the second dictionary (`d2`), you can simply update the second dictionary with the contents of the first dictionary. This way, any overlapping keys will retain the values from `d1`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nd3 = d2.copy()  # Create a copy of d2\nd3.update(d1)   # Update d3 with d1, prioritizing d1's values\n```\n\nIn this approach, `d2.copy()` creates a shallow copy of `d2`, and `d3.update(d1)` updates the dictionary `d3` with the key-value pairs from `d1`. Since `update()` will overwrite existing keys with the new ones, the values from `d1` will take precedence over those from `d2` in case of key conflicts."
