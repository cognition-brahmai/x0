The issue I'm facing is that when I run my code, the second function only begins execution after the first one has completed. Here's the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nfrom multiprocessing import Process\n\ndef func1:\n    #does something\n\ndef func2:\n    #does something\n\nif __name__=='__main__':\n    p1 = Process(target = func1)\n    p1.start()\n    p2 = Process(target = func2)\n    p2.start()\n```"

        "content": "The code you provided should generally work for executing two functions simultaneously using the `multiprocessing` module in Python. However, there are a few things to ensure everything works as expected:\n\n1. **Syntax Error**: Make sure that the function definitions include parentheses, even if they don't take any parameters. The correct syntax is `def func1():` and `def func2():`.\n\n2. **Joining Processes**: It's a good practice to join the processes to ensure they complete before the main program exits. This helps in managing the process lifecycle.\n\n3. **Check for Actual Work**: Ensure that both functions `func1` and `func2` have actual work to perform. If they finish too quickly, it may seem like they're not running simultaneously.\n\nHere's the corrected and complete code:\n\n```python\nfrom multiprocessing import Process\n\ndef func1():\n    # does something\n    print(\"Function 1 is running\")\n\ndef func2():\n    # does something\n    print(\"Function 2 is running\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Create process objects\n    p1 = Process(target=func1)\n    p2 = Process(target=func2)\n    \n    # Start the processes\n    p1.start()\n    p2.start()\n    \n    # Wait for the processes to finish\n    p1.join()\n    p2.join()\n    \n    print(\"Both processes have finished execution\")\n```\n\nMake sure to run this script in a script file (e.g., `python script.py`) instead of an interactive environment like Jupyter Notebook, as `multiprocessing` may have issues in such environments."
