However, my current code seems to be running indefinitely and throwing me into an endless loop. Here's the code:\n\n```python\nwhile true:\n    test = 0\n    if test == 5:\n        break\n    test = test - 1\n```\n\nHow can I modify it to stop after 5 minutes if it does not accomplish what I want?"

        "content": "To stop a `while` loop after a certain amount of time, you can use the `time` module in Python. You need to keep track of the start time and continuously check how much time has elapsed. Here's a modified version of your code that stops the loop after 5 minutes:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\nstart_time = time.time()  # Record the start time\n\nwhile True:\n    # Perform your operations here\n    test = 0\n    if test == 5:\n        break\n    test = test - 1\n\n    # Check if 5 minutes have passed\n    elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time\n    if elapsed_time > 5 * 60:  # 5 minutes in seconds\n        print(\"Stopping the loop after 5 minutes\")\n        break\n```\n\nIn this code, the `start_time` is recorded before entering the loop. Inside the loop, after performing the necessary operations, the elapsed time is calculated. If the elapsed time exceeds 5 minutes (300 seconds), the loop breaks and stops executing.\n\nMake sure you have the necessary operations inside the loop, as the current logic with `test` will not achieve much. Adjust the logic as per your requirement."
