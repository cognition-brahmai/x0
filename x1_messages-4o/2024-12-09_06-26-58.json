I think this is due to the complexity of my code. When I try to schedule the .py file directly with Task Scheduler and then run it to check if it works, a window pops up asking me how I would like to open the program. I am using Windows 10 and Python 3.5.2."

        "content": "To schedule a `.py` file using Task Scheduler in Windows 10 without converting it to an `.exe`, you need to make sure Task Scheduler knows how to execute the Python script with the Python interpreter. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:\n\n1. **Locate Python Interpreter Path**:\n   - First, find the path to your Python interpreter. This is typically located in the directory where Python was installed. A common path might be `C:\\Python35\\python.exe` or `C:\\Users\\<YourUsername>\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python35\\python.exe`.\n\n2. **Create a Basic Task in Task Scheduler**:\n   - Open Task Scheduler by searching for it in the Start menu.\n   - Click on \"Create Basic Task...\" in the right-hand panel.\n   - Give your task a name and description, then click \"Next.\"\n\n3. **Set the Trigger**:\n   - Choose when you want the task to start. You can select daily, weekly, one-time, etc., depending on your requirement. Click \"Next\" and set the specific trigger details.\n\n4. **Set the Action**:\n   - Choose \"Start a program\" and click \"Next.\"\n   - In the \"Program/script\" box, enter the path to the Python interpreter, e.g., `C:\\Python35\\python.exe`.\n   - In the \"Add arguments (optional)\" box, enter the path to your `.py` file, e.g., `C:\\Path\\To\\Your\\Script.py`.\n\n5. **Set the Working Directory (Optional)**:\n   - If your script requires a specific working directory, you can set it in the \"Start in (optional)\" field. This is the directory from which the script will run.\n\n6. **Finish the Task Setup**:\n   - Click \"Next\" and review your settings.\n   - Click \"Finish\" to create the task.\n\n7. **Check Task Properties (Optional)**:\n   - After creating the task, you can find it in the Task Scheduler Library.\n   - Right-click on the task, choose \"Properties,\" and adjust any settings such as running the task with highest privileges or setting conditions.\n\n8. **Permissions and Environment**:\n   - Ensure that the account running the task has the necessary permissions to execute the script and access any resources it requires.\n   - If your script requires environment variables or dependencies, make sure they are set up correctly for the user account running the task.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to schedule and run your Python script directly from Task Scheduler without converting it to an `.exe`. If you encounter any issues, double-check the paths and ensure that your Python script runs as expected when executed manually from a command prompt."
