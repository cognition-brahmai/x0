I have attempted to save the results using \n\n```python\ncProfile.run('my_func()','profile_results')\n```\n\nBut the output file is not in a human readable format, even when I tried adding a .txt suffix. How can I save the profiling results to an external file in a human readable format, like a .txt file with all the words properly displayed?"

        "content": "To save the results from `cProfile` in a human-readable format, you can use the `pstats` module to format the profiling data and then write it to a file. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Use `cProfile` to save the raw profile data to a file.\n2. Use `pstats.Stats` to read the raw profile data and print it to a file in a readable format.\n\nHere's a complete example:\n\n```python\nimport cProfile\nimport pstats\n\n# Profile the function and save the raw profile data to a file\npr = cProfile.Profile()\npr.enable()\nmy_func()  # The code you want to profile\npr.disable()\n\n# Save the raw profile data\npr.dump_stats('profile_results.prof')\n\n# Create a Stats object from the raw profile data\nwith open('profile_results.txt', 'w') as f:\n    stats = pstats.Stats('profile_results.prof', stream=f)\n    stats.sort_stats('cumulative')  # Sort the stats by cumulative time\n    stats.print_stats()  # Print the stats to the file\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **cProfile.Profile**: This is used to start and stop the profiling of your code.\n- **dump_stats**: This method saves the raw profiling data to a file ('profile_results.prof' in this case).\n- **pstats.Stats**: This is used to read the raw data and format it.\n- **sort_stats**: You can sort the stats by different criteria like 'cumulative', 'time', 'calls', etc. 'cumulative' is often useful to see which functions consume the most time overall.\n- **print_stats**: This method writes the formatted stats to a file ('profile_results.txt' in this case).\n\nAfter running the above code, you'll have a `profile_results.txt` file containing the profiling results in a human-readable format. You can adjust the sorting criteria and the amount of data printed by modifying the `sort_stats` and `print_stats` calls as needed."
