        "content": "To calculate the experiment status in PHP using the given formula `(total time - elapsed time) / total time`, you can follow these steps. Assume you have the total time and elapsed time stored in the variables `$total_time` and `$elapsed_time`. You want to calculate the status and possibly express it as a percentage.\n\nHere's a simple PHP script that demonstrates how to do this:\n\n```php\n<?php\n\n// Example values for total time and elapsed time\n$total_time = 100; // Total time in seconds (or any other unit)\n$elapsed_time = 40; // Elapsed time in the same unit\n\n// Check if total time is greater than zero to avoid division by zero\nif ($total_time > 0) {\n    // Calculate the experiment status\n    $status = ($total_time - $elapsed_time) / $total_time;\n\n    // Convert the status to a percentage\n    $status_percentage = $status * 100;\n\n    // Output the result\n    echo \"Experiment Status: \" . $status_percentage . \"%\";\n} else {\n    // Handle the case where total time is zero\n    echo \"Total time must be greater than zero.\";\n}\n\n?>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Variables**: `$total_time` and `$elapsed_time` store the total and elapsed time, respectively.\n- **Division Check**: Before performing the division, it's good practice to check if `$total_time` is greater than zero to avoid division by zero errors.\n- **Calculation**: The status is calculated using the formula `(total_time - elapsed_time) / total_time`.\n- **Percentage Conversion**: The result is multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n- **Output**: The result is printed, showing the experiment status as a percentage.\n\nRemember to substitute the example values with your actual data when using this script in your application."
