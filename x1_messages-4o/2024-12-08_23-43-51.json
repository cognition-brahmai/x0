        "content": "Certainly! To retrieve the total sales and average price for each product category from the `products` table, you can use the following SQL query. This query assumes that the 'date_sold' column contains the date when the product was sold.\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    category,\n    COUNT(*) AS total_sales,\n    AVG(price) AS average_price\nFROM \n    products\nWHERE \n    date_sold >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR)\nGROUP BY \n    category;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS total_sales, AVG(price) AS average_price`:** This part of the query selects the `category`, counts the number of sales (`COUNT(*)`), and calculates the average price (`AVG(price)`) for each category.\n  \n- **`FROM products`:** Specifies the table from which to retrieve the data.\n\n- **`WHERE date_sold >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR)`:** Filters the records to include only those sold in the past year. You can adjust this condition according to how your dates are stored.\n\n- **`GROUP BY category`:** Groups the results by product category, allowing the aggregation functions (`COUNT` and `AVG`) to be applied to each category.\n\nMake sure to adjust the query if your database system uses a different syntax for date calculations. The above query is compatible with MySQL. If you're using a different SQL database, you might need to adapt the date filtering part accordingly."
