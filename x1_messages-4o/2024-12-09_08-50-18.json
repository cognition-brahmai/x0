        "content": "To write a SQL query that finds the total number of employees with a salary greater than a specific amount, you can use the `COUNT()` function along with a `WHERE` clause to filter the employees based on the salary condition. Here is an example SQL query assuming you have a table named `employees` with a column `salary`:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS total_employees\nFROM employees\nWHERE salary > specific_amount;\n```\n\nReplace `specific_amount` with the actual salary amount you want to use as a threshold. For instance, if you are looking for employees with a salary greater than 50,000, the query would look like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS total_employees\nFROM employees\nWHERE salary > 50000;\n```\n\nThis query will return the total number of employees whose salary is greater than the specified amount."
