I have the following information: all faces are equilateral triangles, and the sum of the lengths of any two edges is greater than the length of the remaining two edges. Can you provide a formula using the [geometry formula] data type?\nHere is the Go code to calculate the surface area of a tetrahedron with unequal edges:\nfunc surfaceArea(a, b, c, d, e, f float64) float64 {\n    p := (a + b + c + d) / 2.0\n    q := (a + e + f + d) / 2.0\n    r := (b + e + f + c) / 2.0\n    s := (c + e + d + f) / 2.0\n    return math.Sqrt((p-a)*(p-b)*(p-c)*(p-d) +\n        (q-a)*(q-e)*(q-f)*(q-d) +\n        (r-b)*(r-e)*(r-f)*(r-c) +\n        (s-c)*(s-e)*(s-d)*(s-f))\n}\nNote that the function takes six arguments, which are the lengths of the six edges of the tetrahedron. The formula used in the function is based on Heron's formula for the area of a triangle."

        "content": "To calculate the surface area of a tetrahedron with unequal edges using Go, you can use a mathematical method called the Cayley-Menger determinant, which is suitable for calculating the volume of a tetrahedron given its edge lengths. However, since you want the surface area, you'll need to compute the area of each triangular face individually and sum them up.\n\nHere's how you can calculate the surface area of a tetrahedron given its six edges \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), \\(d\\), \\(e\\), and \\(f\\), where:\n\n- \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are the edges meeting at one vertex,\n- \\(d\\), \\(e\\), and \\(f\\) are the opposite edges.\n\nEach triangular face can be calculated using Heron's formula, which requires the semi-perimeter and the side lengths of each triangle.\n\nHere's a Go function that utilizes Heron's formula to calculate the area of each face and then sums them up to get the total surface area:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"math\"\n)\n\n// Heron's formula to calculate triangle area\nfunc triangleArea(x, y, z float64) float64 {\n\ts := (x + y + z) / 2.0\n\treturn math.Sqrt(s * (s - x) * (s - y) * (s - z))\n}\n\n// Calculate surface area of tetrahedron\nfunc surfaceArea(a, b, c, d, e, f float64) float64 {\n\t// Area of each triangular face\n\tareaABC := triangleArea(a, b, c)\n\tareaABD := triangleArea(a, d, e)\n\tareaACD := triangleArea(b, d, f)\n\tareaBCD := triangleArea(c, e, f)\n\n\t// Total surface area\n\treturn areaABC + areaABD + areaACD + areaBCD\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Example edge lengths\n\ta, b, c := 3.0, 4.0, 5.0\n\td, e, f := 6.0, 7.0, 8.0\n\n\t// Calculate surface area\n\tsurfaceArea := surfaceArea(a, b, c, d, e, f)\n\tfmt.Printf(\"Surface Area of Tetrahedron: %.2f\\n\", surfaceArea)\n}\n```\n\nReplace the example edge lengths with your specific values. This function will compute the surface area based on the given edge lengths by calculating the area of each face using Heron's formula and summing them up."
