        "content": "The difference between exothermic and endothermic reactions lies in the way they exchange energy with their surroundings:\n\n1. **Exothermic Reactions:**\n   - **Energy Release:** Exothermic reactions release energy, usually in the form of heat, to the surroundings.\n   - **Temperature Change:** The temperature of the surroundings increases as a result of the reaction.\n   - **Examples:** Combustion of fuels (like burning wood or gasoline), respiration in living organisms, and many oxidation reactions.\n\n2. **Endothermic Reactions:**\n   - **Energy Absorption:** Endothermic reactions absorb energy from the surroundings, usually in the form of heat.\n   - **Temperature Change:** The temperature of the surroundings decreases as the reaction occurs.\n   - **Examples:** Photosynthesis in plants, the melting of ice, and the dissolution of ammonium nitrate in water.\n\nIn summary, exothermic reactions release energy, making the surroundings warmer, while endothermic reactions absorb energy, making the surroundings cooler."
