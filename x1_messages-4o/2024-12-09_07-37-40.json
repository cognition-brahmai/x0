My current code is as follows:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    filehandle = open(filename,\"r\")\nexcept:\n    print(\"Could not open file \" + filename)\n    quit() \n\ntext = filehandle.read()\nfilehandle.close()\n```\nAfter this, I process the text, and then attempt to write to a new file:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    writer = open(output,\"w\")\nexcept:\n    print(\"Could not open file \" + output)\n    quit() \n\n#writer.write(text.decode(\"iso 8859-15\").encode(\"UTF-8\"))\nwriter.write(text)\nwriter.close()\n```\nHowever, the output file is saved in iso 8859-15 format according to my editor, even though the initial input file was in UTF-8. When I uncomment the code that should convert the format, it results in gibberish characters for special characters, such as words with tildes (since the text is in Spanish). How can I correctly save the file in UTF-8 format?"

        "content": "To ensure that your file is read and written in UTF-8 format, you should specify the encoding explicitly when opening both the input and output files. The issue you're encountering is likely due to the fact that Python's `open()` function defaults to a platform-specific encoding if none is specified, and this might not be UTF-8.\n\nHere's a revised version of your code that specifies UTF-8 encoding for both reading and writing:\n\n```python\n# Read the file\ntry:\n    with open(filename, \"r\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as filehandle:\n        text = filehandle.read()\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"Could not open file \" + filename)\n    quit()\n\n# Process the text here if needed\n\n# Write to the new file\ntry:\n    with open(output, \"w\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as writer:\n        writer.write(text)\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"Could not open file \" + output)\n    quit()\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n1. **Encoding Specification:** \n   - Added `encoding=\"utf-8\"` in both `open()` calls to ensure that the file is read and written in UTF-8 format.\n\n2. **Context Managers (`with` statement):**\n   - Used `with` to open files. This automatically handles closing the file, even if an error occurs, making your code cleaner and safer.\n\n3. **Specific Exception Handling:**\n   - Used `FileNotFoundError` to specifically catch errors related to file not being found, which is more precise than a general `except`.\n\nBy specifying the UTF-8 encoding explicitly, you ensure that the file operations are consistent with your desired format, preventing issues with character encoding mismatches."
