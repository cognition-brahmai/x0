        "content": "How can I perform multi-class image classification in Keras? I have tried using the code for dog/cat image classification and I achieved 80% accuracy. I have added one more class (aeroplane) to the train and validation folders and made changes in the following codes by changing binary class_mode to categorical and the loss to categorical_crossentropy. I also changed the output layer from sigmoid to softmax. However, I am encountering the following error: \"ValueError: Error when checking target: expected activation_10 to have shape (None, 1) but got array with shape (16, 3)\". Should I change the training labels to categorical as shown in the code snippet `train_labels = to_categorical(train_labels, num_classes=num_classes)`? I'm not sure what happens here and need help with this issue."

        "content": "It looks like you're on the right track with your changes for multi-class classification. The error you're encountering indicates a mismatch between the expected shape of the output from your model and the shape of your target labels. In multi-class classification, your model should output a probability distribution over the number of classes you have. Let's go through the necessary steps to ensure everything is set up correctly:\n\n1. **Change the Final Layer**: You've already changed the final activation from `sigmoid` to `softmax`, which is correct for multi-class classification. Ensure your output layer has the same number of units as the number of classes. For three classes, it should be something like:\n\n   ```python\n   model.add(Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax'))\n   ```\n\n2. **Use Categorical Crossentropy Loss**: You've correctly switched to `categorical_crossentropy` as the loss function, which is appropriate for multi-class classification.\n\n3. **Label Encoding**: Convert your labels to a one-hot encoded format using `to_categorical`. This is crucial because `categorical_crossentropy` expects the labels to be one-hot encoded. So, yes, you should modify your training labels with:\n   \n   ```python\n   train_labels = to_categorical(train_labels, num_classes=num_classes)\n   validation_labels = to_categorical(validation_labels, num_classes=num_classes)\n   ```\n\n   If you're using Keras' `ImageDataGenerator` for data loading, it automatically handles this if you set `class_mode='categorical'`.\n\n4. **Data Generators**: When using `ImageDataGenerator`, make sure you set `class_mode='categorical'`:\n\n   ```python\n   train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)\n   train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(\n       'train',\n       target_size=(img_height, img_width),\n       batch_size=batch_size,\n       class_mode='categorical')  # Ensure this is 'categorical'\n   ```\n\n5. **Model Compilation**: When compiling your model, ensure you specify the number of classes and use the appropriate optimizer:\n\n   ```python\n   model.compile(optimizer='adam',\n                 loss='categorical_crossentropy',\n                 metrics=['accuracy'])\n   ```\n\n6. **Check Input Shape**: Double-check that the input shape of your model matches the input size of your images, and ensure your data generator resizes images accordingly.\n\nBy following these steps, your setup should be correct for handling multi-class classification. If you still encounter issues, double-check that every aspect of your data preparation and model architecture aligns with these guidelines."
