I want to create a pool of threads, assign different tasks to each, and then retrieve the results when all tasks have completed. I've attempted to achieve this with the following code, but I'm unable to get the results. What should I do?\n\nHere is the code I've written:\n\n```python\nfrom threading import Thread\nfrom Queue import Queue\n\nclass Worker(Thread):\n    \"\"\"Thread executing tasks from a given tasks queue\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, tasks):\n        Thread.__init__(self)\n        self.tasks = tasks\n        self.daemon = True\n        self.result = None\n        self.start()\n    def run(self):\n        while True:\n            func, args, kargs = self.tasks.get()\n            try:\n                self.result = func(*args, **kargs)\n            except Exception, e:\n                print e\n            self.tasks.task_done()\n    def get_result(self):\n        return self.result\n\nclass ThreadPool:\n    \"\"\"Pool of threads consuming tasks from a queue\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, num_threads):\n        self.tasks = Queue(num_threads)\n        self.results = []\n        for _ in range(num_threads):\n            w = Worker(self.tasks)\n            self.results.append(w.get_result())\n    def add_task(self, func, *args, **kargs):\n        \"\"\"Add a task to the queue\"\"\"\n        self.tasks.put((func, args, kargs))\n    def wait_completion(self):\n        \"\"\"Wait for completion of all the tasks in the queue\"\"\"\n        self.tasks.join()\n    def get_results(self):\n        return self.results\n\ndef foo(word, number):\n    print word*number\n    return number\n\nwords = ['hello', 'world', 'test', 'word', 'another test']\nnumbers = [1,2,3,4,5]\npool = ThreadPool(5)\nfor i in range(0, len(words)):\n    pool.add_task(foo, words[i], numbers[i])\n\npool.wait_completion()\nresults = pool.get_results()\nprint results\n```\n\nThe output prints the strings with the given word times the given number, but the results list is filled with None values. How can I obtain the return values from the functions?\n\nAlternatively, can I create a list when filling the Queue, add a dictionary or some variable to store the result as an argument to my function, and after the task is added to the Queue, add this result argument to a list of results?\n\nHere is the alternative code:\n\n```python\ndef foo(word, number, r):\n    print word*number\n    r[(word,number)] = number\n    return number\n\nwords = ['hello', 'world', 'test', 'word', 'another test']\nnumbers = [1,2,3,4,5]\npool = ThreadPool(5)\nresults = []\nfor i in range(0, len(words)):\n    r = {}\n    pool.add_task(foo, words[i], numbers[i], r)\n    results.append(r)\nprint results\n```"

        "content": "To effectively retrieve results from a pool of threads in Python, you can utilize a shared queue to store the results. This approach will ensure that each worker thread can place its result into this queue after it completes its task. Below are the modifications you need to make to your existing code:\n\n### Approach with a Result Queue\n\n1. **Use a result queue**: Create a separate queue for results. Each thread will put its result into this queue.\n\n2. **Modify the Worker class**: Instead of storing the result in a member variable of the `Worker` class, put it into the result queue.\n\n3. **Collect results after all tasks are completed**: After calling `wait_completion()`, retrieve all results from the result queue.\n\nHere's the updated code with these changes:\n\n```python\nfrom threading import Thread\nfrom Queue import Queue\n\nclass Worker(Thread):\n    \"\"\"Thread executing tasks from a given tasks queue\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, tasks, result_queue):\n        Thread.__init__(self)\n        self.tasks = tasks\n        self.result_queue = result_queue\n        self.daemon = True\n        self.start()\n\n    def run(self):\n        while True:\n            func, args, kargs = self.tasks.get()\n            try:\n                result = func(*args, **kargs)\n                self.result_queue.put(result)  # Put the result into the result queue\n            except Exception as e:\n                print(e)\n            self.tasks.task_done()\n\nclass ThreadPool:\n    \"\"\"Pool of threads consuming tasks from a queue\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, num_threads):\n        self.tasks = Queue(num_threads)\n        self.result_queue = Queue()  # Create a queue for results\n        for _ in range(num_threads):\n            Worker(self.tasks, self.result_queue)\n\n    def add_task(self, func, *args, **kargs):\n        \"\"\"Add a task to the queue\"\"\"\n        self.tasks.put((func, args, kargs))\n\n    def wait_completion(self):\n        \"\"\"Wait for completion of all the tasks in the queue\"\"\"\n        self.tasks.join()\n\n    def get_results(self):\n        results = []\n        while not self.result_queue.empty():\n            results.append(self.result_queue.get())\n        return results\n\ndef foo(word, number):\n    print(word * number)\n    return number\n\nwords = ['hello', 'world', 'test', 'word', 'another test']\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\npool = ThreadPool(5)\nfor i in range(len(words)):\n    pool.add_task(foo, words[i], numbers[i])\n\npool.wait_completion()\nresults = pool.get_results()\nprint(results)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Result Queue**: The `result_queue` is passed to each `Worker` and is used to store results from each task.\n- **Collecting Results**: After all tasks are completed, results can be collected from the `result_queue`.\n- **Thread Safety**: The `Queue` class in Python is thread-safe, which makes it suitable for communication between threads.\n\nThis implementation should give you a list of results corresponding to each task after all the tasks have completed."
