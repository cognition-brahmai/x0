I have successfully calculated ranking probabilities for multiple queries. Now, I need to calculate the nDCG for the test set, for which I intend to use sklearn's nDCG function. The example given on the link is as follows:\n\n```python\n>>> y_true = [1, 0, 2]\n>>> y_score = [[0.15, 0.55, 0.2], [0.7, 0.2, 0.1], [0.06, 0.04, 0.9]]\n>>> ndcg_score(y_true, y_score, k=2)\n1.0\n```\n\nIn this case, y_true is the ground truth and y_score are the probabilities. I have several questions regarding this example:\n\n1. Does this example pertain to just one query or multiple queries?\n2. If the example is for just one query, what does y_true represent\u2014is it the original rankings?\n3. Why are there multiple input probabilities if this is for a single query?\n4. How can I apply this method to multiple queries and their resultant probabilities?"

        "content": "Let's break down your questions one by one to clarify how to use the `ndcg_score` function in `sklearn`.\n\n1. **One Query or Multiple Queries?**\n   - The example given pertains to multiple queries. Each sub-array in `y_score` corresponds to a set of scores for a different query.\n\n2. **What Does y_true Represent?**\n   - In this context, `y_true` represents the true relevance scores for each item across all queries. Each element in `y_true` corresponds to a query, and the value indicates the relevance (such as 0 for not relevant, 1 for relevant, and higher values for more relevance).\n\n3. **Multiple Input Probabilities for a Single Query?**\n   - The `y_score` is a list of lists where each sublist contains the predicted scores (or probabilities) for the items in a particular query. Each query is represented by its own sublist. The length of each sublist should match the number of items in the query.\n\n4. **Applying the Method to Multiple Queries:**\n   - To apply the `ndcg_score` method to multiple queries, you should organize your true relevance scores and predicted scores similarly to the example. Here's how you might structure your data:\n     - `y_true` should be an array of arrays (or a 2D list) where each sub-array corresponds to the true relevance scores of items for a single query.\n     - `y_score` should be a 2D array (list of lists) where each sub-array corresponds to the predicted scores for the same items in the corresponding query from `y_true`.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how you might apply this to multiple queries:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.metrics import ndcg_score\n\n# Ground truth relevance scores for 3 queries\ny_true = [\n    [3, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2],  # Relevance scores for query 1\n    [2, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1],  # Relevance scores for query 2\n    [3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 0]   # Relevance scores for query 3\n]\n\n# Predicted scores for 3 queries\ny_score = [\n    [0.1, 0.4, 0.35, 0.8, 0.2, 0.5],  # Predicted scores for query 1\n    [0.3, 0.8, 0.2, 0.5, 0.7, 0.6],  # Predicted scores for query 2\n    [0.9, 0.6, 0.4, 0.5, 0.3, 0.2]   # Predicted scores for query 3\n]\n\n# Calculate nDCG for each query and average them\nndcg = ndcg_score(y_true, y_score, k=5)\nprint(ndcg)\n```\n\nIn this example, `y_true` and `y_score` are structured to handle multiple queries, with each sublist corresponding to a query. The `ndcg_score` function can compute the nDCG for each query and return the average nDCG score over all queries. Adjust `k` to specify how many top results you want to consider for the calculation."
