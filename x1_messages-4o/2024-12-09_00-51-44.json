I tried feeding a list into the delete method but nothing gets deleted. For example:\n\n```python\nfrom common.redis_client import get_redis_client\ncache = get_redis_client()\nx = cache.keys('prefix:*') \n\nx == ['prefix:key1','prefix:key2'] # True\n\ncache.delete(x) # returns 0, nothing is deleted\n```\n\nI understand that I could iterate over the keys and delete them one by one as in:\n\n```python\nfor key in x:\n   cache.delete(key)\n```\n\nHowever, I would like to avoid this approach in order to benefit from Redis's speed and capabilities. Is there a pythonic solution to this problem using py-redis, without iteration or using the command-line interface?"

        "content": "To delete all keys in Redis that match a specific pattern efficiently using Python and `redis-py`, you can use the `unlink` method. This method is non-blocking and removes the keys asynchronously, which is generally faster and preferable over `delete` for large numbers of keys. However, you still need to collect the keys that match your pattern, but you can then pass all of them at once to `unlink`.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom common.redis_client import get_redis_client\n\ncache = get_redis_client()\n\n# Get all keys matching the pattern\nkeys_to_delete = cache.keys('prefix:*')\n\nif keys_to_delete:\n    # Use the unlink method which is non-blocking\n    cache.unlink(*keys_to_delete)\n```\n\nNote that you can pass multiple keys to the `unlink` method using the unpacking operator `*`. This will delete the keys in an asynchronous manner, allowing Redis to handle the deletion more efficiently in the background.\n\nIf your Redis version does not support `unlink` (Redis 4.0 and later), you can still use the `delete` method with unpacked keys, but it will be blocking:\n\n```python\nif keys_to_delete:\n    cache.delete(*keys_to_delete)\n```\n\nKeep in mind that both `unlink` and `delete` have limitations on the number of keys you can pass at once, so for extremely large datasets, you might still need to batch the deletions in chunks."
