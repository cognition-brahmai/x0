I used the following code:\n\n```python\nletters=['a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h','i','j','k','l']\nfor i in letters:\n    letters.remove(i)\nprint letters\n```\n\nHowever, the last print statement shows that not all items were removed and only alternate items were deleted. The output is as follows:\n\n```python\nIDLE 2.6.2      \n>>> ================================ RESTART ================================\n>>> \n['b', 'd', 'f', 'h', 'j', 'l']\n>>> \n```\n\nCan someone explain why this is happening and how I can modify my code to remove every item from the list?"

        "content": "The behavior you're encountering is due to the way you're modifying the list while iterating over it. When you remove an item from the list inside the loop, the indices of the remaining items are shifted, which causes the loop to skip the next item.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of what happens in your loop:\n\n1. The loop starts at index 0, with `i` as `'a'`. It removes `'a'`, and the list becomes `['b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l']`.\n2. The next iteration picks the element at index 1, which is now `'c'`, because the list has been shifted after removing `'a'`. It removes `'c'`, and the list becomes `['b', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l']`.\n3. This process continues, skipping every other element.\n\nTo solve this issue, you can iterate over a copy of the list while modifying the original list. Here's one way to do it:\n\n```python\nletters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l']\nfor i in letters[:]:  # Create a shallow copy of the list using slicing\n    letters.remove(i)\nprint(letters)\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `clear()` method in Python 3.3 and above to empty the list:\n\n```python\nletters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l']\nletters.clear()  # This removes all elements from the list\nprint(letters)\n```\n\nEither of these approaches will give you the desired result of an empty list."
