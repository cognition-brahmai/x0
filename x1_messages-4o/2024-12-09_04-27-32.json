        "content": "I am trying to implement Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) functions in CUDA C++ device code and I am currently working on the left bytewise rotate operator. However, I found there is no native SIMD intrinsic for this operation. I tried to implement it myself, but my solution seems to be inefficient due to expensive unpacking/packing. Here's my code:\n\n```cpp\n__inline__ __device__ uint32_t per_byte_bit_left_rotate(uint32_t input, uint8_t amount) {\n    return ((((input & 0xFF) >> 0) << amount) | (((input & 0xFF) >> 0) >> 7) & ~0x100) << 0 |\n         ((((input & 0xFF00) >> 8) << amount) | ((input & 0xFF00 >> 8) >> 7) & ~0x100) << 8 |\n         ((((input & 0xFF0000) >> 16) << amount) | ((input & 0xFF0000 >> 16) >> 7) & ~0x100) << 16 |\n         ((((input & 0xFF000000) >> 24) << amount) | ((input & 0xFF000000 >> 24) >> 7) & ~0x100) << 24; \n}\n```\n\nCan someone suggest a way to do a per byte bit rotate operation that is at least somewhat efficient?"

        "content": "To optimize the per-byte bitwise left rotation in CUDA, you can leverage bitwise operations to avoid the expensive unpacking and packing. Here is an optimized version of your function:\n\n```cpp\n__inline__ __device__ uint32_t per_byte_bit_left_rotate(uint32_t input, uint8_t amount) {\n    // Ensure the rotation amount is within a single byte (0-7)\n    amount %= 8;\n\n    // Rotate each byte individually and combine them back\n    uint32_t result = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {\n        uint8_t byte = (input >> (i * 8)) & 0xFF; // Extract the byte\n        uint8_t rotated_byte = (byte << amount) | (byte >> (8 - amount)); // Rotate the byte\n        result |= (rotated_byte << (i * 8)); // Place the rotated byte back\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Byte Extraction**: The loop extracts each byte from the 32-bit `input` using bit shifting and masking `(input >> (i * 8)) & 0xFF`.\n\n2. **Rotation**: The rotation of each byte is achieved using `(byte << amount) | (byte >> (8 - amount))`, which first shifts the bits left and then wraps around the bits shifted out by doing a right shift by the complement of the amount.\n\n3. **Assembly**: The rotated bytes are combined back into a 32-bit result using bitwise OR and proper shifting `(rotated_byte << (i * 8))`.\n\nThis implementation should be more efficient, as it avoids the complex unpacking and packing of the bitwise operations. Also, ensure that the rotation amount is between 0 and 7 to handle cases where the input might exceed the byte boundaries."
