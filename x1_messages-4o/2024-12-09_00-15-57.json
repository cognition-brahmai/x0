I was able to do this in the older version (0.6.4) using 'app_visible' argument in Workbook constructor. But in the new version (0.9.2), Workbook has been replaced by Book and I can't find a similar option. I tried using the App object's 'visible' attribute and set it to False, but when I open the book, 'visible' becomes True and the book is shown. Here's my current code:\n\n```python\nimport xlwings as xw\n\napp = xw.App(visible=False)\nfilename = os.path.join(PATH_EXCEL_SAMPLES, r\"rangosConDatos_sample01.xls\")\nbook = xw.Book(filename)\n# Do stuff with the info in the book\nbook.close()  # Ya puedo cerrar el libro.\napp.kill()\n```\n\nIs this a feature or a bug? How can I open the book without showing it?"

        "content": "In xlwings version 0.9.2 and later, opening a workbook without making it visible can be achieved by ensuring that the `App` object is correctly configured before opening the book. The behavior you're experiencing might be due to the workbook being visible by default when it's opened, even if the `App` is set to not be visible.\n\nYou can address this by reassigning the `visible` attribute of the `App` object after opening the workbook. Here\u2019s how you can modify your code to ensure the workbook remains invisible:\n\n```python\nimport xlwings as xw\nimport os\n\n# Initialize the app with visibility set to False\napp = xw.App(visible=False)\n\n# Specify the path to your Excel file\nfilename = os.path.join(PATH_EXCEL_SAMPLES, r\"rangosConDatos_sample01.xls\")\n\n# Open the workbook\nbook = xw.Book(filename)\n\n# Re-ensure the app's visibility is False after opening the book\napp.visible = False\n\n# Perform operations on the workbook\n# ...\n\n# Close the workbook and kill the app\nbook.close()\napp.kill()\n```\n\nMake sure to re-assign `app.visible = False` immediately after opening the workbook to ensure that the application remains hidden. This approach should help in maintaining the workbook's invisibility while you perform operations on it."
