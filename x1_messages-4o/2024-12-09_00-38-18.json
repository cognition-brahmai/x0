I want to inherit from it and \"bind\" another metaclass so it won't overshadow the original one. Can I chain them like mixins without explicit subclassing? My goal is to create a mechanism for hooking into the process of `Model`, `Form`, etc. definitions in Django so it can be changed at runtime."

        "content": "Chaining metaclasses in Python is not straightforward because a class can only have one metaclass. However, you can achieve a similar effect by creating a custom metaclass that combines the behavior of multiple metaclasses. This approach requires explicitly defining a new metaclass that inherits from the metaclasses you want to chain.\n\nHere's a guide on how you can create a combined metaclass:\n\n1. **Identify the Metaclasses**: Determine which metaclasses you want to combine. For instance, if you have `ModelBase` and another metaclass, say `CustomMeta`, you need to combine them.\n\n2. **Create a Combined Metaclass**: Define a new metaclass that inherits from both `ModelBase` and `CustomMeta`. The order of inheritance is important because it determines the method resolution order (MRO).\n\n3. **Override the `__new__` or `__init__` Methods**: You may need to override the `__new__` or `__init__` methods of the combined metaclass to ensure that both metaclasses' logic gets executed. Call the super method to ensure each parent metaclass's logic is executed.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```python\nclass ModelBase(type):\n    def __new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace):\n        print(\"ModelBase __new__\")\n        cls = super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace)\n        # Put ModelBase specific logic here\n        return cls\n\nclass CustomMeta(type):\n    def __new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace):\n        print(\"CustomMeta __new__\")\n        cls = super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace)\n        # Put CustomMeta specific logic here\n        return cls\n\nclass CombinedMeta(ModelBase, CustomMeta):\n    def __new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace):\n        print(\"CombinedMeta __new__\")\n        cls = super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace)\n        return cls\n\nclass MyModel(metaclass=CombinedMeta):\n    pass\n\n# Example usage\nmy_model_instance = MyModel()\n```\n\nIn this example, the `CombinedMeta` class inherits from both `ModelBase` and `CustomMeta`, and the `__new__` method is used to call the logic in both parent metaclasses. When you create an instance of `MyModel`, it will print messages from each metaclass to demonstrate the chaining effect.\n\nBy using this approach, you can effectively combine and execute the behaviors of multiple metaclasses in your class definitions. This is a powerful technique for customizing class creation and behavior in Python, especially in complex frameworks like Django."
