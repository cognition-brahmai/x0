The \"aux\" option shows all processes, including those of other users, with more detailed information. The \"--sort=-%mem\" option sorts the processes by memory usage in descending order. The \"head -n 11\" option shows only the top 10 results, excluding the header row."

Since the `ps aux` command includes a header row, this effectively shows the top 10 processes by memory usage.\n\nSo, the command is correctly displaying the top 10 memory-consuming processes along with the header."
