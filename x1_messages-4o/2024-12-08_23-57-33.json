The code must not contain any repeating characters and should be unique within the database. Additionally, please provide the code in both ASCII and Unicode formats, and include a table displaying the code along with the customer's name, contact information, and any relevant purchase history. Furthermore, ensure that the code is securely stored and encrypted using the AES-256 algorithm. Finally, provide detailed instructions for how to deliver the code to the customer, including any necessary authentication measures and potential delivery methods such as email or SMS."

        "content": "Generating a unique alphanumeric code and ensuring its secure storage involves several steps. Let's go through the whole process:\n\n### Step 1: Generate a Random Alphanumeric Code\nTo create a 10-character alphanumeric code without repeating characters, we can use a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numbers. Here's a sample code:\n\n#### Sample Code\n```\nCode: G7a4J9kLmX\n```\n\n### Step 2: Represent the Code in ASCII and Unicode\n- **ASCII Representation:** Each character is represented by its ASCII value.\n  - G: 71, 7: 55, a: 97, 4: 52, J: 74, 9: 57, k: 107, L: 76, m: 109, X: 88\n- **Unicode Representation:** Similar to ASCII in this context as the characters are within the ASCII range.\n  - G: U+0047, 7: U+0037, a: U+0061, 4: U+0034, J: U+004A, 9: U+0039, k: U+006B, L: U+004C, m: U+006D, X: U+0058\n\n### Step 3: Create a Table for Customer Details\n\n| Customer Name | Contact Information | Purchase History       | Code       |\n|---------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------|\n| Sarah Howard  | sarah@example.com    | Product A, Product B   | G7a4J9kLmX |\n\n### Step 4: Securely Store the Code\nTo store the code securely, it should be encrypted using AES-256. Here's a simplified explanation of how you might do this:\n1. **Generate an AES-256 Key:** Use a secure method to generate a 256-bit key.\n2. **Encrypt the Code:**\n   - Use a cryptographic library to encrypt the code with the generated key.\n   - Store both the encrypted code and the key securely.\n3. **Example** (In Practice, Use a Library for Implementation):\n   ```python\n   from Crypto.Cipher import AES\n   import os\n\n   # Generate a random AES-256 key\n   key = os.urandom(32)  # 256 bits\n\n   # Encrypt the code\n   cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_EAX)\n   nonce = cipher.nonce\n   ciphertext, tag = cipher.encrypt_and_digest(b'G7a4J9kLmX')\n\n   # Save nonce, ciphertext, and key securely\n   ```\n\n### Step 5: Deliver the Code\nTo deliver the code to Sarah Howard securely, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Authenticate the Customer:**\n   - Verify Sarah's identity using a security question or a two-factor authentication method.\n\n2. **Possible Delivery Methods:**\n   - **Email:** Send an email to sarah@example.com with the code. Use end-to-end encryption if possible.\n   - **SMS:** Send the code via SMS to her registered mobile number, ensuring secure transmission.\n   - **Secure Portal:** Allow her to log into a secure portal to view the code.\n\n3. **Include Instructions:**\n   - Explain how to use the code.\n   - Advise keeping the code confidential and provide a contact for support if needed.\n\n4. **Log Delivery:**\n   - Record the delivery details (method and timestamp) for future reference.\n\n### Note\nEnsure that all cryptographic operations are performed using a well-reviewed library or tool to avoid security pitfalls. Additionally, always comply with data protection regulations when handling personal data."
