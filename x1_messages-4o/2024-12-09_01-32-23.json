        "content": "Validating email addresses with regular expressions can be quite tricky due to the wide variety of valid email formats allowed by the specification. However, for most practical purposes, you can use a regex that handles the majority of common email formats, including those from subdomains.\n\nHere\u2019s a regex pattern that should cover most typical cases, including subdomains:\n\n```regex\n^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$\n```\n\n### Explanation of the regex:\n\n- `^` and `$`: These denote the start and end of the string, ensuring the entire string is evaluated.\n- `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+`: Matches the local part of the email before the `@` sign. It allows alphanumeric characters and some special characters like `.`, `_`, `%`, `+`, and `-`.\n- `@`: Matches the `@` symbol.\n- `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+`: Matches the domain part. This allows alphanumeric characters, as well as `.` and `-`, and permits multiple subdomains (e.g., `mail.example.co.in`).\n- `\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}`: Ensures that the domain ends with a dot followed by at least two alphabetic characters, which covers common top-level domains (TLDs).\n\n### Notes:\n\n1. **Limitations**: This regex will not match every possible valid email address according to the official specifications (RFC 5322). It is, however, a good balance between complexity and practicality for most applications.\n   \n2. **Unicode Domains**: If you want to support internationalized domain names (IDNs), you'll need a more complex regex or additional logic to handle those cases, since this basic pattern only supports ASCII characters.\n\n3. **Further Validation**: While regex can catch many invalid formats, it can't verify that the domain part of an email actually exists or that the email is deliverable. For further validation, you might want to implement additional checks, such as sending a verification email.\n\n4. **Testing**: Always test your regex with a variety of email addresses to ensure it behaves as expected.\n\nBy using this regex in your form input validation, you should be able to handle most common scenarios, including emails from subdomains."
