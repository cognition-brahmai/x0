The warning I'm getting is:\n\n```\n/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/unittest/case.py:601:\nResourceWarning: unclosed socket.socket fd=4, \nfamily=AddressFamily.AF_INET, type=SocketKind.SOCK_STREAM, proto=6, \nladdr=('1.1.2.3', 65087), raddr=('5.8.13.21', 8080)\n```\n\nI found out that this is also happening with popular libraries like requests and boto3. I could ignore the warning or filter it completely. If this was my service, I could set the connection: close header in my response.\n\nHere's an example code in Python 3.6.1 that shows the warning:\n\napp.py\n```\nimport requests\n\nclass Service(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.session = requests.Session()\n\n    def get_info(self):\n        uri = 'http://api.stackexchange.com/2.2/info?site=stackoverflow'\n        response = self.session.get(uri)\n        if response.status_code == 200:\n            return response.json()\n        else:\n            response.raise_for_status()\n\n    def __del__(self):\n        self.session.close()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    service = Service()\n    print(service.get_info())\n```\n\ntest.py\n```\nimport unittest\n\nclass TestService(unittest.TestCase):\n    def test_growing(self):\n        import app\n        service = app.Service()\n        res = service.get_info()\n        self.assertTrue(res['items'][0]['new_active_users'] > 1)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\nIs there a better or correct way to manage the session so that it gets explicitly closed and not rely on __del__() to avoid this warning?"

        "content": "Yes, relying on the `__del__()` method to close resources like sockets is generally not recommended because it's not guaranteed when or even if `__del__()` will be called, as it depends on the garbage collection process. Instead, you should use a context manager to ensure that resources are properly managed and closed.\n\nIn Python, you can make use of the `with` statement to handle this more gracefully. You can modify your `Service` class to implement the context manager protocol by adding `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\nclass Service(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.session = requests.Session()\n\n    def get_info(self):\n        uri = 'http://api.stackexchange.com/2.2/info?site=stackoverflow'\n        response = self.session.get(uri)\n        if response.status_code == 200:\n            return response.json()\n        else:\n            response.raise_for_status()\n\n    def __enter__(self):\n        # Nothing special to do when entering the context\n        return self\n\n    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):\n        # Ensure the session is closed when exiting the context\n        self.session.close()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    with Service() as service:\n        print(service.get_info())\n```\n\nAnd in your test code, you can use the `with` statement to ensure the session is managed correctly:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\nimport app\n\nclass TestService(unittest.TestCase):\n    def test_growing(self):\n        with app.Service() as service:\n            res = service.get_info()\n            self.assertTrue(res['items'][0]['new_active_users'] > 1)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\nThis modification ensures that the session is always closed when the `Service` object is done being used, helping to prevent any unclosed resource warnings."
