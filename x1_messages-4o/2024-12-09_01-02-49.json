        "content": "Your function can indeed be improved for efficiency and Pythonic style. The most idiomatic way to convert a list of tuples into a list of lists in Python is to use a list comprehension. This approach is more concise and typically more efficient. Here's how you can refactor your function:\n\n```python\ndef get_list_of_lists(list_of_tuples):\n    return [list(t) for t in list_of_tuples]\n```\n\nThis single line of code uses a list comprehension to iterate over each tuple in `list_of_tuples`, converts each tuple to a list with `list(t)`, and constructs a new list from those lists. It achieves the same result as your original function but in a more concise and Pythonic way."
