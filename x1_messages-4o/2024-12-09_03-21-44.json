My dataframe is large and has a variety of data types including strings, floats, dates, NaN's, booleans, and integers. When I try to execute `df = db.drop_duplicates()`, I get a TypeError with a message, \"unhashable type: 'list'\". How can I resolve this issue and successfully remove duplicate rows from my dataframe?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"unhashable type: 'list'\", typically arises when there are columns in your DataFrame that contain list-like objects. The `drop_duplicates` method requires the data in each row to be hashable, which is not the case for lists. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Identify List Columns**: First, identify which columns in your DataFrame contain list-like objects. You can do this by using `applymap` to check the type of each element:\n\n    ```python\n    list_columns = [col for col in df.columns if df[col].apply(lambda x: isinstance(x, list)).any()]\n    print(\"Columns with list-like objects:\", list_columns)\n    ```\n\n2. **Convert Lists to Strings**: If it makes sense for your data, you can convert these list-like objects into strings, which are hashable:\n\n    ```python\n    for col in list_columns:\n        df[col] = df[col].apply(lambda x: str(x) if isinstance(x, list) else x)\n    ```\n\n3. **Handle Lists Appropriately**: If converting to strings isn't suitable (for example, if you need to preserve the list structure), you might consider flattening or otherwise transforming these columns in a way that suits your analysis.\n\n4. **Drop Duplicates**: Once you've handled the list columns, you should be able to use `drop_duplicates` without encountering the error:\n\n    ```python\n    df = df.drop_duplicates()\n    ```\n\n5. **Consider Other Data Types**: Ensure that other complex data types, such as dictionaries, are also handled appropriately if they exist in your DataFrame.\n\nBy addressing the unhashable types in your DataFrame, you should be able to successfully remove duplicate rows using `drop_duplicates`."
