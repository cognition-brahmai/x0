I want to append this integer to my byte sequence, so it would look like this: `b'\\x01\\x02\\x03\\x05'`. However, I'm having trouble figuring out how to do this because the `bytes` type doesn't seem to have an `append` method and I'm not sure how to turn my integer into a single byte. When I tried `bytes(5)`, it returned `b'\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00'`."

        "content": "To append an integer (in the range 0 to 255) to a byte sequence in Python, you can convert the integer to a single byte using the `bytes` or `bytearray` constructor. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Use the `+` operator to concatenate the byte sequence with the integer converted to a byte.\n\n2. You can convert the integer to a byte using the `bytes` constructor by passing a list containing the integer, or using the `bytes` method to convert directly.\n\nHere's an example of how to achieve this:\n\n```python\n# Original byte sequence\nbyte_sequence = b'\\x01\\x02\\x03'\n\n# Integer to append\ninteger_to_append = 5\n\n# Convert the integer to bytes and concatenate\nnew_byte_sequence = byte_sequence + bytes([integer_to_append])\n\n# Display the result\nprint(new_byte_sequence)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, `new_byte_sequence` will be `b'\\x01\\x02\\x03\\x05'`, which is the byte sequence with the integer appended. The key part here is using `bytes([integer_to_append])`, which creates a bytes object containing the single byte representation of the integer."
