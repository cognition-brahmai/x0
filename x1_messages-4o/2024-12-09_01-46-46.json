        "content": "Yes, you can use the `pandas` library, which is quite powerful and can handle CSV data from strings easily. Here's how you can do it using `pandas`:\n\nFirst, ensure you have `pandas` installed. If not, you can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install pandas\n```\n\nThen, you can use the `pandas.read_csv` function along with `io.StringIO` to read a CSV string as if it were a file:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom io import StringIO\n\ncsv_string = \"\"\"name,age,city\nJohn,23,New York\nAnna,30,Los Angeles\nMike,22,Chicago\"\"\"\n\n# Use StringIO to convert the string into a file-like object\ncsv_data = StringIO(csv_string)\n\n# Use pandas to read the CSV data\ndf = pd.read_csv(csv_data)\n\n# Convert DataFrame to a list of dictionaries\ndata_list_of_dicts = df.to_dict(orient='records')\n\n# Or convert to a dictionary with columns as keys\ndata_dict_of_columns = df.to_dict(orient='list')\n\n# Output the results\nprint(data_list_of_dicts)\nprint(data_dict_of_columns)\n```\n\nThe above code will convert the CSV string into a Pandas DataFrame and then into a list of dictionaries or a dictionary of columns, depending on your needs. `pandas` is very versatile and can handle various CSV nuances, making it a good choice for handling CSV data in Python."
