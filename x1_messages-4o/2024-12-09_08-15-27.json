I wrote the following code:\n```python\nprint True                    # outputs true\nTrue = False;    print True   # outputs false\nTrue = True;     print True   # outputs false\nTrue = not True; print True   # outputs true\n```\nThe output seemed bizarre as it didn't match my expectations. I suspect it might be related to Python's object model but I'm not certain. Could anyone explain this behaviour?"

        "content": "In Python 2.5.2, `True` and `False` are not keywords, but rather built-in names that can be reassigned. This is why your code behaves the way it does. The names `True` and `False` are essentially just variables that initially point to the boolean values `1` (for `True`) and `0` (for `False`).\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening in your code:\n\n1. `print True` initially outputs `True` because `True` is initially set to the boolean value `1`, which is considered `True`.\n\n2. When you do `True = False`, you are reassigning the name `True` to point to the boolean value `0`, which is considered `False`. Therefore, `print True` outputs `False`.\n\n3. Reassigning `True = True` doesn't change the situation because you have already altered the `True` identifier to point to `False` in the previous line. `print True` still outputs `False` because `True` is now pointing to `False`.\n\n4. When you do `True = not True`, it evaluates `not False`, which results in `True`. Thus, `print True` outputs `True`.\n\nThis behavior was changed in Python 3, where `True` and `False` became proper keywords and cannot be reassigned. If you're working with older Python versions like 2.5.2, it's important to be cautious with such reassignments as they can lead to confusing and hard-to-debug code."
