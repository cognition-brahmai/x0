I believe the problem might have something to do with the `return redirect(url_for('database'))` line of my code. Even after trying `return render_template('database.html)`, the issue persists. I'm trying to redirect to the database page after form data has been submitted. The relevant sections of my code are provided below. Can you help me resolve this error?\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```\n@app.route('/entry', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef entry_page():\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        date = request.form['date']\n        title = request.form['blog_title']\n        post = request.form['blog_main']\n        post_entry = models.BlogPost(date = date, title = title, post = post)\n        db.session.add(post_entry)\n        db.session.commit()\n        return redirect(url_for('database'))\n    else:\n        return render_template('entry.html')\n\n@app.route('/database')        \ndef database():\n    query = []\n    for i in session.query(models.BlogPost):\n        query.append((i.title, i.post, i.date))\n    return render_template('database.html', query = query)\n```\n\nHere is the entry.html:\n\n```\nTHIS IS THE BLOG ENTRY PAGE\n\nblog:\n<html>\n    <form action='/database' method = \"post\">\n        date<input name = \"date\" type = \"text\" class=\"text\">\n        title<input name = \"blog_title\" type = \"text\" class=\"text\">\n        main<input name = \"blog_main\" type = \"text\" class=\"text\">\n        <input type = \"submit\">\n    </form> \n</html>\n```\n\nAnd the database.html:\n\n```\nTHIS IS THE QUERY:\n\n{{query}}\n```"

        "content": "The \"Method Not Allowed\" error generally indicates that the server received a request using a method it doesn't support for a specific route. In your case, the problem arises because of a mismatch between the form's `action` attribute and the route handling the form submission.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Form Action Mismatch**: Your form in `entry.html` is set to submit to the `/database` URL with a `POST` method. However, your `database()` route is only set up to handle `GET` requests.\n\n2. **Route Handling**: The `entry_page()` route is the one designed to handle the form submissions with `POST` requests, but your form is not pointing to it. Instead, it's pointing to `/database`, which does not accept `POST` requests.\n\n### Solution:\n\n1. **Form Action Correction**: Change the `action` attribute in your form to point to the correct route (`/entry`) that is set up to handle `POST` requests.\n\n2. **Route Method Adjustment**: Make sure the form's action points to the route designed to process the POST request.\n\nHere's the corrected code for your form in `entry.html`:\n\n```html\nTHIS IS THE BLOG ENTRY PAGE\n\nblog:\n<html>\n    <form action='/entry' method=\"post\">\n        <label for=\"date\">Date</label>\n        <input name=\"date\" type=\"text\" class=\"text\">\n        \n        <label for=\"blog_title\">Title</label>\n        <input name=\"blog_title\" type=\"text\" class=\"text\">\n        \n        <label for=\"blog_main\">Main</label>\n        <input name=\"blog_main\" type=\"text\" class=\"text\">\n        \n        <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\">\n    </form> \n</html>\n```\n\n### Additional Suggestions:\n\n- **Form Enhancements**: Adding `<label>` tags for better accessibility and clarity.\n- **Session Query Improvements**: Ensure that the `session.query` is properly importing the session from SQLAlchemy if not already done.\n\nOnce you make these changes, your form should correctly submit the data to the `/entry` route, which will handle it and then redirect to the `/database` page after successful submission. This should resolve the \"Method Not Allowed\" error."
