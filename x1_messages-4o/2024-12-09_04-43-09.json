Here is the code I am using to create the boxplot:\n\n```python\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set_style(\"whitegrid\")\ntips = sns.load_dataset(\"tips\")\nax = sns.boxplot(x=\"day\", y=\"total_bill\", data=tips)\n```"

        "content": "To set the range of the y-axis for a Seaborn boxplot, you can use the `set_ylim()` method from Matplotlib. Here's how you can modify your code to limit the y-axis range to between 10 and 40:\n\n```python\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nsns.set_style(\"whitegrid\")\ntips = sns.load_dataset(\"tips\")\nax = sns.boxplot(x=\"day\", y=\"total_bill\", data=tips)\n\n# Set the range of the y-axis\nax.set_ylim(10, 40)\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis code will create a boxplot and set the y-axis limits to the range you specified. The `set_ylim()` method is called on the Axes object returned by the `sns.boxplot()` function, allowing you to control the y-axis range."
