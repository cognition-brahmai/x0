        "content": "I am having difficulty understanding how \"axis\" is defined in Python, especially in relation to Pandas Dataframes and Numpy Arrays. In the code provided, when I call `df.mean(axis=1)`, I get a mean across the rows. However, when I call `df.drop(name, axis=1)`, a column is dropped instead of a row. Could you help me understand what exactly \"axis\" means in pandas/numpy/scipy? Additionally, the official documentation for `DataFrame.mean` seems to indicate that `axis=1` should result in a mean over the columns, not the rows. Is this a mistake in the documentation or am I misunderstanding something?\n\n```python\ndf = pd.DataFrame([[1, 1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3, 3]], columns=[\"col1\", \"col2\", \"col3\", \"col4\"])\ndf.mean(axis=1)\ndf.drop(\"col4\", axis=1)\n```"

        "content": "Understanding the concept of \"axis\" in Pandas and NumPy can be a bit confusing initially, but once you grasp the notion, it becomes quite intuitive.\n\nIn both Pandas and NumPy, the concept of \"axis\" refers to the dimension along which an operation is performed. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Axis 0**: Refers to the index axis or the \"rows\" of a DataFrame or array. Think of it as moving **down** the rows.\n   - In `df.mean(axis=0)`, it calculates the mean for each column, moving down the rows.\n   - In `df.drop(name, axis=0)`, it would drop a row, because you're dropping along the index axis.\n\n2. **Axis 1**: Refers to the columns. Think of it as moving **across** the columns.\n   - In `df.mean(axis=1)`, it calculates the mean for each row, moving across the columns.\n   - In `df.drop(name, axis=1)`, it drops a column, because you're dropping along the column axis.\n\nThe confusion often arises because people tend to think of \"axis\" as referring to what you want to keep, rather than the direction in which the operation is performed. \n\nIn your example:\n- `df.mean(axis=1)` calculates the mean across the columns for each row, which means the mean is computed row-wise.\n- `df.drop(\"col4\", axis=1)` drops a column, which means you're dropping along the columns.\n\nRegarding the documentation, the explanation of axis might sometimes read as if \"axis=1\" corresponds to columns, which can be mistaken to imply that the operation affects the columns themselves. However, it actually means that the operation is conducted across the columns (for each row).\n\nTo summarize, when you specify `axis=1`, you're telling Pandas/NumPy to perform the operation across columns (i.e., row-wise), and when you specify `axis=0`, the operation is performed across rows (i.e., column-wise). This understanding should clarify the operations and help avoid confusion in the future."
