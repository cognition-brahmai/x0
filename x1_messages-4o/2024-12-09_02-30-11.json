How can I import the package within the module that resides within the package, so I can use that function? I have tried importing `__init__` inside the module but it does not import the package, instead it imports a module named `__init__`, resulting in two copies of things with different names. What is the pythonic way to resolve this?"

        "content": "To resolve this issue, you should import the package itself rather than directly importing the `__init__.py` file. The `__init__.py` file is a special file that helps Python treat a directory as a package, and it can also contain initialization code for the package. If you want to use a function defined in `__init__.py` within another module of the same package, you can simply import the package itself in the module.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n1. **Package Structure**:\n   Suppose you have the following package structure:\n\n   ```\n   mypackage/\n       __init__.py\n       module1.py\n   ```\n\n   And `__init__.py` contains a function `my_function`.\n\n2. **Content of `__init__.py`**:\n   ```python\n   # __init__.py\n   def my_function():\n       print(\"Hello from my_function!\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Content of `module1.py`**:\n   In `module1.py`, you should import the package itself, not the `__init__.py` directly:\n\n   ```python\n   # module1.py\n   from . import mypackage  # Import the package\n\n   def use_function():\n       mypackage.my_function()  # Use the function defined in __init__.py\n   ```\n\nIn this example, by importing `mypackage`, you have access to everything defined in `__init__.py`. The `from . import mypackage` statement imports the package relative to the package directory, allowing you to use `mypackage.my_function()` within `module1.py`.\n\nThis approach avoids importing `__init__.py` directly and ensures that you are working with the package namespace, which is the more Pythonic way to manage package imports."
