To generate the next term in the sequence, you describe the digits of the previous term.\n\nHere's how you generate each term:\n\n1. Start with the term: 1\n2. Describe it: One 1 \u2192 11\n3. Describe 11: Two 1s \u2192 21\n4. Describe 21: One 2, One 1 \u2192 1211\n5. Describe 1211: One 1, One 2, Two 1s \u2192 111221\n6. Describe 111221: Three 1s, Two 2s, One 1 \u2192 312211\n7. Describe 312211: One 3, One 1, Two 2s, Two 1s \u2192 13112221\n\nNow, let's find the next term:\n\n- Describe 13112221: One 1, One 3, Two 1s, Three 2s, One 1 \u2192 1113213211\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is 1113213211."
