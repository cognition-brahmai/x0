        "content": "To write the list of tuples to a text file with two columns and multiple rows, you can use Python's file handling capabilities. Here's a step-by-step guide and the code to achieve that:\n\n1. Open the file in write mode using the `open()` function.\n2. Iterate over each tuple in the list.\n3. Write each tuple to the file, formatting it so that the two elements are separated by a space.\n4. Close the file once all tuples have been written.\n\nHere's the Python code that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\n# Define the list of tuples\ndata = [\n    (8, 'rfa'), (8, 'acc-raid'), (7, 'rapidbase'), \n    (7, 'rcts'), (7, 'tve-announce'), (5, 'mysql-im'), \n    (5, 'telnetcpcd'), (5, 'etftp'), (5, 'http-alt')\n]\n\n# Open a file in write mode\nwith open('output.txt', 'w') as file:\n    # Iterate over each tuple in the list\n    for number, label in data:\n        # Write the tuple to the file, formatted with a space\n        file.write(f\"{number} {label}\\n\")\n\n# The file is automatically closed when using 'with' block\n```\n\nThis code will create a file named `output.txt` in the same directory as your script, and it will contain the desired output format:\n\n```\n8 rfa\n8 acc-raid\n7 rapidbase\n7 rcts\n7 tve-announce\n5 mysql-im\n5 telnetcpcd\n5 etftp\n5 http-alt\n```\n\nMake sure to run this code in an environment where you have write permissions to the directory, and the file will be created with the formatted content."
