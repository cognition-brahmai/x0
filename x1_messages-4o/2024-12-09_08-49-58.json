        "content": "To create a program that calculates the sum of all the elements in a given array, you can use various programming languages. Below is an example in Python, which is simple and widely used:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_sum(arr):\n    total = 0\n    for element in arr:\n        total += element\n    return total\n\n# Example usage\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nsum_of_elements = calculate_sum(array)\nprint(\"The sum of the elements is:\", sum_of_elements)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `calculate_sum` that takes an array as input and iterates over each element, adding it to a `total` variable. Finally, it returns the total sum. You can modify the `array` variable with the array you want to calculate the sum for.\n\nIf you're using another language, the logic remains similar: initialize a sum variable, iterate through the array, and add each element to the sum.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick example in Java:\n\n```java\npublic class SumArray {\n    public static int calculateSum(int[] arr) {\n        int total = 0;\n        for (int element : arr) {\n            total += element;\n        }\n        return total;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n        int sumOfElements = calculateSum(array);\n        System.out.println(\"The sum of the elements is: \" + sumOfElements);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn Java, the method `calculateSum` does the same thing by iterating over the array with a for-each loop. The `main` method demonstrates how to use this function. You can adapt this logic to other languages as needed."
