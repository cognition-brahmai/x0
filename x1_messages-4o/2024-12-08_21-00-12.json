        "content": "To count the number of countries that have coastlines along the Mediterranean Sea, you can utilize a SQL `SELECT` query with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows where the `sea_name` is \"Mediterranean Sea\". You can then use the `COUNT` function to count the distinct countries. Here's how you could write the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT name) AS number_of_countries\nFROM countries\nWHERE sea_name = 'Mediterranean Sea';\n```\n\nThis query selects the count of distinct country names from the `countries` table where the `sea_name` is \"Mediterranean Sea\". The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that each country is only counted once, even if there are multiple entries for the same country."
