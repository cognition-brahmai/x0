Here's a simple implementation of such a function:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdbool.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\n#define CHAR_COUNT 256\n\nbool areAnagrams(char *str1, char *str2) {\n    // If lengths of both strings are not same, they cannot be anagrams\n    if (strlen(str1) != strlen(str2)) {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Create a count array and initialize all values as 0\n    int count[CHAR_COUNT] = {0};\n\n    // For each character in input strings, increment count in the count array\n    for (int i = 0; str1[i] && str2[i]; i++) {\n        count[(unsigned char)str1[i]]++;\n        count[(unsigned char)str2[i]]--;\n    }\n\n    // Check if there is any non-zero value in count array\n    for (int i = 0; i < CHAR_COUNT; i++) {\n        if (count[i] != 0) {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return true;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    char str1[] = \"listen\";\n    char str2[] = \"silent\";\n\n    if (areAnagrams(str1, str2)) {\n        printf(\"The strings are anagrams.\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"The strings are not anagrams.\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Character Count Array:** We use an array of size 256 to account for all possible ASCII characters. This array keeps track of the number of times each character appears in both strings.\n- **Iterate and Compare:** For each character in both strings, we increment the count for characters in the first string and decrement for characters in the second string.\n- **Check for Balance:** If the two strings are anagrams, the count array should be all zeros at the end, indicating that every character's count was balanced between the two strings.\n\nThis function will correctly determine if the two strings are anagrams of each other."
