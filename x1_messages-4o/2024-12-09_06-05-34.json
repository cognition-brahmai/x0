I tried to clear all the variables I used by running `session.clear()`, but it returned an error stating that no such command exists. Can anyone guide me on how to clear the `SecureCookieSession` and how to clear the session every time I shutdown the server or close the website?"

        "content": "To clear a Flask session, you can use the `session.clear()` method, which is the correct approach to remove all the data stored in the session. If you're encountering errors using `session.clear()`, it might be due to issues elsewhere in your code or environment setup. Here are some steps and considerations to help you resolve this:\n\n1. **Ensure Proper Importation**: Make sure you have imported `session` from `flask` at the top of your script.\n   ```python\n   from flask import Flask, session\n   ```\n\n2. **Clearing the Session**: To clear the session, you can use the following code snippet in your route or function:\n   ```python\n   @app.route('/logout')\n   def logout():\n       session.clear()\n       return \"Session cleared!\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Session Configuration**: Ensure that your Flask app is properly configured to use sessions. You need to set a secret key for your Flask app to use sessions securely:\n   ```python\n   app = Flask(__name__)\n   app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your_secret_key'\n   ```\n\n4. **Clearing Session on Shutdown**: Flask does not automatically clear sessions when the server shuts down. However, since Flask's default session is stored in cookies (using `SecureCookieSession`), it will naturally expire when the user closes their browser, unless you've set a specific `PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME`.\n\n5. **Manual Session Expiry**: If you want to ensure session data is cleared when the server restarts, you can set sessions to be non-permanent and set a specific timeout:\n   ```python\n   from datetime import timedelta\n\n   app.config['PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME'] = timedelta(minutes=30)\n   session.permanent = False\n   ```\n\n6. **Debugging the Error**: If you're still getting an error, double-check the error message for more clues and ensure you are not accidentally overwriting the `session` object with some other variable in your code.\n\nIf you follow these steps and the problem persists, consider sharing the exact error message you receive, which might help in diagnosing the issue further."
