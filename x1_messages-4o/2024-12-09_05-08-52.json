For example, if I have a list [1, 2, 3], I would like to get the following pairs: 1 - 2, 2 - 3, 3 - 1."

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this in a Pythonic way using list comprehension and the `zip` function. Here's how you can iterate over a list in a circular pairwise manner:\n\n```python\ndef circular_pairwise(lst):\n    return list(zip(lst, lst[1:] + lst[:1]))\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3]\npairs = circular_pairwise(my_list)\nprint(pairs)  # Output: [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1)]\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `lst[1:] + lst[:1]` creates a new list where the elements are shifted left by one position, and the first element is appended to the end. For the list `[1, 2, 3]`, this results in `[2, 3, 1]`.\n- `zip(lst, lst[1:] + lst[:1])` pairs each element of the original list with the corresponding element of the shifted list, effectively creating the circular pairs you want.\n- `list(zip(...))` converts the `zip` object into a list of tuples.\n\nThis method is both concise and efficient for creating circular pairs from a list."
