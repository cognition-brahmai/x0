I've noticed this due to the following error: \"Your CPU supports instructions that this TensorFlow binary was not compiled to use: AVX2\". I've installed both tensorflow and tensorflow-gpu. How can I switch to using the GPU version?"

        "content": "To utilize the GPU version of TensorFlow instead of the CPU version, follow these steps to ensure your environment is correctly set up for GPU computation:\n\n1. **Check GPU Compatibility**: Make sure your GPU is compatible with TensorFlow. TensorFlow requires a CUDA-enabled GPU with compute capability 3.5 or higher.\n\n2. **Install NVIDIA Drivers**: Ensure you have the latest NVIDIA drivers installed for your GPU. You can download them from the [NVIDIA website](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx).\n\n3. **Install CUDA Toolkit**: Download and install the CUDA Toolkit from the [NVIDIA website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit). Ensure that the version you install is compatible with your TensorFlow version. You can check the compatibility matrix on the [TensorFlow website](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu).\n\n4. **Install cuDNN**: Download and install cuDNN from the [NVIDIA Developer website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn). You need to register and log in to access the download. Again, make sure the version of cuDNN is compatible with your installed CUDA Toolkit and TensorFlow version.\n\n5. **Configure Environment Variables**: After installing CUDA and cuDNN, add their respective `bin` directories to your system's `PATH` environment variable, and make sure the `CUDA_HOME` environment variable points to your CUDA installation.\n\n6. **Verify TensorFlow GPU Installation**: You can verify if TensorFlow is using the GPU by running the following command in Python:\n\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n   print(\"Num GPUs Available: \", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))\n   ```\n\n   This should output the number of GPUs available. If it's greater than 0, TensorFlow is using the GPU.\n\n7. **Ensure TensorFlow-GPU is Installed**: You should install `tensorflow-gpu` which includes GPU support. You can do this via pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install tensorflow==<compatible_version>\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<compatible_version>` with an appropriate version that supports GPU. Note that as of TensorFlow 2.x, the `tensorflow` package includes both CPU and GPU support, so you might not need to specifically install `tensorflow-gpu`.\n\n8. **Check for GPU Utilization**: When running your TensorFlow code, you can monitor GPU utilization by using tools like `nvidia-smi` in the command line. This tool provides details about GPU usage.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to switch from CPU to GPU computation with TensorFlow in Python. If you encounter any issues, ensure that all versions of CUDA, cuDNN, and TensorFlow are compatible with each other."
