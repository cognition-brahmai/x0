But, I'm facing a problem where I have too many submodules in 'helpers/' and it's hard to decide which method should be put into which file. Is there a better way to organize this?"

        "content": "Managing a growing codebase in a project like yours is a common challenge, and organizing it effectively can significantly improve productivity and maintainability. Here are some strategies you can consider to better organize your code:\n\n1. **Modularization**: Instead of having a single directory with many submodules, consider grouping related functionalities into packages. For example:\n   - `helpers/plot/` for all plotting-related methods\n   - `helpers/data/` for data manipulation and processing\n   - `helpers/model/` for model fitting and analysis\n\n   Each package can have an `__init__.py` file to allow for easier imports and to define what functions/classes are accessible when the package is imported.\n\n2. **Functional Grouping**: Re-evaluate the grouping of your functions and consider the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). Each module should have a clear and focused responsibility. If a function doesn't fit the purpose of the current module, consider creating a new module.\n\n3. **Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive and consistent naming conventions for your modules and functions. This will make it easier to locate and understand their purpose.\n\n4. **Documentation**: Include documentation within your modules and functions to provide context and usage examples. This will help you and others understand the purpose of each module without having to dig too deeply into the code.\n\n5. **Index or Registry Pattern**: Create an index or registry module that provides a centralized location for importing commonly used functions or classes. This can help reduce clutter in your notebooks and make it easier to manage imports.\n\n6. **Refactor and Simplify**: Periodically refactor your code to eliminate redundancy and improve clarity. As your project evolves, some methods may become obsolete or could be simplified.\n\n7. **Version Control**: Use a version control system like Git to track changes and manage different versions of your code. This allows you to experiment with new structures without losing previous work.\n\n8. **Testing**: Implement unit tests for your modules to ensure that changes don't introduce bugs. This will also give you confidence to refactor and reorganize your code.\n\n9. **Consider Using Classes**: If you find that certain functions are always used together, consider encapsulating them within a class. This can help organize related functions and data together.\n\nBy applying these strategies, you should be able to create a more organized and maintainable codebase that supports your research workflow effectively."
