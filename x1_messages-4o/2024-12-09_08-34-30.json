The code I'm using is:\n```python\nimport random\n\nclass Sample(object):\n    '''This class defines various methods related to the sample'''\n\n    def drawSample(samplesize,List):\n        sample=random.sample(List,samplesize)\n        return sample\n\nChoices=range(100)\nprint Sample.drawSample(5,Choices)\n```\nI have found that by using `@staticmethod` above the method definition, I can get the code to run. Could you please explain why one would want to define static methods? Why can't all methods be defined as static methods?"

        "content": "In Python, a static method is a method that belongs to a class rather than an instance of the class. You can call it without creating an instance of the class. Static methods do not have access to the instance (`self`) or class (`cls`) variables unless they are explicitly passed in as arguments. They are defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator.\n\nHere's why you might want to define static methods:\n\n1. **Utility Functions**: When you have a method that doesn't need to access any instance or class-specific data, it can be defined as a static method. These methods often perform some utility functions related to the class, but they don't require any data from the class itself.\n\n2. **Code Organization**: Static methods can help you organize your code better. If a function is logically related to a class but doesn't necessarily need to operate on an instance of that class, it can be a static method.\n\n3. **Namespace Management**: By keeping related functions within a class, you can manage the code namespace more effectively. This can make your code easier to read and understand.\n\nHowever, not all methods can or should be static:\n\n1. **Instance Methods**: Most methods need to operate on data that is specific to an instance of a class. These methods require access to the instance's attributes and are defined with a `self` parameter.\n\n2. **Class Methods**: Some methods need to operate on class-level data or require the class itself as a context. These methods are defined using the `@classmethod` decorator and take a `cls` parameter.\n\n3. **Encapsulation**: Static methods do not provide encapsulation. If your method needs to interact with the internal state of the class, it's better to use instance or class methods.\n\nIn your example, the `drawSample` function does not require access to any instance-specific data, so it's a suitable candidate for a static method. That is why adding the `@staticmethod` decorator solves the issue.\n\nHere's your code with the `@staticmethod` decorator:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nclass Sample(object):\n    '''This class defines various methods related to the sample'''\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def drawSample(samplesize, List):\n        sample = random.sample(List, samplesize)\n        return sample\n\nChoices = range(100)\nprint(Sample.drawSample(5, Choices))\n```\n\nWith the `@staticmethod` decorator, you can call `Sample.drawSample(5, Choices)` without creating an instance of `Sample`."
