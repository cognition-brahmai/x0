When I checked for psycopg2 package, it's already installed and the package `python-psycopg2-2.4.5-1.rhel5.x86_64` is at its latest version. What could be causing this issue?"

        "content": "The `ImportError: No module named psycopg2` error, despite having `python-psycopg2` installed, could be caused by a few different issues. Here are some potential solutions you can try to resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Python Path Issue**: Ensure that the Python interpreter used by OpenERP is the same one where `psycopg2` is installed. You can check which Python version is being used by OpenERP and ensure it matches with the one where `psycopg2` is installed. You can do this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   which python\n   ```\n\n   Then, check where `psycopg2` is installed:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -c \"import psycopg2; print(psycopg2.__file__)\"\n   ```\n\n   Make sure both commands point to the same Python installation.\n\n2. **Virtual Environment**: If you are using a virtual environment, make sure it is activated before running the OpenERP server command. Activate your virtual environment with:\n\n   ```bash\n   source /path/to/virtualenv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n   Then, try running the OpenERP command again.\n\n3. **Check PYTHONPATH**: Verify if `PYTHONPATH` is set correctly. It should include the directory where `psycopg2` is installed. You can check this by:\n\n   ```bash\n   echo $PYTHONPATH\n   ```\n\n   If `psycopg2` is not in the path, you can add it temporarily by:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/psycopg2\n   ```\n\n4. **Reinstall psycopg2**: Sometimes, reinstalling the package can resolve issues:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo yum remove python-psycopg2\n   sudo yum install python-psycopg2\n   ```\n\n   Alternatively, you can use `pip` if you have it installed:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall psycopg2\n   ```\n\n5. **Check for Multiple Python Versions**: If there are multiple Python installations on your system, ensure that you are using the correct version with the necessary packages installed. You may need to specify the full path to the Python binary when running the OpenERP server.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the ImportError related to `psycopg2`. If the issue persists, consider checking the OpenERP logs for additional error messages or context that might help diagnose the problem."
