The error I receive is \"Attempting to deserialize object on a CUDA device but torch.cuda.is_available() is False.

        "content": "The error you're encountering seems to be related to loading a PyTorch model that was saved with CUDA tensors on a machine that doesn't have a GPU available. When running your code on a CPU-only machine, you need to map the model's tensors to the CPU during the loading process. Here's how you can modify your code to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Modify the `torch.load` call:** When loading the model, use the `map_location` parameter to map the tensors to the CPU. Locate the part of your code where the model is being loaded and modify it as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    import torch\n\n    # Assuming you have a path to the saved model\n    model_path = 'path/to/your/model.pth'\n\n    # Load the model on the CPU\n    model = torch.load(model_path, map_location='cpu')\n    ```\n\n2. **Check for other CUDA-specific code:** Ensure that there are no other parts in the codebase where CUDA-specific operations are being performed. If CUDA operations are explicitly specified, you may need to adjust these sections to work on the CPU, using `.to('cpu')` or similar methods.\n\n3. **Set the device properly:** Ensure that the device is set to `'cpu'` throughout your code. For instance, if you're moving tensors or models to a device, ensure it's set to CPU:\n\n    ```python\n    device = torch.device('cpu')\n    ```\n\n    And when moving tensors or models:\n\n    ```python\n    tensor = tensor.to(device)\n    model = model.to(device)\n    ```\n\n4. **Review the GitHub repository for documentation or issues:** Sometimes, the repository maintainers provide specific instructions for running the code on a CPU. Check the repository\u2019s README file or the issues section for any related discussions or solutions.\n\n5. **Contact the maintainers or the community:** If the problem persists, consider opening an issue on the GitHub repository or reaching out to the maintainers for guidance. They might have encountered similar issues and could provide additional insights.\n\nBy ensuring that all CUDA-specific operations are adapted for CPU execution and that the model is loaded correctly on the CPU, you should be able to resolve the `RuntimeError` you're encountering."
