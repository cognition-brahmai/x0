        "content": "### Characteristics of a Hydrogen Atom\n\n**English:**\n- Simplest and most abundant element in the universe.\n- Atomic number 1.\n- Consists of one proton and one electron.\n\n**Spanish:**\n- El elemento m\u00e1s simple y abundante en el universo.\n- N\u00famero at\u00f3mico 1.\n- Consta de un prot\u00f3n y un electr\u00f3n.\n\n**Mandarin (Simplified Chinese):**\n- \u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u6700\u7b80\u5355\u548c\u6700\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u3002\n- \u539f\u5b50\u5e8f\u65701\u3002\n- \u7531\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d28\u5b50\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7535\u5b50\u7ec4\u6210\u3002\n\n### Electron Configuration of Hydrogen\n\nUsing the Aufbau principle, the electron configuration of a hydrogen atom is:\n\n- 1s\u00b9\n\n### Table: Ionization Energy and Electron Affinity\n\n| Isotope    | Ionization Energy (eV) | Electron Affinity (eV) |\n|------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Hydrogen   | 13.6                   | 0.754                  |\n| Deuterium  | Slightly higher than H | Similar to H           |\n| Tritium    | Slightly higher than D | Similar to D           |\n\n*Note: The ionization energy of deuterium and tritium is slightly higher than that of hydrogen due to the increased mass, which affects the quantum mechanical properties, but the difference is very small.*\n\n### Spectral Lines of Hydrogen Atom\n\nThe spectral lines of the hydrogen atom are part of different series, each corresponding to transitions of electrons between energy levels.\n\n#### Lyman Series\n- **Transitions**: Electrons falling from higher energy levels (n \u2265 2) to the first energy level (n = 1).\n- **Wavelength Range**: Ultraviolet.\n- **Energy Levels**: Highest energy transitions because they end at the first energy level.\n\n#### Balmer Series\n- **Transitions**: Electrons falling from higher energy levels (n \u2265 3) to the second energy level (n = 2).\n- **Wavelength Range**: Visible.\n- **Energy Levels**: Intermediate energy transitions, visible as colors.\n\n#### Paschen Series\n- **Transitions**: Electrons falling from higher energy levels (n \u2265 4) to the third energy level (n = 3).\n- **Wavelength Range**: Infrared.\n- **Energy Levels**: Lower energy transitions compared to Lyman and Balmer.\n\n### Relation to Energy Levels\n\n- **Energy Level Transitions**: The energy of the photon emitted during a transition is directly related to the difference in energy between the two levels. The larger the difference, the higher the energy and shorter the wavelength of the emitted photon.\n- **Lyman Series**: Involves the largest energy jumps, hence the highest energy photons in the ultraviolet range.\n- **Balmer Series**: Involves smaller energy jumps than Lyman, producing visible light photons.\n- **Paschen Series**: Involves even smaller energy jumps, resulting in infrared photons.\n\nThese spectral lines are critical in understanding atomic structure and have been fundamental in the development of quantum mechanics."
