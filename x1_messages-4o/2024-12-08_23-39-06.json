        "content": "To find all possible subsets whose sum equals the target number (14) and ensure the subsets are sorted in non-descending order based on their length, we can use a backtracking approach. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1. **Sort the Array**: Start by sorting the array to ensure we consider subsets in a sorted order. This will help in generating subsets that are inherently sorted.\n\n2. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all combinations of the array elements. This involves:\n   - Adding an element to the current subset.\n   - Checking if the current subset's sum equals the target. If it does, add it to the result list.\n   - If the sum exceeds the target, backtrack.\n   - Move to the next element and repeat.\n\n3. **Avoid Duplicates**: If the array contains duplicates, ensure that only unique subsets are considered.\n\n4. **Sorting the Result**: Once all valid subsets are found, sort them based on their length in non-descending order.\n\nHere's a Python function implementing this approach:\n\n```python\ndef find_subsets(nums, target):\n    def backtrack(start, path, target):\n        if target == 0:\n            result.append(list(path))\n            return\n        for i in range(start, len(nums)):\n            if nums[i] > target:\n                break\n            path.append(nums[i])\n            backtrack(i + 1, path, target - nums[i])\n            path.pop()\n    \n    nums.sort()\n    result = []\n    backtrack(0, [], target)\n    \n    # Sort the result based on the length of subsets\n    result.sort(key=len)\n    return result\n\n# Input array and target\narray = [3, 17, 6, 2, 8, 9]\ntarget_sum = 14\n\n# Find and print all subsets\nsubsets = find_subsets(array, target_sum)\nfor subset in subsets:\n    print(subset)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Sorting**: Initially, the array is sorted to `[2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 17]`.\n- **Backtracking**: Explore each element, recursively adding it to the current path, and checking if the path's sum equals the target.\n- **Result Compilation**: The valid subsets are stored and sorted based on their length.\n\n### Output:\nThe valid subsets for the given array and target sum are:\n- `[2, 3, 9]`\n- `[6, 8]`\n\nThese subsets are sorted by their length in non-descending order."
