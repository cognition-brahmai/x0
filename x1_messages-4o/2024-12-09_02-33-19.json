Can you help me solve this issue?"

        "content": "The error message indicates that the `xlrd` package required to read Excel files is not installed or not recognized by your environment. Here are some steps you can follow to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify Python Version:**\n   Make sure you're using a compatible version of Python. If you're using Python 3, ensure your virtual environment is activated for Python 3.\n\n2. **Install `xlrd`:**\n   Ensure you have the `xlrd` package installed. You can install it using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install xlrd\n   ```\n\n   If you're using Python 3, use `pip3`:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip3 install xlrd\n   ```\n\n3. **Check the Environment:**\n   Ensure that you are installing `xlrd` in the same environment where your script is running. If you're using a virtual environment, activate it before installing:\n\n   ```bash\n   source /path/to/your/venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate\n   pip install xlrd\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify Installation:**\n   After installation, check if `xlrd` is installed correctly by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip show xlrd\n   ```\n\n   This should display the details of the `xlrd` package if it's installed correctly.\n\n5. **Use `openpyxl` for `.xlsx` Files:**\n   Since you're dealing with `.xlsx` files, consider using the `openpyxl` engine, as `xlrd` has dropped support for `.xlsx` files from version 2.0.0 onwards:\n\n   ```python\n   data = pd.read_excel(\"DataAnalysis1/temp1.xlsx\", engine='openpyxl', low_memory=False).fillna(value=0)\n   ```\n\n   Install `openpyxl` if you haven't already:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install openpyxl\n   ```\n\n6. **Check File Path:**\n   Ensure the path to your Excel file is correct. You can use absolute paths to avoid issues with relative paths.\n\nIf you've followed these steps and the error persists, try restarting your Python environment to ensure all changes are recognized."
