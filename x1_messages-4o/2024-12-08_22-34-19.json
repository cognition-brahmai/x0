        "content": "Arranging a list of 10 unique numbers in ascending order using only two comparisons at a time is essentially the task of sorting. Sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, or Selection Sort inherently use pairwise comparisons to sort elements. Given the constraints, let's consider a simplified approach similar to these algorithms:\n\n1. **Start with the first element and compare it with the second.** Swap them if they are in the wrong order.\n2. **Move to the next pair** (second and third elements), and repeat the comparison and swap if needed.\n3. **Continue this process** through the list until the largest element \"bubbles up\" to the last position.\n4. **Repeat the process** for the remaining list (excluding the last sorted element) until all elements are sorted.\n\nThis is essentially a variant of the Bubble Sort algorithm, which is simple but effective for small lists. Although it uses O(n^2) comparisons in the worst case, it's feasible for a list of 10 numbers.\n\nUltimately, you will have compared and sorted the numbers in ascending order using repeated pairwise comparisons."
