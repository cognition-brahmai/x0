        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to circular imports between your `a.py` and `b.py` files. When `a.py` tries to import `B` from `b.py` and `b.py` tries to import `A` from `a.py`, it creates a circular dependency. Here's a way to resolve this issue:\n\n### Solution\n\nTo handle circular dependencies, we need to break the circular import chain. We'll do this by using local imports within the methods where the dependency is needed instead of at the top of the file.\n\n1. **Modify `lib/a.py`:**\n\n   Move the import statement inside the method where `B` is used. This delays the import until the method is called, which helps avoid circular dependency issues.\n\n   ```python\n   class A:\n       def __init__(self):\n           print(\"A\")\n\n       def hello(self):\n           print(\"hello A\")\n           from lib.b import B  # Local import to avoid circular dependency\n           b = B()\n           b.hello()\n   ```\n\n2. **Modify `lib/b.py`:**\n\n   Similarly, move the import statement inside the method where `A` is used.\n\n   ```python\n   class B:\n       def __init__(self):\n           print(\"B\")\n\n       def hello(self):\n           print(\"hello B\")\n           from lib.a import A  # Local import to avoid circular dependency\n           a = A()\n           a.hello()\n   ```\n\n3. **Update `lib/__init__.py`:**\n\n   Ensure the imports in `__init__.py` are absolute and point to the correct modules.\n\n   ```python\n   from .a import A\n   from .b import B\n   ```\n\n4. **Check your `main.py`:**\n\n   Make sure the imports in `main.py` are correct and the script is executing as expected.\n\n   ```python\n   from lib import A, B\n\n   def main():\n       a = A()\n       b = B()\n       a.hello()\n       b.hello()\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       main()\n   ```\n\n### Explanation\n\nBy moving the imports inside the method bodies, you prevent the circular dependency from causing an import error. The modules will not attempt to import each other at the top level, thus breaking the circular loop. This is a common pattern to resolve circular import issues in Python."
