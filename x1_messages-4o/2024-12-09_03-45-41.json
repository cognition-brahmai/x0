I am trying to check if these lists are circularly identical, meaning they are the same if you consider the start and the end to be connected. Currently, I am using a function that requires 55 cyclic shift operations at worst and there are 26,235 lists to be compared with each other. This results in nearly 20 Giga computations. Is there a more efficient way to check circular identity in Python or any data types that support this concept? Here are some example lists and the function I'm currently using:\n\n```python\na[0] = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\na[1] = [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\na[2] = [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\ndef is_dup(a, b):\n    for i in range(len(a)):\n        if a == list(numpy.roll(b, i)): # shift b circularly by i\n            return True\n    return False\n```"

        "content": "To efficiently check if the lists are circularly identical without performing numerous cyclic shift operations, you can take advantage of the fact that each list is composed mostly of zeros and only three ones. A more efficient approach involves using string concatenation and substring search, which can significantly reduce the number of computations. Here's how you can do that:\n\n1. Convert each list into a string.\n2. Concatenate the string with itself.\n3. Check if the other list, converted to a string, is a substring of the concatenated string.\n\nThis method leverages the idea that if two lists are circularly identical, one list should appear as a substring in the concatenated version of the other list.\n\nHere's an implementation of this approach:\n\n```python\ndef circularly_identical(list1, list2):\n    # Convert lists to strings\n    str1 = ''.join(map(str, list1))\n    str2 = ''.join(map(str, list2))\n    \n    # Concatenate str1 with itself\n    doubled_str1 = str1 + str1\n    \n    # Check if str2 is a substring of doubled_str1\n    return str2 in doubled_str1\n\n# Example usage\na = [\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n    [1, 1, 0, 0, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n]\n\n# Compare each list with every other list\nfor i in range(len(a)):\n    for j in range(i + 1, len(a)):\n        if circularly_identical(a[i], a[j]):\n            print(f\"List {i} and List {j} are circularly identical.\")\n```\n\nThis approach reduces the complexity significantly by using string operations, which are generally faster and more optimized than manual cyclic shifts. Note that this code assumes the lists have the same number of elements and the same number of ones, as in your use case."
