However, whenever `x` is too large (for example, `x = 1000`), the result is `inf`, even though I've tried it with the math/numpy library and float64 as the data type. How can I handle this function with large numbers to avoid an overflow?"

        "content": "When implementing the softplus function, `log(1 + exp(x))`, handling large values of `x` can indeed lead to overflow issues due to the `exp(x)` term. To address this, you can use a numerically stable version of the softplus function. The idea is to approximate the function differently for large values of `x` to avoid overflow. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef stable_softplus(x):\n    # For large x, use the approximation: softplus(x) \u2248 x\n    # For small x, use the original formula: log(1 + exp(x))\n    return np.where(x > 20, x, np.log1p(np.exp(x)))\n\n# Example usage:\nx_large = 1000\nx_small = -1000\nx_array = np.array([x_large, x_small, 0, 1, 2, 3])\n\nsoftplus_values = stable_softplus(x_array)\nprint(softplus_values)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`np.where`**: This function is used to apply the condition. It checks where `x > 20` and uses `x` directly for those cases to avoid the overflow, as `softplus(x) \u2248 x` when `x` is large.\n- **`np.log1p`**: This function computes `log(1 + exp(x))` in a numerically stable way for smaller values of `x`, avoiding potential precision issues when `x` is close to zero.\n\nBy using these techniques, you can compute the softplus function reliably even for very large values of `x`. Adjust the threshold (`20` in this case) as necessary based on your specific needs and precision requirements."
