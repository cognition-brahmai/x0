I installed 'pymysql' using both 'pip' and 'pip3', however, every time I try to use 'import pymysql', it returns an ImportError stating 'No module named 'pymysql''. The same Python file works on Windows with Python 3.5, but not on Ubuntu. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "It sounds like you've run into a common issue where Python can't find the installed PyMySQL module. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this problem:\n\n1. **Verify Installation**: Make sure PyMySQL is installed for the specific version of Python you're using. Run the following commands to check:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.5 -m pip show pymysql\n   ```\n\n   If you don't see any output, PyMySQL might not be installed for Python 3.5.\n\n2. **Install PyMySQL for Python 3.5**: If it's not installed, you can explicitly install PyMySQL for Python 3.5 using:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.5 -m pip install pymysql\n   ```\n\n3. **Check Python Path**: Ensure that the path to the PyMySQL module is included in your Python path. You can check this by running:\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   print(sys.path)\n   ```\n\n   If the path to the site-packages directory where PyMySQL is installed is not listed, you may need to adjust your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.\n\n4. **Virtual Environment**: If you're working within a virtual environment, make sure you're in the correct environment where PyMySQL is installed. Activate the virtual environment using:\n\n   ```bash\n   source /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n   Then try importing PyMySQL again.\n\n5. **Python Version**: Confirm that you're running the script with Python 3.5. Use the following command to explicitly specify the Python version when running your script:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.5 your_script.py\n   ```\n\n6. **Reinstall PyMySQL**: Sometimes, reinstalling the module can resolve any issues with corrupted installations:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.5 -m pip uninstall pymysql\n   python3.5 -m pip install pymysql\n   ```\n\n7. **Check for Typos**: Double-check your import statement to ensure there are no typos:\n\n   ```python\n   import pymysql\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully import PyMySQL on your Ubuntu system."
