Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom numpy import matrix, vstack\n\nA = matrix('1.0 2.0; 3.0 4.0')\nB = matrix('5.0 6.0')\n\nC = vstack((A, B))\nprint(\"C=\", C)\n```\n\nThis will produce the combined matrix C as:\n\n```\nC= [[ 1.  2.]\n    [ 3.  4.]\n    [ 5.  6.]]\n```\n\nThe `vstack` function stacks arrays in sequence vertically (row wise), which is similar to the behavior of `C=[A;B]` in MATLAB."
