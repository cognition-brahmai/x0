For instance, when I use the following code:\n\n```python\nimage = Image.open(data)\nimage.thumbnail((36,36), Image.NEAREST)\n```\n\nThe aspect ratio is maintained. However, I need to display the image in a square format, similar to this:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"/media/image.png\" style=\"height:36px; width:36px\" />\n```\n\nIs there a way I can achieve a letterbox style with either a transparent or white background around the image?"

        "content": "To create a square thumbnail of an image while maintaining the aspect ratio and adding a letterbox (padding) style with either a transparent or white background, you can use the Python Imaging Library (PIL). Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\n\ndef create_square_thumbnail(image_path, output_path, size=(36, 36), background_color=(255, 255, 255, 0)):\n    # Open the original image\n    image = Image.open(image_path)\n    \n    # Calculate the aspect ratio and determine the new dimensions\n    original_width, original_height = image.size\n    aspect_ratio = min(size[0] / original_width, size[1] / original_height)\n    new_width = int(original_width * aspect_ratio)\n    new_height = int(original_height * aspect_ratio)\n    \n    # Resize the image while maintaining the aspect ratio\n    image = image.resize((new_width, new_height), Image.ANTIALIAS)\n    \n    # Create a new image with the desired square size and background color\n    square_image = Image.new(\"RGBA\", size, background_color)\n    \n    # Calculate the position to paste the resized image onto the square image\n    paste_position = ((size[0] - new_width) // 2, (size[1] - new_height) // 2)\n    \n    # Paste the resized image onto the square image\n    square_image.paste(image, paste_position)\n    \n    # Save the resulting image\n    square_image.save(output_path)\n\n# Usage\ncreate_square_thumbnail('path_to_input_image.png', 'path_to_output_thumbnail.png')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Open the Original Image**: Use `Image.open()` to load the image you want to process.\n\n2. **Calculate Aspect Ratio**: Calculate the new dimensions of the image while maintaining the aspect ratio. Use `min()` to ensure the image fits within the desired size.\n\n3. **Resize Image**: Use `image.resize()` with `Image.ANTIALIAS` to smoothly resize the image to the calculated dimensions.\n\n4. **Create a Square Image**: Use `Image.new()` to create a new square image with the desired background color. You can choose `(255, 255, 255, 0)` for a transparent background or `(255, 255, 255)` for a white background.\n\n5. **Paste the Resized Image**: Calculate the position to center the resized image within the square image and paste it.\n\n6. **Save the Result**: Save the final image using `square_image.save()`.\n\nThis method will give you a square thumbnail with the original image centered and a border (letterbox) around it. You can adjust the `background_color` to change the padding color as needed."
