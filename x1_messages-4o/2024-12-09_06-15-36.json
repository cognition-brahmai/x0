I am running the following code on Python 2.6 shell:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nprint sys.getdefaultencoding()\n# output is ascii\nprint u'\\xe9'\n# output is \u00e9\n```\nI was expecting either some garbled text or an error after the print statement because \"\u00e9\" is not a part of ASCII and I have not specified any encoding. Can anyone clarify what it means for ASCII to be the default encoding?"

        "content": "In Python 2.6, the default encoding being ASCII means that when Python encounters strings that are not explicitly defined as Unicode, it will assume they are ASCII. This can lead to errors when dealing with non-ASCII characters if you don't handle them correctly.\n\nHowever, in your code, you're using the Unicode string literal `u'\\xe9'`, which is explicitly defining the character as a Unicode string. The `u` prefix before the string denotes that it is a Unicode string, so Python knows to treat it as such. The `\\xe9` is a Unicode escape sequence that represents the character \"\u00e9\".\n\nWhen you print a Unicode string in Python 2.6, the interpreter converts it to a byte string using the system's default encoding, which is usually UTF-8, not ASCII. This is why you're able to see the character \"\u00e9\" printed correctly even though the default encoding is ASCII.\n\nIn summary, the default encoding being ASCII affects how byte strings (non-Unicode strings) are handled. Since you're using a Unicode string with the `u` prefix, Python bypasses the ASCII default for that particular string, allowing it to be displayed correctly."
