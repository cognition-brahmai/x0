However, even though the script runs without any errors, I can't see the DAGs in the Web-UI under Menu -> DAGs. The job appears under Menu -> Browse -> Jobs, but there's nothing in $AIRFLOW_HOME/dags. Is this the expected behavior and if not, can someone explain why this is happening and how can I make the DAG visible in the Web-UI?\n\n```python\nfrom airflow import DAG\nfrom airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nfrom models.correctness_prediction import CorrectnessPrediction\n\ndefault_args = {\n    'owner': 'abc',\n    'depends_on_past': False,\n    'start_date': datetime.now(),\n    'email': ['abc@xyz.com'],\n    'email_on_failure': False,\n    'email_on_retry': False,\n    'retries': 1,\n    'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5)\n}\n\ndef correctness_prediction(arg):\n    CorrectnessPrediction.train()\n\ndag = DAG('daily_processing', default_args=default_args)\n\ntask_1 = PythonOperator(\n    task_id='print_the_context',\n    provide_context=True,\n    python_callable=correctness_prediction,\n    dag=dag)\n```"

        "content": "There are several reasons why your DAG might not be appearing in the Airflow Web UI. Let's go through some troubleshooting steps:\n\n1. **DAG Directory Configuration**:\n   Ensure that your DAG file is placed in the directory specified by `dags_folder` in your `airflow.cfg`. By default, this should be `$AIRFLOW_HOME/dags`. You can check this configuration by looking at the `airflow.cfg` file or by running `airflow info` to see the current configurations.\n\n2. **File Naming**:\n   Make sure that your Python script file name does not start with an underscore (\"_\"). Airflow ignores files that start with an underscore or end with `.pyc`.\n\n3. **Correct DAG Initialization**:\n   Ensure that your DAG is properly initialized. You have initialized it correctly in your script, but always double-check that there are no typos in your DAG definition, especially the `dag` parameter in your task, which you've done correctly.\n\n4. **Start Date**:\n   The `start_date` is set to `datetime.now()`, which can be problematic because it may cause your DAG to not appear if the scheduler thinks it isn't due to run yet. It's usually better to set a fixed past start date, like `datetime(2023, 10, 1)`.\n\n5. **Airflow Scheduler**:\n   Make sure the Airflow scheduler is running. The scheduler is responsible for parsing your DAGs and scheduling tasks. You can start it using:\n   ```bash\n   airflow scheduler\n   ```\n\n6. **Webserver Running**:\n   Ensure that the Airflow webserver is running. Use:\n   ```bash\n   airflow webserver\n   ```\n\n7. **Code Import Errors**:\n   Sometimes, if there is an error in importing modules (like `models.correctness_prediction`), the DAG won't appear. Verify that the module and function `CorrectnessPrediction.train()` exist and are importable.\n\n8. **Airflow Logs**:\n   Check the Airflow logs for any errors that might give you a clue. Logs are usually located in `$AIRFLOW_HOME/logs`.\n\n9. **Refresh the Web UI**:\n   Occasionally, the web UI needs to be refreshed. Try clearing your browser cache or simply refreshing the page.\n\nBy reviewing these potential issues, you should be able to identify why your DAG isn't appearing in the Web UI. Adjust the `start_date`, ensure all services are running, and check for any import errors. If the problem persists, double-check your Airflow installation and configurations."
