        "content": "I am using Vim for editing Python scripts. I have noticed that Vim automatically removes indentation on Python comments. For instance when I start a new line and type '#' to write a comment, Vim unindents that line. However, if I type 'pass' instead of '#', it indents the line properly. This is causing the comments to get unindented all the way. Here is my .vimrc file configuration:\n\n```\nset tabstop=4\nset smartindent\nset shiftwidth=4\nset expandtab\nset backspace=indent,eol,start\nset scrolloff=3\nset statusline=%f%m%r%h%w\\ [%Y\\ %{&amp;ff}]\\ [%l/%L\\ (%p%%)]\nset laststatus=2\n```\nCan someone help me understand why this is happening and how can I solve it?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing with Vim automatically unindenting comment lines in Python is likely related to the `smartindent` setting. While `smartindent` tries to automatically adjust indentation based on some simple rules, it doesn't always handle Python comments correctly.\n\nHere's how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Switch to `autoindent`:** Replace `smartindent` with `autoindent` in your `.vimrc`. The `autoindent` option will maintain the current line's indentation level when you start a new line, which is often more suitable for Python code, especially when dealing with comments.\n\n   ```vim\n   set autoindent\n   ```\n\n2. **Use `filetype plugin indent on`:** This enables filetype-specific indentation rules. Add this line to your `.vimrc`:\n\n   ```vim\n   filetype plugin indent on\n   ```\n\n3. **Consider using a Python-specific plugin or configuration:** If you frequently work with Python in Vim, you might benefit from a plugin like `vim-python-pep8-indent`. This plugin provides more sophisticated indentation rules that align with Python's PEP 8 style guide.\n\n   You can install it using a plugin manager like Vim-Plug:\n\n   ```vim\n   Plug 'Vimjas/vim-python-pep8-indent'\n   ```\n\nAfter making these changes, restart Vim, and your indentation issues with Python comments should be resolved. If you still encounter problems, ensure that there are no conflicting settings in other parts of your `.vimrc` or in any additional Vim configuration files."
