I want to create a group from a list returned by a Celery task, such that one task will be added to the group for each item in the task result set. Here's a sample code:\n\n```\n@celery.task\ndef get_list(amount):\n    # In reality, fetch a list of items from a db\n    return [i for i in range(amount)]\n\n@celery.task\ndef process_item(item):\n    #do stuff\n    pass\n\nprocess_list = (get_list.s(10) | group(process_item.s(i) for i in ???))\n```\n\nI'm not sure if I'm approaching this correctly, and I think it's not safe to call tasks from within tasks:\n\n```\n@celery.task\ndef process_list():\n    for i in get_list.delay().get():\n        process_item.delay(i)\n```\n\nI don't need the result from the second task."

        "content": "To achieve what you're aiming for, you can use Celery's `chain` and `group` constructs to dynamically create a group of tasks from the list returned by a preceding task. However, since you want to create a group dynamically based on the result of a task, you can take advantage of `chord`, which is essentially a combination of a `group` and a callback task. Here's how you can structure your code:\n\n1. Use the `chord` to handle the list returned by `get_list` and then apply each element to `process_item`.\n2. You'll need an intermediary task to convert the list result into individual tasks for the group.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom celery import Celery, group, chord\n\napp = Celery('tasks', broker='redis://localhost:6379/0')\n\n@app.task\ndef get_list(amount):\n    # In reality, fetch a list of items from a db\n    return [i for i in range(amount)]\n\n@app.task\ndef process_item(item):\n    # Do stuff with the item\n    print(f'Processing item: {item}')\n    # Simulate processing\n    return item * 2\n\n@app.task\ndef aggregate_results(results):\n    # This task is called after all process_item tasks are done\n    print(f'All items processed: {results}')\n    return results\n\n@app.task\ndef process_list(amount):\n    # Create a chord that processes each item in the list returned by get_list\n    return chord(\n        (process_item.s(item) for item in get_list(amount).get())\n    )(aggregate_results.s())\n\n# To trigger the process\nprocess_list.delay(10)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`get_list` Task**: This task generates a list of items.\n- **`process_item` Task**: This task processes each individual item. You mentioned you don't need the result from this task, but it's still part of the workflow.\n- **`aggregate_results` Task**: This is a callback task that runs after all tasks in the group have completed. You can choose to do nothing here if you don't need the results.\n- **`process_list` Task**: It initiates the workflow by calling `get_list`, then uses a `chord` to process each item with `process_item`.\n\nThis setup avoids calling tasks directly from within other tasks, which is generally discouraged in Celery. Instead, it uses the Celery primitives to manage task dependencies and execution flow."
