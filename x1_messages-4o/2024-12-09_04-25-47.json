Here's a step-by-step guide to doing this:\n\n1. **Locate Your PEM File**: Make sure you know the exact path to your PEM file. This file should contain the certificate you want to inspect.\n\n2. **Use the OpenSSL Command**: You can use the following command to extract the expiration date from the certificate:\n\n    ```bash\n    openssl x509 -enddate -noout -in /path/to/your/certificate.pem\n    ```\n\n    Replace `/path/to/your/certificate.pem` with the actual path to your PEM file.\n\n3. **Interpret the Output**: The command will output something like:\n\n    ```\n    notAfter=Nov 5 12:00:00 2023 GMT\n    ```\n\n    This indicates the expiration date and time of the certificate.\n\n4. **Additional Information**: If you want to get more details about the certificate, you can use:\n\n    ```bash\n    openssl x509 -text -noout -in /path/to/your/certificate.pem\n    ```\n\n    This command will display detailed information about the certificate, including the issuer, subject, validity period, etc.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to easily determine the expiration date of your SSL certificate using Bash."
