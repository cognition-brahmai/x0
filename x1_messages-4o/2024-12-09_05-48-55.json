For instance, in a string such as \"I am having a very nice 23!@$ day.\", I want the output to be 7 words.

        "content": "To achieve the desired result of counting words while ignoring numbers, punctuation, and whitespace, you can use the `re` module in Python, which provides support for regular expressions. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef count_words(input_string):\n    # Use regular expression to find words\n    # A word is defined as a sequence of alphabetic characters\n    words = re.findall(r'\\b[a-zA-Z]+\\b', input_string)\n    return len(words)\n\n# Example usage\nstring = \"I am having a very nice 23!@$ day.\"\nword_count = count_words(string)\nprint(f\"The number of words in the string is: {word_count}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- `\\b` denotes a word boundary, ensuring that we're matching whole words.\n- `[a-zA-Z]+` matches sequences of alphabetic characters, effectively ignoring numbers and punctuation.\n- `re.findall` will return a list of all the matches, and the `len` function will give you the count of these matches, which represents the number of words in the string.\n\nThis approach will correctly handle random amounts of spaces, numbers, and punctuation by focusing solely on sequences of alphabetic characters."
