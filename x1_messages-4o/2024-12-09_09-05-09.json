        "content": "Certainly! To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, you can use the Euclidean algorithm. Below is a Python example of how you can modify existing code to implement this algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\n# Example usage:\nnum1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nnum2 = int(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\nresult = gcd(num1, num2)\nprint(f\"The greatest common divisor of {num1} and {num2} is {result}.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**: The `gcd` function takes two parameters, `a` and `b`.\n2. **While Loop**: The loop continues as long as `b` is not zero.\n3. **Swap and Modulo**: Inside the loop, `a` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. This effectively shifts `b` to `a` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` to `b`.\n4. **Return**: Once `b` becomes zero, `a` contains the GCD, which is returned.\n\nYou can input any two numbers to find their GCD using this code."
