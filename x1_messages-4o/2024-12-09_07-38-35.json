The objective is to determine if the uploaded code writes the correct things to stdout, stderr and other files on given input fed into the program's stdin. The results are then displayed to the user. \n\nCurrently, my solution is to spawn the child process using subprocess.Popen(...) with file handles for the stdout, stderr and stdin. The file behind the stdin handle contains the inputs that the program reads during operation, and after the program has terminated, the stdout and stderr files are read and checked for correctness. \n\nHowever, I am unable to combine the given inputs and outputs in a way that the inputs would appear in the same places as they would when running the program from a terminal. For example, for a program like:\n\n```\nprint \"Hello.\"\nname = raw_input(\"Type your name: \")\nprint \"Nice to meet you, %s!\" % (name)\n```\n\nThe contents of the file containing the program's stdout would, after running, be:\n\n```\nHello.\nType your name: \nNice to meet you, Anonymous!\n```\n\nGiven that the contents of the file containing the stdin were Anonymous<LF>. So, in short, for the given example code (and, equivalently, for any other code) I want to achieve a result like:\n\n```\nHello.\nType your name: Anonymous\nNice to meet you, Anonymous!\n```\n\nSo, the problem is to detect when the program is waiting for input.\n\nI have tried several methods but none of them have provided a satisfactory solution. How can I solve this problem?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired effect, where the input appears inline with the prompt in the output, you can simulate an interactive terminal session using the `pexpect` library, which is specifically designed for controlling interactive applications. Here's a way to approach this:\n\n1. **Install Pexpect**: First, make sure you have `pexpect` installed. You can install it via pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pexpect\n   ```\n\n2. **Use Pexpect to Interact with the Child Process**: You can use `pexpect` to spawn the child process and interact with it. Here's how you can modify your approach:\n\n```python\nimport pexpect\n\ndef run_child_process():\n    # Start the child process\n    child = pexpect.spawn('python your_script.py')\n\n    # Interact with the process\n    while True:\n        try:\n            # Wait for the prompt (e.g., \"Type your name: \")\n            # Adjust the timeout as needed\n            child.expect('Type your name:', timeout=10)\n\n            # Send the input to the process\n            child.sendline('Anonymous')\n\n            # Print the output up to this point\n            print(child.before.decode() + 'Anonymous')\n\n        except pexpect.EOF:\n            # End of file reached, process has terminated\n            break\n        except pexpect.TIMEOUT:\n            # Handle timeout, if the process takes too long\n            print(\"Timeout reached while waiting for input prompt.\")\n            break\n\n    # Print any remaining output\n    print(child.read().decode())\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    run_child_process()\n```\n\n### Breakdown:\n\n- **pexpect.spawn**: This spawns the child process, similar to `subprocess.Popen`, but with added capabilities for interacting with the process as if it were a terminal.\n\n- **child.expect**: This waits for specific output from the child process. In this case, it waits for the prompt string \"Type your name:\". Adjust this string to match the actual prompt you're expecting.\n\n- **child.sendline**: This sends input to the child process, simulating a user typing at the terminal.\n\n- **child.before**: This captures the output from the child process up to the point where the expected string (e.g., prompt) was found, allowing you to print it with the input in-line.\n\n- **pexpect.EOF**: This exception is raised when the end of the process output is reached, indicating the process has terminated.\n\n- **pexpect.TIMEOUT**: This exception is raised if the expected output is not found within the specified timeout period.\n\nThis approach should help you achieve the desired behavior, where the input appears in-line with the prompt in the output. Adjust the expected strings and timeout values as needed to fit the specific behavior of the code you are running."
