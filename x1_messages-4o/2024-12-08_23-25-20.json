        "content": "To achieve the desired calculation and rounding in Excel, you can make use of formulas in the cells of your table. Here's how you can structure your Excel table and the formulas to use:\n\n1. **Set Up the Table:**\n\n   You have already set up the table structure, so let's fill in the necessary formulas:\n\n   | Value 1 | Operator | Value 2 | Calculation           | Rounded Value       |\n   |---------|----------|---------|-----------------------|---------------------|\n   | 10      | -        | 4       | `=A2-B2*C2`           | `=ROUNDUP(D2, 0)`   |\n   |         | *        | 2       |                       |                     |\n\n2. **Input the Formulas:**\n\n   - **Calculation Column (D2):** This column calculates the result of the expression `10 - (4*2)`. Enter the formula in cell `D2`:\n     ```excel\n     =A2 - (B3 * C3)\n     ```\n     This formula assumes that the multiplication is intended to happen first due to the parentheses.\n\n   - **Rounded Value Column (E2):** This column rounds the result from the Calculation column up to the nearest integer. Enter the formula in cell `E2`:\n     ```excel\n     =ROUNDUP(D2, 0)\n     ```\n\n3. **Explanation:**\n\n   - **`A2 - (B3 * C3)`:** This computes the expression `10 - (4*2)`.\n   - **`ROUNDUP(D2, 0)`:** This rounds the result of the calculation in cell `D2` up to the nearest integer.\n\nBy setting the formulas accordingly, Excel will automatically calculate and display the results based on your specified operations and rounding requirements."
