        "content": "The error message you're encountering suggests that the file you're trying to open might not be in the expected format for the `xlrd` library. As of version 2.0.0, `xlrd` only supports reading `.xls` files, and even then, it can sometimes have issues with files that aren't strictly Excel 97-2003 format.\n\nHere are some steps to troubleshoot and potentially resolve your issue:\n\n1. **Verify File Format**: Ensure that the file is indeed an `.xls` file and not an `.xlsx` file or another format. You can do this by opening the file in Excel and saving it explicitly as an Excel 97-2003 Workbook (.xls).\n\n2. **Check for HTML File**: Sometimes files with an `.xls` extension are actually HTML files or other text formats that Excel can open. You can open the file in a text editor to see if it starts with HTML tags.\n\n3. **Try Another Library**: If the file is actually an `.xlsx` file or if you're still facing issues, you might want to try using the `openpyxl` library, which supports `.xlsx` files:\n   ```python\n   from openpyxl import load_workbook\n\n   wb = load_workbook(\"Z:\\\\Data\\\\Locates\\\\3.8 locates.xls\", data_only=True)\n   sh = wb.active\n   print(sh.cell(1, 1).value)\n   ```\n\n4. **Convert the File**: If the file is not in a compatible format, you can try opening it in Excel and saving it again as an `.xls` file. This sometimes resolves issues related to file format.\n\n5. **Check for Corruption**: If the file still doesn't open, it might be corrupted. Try opening it in Excel to see if it gives any warnings or errors, and if possible, save a new copy.\n\n6. **Update Libraries**: Ensure you have the latest version of `xlrd` installed. If not, you can update it using:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade xlrd\n   ```\n\nIf none of these steps work, it might be helpful to share more details about the file origin and any other specifics that could help in diagnosing the issue further."
