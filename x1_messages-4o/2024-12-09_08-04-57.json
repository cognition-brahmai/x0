        "content": "The `UnicodeDecodeError` you're encountering is typically due to the Python `open()` function trying to read a file as UTF-8 encoded text, but the file contains bytes that are not valid UTF-8. This often happens if the file is not a text file or is encoded in a different format.\n\nHere are some steps to help you resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check File Type**: First, make sure that the files you're trying to read are indeed text files and are supposed to be read as strings. If they're binary files (like images), you should open them in binary mode.\n\n2. **Open in Binary Mode**: If the files are binary, modify the code to open the file in binary mode:\n   ```python\n   with open(path, 'rb') as file:\n       contents = file.read()\n   ```\n   This reads the file as bytes, which is appropriate for non-text files.\n\n3. **Specify Encoding**: If the files are text but not UTF-8, you might need to specify the correct encoding. For example, if the file is encoded in ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1), you could do:\n   ```python\n   with open(path, 'r', encoding='iso-8859-1') as file:\n       contents = file.read()\n   ```\n   Replace `'iso-8859-1'` with the appropriate encoding if you know it.\n\n4. **File Encoding Detection**: If you're unsure about the file encoding, you can use a library like `chardet` to detect it:\n   ```python\n   import chardet\n   \n   with open(path, 'rb') as file:\n       raw_data = file.read()\n       result = chardet.detect(raw_data)\n       encoding = result['encoding']\n   \n   with open(path, 'r', encoding=encoding) as file:\n       contents = file.read()\n   ```\n\n5. **Python Version**: You're using Python 3.5.2, which is quite outdated. Consider upgrading to a more recent Python version, such as 3.8 or 3.9, as they have better support for handling different encodings.\n\n6. **Check the Input Files**: Ensure that the files in your `data` directory are in the expected format and encoded correctly. If they are images or another type of binary data, ensure you handle them appropriately.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `UnicodeDecodeError` and correctly process your files."
