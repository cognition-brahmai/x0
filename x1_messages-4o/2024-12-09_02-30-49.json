When I try to use sklearn to fit a model, my kernel crashes with the error message: \"OMP: Error #15: Initializing libiomp5md.dll, but found mk2iomp5md.dll already initialized.\" This error suggests that multiple copies of the OpenMP runtime have been linked into the program, which can cause performance issues or incorrect results. The code I'm running is a simple fit of a linear_model.SGDClassifier(loss='log'), and the same code was working fine on Canopy's 32-bit version. How do I resolve this error?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"OMP: Error #15: Initializing libiomp5md.dll, but found mk2iomp5md.dll already initialized,\" is related to conflicting OpenMP runtime libraries, which often occur when different packages use their own version of this library. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check for Conflicting Libraries**: It's possible that some installed libraries are bringing in different versions of the OpenMP runtime. You can try finding these libraries using a tool like `Dependency Walker` on Windows to check which DLLs are being loaded by your Python executable.\n\n2. **Environment Variable Workaround**: Set the `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK` environment variable to `TRUE` to allow multiple OpenMP libraries to be used. This is a temporary workaround and not a permanent fix, as it might lead to performance issues:\n   - On Windows, you can set this environment variable by running the following command in the Command Prompt before running your script:\n     ```shell\n     set KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE\n     ```\n\n3. **Update or Reinstall Packages**: Ensure all your packages, especially those using OpenMP, are up to date. You might also want to try reinstalling `scikit-learn` and any other packages that could be using OpenMP:\n   ```shell\n   pip uninstall scikit-learn\n   pip install scikit-learn\n   ```\n\n4. **Use Anaconda/Miniconda**: If you aren't already, consider using Anaconda or Miniconda for managing your Python environments. They handle binary dependencies more gracefully and might avoid this issue altogether:\n   - Create a new environment and install the necessary packages:\n     ```shell\n     conda create -n myenv python=3.8\n     conda activate myenv\n     conda install scikit-learn\n     ```\n\n5. **Check for Duplicate DLLs**: Sometimes, multiple copies of the DLLs might exist in different locations (e.g., system path, Python's `site-packages`). Ensure that only one version exists in your path.\n\n6. **Rebuild the Environment**: If nothing else works, you might want to rebuild your Python environment from scratch. This involves uninstalling Python and all associated packages and then reinstalling them.\n\n7. **Contact Support or Forums**: If the issue persists, consider reaching out to Enthought support or community forums such as Stack Overflow or GitHub issues for further assistance.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the OpenMP initialization error and get your model training working again."
