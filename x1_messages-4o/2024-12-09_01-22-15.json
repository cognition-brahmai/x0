I have a few questions about this methodology. Firstly, the SHA1 encoding used here is 40 characters in hexadecimal; I'm trying to understand the kind of probability being computed in the expression. Secondly, why is there a \"+1\" in the expression \"(MAX_NUM_IMAGES_PER_CLASS + 1)\"? Does changing the value of MAX_NUM_IMAGES_PER_CLASS have an effect on the quality of the split? Lastly, could you explain the quality of the split obtained by this method and if it is a recommended way of splitting datasets?"

        "content": "Sure, let's break down your questions one by one regarding the TensorFlow image retraining script.\n\n### 1. SHA1 Encoding and Probability Computation\n\nThe SHA1 algorithm is often used in this context to generate a seemingly random but deterministic hash value from a string (usually the file path or file name). This is useful in data splitting because it allows you to consistently split data across different runs without having to store or rely on random numbers, which can vary between executions.\n\nSHA1 produces a 40-character hexadecimal hash, which can be converted to a large integer. By dividing this integer by a maximum possible value (the largest possible SHA1 value), you can obtain a float between 0 and 1. This float is then used to determine into which dataset (training, validation, or test) the item should fall.\n\n### 2. The \"+1\" in \"(MAX_NUM_IMAGES_PER_CLASS + 1)\"\n\nThe expression `(MAX_NUM_IMAGES_PER_CLASS + 1)` is typically used to avoid division by zero errors and ensure that the range used in any computations is non-zero. This factor does not directly affect the quality of the split but ensures that all images are considered for the split. \n\nChanging `MAX_NUM_IMAGES_PER_CLASS` can impact the dataset if it acts as a cap, implying a limit on the number of images per class. If you set it lower than the number of available images, you'll only use up to that number of images per class, potentially affecting the model's ability to generalize.\n\n### 3. Quality of the Split\n\nThe method using SHA1 hashing for dataset splitting provides a deterministic and reproducible way to split your datasets, which is particularly useful for experiments where consistency is crucial. The quality of the split is generally good for typical use cases, as it ensures that the same data points consistently belong to the same splits across different runs.\n\nHowever, this method does not account for stratification, which means it doesn't ensure that each subset has the same distribution of classes as the whole dataset. If your dataset is imbalanced, this could lead to some splits having a very different class distribution than the original dataset, which might not be ideal for training.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- **Use Stratification**: If class distribution is a concern, consider stratified splitting to maintain class balance across sets.\n- **Reproducibility**: The hashing method is excellent for reproducibility across experiments.\n- **Custom Needs**: Depending on your specific dataset characteristics and project requirements, you might choose other splitting strategies like random splitting with stratification or k-fold cross-validation.\n\nIn summary, while this splitting method is robust and reproducible, it's important to consider your dataset's characteristics and adjust the method accordingly to ensure the best results for your model training and evaluation."
