        "content": "In Django 1.0.2, the \"+\" icon (add another option) appears next to a ForeignKey field in the admin interface if the user has permission to add the related object. However, as you mentioned, even when a user doesn't have permission to add the related object, the icon still appears, leading to a \"Permission denied\" error upon clicking it. \n\nTo remove the \"add another\" option for a specific ForeignKey field, you can override the formfield for that ForeignKey in your admin class. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Override the formfield for the ForeignKey in your admin class:**\n\n   You can override the `formfield_for_foreignkey` method in your ModelAdmin class to customize the form field for the ForeignKey. You can set `can_add_related` to `False` to remove the \"add another\" option.\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom django import forms\nfrom .models import A, B\n\nclass AAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    def formfield_for_foreignkey(self, db_field, request, **kwargs):\n        if db_field.name == \"b\":  # assuming 'b' is the ForeignKey field to model B\n            kwargs[\"widget\"] = forms.Select\n        return super().formfield_for_foreignkey(db_field, request, **kwargs)\n\nadmin.site.register(A, AAdmin)\n```\n\n2. **Ensure permissions are set correctly:**\n\n   Double-check that the user permissions are set correctly in the Django admin for the models involved. If the user truly should not have add permissions for the related model, make sure these permissions are correctly configured.\n\n3. **Consider upgrading Django:**\n\n   It's worth noting that Django 1.0.2 is an outdated version, and many improvements and bug fixes have been made in later versions. If possible, consider upgrading to a more recent version of Django to take advantage of these improvements, including better permissions handling.\n\nBy following the steps above, you should be able to remove the \"add another\" option from the ForeignKey field in the Django admin interface for users who do not have permission to add the related object."
