The elements in the first row are co-prime with those in the second row.\n2. The sum of the elements in each column is a prime number.\n\nLet's explore the possibilities:\n\nFirst, identify which prime numbers are co-prime with each other:\n- 2 is co-prime with 3 and 5.\n- 3 is co-prime with 2 and 5.\n- 5 is co-prime with 2 and 3.\n\nNext, arrange the numbers in the matrix:\n\nLet's start with the first row being [2, 3].\n\nThe second row must be co-prime with the first row:\n- Choose [5, 2] for the second row.\n\nNow, let's check the sum of the columns:\n- First column: 2 + 5 = 7 (prime)\n- Second column: 3 + 2 = 5 (prime)\n\nThis satisfies all given conditions. Therefore, the matrix is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 3 \\\\\n5 & 2 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe third row doesn't affect the conditions as it wasn't specified in the question, so it can be any arrangement of the remaining numbers or even repeat numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 3 \\\\\n5 & 2 \\\\\n\\text{Any} & \\text{Any} \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]"
