Here's an example of what I am working with:\n\n```python\ns =((1,0,0,0,),(2,3,0,0,),(4,5,6,0,),(7,8,9,10,))\n```\n\nI am trying to convert this tuple of tuples into a pandas DataFrame, where each tuple is a row in the DataFrame. The DataFrame should look like this:\n\n```python\n   1  2  3   4\n1  1  0  0   0\n2  2  3  0   0\n3  4  5  6   0\n4  7  8  9  10\n```\n\nI attempted using `DataFrame(t)` but it doesn't seem to work. Is there a way to achieve this conversion in a clean, efficient and pythonic way? Bear in mind that this list can grow with more zeros appended in the upper-triangular if we think of `s` as a tuple of rows."

        "content": "To convert a tuple of tuples into a pandas DataFrame where each inner tuple represents a row, you can directly pass the tuple to the `DataFrame` constructor. You can then set the column and row labels as needed. Here\u2019s how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Given tuple of tuples\ns = ((1, 0, 0, 0), (2, 3, 0, 0), (4, 5, 6, 0), (7, 8, 9, 10))\n\n# Convert the tuple of tuples into a DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(s)\n\n# Set the column labels\ndf.columns = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n# Set the row index starting from 1\ndf.index = range(1, len(df) + 1)\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThis will produce the desired DataFrame:\n\n```\n   1  2  3   4\n1  1  0  0   0\n2  2  3  0   0\n3  4  5  6   0\n4  7  8  9  10\n```\n\nHere's a quick breakdown of what each step does:\n\n- `pd.DataFrame(s)` converts the tuple of tuples into a DataFrame.\n- `df.columns = [1, 2, 3, 4]` sets the column labels to start from 1.\n- `df.index = range(1, len(df) + 1)` sets the row index to start from 1, matching your desired output. \n\nThis approach is clean and efficient, leveraging pandas' capabilities to handle such data transformations."
