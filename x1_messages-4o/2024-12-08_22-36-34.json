In each case, the solution is the result of applying the specified operation to the numbers provided.\n\nFor the equation involving squaring, \"Skill: Square, Equation: 9^2 = ?\", you apply the squaring operation to the number 9. Squaring a number means multiplying the number by itself:\n\n\\[ 9^2 = 9 \\times 9 = 81 \\]\n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation \"9^2 = ?\" is 81."
