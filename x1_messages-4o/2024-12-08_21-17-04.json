        "content": "To generate sheet music from notes using MATLAB, you can use the `midi` package to create a MIDI file, which can then be converted into sheet music using external software. Below is a MATLAB code snippet that demonstrates how to create a MIDI file from the given notes. This snippet includes tempo, volume, and note duration considerations:\n\n```matlab\n% Add the MIDI package to your MATLAB path if you haven't already\n% Download from: https://github.com/kts/matlab-midi\n\n% Define the notes and their properties\nnotes = {'A#4', 'D4', 'C#4', 'E4', 'F4', 'A#4', 'D4', 'F4', 'G4', 'A4'};\ndurations = [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]; % in beats\nvolume = 80; % MIDI volume (0-127)\ntempo = 120; % beats per minute\n\n% Create a MIDI structure\nmidiNew = miditoolbox.midifile();\ntrack = miditoolbox.miditrack();\n\n% Calculate the number of ticks per beat\nticksPerBeat = 480;\nticksPerSec = (tempo / 60) * ticksPerBeat;\n\n% Add notes to the track\ncurrentTick = 0;\nfor i = 1:length(notes)\n    pitch = miditoolbox.notename2pitch(notes{i});\n    durationTicks = durations(i) * ticksPerBeat;\n    \n    % Create note-on event\n    noteOn = miditoolbox.midievent('NoteOn', currentTick, pitch, volume);\n    track.add(noteOn);\n    \n    % Create note-off event after the duration\n    currentTick = currentTick + durationTicks;\n    noteOff = miditoolbox.midievent('NoteOff', currentTick, pitch, 0);\n    track.add(noteOff);\nend\n\n% Add the track to the MIDI file\nmidiNew.add(track);\n\n% Write the MIDI file\nmiditoolbox.write(midiNew, 'generated_music.mid');\n\n% To convert the MIDI file to sheet music, use software like MuseScore or any other MIDI-to-sheet music converter.\n```\n\n### Steps to Use This Code:\n1. **Download the MIDI Toolbox**: This code uses the MIDI Toolbox for MATLAB, which you can download from [GitHub](https://github.com/kts/matlab-midi).\n2. **Execute the Code**: Run the MATLAB code to generate a MIDI file named `generated_music.mid`.\n3. **Convert to Sheet Music**: Use software like MuseScore to open the MIDI file and convert it to sheet music.\n\nThis code provides a basic framework to generate a MIDI file with specified notes, tempo, volume, and durations, which can be further modified or expanded as needed."
