        "content": "In Django 1.9, the `syncdb` command was indeed deprecated and removed. The functionality it provided is now handled by the `migrate` command. Here\u2019s how you can use it:\n\n1. **Migrate Command**: You should use the `migrate` command to apply migrations, which include both schema changes and data migrations.\n\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py migrate\n   ```\n\n   The `migrate` command is more powerful than `syncdb` as it also applies migrations for apps that have them. It is part of Django\u2019s migration framework introduced in Django 1.7.\n\n2. **Initial Migration**: If you're starting a new project or adding a new app, you'll first need to create migrations for your models before running `migrate`. Use the `makemigrations` command to create initial migration files:\n\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py makemigrations\n   ```\n\n   This command will create the necessary migration files for your models.\n\n3. **Applying Migrations**: Once your migrations are created, you can apply them using the `migrate` command as mentioned above.\n\n4. **Database Initialization**: If you're setting up your database for the first time, running `migrate` will create the necessary tables and apply any initial data migrations.\n\nBy using `makemigrations` and `migrate`, you'll have more control over your database schema and can handle changes more gracefully than with the old `syncdb` command."
