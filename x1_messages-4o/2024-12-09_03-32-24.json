How can I adjust this code to allow for repeated letters in my output list?"

        "content": "To generate a list of four random colors from your defined list, allowing for repetitions, you should use the `random.choices()` function instead of `random.sample()`. The `random.choices()` function allows for selections with replacement, meaning it can choose the same element multiple times. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ncolors = [\"R\", \"G\", \"B\", \"Y\"]\nrandom_colors = random.choices(colors, k=4)\nprint(random_colors)\n```\n\nThis will give you a list of four colors, where each color is randomly selected from the list `colors`, and repetitions are possible."
