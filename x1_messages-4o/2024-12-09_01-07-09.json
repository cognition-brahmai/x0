I'm aware it stands for \"Carriage Return\" but I couldn't figure out its use in my context. Also, I noticed that removing \"\\r\" breaks the code. Why does this happen? I am running this script on Linux. Here's my script:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport os\nimport telnetlib\nfrom time import sleep\n\nhost = \"192.168.1.1\"\nuser = \"USER\"\npassword = \"PASSWORD\"\ncmd = \"system restart\"\n\ntn = telnetlib.Telnet(host)\nsleep(1)\n\ntn.read_until(\"Login: \")\ntn.write(user + \"\\n\\r\")\nsleep(1)\n\ntn.read_until(\"Password: \")\ntn.write(password + \"\\n\\r\")\nsleep(1)\n\ntn.write(cmd + \"\\n\\r\")\n```"

        "content": "In your script, the `\\r` character is being used to send a \"Carriage Return\" along with a newline character (`\\n`) as part of the commands sent over the Telnet connection. This combination (`\\n\\r`) is often used to indicate the end of a line or command, especially in network protocols like Telnet.\n\n### Why is `\\r` used here?\n\n1. **Protocol Requirement**: The Telnet protocol often expects commands to be terminated by a specific sequence of characters. In many cases, this is a combination of `\\r` (carriage return) and `\\n` (newline or line feed). The combination `\\r\\n` is a common convention used to signify the end of a command or line in network communications.\n\n2. **Device Expectation**: Your router's Telnet interface may be expecting commands to be terminated with both a carriage return and a newline. In some systems, `\\n` alone might not be sufficient to indicate the end of a command, which is why `\\r` is included.\n\n### Why does removing `\\r` break the code?\n\n1. **Command Recognition**: The router's Telnet server might not recognize the end of a command if it doesn't receive the expected `\\r\\n` sequence. This means the server may not process the command correctly or might be waiting for the correct termination sequence.\n\n2. **Different Interpretations**: Different systems and applications interpret newline characters differently. On Unix-based systems, `\\n` is typically used as a newline character, while on some network protocols and systems, the combination `\\r\\n` is required to properly interpret the end of a command or input.\n\n### General Use of `\\r`:\n\n- **Windows vs. Unix**: In Windows, text files traditionally use `\\r\\n` to denote line breaks, while Unix/Linux systems use `\\n` alone.\n- **Network Protocols**: Many network protocols, including HTTP and SMTP, require `\\r\\n` to indicate the end of a line or command.\n- **Legacy Systems**: Some older systems and applications expect `\\r` as part of their input handling due to historical conventions.\n\nIn summary, the use of `\\r` in your script is essential for ensuring that the commands are properly terminated and recognized by your router's Telnet interface. Removing it breaks the expected command sequence, resulting in the router not processing the commands as intended."
