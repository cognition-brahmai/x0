        "content": "Creating a program to determine the winner of a card game with 3 players involves several steps. The exact implementation will depend on the rules of the game you're planning to simulate. For simplicity, let's assume a basic card game where each player draws a single card, and the player with the highest card wins. We'll use Python for this example.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# Define the deck of cards\n# For simplicity, let's define a deck with numbers 1 to 13 (representing Ace to King)\ndeck = list(range(1, 14)) * 4  # Four suits\n\ndef draw_card():\n    \"\"\"Draw a random card from the deck.\"\"\"\n    card = random.choice(deck)\n    deck.remove(card)\n    return card\n\ndef determine_winner(scores):\n    \"\"\"Determine the winner based on scores.\"\"\"\n    max_score = max(scores)\n    winners = [index + 1 for index, score in enumerate(scores) if score == max_score]\n    return winners\n\ndef play_game():\n    # Each player draws a card\n    player_scores = [draw_card() for _ in range(3)]\n    print(f\"Player 1 drew: {player_scores[0]}\")\n    print(f\"Player 2 drew: {player_scores[1]}\")\n    print(f\"Player 3 drew: {player_scores[2]}\")\n\n    # Determine the winner(s)\n    winners = determine_winner(player_scores)\n    if len(winners) == 1:\n        print(f\"Player {winners[0]} wins!\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"It's a tie between players: {', '.join(map(str, winners))}\")\n\n# Play the game\nplay_game()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Deck Initialization**: We create a list representing a standard deck of cards with values 1 through 13. Each number is repeated four times to account for the four suits.\n\n2. **Drawing a Card**: The `draw_card()` function selects a random card from the deck and removes it to simulate drawing a card.\n\n3. **Determine the Winner**: The `determine_winner()` function compares the drawn cards and identifies the player(s) with the highest card value.\n\n4. **Gameplay**: In the `play_game()` function, each player draws a card, and the program prints out the card values. It then determines and announces the winner.\n\n### Note:\nThis example assumes the game is simple and doesn't account for suits or more complex rules. Adjust the rules and logic according to your specific card game's requirements."
