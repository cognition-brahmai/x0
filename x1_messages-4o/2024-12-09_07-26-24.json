However, I want the integer `0` and empty string `''` to not cause a return of `True`. I've tried using the `any()` function, but it doesn't seem to be working as expected. Here's the code I've tried:\n\n```python\nlist_1 = [0, 1, None, 4]\nlist_2 = [0, 1, 3, 4]\n\nany(list_1) is None\n# Output: False\n\nany(list_2) is None\n# Output: False\n```\n\nDespite having `None` in `list_1`, the function returns `False`. What am I doing wrong, and how can I solve this?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is due to a misunderstanding of how the `any()` function works. The `any()` function checks if at least one element in the iterable is truthy, which includes non-zero numbers, non-empty strings, and other truthy values, but it does not directly check for `None`.\n\nTo check if any item in the list is `None`, you can use a generator expression within the `any()` function. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nlist_1 = [0, 1, None, 4]\nlist_2 = [0, 1, 3, 4]\n\n# Check if any item in the list is None\nhas_none_1 = any(item is None for item in list_1)\nhas_none_2 = any(item is None for item in list_2)\n\nprint(has_none_1)  # Output: True\nprint(has_none_2)  # Output: False\n```\n\nIn this code, `any(item is None for item in list_1)` will iterate over each element in `list_1`, checking if it is `None`. If any element is `None`, `any()` will return `True`; otherwise, it will return `False`."
