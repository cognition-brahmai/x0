However, I am having trouble reproducing the same output in Python 3. I've tried using: `print(\"a=%d,b=%d\") % (f(x,n),g(x,n))`, but it does not seem to work. How can I print in Python 3 in a way that is similar to `printf` in C?"

        "content": "In Python 3, the `print` statement from Python 2 has been replaced by the `print()` function. This means that you need to adjust how you format the string to be printed. The error you're encountering is because the string formatting part is outside the `print()` function in your attempt.\n\nHere's how you can format the string using the `%` operator, similar to how you did in Python 2, but correctly place it inside the `print()` function:\n\n```python\nprint(\"a=%d,b=%d\" % (f(x, n), g(x, n)))\n```\n\nAlternatively, Python 3 introduced a more modern way of string formatting using the `str.format()` method and f-strings (formatted string literals), which can be more readable and flexible:\n\nUsing `str.format()` method:\n```python\nprint(\"a={}, b={}\".format(f(x, n), g(x, n)))\n```\n\nUsing f-strings (available in Python 3.6 and later):\n```python\nprint(f\"a={f(x, n)}, b={g(x, n)}\")\n```\n\nThese methods allow you to easily format strings with variables and are often preferred in Python 3 for their readability and ease of use."
