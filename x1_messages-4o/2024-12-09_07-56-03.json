        "content": "It looks like you're encountering an issue with the `psycopg2` module, which is the PostgreSQL adapter for Python. This is a common problem, especially when setting up Django with PostgreSQL for the first time. Let's go through some steps to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify the Installation of psycopg2**: \n   Make sure that `psycopg2` is installed in the Python environment you are using. You can check this by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip freeze | grep psycopg2\n   ```\n\n   If you don't see `psycopg2` listed, you need to install it using:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install psycopg2\n   ```\n\n   For environments where you might be using Python 2.6, you may need to specify an older version of `psycopg2` that is compatible with your version of Python. However, it's worth noting that Python 2.6 is quite outdated and upgrading to a newer version of Python and Django would be beneficial.\n\n2. **Check Python Environment**:\n   Ensure that the Python interpreter you are using is the one where `psycopg2` is installed. If you have multiple Python versions, this might be causing the issue. You can specify the Python interpreter directly by using:\n\n   ```bash\n   python2.6 manage.py syncdb\n   ```\n\n   Or, if you are using a virtual environment, make sure it is activated:\n\n   ```bash\n   source /path/to/venv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n3. **PostgreSQL Service**:\n   Ensure that your PostgreSQL service is running. You can start it using MacPorts with:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo port load postgresql\n   ```\n\n   Or check its status to ensure it's running:\n\n   ```bash\n   pg_ctl status\n   ```\n\n4. **Connection Details**:\n   Double-check your `settings.py` configuration. Since you're running PostgreSQL locally, leaving `DATABASE_HOST` and `DATABASE_PORT` empty is generally fine, but ensure that `DATABASE_USER` and `DATABASE_NAME` are correct and that the user has been granted necessary permissions on the database.\n\n5. **Python Version**:\n   Consider upgrading Python to a more recent version if possible. Python 2.6 is no longer supported, and newer versions of Django and psycopg2 may not work with it. Python 2.7 is the last version of Python 2, or even better, consider moving to Python 3.x.\n\n6. **MacPorts Environment**:\n   If you've installed everything through MacPorts, ensure that your environment variables are correctly pointing to the MacPorts installed binaries:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH\n   ```\n\n   You might also need to ensure the correct library paths:\n\n   ```bash\n   export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib\n   ```\n\nAfter checking all these, try running `python manage.py syncdb` again. If you encounter any specific errors during these steps, please provide those details for further assistance."
