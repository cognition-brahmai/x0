        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that the CUDA runtime library (`libcudart.so.5.0`) is not being found when you run your program under GDB. There are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify Library Path**:\n   Ensure that the path to the CUDA libraries is correctly set in your `.bashrc` and that the libraries are indeed present in the specified location. You can do this by checking if the `libcudart.so.5.0` file is located in `/usr/local/cuda/lib64`.\n\n   ```bash\n   ls /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudart.so.5.0\n   ```\n\n   If the file isn't there, you might need to install or reinstall the CUDA toolkit.\n\n2. **Source .bashrc**:\n   Make sure the `.bashrc` changes are applied in your current shell session. You can do this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bashrc\n   ```\n\n3. **Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH in GDB**:\n   Since you're using `M-x gdb` (likely from Emacs), the environment variables set in your shell may not be passed to GDB. You can set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` directly in GDB before running your program:\n\n   ```bash\n   (gdb) set env LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n   ```\n\n4. **Check CUDA Version**:\n   Make sure the version of CUDA you're using matches the version of the libraries you're trying to load. If you're using a newer version of CUDA, the library version might be different (e.g., `libcudart.so.11.0`). Adjust your paths accordingly.\n\n5. **System-wide Library Path**:\n   If you want the system to always recognize the CUDA libraries, you can add the CUDA library path to your system's library path configuration:\n\n   Create a file in `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/` named `cuda.conf` with the following content:\n\n   ```bash\n   /usr/local/cuda/lib64\n   ```\n\n   Then, update the linker cache by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo ldconfig\n   ```\n\n6. **Check Your Emacs Configuration**:\n   If you're using Emacs to run GDB, ensure that Emacs is aware of your environment variables. You can start Emacs from a terminal where the environment variables are already set, or you might need to configure Emacs to source your `.bashrc`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the library loading issue when running your CUDA program under GDB."
