I couldn't find much about it on the internet, except a few posts from 2012 stating OpenCV wasn't ported to be used in Python 3.x. However, now it's 2014 and after installing the latest OpenCV 2.4.x and copying the `cv2.pyd` file to `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Python333\\Lib\\site-packages`, I still get an error when trying to import it in Python IDLE. The error reads: \n\n```python\n>>> import cv2\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<pyshell#0>\", line 1, in <module>\n    import cv2\nImportError: DLL load failed: %1 ist keine zul\u00e4ssige Win32-Anwendung.\n```"

        "content": "As of 2014, OpenCV had started to support Python 3.x, including Python 3.3, but there were still some challenges that users faced when installing and configuring it correctly. The error message you're encountering, \"DLL load failed: %1 is not a valid Win32 application,\" typically indicates that there is a mismatch between the architecture of Python and the OpenCV binary you are attempting to use. Here are a few things you might consider to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Architecture Mismatch**: Ensure that both Python and OpenCV are of the same architecture. If you are using a 32-bit version of Python, you need to have the 32-bit version of OpenCV. Similarly, if you have a 64-bit version of Python, you need the 64-bit version of OpenCV.\n\n2. **Correct Installation**: Make sure that you have installed OpenCV correctly. The recommended approach would be to use a package manager like `pip` to install OpenCV, as this will handle the dependencies and architecture differences for you. You can do this by running the command:\n   ```bash\n   pip install opencv-python\n   ```\n\n3. **Dependencies**: OpenCV might have some additional dependencies which need to be installed. Ensure that any required libraries (such as NumPy) are installed and compatible with your version of Python.\n\n4. **Check Python Path**: Ensure that the Python environment you are using is the one where OpenCV is installed. Sometimes having multiple Python installations can lead to confusion over which environment is being used.\n\n5. **Try a Different Version**: If you're still having issues, you might want to try using a slightly different version of Python or OpenCV to see if compatibility issues are resolved.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue you're experiencing without needing to downgrade to Python 2.7. However, if none of these solutions work and you must use Python 3.3, you might consider using a virtual environment to manage dependencies and ensure compatibility."
