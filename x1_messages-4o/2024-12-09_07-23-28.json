The server should be able to support concurrent access, allowing a client to connect once and continually send and receive data.

        "content": "To create a simple multithreaded socket server in Python that remembers its clients and allows them to connect once and continually send and receive data, you can use the `socket` and `threading` libraries. This involves setting up a server that listens for incoming connections and spawns a new thread for each client, allowing for concurrent access.\n\nHere's a basic implementation of such a server:\n\n```python\nimport socket\nimport threading\n\ndef handle_client(client_socket):\n    \"\"\"Function to handle client connection.\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        try:\n            # Receive data from the client\n            data = client_socket.recv(1024)\n            if not data:\n                break  # If no data is received, break the loop\n            print(f\"Received: {data.decode('utf-8')}\")\n            \n            # Echo the received data back to the client\n            client_socket.send(data)\n        except ConnectionResetError:\n            break  # Handle client disconnecting abruptly\n\n    client_socket.close()\n    print(\"Client disconnected\")\n\ndef main():\n    server_ip = '0.0.0.0'  # Listen on all available interfaces\n    server_port = 50000\n    server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n    \n    # Bind the socket to the address and port\n    server.bind((server_ip, server_port))\n    server.listen(5)  # Listen for up to 5 connections\n    print(f\"Server listening on {server_ip}:{server_port}\")\n\n    while True:\n        # Accept a new client connection\n        client_socket, addr = server.accept()\n        print(f\"Accepted connection from {addr}\")\n\n        # Create a new thread to handle the client connection\n        client_handler = threading.Thread(target=handle_client, args=(client_socket,))\n        client_handler.start()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How the Server Works:\n- The server listens on all available interfaces on port `50000`.\n- When a client connects, it spawns a new thread to handle the client's connection using the `handle_client` function.\n- The `handle_client` function continuously receives data from the client, echoes it back, and prints it to the console.\n- If the client disconnects or sends no data, the connection is closed.\n\n### Usage:\n1. Run the server script in a terminal.\n2. Run the provided client script in another terminal or use any other client that connects to the server.\n3. Enter messages in the client terminal, and they will be echoed back by the server.\n\nThis setup allows multiple clients to connect to the server simultaneously, each handled by a separate thread, enabling concurrent data communication."
