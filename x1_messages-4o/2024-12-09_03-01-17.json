        "content": "In PyTorch, is it possible to use nn.Module layers directly in the forward() function? Normally, we declare all the layers we want to use in the constructor and define how the model is going to be run, from input to output, in the forward function. However, I'm curious if it's possible to call those predefined/built-in nn.Modules directly in the forward() function, similar to the Keras function API style. I've constructed a TestModel in this way and it did run successfully, but the training loss descended slowly compared to the conventional way. Here is my code:\n\n```python\nimport torch.nn as nn\nfrom cnn import CNN\n\nclass TestModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.num_embeddings = 2020\n        self.embedding_dim = 51\n\n    def forward(self, input):\n        x = nn.Embedding(self.num_embeddings, self.embedding_dim)(input)\n        # CNN is a customized class and nn.Module subclassed\n        # we will ignore the arguments for its instantiation \n        x = CNN(...)(x)\n        x = nn.ReLu()(x)\n        x = nn.Dropout(p=0.2)(x)\n        return output = x\n```"

        "content": "Yes, it is technically possible to use `nn.Module` layers directly in the `forward()` function as you've done in your code snippet. However, this approach is generally not recommended for several reasons:\n\n1. **Efficiency and Reusability**: By creating layers directly in the `forward()` function, you instantiate new layers every time `forward()` is called. This can be inefficient, especially for large models, because it repeatedly allocates and deallocates memory. It also makes it difficult to reuse weights or maintain state across calls.\n\n2. **Parameter Tracking**: PyTorch's `nn.Module` is designed to automatically track model parameters when they are defined as instance variables. If you instantiate layers inside the `forward()` method, PyTorch will not track the parameters of those layers for you, making it difficult to access them later (e.g., when saving or loading the model).\n\n3. **Model Consistency**: By defining layers in the constructor, you ensure that the model's architecture remains consistent. Defining them in `forward()` can lead to subtle bugs if the model's structure inadvertently changes between calls.\n\n4. **Training Behavior**: As you've noticed, using this approach can affect training dynamics. The creation of new layers in each forward pass might lead to unexpected behavior, such as slower convergence, because the model's weights are not being updated consistently.\n\nIf your goal is to emulate Keras' functional API style, you might consider using a more functional approach while still adhering to PyTorch's best practices. You can define the layers in the constructor and use them in `forward()` in a way that resembles the Keras functional API:\n\n```python\nimport torch.nn as nn\nfrom cnn import CNN\n\nclass TestModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(2020, 51)\n        self.cnn = CNN(...)\n        self.relu = nn.ReLU()\n        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(p=0.2)\n\n    def forward(self, input):\n        x = self.embedding(input)\n        x = self.cnn(x)\n        x = self.relu(x)\n        x = self.dropout(x)\n        return x\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that the layers are instantiated once and reused, leading to more efficient and consistent training behavior."
