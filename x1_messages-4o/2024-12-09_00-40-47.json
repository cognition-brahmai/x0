How can I set the line color in Plotly?"

        "content": "To set the color of a line in Plotly, you need to use the `line` attribute within your `go.Scatter` trace. The `line` attribute has a `color` property that you can set to your desired color. In your case, you're looking to set the line color to `#ffe476`.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nfrom plotly.subplots import make_subplots\n\nfig = make_subplots(rows=2, cols=1, subplot_titles=('Plot 1', 'Plot 2'))\n\n# plot the first line of the first plot with specified color\nfig.append_trace(go.Scatter(x=self.x_axis_pd, y=self.y_1, mode='lines+markers', name='line#1',\n                            line=dict(color='#ffe476')), row=1, col=1)\n\n# show the figure\nfig.show()\n```\n\nIn this code, the `line=dict(color='#ffe476')` part is what specifies the color of the line. You can adjust the color value to any valid CSS color code to change the appearance of the line."
