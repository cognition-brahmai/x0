        "content": "To efficiently iterate over all `.asm` files in a given directory and perform actions on them, you can use a scripting language like Python, which provides powerful libraries for file handling and manipulation. Below is a simple example using Python:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Define the directory containing .asm files\ndirectory = '/path/to/directory'\n\n# Iterate over all files in the directory\nfor filename in os.listdir(directory):\n    # Check if the file has a .asm extension\n    if filename.endswith('.asm'):\n        # Construct the full file path\n        file_path = os.path.join(directory, filename)\n        \n        # Perform your desired actions on the file\n        # For example, read the file content\n        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n            content = file.read()\n            # Process the content or perform actions\n            print(f\"Processing file: {filename}\")\n            # Example action: print the first line\n            first_line = content.split('\\n')[0]\n            print(f\"First line: {first_line}\")\n```\n\n### Steps Explained:\n\n1. **Import `os` Module**: This module provides a way of using operating system-dependent functionality like reading or writing to the file system.\n\n2. **Specify the Directory**: Define the path to the directory where your `.asm` files are located.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Files**: Use `os.listdir()` to get a list of all files in the specified directory.\n\n4. **Filter `.asm` Files**: Check if the file ends with the `.asm` extension using `str.endswith()`.\n\n5. **Perform Actions**: Once you have identified an `.asm` file, you can open it and perform any actions you need, such as reading its content, modifying it, or executing some processing logic.\n\n6. **Close Files**: Using the `with open()` syntax automatically takes care of closing the file after the block is executed.\n\nThis approach is both straightforward and efficient for processing multiple files in a directory. If you need more advanced file matching capabilities, consider using modules like `glob` or `pathlib` in Python."
