I have a DataFrame and I plot it as histograms using the following code:\n\n```python\ndata = DataFrame(np.random.randn(500).reshape(100,5), columns=list('abcde'))\naxes = data.hist(sharey=True, sharex=True)\n```\n\nI tried using the title keyword in the hist command to add a title to the entire collection (i.e., `title='My collection of histogram plots'`), but that did not work. I have also managed to add text to one of the axes in an ipython notebook with the following code:\n\n```python\naxes[0,1].text(0.5, 1.4,'My collection of histogram plots', horizontalalignment='center', verticalalignment='center', transform=axes[0,1].transAxes)\n```\n\nHowever, this seems like a bit of a workaround. Is there a more straightforward way to add a title to the entire collection of plots?"

        "content": "To add a title to the entire collection of histogram plots generated by `pandas.DataFrame.hist()`, you can use the `suptitle` method from Matplotlib. This method allows you to set a title for the entire figure, which encompasses all the subplots created by the `hist` method. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom pandas import DataFrame\n\n# Create a DataFrame with random data\ndata = DataFrame(np.random.randn(500).reshape(100, 5), columns=list('abcde'))\n\n# Generate histograms for the DataFrame\naxes = data.hist(sharey=True, sharex=True)\n\n# Add a title to the entire figure\nplt.suptitle('My collection of histogram plots', fontsize=16)\n\n# Display the plots\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this code, `plt.suptitle()` is used to add a title to the entire figure that contains all of your subplots. The `fontsize` parameter can be adjusted to change the size of the title text if desired. This approach is clean and straightforward, and it avoids the need for workarounds involving adding text to individual axes."
