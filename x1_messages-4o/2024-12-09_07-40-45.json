I am able to plot points and planes separately however, I am unable to plot them at the same time. The points do not appear on the plot when I try to do so. Here is the code I have tried:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\n\npoint  = np.array([1, 2, 3])\nnormal = np.array([1, 1, 2])\n\npoint2 = np.array([10, 50, 50])\n\n# a plane is a*x+b*y+c*z+d=0\n# [a,b,c] is the normal. Thus, we have to calculate\n# d and we're set\nd = -point.dot(normal)\n\n# create x,y\nxx, yy = np.meshgrid(range(10), range(10))\n\n# calculate corresponding z\nz = (-normal[0] * xx - normal[1] * yy - d) * 1. /normal[2]\n\n# plot the surface\nplt3d = plt.figure().gca(projection='3d')\nplt3d.plot_surface(xx, yy, z, alpha=0.2)\n\n# and I would like to plot this point: \nax.scatter(point2[0] , point2[1] , point2[2],  color='green')\n\nplt.show()\n```"

        "content": "It looks like you have most of the code correct, but there is a small issue in your code. You need to ensure that you are using the same axis object (`plt3d`) to plot both the plane and the point. In your code, you're trying to use `ax.scatter` without defining `ax`. You should use `plt3d.scatter` instead.\n\nHere's the corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\n\n# Define a point and a normal vector\npoint = np.array([1, 2, 3])\nnormal = np.array([1, 1, 2])\n\n# Another point to plot\npoint2 = np.array([10, 50, 50])\n\n# Define the plane equation: a*x + b*y + c*z + d = 0\nd = -point.dot(normal)\n\n# Create a grid of x, y values\nxx, yy = np.meshgrid(range(10), range(10))\n\n# Calculate the corresponding z values for the plane\nz = (-normal[0] * xx - normal[1] * yy - d) * 1. / normal[2]\n\n# Create a 3D plot\nplt3d = plt.figure().gca(projection='3d')\n\n# Plot the plane (surface)\nplt3d.plot_surface(xx, yy, z, alpha=0.2)\n\n# Plot the point\nplt3d.scatter(point2[0], point2[1], point2[2], color='green')\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, I've replaced `ax.scatter` with `plt3d.scatter` to ensure that both the plane and the point are plotted on the same 3D axis. This should allow you to see both the plane and the point in the same plot."
