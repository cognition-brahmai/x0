        "content": "Certainly! It looks like there are a few potential issues that might be causing the 404 errors when trying to serve static files in your Django project. Let's go through some common troubleshooting steps:\n\n1. **Check `STATICFILES_DIRS`:**\n   Ensure that you've defined `STATICFILES_DIRS` in your `settings.py` to include the directory where your static files are located. It should look something like this:\n\n   ```python\n   STATICFILES_DIRS = [\n       os.path.join(BASE_DIR, \"static\"),\n   ]\n   ```\n\n   This tells Django where to look for static files during development.\n\n2. **Set `STATIC_ROOT` for Production:**\n   The `STATIC_ROOT` setting is used when you deploy your application and run the `collectstatic` command. If you're in development, you can leave it as an empty string, but ensure it's set when you move to production.\n\n3. **Check Directory Structure:**\n   Make sure your directory structure is correct and matches what you have defined in your `STATICFILES_DIRS`. The `static` directory should be at the same level as `manage.py`.\n\n4. **Development Server Configuration:**\n   If you're running the Django development server, make sure it's configured to serve static files. By default, `django-admin runserver` should do this if `DEBUG=True`. However, if you have set `DEBUG=False`, Django will not serve static files, and you'll need to configure a web server like Nginx or Apache to do so.\n\n5. **Check `urls.py`:**\n   Ensure your `urls.py` is correctly set up to serve static files in development:\n\n   ```python\n   from django.conf import settings\n   from django.conf.urls.static import static\n\n   urlpatterns = [\n       # ... your url patterns\n   ]\n\n   if settings.DEBUG:\n       urlpatterns += static(settings.STATIC_URL, document_root=settings.STATICFILES_DIRS[0])\n   ```\n\n6. **File Permissions:**\n   Check that the static files have the correct permissions to be read by the server.\n\n7. **Run `collectstatic`:**\n   If you're still having issues, try running `python manage.py collectstatic` to ensure all static files are collected properly (for production).\n\n8. **Correct Template Usage:**\n   Since you've used `{% load static %}` in your template, make sure it's placed at the top of your HTML file. Also, verify that the paths in your `{% static %}` tags are correct relative to your `static` directory.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the 404 errors related to static files in your Django project.
