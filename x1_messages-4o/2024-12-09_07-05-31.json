        "content": "It sounds like you're encountering an issue with the `urllib` module in Python 3.5.1. The `urllib` module in Python 3 has a different structure compared to Python 2, and sometimes issues can arise due to incorrect imports or path configurations. Here are a few steps to help you troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Correct Import Statement**:\n   Make sure you are using the correct import statement for Python 3.5.1. To use `urlopen`, you should import it from `urllib.request` like this:\n\n   ```python\n   from urllib import request\n\n   response = request.urlopen('http://example.com')\n   html = response.read()\n   ```\n\n2. **Check for File Conflicts**:\n   Ensure that there are no local files named `urllib.py` or `request.py` in your working directory, as these could shadow the standard library modules.\n\n3. **Verify Installation**:\n   It's possible that your Python installation might be corrupted. Try reinstalling Python 3.5.1 to ensure all standard libraries are correctly installed.\n\n4. **Check the Python Path**:\n   Verify that your Python path is correctly set up to point to the correct version of Python you intend to use. Run the following commands to check the version and path:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 --version\n   which python3\n   ```\n\n5. **Python Environment**:\n   If you're using a virtual environment, make sure it is activated before running your Python scripts. If not, consider setting one up to manage dependencies and versions more effectively.\n\n6. **Upgrade Python**:\n   Consider upgrading your Python version if possible, as Python 3.5 is an older version and might have some compatibility issues with newer libraries and modules. The latest Python 3 versions have more features and improvements.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with `urllib` and access the `urlopen` function properly. If the problem persists, please provide more details about any error messages you are receiving, and I'll be happy to help further!"
