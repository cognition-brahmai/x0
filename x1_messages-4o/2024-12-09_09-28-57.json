        "content": "Certainly! Calculating the average of an array of numbers in Python is straightforward. You can achieve this by summing the elements of the array and then dividing by the number of elements. Here's a simple Python function to do that:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    if not numbers:\n        return 0  # Return 0 if the list is empty to avoid division by zero\n    total_sum = sum(numbers)\n    count = len(numbers)\n    average = total_sum / count\n    return average\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\naverage = calculate_average(numbers)\nprint(\"The average is:\", average)\n```\n\nIn this function:\n- We first check if the list `numbers` is empty to avoid division by zero.\n- We use the `sum()` function to calculate the total sum of the array.\n- We use `len()` to find out how many numbers are in the list.\n- Finally, we calculate the average by dividing the total sum by the count of numbers.\n\nYou can replace the example `numbers` list with any array of numbers you want to calculate the average for."
