        "content": "To solve this problem, you'll need to modify the example code to include an actual age and a corresponding name for that age. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Define a list of people with their ages.\n2. Calculate the sum of two dice rolls plus 72.\n3. Check if any person's age matches this sum.\n4. Print the person's name if there's a match.\n\nHere's a complete Java program that demonstrates this:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\n\npublic class DiceAge {\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    // Define a map with people's names and their corresponding ages.\n    Map<String, Integer> people = new HashMap<>();\n    people.put(\"Alice\", 80);\n    people.put(\"Bob\", 81);\n    people.put(\"Charlie\", 82);\n    people.put(\"David\", 83);\n    people.put(\"Eve\", 84);\n    people.put(\"Frank\", 85);\n\n    // Iterate over all possible sums of two dice rolls (i and j).\n    for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {\n      for (int j = 1; j <= 6; j++) {\n        int age = i + j + 72;  // Calculate the age from the dice sum plus 72.\n\n        // Check if there's a person with the calculated age.\n        for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : people.entrySet()) {\n          if (entry.getValue() == age) {\n            System.out.println(\"The person's name is \" + entry.getKey() + \" with age \" + age + \".\");\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The program uses a `HashMap` to store people's names and their ages.\n- It iterates over all possible combinations of two dice rolls, calculating the sum plus 72.\n- It checks if any person's age matches this calculated age and prints the name if a match is found.\n\nYou can modify the `people` map with actual names and ages as needed."
