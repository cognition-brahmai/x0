For example, I have the URL \"http://www.digimouth.com/news/media/2011/09/google-logo.jpg\", which contains the Google logo. I want to achieve this without manually opening the URL in a browser and saving the file."

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:\n\n1. **Install the requests library**: If you haven't already installed the `requests` library, you can do so using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\n2. **Write the Python script**: Use the following script to download and save the image:\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n\n   # URL of the image\n   image_url = \"http://www.digimouth.com/news/media/2011/09/google-logo.jpg\"\n   \n   # Send a GET request to the image URL\n   response = requests.get(image_url)\n   \n   # Check if the request was successful\n   if response.status_code == 200:\n       # Open a local file with write-binary mode\n       with open(\"google-logo.jpg\", \"wb\") as file:\n           # Write the content of the response (image data) to the file\n           file.write(response.content)\n       print(\"Image successfully downloaded and saved.\")\n   else:\n       print(\"Failed to retrieve the image. Status code:\", response.status_code)\n   ```\n\n3. **Run the script**: Execute the script, and it will download the image from the specified URL and save it as \"google-logo.jpg\" in the current working directory.\n\nThis script uses the `requests` library to handle HTTP requests, and it checks if the response status code is 200, which indicates that the request was successful. The image data is then written to a file in binary mode to ensure the image is saved correctly."
