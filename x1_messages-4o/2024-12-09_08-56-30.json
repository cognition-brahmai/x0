        "content": "Creating a function in Python to generate a random password that includes both letters and numbers is a straightforward task. You can use the `random` module, which provides a suite of functions for generating random numbers and selecting random elements.\n\nHere's a simple example of how you might create such a function:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport string\n\ndef generate_random_password(length):\n    # Create a pool of characters: both letters and digits\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits\n    \n    # Use random.choices to select random characters from the pool\n    password = ''.join(random.choices(characters, k=length))\n    \n    return password\n\n# Example usage:\npassword_length = 10\nrandom_password = generate_random_password(password_length)\nprint(\"Generated Password:\", random_password)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Import Modules**:\n   - `random`: To generate random choices.\n   - `string`: To access predefined character sets (like `ascii_letters` and `digits`).\n\n2. **Character Pool**:\n   - `string.ascii_letters`: A combination of all lowercase and uppercase letters.\n   - `string.digits`: All digits from 0 to 9.\n   - The characters from these two sets are concatenated to create a pool of characters that the password can be generated from.\n\n3. **Generate Password**:\n   - `random.choices(characters, k=length)`: This function selects `length` number of characters from the pool, allowing for repetition.\n   - `''.join(...)`: Joins the list of characters into a single string.\n\n4. **Function Usage**:\n   - You can specify the desired password length and call the function to generate a random password.\n\nThis function will generate a password that is `length` characters long, containing a random mixture of letters and numbers. You can modify the character pool if you want to include additional symbols or change the character sets."
