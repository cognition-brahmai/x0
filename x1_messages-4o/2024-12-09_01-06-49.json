I've written the following code so far:\n\n```python\ndef common_elements(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a list containing the elements which are in both list1 and list2\n\n    >>> common_elements([1,2,3,4,5,6], [3,5,7,9])\n    [3, 5]\n    >>> common_elements(['this','this','n','that'],['this','not','that','that'])\n    ['this', 'that']\n    \"\"\"\n    for element in list1:\n        if element in list2:\n            return list(element)\n```\n\nHowever, I am unable to get it to work as expected. Can you help me figure out what I might be doing wrong?"

        "content": "Certainly! It looks like the issue in your code is that you're returning a list containing only the first common element found, rather than collecting all common elements. Additionally, you're using `return list(element)`, which is incorrect since `element` is not a list. Instead, you should be collecting all common elements in a new list and then returning that list at the end of the function. Here\u2019s how you can fix it:\n\n```python\ndef common_elements(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a list containing the elements which are in both list1 and list2\n\n    >>> common_elements([1,2,3,4,5,6], [3,5,7,9])\n    [3, 5]\n    >>> common_elements(['this','this','n','that'],['this','not','that','that'])\n    ['this', 'that']\n    \"\"\"\n    common = []\n    for element in list1:\n        if element in list2 and element not in common:\n            common.append(element)\n    return common\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- **List Initialization**: We initialize an empty list `common` to store common elements.\n- **Appending Elements**: We append each element to `common` if it's found in both lists and not already in `common` (to avoid duplicates).\n- **Returning the List**: Finally, we return the `common` list after iterating through all elements.\n\nThis should work as you expect, collecting all unique common elements between the two lists."
