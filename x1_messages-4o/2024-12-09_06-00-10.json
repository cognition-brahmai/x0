I tried the following code:\n\n```python\nroot = tk.Tk()\nimg = ImageTk.PhotoImage(Image.open(path))\npanel = tk.Label(root, image = img)\npanel.pack(side = \"bottom\", fill = \"both\", expand = \"yes\")\nroot.mainloop()\n```\nBut it's giving me a syntax error. What could be the possible reason and how can I correct this?"

        "content": "If you're encountering a syntax error with the code you provided, it's likely due to a missing import statement or incorrect code structure. Here are some steps to ensure your code is correct:\n\n1. **Check Imports**: Ensure you have imported the necessary modules correctly. You should have the following import statements:\n\n    ```python\n    import tkinter as tk\n    from PIL import Image, ImageTk\n    ```\n\n2. **Check Image Path**: Ensure the `path` variable contains a valid string representing the path to the image you want to load.\n\n3. **Scope of `img`**: Make sure that the `img` variable is not garbage-collected. You can prevent this by keeping a reference to the `img` object (e.g., by attaching it to the `panel` or `root` object).\n\nHere is the corrected version of your code with added imports and a reference to the image:\n\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\nfrom PIL import Image, ImageTk\n\nroot = tk.Tk()\n\n# Ensure you have a valid path here\npath = \"path/to/your/image.jpg\"\nimg = ImageTk.PhotoImage(Image.open(path))\n\npanel = tk.Label(root, image=img)\npanel.image = img  # Keep a reference to avoid garbage collection\npanel.pack(side=\"bottom\", fill=\"both\", expand=\"yes\")\n\nroot.mainloop()\n```\n\nMake sure you replace `\"path/to/your/image.jpg\"` with the actual file path of your image. This code should work without syntax errors if the path is correct and the necessary libraries are installed (`Pillow` for `Image` and `ImageTk`). If not installed, you can install Pillow via pip:\n\n```bash\npip install pillow\n```\n\nFinally, if the error persists, double-check for any syntax errors or typos in your code beyond what you've shared."
