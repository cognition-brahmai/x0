        "content": "Certainly! You can create a function in JavaScript to remove consecutive duplicates from a given string by iterating through the string and checking each character against the previous one. Here's a simple function to achieve that:\n\n```javascript\nfunction removeConsecutiveDuplicates(input) {\n  // Initialize an empty result string\n  let result = '';\n\n  // Iterate through the input string\n  for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {\n    // Add the character to the result if it's the first character\n    // or if it's different from the previous character\n    if (i === 0 || input[i] !== input[i - 1]) {\n      result += input[i];\n    }\n  }\n\n  return result;\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst inputString = \"aabbccddeeff\";\nconst resultString = removeConsecutiveDuplicates(inputString);\nconsole.log(resultString); // Output: \"abcdef\"\n```\n\nThis function works by comparing each character in the string with the one before it. If the current character is different from the previous one, it gets added to the result string. If it's the same, it's skipped, effectively removing consecutive duplicates."
