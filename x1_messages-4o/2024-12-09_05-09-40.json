        "content": "When you use Python's `help()` function, it typically opens a pager in the terminal, similar to the `less` command, which allows you to navigate through the documentation. On macOS, you can use the following keyboard shortcuts to navigate and exit the help screen:\n\n1. **Page Down**: Press the `Spacebar` to move down one page at a time.\n\n2. **Page Up**: Press the `b` key to move up one page at a time.\n\n3. **Move to the End**: Press `G` to jump to the end of the document.\n\n4. **Move to the Beginning**: Press `g` to jump to the start of the document.\n\n5. **Line Down**: Press the `Enter` key or `j` to move down one line.\n\n6. **Line Up**: Press `k` to move up one line.\n\n7. **Search**: Press `/` to start a search, then type your search term and press `Enter`. Use `n` to go to the next occurrence and `N` to go to the previous occurrence.\n\n8. **Exit**: Press `q` to quit the help screen and return to the Python prompt.\n\nThese navigation keys are similar to those used in `less`, a terminal-based text viewer, which is why they are quite intuitive for users familiar with terminal navigation. If you're still in the help screen and can't exit, try pressing `q` again to ensure it's registered. If nothing seems to work, you might need to check your terminal settings or Python environment setup."
