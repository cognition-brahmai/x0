You can use the underscore `_` as a convention to indicate that you are intentionally ignoring a value. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nx, _ = func()\n```\n\nBy using the underscore `_`, you're signaling to anyone reading your code (and to yourself) that the second value is intentionally being ignored. This is a common Python idiom, and it keeps your code clean and easy to understand."
