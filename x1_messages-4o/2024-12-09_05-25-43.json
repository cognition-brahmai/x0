However, I am experiencing a problem where the same ID is being produced every time I try to reproduce the ID for the UUID model. Below is my current implementation:\n\n```\nimport uuid\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass MyUUIDModel(models.Model):\n    id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False)\n\nclass Person(models.Model):\n    ...\n    unique_id = MyUUIDModel()\n```\n\nAnd this is how I am reproducing the ID:\n\n```\nperson = Person.objects.get(some_field = some_thing)\nid = person.unique_id.id\n```\n\nCan someone help me understand why I am getting the same ID every time and how can I fix this?"

        "content": "It looks like there might be some confusion in your implementation regarding how you're using the `UUIDField` in Django. Let's address a few points to help resolve the issue:\n\n### Issues in the Current Implementation\n\n1. **Model Definition**:\n   - The `MyUUIDModel` is defined as a separate model, which is not necessary if you only want to use it as a field within the `Person` model.\n   - Each `Person` instance should have its own UUID directly, rather than linking to a separate `MyUUIDModel`.\n\n2. **Field Assignment**:\n   - You seem to be using the `MyUUIDModel` class as a field, which is incorrect. Fields should be defined using `models.UUIDField` directly inside the `Person` model.\n\n### Correct Implementation\n\nHere\u2019s a revised version of your models:\n\n```python\nimport uuid\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass Person(models.Model):\n    # Other fields...\n    unique_id = models.UUIDField(default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False, unique=True)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **UUIDField**: Directly include `UUIDField` in the `Person` model. This means each `Person` instance will automatically generate a unique UUID when created.\n- **Unique Constraint**: Adding `unique=True` ensures that the UUID is unique across all `Person` instances.\n- **Default Value**: By setting `default=uuid.uuid4`, a new UUID is generated for every new `Person` instance.\n\n### Usage Example\n\nWhen you create a new `Person` instance, a unique UUID will be automatically assigned:\n\n```python\nperson = Person.objects.create(some_field=some_value)\nprint(person.unique_id)  # This should now give you a unique UUID each time.\n```\n\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n- Ensure that you're not inadvertently creating multiple `Person` instances with the same UUID by manually setting the `unique_id` field.\n- Double-check any data migrations or manual data manipulations that might be affecting the UUID assignment.\n\nThis setup should ensure that each `Person` instance has a unique ID, and you won't encounter the problem of duplicate UUIDs."
