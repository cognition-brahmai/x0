I am able to generate a list of random numbers using the code `r = [ran.random() for i in range(1,100)]`. However, I am unsure how to modify this so that the sum of the list is 1. This is required for a probability simulation."

        "content": "To generate a list of 100 random numbers that sum up to 1, you can normalize the list of random numbers you generate. Here's a step-by-step way to achieve this in Python:\n\n1. Generate a list of random numbers.\n2. Calculate the sum of the list.\n3. Divide each element by the sum to normalize them so that the total is 1.\n\nHere's the code to do this:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# Step 1: Generate a list of random numbers\nrandom_numbers = [random.random() for _ in range(100)]\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the sum of the list\ntotal_sum = sum(random_numbers)\n\n# Step 3: Normalize the list so that the sum is 1\nnormalized_numbers = [x / total_sum for x in random_numbers]\n\n# Verify the sum is 1\nprint(f\"Sum of normalized numbers: {sum(normalized_numbers)}\")\nprint(normalized_numbers)\n```\n\nThis code will give you 100 random numbers whose sum is 1, making them suitable for use in a probability simulation. Each number in the list is a fraction of the original total sum, ensuring the list's sum is exactly 1."
