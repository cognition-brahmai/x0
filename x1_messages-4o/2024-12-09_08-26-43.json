Here's the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# read the entire file into a python array\nwith open('C:/Users/Alberto/nutrients.json', 'rb') as f:\n   data = f.readlines()\n\n# remove the trailing \"\\n\" from each line\ndata = map(lambda x: x.rstrip(), data)\n\n# each element of 'data' is an individual JSON object.\n# I want to convert it into an *array* of JSON objects\n# which, in and of itself, is one large JSON object\n# basically... add square brackets to the beginning\n# and end, and have all the individual business JSON objects\n# separated by a comma\ndata_json_str = \"[\" + \",\".join(data) + \"]\"\n\n# now, load it into pandas\ndata_df = pd.read_json(data_json_str)\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to attempting to join bytes directly into a string, which is not allowed in Python. When reading the file in binary mode (`'rb'`), each line is read as a bytes object. To fix this, you should decode the bytes to strings before joining them. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve that:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read the entire file into a Python list of strings\nwith open('C:/Users/Alberto/nutrients.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n    data = f.readlines()\n\n# Remove the trailing \"\\n\" from each line\ndata = map(lambda x: x.rstrip('\\n'), data)\n\n# Each element of 'data' is an individual JSON object.\n# Convert it into a single JSON array string by adding\n# square brackets and separating objects with a comma.\ndata_json_str = \"[\" + \",\".join(data) + \"]\"\n\n# Load it into pandas\ndata_df = pd.read_json(data_json_str)\n\n# Display the DataFrame\nprint(data_df)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Open the File in Text Mode**: Open the file with `'r'` mode and specify the `encoding='utf-8'` to handle text properly. This way, you don't deal with bytes but directly with strings.\n\n2. **Remove Newline Characters**: Use `rstrip('\\n')` to remove the newline characters from each line.\n\nThis should help you read the JSON file into a pandas DataFrame without encountering the `TypeError`. Additionally, consider using `pd.read_json()` with the `lines=True` parameter if your JSON file is in a line-delimited format, which can be more efficient:\n\n```python\ndata_df = pd.read_json('C:/Users/Alberto/nutrients.json', lines=True)\n```\n\nThis approach directly reads each line as a separate JSON object, assuming the file format supports it."
