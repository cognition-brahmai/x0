The function 'foo' is defined as follows:\n\n```python\ndef foo(some args):\n   a = someObject\n   b = someObject\n   return a,b\n```\n\nI run the multiprocessing as:\n\n```python\np1=multiprocess(target=foo,args(some args))\np2=multiprocess(target=foo,args(some args))\np3=multiprocess(target=foo,args(some args))\n```\n\nI am aware of the use of .start and .join, but I am unable to retrieve the individual results. How can I catch the return values 'a' and 'b' for all the jobs I execute and then work on it?"

        "content": "In Python, the `multiprocessing` module provides a way to run functions in parallel and retrieve their return values using `multiprocessing.Pool` or by using `multiprocessing.Process` along with a `multiprocessing.Queue` or `multiprocessing.Pipe`. Here's how you can achieve this using both methods:\n\n### Using `multiprocessing.Pool`\n\nThe `multiprocessing.Pool` is a high-level interface that makes it easy to parallelize the execution of a function across multiple input values. Here's how you can use it to get return values:\n\n```python\nfrom multiprocessing import Pool\n\ndef foo(args):\n    a = someObject\n    b = someObject\n    return a, b\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    args_list = [(arg1, arg2), (arg3, arg4), (arg5, arg6)]  # List of tuples with arguments for each call to foo\n    with Pool(processes=3) as pool:\n        results = pool.map(foo, args_list)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        a, b = result\n        # Process a and b\n\n```\n\n### Using `multiprocessing.Process` and `multiprocessing.Queue`\n\nIf you prefer to use `multiprocessing.Process`, you can use a `Queue` to collect the return values:\n\n```python\nfrom multiprocessing import Process, Queue\n\ndef foo(args, q):\n    a = someObject\n    b = someObject\n    q.put((a, b))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    q = Queue()\n    \n    args_list = [(arg1, arg2), (arg3, arg4), (arg5, arg6)]  # List of tuples with arguments for each call to foo\n    processes = []\n    \n    for args in args_list:\n        p = Process(target=foo, args=(args, q))\n        processes.append(p)\n        p.start()\n    \n    for p in processes:\n        p.join()\n    \n    results = [q.get() for _ in processes]\n    \n    for result in results:\n        a, b = result\n        # Process a and b\n\n```\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Using `Pool`:** Automatically handles the distribution of input arguments and collection of results, making it more convenient for many cases.\n- **Using `Process` and `Queue`:** Provides more flexibility and control over process creation and inter-process communication, but requires more code to manage.\n\nChoose the method that best fits your needs. If your tasks can be easily divided and collected, `Pool` is generally simpler and preferred. If you need more control over the process life cycle, use `Process` and `Queue`."
