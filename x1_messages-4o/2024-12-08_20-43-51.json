Can you calculate the total cost of the item after applying the sales tax? Remember to round to the nearest cent! To make it more challenging, can you write a program in Java that takes in the item cost and sales tax rate as input and outputs the total cost with the sales tax included? Good luck!"

        "content": "Sure, let's start with the calculation first.\n\nTo find the total cost of the item after applying the sales tax, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the sales tax amount by multiplying the item cost by the sales tax rate.\n2. Add the sales tax amount to the original item cost to get the total cost.\n\nHere's the calculation:\n\n1. Sales Tax Amount = \\( \\$5.55 \\times 0.075 = \\$0.41625 \\)\n\n2. Total Cost = \\( \\$5.55 + \\$0.41625 = \\$5.96625 \\)\n\nRounded to the nearest cent, the total cost is \\( \\$5.97 \\).\n\nNow, let's write a Java program to perform this calculation:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class SalesTaxCalculator {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        // Prompt user for the item cost and sales tax rate\n        System.out.print(\"Enter the item cost: \");\n        double itemCost = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        System.out.print(\"Enter the sales tax rate (as a percentage): \");\n        double salesTaxRate = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        // Convert sales tax rate from percentage to decimal\n        double salesTaxDecimal = salesTaxRate / 100.0;\n\n        // Calculate the sales tax amount\n        double salesTaxAmount = itemCost * salesTaxDecimal;\n\n        // Calculate the total cost\n        double totalCost = itemCost + salesTaxAmount;\n\n        // Round the total cost to the nearest cent\n        totalCost = Math.round(totalCost * 100.0) / 100.0;\n\n        // Output the total cost\n        System.out.println(\"The total cost after applying the sales tax is: $\" + totalCost);\n\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis program will prompt the user to input the item cost and the sales tax rate, and then it will calculate and display the total cost after applying the sales tax, rounded to the nearest cent."
