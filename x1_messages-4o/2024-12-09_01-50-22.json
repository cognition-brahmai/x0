        "content": "Is the sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error metric in Scikit-Learn designed to be larger the better (negated), as opposed to the general understanding that a smaller mean_squared_error is better? The sklearn metrics package documentation states that higher return values are better than lower return values. However, the sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error documentation describes it as the 'Mean squared error regression loss' without mentioning that it's negated. Looking at the source code and examples, it seems to be doing the normal mean squared error calculation, i.e., the smaller the better. Is there a negated aspect that I'm missing?"

        "content": "The confusion seems to stem from a misinterpretation of the documentation regarding how scoring functions are generally viewed in certain contexts within Scikit-Learn. The `sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error` function is indeed implemented in the conventional way: it calculates the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted and true values, where a smaller MSE indicates better model performance.\n\nThe statement you are referring to about \"higher return values are better than lower return values\" typically applies to the scoring functions used in cross-validation or hyperparameter tuning, where Scikit-Learn might internally use a negative version of the MSE (i.e., negative mean squared error) to maintain consistency with the convention that higher scores are better. This is why sometimes you might see `neg_mean_squared_error` as a scoring parameter in those contexts.\n\nIn summary, when you directly use `sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error`, it behaves as expected: the smaller the value, the better the model performance. The negation you might be referring to is used internally for scoring purposes in specific functions like `cross_val_score`, where scores are typically maximized. In those cases, the negative of the mean squared error is used so that the optimization process can remain consistent with the maximization framework."
