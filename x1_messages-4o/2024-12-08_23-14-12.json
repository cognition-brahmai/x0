They are rich in protein and also provide essential nutrients such as fiber, iron, and folate.\n\n2. **Tofu and Tempeh**: Made from soybeans, both tofu and tempeh are excellent sources of protein. Tofu is versatile and can be used in a variety of dishes, while tempeh has a firmer texture and a nutty flavor."
