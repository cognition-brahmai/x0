I know how to calculate the column wise mean and the column wise range (max(col) - min(col)) of a dataframe, but I am not sure how to perform this specific normalization. Here is what I've done so far: \n\nTo calculate the column wise mean:\n```python\ndf.apply(average)\n```\nTo calculate the column wise range:\n```python\ndf.apply(max) - df.apply(min)\n```\nNow, how can I subtract each element's column mean and divide by its column's range?"

        "content": "To normalize the data in your pandas DataFrame by subtracting each element's column mean and dividing by its column's range, you can apply a custom function to each column. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Your DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n    'B': [5, 6, 7, 8, 9],\n    'C': [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]\n})\n\n# Function to normalize a column\ndef normalize_column(column):\n    column_mean = column.mean()\n    column_range = column.max() - column.min()\n    # Avoid division by zero if column range is zero\n    if column_range == 0:\n        return column - column_mean\n    else:\n        return (column - column_mean) / column_range\n\n# Apply the normalization function to each column\nnormalized_df = df.apply(normalize_column)\n\nprint(normalized_df)\n```\n\nThis code will return a new DataFrame `normalized_df` where each element has been normalized by subtracting the column mean and dividing by the column range. Note the check for division by zero to handle columns where all values might be the same, resulting in a range of zero."
