        "content": "I am trying to plot a part of an array using Matplotlib in Python where the x-axis is fixed and the y-axis is set to autoscale. I have attempted to do this with the following code, but it is not working as expected. Here's the code I am using:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndata=[np.arange(0,101,1),300-0.1*np.arange(0,101,1)]\n\nplt.figure()\n\nplt.scatter(data[0], data[1])\nplt.xlim([50,100])\nplt.autoscale(enable=True, axis='y')\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThe resulting plot does not autoscale the y-axis as I had hoped it would. Any suggestions on how to solve this?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to the order of operations in Matplotlib. When you set the limits for the x-axis using `plt.xlim()`, it does not automatically trigger a recalculation of the y-axis limits unless explicitly told to do so. Therefore, the `plt.autoscale()` function needs to be called after the plot has been adjusted.\n\nHere's a modified version of your code that should work as expected:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndata = [np.arange(0, 101, 1), 300 - 0.1 * np.arange(0, 101, 1)]\n\nplt.figure()\n\nplt.scatter(data[0], data[1])\n\n# Set the x-axis limits first\nplt.xlim([50, 100])\n\n# Adjust the y-axis limits based on the visible data\nplt.gca().set_ylim(auto=True)\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this code, after setting the x-axis limits with `plt.xlim()`, we use `plt.gca().set_ylim(auto=True)` to automatically adjust the y-axis limits based on the data currently visible within the x-axis range. This should result in the y-axis being autoscaled to fit the visible portion of the data."
