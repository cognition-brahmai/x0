        "content": "In Python, `self` is a conventionally used parameter name that refers to the instance of the class. It is used in the context of defining instance methods within a class. Here's when and why you use `self`:\n\n1. **Inside Class Methods**: \n   - When defining instance methods in a class, the first parameter is typically `self`. This parameter allows you to access instance variables and other methods from within the class.\n   - Example:\n     ```python\n     class MyClass:\n         def __init__(self, value):\n             self.value = value  # 'self' is used to initialize instance variables\n\n         def display_value(self):\n             print(self.value)  # 'self' is used to access an instance variable\n     ```\n\n2. **Referencing Instance Variables**:\n   - To access or modify instance variables within class methods, you use `self.variable_name`.\n   - Example:\n     ```python\n     def set_value(self, new_value):\n         self.value = new_value  # 'self' is used to modify an instance variable\n     ```\n\n3. **Calling Other Methods**:\n   - When you call another method from within a class, you use `self.method_name()`.\n   - Example:\n     ```python\n     def call_display(self):\n         self.display_value()  # 'self' is used to call another method within the class\n     ```\n\n4. **Necessity of `self`**:\n   - `self` is necessary for instance methods to access instance-specific data and to differentiate them from class methods and variables.\n   - It is not used for class methods, which are defined with the `@classmethod` decorator and typically take `cls` as their first parameter, or static methods, which use the `@staticmethod` decorator.\n\n5. **Use in the Same Module**:\n   - `self` is not related to module-level references; it specifically pertains to class instances. Whether methods or variables are in the same module or a different one does not affect the use of `self`.\n\nIn summary, `self` is a fundamental aspect of instance methods in Python classes, used to access and modify instance variables and methods. It is not used for module-level functions or variables."
