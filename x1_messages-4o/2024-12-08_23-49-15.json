        "content": "To determine the value of a specific variable in a system of equations, you can use various methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations (like Gaussian elimination). Here, we'll use the elimination method to solve for \\( x \\) in the given system of equations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Algorithm\n\n1. **Identify Equations:**\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   (1) & \\quad 3x + 4y - 2z = 12 \\\\\n   (2) & \\quad 2x - 6y + 3z = -7 \\\\\n   (3) & \\quad 5x + 7y - 2z = 21\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Eliminate One Variable:**\n   - We will first eliminate \\( z \\) from equations (1) and (3) by aligning the coefficients of \\( z \\) and adding/subtracting the equations.\n\n   Multiply equation (1) by 1 and equation (3) by 1:\n\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   (1) & \\quad 3x + 4y - 2z = 12 \\\\\n   (3) & \\quad 5x + 7y - 2z = 21\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n   Subtract equation (1) from equation (3):\n\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   (3) - (1): & \\quad (5x + 7y - 2z) - (3x + 4y - 2z) = 21 - 12 \\\\\n   & \\quad 2x + 3y = 9 \\quad \\text{(Equation 4)}\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Eliminate the Same Variable from Another Pair:**\n   - Now, eliminate \\( z \\) from equations (1) and (2).\n\n   Multiply equation (1) by 3 and equation (2) by 2:\n\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   3 \\times (1) & \\quad 9x + 12y - 6z = 36 \\\\\n   2 \\times (2) & \\quad 4x - 12y + 6z = -14\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n   Add these modified equations:\n\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   (9x + 12y - 6z) + (4x - 12y + 6z) = 36 + (-14) \\\\\n   13x = 22 \\\\\n   x = \\frac{22}{13}\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verify the Solution:**\n\n   Substitute \\( x = \\frac{22}{13} \\) back into equations (2) or (4) to solve for other variables if needed.\n\nThus, the value of \\( x \\) is \\( \\frac{22}{13} \\)."
