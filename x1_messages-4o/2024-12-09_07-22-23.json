Here are the steps you can follow:\n\n1. **Find the Bash executable path**:\n   First, make sure Bash is installed on your system and find its path. It's usually located at `/bin/bash`. You can verify this by running:\n   ```bash\n   which bash\n   ```\n\n2. **Change the default shell**:\n   Use the `chsh` command to change your default shell to Bash. Run the following command:\n   ```bash\n   chsh -s /bin/bash\n   ```\n\n   You might be prompted to enter your password. Provide your user password to proceed.\n\n3. **Log out and log back in**:\n   For the changes to take effect, you need to log out of your current session and log back in. Alternatively, you can restart your system.\n\n4. **Verify the change**:\n   After logging back in, you can verify that your default shell has been changed to Bash by running:\n   ```bash\n   echo $SHELL\n   ```\n   This should now output `/bin/bash`.\n\nIf you're changing the shell for another user, you would use:\n```bash\nsudo chsh -s /bin/bash username\n```\nReplace `username` with the actual username of the user for whom you want to change the shell."
