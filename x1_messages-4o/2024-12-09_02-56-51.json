I would like to note that I don't want to use XPath, as the ID changes every time the webpage is relaunched. Here is my current code: \n```python\ntext = driver.find_element_by_class_name(\"current-stage\").getText(\"my text\")\n```\nThe HTML of the webpage is as follows: \n```html\n<span class=\"current-text\" id=\"yui_3_7_0_4_1389185744113_384\">my text</span>\n```\nCan you help me figure out how to correct this?"

        "content": "Certainly! The issue you're encountering is likely due to the use of the incorrect method to extract text from a web element. In Selenium, you should use the `.text` attribute to get the text content of a web element, not the `.getText()` method.\n\nAdditionally, you mentioned that you are trying to find elements by class name, but there seems to be a discrepancy between the class name in your code (\"current-stage\") and the class name in the HTML (\"current-text\"). Ensure that you are using the correct class name.\n\nHere's how you can correct your code:\n\n```python\n# Corrected code\ntext = driver.find_element_by_class_name(\"current-text\").text\nprint(text)\n```\n\nMake sure that:\n1. You use the correct class name from your HTML (`\"current-text\"` in this case).\n2. You access the `.text` attribute of the element to retrieve its text content.\n\nIf the class name or other attributes change dynamically, you might want to consider using other strategies such as:\n- Using a more stable CSS selector if any other attributes are consistent.\n- Using JavaScript to directly retrieve the text if necessary.\n\nLet me know if you need further assistance with this!"
