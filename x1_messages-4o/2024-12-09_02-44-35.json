When both buttons are clicked, the \"remove\" button is causing a \"Bad Request\" error, stating that the browser (or proxy) sent a request that the server could not understand. Here is my layout code:\n\n```html\n<form action=\"{{ url_for('index') }}\" method=\"post\">\n    <input type=\"submit\" name=\"add\" value=\"Like\">\n    <input type=\"submit\" name=\"remove\" value=\"Dislike\">\n</form>\n```\n\nAnd here is my main.py code:\n\n```python\n...\nif request.method == 'POST':\n    if request.form['add']:\n        return redirect(url_for('index'))\n    elif request.form['remove']:\n        return redirect(url_for('index'))\n...\n```\n\nThe \"add\" button is working fine but the \"remove\" button is causing the error. How can I fix this?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely due to the way you're checking for the presence of the form data. When you use `request.form['add']` or `request.form['remove']`, it assumes that the key is always present in the form data. If the key is not present, it raises a `KeyError`, which can lead to a \"Bad Request\" error if not handled properly.\n\nTo fix this, you should use the `get` method to safely access the form data. This method returns `None` if the key is not present, instead of raising an error. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nif request.method == 'POST':\n    if request.form.get('add'):\n        # Handle the 'Like' button click\n        return redirect(url_for('index'))\n    elif request.form.get('remove'):\n        # Handle the 'Dislike' button click\n        return redirect(url_for('index'))\n```\n\nBy using `request.form.get('add')` and `request.form.get('remove')`, you ensure that your code checks for the presence of the data without causing an error if the key is not present. This should resolve the \"Bad Request\" error you're experiencing with the \"remove\" button."
