Are there any good GitHub links with well structured code for reference? Should every class like data cleaning have `fit()`, `transform()`, `fit_transform()` function for every process like `remove_missing()`, `outlier_removal()`?

        "content": "Structuring machine learning projects using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python can help in organizing code, making it reusable, and maintaining a clean architecture. Here's a guide on how you can structure your ML projects using OOP principles, along with some recommendations and best practices:\n\n### General Structure\n\n1. **Data Handling Classes**:\n   - **Data Cleaning Class**: Create classes for data cleaning tasks. For instance, a `DataCleaner` class can have methods like `remove_missing()`, `outlier_removal()`, etc. Implement `fit()`, `transform()`, and `fit_transform()` methods where applicable, similar to scikit-learn transformers.\n   - **Feature Engineering Class**: This class can handle feature transformations and engineering tasks. Again, use `fit()`, `transform()`, `fit_transform()` for consistency with scikit-learn pipelines.\n\n2. **Modeling Classes**:\n   - **ModelWrapper Class**: Encapsulate your model training and prediction logic in a class. This can include methods for training, prediction, and evaluation.\n   - **Hyperparameter Tuning Class**: Create a class for grid search and hyperparameter optimization. This class can interact with your model class to find the best hyperparameters.\n\n3. **Pipeline Class**:\n   - Create a pipeline class to manage the flow of data through various stages, from data cleaning to modeling. You can use scikit-learn's `Pipeline` or create a custom one.\n\n4. **Configuration**:\n   - Use a configuration file (e.g., YAML or JSON) to manage settings like file paths, hyperparameters, and other constants. This approach makes it easy to change settings without altering the code.\n\n### Why Inherit from `BaseEstimator`?\n\nInheriting from `BaseEstimator` and `TransformerMixin` in scikit-learn allows your classes to integrate seamlessly with scikit-learn's pipeline and grid search functionalities. It provides a standard interface for your custom classes to work like built-in scikit-learn components.\n\n### Code Design Practices\n\n- **Modularity**: Break down tasks into small, manageable classes or functions.\n- **Reusability**: Write code that can be reused across different projects.\n- **Encapsulation**: Keep class internals hidden and provide public methods for interaction.\n- **Documentation**: Write clear docstrings for classes and methods for better understanding.\n\n### Example GitHub Repositories\n\nHere are some well-structured machine learning projects that use OOP principles:\n\n1. [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science): A project template for data science and ML projects.\n2. [Scikit-Learn Pipelines](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/tree/master/03_classification): Example of using scikit-learn's pipelines in a structured way.\n\n### Config File Structure\n\nA typical config file may include:\n\n```yaml\ndata:\n  path: \"data/train.csv\"\n  test_path: \"data/test.csv\"\n\nmodel:\n  type: \"random_forest\"\n  hyperparameters:\n    n_estimators: 100\n    max_depth: 10\n\nfeature_engineering:\n  remove_outliers: true\n  scaling: \"standard\"\n\ntraining:\n  validation_split: 0.2\n  random_seed: 42\n```\n\nThis structure allows you to easily modify and manage project configurations without changing the underlying codebase.\n\nStructuring your ML projects with OOP and these practices can significantly improve maintainability, readability, and scalability as your projects grow."
