I have tried to implement this using an if statement within a for loop but I'm encountering a SyntaxError: invalid syntax at the line 'if i contains 'email':'. How can I resolve this and correctly implement the conditional statement?\n\nHere is the code I have tried:\n\n```python\nfor i in df2['Activity']:\n    if i contains 'email':\n        df2['Activity_2'] = 'email'\n    elif i contains 'conference':\n        df2['Activity_2'] = 'conference'\n    elif i contains 'call':\n        df2['Activity_2'] = 'call'\n    else:\n        df2['Activity_2'] = 'task'\n```\n\nAnd here is the error message: \n\n```python\nError: if i contains 'email':\n            ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the incorrect syntax of the condition in the `if` statement. In Python, you cannot use the keyword `contains` to check for a substring within a string. Instead, you should use the `in` keyword. Additionally, the way you're updating the `Activity_2` column will overwrite all rows with the same value, which is not what you want. You need to assign values to the column on a row-by-row basis.\n\nHere is the corrected version of your code using the `apply` method, which is more efficient for this kind of operation:\n\n```python\ndef categorize_activity(activity):\n    if 'email' in activity:\n        return 'email'\n    elif 'conference' in activity:\n        return 'conference'\n    elif 'call' in activity:\n        return 'call'\n    else:\n        return 'task'\n\ndf2['Activity_2'] = df2['Activity'].apply(categorize_activity)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- We define a function `categorize_activity` that takes a string `activity` and returns a category based on its content.\n- We then use the `apply` method to apply this function to each element in the `Activity` column, storing the result in the new column `Activity_2`. This ensures that each row is processed individually and updated correctly."
