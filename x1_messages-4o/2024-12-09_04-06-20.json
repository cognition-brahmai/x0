        "content": "Yes, you can insert images into an Excel file using the `openpyxl` library. The library supports adding images in formats like JPEG and PNG to Excel worksheets. Here's a basic example of how you can do this:\n\nFirst, make sure you have the `openpyxl` library installed. If not, you can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install openpyxl\n```\n\nThen, you can use the following code to insert an image into an Excel worksheet:\n\n```python\nfrom openpyxl import Workbook\nfrom openpyxl.drawing.image import Image\n\n# Create a workbook and select the active worksheet\nwb = Workbook()\nws = wb.active\n\n# Load the image\nimg = Image('path_to_your_image.png')  # Replace with the path to your image file\n\n# Add the image to the worksheet at a specific cell\nws.add_image(img, 'A1')  # Adjust the cell position as needed\n\n# Save the workbook\nwb.save('your_excel_file.xlsx')  # Replace with your desired file name\n```\n\nThis code will place the image at the specified cell location ('A1' in this example) in your Excel worksheet. You can adjust the cell position to place the image where you want it. Also, make sure to specify the correct path to your image file.\n\nIf you want to add a chart below the image, you can continue to build your Excel sheet and use `openpyxl`'s chart functionality to insert charts as needed."
