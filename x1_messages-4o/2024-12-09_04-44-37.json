The `is` operator checks for object identity, meaning it evaluates to `True` if both variables point to the same object in memory. Here is how you can use it in your scenario:\n\n```python\nx = ['a', 'b', 'c']\ny = x                 # x and y reference the same object\nz = ['a', 'b', 'c']   # x and z reference different objects\n\n# Check if x and y reference the same object\nprint(x is y)  # Output: True\n\n# Check if x and z reference the same object\nprint(x is z)  # Output: False\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `x is y` returns `True` because `y` is assigned to `x`, meaning they both reference the same list object.\n- `x is z` returns `False` because `z` is a new list object with the same content as `x`, but it is a different object in memory."
