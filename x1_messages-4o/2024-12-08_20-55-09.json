It can also be used as an expletive at the beginning of a sentence to introduce a clause.\n  - Example: \"The book is over there on the table.\"\n\n- **Their**: This is a possessive adjective, used to indicate that something belongs to a group of people.\n  - Example: \"Their car is parked outside.\"\n\n### Table of Commonly Confused Words\n\n| Word Pair       | Meaning of First Word                              | Meaning of Second Word                             |\n|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| There vs Their  | Indicates a place/position or used as an expletive | Possessive form of 'they'                          |\n| Affect vs Effect| To influence something                             | A result or an outcome                             |\n| Accept vs Except| To receive willingly                               | To exclude                                        |\n| Complement vs Compliment | Something that completes or goes well with | A polite expression of praise or admiration       |\n| Principle vs Principal | A fundamental truth or proposition          | The head of a school, or most important            |\n\n### Code Snippet Demonstrating Correct Usage\n\n```python\ndef locate_station(reference):\n    if reference == \"there\":\n        return \"The station is on the other side of town.\"\n    elif reference == \"their\":\n        return \"Their station is on the other side of town.\"\n    else:\n        return \"Reference not understood.\"\n\n# Testing the function with different references\nprint(locate_station(\"there\"))  # Intended to indicate location\nprint(locate_station(\"their\"))  # Intended to indicate possession\n```\n\n### Explanation of Code Output\n- `locate_station(\"there\")` returns \"The station is on the other side of town.\" This output uses \"there\" to indicate the location of the station.\n- `locate_station(\"their\")` returns \"Their station is on the other side of town.\" This output uses \"their\" to show possession, suggesting that the station belongs to a group of people.\n\nBy using the correct word in the context, the meaning of the sentence becomes clear and prevents misunderstanding."
