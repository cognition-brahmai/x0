        "content": "In Python, there's no built-in feature exactly like a copy constructor as found in some other languages like C++. However, you can achieve similar functionality using a combination of existing Python features.\n\nHere\u2019s an approach you can take to convert objects from a library class into instances of your extended class:\n\n1. **Define an `__init__` method**: In your extended class, define an `__init__` method that can take an instance of the library class and copy its attributes.\n\n2. **Use the `copy` module**: If the library class supports or implements the `copy` protocol, you could use the `copy` module to create shallow or deep copies of the object.\n\n3. **Manually copy attributes**: Create a method in your extended class that accepts an instance of the library class and manually copies the relevant attributes.\n\nHere's an example illustrating these steps:\n\n```python\nclass LibraryClass:\n    def __init__(self, attr1, attr2):\n        self.attr1 = attr1\n        self.attr2 = attr2\n\nclass ExtendedClass(LibraryClass):\n    def __init__(self, library_instance=None, extra_attr=None):\n        if library_instance:\n            # Copy attributes from the library instance\n            self.attr1 = library_instance.attr1\n            self.attr2 = library_instance.attr2\n        else:\n            # Initialize with default values or raise an error if needed\n            self.attr1 = None\n            self.attr2 = None\n        # Initialize any additional attributes\n        self.extra_attr = extra_attr\n\n    def copy_from_library_instance(self, library_instance):\n        self.attr1 = library_instance.attr1\n        self.attr2 = library_instance.attr2\n\n# Usage\nlib_obj = LibraryClass(\"value1\", \"value2\")\nextended_obj = ExtendedClass(lib_obj, extra_attr=\"extra_value\")\n\nprint(extended_obj.attr1)  # Output: value1\nprint(extended_obj.attr2)  # Output: value2\nprint(extended_obj.extra_attr)  # Output: extra_value\n```\n\nBy using this approach, you can effectively convert instances of the library class into instances of your extended class, while also adding any additional functionality or attributes you require."
