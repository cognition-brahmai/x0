It works fine when I use --onedir, but the problem arises when I use --onefile. Upon running the compiled EXE, it cannot find the additional files such as images, although it finds DLLs and other resources. I've noted that the files are present in the temp-directory generated when running the EXE (for example, \\Temp\\_MEI95642\\). The issue is resolved when I place the EXE in that temp-directory. In my .spec file, I've added the following lines:\n\n```\na.datas += [('images/icon.ico', 'D:\\\\[workspace]\\\\App\\\\src\\\\images\\\\icon.ico',  'DATA'),\n('images/loaderani.gif','D:\\\\[workspace]\\\\App\\\\src\\\\images\\\\loaderani.gif','DATA')]    \n```\n\nI've also tried not placing them in subfolders, but it didn't make a difference. Due to a PyInstaller update, I am currently using a newer answer."

        "content": "When creating a standalone executable with PyInstaller using the `--onefile` option, all your files, including additional data files, are bundled into a single executable. However, these files are extracted to a temporary directory at runtime, which is why you're encountering issues accessing them directly.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to ensure your data files are correctly bundled and accessible in a one-file executable:\n\n1. **Modify the .spec file:** Ensure that your .spec file correctly includes the data files. From your description, it seems like you have already added the data files correctly. Ensure the paths are correct and use relative paths if possible.\n\n    ```python\n    a = Analysis(['main.py'],\n                 pathex=['D:\\\\[workspace]\\\\App\\\\src'],\n                 binaries=[],\n                 datas=[('images/icon.ico', 'images/icon.ico'),\n                        ('images/loaderani.gif', 'images/loaderani.gif')],\n                 hiddenimports=[],\n                 hookspath=[],\n                 runtime_hooks=[],\n                 excludes=[],\n                 win_no_prefer_redirects=False,\n                 win_private_assemblies=False,\n                 cipher=block_cipher)\n    ```\n\n2. **Access the files in your code:** Since the files are extracted to a temporary directory, you need to access them using a runtime path. Use the `sys._MEIPASS` attribute to get the path to the temporary directory where the files are extracted. Here's an example of how to access these files:\n\n    ```python\n    import sys\n    import os\n\n    if getattr(sys, 'frozen', False):\n        # If the application is run as a bundle, the PyInstaller bootloader\n        # places the app data in a temporary folder named _MEIPASS\n        base_path = sys._MEIPASS\n    else:\n        base_path = os.path.abspath(\".\")\n\n    icon_path = os.path.join(base_path, 'images', 'icon.ico')\n    loader_gif_path = os.path.join(base_path, 'images', 'loaderani.gif')\n    ```\n\n3. **Rebuild your executable:** After making these changes, regenerate your executable using PyInstaller with the modified .spec file:\n\n    ```bash\n    pyinstaller your_modified_spec_file.spec\n    ```\n\n4. **Testing:** Run the generated .exe file to see if it can access the files correctly using the new path setup.\n\nThis setup should allow your application to access image and icon resources correctly when bundled into a single executable with PyInstaller."
