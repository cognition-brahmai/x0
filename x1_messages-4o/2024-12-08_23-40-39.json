The algorithm must also be able to handle worst-case input scenarios where the array is already sorted. Additionally, output the final sorted array in a table format, with each row containing a maximum of 10 integers, and the last row containing any remaining integers. To make it more challenging, ensure that the sorting algorithm prioritizes odd numbers before even numbers, and sorts the remaining integers in descending order of their second digit."

        "content": "To address this challenge, we need to create a sorting algorithm that can efficiently handle large datasets, remove duplicates, sort the numbers while prioritizing odd numbers, and handle specific formatting requirements for the output. We'll use a modified merge sort algorithm to achieve an \\(O(n \\log n)\\) time complexity.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Remove Duplicates:** We'll use a set to remove duplicates, as sets automatically ensure uniqueness.\n\n2. **Custom Sorting Criteria:**\n   - Prioritize odd numbers over even numbers.\n   - If two numbers are both odd or both even, compare them based on the descending order of their second digit.\n\n3. **Modified Merge Sort:** Merge sort will be adapted to include our custom sorting logic.\n\n4. **Output Formatting:** Format the sorted array into a table with a maximum of 10 integers per row.\n\nLet's implement this solution in Python:\n\n```python\ndef custom_sort_key(x):\n    # Separate logic for determining the second digit\n    str_x = str(x)\n    second_digit = int(str_x[1]) if len(str_x) > 1 else 0\n\n    # Return a tuple that prioritizes odd numbers and sorts by second digit descending\n    return (x % 2 == 0, -second_digit, x)\n\ndef merge_sort(arr):\n    if len(arr) > 1:\n        mid = len(arr) // 2\n        left_half = arr[:mid]\n        right_half = arr[mid:]\n\n        merge_sort(left_half)\n        merge_sort(right_half)\n\n        i = j = k = 0\n\n        while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):\n            if custom_sort_key(left_half[i]) < custom_sort_key(right_half[j]):\n                arr[k] = left_half[i]\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                arr[k] = right_half[j]\n                j += 1\n            k += 1\n\n        while i < len(left_half):\n            arr[k] = left_half[i]\n            i += 1\n            k += 1\n\n        while j < len(right_half):\n            arr[k] = right_half[j]\n            j += 1\n            k += 1\n\ndef sort_and_format(array):\n    # Remove duplicates\n    unique_numbers = list(set(array))\n\n    # Sort using our custom merge sort\n    merge_sort(unique_numbers)\n\n    # Output the sorted numbers in table format\n    for i in range(0, len(unique_numbers), 10):\n        print(\"\\t\".join(map(str, unique_numbers[i:i + 10])))\n\n# Example usage with a large list of numbers\nimport random\n\n# Create a list with 10^6 integers (for demonstration, use a smaller number)\nexample_list = [random.randint(1, 1000) for _ in range(1000000)]\n\nsort_and_format(example_list)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Custom Sort Key:** The `custom_sort_key` function generates a tuple for each number, prioritizing odd numbers, then sorting by the second digit in descending order.\n- **Merge Sort:** A standard merge sort is adapted to use the custom sort key, maintaining \\(O(n \\log n)\\) complexity.\n- **Table Output:** The final sorted list is printed in a table format, with up to 10 numbers per row.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the requirements and constraints, producing the desired output format."
