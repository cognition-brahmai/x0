Currently I am able to create a Client if I have a URL for the WSDL as per the suds documentation.\n\nHere is an example of how I am currently using it:\n\n```python\nfrom suds.client import Client\nurl = 'http://localhost:7080/webservices/WebServiceTestBean?wsdl'\nclient = Client(url)\n```"

Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Ensure that the path to your WSDL file is correct.\n2. Use the `file://` URL scheme to specify the local file path.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom suds.client import Client\n\n# Replace 'path/to/your/wsdlfile.wsdl' with the actual path to your WSDL file\nfile_path = 'file:///path/to/your/wsdlfile.wsdl'\nclient = Client(file_path)\n\n# Now you can use the client as you would with a remote WSDL\nprint(client)\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `'path/to/your/wsdlfile.wsdl'` with the actual path to your WSDL file. Also, ensure that the path is correctly formatted for your operating system (e.g., using forward slashes `/` on Unix-like systems, including macOS and Linux, and double backslashes `\\\\` on Windows)."
