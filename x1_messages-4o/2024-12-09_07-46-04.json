This option tells Bash to read the script and check for syntax errors without running it. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```bash\nbash -n scriptname.sh\n```\n\nReplace `scriptname.sh` with the name of your script. If there are no syntax errors, this command will produce no output and return an exit status of 0. If there are syntax errors, it will display error messages indicating the problems in the script."
