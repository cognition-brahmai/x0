When I attempt to run the command 'eb --version', I receive an error that 'eb' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. My Python version is 3.6.0 and my pip version is 9.0.1. I have successfully installed awsebcli using the 'pip install --upgrade --user awsebcli' command. Here are my environment variables for PATH (see linked image). How can I solve this issue?"

        "content": "It seems like the AWS Elastic Beanstalk CLI isn't being recognized because it's not in your system's PATH. Let's go through some steps to ensure everything is set up correctly:\n\n1. **Verify Installation**: Confirm that the `awsebcli` package is installed by running the following command in your terminal:\n   ```\n   pip show awsebcli\n   ```\n   This should display details about the package if it is installed correctly.\n\n2. **Locate the Installation Path**: Determine where `awsebcli` has been installed. You can use the following command to find out:\n   ```\n   python -m site --user-base\n   ```\n   This will typically output a directory path like `C:\\Users\\<YourUsername>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python\\Python36\\Scripts`.\n\n3. **Add to PATH**: Once you have identified the directory, you need to add the `Scripts` subdirectory to your system\u2019s PATH environment variable:\n   - Open the Start Menu, search for \"Environment Variables\" and select \"Edit the system environment variables\".\n   - Click on \"Environment Variables\".\n   - Under \"User variables\" (or \"System variables\"), find and select the \"Path\" variable, then click \"Edit\".\n   - Click \"New\" and add the path to the `Scripts` directory, which might look something like `C:\\Users\\<YourUsername>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python\\Python36\\Scripts`.\n   - Click \"OK\" to close all the dialog boxes.\n\n4. **Restart Command Prompt**: After updating the PATH, close any open Command Prompt windows and open a new one for the changes to take effect.\n\n5. **Check the Installation**: Now try running `eb --version` again to see if the command is recognized.\n\n6. **Verify Python and Pip Versions**: Ensure that the python and pip versions you have installed are compatible with awsebcli. It's a good practice to use the latest versions, so consider upgrading if necessary. You can upgrade pip by running:\n   ```\n   python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n   ```\n\n7. **Check for Multiple Python Installations**: If you have multiple Python installations, ensure you are using the one where `awsebcli` is installed. You can check which Python is being used with:\n   ```\n   where python\n   ```\n\nIf you follow these steps and still encounter issues, consider reinstalling `awsebcli` using:\n```\npip uninstall awsebcli\npip install awsebcli --user\n```\nThis process ensures a clean installation.
