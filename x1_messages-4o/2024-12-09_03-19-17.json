When there is a lot of data in the dataframe, the heatmap becomes too small, making the values inside unclear. How can I increase the size of the heatmap? I have tried the following code:\n\n```\ndf1.index = pd.to_datetime(df1.index)\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,10))         # Sample figsize in inches\nsns.heatmap(df1.iloc[:, 1:6:], annot=True, linewidths=.5, ax=ax)\ndf1 = df1.set_index('TIMESTAMP')\ndf1 = df1.resample('1d').mean()\nax = sns.heatmap(df1.iloc[:, 1:6:], annot=True, linewidths=.5)\n```\n\nHowever, I am receiving a KeyError: 'TIMESTAMP'. Also, when I tried resampling the data and creating the heatmap, I got a TypeError: ufunc 'isnan' not supported for the input types, and the inputs could not be safely coerced to any supported types according to the casting rule ''safe''. What am I doing wrong and how can I resolve these issues?"

        "content": "To address the issues you're facing with the heatmap and the errors, let's break down the problems and solutions one by one.\n\n### 1. KeyError: 'TIMESTAMP'\nThe `KeyError: 'TIMESTAMP'` suggests that the column `'TIMESTAMP'` is not present in your DataFrame. Here are a few steps to resolve this:\n\n- **Check Column Names**: Ensure that the column name `'TIMESTAMP'` exists in your DataFrame. You can check this by printing `df1.columns`.\n\n```python\nprint(df1.columns)\n```\n\n- **Correct Column Name**: If the column name is different, use the correct name. If there's a typo, correct it.\n\n### 2. Adjusting Heatmap Size\nTo make the heatmap larger and more readable, you can increase the `figsize` in the `plt.subplots()` function. You've already set `figsize=(10,10)`, but you might want to increase it further depending on your data size. For example:\n\n```python\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15, 15))  # Larger figure size\n```\n\n### 3. Resampling Data\nThe `TypeError` you're encountering suggests that there may be non-numeric data in the DataFrame, which is causing issues during the resampling operation. Make sure that the data you want to resample is numeric. You can check and convert columns if necessary:\n\n- **Check Data Types**: Ensure the data can be resampled. Non-numeric data can't be directly averaged.\n\n```python\nprint(df1.dtypes)\n```\n\n- **Convert Data Types**: If you find non-numeric types that should be numeric, convert them.\n\n```python\ndf1['your_column_name'] = pd.to_numeric(df1['your_column_name'], errors='coerce')\n```\n\n- **Resample after Setting Index**: Make sure to set the index before resampling.\n\n```python\ndf1.index = pd.to_datetime(df1.index)\ndf1 = df1.resample('1d').mean()\n```\n\n### 4. Creating the Heatmap\nAfter ensuring that your data is correctly formatted and resampled, create the heatmap:\n\n```python\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15, 15))  # Adjusted figsize\nsns.heatmap(df1.iloc[:, 1:6], annot=True, linewidths=.5, ax=ax)\n```\n\nMake sure that `df1.iloc[:, 1:6]` selects the correct columns you want to visualize in the heatmap. Adjust the column slice as per your DataFrame.\n\n### Final Code\nHere's a combined version of the code with adjustments:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Ensure TIMESTAMP is part of the DataFrame\nprint(df1.columns)  # Debugging step\n\n# Convert index to datetime\ndf1.index = pd.to_datetime(df1.index)\n\n# Check and convert any necessary columns to numeric\nfor col in df1.columns:\n    df1[col] = pd.to_numeric(df1[col], errors='coerce')\n\n# Resample data\ndf1 = df1.resample('1d').mean()\n\n# Plot heatmap\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15, 15))  # Adjusted figsize\nsns.heatmap(df1.iloc[:, 1:6], annot=True, linewidths=.5, ax=ax)\nplt.show()\n```\n\nBy following these steps and ensuring your data is correctly prepared, you should be able to resolve the issues and create a clear, readable heatmap."
