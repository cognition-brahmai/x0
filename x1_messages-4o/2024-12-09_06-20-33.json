Can I also specify to pandas to use either a tab (\\t) or spaces as the separator? Below is the current code I am using:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv('myfile.dat', sep = '    ')\n```\n\nThe data files I am working with have columns separated by different numbers of spaces, and I currently have to manually check each file to determine the number of spaces and specify that in the 'sep' parameter."

        "content": "You can handle the varying number of spaces as separators in your data files by using a regular expression with the `sep` parameter in the `pandas.read_csv` function. Specifically, you can use `\\s+` to match any whitespace (including spaces and tabs) and indicate one or more occurrences. Additionally, you can use the `engine='python'` parameter to allow for the regular expression to be processed correctly.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Use a regular expression to specify any whitespace as a separator\ndf = pd.read_csv('myfile.dat', sep=r'\\s+', engine='python')\n```\n\nThis will allow `pandas` to treat any sequence of whitespace (spaces or tabs) as a separator, so you don't need to manually check each file for the number of spaces. The `r` before the string `'\\s+'` is used to indicate a raw string, which is helpful when dealing with backslashes in regular expressions."
