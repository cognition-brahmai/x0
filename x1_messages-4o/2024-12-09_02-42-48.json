For example, when I round 1.5, it rounds to 2.0, but when I round 10.5, it rounds to 10.0. I'm not sure why 1.5 is being rounded up while 10.5 is rounded down. Could this be due to the inaccuracy of floats? Furthermore, is there a way to achieve the desired functionality where a number ending in .5 is always rounded up to the next integer, regardless of whether the number is even or odd?\n\nHere is the code I am referring to:\n\n```python\nnp.rint(1.5)  # Outputs: 2.0\nnp.rint(10.5)  # Outputs: 10.0\n```"

        "content": "What you're observing with `numpy.rint()` is actually due to the \"round half to even\" strategy, also known as \"bankers' rounding.\" This method rounds to the nearest even number when the number is exactly halfway between two integers. This is why 1.5 rounds to 2.0 (since 2 is even) and 10.5 rounds to 10.0 (since 10 is even).\n\nThis behavior is designed to reduce statistical bias that can accumulate when rounding many numbers. However, if you specifically want to round .5 always up to the next integer, you can use `numpy.ceil()` after subtracting a small epsilon value:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef round_half_up(x):\n    return np.ceil(x - 0.5)\n\nprint(round_half_up(1.5))  # Outputs: 2.0\nprint(round_half_up(10.5)) # Outputs: 11.0\n```\n\nThis function adjusts the number slightly before applying the ceiling function to ensure that .5 is always rounded up. Note that this approach assumes positive numbers; if you need it to work correctly with negative numbers, you'll need to adjust the logic slightly."
