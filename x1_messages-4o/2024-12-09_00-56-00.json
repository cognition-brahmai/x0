However, I'm having difficulty finding where these are defined in Pyramid. Is there an existing set of users/groups/permissions built into Pyramid that I can import without having to define these objects/mappings and hash/salting of passwords myself? Or do I have to create my own?"

        "content": "Pyramid is a very flexible web framework that doesn't come with a pre-defined user/group/permission system like Django does. This is by design, as Pyramid aims to be minimal and lets you choose the components that best fit your application's needs.\n\nHowever, you don't have to build everything from scratch if you don't want to. There are several third-party libraries and packages that can help you implement authentication and authorization in Pyramid:\n\n1. **pyramid_authsanity**: This is a simple authentication policy that can handle hashed passwords and session management. It provides a straightforward way to manage user sessions and check credentials.\n\n2. **pyramid_basemodel**: This package offers a base model for SQLAlchemy which you can extend to create user models. It's a good starting point if you want to integrate SQLAlchemy with Pyramid.\n\n3. **pyramid_jwt**: If you're interested in using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication, this package provides a JWT-based authentication policy.\n\n4. **pyramid_fullauth**: This is a more comprehensive package that offers user registration, password recovery, and more. It can save you a lot of time if you need these features.\n\n5. **Colander and Deform**: These libraries are not specifically for authentication, but they are useful for form validation and rendering, which can be helpful when creating user registration and login forms.\n\n6. **Passlib**: While not specific to Pyramid, Passlib is an excellent library for password hashing and salting, making it easy to handle passwords securely.\n\nWhen implementing authentication and authorization in Pyramid, you'll typically define a user model using SQLAlchemy, create an authentication policy, and set up access control lists (ACLs) for your resources.\n\nHere's a very basic example of how you might set up user authentication in Pyramid using SQLAlchemy and bcrypt for password hashing:\n\n1. **Define your user model:**\n\n   ```python\n   from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String\n   from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n   from passlib.hash import bcrypt\n\n   Base = declarative_base()\n\n   class User(Base):\n       __tablename__ = 'users'\n       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n       username = Column(String(50), unique=True)\n       password_hash = Column(String(128))\n\n       def set_password(self, password):\n           self.password_hash = bcrypt.hash(password)\n\n       def check_password(self, password):\n           return bcrypt.verify(password, self.password_hash)\n   ```\n\n2. **Set up an authentication policy:**\n\n   You can use `pyramid_authsanity` or write your own policy. Here's a simple example using sessions:\n\n   ```python\n   from pyramid.authentication import AuthTktAuthenticationPolicy\n   from pyramid.authorization import ACLAuthorizationPolicy\n\n   def get_user(request):\n       user_id = request.authenticated_userid\n       if user_id is not None:\n           return request.dbsession.query(User).get(user_id)\n\n   def main(global_config, **settings):\n       # ... (other setup code) ...\n       authn_policy = AuthTktAuthenticationPolicy('secret', callback=get_user)\n       authz_policy = ACLAuthorizationPolicy()\n       config.set_authentication_policy(authn_policy)\n       config.set_authorization_policy(authz_policy)\n       # ...\n   ```\n\n3. **Create views for login and registration:**\n\n   Implement views where users can register and log in, using forms to gather user input and validate credentials.\n\nRemember, these are just starting points. You can customize the authentication and authorization logic to meet your specific requirements."
