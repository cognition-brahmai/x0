        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the arrangement of colors for the walls of the room. Assuming the room is a simple rectangular shape, it will have four walls. The condition is that no adjacent walls can have the same color.\n\nLet's denote the walls as \\( W_1, W_2, W_3, \\) and \\( W_4 \\), where each wall must be painted a different color from its adjacent walls.\n\n1. Choose a color for \\( W_1 \\). There are 4 options: blue, green, red, or yellow.\n\n2. Choose a color for \\( W_2 \\). Since \\( W_2 \\) is adjacent to \\( W_1 \\), it cannot be the same color as \\( W_1 \\). Thus, there are 3 options left.\n\n3. Choose a color for \\( W_3 \\). Since \\( W_3 \\) is adjacent to \\( W_2 \\), it cannot be the same color as \\( W_2 \\). So again, there are 3 options available.\n\n4. Choose a color for \\( W_4 \\). \\( W_4 \\) is adjacent to both \\( W_1 \\) and \\( W_3 \\), so its color must be different from both. However, since \\( W_1 \\) and \\( W_3 \\) can be the same color, \\( W_4 \\) will have 2 options (it must be different from the color used for \\( W_3 \\), and if \\( W_3 \\) is different from \\( W_1 \\), it will also be different from \\( W_1 \\)).\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of combinations:\n\n\\[\n4 \\text{ (choices for } W_1) \\times 3 \\text{ (choices for } W_2) \\times 3 \\text{ (choices for } W_3) \\times 2 \\text{ (choices for } W_4) = 72\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are 72 different color combinations possible for painting the room such that no adjacent walls have the same color."
