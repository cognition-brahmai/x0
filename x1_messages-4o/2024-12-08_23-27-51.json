To accomplish this task, I'll provide a command using `translate-shell` to translate the phrase \"never give up\" into Spanish, while also including a mathematical expression to determine the length of the translated phrase.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```bash\ntranslated_phrase=$(trans -b :es \"never give up\")\nphrase_length=$(echo -n \"$translated_phrase\" | wc -c)\n\necho \"Translated Phrase: $translated_phrase\"\necho \"Length of Translated Phrase: $phrase_length\"\necho \"Mathematical Expression: $(( $phrase_length / 2 + $phrase_length / 2 ))\"\n```\n\nThis command translates the phrase \"never give up\" into Spanish using `translate-shell`, calculates the length of the translated phrase, and includes a mathematical expression that equals the length of that phrase. The mathematical expression used here is simply dividing the length by 2 and multiplying back to match the length, demonstrating a basic arithmetic operation."
