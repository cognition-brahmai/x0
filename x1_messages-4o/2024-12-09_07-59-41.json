The Python documentation refers to \"containers\" quite often, but I haven't been able to find an official definition or a comprehensive list of them. Also, can you confirm if the built-in types I checked are indeed containers or not?"

        "content": "In Python, the term \"containers\" refers to objects that can hold and manage collections of other objects. Containers are data structures that store multiple elements, allowing for iteration over those elements, and often provide mechanisms for adding, removing, and organizing the stored data.\n\nHere's a list of common Python container types:\n\n1. **List**: An ordered, mutable collection of elements. Lists allow duplicate elements and support various operations like adding, removing, and slicing.\n\n2. **Tuple**: An ordered, immutable collection of elements. Tuples are similar to lists but cannot be modified after creation.\n\n3. **Set**: An unordered collection of unique elements. Sets do not allow duplicate elements and support operations like union, intersection, and difference.\n\n4. **Dictionary**: An unordered collection of key-value pairs. Dictionaries map keys to values, allowing for fast retrieval of values based on their keys.\n\n5. **String**: While primarily used for text, strings can be considered containers of characters. They are immutable sequences of characters.\n\n6. **Byte and Bytearray**: Containers for bytes, where `bytes` is immutable and `bytearray` is mutable.\n\n7. **Deque**: A double-ended queue that allows appending and popping elements from both ends. It is part of the `collections` module.\n\n8. **Frozenset**: An immutable version of a set that cannot be modified after creation.\n\n9. **Array**: Provided by the `array` module, arrays are similar to lists but can hold only elements of the same type and are more memory-efficient.\n\n10. **Namedtuple**: A factory function for creating tuple subclasses with named fields, part of the `collections` module.\n\n11. **Heapq**: Implements a priority queue using a heap, part of the `heapq` module.\n\n12. **Queue**: Provides different types of queue implementations like FIFO, LIFO, and PriorityQueue, available in the `queue` module.\n\nTo confirm if certain built-in types are containers, we can use Python's `collections.abc` module, which defines the abstract base classes for containers. If a type is an instance of `collections.abc.Container`, it is considered a container.\n\nFor example:\n- List, Tuple, Set, Dictionary: Yes, they're containers.\n- String: Yes, it's a container of characters.\n- Integer, Float: No, they're not containers.\n\nLet me know if you have specific types you want to verify as containers!"
