When I attempt to include quotation marks inside the string, like this: `print \" \"a word that needs quotation marks\" \"`, it appears to be closing the string prematurely, which prevents me from adding the word I need inside the quotation marks. What is the correct way to do this?"

        "content": "To include quotation marks inside a string in Python, you have a few different options. Here are some common methods:\n\n1. **Using Escape Characters**: You can use a backslash (`\\`) to escape the quotation marks within the string.\n\n    ```python\n    print(\" \\\"a word that needs quotation marks\\\" \")\n    ```\n\n    This tells Python to treat the quotation marks inside the string as literal characters rather than as the end of the string.\n\n2. **Using Single Quotes for the Outer String**: If you use single quotes to define the string, you can include double quotes inside without any issues.\n\n    ```python\n    print(' \"a word that needs quotation marks\" ')\n    ```\n\n    This works because Python will not confuse the double quotes inside the string with the single quotes used to define the string.\n\n3. **Using Triple Quotes**: Triple quotes allow you to define a string that spans multiple lines and includes both single and double quotes without escaping them.\n\n    ```python\n    print(\"\"\" \"a word that needs quotation marks\" \"\"\")\n    ```\n\nAny of these methods will allow you to include quotation marks inside your string in Python. Choose the one that best suits your needs or coding style."
