        "content": "The terms \"web server\" and \"application server\" are often used in the context of serving web applications, but they have distinct roles and functionalities:\n\n1. **Web Server:**\n   - **Purpose:** Primarily handles HTTP requests. It serves static content such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and videos to the client (usually a web browser).\n   - **Functionality:** Its main job is to deliver web pages to users. It can also handle simple dynamic content generation by using scripting languages like PHP, Python, or Ruby, often through integrations or modules.\n   - **Examples:** Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, Microsoft IIS.\n\n2. **Application Server:**\n   - **Purpose:** Facilitates the hosting and execution of dynamic content and applications. It provides business logic to application programs through various protocols, often beyond HTTP, such as RMI, RPC, or SOAP.\n   - **Functionality:** Manages and executes the business logic for applications. It can handle complex transactions, data processing, and integration with databases. Application servers often provide features like transaction management, messaging, security, and load balancing.\n   - **Examples:** Apache Tomcat (often used as a web server too), JBoss (WildFly), IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic.\n\n**Key Differences:**\n- **Content Served:** Web servers are primarily for static content, while application servers are for dynamic content and business logic.\n- **Protocols Used:** Web servers mainly use HTTP/HTTPS, whereas application servers may use various protocols in addition to HTTP/HTTPS.\n- **Complexity and Features:** Application servers offer more in terms of features like connection pooling, object pooling, and transactions, which are essential for enterprise-level applications.\n\nIn modern architectures, web servers and application servers are often used together, with the web server handling incoming requests and routing them to the application server for processing."
