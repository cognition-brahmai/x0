I am currently using the command `tar -cjf site1.bz2 /var/www/site1/` in a backup shell script. However, when I list the contents of the archive, the full paths are stored. I would like to simplify extraction and avoid an unnecessary constant directory structure, especially if I need to extract the backup websites in a location where web data is not stored under `/var/www`. I have tried using the -C option and `--strip-components=3` in various ways, but none of them have worked as expected. Some do nothing, while others don't archive sub-directories anymore."

        "content": "To archive a directory using the `tar` command without storing the full absolute paths, you can use the `-C` option to change to the directory you want to archive and then specify the directory's contents. This way, the paths stored in the archive will be relative to the directory you changed to, rather than the full absolute paths.\n\nHere is how you can modify your script to achieve this:\n\n```bash\ntar -cjf site1.bz2 -C /var/www site1\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what this command does:\n\n- `-c`: Creates a new archive.\n- `-j`: Filters the archive through `bzip2`.\n- `-f site1.bz2`: Specifies the name of the archive file to create.\n- `-C /var/www`: Changes to the `/var/www` directory before adding files to the archive.\n- `site1`: Specifies the directory to archive, relative to the `/var/www` directory.\n\nBy using this approach, the directory structure within the archive will start from `site1` instead of the full `/var/www/site1` path. This makes extraction simpler and avoids embedding the full original path in the archive, which allows you to extract the archive into any desired location without unnecessary directory nesting."
