I installed it using the following commands:\n\n```\nsudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1404-7-5-local_7.5-18_amd64.deb\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install cuda\n```\nFollowing installation, I can't find the /usr/local/cuda* folder. When I try to re-install CUDA, it says that it is already the newest version. \n\n```\nsudo apt-get install cuda\nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information... Done\ncuda is already the newest version.\n```\nWhen I try to access the cuda folder, it says no such file or directory exists. \n\n```\nls /usr/local/cuda*\nls: cannot access /usr/local/cuda*: No such file or directory\n```\nAlso, the system does not seem to find 'nvcc'.\n\n```\nnvcc\nThe program 'nvcc' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-toolkit\n\nsudo find /usr/ -name nvcc\n<no output>\n```\nWhat could be the issue?"

        "content": "It sounds like the CUDA installation did not complete properly or the paths are not set correctly. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify Installation**:\n   - Check if the CUDA packages are installed correctly:\n     ```bash\n     dpkg -l | grep cuda\n     ```\n\n2. **Reinstall CUDA**:\n   - Sometimes, simply reinstalling can resolve missing files:\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt-get remove --purge cuda\n     sudo apt-get update\n     sudo apt-get install cuda\n     ```\n\n3. **Check PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH**:\n   - Ensure that the environment variables are set correctly. Add the following lines to your `~/.bashrc` file:\n     ```bash\n     export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-7.5/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}\n     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-7.5/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}\n     ```\n   - After editing `~/.bashrc`, run:\n     ```bash\n     source ~/.bashrc\n     ```\n\n4. **Check Symbolic Link**:\n   - Make sure there is a symbolic link to the CUDA directory. If not, create it manually:\n     ```bash\n     sudo ln -s /usr/local/cuda-7.5 /usr/local/cuda\n     ```\n\n5. **Check Installation Directory**:\n   - Manually inspect the `/usr/local/` directory to see if there's a `cuda-7.5` folder:\n     ```bash\n     ls /usr/local\n     ```\n\n6. **Install NVIDIA Driver**:\n   - Ensure that the NVIDIA driver is correctly installed and compatible with the CUDA version. You can check this by running:\n     ```bash\n     nvidia-smi\n     ```\n\n7. **Install CUDA Toolkit**:\n   - If `nvcc` is not found, install the CUDA toolkit manually:\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-toolkit\n     ```\n\nAfter following these steps, you should be able to find `/usr/local/cuda`, and `nvcc` should be recognized. If you continue to experience issues, consider reviewing installation logs for errors and consulting the NVIDIA forums for additional support."
