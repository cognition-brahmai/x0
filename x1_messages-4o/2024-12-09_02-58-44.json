My script updates the data of the plot based on some calculations and I want the ylim and xlim to be automatically rescaled each time. However, the scale appears to be set based on the limits of the initial plot. Here's a Minimal Working Example (MWE) of my code:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot\n\npyplot.ion()\n\nx = range(10)\ny = lambda m: [m*random.random() for i in range(10)]\n\npLine, = pyplot.plot(x, y(1))\n\nfor i in range(10):\n    pLine.set_ydata(y(i+1))\n    pyplot.draw()\n```\n\nInitially, the plot command generates a plot that ranges from [0,1] and I can see everything fine. But as the y-data array increases from [0,10) with majority of the values being greater than 1, the y-limits of the figure remain [0,1]. I'm aware that I can manually change the limits using `pyplot.ylim(...)`, but I don't know the new limits to set. Is there a way for me to tell pyplot to scale the limits as if it was the first time being plotted during the `for` loop?"

        "content": "To have Matplotlib automatically adjust the limits of your plot each time new data is set, you can use the `relim()` and `autoscale_view()` methods. The `relim()` method recalculates the data limits based on the current data in the plot, and `autoscale_view()` adjusts the view limits using the recalculated data limits.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to automatically rescale the limits with each update:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nplt.ion()\n\nx = range(10)\ny = lambda m: [m * random.random() for i in range(10)]\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\npLine, = ax.plot(x, y(1))\n\nfor i in range(10):\n    pLine.set_ydata(y(i + 1))\n    ax.relim()           # Recalculate limits based on the updated data\n    ax.autoscale_view()  # Rescale view limits\n    plt.draw()\n    plt.pause(0.5)       # Pause to allow the plot to update\n```\n\nIn this modified version, the `relim()` function is called to recompute the data limits for the axes, and then `autoscale_view()` is used to adjust the axes view limits to the newly computed data limits. Adding `plt.pause(0.5)` ensures that the plot updates are visible by introducing a short pause between updates. Adjust the pause duration as needed for your application."
