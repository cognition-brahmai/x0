        "content": "To split a generator into chunks without pre-walking it, accumulating data in memory, or padding the chunks, you can modify your approach slightly. The key is to consume the generator only as needed and to stop iteration when the generator is exhausted. You can achieve this by checking if the `head` function yields any elements and breaking the loop in the `chunks` function when it doesn't.\n\nHere's a refined version of your code that addresses these requirements:\n\n```python\ndef head(iterable, max_size):\n    cnt = 0\n    for el in iterable:\n        yield el\n        cnt += 1\n        if cnt >= max_size:\n            break\n\ndef chunks(iterable, chunk_size):\n    iterator = iter(iterable)\n    while True:\n        chunk = list(head(iterator, chunk_size))\n        if not chunk:  # Stop if no more elements are yielded\n            break\n        yield chunk\n\n# Sample generator: the real data is much more complex, and expensive to compute\nels = range(7)\n\nfor n, chunk in enumerate(chunks(els, 2)):\n    for el in chunk:\n        print('Chunk %3d, value %d' % (n, el))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **`head` function**: This function yields up to `max_size` elements from the iterable. If fewer elements are available, it yields whatever is left. The `cnt` variable is used to keep track of the number of elements yielded.\n\n2. **`chunks` function**: This function iterates over the input iterable, using `head` to fetch chunks of the specified size. It converts the result of `head` to a list to check if any elements were yielded. If the list is empty, it breaks out of the loop, indicating that the generator is exhausted.\n\n3. **Stopping Condition**: The `chunks` function stops when `head` yields no elements, which means the generator has been exhausted.\n\nThis approach ensures that the generator is consumed lazily, without pre-walking, padding, or unnecessary memory accumulation."
