        "content": "To determine how many years it would take for the Earth's average temperature to increase by an additional 1.2 degrees Celsius at a constant rate, let's first calculate the rate of temperature increase since 1880.\n\n1. **Determine the time span from 1880 to now:**\n   - From 1880 to 2023 is 143 years.\n\n2. **Calculate the rate of temperature increase per year:**\n   - The temperature has increased by 0.8 degrees Celsius over 143 years.\n   - Rate of increase = 0.8 degrees / 143 years = approximately 0.005594 degrees per year.\n\n3. **Determine the time required for an additional increase of 1.2 degrees Celsius:**\n   - Time needed = Additional temperature increase / Rate of increase\n   - Time needed = 1.2 degrees / 0.005594 degrees per year \u2248 214.6 years\n\nRounding 214.6 to the nearest whole number gives us 215 years.\n\nTherefore, it would take approximately 215 years for the Earth's average temperature to rise by an additional 1.2 degrees Celsius at the current rate of increase."
