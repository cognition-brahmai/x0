However, when I attempt to calculate the recall score with the 'binary' average, I receive the error: ValueError: pos_label=1 is not a valid label: array(['neg', 'pos'], dtype='<U3'). I attempted to resolve this by transforming 'pos' into 1 and 'neg' into 0, but this resulted in another error: ValueError: Mix of label input types (string and number). How can I correctly calculate the recall score without encountering these errors?\n\nHere is my code:\n\n```python\nX_test = test_pos_vec + test_neg_vec\nY_test = [\"pos\"] * len(test_pos_vec) + [\"neg\"] * len(test_neg_vec)\n\nrecall_average = recall_score(Y_test, y_predict, average=\"binary\")\n\nprint(recall_average)\n```\n\nThis is the code I used to transform the 'pos' and 'neg' labels:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(len(Y_test)):\n     if 'neg' in Y_test[i]:\n         Y_test[i] = 0\n     else:\n         Y_test[i] = 1\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering stems from inconsistencies in label types. Initially, your labels are strings ('pos' and 'neg'), and when you try to convert them to integers (0 and 1), you encounter mixed types in your dataset, which causes the error.\n\nTo resolve this, you should ensure that both `Y_test` and `y_predict` are consistently using the same numeric labels. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve that:\n\n1. Convert both `Y_test` and `y_predict` to numeric labels.\n2. Use these numeric labels when calculating the recall score.\n\nHere's an example of how you can do this:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.metrics import recall_score\n\n# Example test vectors\nX_test = test_pos_vec + test_neg_vec\nY_test = [\"pos\"] * len(test_pos_vec) + [\"neg\"] * len(test_neg_vec)\n\n# Convert 'pos' and 'neg' to 1 and 0\nY_test_numeric = [1 if label == 'pos' else 0 for label in Y_test]\n\n# Assuming y_predict follows the same 'pos'/'neg' structure\ny_predict_numeric = [1 if label == 'pos' else 0 for label in y_predict]\n\n# Calculate recall score\nrecall_average = recall_score(Y_test_numeric, y_predict_numeric, average=\"binary\")\n\nprint(recall_average)\n```\n\nMake sure that `y_predict` is also converted in the same manner as `Y_test`. This way, you maintain consistency in the label types, and you should be able to calculate the recall score without any errors."
