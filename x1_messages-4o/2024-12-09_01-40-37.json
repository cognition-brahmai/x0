For your specific case, where you want to change the entries in column 'A' to the number 16 for rows 0 to 15, you can do this using slicing. Here's how you can achieve it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create the DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randint(0, 100, size=(100, 2)), columns=list('AB'))\n\n# Replace values in column 'A' from index 0 to 15 with 16\ndf.loc[0:15, 'A'] = 16\n\n# Display the DataFrame to verify the changes\nprint(df)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `df.loc[0:15, 'A']` accesses rows 0 to 15 in column 'A'.\n- `= 16` assigns the value 16 to these positions.\n\nThis operation will update the specified entries in the DataFrame with the desired value."
