        "content": "Certainly! To create a plant recommendation system for hot and dry climates using Ruby, you'd want to consider plants that are drought-tolerant and can thrive in high temperatures. Some common plant suggestions for such climates include succulents, cacti, lavender, and rosemary.\n\nBelow is a simple Ruby code snippet for a plant recommendation system based on temperature and humidity:\n\n```ruby\nclass Plant\n  attr_reader :name, :temperature_range, :humidity_range\n\n  def initialize(name, temperature_range, humidity_range)\n    @name = name\n    @temperature_range = temperature_range\n    @humidity_range = humidity_range\n  end\n\n  def suitable_for?(temperature, humidity)\n    temperature_range.include?(temperature) && humidity_range.include?(humidity)\n  end\nend\n\nclass PlantRecommender\n  def initialize\n    @plants = [\n      Plant.new(\"Succulent\", 20..45, 10..30),\n      Plant.new(\"Cactus\", 25..50, 5..20),\n      Plant.new(\"Lavender\", 15..35, 20..40),\n      Plant.new(\"Rosemary\", 10..30, 30..50)\n    ]\n  end\n\n  def recommend(temperature, humidity)\n    suitable_plants = @plants.select { |plant| plant.suitable_for?(temperature, humidity) }\n    if suitable_plants.empty?\n      \"No suitable plants found for the given conditions.\"\n    else\n      \"Recommended plants: \" + suitable_plants.map(&:name).join(\", \")\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nrecommender = PlantRecommender.new\nputs recommender.recommend(30, 15) # Adjust temperature and humidity values as needed\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Plant Class**: Represents a plant with a name, temperature range, and humidity range.\n- **suitable_for? Method**: Checks if a plant can thrive in given temperature and humidity conditions.\n- **PlantRecommender Class**: Contains a list of plants and a method to recommend suitable plants based on input conditions.\n- **Example Usage**: You can input different temperature and humidity values to see which plants are recommended.\n\nThis code provides a basic framework and can be expanded with more plants and features as needed."
