        "content": "In Python, an object is considered \"subscriptable\" if it supports the use of the subscript notation, which is typically used to access elements or slices of the object using square brackets (`[]`). This means the object implements the `__getitem__` method, allowing you to retrieve values by index or key.\n\n**Examples of subscriptable objects include:**\n\n1. **Lists**: You can access elements using their index.\n   ```python\n   my_list = [10, 20, 30]\n   print(my_list[1])  # Output: 20\n   ```\n\n2. **Tuples**: Similar to lists, elements can be accessed by their index.\n   ```python\n   my_tuple = (10, 20, 30)\n   print(my_tuple[2])  # Output: 30\n   ```\n\n3. **Strings**: You can access characters using their index.\n   ```python\n   my_string = \"Hello\"\n   print(my_string[0])  # Output: H\n   ```\n\n4. **Dictionaries**: You can access values by their key.\n   ```python\n   my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n   print(my_dict['a'])  # Output: 1\n   ```\n\n5. **Sets and Frozensets**: While you cannot directly access elements by index or key because they are unordered collections, you can iterate over them which implicitly uses subscripting.\n\nIf you try to subscript an object that doesn't support it, Python will raise a `TypeError` indicating that the object is not subscriptable. For example, trying to subscript an integer will yield such an error:\n\n```python\nnumber = 42\nprint(number[0])  # Raises TypeError: 'int' object is not subscriptable\n```\n\nIn summary, a subscriptable object is one that allows you to use the subscript notation to access its elements, typically because it implements the `__getitem__` method."
