However, every time I add a new member to the class, I have to go back and modify the constructor. Is there a more efficient way to automatically set these member variables in Python? Here is my current code:\n\n```python\nclass Foo(object):\n    a = None\n    b = None\n    c = None\n    def __init__(self, a = None, b = None, c = None):\n        self.a = a\n        self.b = b\n        self.c = c\n```"

        "content": "Yes, there's a more efficient way to handle setting class member variables in Python using the `**kwargs` feature in combination with the `setattr` function. This way, you can easily add new member variables without modifying the constructor each time. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nclass Foo(object):\n    a = None\n    b = None\n    c = None\n\n    def __init__(self, **kwargs):\n        for key, value in kwargs.items():\n            setattr(self, key, value)\n\n# Example of usage:\nfoo_instance = Foo(a=10, b=20, c=30, d=40)  # You can add additional parameters as needed\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`**kwargs`**: This allows you to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to the function. It collects all the keyword arguments passed into a dictionary named `kwargs`.\n\n- **`setattr`**: This built-in function sets the attribute of the object. It takes three parameters: the object, the attribute name (as a string), and the value to be set.\n\nWith this setup, you can create an instance of `Foo` with any number of attributes, and they will automatically be assigned to the instance. This makes extending the class with new attributes much more flexible and requires minimal changes to the code."
