This error occurs when my code checks if a selected organization is present in the user's organizations. If it isn't, it should return an Http404 error. Here's the code in question:\n\n```python\nif not selected_organization in request.user.organizations.all():\n    return Http404\n```\n\nHowever, when trying to return the Http404, I get the following error message: `type object 'Http404' has no attribute 'get'`. How can I correctly implement this?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the way you're trying to raise the `Http404` exception. In Django, `Http404` is an exception that should be raised, not returned. When you use `return Http404`, it treats `Http404` as a response object, which is why you're encountering the error indicating that it has no attribute 'get'.\n\nTo correctly implement this, you should raise the `Http404` exception instead of returning it. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nfrom django.http import Http404\n\nif selected_organization not in request.user.organizations.all():\n    raise Http404(\"Organization not found.\")\n```\n\nBy using `raise Http404`, you're telling Django to stop processing and return a 404 error to the user. The message \"Organization not found.\" is optional and can provide additional context when debugging, but it won't be shown to the user by default."
