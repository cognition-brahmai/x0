The email is regarding a specific feedback topic related to the quality of your product. \nYour task is to come up with a subject line for the reply email that includes John's name and the feedback topic mentioned. However, there's a catch - you can only use mathematical operations to create the subject line! \nFor example, if John's feedback topic was \"shipping delay\", you could create a subject line like this: \n\"John's shipping delay feedback = ?\" \nCan you come up with a subject line using only mathematical operations that will make sense to John and accurately reflect the feedback topic he mentioned?"

        "content": "Certainly! Let's say John's feedback topic is \"product quality\". A subject line using mathematical operations could be:\n\n\"John's product quality feedback = \u221a(attention\u00b2 + improvement\u00b2)\" \n\nThis subject line implies that you're focusing on both attention to the issue and potential improvements, all while incorporating a mathematical operation theme."
