        "content": "Certainly! When designing a machine, the process typically involves several key stages, and when described in passive voice, the focus shifts from the engineer to the actions themselves. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Requirement Analysis**: The needs and specifications for the machine are gathered and analyzed. This involves understanding the purpose of the machine and the requirements it must meet.\n\n2. **Conceptual Design**: Various design concepts are brainstormed and evaluated. Initial sketches and models are created to explore potential solutions.\n\n3. **Detailed Design**: The chosen concept is developed in detail. This includes creating detailed drawings and specifications. Materials are selected, and dimensions are finalized.\n\n4. **Prototyping**: A prototype of the machine is constructed to test the design. The prototype is evaluated and tested to ensure it meets the necessary requirements and performs as expected.\n\n5. **Testing and Validation**: The design is rigorously tested. Any issues are identified, and modifications are made as needed to improve the machine's performance.\n\n6. **Finalization**: The design is finalized, and detailed documentation is prepared. Production plans are developed, and the machine is made ready for manufacturing.\n\n7. **Manufacturing**: The machine is manufactured based on the finalized design and specifications.\n\nUsing passive voice, here is an example sentence that describes a specific step in the engineer's design process:\n\n\"The prototype of the automated packaging machine was developed by the engineering team after the initial concept was selected, and its performance was meticulously tested against the predefined criteria to ensure functionality and efficiency.\"\n\nIn this sentence, the focus is on the actions\u2014developing the prototype and testing its performance\u2014rather than on the engineers themselves."
