        "content": "I am having difficulty understanding the difference, if there is one, between `roc_auc_score()` and `auc()` in scikit-learn. I am trying to predict a binary output with imbalanced classes (around 1.5% for Y=1). I have trained a logistic regression model and computed the roc curve. However, I am getting different results while calculating AUC using `auc(false_positive_rate, true_positive_rate)` (0.82338034042531527) and `roc_auc_score(Y_test, clf.predict(xtest))` (0.75944737191205602). Could someone explain this difference? I thought both were just calculating the area under the ROC curve. Could it be due to the imbalanced dataset?\n\nCode:\n```python\n# Classifier\nmodel_logit = LogisticRegression(class_weight='auto')\nmodel_logit.fit(X_train_ridge, Y_train)\n\n# Roc curve\nfalse_positive_rate, true_positive_rate, thresholds = roc_curve(Y_test, clf.predict_proba(xtest)[:,1])\n\n# AUC's\nprint(auc(false_positive_rate, true_positive_rate))  # Output: 0.82338034042531527\nprint(roc_auc_score(Y_test, clf.predict(xtest)))  # Output: 0.75944737191205602\n```"

        "content": "The discrepancy you're observing between `auc()` and `roc_auc_score()` is likely due to the difference in how these functions are being used in your code. Here's a breakdown of the differences:\n\n1. **`roc_auc_score()`**:\n   - This function expects the true labels and either the predicted probabilities or decision function scores for the positive class, not the predicted class labels.\n   - In your code, you're using `clf.predict(xtest)`, which provides the predicted class labels (0 or 1). Instead, you should use `clf.predict_proba(xtest)[:,1]`, which gives you the probabilities for the positive class.\n\n2. **`auc()`**:\n   - This function calculates the area under the curve given the false positive rates (FPR) and true positive rates (TPR) that you obtain from `roc_curve()`.\n   - You are using `roc_curve()` correctly by passing the predicted probabilities from `clf.predict_proba(xtest)[:,1]`.\n\n### Corrected Code\n\nTo make sure both functions are used consistently, you should update your `roc_auc_score()` call to use the probabilities instead of the predicted class labels:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, auc, roc_auc_score\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n\n# Classifier\nmodel_logit = LogisticRegression(class_weight='auto')\nmodel_logit.fit(X_train_ridge, Y_train)\n\n# Roc curve\nfalse_positive_rate, true_positive_rate, thresholds = roc_curve(Y_test, clf.predict_proba(xtest)[:,1])\n\n# AUC's\nprint(auc(false_positive_rate, true_positive_rate))  # Output: 0.82338034042531527\nprint(roc_auc_score(Y_test, clf.predict_proba(xtest)[:,1]))  # Should give output similar to 0.82338034042531527\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Imbalanced Dataset**: The class imbalance could affect the model's performance but not the calculation of AUC itself. AUC is generally robust to class imbalance because it measures the ability of the model to rank positive instances higher than negative ones.\n\n- **`class_weight='auto'`**: The `class_weight` parameter is used to handle class imbalance by adjusting the weights of classes inversely proportional to class frequencies. Note that in recent versions of scikit-learn, you should use `class_weight='balanced'` instead of `'auto'`.\n\nBy ensuring that you use probabilities rather than class predictions, your AUC scores calculated using `roc_auc_score()` and `auc()` should align more closely."
