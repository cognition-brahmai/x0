However, I am facing an issue where only the last processed image is displayed, effectively overwriting the other images. My code is as follows:\n\n```python\nfor file in images:\n    process(file)\n\ndef process(filename):\n    image = mpimg.imread(filename)\n    # something gets done here\n    plt.imshow(image)\n```\n\nHow can I modify this code to display all images instead of just the last one?"

        "content": "To display multiple images using `matplotlib`, you need to call `plt.show()` after plotting the images to render them. Additionally, you should create a new figure for each image to ensure they aren't overwritten. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.image as mpimg\n\ndef process(filename):\n    image = mpimg.imread(filename)\n    # something gets done here\n    plt.figure()  # Create a new figure for each image\n    plt.imshow(image)\n    plt.axis('off')  # Optional: turn off axis\n    plt.show()  # Display the image\n\nfor file in images:\n    process(file)\n```\n\nIn this modified code, `plt.figure()` is called before `plt.imshow(image)` to ensure each image is plotted in its own figure. Calling `plt.show()` within the `process` function will display each image in sequence. This way, all images will be displayed separately rather than being overwritten by the subsequent ones."
