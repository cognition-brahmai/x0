The idea is to split the sentence into words, filter out the word \"seashore\", and then identify the eight-letter word that appears third from the end. Here's a code snippet that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\ndef find_third_eight_letter_word(sentence):\n    # Split the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n\n    # Filter out the word \"seashore\"\n    filtered_words = [word for word in words if word.lower() != \"seashore\"]\n\n    # Find eight-letter words\n    eight_letter_words = [word for word in filtered_words if len(word) == 8]\n\n    # Check if there are at least three eight-letter words\n    if len(eight_letter_words) >= 3:\n        # Return the third from the end\n        return eight_letter_words[-3]\n    else:\n        return None\n\nsentence = \"She sells seashells by the seashore\"\nresult = find_third_eight_letter_word(sentence)\n\nif result:\n    print(f\"The third eight-letter word from the end is: '{result}'\")\nelse:\n    print(\"There are not enough eight-letter words in the sentence.\")\n```\n\nThis script will output the third eight-letter word from the end, excluding \"seashore\". In this particular case, the function should return \"seashells\"."
