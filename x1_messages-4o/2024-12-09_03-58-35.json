When I attempt to run the script using the command \"C:\\Python34&gt;python.exe label/make_label.py\", it results in an error message: \"OSError: cannot load library libcairo.so.2: error 0x7e\". I have already added the PATH to GTK/bin in the environmental variable and renamed \"libcairo-2.dll\" in the GTK/bin folder to \"libcairo.so\". What could be the solution to this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to the inability of your Python script to find or load the appropriate Cairo library. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Correct Library Naming**: Rename `libcairo.so` back to `libcairo-2.dll`. On Windows systems, the library should remain a `.dll` file. Renaming it to a `.so` file, which is typically for Unix-like systems, can cause issues.\n\n2. **Verify GTK Installation**: Ensure that you have installed the correct version of the GTK library that matches your Python version. Sometimes, mismatches between 32-bit and 64-bit versions can cause issues. Make sure both GTK and Python are either 32-bit or 64-bit.\n\n3. **Check PATH Environment Variable**: Double-check that the path to the GTK `bin` directory is correctly added to your system's PATH environment variable. Also, ensure that there are no extra spaces or incorrect paths.\n\n4. **Install Pycairo**: If you haven't already, consider installing the `pycairo` library using pip. This library provides Python bindings for Cairo and can sometimes resolve issues with dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   pip install pycairo\n   ```\n\n5. **Dependency Walker**: Use a tool like Dependency Walker to see if there are missing dependencies for `libcairo-2.dll`. This tool can help identify other DLLs that might be missing from your system.\n\n6. **Reinstall GTK**: If the above steps don't work, try reinstalling GTK to ensure that all components are correctly installed and configured.\n\n7. **Use MSYS2**: Consider using MSYS2 to install GTK and Cairo on Windows. It's a package management system that can help manage dependencies more effectively:\n   ```bash\n   pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk3\n   pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cairo\n   ```\n\n8. **Alternative Python Environment**: If possible, try setting up your script in a different Python environment or virtual environment to see if the issue persists. Sometimes, a clean environment can resolve dependency conflicts.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the library loading error and successfully run your Python script."
