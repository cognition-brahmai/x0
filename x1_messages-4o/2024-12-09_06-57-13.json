Whenever I run the following code, `if challenge.datetime_start <= datetime.now() <= challenge.datetime_end:`, I get a `TypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes`. My Django model is structured as follows:\n\n```python\nclass Fundraising_Challenge(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    datetime_start = models.DateTimeField()\n    datetime_end = models.DateTimeField()\n```\nI have Django set up to use locale date and times, but I am unsure of the format Django uses for DateTimeField(). Is it naive or aware? And how can I make `datetime.now()` recognize locale datetime?"

        "content": "In Django, the `DateTimeField` can store both naive and aware datetimes, but by default, it stores naive datetimes unless you explicitly set it to be timezone-aware. The error you're encountering, `TypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes`, indicates a mismatch between the timezone awareness of the datetimes you're trying to compare.\n\n### Understanding Naive vs. Aware Datetimes:\n\n- **Naive datetime**: Does not contain timezone information.\n- **Aware datetime**: Contains timezone information and can be used to perform timezone-aware arithmetic.\n\n### How to Fix the Issue:\n\n1. **Ensure your Django settings are set up for timezone awareness**:\n   - In your `settings.py`, ensure `USE_TZ` is set to `True` to enable timezone support.\n\n     ```python\n     USE_TZ = True\n     ```\n\n2. **Use Django's timezone utilities**:\n   - Instead of using `datetime.now()`, use Django's `timezone.now()`, which respects the `USE_TZ` setting and returns an aware datetime if `USE_TZ` is `True`.\n\n     ```python\n     from django.utils import timezone\n\n     # Correct way to compare\n     if challenge.datetime_start <= timezone.now() <= challenge.datetime_end:\n         # Your logic here\n     ```\n\n3. **Ensure stored datetimes are aware**:\n   - When saving data into the model, make sure the datetime objects are aware. You can use `timezone.now()` when assigning datetime values to your model fields.\n\n4. **Convert naive datetimes to aware if needed**:\n   - If you have existing data that is naive, you can convert it to an aware datetime using Django\u2019s timezone utilities.\n\n     ```python\n     from django.utils import timezone\n\n     naive_datetime = datetime.datetime.now()  # this is just an example\n     aware_datetime = timezone.make_aware(naive_datetime, timezone.get_current_timezone())\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to handle datetime comparisons correctly, respecting the timezone settings in your Django application."
