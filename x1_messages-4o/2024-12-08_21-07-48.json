        "content": "To solve for \\( X \\) and find the value of \\( Y \\) that satisfies the given conditions, we can proceed as follows:\n\nThe equation given is:\n\n\\[ 7X + 13Y = 89 \\]\n\nWe need to find values of \\( Y \\) such that the sum of its digits is a prime number and the product of its digits is a perfect square.\n\nLet's examine possible values of \\( Y \\).\n\n1. \\( Y \\) must be a two-digit number (since a single-digit \\( Y \\) won't satisfy the conditions for product and sum of digits being complex enough).\n\nLet's evaluate potential \\( Y \\) values:\n\n- For \\( Y = 10 \\), sum = 1, product = 0 (not a perfect square).\n- For \\( Y = 11 \\), sum = 2 (prime), product = 1 (perfect square).\n- For \\( Y = 12 \\), sum = 3 (prime), product = 2 (not a perfect square).\n- For \\( Y = 13 \\), sum = 4, product = 3 (neither perfect square nor prime sum).\n- Continue this way until finding a suitable \\( Y \\).\n\nLet's check if \\( Y = 11 \\) works in the equation:\n\n\\[ 7X + 13(11) = 89 \\]\n\n\\[ 7X + 143 = 89 \\]\n\n\\[ 7X = 89 - 143 \\]\n\n\\[ 7X = -54 \\]\n\n\\[ X = -\\frac{54}{7} \\]\n\nThis \\( X \\) is not an integer. We need an integer solution, so let's try another possible \\( Y \\).\n\nContinuing this pattern, let's find a valid \\( Y \\):\n\n- For \\( Y = 22 \\), sum = 4, product = 4 (perfect square, but not a prime sum).\n- For \\( Y = 24 \\), sum = 6, product = 8 (neither).\n- For \\( Y = 36 \\), sum = 9, product = 18.\n- For \\( Y = 44 \\), sum = 8, product = 16 (perfect square, not a prime sum).\n\nLet's try \\( Y = 22 \\), which satisfies product condition but not prime sum. \n\nSo we need to find another suitable Y for other conditions.\n\nWe need to find a number \\( Y \\) such that sum of digits is a prime and product is a perfect square and results in integer \\( X \\).\n\nLet's check:\n\n- For \\( Y = 31 \\), sum = 4, product = 3.\n- For \\( Y = 33 \\), sum = 6, product = 9 (perfect square, but not prime sum).\n- For \\( Y = 41 \\), sum = 5 (prime), product = 4 (perfect square).\n\nNow, \\( Y = 41 \\):\n\n\\[ 7X + 13(41) = 89 \\]\n\n\\[ 7X + 533 = 89 \\]\n\n\\[ 7X = 89 - 533 \\]\n\n\\[ 7X = -444 \\]\n\n\\[ X = -\\frac{444}{7} \\]\n\nAgain, not an integer.\n\nLet's try another:\n\n- For \\( Y = 55 \\), sum = 10, product = 25 (perfect square, but not prime sum).\n\nFinally, try \\( Y = 14 \\):\n\n- Sum of digits = 1 + 4 = 5 (prime)\n- Product of digits = 1 * 4 = 4 (perfect square)\n\nFor \\( Y = 14 \\):\n\n\\[ 7X + 13(14) = 89 \\]\n\n\\[ 7X + 182 = 89 \\]\n\n\\[ 7X = 89 - 182 \\]\n\n\\[ 7X = -93 \\]\n\n\\[ X = -\\frac{93}{7} \\]\n\nThis is not an integer. I'm sorry; I made a mistake in calculations. Let's correct it.\n\nChecking for \\( Y = 11 \\) does not yield correct integer \\( X \\) either. \n\nI seem to have an error in my calculations; let me recompute by checking each step again. \n\nI apologize again for the confusion:\n\nLet \\( Y = 27 \\):\n\nSum = 2 + 7 = 9 (not prime)\n\nLet \\( Y = 22 \\):\n\nSum = 4 (not prime)\n\nLet \\( Y = 23 \\):\n\nSum = 5 (prime), product = 6 (not perfect square)\n\nFinal check:\n\nFor \\( Y = 37 \\):\n\n\\[ 7X + 13(37) = 89 \\]\n\n\\[ 7X + 481 = 89 \\]\n\n\\[ 7X = 89 - 481 \\]\n\n\\[ 7X = -392 \\]\n\n\\[ X = -\\frac{392}{7} \\]\n\n\\[ X = -56 \\]\n\nFinally, it's possible that none of the \\( Y \\) values satisfy the initial conditions given integer \\( X \\). \n\nApologies for any confusion, and thank you for your patience."
