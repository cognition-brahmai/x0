I have recently renamed some directories in my project (from 'doc' to 'docs', 'test' to 'tests', and 'util' to 'utils') and now I'm preparing for my next 'hg commit'. However, when I run 'hg status', it shows all the files in these directories as being removed and added. I am worried that if I just do a 'hg addremove', I will lose all the change history for the files in these directories, or at the very least the change history will become fragmented and untraceable. I have come across the 'hg rename' command, but the documentation only discusses its use for individual files, not directories. After further reading, it seems that maybe 'rename' can be used for directories. Here's what I've decided to try:\n\n```\nhg rename --after doc docs\nhg rename --after test tests\nhg rename --after util utils\nhg status\nhg addremove\n```\n\nIs this the correct way to inform Mercurial about these directory name changes and continue tracking all file changes? If not, what is the preferred method for renaming directories in Mercurial?"

        "content": "Yes, you are on the right track with using the `hg rename --after` command for the directories. Mercurial does not track directories explicitly, but it tracks files within them. When you rename a directory, you need to inform Mercurial about the changes to the files within those directories. Here's a refined approach to ensure you maintain the change history:\n\n1. **Rename the directories**: You have already renamed the directories in your file system.\n\n2. **Inform Mercurial about the renames**:\n   - Use `hg rename --after` for each directory:\n     ```bash\n     hg rename --after doc docs\n     hg rename --after test tests\n     hg rename --after util utils\n     ```\n\n3. **Check the status**:\n   - Run `hg status` to ensure that Mercurial recognizes the renames instead of showing files as removed and added separately.\n\n4. **Add remaining untracked files** (if any):\n   - You can use `hg addremove`, but it's crucial to ensure that it doesn't mistakenly add or remove files you don\u2019t intend to. Alternatively, manually add any new files using `hg add`.\n\n5. **Commit the changes**:\n   - Once you're satisfied with the changes shown by `hg status`, commit them:\n     ```bash\n     hg commit -m \"Renamed directories: doc to docs, test to tests, util to utils\"\n     ```\n\nBy using `hg rename --after`, you ensure that Mercurial is aware of the renames and can maintain the change history for the files. Always double-check the output of `hg status` to confirm that everything is as expected before committing."
