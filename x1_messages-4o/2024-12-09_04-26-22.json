        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that the `input` object is not being found within the third cell (`cells[2]`). This typically happens when the structure isn't as expected, or the `input` element isn't present. Here's how you can modify your code to safely access the `input` value:\n\n1. Ensure that the `input` element is present before trying to access it.\n2. Use `find` to locate the `input` tag within the cell.\n\nHere's an updated version of your code:\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n# Assuming 'response' is your HTML response content\ntable = BeautifulSoup(response, 'html.parser').find(id=\"sometable\")  # Make soup and specify the parser.\n\n# Iterate through each row, skipping the header if needed.\nfor row in table.find_all(\"tr\")[1:]:\n    cells = row.find_all(\"td\")  # Find cells.\n\n    # Extract text and convert to integers\n    points = int(cells[0].get_text())\n    gold = int(cells[1].get_text())\n    \n    # Find the input tag within the third cell\n    input_tag = cells[2].find(\"input\")\n    \n    # Check if the input tag is found and has the 'value' attribute\n    if input_tag and 'value' in input_tag.attrs:\n        input_value = input_tag['value']\n        print(input_value)\n    else:\n        print(\"Input tag with 'value' not found in this row.\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- Use `BeautifulSoup(response, 'html.parser')` to ensure you're specifying the parser.\n- Use `find` to locate the `input` element. This returns `None` if the element isn't found, which prevents the `TypeError`.\n- Check if the `input` tag is found and has the `value` attribute before trying to access it.\n\nThis should handle situations where the `input` element might not be present or doesn't have a `value` attribute, preventing the `TypeError`."
