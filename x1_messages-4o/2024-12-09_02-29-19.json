I've attempted to understand the concept through Python tutorials, but I'm having difficulty figuring it out. How can I implement this?"

        "content": "Certainly! Linear interpolation is a method to estimate values between two known values. In the context of your lists `x` and `y`, you want to estimate `y` values for any `x` value that lies between the known `x` values using linear interpolation.\n\nHere's a Python function that performs linear interpolation between the given points in `x` and `y`:\n\n```python\ndef linear_interpolation(x, y, x_new):\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform linear interpolation to estimate y values for new x values.\n\n    :param x: List of known x values.\n    :param y: List of known y values corresponding to the x values.\n    :param x_new: A new x value (or list of x values) for which we want to estimate y.\n    :return: Estimated y value(s) corresponding to x_new.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure x_new is a list for consistency\n    if not isinstance(x_new, list):\n        x_new = [x_new]\n\n    y_new = []\n\n    for xn in x_new:\n        # Find the interval [x[i], x[i+1]] that contains xn\n        for i in range(len(x) - 1):\n            if x[i] <= xn <= x[i + 1]:\n                # Calculate the slope (m) of the line between the points\n                m = (y[i + 1] - y[i]) / (x[i + 1] - x[i])\n                # Calculate the y value at xn using the line equation y = mx + c\n                yn = y[i] + m * (xn - x[i])\n                y_new.append(yn)\n                break\n        else:\n            # If xn is outside the range of x, you can choose to handle it as needed\n            # For now, we'll append None to indicate out of bounds\n            y_new.append(None)\n\n    return y_new\n\n# Example usage\nx = [1, 2.5, 3.4, 5.8, 6]\ny = [2, 4, 5.8, 4.3, 4]\n\nx_new = [1.5, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0]\ny_estimated = linear_interpolation(x, y, x_new)\n\nprint(\"Estimated y values for x_new:\", y_estimated)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `linear_interpolation` takes three arguments: `x`, `y`, and `x_new`.\n2. **Iterate Over New x Values**: For each new `x` value (`x_new`), the function finds the interval `[x[i], x[i+1]]` that contains the new `x` value.\n3. **Calculate Slope**: The slope `m` of the line connecting two known points is calculated as `(y[i+1] - y[i]) / (x[i+1] - x[i])`.\n4. **Interpolate**: Using the line equation \\( y = mx + c \\), where \\( c \\) is the intercept, we estimate the `y` value at `x_new`.\n5. **Handling Out of Bounds**: If `x_new` is outside the range of `x`, it returns `None` for that value.\n\nYou can modify the way out-of-bound values are handled depending on your specific needs."
