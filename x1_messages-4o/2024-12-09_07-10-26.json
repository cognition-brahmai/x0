I'm currently using Python 2.7.5 and the code I have written so far is:\n\n```python\nimport os, zipfile\n\nfolder = 'D:/GISData/LiDAR/SomeFolder'\nextension = \".zip\"\n\nfor item in os.listdir(folder):\n    if item.endswith(extension):\n        zipfile.ZipFile.extract(item)\n```\nHowever, when I run this script, I receive an error:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"D:/GISData/Tools/MO_Tools/BatchUnzip.py\", line 10, in <module>\n    extract = zipfile.ZipFile.extract(item)\nTypeError: unbound method extract() must be called with ZipFile instance as first argument (got str instance instead)\n```\nI've tried to implement a suggestion, but it just leads to another error:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"D:/GISData/Tools/MO_Tools/BatchUnzip.py\", line 12, in <module>\n    zipfile.ZipFile(item).extract()\n  File \"C:\\Python27\\ArcGIS10.2\\lib\\zipfile.py\", line 752, in __init__\n    self.fp = open(file, modeDict[mode])\nIOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'JeffCity_0752.las.zip'\n```\n\nI've checked that the files are present using print statements. Can anyone suggest what I might be doing wrong?"

        "content": "The issues you're encountering are related to the way you're handling file paths and the usage of the `zipfile` module. Let's address these step by step.\n\n1. **Ensure Full Path is Used**: When working with files, it's important to provide the full path to the file, not just the file name. This means combining the directory path with the file name.\n\n2. **Correct Usage of `zipfile.ZipFile`**: You need to open the zip file using `zipfile.ZipFile` and then extract its contents.\n\nHere's a corrected version of your script:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport zipfile\n\nfolder = 'D:/GISData/LiDAR/SomeFolder'\nextension = \".zip\"\n\nfor item in os.listdir(folder):\n    if item.endswith(extension):\n        full_path = os.path.join(folder, item)  # Combine folder path with file name\n        with zipfile.ZipFile(full_path, 'r') as zip_ref:  # Open the zip file\n            zip_ref.extractall(folder)  # Extract all contents into the same folder\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **`os.path.join(folder, item)`**: This creates the full path to the zip file by combining the folder path and the file name.\n  \n- **`with zipfile.ZipFile(full_path, 'r') as zip_ref:`**: This line opens the zip file for reading and ensures it is properly closed after extraction by using the `with` statement.\n\n- **`zip_ref.extractall(folder)`**: This extracts all files in the zip archive to the specified folder.\n\nBy following these steps, the script should correctly extract all `.zip` files in the specified folder into the same folder. Remember to check the folder paths for any typos or errors to ensure the script can find the files."
