However, instead of an error, the REPL returns `[15]`. Can someone explain why this is happening and what is the logic behind this?"

It seems you intended to create a list comprehension, but the syntax isn't quite correct for that purpose.\n\nHere's what's happening:\n\n1. `0x` is being interpreted as a hexadecimal number literal in Python. In Python, the prefix `0x` denotes a hexadecimal number. So `0xf` is the hexadecimal representation of the decimal number `15`.\n\n2. The `for` statement following the hexadecimal `0x` is actually ignored in this context, as it doesn't form a valid list comprehension due to the syntax error.\n\n3. The REPL interprets the first part `0xf` and returns `[15]` because it's treating `[0xf]` as a list containing a single element, which is the decimal equivalent of the hexadecimal number `0xf`.\n\nIf you're aiming to create a list comprehension, you'd need to use a valid expression before the `for` keyword. For example, if you want to multiply each element by `15`, you can write:\n```python\n[15*x for x in (1, 2, 3)]\n```\n\nThis will yield `[15, 30, 45]`, multiplying each element of the tuple `(1, 2, 3)` by `15`."
