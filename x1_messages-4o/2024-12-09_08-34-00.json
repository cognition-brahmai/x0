Specifically, I'd like to multiply both a 1D and 2D array with a scalar. For example, if I have: \n\n```python\na_1 = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\na_2 = np.array([[1., 2.], [3., 4.]])\nb = 2.0  \n```\n\nI'm trying to achieve the following results:\n\n```python\na_1 * b = array([2.0, 4.0, 6.0])\na_2 * b = array([[2., 4.], [6., 8.]])\n```\n\nIs there a way to do this?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this using NumPy's universal functions (ufuncs), but in your specific case, you don't really need to use ufuncs explicitly to multiply a NumPy array by a scalar. NumPy's basic array operations already support element-wise operations with scalars out of the box.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define your arrays\na_1 = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\na_2 = np.array([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])\nb = 2.0\n\n# Multiply the arrays by the scalar\nresult_1 = a_1 * b\nresult_2 = a_2 * b\n\nprint(\"a_1 * b =\", result_1)\nprint(\"a_2 * b =\", result_2)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\na_1 * b = [2. 4. 6.]\na_2 * b = [[2. 4.]\n           [6. 8.]]\n```\n\nIn this example, the multiplication operation `*` is a shorthand for calling the `np.multiply` ufunc, which performs element-wise multiplication. NumPy automatically broadcasts the scalar `b` to each element of the arrays `a_1` and `a_2`, resulting in the desired multiplication.\n\nIf you want to explicitly use the `np.multiply` ufunc for clarity or educational purposes, you can do so like this:\n\n```python\nresult_1 = np.multiply(a_1, b)\nresult_2 = np.multiply(a_2, b)\n```\n\nBoth approaches will give you the same result."
