The expected output is:\n\n```\narea      cnt    party1    party2     sheet\nbacon     9         5         5        sh1\nspam      3         7         5        sh1\neggs      2         18        4        sh2\n```\n\nI am reading in the file with `book = pd.ExcelFile(path)`. I am wondering if I need to use a loop to parse each sheet and rename the variables. Can you help me with the correct approach and the code to achieve this?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this by iterating over each sheet in your Excel file, processing the data to rename the columns, and then combining the results into a single DataFrame. Below is a step-by-step approach with the corresponding Python code using `pandas`:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the Excel file\npath = 'foo.xlsx'\nbook = pd.ExcelFile(path)\n\n# Initialize an empty DataFrame to store the combined data\ncombined_df = pd.DataFrame()\n\n# Iterate through each sheet\nfor sheet_name in book.sheet_names:\n    # Read the data from the current sheet\n    df = book.parse(sheet_name)\n    \n    # Rename columns by removing the part before '\\n'\n    new_columns = []\n    for col in df.columns:\n        if '\\n' in col:\n            new_col = col.split('\\n')[1]  # Keep only the part after '\\n'\n        else:\n            new_col = col  # Keep column name as it is\n        new_columns.append(new_col)\n    \n    # Update the DataFrame with the new column names\n    df.columns = new_columns\n    \n    # Add a new column for the sheet name\n    df['sheet'] = sheet_name\n    \n    # Append the processed DataFrame to the combined DataFrame\n    combined_df = pd.concat([combined_df, df], ignore_index=True)\n\n# Output the combined DataFrame\nprint(combined_df)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Load the Excel File:** Use `pd.ExcelFile(path)` to read the Excel file.\n2. **Initialize an Empty DataFrame:** `combined_df` will be used to store all the processed data from each sheet.\n3. **Iterate Over Each Sheet:** Use a loop to process each sheet.\n4. **Read and Process Each Sheet:**\n   - Use `book.parse(sheet_name)` to read the data from the current sheet.\n   - For each column, check if it contains `\\n` and split it to get the part after `\\n` for renaming.\n5. **Add Sheet Name:** Add a new column `sheet` to each DataFrame to keep track of the original sheet.\n6. **Combine Data:** Use `pd.concat()` to append each processed sheet's DataFrame to the `combined_df`.\n7. **Print the Result:** Output the combined DataFrame.\n\nThis code will iterate over each sheet, rename the columns as specified, and combine all the data into a single DataFrame."
