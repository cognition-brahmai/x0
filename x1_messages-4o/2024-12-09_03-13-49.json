When I run an IPython interpreter within the Project/ directory with an empty __init__.py file, the following code works:\n\n```\nfrom Animals.Mammals import Mammals\nx = Mammals()\nx.printMammals()\n```\n\nHowever, I would like to be able to write `from Animals import Mammals` instead of `from Animals.Mammals import Mammals`. I believe that to achieve this, I need to modify my __init__.py file as follows:\n\n```\nfrom Mammals import Mammals\nfrom Birds import Birds\n```\n\nNonetheless, when I make this change and run the code `from Animals import Mammals` from within a similar Project/ sourced IPython interpreter, I receive an ImportError:\n\n```\nIn [1]: from Animals import Mammals\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nImportError                               Traceback (most recent call last)\n<ipython-input-1-6d651848af9b> in <module>()\n----> 1 from Animals import Mammals\n\n/Users/username/Project/Animals/__init__.py in <module>()\n----> 1 from Mammals import Mammals\n      2 from Birds import Birds\n\nImportError: No module named 'Mammals'\n```\n\nWhy am I receiving this error and how can I fix it?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the relative import syntax used in your `__init__.py` file. When you perform `from Mammals import Mammals` and `from Birds import Birds`, Python is looking for `Mammals.py` and `Birds.py` as top-level modules, not as submodules of the `Animals` package. \n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to use relative imports in your `__init__.py` file. Here's how you can modify it:\n\n```python\nfrom .Mammals import Mammals\nfrom .Birds import Birds\n```\n\nBy using the dot (`.`), you're telling Python to look for the `Mammals` and `Birds` modules within the current package (i.e., the `Animals` package). \n\nAfter making this change, you should be able to import `Mammals` and `Birds` using the following syntax:\n\n```python\nfrom Animals import Mammals\nx = Mammals()\nx.printMammals()\n```\n\nThis approach keeps your project structure clean and allows for easy importation of classes defined in your submodules."
