I understand that I can't use the 'print' command like in regular Python IDLE, but I am unsure of what to use instead. My current code does not display any text when run in the pygame window, but it does show in IDLE. Is there a way to display the text I type in the pygame window? Here is the beginning part of my program:\n\n```python\nimport pygame, sys\nfrom pygame.locals import *\n\nBLACK = ( 0, 0, 0)\nWHITE = (255, 255, 255)\nGREEN = (0, 255, 0)\nRED = ( 255, 0, 0)\n\npygame.init()\nsize = (700, 500)\nscreen = pygame.display.set_mode(size)\n\nDISPLAYSURF = pygame.display.set_mode((400, 300))\npygame.display.set_caption('P.Earth')\nwhile 1: # main game loop\n    for event in pygame.event.get():\n        if event.type == QUIT:           \n            pygame.display.update() \n\nimport time\n\ndirection = ''\nprint('Welcome to Earth')\npygame.draw.rect(screen, RED, [55,500,10,5], 0)\ntime.sleep(1)\n```"

        "content": "To display text in a Pygame window, you need to use Pygame's `font` module to render the text as an image and then blit that image onto the screen. Below is an example of how you can modify your program to display text:\n\n```python\nimport pygame, sys\nfrom pygame.locals import *\n\n# Initialize Pygame\npygame.init()\n\n# Define colors\nBLACK = (0, 0, 0)\nWHITE = (255, 255, 255)\nGREEN = (0, 255, 0)\nRED = (255, 0, 0)\n\n# Set up the display\nsize = (700, 500)\nscreen = pygame.display.set_mode(size)\npygame.display.set_caption('P.Earth')\n\n# Define font and size\nfont = pygame.font.Font(None, 36)\n\n# Render the text\ntext = font.render('Welcome to Earth', True, WHITE)\n\n# Main game loop\nwhile True:\n    for event in pygame.event.get():\n        if event.type == QUIT:\n            pygame.quit()\n            sys.exit()\n    \n    # Fill the screen with a color\n    screen.fill(BLACK)\n    \n    # Draw a rectangle\n    pygame.draw.rect(screen, RED, [55, 50, 10, 5], 0)\n\n    # Blit the text onto the screen\n    screen.blit(text, (50, 50))\n\n    # Update the display\n    pygame.display.update()\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what was added or changed:\n\n1. **Font Initialization:** The `pygame.font.Font` is used to create a font object. You can specify the font type and size. `None` defaults to the built-in font, and `36` is the font size.\n\n2. **Text Rendering:** The `render` method of the font object is used to create a surface with the text rendered onto it. The parameters are the text string, anti-aliasing (True for smoother edges), and the color of the text.\n\n3. **Blitting Text:** The `blit` method is used to draw the text surface onto the main screen surface at a specified position.\n\n4. **Screen Update:** Make sure `pygame.display.update()` is called to refresh the display and show the changes.\n\n5. **Drawing the Rectangle Correctly:** The rectangle coordinates were adjusted to be visible on the screen (`[55, 50, 10, 5]` instead of `[55, 500, 10, 5]`).\n\nMake sure you have Pygame installed and that the rest of your code logic aligns with your game's requirements. Adjust positions and other parameters as necessary to fit your design."
