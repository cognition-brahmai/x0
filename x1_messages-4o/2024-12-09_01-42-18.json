        "content": "To handle Unix signals like SIGINT (which is typically sent when you press Ctrl+C) in a PyQt application, you need to integrate Python's signal handling with the Qt event loop. By default, PyQt applications may not handle these signals properly because the Qt event loop takes over and can block them.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to handle SIGINT in your PyQt application:\n\n1. **Use the `signal` module**: This module provides mechanisms to handle signals in Python.\n\n2. **Create a custom handler**: Define a function to handle the signal. This function should gracefully terminate your application.\n\n3. **Connect the signal to the handler**: You can use the `signal.signal()` function to connect the SIGINT signal to your custom handler.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement this in your PyQt application:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport signal\nfrom PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow, QPushButton\n\nclass MainWindow(QMainWindow):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.setWindowTitle(\"PyQt Signal Handling Example\")\n        self.setGeometry(300, 300, 400, 200)\n\n        button = QPushButton(\"Quit\", self)\n        button.clicked.connect(self.close)\n        button.resize(button.sizeHint())\n        button.move(150, 80)\n\ndef handle_sigint(signum, frame):\n    print(\"SIGINT received. Exiting gracefully...\")\n    QApplication.quit()\n\ndef main():\n    # Create a PyQt application\n    app = QApplication(sys.argv)\n\n    # Create the main window\n    window = MainWindow()\n    window.show()\n\n    # Connect the SIGINT signal to the handler\n    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, handle_sigint)\n\n    # Start the event loop\n    sys.exit(app.exec_())\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Signal Handling**: The `handle_sigint()` function will be called when a SIGINT signal is received (e.g., when you press Ctrl+C in the console).\n- **QApplication.quit()**: This method is called to ensure that the application exits gracefully.\n- **Event Loop**: Ensure that `sys.exit(app.exec_())` is used to start the Qt event loop.\n\nThis setup should ensure that your PyQt application listens for SIGINT signals and terminates appropriately when they are received."
