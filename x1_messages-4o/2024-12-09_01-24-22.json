This warning occurs when I use my user-defined exception class which is defined as follows:\n\n```python\nclass MyException(Exception):\n\n    def __init__(self, message):\n        self.message = message\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return repr(self.message)\n```\nThe exact warning message I receive is:\n\n```shell\nDeprecationWarning: BaseException.message has been deprecated as of Python 2.6\nself.message = message\n```\nWhat is the issue with my code? How can I modify my code to avoid this deprecation warning?"

        "content": "The warning you're encountering is due to the fact that in Python 2.6, the `BaseException.message` attribute has been deprecated. This means that using `self.message` to store the exception message in a custom exception class is no longer recommended because it conflicts with the internal `message` attribute of `BaseException`.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you should use a different attribute name in your custom exception class to store the message. Here's how you can modify your code to avoid the deprecation warning:\n\n```python\nclass MyException(Exception):\n\n    def __init__(self, message):\n        self.custom_message = message\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return repr(self.custom_message)\n```\n\nIn this revised version, I've changed the attribute name from `message` to `custom_message`. This avoids the conflict with the deprecated `BaseException.message` and eliminates the warning.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that in more recent versions of Python (Python 3.x), you can simply pass the message to the `Exception` class constructor and rely on its built-in `__str__` method, like this:\n\n```python\nclass MyException(Exception):\n    pass\n\n# Usage\ntry:\n    raise MyException(\"An error occurred\")\nexcept MyException as e:\n    print(e)\n```\n\nHowever, if you need to customize the `__str__` method or store additional data, using a different attribute name as shown in the first solution is appropriate."
