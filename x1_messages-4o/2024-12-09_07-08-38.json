        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the way you're attempting to delete records using SQLAlchemy. The `session.delete()` method is designed to delete individual instances of mapped classes (i.e., objects), not to delete records based on a condition directly.\n\nTo delete all records that match a certain condition, you should use the `Query` object along with the `filter()` method to specify the condition, and then call the `delete()` method on the query. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.automap import automap_base\n\nengine = create_engine(string)\nmeta = MetaData(bind=engine)\nmeta.reflect(bind=engine, schema='myschema')\n\nBase = automap_base(metadata=meta)\nBase.prepare(engine, reflect=True)\nClasses = Base.classes\n\nSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\nsession = Session()\n\n# Assuming 'plays' is the mapped class you want to delete records from\nplays = Classes.plays  # Replace 'plays' with the actual class name\n\n# Use query to filter and delete records\nsession.query(plays).filter(plays.record_id == '123').delete(synchronize_session=False)\n\n# Commit the transaction to persist the changes\nsession.commit()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Query with Filter**: Use `session.query()` with `.filter()` to specify which records you want to delete.\n2. **Delete**: Call `.delete()` on the query object to delete the matching records.\n3. **synchronize_session**: The `synchronize_session=False` argument is used for performance reasons\u2014if you don't need to synchronize the session state with the database changes, it's faster to disable this.\n4. **Commit**: Don't forget to commit the transaction to make the changes permanent in the database.\n\nMake sure to replace `'plays'` with the actual class name you want to delete records from if it's different."
