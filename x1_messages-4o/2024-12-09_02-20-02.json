I've found solutions on how to write a list to a file, however, those solutions are applicable for flat lists. How can I do it for a list of dictionaries?"

        "content": "To save a list of dictionaries to a file and later retrieve it, you can use the `json` module in Python. This module provides easy-to-use functions for converting Python objects to JSON format and vice versa. JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy to read and write for humans and machines.\n\nHere's how you can save your list of dictionaries to a file and then load it back when needed:\n\n### Saving to a File\n\n1. **Convert the list of dictionaries to JSON format** using `json.dump()` or `json.dumps()`:\n   - `json.dump()` is used to write JSON data directly to a file.\n   - `json.dumps()` is used to convert Python objects to a JSON string, which you can then write to a file.\n\n2. **Write the JSON data to a file**.\n\n```python\nimport json\n\nlogic_steps = [\n    {\n        'pattern': \"asdfghjkl\",\n        'message': \"This is not possible\"\n    },\n    {\n        'pattern': \"anotherpatterntomatch\",\n        'message': \"The parameter provided application is invalid\"\n    },\n    {\n        'pattern': \"athirdpatterntomatch\",\n        'message': \"Expected value for debugging\"\n    },\n]\n\n# Save the list of dictionaries to a JSON file\nwith open('logic_steps.json', 'w') as file:\n    json.dump(logic_steps, file, indent=4)\n```\n\n- The `indent` parameter is optional but makes the JSON file more readable by adding indentation.\n\n### Loading from a File\n\n1. **Read the JSON data from the file** using `json.load()` or `json.loads()`:\n   - `json.load()` is used to read JSON data from a file.\n   - `json.loads()` is used to parse a JSON string.\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Load the list of dictionaries from the JSON file\nwith open('logic_steps.json', 'r') as file:\n    loaded_logic_steps = json.load(file)\n\nprint(loaded_logic_steps)\n```\n\n- This will load the data back into a Python list of dictionaries, which you can use in your script.\n\nBy saving and loading in this manner, you ensure that any changes you make to the `logic_steps` list are preserved across script restarts."
