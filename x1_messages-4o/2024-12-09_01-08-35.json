I am using Django 1.6 and have set my `settings.py` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport os\nBASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__))\n\n# ...\n\nLANGUAGE_CODE = 'nl'\nUSE_I18N = True\nUSE_L10N = True\nLOCALE_PATHS = (os.path.join(BASE_DIR, \"locale\"),)\n```\n\nI have made a copy of `django/contrib/admin/locale/nl/LC_MESSAGES/django.po` and placed it into `my_project/locale/nl/LC_MESSAGES/django.po` with some modifications. Then I ran `python manage.py compilemessages` and `python manage.py runserver`. Unfortunately, when I navigate to `localhost:8000/admin`, I'm still seeing Django's default admin translations. What could be the issue here?"

        "content": "Overriding the default translations in Django's admin site can be a bit tricky, especially with older versions like Django 1.6. Here are a few things you can check and try to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Correct File Structure**:\n    - Make sure your directory structure is correct. The `.po` file should be located at: `my_project/locale/nl/LC_MESSAGES/django.po`.\n    - Verify that the `BASE_DIR` and `LOCALE_PATHS` settings are correctly pointing to the directory where your custom translations are stored.\n\n2. **Check the Compilation of Messages**:\n    - After modifying the `.po` file, you need to run `python manage.py compilemessages` to compile the `.po` files into `.mo` files. Make sure this command completes successfully without errors.\n    - Check if the corresponding `.mo` file (`django.mo`) is created in the `locale/nl/LC_MESSAGES` directory.\n\n3. **Clear Django's Cache**:\n    - Sometimes, Django might cache translations. Try restarting the server or clearing the cache to ensure that your changes are picked up.\n\n4. **Check File Permissions**:\n    - Ensure that the `.po` and `.mo` files have the correct permissions for Django to read them.\n\n5. **Check the Order of `LOCALE_PATHS`**:\n    - Django uses the first translation it finds. Make sure your custom translation path is listed before any other paths that might contain the default translations.\n\n6. **Language Settings**:\n    - Double-check that `LANGUAGE_CODE` is set to `'nl'` and that `USE_I18N` and `USE_L10N` are both set to `True`.\n\n7. **Django Version**:\n    - Since Django 1.6 is quite old, consider upgrading to a newer version if possible, as there have been significant improvements in internationalization and translation handling in newer versions.\n\n8. **Debugging**:\n    - Add some debug statements or use logging to verify which translation files are being loaded. This can give you a clue if the custom translations are being ignored.\n\nIf all else fails, double-check your modifications in the `.po` file to ensure there are no syntax errors or issues with the specific translations you've modified. If you follow these steps and verify each point, you should be able to override the default translations successfully."
