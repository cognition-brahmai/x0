        "content": "To create a Go program that performs a basic linear search of an array, you need to iterate over the elements of the array and compare each element with the target value. If the element matches the target value, you return its index; otherwise, you continue searching. If the target is not found, you can return a special value indicating that the target is absent (e.g., -1).\n\nHere's a simple example of a Go program that performs a linear search:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n)\n\n// linearSearch performs a linear search on the given array for the target value.\n// It returns the index of the target value if found, otherwise it returns -1.\nfunc linearSearch(arr []int, target int) int {\n    for i, v := range arr {\n        if v == target {\n            return i\n        }\n    }\n    return -1\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    arr := []int{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15}\n    target := 7\n\n    index := linearSearch(arr, target)\n\n    if index != -1 {\n        fmt.Printf(\"Target value %d found at index %d.\\n\", target, index)\n    } else {\n        fmt.Printf(\"Target value %d not found in the array.\\n\", target)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Function `linearSearch`:** This function takes an array and a target value as arguments. It iterates over the array using a `for` loop, comparing each element with the target value. If it finds a match, it returns the current index. If the loop completes without finding the target, it returns -1.\n  \n- **Main function:** In the `main` function, an array and a target value are defined. The `linearSearch` function is called with these values, and the result is printed to the console.\n\nThis program demonstrates a simple linear search algorithm in Go, which has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array."
