I tried to check the type of the user's input using the code below, but it didn't work because the 'input' function always returns a string.\n\n```python\nuser_input = input(\"Enter something:\")\n\nif type(user_input) == int:\n    print(\"Is a number\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Not a number\")\n```"

        "content": "To verify if a user's string input is a number, you need to convert the string to a number type (such as an integer or a float) and handle any exceptions that might arise if the conversion fails. You can use a try-except block to achieve this. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nuser_input = input(\"Enter something:\")\n\ntry:\n    # Try converting the input to an integer\n    number = int(user_input)\n    print(\"Is an integer\")\nexcept ValueError:\n    try:\n        # If it's not an integer, try converting it to a float\n        number = float(user_input)\n        print(\"Is a float\")\n    except ValueError:\n        # If both conversions fail, it's not a number\n        print(\"Not a number\")\n```\n\nThis code first attempts to convert the input to an integer. If that fails (raises a `ValueError`), it then tries to convert the input to a float. If both attempts fail, it prints \"Not a number\". This way, you can accurately determine if the user's input is a number and whether it's an integer or a float."
