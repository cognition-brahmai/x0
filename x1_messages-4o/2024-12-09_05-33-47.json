        "content": "The issue you're facing is related to how Python imports work. When you import a function or a module, Python executes the import statement and essentially creates a reference to the module or function in the current namespace. Once a function is imported directly (like `do_something_expensive` in your `bar` module), replacing the function in the original module doesn't affect the reference that has already been created in `bar.py`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of what's happening:\n\n1. In `bar.py`, you import `do_something_expensive` directly from `a_package.baz`. This creates a reference to the original function within the namespace of `bar.py`.\n\n2. When you call `a_function()` from another module, it uses the reference to `do_something_expensive` that was created when `bar.py` was first imported. Thus, any changes you make to `do_something_expensive` after the import don't affect the function within `bar.py`.\n\nTo fix this, you need to ensure that the `do_something_expensive` reference in `bar.py` is updated. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Import the entire module instead of just the function**: This approach allows you to modify the module's attributes and have those modifications reflected throughout the application.\n\n   Modify `bar.py`:\n\n   ```python\n   import a_package.baz\n\n   def a_function():\n       print(a_package.baz.do_something_expensive())\n   ```\n\n2. **Modify your patching script**: Ensure that you are modifying the function on the module level, not just within your script.\n\n   ```python\n   from bar import a_function\n   a_function()\n\n   import a_package.baz\n   a_package.baz.do_something_expensive = lambda: 'Something really cheap.'\n   a_function()\n   ```\n\nWith these changes, the output should be:\n\n```\nSomething expensive!\nSomething really cheap.\n```\n\nBy importing the whole module and accessing the function as `a_package.baz.do_something_expensive()`, you ensure that any modifications to `do_something_expensive` are reflected across all imports of the module."
