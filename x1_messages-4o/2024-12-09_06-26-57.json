I am using JSON to serialize the values of a queryset from my model 'Country', with the following code:\n\n```python\nimport json\nclass CountryListView(ListView):\n     model = Country\n\n    def render_to_response(self, context, **response_kwargs):\n         return json.dumps(self.get_queryset().values_list('code', flat=True))\n```\n\nHowever, when I try to execute this, I get an error message stating that my list is not JSON serializable:\n\n```python\n[u'ae', u'ag', u'ai', u'al', u'am', \nu'ao', u'ar', u'at', u'au', u'aw', \nu'az', u'ba', u'bb', u'bd', u'be', u'bg', \nu'bh', u'bl', u'bm', u'bn', '...(remaining elements truncated)...'] \nis not JSON serializable\n```\n\nCan anyone provide guidance on how to resolve this?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely due to the fact that the list of country codes is being returned as a list of Unicode strings, and the `json.dumps()` function might not handle the Unicode strings properly in this setting. However, Python's `json` module should be able to serialize Unicode strings, so the issue might be elsewhere in your setup.\n\nHere are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure the Correct Response Type**: Since you're using a `ListView`, it's typically expected to return an HTTP response. You should use Django's `JsonResponse` which handles JSON serialization and sets the correct content type.\n\n2. **Return a Proper HTTP Response**: Modify your `render_to_response` method to return a `JsonResponse` object from Django. This will properly handle the JSON serialization for you.\n\nHere's how you can adjust your code:\n\n```python\nfrom django.http import JsonResponse\nfrom django.views.generic import ListView\nfrom .models import Country\n\nclass CountryListView(ListView):\n    model = Country\n\n    def render_to_response(self, context, **response_kwargs):\n        # Convert the queryset to a list\n        country_codes = list(self.get_queryset().values_list('code', flat=True))\n        # Return JsonResponse\n        return JsonResponse(country_codes, safe=False)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **JsonResponse**: This is a subclass of `HttpResponse` that makes it easy to return JSON-encoded data. Setting `safe=False` allows the response to be a list rather than a dictionary.\n  \n- **Convert QuerySet to List**: Ensure the queryset is explicitly converted to a list before returning, which you are already doing. This makes it easier to serialize.\n\n### Additional Note:\n\n- If your Unicode strings (`u'...'`) are causing issues, check your Python version. Python 3 should handle Unicode strings without any special requirements, but if you're using Python 2, consider upgrading to Python 3 or explicitly encoding the strings to UTF-8. However, this is generally not necessary with Django's handling of querysets and responses.\n\nThis should resolve your JSON serialization issue."
