        "content": "To create a Python class that implements the iterable protocol, you need to define two special methods: `__iter__()` and `__next__()`. The `__iter__()` method returns the iterator object itself, and the `__next__()` method returns the next value from the iterator. When there are no more values to return, `__next__()` should raise a `StopIteration` exception.\n\nHere's a simple example of a Python class that implements the iterable protocol by iterating over a range of numbers:\n\n```python\nclass MyRange:\n    def __init__(self, start, end):\n        self.start = start\n        self.end = end\n        self.current = start\n\n    def __iter__(self):\n        # The __iter__ method should return the iterator object itself\n        return self\n\n    def __next__(self):\n        # The __next__ method should return the next item and raise StopIteration when done\n        if self.current < self.end:\n            number = self.current\n            self.current += 1\n            return number\n        else:\n            raise StopIteration\n\n# Usage example\nmy_range = MyRange(1, 5)\nfor number in my_range:\n    print(number)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `MyRange` class is initialized with a `start` and `end` value. The `__iter__()` method returns the instance itself (since it is its own iterator), and the `__next__()` method returns the next number in the range and updates the current value. Once the current value reaches the end, it raises a `StopIteration` exception to signal that the iteration is complete.\n\nWhen you create an instance of `MyRange` and use it in a `for` loop, Python calls the `__iter__()` method to get the iterator and then repeatedly calls the `__next__()` method to retrieve values until `StopIteration` is raised."
