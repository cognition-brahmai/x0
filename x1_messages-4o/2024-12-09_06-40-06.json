How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "In Python, you can override a class method at the instance level by directly assigning a new function to the method of the instance. This allows you to change the behavior of the method for that specific instance only, without affecting other instances of the same class. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nclass Dog:\n    def bark(self):\n        print(\"WOOF\")\n\nboby = Dog()\nboby.bark()  # Outputs: WOOF\n\n# Define a new method\ndef new_bark():\n    print(\"MEOW\")\n\n# Override the bark method for the boby instance\nboby.bark = new_bark\n\nboby.bark()  # Outputs: MEOW\n\n# Another instance of Dog\nrocky = Dog()\nrocky.bark()  # Outputs: WOOF\n```\n\nIn this example, the `bark` method of the `boby` instance is overridden by assigning the `new_bark` function to `boby.bark`. This change affects only the `boby` instance, leaving other instances of `Dog` unaltered."
