My DataFrame has close to 1000 columns, so I want to avoid doing this one column at a time. Here's an example DataFrame:\n\n```python\ndf1 = pd.DataFrame([(1,2,None),(None,4,None),(5,None,7),(5,None,None)], \n                    columns=['a','b','d'], index = ['A', 'B','C','D'])\n\n    a   b   d\nA   1   2 NaN\nB NaN   4 NaN\nC   5 NaN   7\nD   5 NaN NaN\n```\n\nI want the output to look as follows:\n\n```python\na: 3\nb: 2\nd: 1\n```\n\nIs there a concise way to achieve this?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this concisely using the `DataFrame.count()` method in pandas, which counts the number of non-NaN entries for each column in the DataFrame. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf1 = pd.DataFrame([(1, 2, None), (None, 4, None), (5, None, 7), (5, None, None)], \n                   columns=['a', 'b', 'd'], index=['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'])\n\nnon_nan_counts = df1.count()\n\nfor column, count in non_nan_counts.items():\n    print(f\"{column}: {count}\")\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, you'll get the desired output:\n\n```\na: 3\nb: 2\nd: 1\n```\n\nThe `count()` method provides a quick and efficient way to count non-NaN entries across all columns without having to manually iterate over each column."
