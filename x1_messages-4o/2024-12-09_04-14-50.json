After importing and running this function in IPython, I modified the function in the module to print \"test changed\". However, when I reimport the module and run the function, it still prints the old message \"test\". I tried deleting the module and reimporting it, but the result remains the same. I also deleted the `foo.pyc` file in the same folder as `foo.py` but it didn't help. How can I reimport the updated code at runtime?"

        "content": "When you're working in an IPython environment or Jupyter Notebook, importing a module doesn't automatically reload it if it has been modified. This is because Python caches imported modules, so the initial version of the module persists unless explicitly reloaded.\n\nTo reload a module after modifying it, you can use the `importlib` library which is specifically designed to handle module imports in Python. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. First, import your module as usual:\n\n   ```python\n   import foo\n   ```\n\n2. After modifying your `foo.py` file, use the `importlib.reload()` function to reload the module:\n\n   ```python\n   import importlib\n   importlib.reload(foo)\n   ```\n\n3. Now, when you call the function, it should reflect the changes:\n\n   ```python\n   foo.foo()\n   ```\n\nThis process should update the module in your current session, allowing you to test changes without restarting the IPython environment.\n\nIf you're using Jupyter Notebook, another useful tool is the `%autoreload` magic command which can be used to automatically reload all modules before executing a new line. You can set it up like this:\n\n```python\n%load_ext autoreload\n%autoreload 2\n```\n\nThis will ensure that all changes to your modules are automatically reloaded, which can be very convenient during development."
