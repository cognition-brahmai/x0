Currently, I'm iterating over each item, marking it for deletion (for example, by setting it to `None`), and then filtering the list with a comprehension. However, this approach requires iterating over the list twice and mutates the data. I am looking for a more idiomatic or efficient way to do this. Here's my current code:\n\n```python\nn = 3\n\ndef condition(x):\n    return x < 5\n\ndata = [1, 10, 2, 9, 3, 8, 4, 7]\nout = do_remove(data, n, condition)\nprint(out)  # [10, 9, 8, 4, 7] (1, 2, and 3 are removed, 4 remains)\n```"

        "content": "To remove the first `n` items from a list that match a given condition in a more efficient and idiomatic way, you can use a single pass through the list while keeping track of how many items have been removed. You can achieve this by creating a new list and appending only the items that either don't match the condition or exceed the count of `n` items matched.\n\nHere is a possible implementation:\n\n```python\ndef do_remove(data, n, condition):\n    result = []\n    removed_count = 0\n    \n    for item in data:\n        if removed_count < n and condition(item):\n            removed_count += 1\n        else:\n            result.append(item)\n    \n    return result\n\nn = 3\n\ndef condition(x):\n    return x < 5\n\ndata = [1, 10, 2, 9, 3, 8, 4, 7]\nout = do_remove(data, n, condition)\nprint(out)  # Output: [10, 9, 8, 4, 7]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Single Pass**: The function iterates through the list only once, making it more efficient.\n- **Condition and Count**: For each item, it checks if the current count of removed items that match the condition is less than `n`. If it is, and the item matches the condition, it simply increments the count of removed items.\n- **Building the Result**: If the item does not match the condition or if the count of removed items has already reached `n`, the item is appended to the `result` list. This ensures that only the first `n` matching items are removed.\n\nThis approach is more efficient as it avoids mutating the original list and only makes a single pass through the data."
