I have overridden the look of a TextArea widget through two ways: using formfield_overrides in admin.py and with a custom form in forms.py. However, in both cases, the actual size of the text area is more than 1 row (in fact, it's 2 rows). Here is how my rendered HTML looks. I've attached a screenshot for reference. According to W3C reference for text area, the size of a textarea can also be specified by the CSS height and width properties. Is it possible that Django's own CSS theme is responsible for this odd behavior of the widget? Can someone suggest a solution to this issue?"

        "content": "When working with the Django admin interface, it's possible that the default CSS provided by Django is affecting the appearance and size of your `TextArea` widget. Here are a few ways to control the size of a `TextArea` widget:\n\n1. **Using `formfield_overrides` in `admin.py`:**\n\n   You can specify the widget's attributes directly in the `formfield_overrides` option to control its size. Here's an example:\n\n   ```python\n   from django.db import models\n   from django.contrib import admin\n   from django.forms import Textarea\n\n   class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n       formfield_overrides = {\n           models.TextField: {'widget': Textarea(attrs={'rows': 1, 'cols': 40})},\n       }\n\n   admin.site.register(MyModel, MyModelAdmin)\n   ```\n\n2. **Using a custom form in `forms.py`:**\n\n   If you are using a custom form, you can specify the widget attributes in the form's `Meta` class:\n\n   ```python\n   from django import forms\n   from .models import MyModel\n\n   class MyModelForm(forms.ModelForm):\n       class Meta:\n           model = MyModel\n           fields = '__all__'\n           widgets = {\n               'my_text_field': forms.Textarea(attrs={'rows': 1, 'cols': 40}),\n           }\n   ```\n\n   Then, reference this form in your admin class:\n\n   ```python\n   from django.contrib import admin\n   from .models import MyModel\n   from .forms import MyModelForm\n\n   class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n       form = MyModelForm\n\n   admin.site.register(MyModel, MyModelAdmin)\n   ```\n\n3. **Overriding CSS:**\n\n   If Django's CSS is overriding your widget attributes, you can add custom CSS to adjust the size of the `TextArea`. You can create an admin CSS file and include it in your `admin.py`:\n\n   - Create a CSS file, for example, `static/admin_extra.css`:\n\n     ```css\n     textarea {\n         height: 30px; /* Adjust the height as needed */\n         width: 300px; /* Adjust the width as needed */\n     }\n     ```\n\n   - Include this CSS in your `admin.py`:\n\n     ```python\n     class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n         class Media:\n             css = {\n                 'all': ('admin_extra.css',),\n             }\n\n     admin.site.register(MyModel, MyModelAdmin)\n     ```\n\n4. **Inspect the CSS:**\n\n   Use browser developer tools to inspect the `TextArea` and check if any CSS rules are overriding your custom styles. You can identify the exact source of the styling and make necessary adjustments.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to control the size of the `TextArea` widget as per your requirements."
