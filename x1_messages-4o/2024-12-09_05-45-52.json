Here is the code I used:\n\n```R\nlibrary(MASS)\nlibrary(glmnet)\n\n# Data dimensions\np.tmp <- 100\nn.tmp <- 100\n\n# Data objects\nset.seed(1)\nX <- scale(mvrnorm(n.tmp, mu = rep(0, p.tmp), Sigma = diag(p.tmp)))\nbeta <- rep(0, p.tmp)\nbeta[sample(1:p.tmp, 10, replace = FALSE)] <- 10\nY.true <- X %*% beta\nY <- scale(Y.true + matrix(rnorm(n.tmp))) # Y.true + Gaussian noise\n\n# Run glmnet \nridge.fit.cv <- cv.glmnet(X, Y, alpha = 0)\nridge.fit.lambda <- ridge.fit.cv$lambda.1se\n\n# Extract coefficient values for lambda.1se (without intercept)\nridge.coef <- (coef(ridge.fit.cv, s = ridge.fit.lambda))[2:(p.tmp+1)]\n\n# Get coefficients \"by definition\"\nridge.coef.DEF <- solve(t(X) %*% X + ridge.fit.lambda * diag(p.tmp)) %*% t(X) %*% Y\n\n# Plot estimates\nplot(ridge.coef, type = \"l\", ylim = range(c(ridge.coef, ridge.coef.DEF)),\n     main = \"black: Ridge `glmnet`\\nred: Ridge by definition\")\nlines(ridge.coef.DEF, col = \"red\")\n```\nAnd here is the resulting plot:\n![Plot](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8ksYl.png)"

        "content": "The discrepancy you're observing between the coefficients obtained from `glmnet::glmnet` and those calculated manually using the textbook definition of Ridge regression could be due to several factors:\n\n1. **Standardization in `glmnet`:** By default, the `glmnet` function standardizes the predictors internally (i.e., scales them to have mean zero and variance one) before fitting the model. This is done even if you have already scaled the design matrix `X` yourself. This means that when you extract the coefficients, they are based on the standardized version of `X`. To check if this is the case, you can set the `standardize` argument in `cv.glmnet` to `FALSE` and see if the coefficients align better with your manual calculations.\n\n   ```r\n   ridge.fit.cv <- cv.glmnet(X, Y, alpha = 0, standardize = FALSE)\n   ```\n\n2. **Intercept Handling:** The `glmnet` package automatically handles the intercept term, whereas your manual calculation assumes that the intercept is zero (since you've scaled `Y` and `X`). If `glmnet` is including an intercept, it may affect the coefficients slightly. When you scaled `Y` and `X`, the intercept should indeed be zero, but it's worth double-checking how `glmnet` treats it.\n\n3. **Numerical Precision and Optimization Differences:** The `glmnet` package likely uses optimized numerical routines to solve the Ridge regression problem, which may handle numerical precision and regularization slightly differently than a straightforward matrix inversion calculation. This can lead to small differences in the coefficients.\n\n4. **Regularization Path:** `glmnet` solves the optimization problem along a path of lambda values, which can sometimes affect the solution, especially if there are numerical stability issues in the inversion process.\n\nTo further investigate, you can try:\n\n- Setting `intercept = FALSE` in `cv.glmnet` to ensure no intercept is being used.\n- Double-checking the scaling of `X` and `Y` to ensure they are zero-mean and unit-variance.\n- Verifying the lambda value used in the manual calculation matches exactly with `lambda.1se`.\n\nBy addressing these points, you should be able to get more consistent results between the two methods."
