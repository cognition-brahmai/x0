I've been using list comprehension in the past, but I realize it's inefficient because it continues to check all items in the list even after a match is found. Here is my previous approach:\n\n```python\nr = re.compile('.*search.*')\nif [line for line in output if r.match(line)]:\n  do_stuff()\n```\n\nI've tried improving this by breaking the loop after finding a match:\n\n```python\nr = re.compile('.*search.*')\nfor line in output:\n  if r.match(line):\n    do_stuff()\n    break\n```\n\nBut I'm wondering if there's a more Pythonic way to do this."

        "content": "You're on the right track with your second approach, which breaks out of the loop as soon as a match is found. If you're looking for a more Pythonic and potentially more efficient way to achieve this, you can use the `any()` function combined with a generator expression. This approach is concise and short-circuits as soon as a match is found, similar to your loop with a `break`. Here's how you might use it:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nr = re.compile('.*search.*')\nif any(r.match(line) for line in output):\n    do_stuff()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`any()` Function**: The `any()` function returns `True` if at least one of the elements in the provided iterable is true. It stops evaluating the iterable as soon as it finds a `True` value, making it efficient for this kind of task.\n  \n- **Generator Expression**: `(r.match(line) for line in output)` is a generator expression that lazily evaluates each line against the regex `r`. This means that lines are only processed as needed, and as soon as a match is found, the evaluation stops.\n\nThis approach is not only efficient but also clear and concise, making it a good choice for this kind of task."
