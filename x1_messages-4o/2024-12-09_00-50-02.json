The code I am using is as follows:\n```python\nfrom imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE\nsmt = SMOTE(random_state=0)\nX_train_SMOTE, y_train_SMOTE = smt.fit_sample(X_train, y_train)\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the `fit_sample` method has been deprecated in more recent versions of the `imblearn` library. Instead, you should use the `fit_resample` method. The `fit_sample` method was replaced with `fit_resample` starting from imbalanced-learn version 0.4.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use `fit_resample`:\n\n```python\nfrom imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE\n\nsmt = SMOTE(random_state=0)\nX_train_SMOTE, y_train_SMOTE = smt.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)\n```\n\nBy updating your code to use `fit_resample`, you should no longer encounter the `AttributeError`. Make sure your imbalanced-learn library is up-to-date to access the latest features and methods. You can update it using pip if necessary:\n\n```bash\npip install -U imbalanced-learn\n```\n\nThis will ensure you have the latest version of the library where `fit_resample` is supported."
