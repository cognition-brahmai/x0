In the given list, \"HB\" and \"2B\" are considered softer than \"2H\". The Scala code snippet can be modified as follows:\n\n```scala\nval pencils = List((\"A\", \"HB\", 6, 1), (\"B\", \"2B\", 7, 2), (\"C\", \"4H\", 5, 3), (\"D\", \"2H\", 8, 4))\n\n// Define a function to determine if a grade is softer than 2H\ndef isSofterThan2H(grade: String): Boolean = {\n  val softerGrades = Set(\"B\", \"HB\", \"F\", \"H\", \"2B\", \"3B\", \"4B\", \"5B\", \"6B\", \"7B\", \"8B\", \"9B\")\n  softerGrades.contains(grade)\n}\n\nval totalSoftPrice = pencils.filter(pencil => isSofterThan2H(pencil._2)).map(_._4).sum\n\nprintln(s\"Total price of pencils with a lead grade softer than 2H: $$${totalSoftPrice}\")\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- We define a function `isSofterThan2H` that checks if a given lead grade is softer than \"2H\".\n- We use this function in the `filter` method to select only the pencils that have a softer lead grade.\n- Finally, we calculate the sum of the prices of these selected pencils."
