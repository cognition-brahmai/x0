Here's the code I'm currently using:\n\n```python\nfor i in xrange(20):\n    print 'a',\n```\n\nThe output I receive is 'a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a'. How can I modify this code to print 'a' 20 times without spaces, like 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is because of the comma at the end of the `print` statement, which adds a space by default between printed items. To print the character 'a' 20 times without any spaces, you can use the following approaches:\n\n1. Using the `print` function with `end` parameter (Python 3+):\n   ```python\n   for i in range(20):\n       print('a', end='')\n   ```\n\n2. Using string multiplication:\n   ```python\n   print('a' * 20)\n   ```\n\n3. Using `sys.stdout.write()` for Python 2.7:\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   for i in range(20):\n       sys.stdout.write('a')\n   sys.stdout.flush()  # Ensure output is printed immediately\n   ```\n\nThe first method is the most straightforward for Python 3, while the second method is the most concise and works in both Python 2 and 3. The third method is useful if you are working in an environment where you need to use Python 2.7."
