        "content": "To write and display LaTeX code in an IPython Notebook (now commonly referred to as a Jupyter Notebook), you can use Markdown cells for static LaTeX expressions or Python code cells for dynamic LaTeX rendering. Here are the steps for both:\n\n### Using Markdown Cells\n\n1. **Insert a Markdown Cell:**\n   - In your Jupyter Notebook, click on the \"+\" button to insert a new cell.\n   - Change the cell type to \"Markdown\" by using the dropdown menu or pressing `M` after selecting the cell.\n\n2. **Write LaTeX Code:**\n   - Use dollar signs `$...$` for inline LaTeX. For example: `This is an inline equation $E=mc^2$.`\n   - Use double dollar signs `$$...$$` for display-style (centered) equations. For example:\n     ```markdown\n     $$E = mc^2$$\n     ```\n\n3. **Render the Markdown Cell:**\n   - Run the cell by pressing `Shift + Enter`, and the LaTeX will be rendered properly.\n\n### Using Python Code Cells\n\n1. **Import the IPython Display Module:**\n   - In a Python code cell, first import the `display` and `Math` functions from `IPython.display`:\n     ```python\n     from IPython.display import display, Math\n     ```\n\n2. **Display LaTeX Code:**\n   - Use the `display` and `Math` functions to render LaTeX. For example:\n     ```python\n     display(Math(r'E=mc^2'))\n     ```\n\n3. **Run the Code Cell:**\n   - Execute the cell by pressing `Shift + Enter` to display the LaTeX formula.\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- For complex equations, consider using LaTeX environments like `align` or `equation`. These can be used within Markdown cells by using the `$$...$$` syntax.\n- Jupyter Notebooks support a wide range of LaTeX commands, so you can create complex mathematical expressions.\n- If you need to debug LaTeX code, try rendering small parts of it to identify errors.\n\nBy using these methods, you can effectively write and display beautifully formatted mathematical expressions in your Jupyter Notebook."
