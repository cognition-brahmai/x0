        "content": "To find the least value of \\( x \\) that is an integer multiple of each element in the given set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}\\), we need to calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the numbers in the set. The LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest number that is evenly divisible by each of the numbers in the set.\n\nHere's a step-by-step solution in R:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**: Determine the prime factorization of each number in the set.\n2. **Maximum Power of Each Prime**: For each distinct prime, find the highest power that appears in the factorizations.\n3. **Calculate the LCM**: Multiply the highest powers of all primes to obtain the LCM.\n\nBelow is the R code implementing this approach:\n\n```r\n# Helper function to find prime factors\nprimeFactors <- function(n) {\n  factors <- c()\n  # Check for number of 2s\n  while (n %% 2 == 0) {\n    factors <- c(factors, 2)\n    n <- n / 2\n  }\n  # Check for other primes\n  for (i in seq(3, sqrt(n), 2)) {\n    while (n %% i == 0) {\n      factors <- c(factors, i)\n      n <- n / i\n    }\n  }\n  if (n > 2) {\n    factors <- c(factors, n)\n  }\n  return(factors)\n}\n\n# Define the set of integers\nset <- 1:10\n\n# Find the prime factorization and count the highest power of each prime\nprime_power <- list()\nfor (num in set) {\n  factors <- table(primeFactors(num))\n  for (prime in names(factors)) {\n    prime_power[[prime]] <- max(prime_power[[prime]], factors[prime], na.rm = TRUE)\n  }\n}\n\n# Compute the LCM by multiplying the highest powers of all primes\nlcm <- prod(sapply(names(prime_power), function(prime) as.numeric(prime)^prime_power[[prime]]))\n\n# Output the result\ncat(\"The least value of x that is an integer multiple of each element in the set is\", lcm, \"\\n\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **primeFactors Function**: This function calculates the prime factors of a given number and returns them as a vector.\n- **Loop through the Set**: For each number in the set, we compute the prime factors and tally the maximum power required for each prime.\n- **Calculate the LCM**: The LCM is determined by multiplying the highest powers of all prime factors found across the numbers in the set.\n- **Output**: The calculated LCM is printed, which is the least integer multiple of all elements in the set.\n\nRunning this code will give you the least value of \\( x \\) that is an integer multiple of each element in the set."
