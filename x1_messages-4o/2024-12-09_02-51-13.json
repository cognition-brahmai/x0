Here is the Python 2.7 code:\n\n```python\ngwfuncs = [reboot, flush_macs, flush_cache, new_gw, revert_gw, send_log]      \ngw_func_dict = {chr(2**i): func for i, func in enumerate(gwfuncs[:8])}\n```"

Here's how you can rewrite the code:\n\n```python\ngwfuncs = [reboot, flush_macs, flush_cache, new_gw, revert_gw, send_log]\ngw_func_dict = {}\n\nfor i, func in enumerate(gwfuncs[:8]):\n    gw_func_dict[chr(2**i)] = func\n```\n\nThis code uses a simple `for` loop to iterate over the `gwfuncs` list, using `enumerate` to obtain both the index `i` and the function `func`. It then constructs the dictionary by assigning `chr(2**i)` as the key and `func` as the value, just like the dictionary comprehension did. This approach is compatible with earlier versions of Python that do not support dictionary comprehensions."
