I am not sure how to accomplish this securely and cleanly. Here's a pseudocode of what I'm aiming for:\n\n```bash\nif (whoami != root)\nthen echo \"Please run as root\"\nelse (do stuff)\nfi\nexit\n```\n\nThe script will execute commands that require root access hence running it as a normal user will result in an error. My aim is to smoothly execute a script that needs root commands without using sudo within the script. Can someone guide me on how to implement this?"

        "content": "To ensure that your script is executed as root, you can check the effective user ID (`EUID`) of the user running the script. The `EUID` will be `0` for the root user. You can use a simple `if` statement to check this and display a message if the script is not run as root. Here's how you can implement this in your bash script:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Check if the script is run as root\nif [ \"$EUID\" -ne 0 ]; then\n  echo \"Please run as root.\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\n# Your script logic here\necho \"Running with root privileges\"\n#do stuff\n\nexit 0\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- `\"$EUID\"`: This variable holds the effective user ID of the current user. It is `0` for the root user.\n- `-ne 0`: This condition checks if the `EUID` is not equal to `0`.\n- `echo \"Please run as root.\"`: If the condition is true (i.e., the script is not being run as root), this message will be displayed.\n- `exit 1`: The script exits with a status code of `1` to indicate an error.\n- If the script is run as root, it proceeds to execute the commands within the `else` block.\n\nBy structuring your script this way, you ensure that it will only proceed if it has the necessary root privileges, and it will provide a clear message if not."
