An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or achieving a specific task. It can be thought of as a set of instructions that a computer program can follow to perform a certain task.\nNow, could you please provide an example of an algorithm that you have written in Python code? It can be any algorithm, such as a sorting algorithm or a search algorithm. Feel free to include comments to explain the steps of the algorithm."

        "content": "Certainly! Let's look at an example of a simple sorting algorithm: the Bubble Sort. Bubble Sort is a straightforward algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Here's how you can implement it in Python:\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    # Traverse through all elements in the array\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Last i elements are already in place, so we can ignore them\n        for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n                # Debugging statement to show the swap process\n                print(f\"Swapped {arr[j+1]} with {arr[j]}: {arr}\")\n    return arr\n\n# Example usage\nexample_list = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nsorted_list = bubble_sort(example_list)\nprint(\"Sorted list:\", sorted_list)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Outer Loop (i):** Runs from the start of the list to the end. With each pass, the algorithm moves the next largest unsorted element to its correct position.\n2. **Inner Loop (j):** Compares each pair of adjacent elements. If the element on the left is greater than the element on the right, they are swapped.\n3. **Swapping:** If a swap is made, the inner loop continues, ensuring that the largest unsorted element bubbles up to its correct position.\n4. **Optimization:** After each pass through the list, the next largest element is in place, so the inner loop can ignore the sorted elements at the end of the list.\n\nThis algorithm has a time complexity of \\(O(n^2)\\), making it inefficient for large lists, but it's a good demonstration of basic sorting principles."
