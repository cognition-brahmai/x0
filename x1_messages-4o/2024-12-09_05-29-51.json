Is there anything similar in Python that can allow me to search, install, and maintain Python modules as easily as CPAN? Also, is there a system in Python that can handle dependencies automatically? I attempted to install a module in Python by downloading a zip file from a website, unzipping it, and then running `sudo python setup.py install`, but it's looking for another module. I would prefer not to chase dependencies manually. Is there a simpler way to do this?"

        "content": "Welcome to the world of Python! Python has an ecosystem of tools and resources that can offer similar functionalities to Perl's CPAN, making your transition smoother.\n\n1. **PyPI (Python Package Index):** PyPI is the equivalent of CPAN for Python. It is the official repository for Python packages. You can search for, install, and maintain Python modules using it.\n\n2. **pip:** This is Python's package manager, similar to Perl's CPAN client. It allows you to install and manage Python packages from PyPI. Pip handles dependencies automatically, so you don't have to chase them manually. You can install a package using:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install package-name\n   ```\n\n   If you need to install packages system-wide, you might need to use:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo pip install package-name\n   ```\n\n3. **Virtual Environments:** To avoid installing packages system-wide and to handle dependencies for different projects more effectively, you can use virtual environments. A virtual environment is an isolated Python environment that allows you to manage dependencies for a project separately. You can create a virtual environment using:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv myenv\n   ```\n\n   Activate the virtual environment:\n\n   - On Windows:\n     ```bash\n     myenv\\Scripts\\activate\n     ```\n   - On macOS/Linux:\n     ```bash\n     source myenv/bin/activate\n     ```\n\n   Once activated, you can use `pip` to install packages, and they will be confined to that environment.\n\n4. **Requirements Files:** For project dependency management, you can use a `requirements.txt` file. This file lists all the packages your project depends on. You can generate it using:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip freeze > requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n   To install dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt` file, use:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n5. **Conda:** If you are dealing with data science or scientific computing, you might also consider using Conda, which is an alternative package manager that can manage packages and dependencies across languages, not just Python.\n\nBy leveraging these tools, you should find managing Python packages to be a streamlined process similar to your experience with Perl's CPAN."
