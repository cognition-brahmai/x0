        "content": "Calculating the square root of numbers in Python is straightforward, especially for positive integers. You can use the built-in `math` module, which provides a `sqrt` function specifically for this purpose. Here's a basic example of how you can do this:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_square_root(number):\n    if number < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot calculate the square root of a negative number.\")\n    return math.sqrt(number)\n\n# Example usage\nnumber = 25\nsquare_root = calculate_square_root(number)\nprint(f\"The square root of {number} is {square_root}\")\n```\n\nIn this function, we first check if the number is negative, since the square root of a negative number is not defined in the realm of real numbers. For positive integers, the `math.sqrt` function will work perfectly and efficiently.\n\n### Potential issues:\n1. **Negative Inputs**: As mentioned, the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real number system. If you need to handle such cases, you would need to work with complex numbers, which Python can handle using the `cmath` module.\n\n2. **Type of Inputs**: Ensure that the input is a number (integer or float). If you're accepting user input, you might need to validate and convert it properly before calculating the square root.\n\n3. **Precision**: For very large numbers (close to a billion as you mentioned), the result might have minor floating-point precision issues, but these are typically negligible for practical purposes.\n\n4. **Performance**: Since you're dealing with numbers less than a billion, performance won't be an issue. The `math.sqrt` function is designed to handle these efficiently.\n\nFor numbers greater than zero, the `math.sqrt` function should work without any issues. If you need to handle negative numbers and want to return complex numbers, you can use the `cmath` module like this:\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef calculate_complex_square_root(number):\n    return cmath.sqrt(number)\n\n# Example usage\nnumber = -25\ncomplex_square_root = calculate_complex_square_root(number)\nprint(f\"The complex square root of {number} is {complex_square_root}\")\n```\n\nThis will return a complex number as the square root, which includes a real and an imaginary part."
