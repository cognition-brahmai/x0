When I plot the data using the following code:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nN = 10\nx = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]\ny = np.random.rand(N)\n\nplt.scatter(x, y)\nplt.show()\n```\nThe plot that gets generated only shows even values on the x-axis. How can I modify my code so that matplotlib shows all the x coordinates from 1 to 10?"

Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nN = 10\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\ny = np.random.rand(N)\n\nplt.scatter(x, y)\n\n# Set the x-axis ticks to show all values from 1 to 10\nplt.xticks(x)\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis code explicitly sets the x-axis ticks to include all the values in your `x` list, ensuring that each integer from 1 to 10 is labeled on the x-axis."
