        "content": "Navigating a complex situation involving personal emotional struggles and a friend's illness requires a thoughtful and empathetic approach. Here's how John can apply the given formula to address his challenges:\n\n### Emotional Intelligence\n\n1. **Self-awareness**: John should start by acknowledging his own emotions regarding his friend's diagnosis and how it affects him personally. This awareness will help him understand his reactions and the impact they have on his decision-making process.\n\n2. **Self-regulation**: Once aware of his emotions, John should work on managing them effectively. This might involve practicing mindfulness or stress-relief techniques to maintain a balanced perspective and avoid making impulsive decisions.\n\n3. **Motivation**: John can use his intrinsic motivation to remain focused on supporting his friend while also taking care of his own well-being. Setting personal goals, such as staying positive and being a reliable support system, can help him stay motivated.\n\n4. **Empathy**: Understanding and sharing the feelings of his friend is crucial. John should actively listen to his friend, offering a compassionate ear and understanding the impact of the illness from his friend's perspective.\n\n5. **Social skills**: John should leverage his social skills to effectively communicate with his friend and others involved. This includes being approachable, maintaining open lines of communication, and fostering a supportive environment.\n\n### Multi-dimensional Problem-Solving Skills\n\n1. **Identifying the Problem**: John needs to clearly define the challenges he faces. This includes his own emotional struggles and the specific ways he wants to support his friend through their diagnosis.\n\n2. **Generating Alternative Solutions**: John should brainstorm possible ways to address these challenges. This might include seeking professional counseling for himself, organizing support groups for his friend, or finding activities that they can enjoy together to lift spirits.\n\n3. **Evaluating and Selecting Solutions**: John should weigh the pros and cons of each potential solution, considering factors like practicality, emotional impact, and the needs of both himself and his friend. Choosing solutions that balance support with self-care is essential.\n\n4. **Implementing and Monitoring the Solution**: Once solutions are selected, John should implement them while monitoring their effectiveness. For example, he could set regular check-ins with his friend to ensure that the support is helpful and adjust his approach as needed.\n\n5. **Reflecting and Learning from the Experience**: After some time, John should reflect on the entire process. What worked well? What could be improved? This reflection will not only help him in this situation but also prepare him for future challenges.\n\nBy integrating emotional intelligence with structured problem-solving skills, John can navigate the complexities of his situation effectively, ensuring he supports his friend while also managing his own emotional health."
