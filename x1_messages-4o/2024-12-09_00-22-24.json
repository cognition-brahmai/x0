When a client connects, the server prints out the connection details. However, I am unsure about the return value of `Socket.accept()`. Specifically, I am confused about the second part of the tuple that gets printed in the server console when a connection is established. The output looks something like this:\n\n```\nGot connection from ('192.168.0.99', 49170)\nGot connection from ('192.168.0.99', 49171)\nGot connection from ('192.168.0.99', 49172)\nGot connection from ('192.168.0.99', 49173)\n```\nCan someone explain what this second value in the tuple represents?"

        "content": "Certainly! When you use the `Socket.accept()` method in Python's `socket` module, it returns a tuple consisting of two elements:\n\n1. **Client Socket Object**: The first element is a new socket object representing the connection with the client. This socket is what you will use to send and receive data from the client that has connected.\n\n2. **Client Address**: The second element is a tuple containing the IP address and port number of the client that has connected to the server. This tuple provides the remote address of the client.\n\nIn your example:\n\n```\nGot connection from ('192.168.0.99', 49170)\n```\n\nThe second value `49170` is the port number that the client's operating system assigned to the client's end of the connection. This is the ephemeral port number that the client's system uses to send and receive data for this particular connection. Every time a new connection is established, the client's system selects an available ephemeral port number, which is why you see different numbers (`49170`, `49171`, `49172`, `49173`) for each connection in your output. These ports are typically chosen from a range designated for temporary use by the system for client-side connections."
