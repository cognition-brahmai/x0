In Python, you can achieve this by identifying the key word and then printing it. Here's a simple code snippet that does that:\n\n```python\nsentence = \"The exact moment of her departure remains unknown\"\ndeclarative_word = \"unknown\"\nprint(declarative_word)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nunknown\n```\n\nThis single word captures the essence of the original sentence in a declarative form."
