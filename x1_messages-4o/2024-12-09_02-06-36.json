        "content": "The issue with your code arises from the way you're trying to evaluate the condition. When using `grep`, it will return an exit status code that you can use to determine if a match was found. Using command substitution `$(...)` to capture the output of `grep` is not necessary here, and can lead to complications if the output contains spaces or if the output is empty.\n\nInstead, you should directly use the command within the condition and check its exit status. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```bash\nif ! grep -q \"sysa\" /etc/passwd; then\n    echo \"ERROR - The user sysa could not be looked up\"\n    exit 2\nfi\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `grep -q` is used to suppress the output of `grep`, as you only care about the exit status (whether it found the pattern or not).\n- The `!` operator negates the exit status of `grep`. If `grep` does not find the string \"sysa\", it exits with a non-zero status, making the `if` condition true.\n- This way, if \"sysa\" is not found, the error message is printed and the script exits with status code 2."
