I am using the following line of code to return the regex:\n\n```python\nModel.objects.filter(location_path__iregex=r'^[a-zA-Z]/$')\n```\n\nHowever, it is not returning the filtered data. The demo data for location_path is ['sequences/', 'abc/xyz/', 'abc/aaaa/aaa', 'pqr/']. I want to filter data like 'sequences/', 'pqr/' which contains any characters from a-z and ends with '/'. Can someone provide me with the correct regex pattern and syntax?"

The pattern should allow for multiple letters before the final slash. Here\u2019s the corrected regex pattern and the appropriate line of code:\n\n```python\nModel.objects.filter(location_path__iregex=r'^[a-zA-Z]+/$')\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Regex Pattern:\n- `^`: Asserts the start of the string.\n- `[a-zA-Z]+`: Matches one or more (`+`) occurrences of any letter (both lowercase and uppercase).\n- `/$`: Ensures that the string ends with a slash.\n\nThis pattern will match any string that is composed of one or more letters followed by a slash at the end, which fits your requirement for strings like 'sequences/' and 'pqr/'."
