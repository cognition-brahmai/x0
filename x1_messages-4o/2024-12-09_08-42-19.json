Can somebody help me understand why this is happening? Here's the code I am using:\n\n```python\nlst = [1, 2, 3]\n\nlst[0] = lst\nlst[1] = lst\nlst[2] = lst\n\nprint(lst)\n\nprint(sorted(lst))\n\nlst.sort()\n\nprint(lst)\n```\n\nThe output I get from this code is:\n\n```\n[[...], [...], [...]]\n[[[...], [...], [...]], [[...], [...], [...]], [[...], [...], [...]]]\n[[...], [...], [...]]\n```\n\nI am confused by the output from `print(sorted(lst))`. Could this be caused by some form of recursion?"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is due to the self-referential nature of your list. Let's break down what's happening in your code:\n\n1. Initially, you have a list `lst` with elements `[1, 2, 3]`.\n\n2. You then set each element of the list to reference the list itself:\n   ```python\n   lst[0] = lst\n   lst[1] = lst\n   lst[2] = lst\n   ```\n   Now, `lst` is `[[...], [...], [...]]`, where each `[...]` represents a reference to the list itself, leading to a self-referential structure.\n\n3. When you print the list `lst`, Python displays it as `[[...], [...], [...]]` to indicate the self-referential nature.\n\n4. When you use `sorted(lst)`, Python tries to sort the list, but since all elements are actually the same reference to `lst`, the order doesn't change. The sorted output is essentially a new list where each element is still a reference to the original list, hence it appears as `[[[...], [...], [...]], [[...], [...], [...]], [[...], [...], [...]]]`.\n\n5. Using `lst.sort()` also doesn't change the list since all elements are identical references, and the list remains as `[[...], [...], [...]]`.\n\nThe recursion-like appearance is due to the list containing references to itself, creating a structure that Python represents with ellipses (`[...]`) to avoid infinite recursion when printing. This is not actual recursion in the programming sense but rather a circular reference.\n\nIn practical terms, sorting a list composed entirely of references to itself doesn't have meaningful behavior, as all elements are effectively identical in terms of identity and content. If you need to sort a list with actual comparable elements, you'd have to avoid self-referential assignments."
