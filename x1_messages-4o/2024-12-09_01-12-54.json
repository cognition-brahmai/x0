I understand that this module is not enabled by default and has to be enabled using the following code:\n\n```python\nimport faulthandler\nfaulthandler.enable()\n```\n\nThe feature seems quite useful, so I'm curious as to why it isn't enabled by default. Are there any potential negative effects on performance or other downsides to using the 'faulthandler' module?"

        "content": "The `faulthandler` module in Python is indeed a very useful tool for debugging, as it provides detailed traceback information when a segmentation fault or other low-level fatal error occurs. However, it is not enabled by default for several reasons:\n\n1. **Performance Overhead**: While the performance impact of enabling `faulthandler` is generally minimal, there is still some overhead involved in monitoring low-level signals and generating traceback information. In performance-critical applications, even small overheads can be significant.\n\n2. **Signal Interference**: `faulthandler` works by intercepting low-level signals (like SIGSEGV) that the operating system sends to the process. Enabling it by default might interfere with other signal handling mechanisms that a program or its libraries are using, potentially causing unexpected behavior.\n\n3. **Debugging Context**: Not all environments require such detailed debugging information. In production environments, for instance, the priority might be to handle errors gracefully rather than producing verbose debug output, which could be seen as a security risk or simply as unnecessary noise.\n\n4. **Backward Compatibility**: Enabling `faulthandler` by default could change the behavior of existing programs that are not expecting it, which goes against the principle of backward compatibility. Developers should have control over whether or not to enable this feature based on their specific needs.\n\n5. **Security Concerns**: In some cases, exposing detailed traceback information could inadvertently leak sensitive information about the system or the code, which might be undesirable in a production or secure environment.\n\nIn summary, while `faulthandler` is a powerful tool for diagnosing hard-to-track-down errors, it is left to the developer's discretion to enable it when needed, to avoid any unintended side effects in environments where its benefits are not required or desired."
