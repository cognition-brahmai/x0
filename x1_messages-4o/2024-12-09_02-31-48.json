        "content": "When using the IPython Qt Console, the leading triple dots and colons you see in the copied text are part of the console's syntax highlighting and formatting. These are used to indicate continuation lines and block structure in the interactive console but can be inconvenient when copying code for use elsewhere.\n\nHere are a few ways you could handle this issue:\n\n1. **Use `%paste` Magic Command**:\n   - If you're copying the code to another IPython session or Jupyter Notebook, you can use the `%paste` magic command. This command pastes the code without the prompts.\n   - Copy the code as usual, then in the target IPython environment, simply type `%paste` and press Enter. This should paste the code without the additional characters.\n\n2. **Edit in an External Editor**:\n   - Another approach is to write your code directly in an external text editor or IDE (like VSCode, PyCharm, etc.) that doesn't add these prompts. This way, you can avoid the issue entirely by working with plain text files.\n\n3. **Use a Script**:\n   - If you frequently need to clean up code copied from the Qt Console, consider writing a small script to remove the unwanted characters. Here's a simple example in Python:\n\n   ```python\n   def clean_code(input_text):\n       lines = input_text.splitlines()\n       cleaned_lines = [line[5:] if line.startswith('...: ') else line for line in lines]\n       return '\\n'.join(cleaned_lines)\n\n   # Example usage\n   copied_code = \"\"\"\\\n   ...: class notathing(object):\n   ...: ...:     def __init__(self):\n   ...: ...:         pass\n   ...: \"\"\"\n   \n   print(clean_code(copied_code))\n   ```\n\n   This script removes the leading `...: ` from each line if present.\n\n4. **Configure IPython**:\n   - You might want to check if there are configuration options to modify the appearance of the console output. Look into the IPython configuration files (usually found in `~/.ipython/profile_default/`) for any settings related to prompts or output formatting.\n\n5. **Use a Different Interface**:\n   - Consider using a different interface like Jupyter Notebook, which does not include these prompts when you copy code cells.\n\nBy using one or a combination of these methods, you should be able to copy code from the IPython Qt Console without the additional formatting characters."
