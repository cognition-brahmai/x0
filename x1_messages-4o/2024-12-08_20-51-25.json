        "content": "To solve this, we need to evaluate each component separately:\n\n1. **erf(0.8):** The error function erf(x) is a mathematical function used in probability, statistics, and partial differential equations. For x = 0.8, the value is approximately 0.7421.\n\n2. **erfc(1.2):** The complementary error function erfc(x) is defined as 1 - erf(x). For x = 1.2, erfc(1.2) is approximately 0.1151.\n\n3. **erfinv(0.3):** The inverse error function erfinv(y) is the value of x such that erf(x) = y. For y = 0.3, erfinv(0.3) is approximately 0.2725.\n\nNow, we can perform the calculation:\n\n\\[ \\text{erf}(0.8) + \\text{erfc}(1.2) - \\text{erfinv}(0.3) \\approx 0.7421 + 0.1151 - 0.2725 = 0.5847. \\]\n\nSo, the result is approximately 0.5847."
