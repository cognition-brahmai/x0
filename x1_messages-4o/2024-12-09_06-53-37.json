Is there a command-line flag for Python that can help me achieve this? I am currently using PyDev's debugger, setting breakpoints and checking the call stack at certain points in my program, but I would prefer to see a comprehensive list of all functions called throughout the life of the program."

        "content": "To trace function calls in a Python script without manually adding print statements, you can use the `sys.setprofile()` function, which allows you to set a profiling function that will be called on every function call, function return, or exception. Here\u2019s how you can use it to print the names of all functions as they are called:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef trace_calls(frame, event, arg):\n    if event == 'call':\n        code = frame.f_code\n        func_name = code.co_name\n        print(f\"Function called: {func_name}\")\n    return trace_calls\n\ndef main():\n    # Your script's main logic here\n    pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    sys.setprofile(trace_calls)\n    main()\n```\n\nTo use this:\n\n1. Define a `trace_calls` function that takes `frame`, `event`, and `arg` as arguments. The `event` argument indicates the type of event ('call', 'return', 'exception'), and the `frame` argument contains details about the current function call.\n\n2. Use `sys.setprofile(trace_calls)` to set this function as the profiling function. The function will automatically be called on every function call.\n\n3. Run your script, and it will print the name of each function as it is called.\n\nAs for command-line flags, Python doesn't have a built-in flag specifically for tracing function calls. However, using `sys.setprofile()` is a flexible way to achieve this without modifying your code extensively. If you're interested in more advanced tracing, you might also consider using the `trace` module, which can provide a detailed execution report. For example:\n\n```bash\npython -m trace --trace your_script.py\n```\n\nThis command will execute `your_script.py` with tracing enabled, printing a line-by-line trace of function calls and other operations."
