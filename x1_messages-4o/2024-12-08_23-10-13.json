Your goal is to choose the correct gate to exit through based on the current time and weather conditions. \nIf it is daytime and sunny, you must exit through the gate with the sun symbol. If it is daytime and cloudy, you must exit through the gate with the cloud symbol. If it is nighttime and there is a full moon, you must exit through the gate with the moon symbol. \nHowever, if it is nighttime and there is not a full moon, you must use the symbol above the gate that corresponds to the direction of the wind. If the wind is coming from the east, you must exit through the gate with the sun symbol. If the wind is coming from the west, you must exit through the gate with the cloud symbol. If the wind is coming from the north, you must exit through the gate with the moon symbol.\nWhat is the correct gate to exit through if it is daytime and cloudy?"
