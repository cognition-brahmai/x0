I have a multi-line string defined as follows:\n\n```python\nfoo = \"\"\"\nthis is \na multi-line string.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\nMy parser-function receives a file-object as input and iterates over it. It also calls the next() method directly to skip lines, thus I require an iterator as input, not an iterable. I could use `lineiterator = iter(foo.splitlines())` but is there a more efficient way of doing this that doesn't involve traversing the string twice (once for the splitting, and then again by the parser)?"

        "content": "To create an iterator in Python that iterates over the individual lines of a multi-line string, similar to how a file-object would, you can use the `io.StringIO` module. This approach avoids traversing the string twice and provides an efficient way to achieve what you're looking for. `StringIO` creates an in-memory stream for text I/O, which behaves like a file object.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport io\n\nfoo = \"\"\"\nthis is \na multi-line string.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Create an in-memory text stream\nlineiterator = io.StringIO(foo)\n\n# Now you can use lineiterator as a file-like object\nfor line in lineiterator:\n    print(line.strip())  # Process each line\n\n# You can also use next() to skip lines as needed\nlineiterator.seek(0)  # Reset the stream position to the beginning\nprint(next(lineiterator).strip())  # Output: \"\"\nprint(next(lineiterator).strip())  # Output: \"this is\"\n```\n\nThe `io.StringIO` object acts like a file, allowing you to iterate over lines, use `next()`, and perform other file-like operations. This method is efficient and bypasses the need to split the string into a list of lines first."
