I have created a matrix, `A` using numpy as follows:\n```python\nimport numpy as np    \nA = np.matrix([[1,2,3,33],[4,5,6,66],[7,8,9,99]])\n```\nI am aware that `argmax` returns the index of the largest value. However, when I try to execute `np.argmax(A[1:,2])`, I am expecting it to give me the largest element from the second row till the end of the row (which is the third row) and along the third column. So, I expect the result to be 9 (as it is the largest number in the array [6,9]). But when I run this code in Python, it returns the value 1. Why is this happening? Additionally, if I want to return the largest element from row 2 onwards in column 3 (which is 9), how should I modify the code?"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is due to how `np.argmax()` works. When you use `np.argmax(A[1:,2])`, it only considers the sub-array you specified, which is `[6, 9]`. The function returns the index of the maximum value within that sub-array, not the value itself. In this case, `9` is the largest value and it is at index `1` of the sub-array `[6, 9]`.\n\nTo clarify:\n\n- `A[1:,2]` results in the array `[6, 9]`.\n- `np.argmax([6, 9])` returns `1`, which is the index of `9` within the array `[6, 9]`.\n\nIf you want to get the actual maximum value from that sub-array (i.e., `9`), you should use `np.max()` instead of `np.argmax()`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np    \nA = np.matrix([[1, 2, 3, 33], [4, 5, 6, 66], [7, 8, 9, 99]])\n\n# Get the maximum value from row 2 onwards in column 3\nmax_value = np.max(A[1:, 2])\nprint(max_value)\n```\n\nThis will output `9`, which is the largest number in the sub-array `[6, 9]`."
