        "content": "To sort a DataFrame in pandas by multiple columns, you can use the `sort_values` method. This method allows you to specify the columns by which you want to sort, as well as the sort order for each column. \n\nHere's how you can sort a DataFrame by column 'b' in ascending order and by column 'c' in descending order:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'a': [1, 2, 3, 4],\n    'b': [4, 3, 2, 1],\n    'c': [10, 20, 30, 40]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Sorting by 'b' in ascending order and 'c' in descending order\nsorted_df = df.sort_values(by=['b', 'c'], ascending=[True, False])\n\nprint(sorted_df)\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- We use `sort_values(by=['b', 'c'])` to specify that we want to sort by columns 'b' and 'c'.\n- The `ascending` parameter takes a list of boolean values, where `True` indicates ascending order and `False` indicates descending order. Here, `ascending=[True, False]` means that 'b' will be sorted in ascending order and 'c' in descending order. \n\nThis will give you the DataFrame sorted as specified."
