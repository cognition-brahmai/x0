        "content": "The approach you provided using a dictionary to track seen elements is a common and efficient way to remove duplicates from an array while maintaining the original order of elements in Swift. Here's a breakdown of how it works and an alternative using the `Set` data structure:\n\n### Original Approach Using Dictionary\n\nThe code you provided uses a dictionary to track whether an element has been seen before. This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, because dictionary lookups and insertions are generally O(1).\n\nHere's the code you shared:\n\n```swift\nlet array = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]\nvar dict = [Int: Bool]()\nvar result = [Int]()\nfor element in array {\n    if dict[element] == nil {\n        dict[element] = true\n        result.append(element)\n    }\n}\nprint(result) // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\n### Alternative Approach Using Set\n\nYou can also achieve this by using a `Set` to keep track of elements that have already been added to the result array. This method is equally efficient and more concise:\n\n```swift\nlet array = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]\nvar seen = Set<Int>()\nlet result = array.filter { element in\n    if seen.contains(element) {\n        return false\n    } else {\n        seen.insert(element)\n        return true\n    }\n}\nprint(result) // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initialization**: A `Set` named `seen` is used to store elements that have already been encountered.\n2. **Filtering**: The `filter` function iterates over the array, checking if each element is in the `seen` set.\n3. **Unique Check**: If an element is not in `seen`, it is added to both the `result` array and the `seen` set.\n4. **Output**: The `result` array contains only the unique elements, preserving the original order.\n\nBoth methods are efficient and maintain the original order of elements while removing duplicates. Choose the one that you find more readable and suits your coding style."
