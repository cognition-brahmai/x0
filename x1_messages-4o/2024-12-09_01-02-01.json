Currently, for an input file `filename.cu`, it generates output filenames in the form `cuda_compile_ptx_generated_filename.cu.ptx`. However, I need the output filenames to be in the `filename.ptx` format. Is there a solution to this issue?"

        "content": "To modify the output filename generated by the `cuda_compile_ptx` command in CMake, you'll need to customize the CMake script to control the naming of the generated PTX files. CMake's default behavior for handling CUDA files might not directly support the specific naming convention you want, but you can work around it using custom commands and targets. Here's a way to achieve the desired output filename format:\n\n1. **Use `add_custom_command` and `add_custom_target`:** You can define a custom command to invoke the NVCC compiler directly to generate the PTX file with your desired filename.\n\n2. **Example CMakeLists.txt:**\n\n   ```cmake\n   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.8)\n   project(CustomPTXName)\n\n   find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)\n\n   set(CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS \"${CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS} -ptx\")\n\n   # Input and output file names\n   set(CUDA_SOURCE_FILE ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/filename.cu)\n   set(PTX_OUTPUT_FILE ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/filename.ptx)\n\n   # Custom command to generate the PTX file\n   add_custom_command(\n       OUTPUT ${PTX_OUTPUT_FILE}\n       COMMAND ${CUDA_NVCC_EXECUTABLE} ${CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS} -o ${PTX_OUTPUT_FILE} ${CUDA_SOURCE_FILE}\n       DEPENDS ${CUDA_SOURCE_FILE}\n       COMMENT \"Generating PTX file: ${PTX_OUTPUT_FILE}\"\n   )\n\n   # Custom target that depends on the PTX file\n   add_custom_target(\n       generate_ptx ALL\n       DEPENDS ${PTX_OUTPUT_FILE}\n   )\n   ```\n\n3. **Explanation:**\n   - **CUDA_SOURCE_FILE:** This variable holds the path to your input `.cu` file.\n   - **PTX_OUTPUT_FILE:** This variable specifies the desired output filename with the `.ptx` extension.\n   - **add_custom_command:** This command runs NVCC directly, specifying the output filename using the `-o` option. The `DEPENDS` clause ensures that the PTX file is regenerated whenever the source file changes.\n   - **add_custom_target:** This creates a custom target that depends on the PTX file, ensuring that the PTX generation step is part of the build process.\n\nBy using this approach, you have full control over the output filename of the PTX file generated from your CUDA source file. Adjust the paths and filenames as necessary for your specific project structure."
