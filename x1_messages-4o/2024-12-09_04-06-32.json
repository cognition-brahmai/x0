        "content": "To import a module from a parent directory in Python, you can modify the Python path at runtime or use relative imports if the files are organized as packages. Here are a couple of ways to achieve this:\n\n### Method 1: Modify the Python Path\n\nYou can modify the `sys.path` to include the parent directory where the module you want to import resides. Add the following code in the beginning of `Script B`:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport os\n\n# Get the parent directory\nparent_dir = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..'))\n\n# Add the parent directory to the system path\nsys.path.insert(0, parent_dir)\n\n# Now you can import Script A\nimport scriptA\n```\n\n### Method 2: Use Relative Imports (if inside a package)\n\nIf your scripts are part of a package, you can use relative imports. Ensure that `Folder A` is recognized as a package (which it is, since it contains an `__init__.py` file). In `Script B`, you can use:\n\n```python\nfrom .. import scriptA\n```\n\nNote that relative imports will only work if you are running the script as a part of a package (e.g., using `python -m`). Running the script directly like `python scriptB.py` will not work with relative imports.\n\n### Important Notes:\n\n1. **Running as a Package**: For relative imports to work, you should run your script as a module. For instance, navigate to `Folder A` and run the following:\n   ```bash\n   python -m FolderB.scriptB\n   ```\n\n2. **Script Execution Context**: If you execute `Script B` directly from the command line, Python might not recognize it as part of a package. Use the `-m` switch as shown above.\n\n3. **Organizing Code**: If the directory structure becomes more complex, consider restructuring your code into a more standard package/module layout for better maintainability.\n\nBy using one of these methods, you should be able to import `Script A` into `Script B` successfully."
