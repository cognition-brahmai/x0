I am converting old Python code from using os.path to pathlib for path-related operations. Previously, I added the extension with simple string operations like `newpath = path + '.res'`. This doesn't work with pathlib.Path because it doesn't allow concatenation of arbitrary characters. The closest I have found is `newpath = path.with_suffix(path.suffix + '.res')`, but this still uses string addition and doesn't seem to be an idiomatic solution. Is there a better way to add a new extension to a path using pathlib?"

        "content": "When using `pathlib`, you can achieve the addition of an extra suffix to a path in a more idiomatic way by combining the `.with_suffix()` method with careful handling of the existing suffix. Since pathlib doesn't directly support appending arbitrary suffixes without replacing the existing one, you can construct a new path by considering both the existing part of the path and the desired additional suffix. Here's a way to do it:\n\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# Original path\npath = Path(\"example.txt\")\n\n# Add another suffix\nnew_suffix = \".res\"\nnewpath = path.with_name(path.name + new_suffix)\n\nprint(newpath)  # Output: example.txt.res\n```\n\nIn this approach:\n\n1. `path.name` retrieves the last part of the path, including the existing suffix.\n2. You concatenate the desired new suffix to `path.name`.\n3. `with_name()` creates a new `Path` object with the modified name.\n\nThis method avoids directly manipulating the suffix as a string and utilizes `pathlib` functions to construct the path. Note that this approach is effective when you want to preserve the original suffix and simply append an additional one."
