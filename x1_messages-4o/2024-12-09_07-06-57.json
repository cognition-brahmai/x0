I have been encountering a problem where spaces are being introduced into my field, which is an issue I plan to address separately. However, I want my logic to function correctly regardless. When I use `{% if lesson.assignment %}`, it always passes even though I don't want it to when the string only contains spaces. I've been searching for a trimming functionality to use within `{% %}` but have had no luck. I've tried `strip`, but it doesn't seem to work within `{% %}`. Can anyone provide guidance on how to solve this issue?"

        "content": "In Django templates, you don't have direct access to Python's string methods like `strip()`, which can make handling such scenarios a bit tricky. However, you can use a combination of template filters and custom template tags to achieve the desired logic.\n\nHere's how you can handle this situation:\n\n### Using Built-in Template Filters\n\nYou can use the `default_if_none` filter and `yesno` filter to help deal with `None` values, but for trimming strings, you'll need a custom solution. Here's a simple way to check if a variable is an empty string or contains only spaces by using a custom template filter.\n\n### Create a Custom Template Filter\n\n1. **Create a Template Filter**\n\n   First, you'll need to create a custom template filter that can trim the whitespace from your variable. You can do this by creating a custom Django app if you don't already have one, or simply adding a `templatetags` directory to your existing app.\n\n   Create a file named `custom_filters.py` inside the `templatetags` directory of your app:\n\n   ```\n   your_app/\n       templatetags/\n           __init__.py\n           custom_filters.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Add the Custom Filter Logic**\n\n   In `custom_filters.py`, add the following code to define a custom filter to trim spaces and check for empty content:\n\n   ```python\n   from django import template\n\n   register = template.Library()\n\n   @register.filter(name='trimmed_empty')\n   def trimmed_empty(value):\n       return (value or '').strip() == ''\n   ```\n\n3. **Load the Custom Filter in Your Template**\n\n   In your Django template, load the custom filter and use it in your `{% if %}` statement:\n\n   ```html\n   {% load custom_filters %}\n\n   {% if not lesson.assignment|trimmed_empty %}\n       <!-- Display content -->\n   {% else %}\n       <!-- Handle empty or space-only content -->\n   {% endif %}\n   ```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- The `trimmed_empty` filter strips any leading and trailing whitespace from the `lesson.assignment` variable and checks if the resulting string is empty.\n- By using `{% if not lesson.assignment|trimmed_empty %}`, you ensure that your logic only passes when the variable is not empty or does not contain only spaces.\n\nThis approach allows you to effectively handle null, empty strings, or strings containing only spaces within your Django templates."
