However, I am running into an issue when I try to execute my code. Here is what I have written so far:\n\n```python\nimport datetime \n\ntod = datetime.datetime.now()\nd = timedelta(days = 50)\na = tod - d\n```\n\nWhen I run this, I get the following error:\n\n```\nType Error : unsupported operand type for - : \"datetime.timedelta\" and \"datetime.datetime\" \n```\n\nHow can I resolve this error and achieve my goal of finding the date from a certain number of days ago?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to a missing `datetime` reference when you create the `timedelta` object. You need to specify `datetime.timedelta` instead of just `timedelta`. Here's the corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ntod = datetime.datetime.now()\nd = datetime.timedelta(days=50)\na = tod - d\n\nprint(\"Date 50 days ago was:\", a)\n```\n\nThis should resolve the error and correctly calculate the date from 50 days ago. The key fix is ensuring you're using `datetime.timedelta` to create the `timedelta` object."
