Your goal is to programmatically replace all instances of that word with a different one using C# code. \nTo do so, you will need to first identify the books that contain the word and then replace the word in each of those books. However, you cannot simply replace the word in the entire book as it may appear in different contexts (e.g., as part of a larger word or in a title). \nYour program must be able to identify the specific instances of the word and replace only those instances with the new word. Can you provide a sample implementation to accomplish this task?"

        "content": "Certainly! To achieve this task in C#, we'll need to perform several steps:\n\n1. **Identify Books Containing the Word**: First, scan through each book to identify which ones contain the specific word.\n2. **Replace Specific Instances**: Within the identified books, replace only the specific instances of the word, ensuring not to replace parts of larger words.\n3. **Output the Modified Books**: Save or display the modified content.\n\nHere is a sample implementation using C#:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.IO;\nusing System.Text.RegularExpressions;\n\nclass LibraryWordReplacer\n{\n    static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        string directoryPath = @\"path\\to\\library\"; // Path to the directory containing books\n        string targetWord = \"oldWord\"; // Word to be replaced\n        string replacementWord = \"newWord\"; // New word to replace with\n\n        // Get all book files (assuming text files for simplicity)\n        string[] bookFiles = Directory.GetFiles(directoryPath, \"*.txt\");\n        \n        foreach (string filePath in bookFiles)\n        {\n            string content = File.ReadAllText(filePath);\n            \n            // Check if the book contains the target word\n            if (ContainsWholeWord(content, targetWord))\n            {\n                // Replace only the whole word instances\n                string modifiedContent = ReplaceWholeWord(content, targetWord, replacementWord);\n                \n                // Save the modified content back to the file (or handle as needed)\n                File.WriteAllText(filePath, modifiedContent);\n                \n                Console.WriteLine($\"Processed: {Path.GetFileName(filePath)}\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Method to check if the content contains the whole word\n    static bool ContainsWholeWord(string content, string word)\n    {\n        return Regex.IsMatch(content, $@\"\\b{Regex.Escape(word)}\\b\");\n    }\n\n    // Method to replace whole word instances\n    static string ReplaceWholeWord(string content, string word, string replacement)\n    {\n        return Regex.Replace(content, $@\"\\b{Regex.Escape(word)}\\b\", replacement);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Reading Files**: The program reads text files from a specified directory. You can change the file extension if your books are in a different format.\n  \n- **Regex for Whole Words**: The `ContainsWholeWord` and `ReplaceWholeWord` methods use regular expressions to identify and replace only whole word instances. The `\\b` in the regex pattern represents a word boundary, ensuring that only standalone instances of the word are matched.\n\n- **File Handling**: After modifying the content, it writes the changes back to the file. You can adjust this to save to a new file or handle the output differently as needed.\n\nThis implementation is a basic example and may need adjustments based on the specific requirements and structure of your library (e.g., file formats, encoding, etc.)."
