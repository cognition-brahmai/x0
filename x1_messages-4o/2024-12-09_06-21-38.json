However, I understand that Python does not have absolute private functions. I am looking for the most used or most efficient styles to distinguish between these \"public\" and \"private\" functions. Currently, I am considering using the `__all__` in the module file to indicate its \"public\" functions or using an underscore at the beginning of the name of \"private\" functions. Can anyone suggest any other ideas or conventions that are typically employed for this purpose?"

        "content": "In Python, differentiating between \"public\" and \"private\" functions is largely a matter of convention rather than enforcement, given the language's philosophy of \"we are all consenting adults here.\" Here are the most common conventions and techniques you can use:\n\n1. **Underscore Prefix**: Prefixing a function or variable name with a single underscore (`_`) is the most common convention to indicate that it is intended for internal use only. This is widely recognized by Python developers as a signal that such functions or variables are not part of the public API.\n\n   ```python\n   def _private_function():\n       # This function is intended for internal use\n       pass\n   ```\n\n2. **Double Underscore Prefix (Name Mangling)**: Using a double underscore prefix (`__`) triggers name mangling, which changes the name of the attribute to include the class name. This makes it harder to accidentally override or access these methods or attributes, but they are still accessible if needed.\n\n   ```python\n   class MyClass:\n       def __private_method(self):\n           # This method is intended to be private\n           pass\n   ```\n\n3. **`__all__` Declaration**: Defining an `__all__` list in your module specifies which functions and variables should be considered public when `from module import *` is used. This doesn't prevent access to other functions or variables, but it does indicate your intended public API.\n\n   ```python\n   __all__ = ['public_function']\n\n   def public_function():\n       pass\n\n   def _private_function():\n       pass\n   ```\n\n4. **Documentation and Naming Conventions**: Clear documentation and consistent naming are crucial. Document which parts of your API are public and which are internal. Use naming conventions that make it clear which parts of the code are for internal use.\n\n5. **Modules and Submodules**: Organize your code into modules and submodules to separate public interfaces from internal details. This can help structure your code in a way that makes the distinction clearer.\n\n6. **Use of Properties**: For classes, you can use property decorators to control access to private variables, providing a public interface while keeping the variables themselves private.\n\n   ```python\n   class MyClass:\n       def __init__(self):\n           self._private_var = 0\n\n       @property\n       def public_var(self):\n           return self._private_var\n   ```\n\nBy following these conventions, you can clearly signal your intentions to other developers and maintain a clean and understandable codebase."
