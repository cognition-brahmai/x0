However, when I try to annotate the function with `Tuple[str]`, I receive error messages indicating that the argument provided to `process_tuple` is incompatible with the expected \"Tuple[str]\". Here's the function and the errors:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Tuple\n\ndef process_tuple(t: Tuple[str]):\n    # Do nasty tuple stuff\n\nprocess_tuple((\"a\",))\nprocess_tuple((\"a\", \"b\"))\nprocess_tuple((\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"))\n```\n\nError messages:\n```python\nfool.py:9: error: Argument 1 to \"process_tuple\" has incompatible type \"Tuple[str, str]\"; expected \"Tuple[str]\"\nfool.py:10: error: Argument 1 to \"process_tuple\" has incompatible type \"Tuple[str, str, str]\"; expected \"Tuple[str]\"\n```\n\nI'm using tuples here as I need them to be immutable lists of variable length. I haven't found any clear solution on how I should annotate this kind of input. Could you please help me with how to annotate a function that takes a tuple of variable length?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to how the `Tuple` type hint works in Python's typing module. When you specify `Tuple[str]`, it indicates a tuple with exactly one string element. If you want to annotate a function that accepts a tuple of variable length, where each element is a string, you should use `Tuple[str, ...]`. The `...` (ellipsis) indicates that the tuple can have any number of elements, all of type `str`.\n\nHere's how you can modify your function annotation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Tuple\n\ndef process_tuple(t: Tuple[str, ...]):\n    # Do nasty tuple stuff\n    pass\n\nprocess_tuple((\"a\",))\nprocess_tuple((\"a\", \"b\"))\nprocess_tuple((\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"))\n```\n\nWith this change, your function will accept tuples of varying lengths, as long as all the elements in the tuple are strings. This should resolve the errors you're seeing."
