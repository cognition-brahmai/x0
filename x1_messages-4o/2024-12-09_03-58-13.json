I am working with two objects: Films and Directors, which have a many-to-many relationship as defined in the model. In the detail form for a Film object, I want to be able to add inline Director objects and create new ones, not just select existing instances. I have defined DirectorInline as an admin.TabularInline but this throws an error because it expects a foreign key on the Director object. Is it possible to achieve this without creating a custom form or validator?\n\nHere is my code:\n\n```python\nclass Film(Model):\n    director = ManyToManyField('Director')\n\nclass DirectorInline(admin.TabularInline):\n    model = Director\n    extra = 3\n\nclass FilmAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    inlines = (\n        DirectorInline,\n        )\n```"

        "content": "In Django, when you have a many-to-many relationship and you want to manage the related objects directly from the admin interface, you need to use an intermediary model to represent this relationship. This is because the `TabularInline` class requires a foreign key relationship, which isn't directly possible with a many-to-many field. By introducing an intermediary model, you can create inline forms for the related objects.\n\nHere's how you can restructure your models and admin configuration to achieve the desired functionality:\n\n### Models\n\nFirst, define an intermediary model to represent the many-to-many relationship between `Film` and `Director`:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass Director(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    \n    def __str__(self):\n        return self.name\n\nclass Film(models.Model):\n    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    directors = models.ManyToManyField('Director', through='FilmDirector')\n    \n    def __str__(self):\n        return self.title\n\nclass FilmDirector(models.Model):\n    film = models.ForeignKey(Film, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n    director = models.ForeignKey(Director, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n```\n\n### Admin\n\nNext, configure the Django admin to use the intermediary model for inline editing:\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom .models import Film, Director, FilmDirector\n\nclass FilmDirectorInline(admin.TabularInline):\n    model = FilmDirector\n    extra = 1\n\nclass FilmAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    inlines = [FilmDirectorInline]\n\nadmin.site.register(Film, FilmAdmin)\nadmin.site.register(Director)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Intermediary Model (`FilmDirector`)**: This model acts as a bridge between `Film` and `Director`, allowing you to manage the many-to-many relationship with additional fields if needed.\n\n- **Admin Configuration**: By using `FilmDirector` as the model for `FilmDirectorInline`, you can now add and manage director instances directly from the `Film` admin page.\n\n- **Register Models**: Ensure that both `Film` and `Director` models are registered with the admin site.\n\nWith this setup, you'll be able to add new director instances and associate them with a film directly from the film's admin detail page."
