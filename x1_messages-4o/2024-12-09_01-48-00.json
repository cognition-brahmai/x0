Currently, when I use the re.split('\\W', 'foo/bar spam\\neggs') method, it returns ['foo', 'bar', 'spam', 'eggs']. However, I want it to return ['foo', '/', 'bar', ' ', 'spam', '\\n', 'eggs']. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To achieve splitting a string into tokens while keeping the separators, you can use capturing groups in the regular expression. By placing parentheses around the separator pattern, `re.split` will include the separators in the resulting list. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Original string\nstring = 'foo/bar spam\\neggs'\n\n# Split the string with capturing groups to keep the separators\ntokens = re.split(r'(\\W)', string)\n\n# Remove any empty strings from the result\ntokens = [token for token in tokens if token]\n\nprint(tokens)\n```\n\nHere's what happens in this code:\n\n- The regular expression `(\\W)` captures any non-word character as a group. This causes `re.split` to include these separators in the resulting list.\n- The list comprehension `[token for token in tokens if token]` is used to filter out any empty strings that may result from consecutive non-word characters or leading/trailing non-word characters.\n\nRunning this code will give you the desired output:\n\n```\n['foo', '/', 'bar', ' ', 'spam', '\\n', 'eggs']\n```"
