I am following the celery tutorial and trying to duplicate everything with slightly modified names/queues, but I am encountering errors. I tried to change all instances of tasks to blue_tasks or red_tasks, but when I queue blue_tasks, the red_tasks workers start trying to work on them. I also attempted to use default queues with the following code, but it didn't work:\n\n```python\nCELERY_DEFAULT_QUEUE = 'red'\nCELERY_QUEUES = (\n    Queue('red', Exchange('red'), routing_key='red'),\n)\n```\nAdditionally, I am confused about why `celery worker` errors out with celery attempting to connect to a default amqp instance, while `celery -A tasks worker` instructs celery to connect to Redis. What task code is `celery worker` trying to run on the worker if nothing has been specified?"

        "content": "To maintain multiple independent Celery queues with distinct tasks and workers in the same Redis database, you need to ensure that each queue is properly defined and that each worker is configured to listen only to its designated queue. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Define Separate Queues**: You need to define separate queues for each type of task. This can be done in your Celery configuration.\n\n   ```python\n   from kombu import Exchange, Queue\n\n   app.conf.task_queues = (\n       Queue('red', Exchange('red'), routing_key='red'),\n       Queue('blue', Exchange('blue'), routing_key='blue'),\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. **Assign Tasks to Queues**: When defining your tasks, assign each task to the appropriate queue using the `@task` decorator.\n\n   ```python\n   @app.task(queue='red')\n   def red_task():\n       # Red task implementation\n       pass\n\n   @app.task(queue='blue')\n   def blue_task():\n       # Blue task implementation\n       pass\n   ```\n\n3. **Configure Workers to Listen to Specific Queues**: Start your workers with the `-Q` option to specify which queue they should listen to.\n\n   For the red worker:\n   ```bash\n   celery -A your_project worker -Q red -n red_worker@%h\n   ```\n\n   For the blue worker:\n   ```bash\n   celery -A your_project worker -Q blue -n blue_worker@%h\n   ```\n\n4. **Ensure Correct Celery Command**: When you run `celery worker` without specifying an application (`-A`), Celery defaults to using its built-in broker (amqp). Always specify the application module where Celery is instantiated.\n\n   You'll need to run it like:\n   ```bash\n   celery -A tasks worker\n   ```\n\n   This command specifies that Celery should use the configuration found in `tasks.py` (or whatever your module is named), which should include the broker URL for Redis.\n\n5. **Verify Configuration**: Double-check that your Celery configuration (often in a `celeryconfig.py` or directly in your main module) includes the correct broker URL for Redis. It should look something like this:\n\n   ```python\n   app.conf.broker_url = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to maintain separate queues and workers, each handling only its designated tasks. Make sure that the routing and task definitions are consistent and that each worker is correctly configured to listen only to its assigned queue."
