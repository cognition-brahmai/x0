        "content": "To achieve this, you can use Click's `Context` object to invoke other commands from within a command. The `Context` object provides a method called `invoke`, which allows you to call another command while properly passing arguments and options. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can use the `click` library to call a command from within another command without encountering the unexpected arguments error:\n\n1. Define your individual commands: `add_name` and `add_surname`.\n2. Define the `add_name_and_surname` command to call the other two commands using `ctx.invoke()`.\n3. Group all these commands using a Click `Group`.\n\nHere's a complete example:\n\n```python\nimport click\n\n@click.group()\ndef cli():\n    \"\"\"Main CLI group.\"\"\"\n    pass\n\n@click.command()\n@click.argument('name')\ndef add_name(name):\n    \"\"\"Add a name.\"\"\"\n    click.echo(f\"Adding name: {name}\")\n\n@click.command()\n@click.argument('surname')\ndef add_surname(surname):\n    \"\"\"Add a surname.\"\"\"\n    click.echo(f\"Adding surname: {surname}\")\n\n@click.command()\n@click.argument('name')\n@click.argument('surname')\n@click.pass_context\ndef add_name_and_surname(ctx, name, surname):\n    \"\"\"Add name and surname.\"\"\"\n    # Invoke the add_name command\n    ctx.invoke(add_name, name=name)\n    # Invoke the add_surname command\n    ctx.invoke(add_surname, surname=surname)\n\n# Add commands to the main CLI group\ncli.add_command(add_name)\ncli.add_command(add_surname)\ncli.add_command(add_name_and_surname)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    cli()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- `@click.group()` is used to define the main command group which acts as a container for other commands.\n- `@click.command()` is used to define individual commands: `add_name`, `add_surname`, and `add_name_and_surname`.\n- `ctx.invoke(command, **kwargs)` is used to invoke a command from within another command. You pass the command object and its arguments as keyword arguments.\n- `@click.pass_context` is a decorator that passes the Click context object to the command, allowing you to use `ctx.invoke()`.\n\nWith this setup, you can call `add_name_and_surname` from the command line, and it will internally call the `add_name` and `add_surname` commands with the appropriate arguments."
