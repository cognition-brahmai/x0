I have tried a nested for loop, which works well in a simple Python script, but in the Jinja template, it splits each element into multiple characters. Here is my attempt:\n\nPython code:\n```python\nlist1 = [{\"username\": \"abhi\", \"pass\": 2087}]\nreturn render_template(\"file_output.html\", list1=list1)\n```\n\nJinja template:\n```html\n<table border=2>\n  <tr>\n    <td>\n      Key\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      Value\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  {% for dictionary in list1 %}\n    {% for key in dictionary %}\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <h3>{{ key }}</h3>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <h3>{{ dictionary[key] }}</h3>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n    {% endfor %}\n  {% endfor %}\n</table>\n```\n\nBut the output I am getting is splitting each element into multiple characters like this:\n\n```python\n[\n\n{\n\n\"\n\nu\n\ns\n\ne\n\nr\n\n...\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is likely due to an error in how the data is being rendered or processed in the Jinja template. However, your Jinja template code seems correct for iterating over a list of dictionaries. Let's ensure everything is set up properly.\n\nHere's a revised version of your setup:\n\n### Python Code\nMake sure you are passing the `list1` correctly to the template. Your Python code looks fine, but just to confirm:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef index():\n    list1 = [{\"username\": \"abhi\", \"pass\": 2087}]\n    return render_template(\"file_output.html\", list1=list1)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n### Jinja Template\nYour Jinja template should correctly iterate over each dictionary and then each key-value pair within the dictionary. Here's the correct structure:\n\n```html\n<table border=\"2\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Key</th>\n    <th>Value</th>\n  </tr>\n  {% for dictionary in list1 %}\n    {% for key, value in dictionary.items() %}\n      <tr>\n        <td><h3>{{ key }}</h3></td>\n        <td><h3>{{ value }}</h3></td>\n      </tr>\n    {% endfor %}\n  {% endfor %}\n</table>\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Use `.items()`**: Make sure to use `.items()` when iterating over a dictionary in Jinja. This method returns both the key and the value, which is more efficient and clearer.\n\n2. **HTML Structure**: Ensure that your HTML structure is correct. Using `<th>` for table headers and `<td>` for table data is a good practice.\n\n3. **Debugging**: If the issue persists, try printing the `list1` before rendering to ensure it's being passed correctly. Also, make sure there are no additional scripts or content modifying the output after rendering.\n\nIf you follow these steps, you should see your data displayed correctly in a table format. If there's still an issue, it might be related to how the data is being processed before it reaches the template, or a separate issue in your application setup."
