I tried to remove CUDA using the command `sudo apt-get remove --auto-remove nvidia-cuda-toolkit`, but I encountered some unmet dependencies errors. I then tried to run 'apt --fix-broken install', but I received another error. How can I completely remove CUDA from my system?"

        "content": "To completely remove CUDA from your Ubuntu system and resolve any dependency issues, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **List Installed CUDA Packages:**\n\n   First, identify all CUDA-related packages installed on your system. You can do this with:\n\n   ```bash\n   dpkg -l | grep cuda\n   ```\n\n   This will list all packages related to CUDA.\n\n2. **Remove CUDA Packages:**\n\n   Remove all CUDA-related packages. You can use the `dpkg` command to remove them:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo dpkg --purge <package-name>\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<package-name>` with the names of the packages listed in the previous step.\n\n3. **Remove NVIDIA Packages:**\n\n   Similarly, list and remove any NVIDIA packages:\n\n   ```bash\n   dpkg -l | grep nvidia\n   ```\n\n   And remove them with:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo dpkg --purge <package-name>\n   ```\n\n4. **Clean Up Residual Configurations:**\n\n   After removing the packages, clean up any residual configuration files:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get autoremove --purge\n   sudo apt-get clean\n   ```\n\n5. **Fix Broken Dependencies:**\n\n   Attempt to fix any broken dependencies again:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install -f\n   ```\n\n6. **Verify Removal:**\n\n   Again, check if any CUDA or NVIDIA packages remain:\n\n   ```bash\n   dpkg -l | grep cuda\n   dpkg -l | grep nvidia\n   ```\n\n7. **Remove CUDA Repository:**\n\n   If you added a CUDA repository to your system, remove it from your sources list. You can do this by editing the file:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list\n   ```\n\n   Look for any lines related to CUDA and remove them.\n\n8. **Reboot:**\n\n   Finally, reboot your system to ensure all changes take effect.\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo reboot\n   ```\n\nAfter rebooting, you can proceed to install the correct version of CUDA for TensorFlow-GPU. Make sure to follow the official installation instructions to avoid any compatibility issues."
