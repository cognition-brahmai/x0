Below is a Java code snippet that finds the two largest values from an array of integers:\n\n```java\npublic class FindTwoLargest {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int[] arr = {4, 10, 5, 9, 7};\n        findTwoLargest(arr);\n    }\n\n    public static void findTwoLargest(int[] arr) {\n        if (arr == null || arr.length < 2) {\n            System.out.println(\"Array should have at least two elements\");\n            return;\n        }\n        \n        int largest = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\n        int secondLargest = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\n\n        for (int value : arr) {\n            if (value > largest) {\n                secondLargest = largest;\n                largest = value;\n            } else if (value > secondLargest && value != largest) {\n                secondLargest = value;\n            }\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(\"The two largest values are: \" + largest + \" and \" + secondLargest);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. The code first checks if the array is null or has fewer than two elements, as it can't find two distinct largest numbers in such cases.\n2. It initializes two variables, `largest` and `secondLargest`, with the smallest possible integer value.\n3. It iterates over the array, updating `largest` and `secondLargest` as needed:\n   - If the current element is greater than `largest`, it updates `secondLargest` to be `largest`, and `largest` to be the current element.\n   - If the current element is greater than `secondLargest` and not equal to `largest`, it updates `secondLargest`.\n\nThis code will output the two largest distinct values from the provided array."
