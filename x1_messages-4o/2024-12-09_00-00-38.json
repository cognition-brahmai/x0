The function must also check if any of the numbers in the array are prime numbers and exclude them from the calculation of the sum. Additionally, the function must output the sum in a table format, with each number in the array and its corresponding sum in a separate row of the table. Lastly, the function should be able to handle arrays with up to 10,000 elements without crashing or causing any performance issues."

        "content": "To achieve the task described, we can create a JavaScript function that calculates the sum of an array of numbers, excluding any prime numbers. We'll also format the output in a table, displaying each number and the running total sum. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```javascript\nfunction isPrime(num) {\n    if (num <= 1) return false; // 0 and 1 are not prime numbers\n    if (num === 2) return true; // 2 is the only even prime number\n    if (num % 2 === 0) return false; // exclude even numbers\n\n    const sqrt = Math.sqrt(num);\n    for (let i = 3; i <= sqrt; i += 2) {\n        if (num % i === 0) return false;\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n\nfunction calculateSumExcludingPrimes(arr) {\n    let sum = 0;\n    console.log(\"Number\\tSum\");\n\n    arr.forEach((number, index) => {\n        if (!isPrime(number)) {\n            sum += number;\n        }\n        console.log(`${number}\\t${sum}`);\n    });\n\n    return sum;\n}\n\n// Example usage\nconst numbers = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];\nconst totalSum = calculateSumExcludingPrimes(numbers);\nconsole.log(`Total Sum (excluding primes): ${totalSum}`);\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **isPrime Function**: This helper function checks if a number is prime. It does so by checking several conditions:\n   - Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime.\n   - Number 2 is prime.\n   - Even numbers greater than 2 are not prime.\n   - For other numbers, it checks divisibility from 3 up to the square root of the number (only odd numbers).\n\n2. **calculateSumExcludingPrimes Function**:\n   - Initializes a variable `sum` to accumulate the total sum.\n   - Iterates through each number in the array.\n   - For each number, it checks if it is not prime using the `isPrime` function.\n   - If the number is not prime, it adds it to the `sum`.\n   - Prints each number and the current sum in a tabulated format.\n   - Returns the total sum after processing the array.\n\n3. **Performance**: The solution is efficient enough to handle arrays with up to 10,000 elements due to the use of the square root method for prime checking, which significantly reduces the number of checks needed for each number."
