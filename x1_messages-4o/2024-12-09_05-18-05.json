I have a repeating pattern in my methods and I want to use a decorator to handle this. However, the decorator needs to access some attributes of the current instance, so I want to define it as a method within the class. I am currently having issues implementing this. Here's an example of what I am trying to achieve:\n\n```python\nclass DullRepetitiveClass:\n    def __init__(self, nicevariable):\n        self.nicevariable = nicevariable\n\n    def mydecorator(self, myfunction):\n        def call(*args, **kwargs):\n            print \"Hi! The value of nicevariable is %s\"%(self.nicevariable,)\n            return myfunction(*args, **kwargs)\n        return call\n\n    @mydecorator            \n    def somemethod(self, x):\n        return x + 1\n```\nI want to use the `DullRepetitiveClass.mydecorator` method to decorate the `somemethod` method. But I am not sure how to use the method from the current instance as the decorator. Is there a simple way to accomplish this?"

        "content": "Yes, you can use a method within a class as a decorator for another method of the same class. However, the method you want to use as a decorator needs to be accessible at the time of class definition, and it needs to be instantiated properly to have access to instance attributes. One way to achieve this is by defining the decorator as a static method or a class method, but since you want to access instance attributes, you can define the decorator normally and apply it in the `__init__` method after the instance is created. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nclass DullRepetitiveClass:\n    def __init__(self, nicevariable):\n        self.nicevariable = nicevariable\n        # Apply the decorator after the instance is created\n        self.somemethod = self.mydecorator(self.somemethod)\n\n    def mydecorator(self, myfunction):\n        def call(*args, **kwargs):\n            print(\"Hi! The value of nicevariable is %s\" % (self.nicevariable,))\n            return myfunction(*args, **kwargs)\n        return call\n\n    def somemethod(self, x):\n        return x + 1\n\n# Example usage\nobj = DullRepetitiveClass(\"awesome\")\nprint(obj.somemethod(5))  # Output will include the print statement from the decorator\n```\n\nIn this implementation:\n- The `mydecorator` method is defined as a normal method that can access the instance attributes.\n- The `somemethod` is decorated after the instance is created inside the `__init__` method. This ensures that the decorator has access to the instance (`self`) and can use the `nicevariable` attribute.\n- Note that this approach decorates `somemethod` for each instance individually, which is usually fine unless you have a specific reason to avoid it."
