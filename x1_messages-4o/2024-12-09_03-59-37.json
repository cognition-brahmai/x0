I have a variable `percentage_chance` set to 0.36 and I want to create a function such that when I pass this variable into the function, the action inside the function has a 36% chance to execute. How can I write this function or an expression involving `percentage_chance` to solve this problem? \n\n```python\npercentage_chance = 0.36\n\nif some_function(percentage_chance):\n   # action here has 36% chance to execute\n   pass\n```"

        "content": "To achieve this, you can use Python's `random` module to generate a random float between 0 and 1, and then compare it to your `percentage_chance`. If the generated random number is less than or equal to `percentage_chance`, you execute the action. Here\u2019s how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef some_function(percentage_chance):\n    return random.random() <= percentage_chance\n\npercentage_chance = 0.36\n\nif some_function(percentage_chance):\n    # action here has 36% chance to execute\n    print(\"Action executed!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Action not executed.\")\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- `random.random()` generates a random float between 0.0 and 1.0.\n- The function `some_function` returns `True` if the generated random number is less than or equal to `percentage_chance`, giving you a 36% chance of executing the action when `percentage_chance` is 0.36."
