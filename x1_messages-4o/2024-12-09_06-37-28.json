This tool would need to have functionalities such as growl notifications or other callbacks when tests break or pass. If not, what would be the easiest way to create such a tool? Additionally, how do you determine which functions have changed between two revisions of a script and is it possible to determine which functions a command will call, somewhat like a reverse traceback?"

        "content": "For Python, there are a few tools that provide functionalities similar to Ruby's 'autotest':\n\n1. **pytest-watch (pytest-watch)**: This is a simple tool that watches your project and runs your tests whenever a file changes. You can pair it with plugins like `pytest-notifications` to get desktop notifications.\n\n2. **Nose2**: Nose2 is an extension of the unittest framework and offers plugins to handle file watching and notifications.\n\n3. **Watchdog with unittest**: You can set up a custom script using the `watchdog` library to watch for file changes and then run your unittests. By integrating with a notification library like `pynotifier` or using system notifications, you can achieve a similar effect to growl notifications.\n\n4. **Tox**: While not specifically for watching files, Tox can be used in combination with file watchers to automate testing in different environments.\n\nTo create such a tool manually, you can use Python's `watchdog` library to monitor file changes and run a script that executes the tests and sends notifications depending on the results.\n\nRegarding determining which functions have changed between two revisions, you can use a version control tool like `git` to diff files. For a finer granularity, tools like `pylint` or `flake8` can help identify changes in specific functions. However, they don't directly support diffing between two revisions.\n\nFor determining which functions a command will call (somewhat like a reverse traceback), you can use:\n\n1. **Call Graph Generators**: Tools like `pycallgraph` or `SnakeViz` can visualize the call graph of your application, helping you see which functions are being called during execution.\n\n2. **Static Analysis**: Tools like `pylint` can analyze your code statically to provide a rough idea of function calls, but they may not capture dynamic calls effectively.\n\n3. **Manual Inspection**: Sometimes, manual code inspection or adding logging can be necessary to understand the flow of function calls for complex or dynamic code paths.\n\nBy combining these tools and techniques, you can achieve a workflow similar to Ruby's 'autotest' and gain a deeper understanding of function changes and call hierarchies in your Python projects."
