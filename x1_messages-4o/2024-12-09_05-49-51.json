        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that the version of Python being used by `virtualenv` is not compatible with your system, and it appears that your environment is set up to use an older version of Python (2.6). Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Update Python**: Python 2.6 is quite outdated, and many tools, including `virtualenv`, may not support it. Consider updating to a more recent version of Python, such as Python 3.x. You can download and install the latest version from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Adjust PATH and PYTHONPATH**: After installing a new version of Python, you should update your `PATH` and `PYTHONPATH` to point to the new version.\n\n   - Update `PATH` by adding the new Python installation directory. You can do this by editing your `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bashrc`, or `~/.zshrc` file (depending on your shell) and add the following line:\n\n     ```bash\n     export PATH=\"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.x/bin:$PATH\"\n     ```\n\n     Replace `3.x` with the version you have installed.\n\n   - You can also update `PYTHONPATH` if necessary, but it's often not needed for typical Python usage.\n\n3. **Reinstall virtualenv**: Once you have updated Python, reinstall `virtualenv` using pip. You might need to upgrade pip first:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip\n   python3 -m pip install virtualenv\n   ```\n\n4. **Create a virtual environment**: Now, try creating a new virtual environment using the updated Python:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m virtualenv new_env\n   ```\n\n   Replace `new_env` with the desired name for your virtual environment.\n\n5. **Verify the setup**: Activate the virtual environment and verify the Python version:\n\n   ```bash\n   source new_env/bin/activate\n   python --version\n   ```\n\n   Make sure the Python version displayed is the one you installed.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the compatibility issue and successfully create a virtual environment on your Mac OS X."
