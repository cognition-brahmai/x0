I tried using `html_content()`, but I'm getting an error that says `AttributeError: 'lxml.etree._Element' object has no attribute 'html_content'`. Also, how can I get the text content inside a tag such as <p>text</p>?\n\nHere is the code I'm working with:\n\n```\nimg = house_tree.xpath('//img[@id=\"mainphoto\"]')[0]\n```"

        "content": "To extract the HTML content of an `lxml.etree._Element`, you can use the `lxml.etree.tostring()` function. This function converts the element and its content back to a string (which includes the HTML tags). To get the HTML content of an `<img>` tag, you can do the following:\n\n```python\nfrom lxml import etree\n\n# Assuming 'img' is your lxml.etree._Element for the <img> tag\nimg_html = etree.tostring(img, pretty_print=True, method=\"html\").decode('utf-8')\nprint(img_html)\n```\n\nThis will give you the HTML representation of the `<img>` element, including its attributes.\n\nTo get the text content inside a tag, such as `<p>text</p>`, you can access the `.text` attribute of an `lxml.etree._Element`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Assuming 'p_element' is your lxml.etree._Element for the <p> tag\np_element = house_tree.xpath('//p')[0]  # or any specific XPath to get your <p> element\np_text = p_element.text\nprint(p_text)\n```\n\nThe `.text` attribute will give you the text content directly inside the `<p>` tag. If the element contains nested tags and you want all the text content, including those nested within other tags, you can use the `.itertext()` method:\n\n```python\n# Get all the text content inside the <p> element, including nested tags\np_full_text = ''.join(p_element.itertext())\nprint(p_full_text)\n```\n\nThis will concatenate all the text content from the element and its children, giving you the complete text within the `<p>` tag."
