How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to a missing connection between the last `Dense` layer and the model's output. In the code you provided, you created the output layer using `Dense`, but you didn't connect it to the rest of the model. You need to pass the previous layer (`x`) as an input to the `output` layer.\n\nHere's the corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Model\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense, Flatten\n\ndef load_model(input_shape):\n    input = Input(shape=input_shape)\n    dense_shape = input_shape[0]\n    x = Flatten()(input)\n    x = Dense(dense_shape, activation='relu')(x)\n    x = Dense(dense_shape, activation='relu')(x)\n    x = Dense(dense_shape, activation='relu')(x)\n    x = Dense(dense_shape, activation='relu')(x)\n    x = Dense(dense_shape, activation='relu')(x)\n    output = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)  # Connect the output layer to x\n\n    model = Model(inputs=input, outputs=output)\n    model.summary()\n    return model\n\n# Call the model\nmodel = load_model((120,))\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, the `output` layer is now connected to the previous layer (`x`) by writing `output = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)`. Additionally, ensure that you specify `inputs=input` and `outputs=output` when creating the `Model` instance. This should resolve the error and allow your model to be built correctly."
