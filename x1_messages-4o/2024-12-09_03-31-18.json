        "content": "To format a `timedelta` object in Python to display the total hours and minutes, you can manually calculate the total number of hours and minutes from the `timedelta` and format it accordingly. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\n# Example timedelta object\ntd = timedelta(days=1, hours=2, minutes=30)\n\n# Calculate total hours and minutes\ntotal_seconds = int(td.total_seconds())\ntotal_hours = total_seconds // 3600\nremaining_seconds = total_seconds % 3600\nminutes = remaining_seconds // 60\n\n# Format the output as \"HH:MM\"\nformatted_time = f\"{total_hours}:{minutes:02d}\"\n\nprint(formatted_time)  # Output will be \"26:30\"\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We first calculate the total number of seconds in the `timedelta` using `td.total_seconds()`.\n- We then compute the total number of hours by dividing the total seconds by 3600 (the number of seconds in one hour).\n- The remaining seconds are found using the modulus operation, and from this, we calculate the number of minutes by dividing by 60.\n- Finally, we format the total hours and minutes into a string in the \"HH:MM\" format, ensuring that minutes are always displayed as two digits by using `:02d` for zero-padding."
