        "content": "When evaluating the performance of your PyTorch models on the validation set, you should actually use both `with torch.no_grad():` and `model.eval()`. They serve different purposes and are both important for proper evaluation.\n\n1. **`model.eval()`**: This method is called to set the model to evaluation mode. It changes the behavior of certain layers that have different behavior during training and evaluation, such as dropout layers and batch normalization layers. In evaluation mode, dropout is disabled, and batch normalization uses running statistics instead of batch statistics. This ensures that your model's behavior is consistent and deterministic during evaluation.\n\n2. **`with torch.no_grad():`**: This context manager is used to disable gradient computation. This is important during evaluation because it reduces memory consumption and speeds up computations. Since you don\u2019t need gradients when evaluating your model, using `torch.no_grad()` prevents PyTorch from tracking operations, which is necessary for gradient computations.\n\nHere's how you might typically use them together during evaluation:\n\n```python\nmodel.eval()  # Set the model to evaluation mode\nwith torch.no_grad():  # Disable gradient calculation\n    for inputs, labels in validation_loader:\n        outputs = model(inputs)\n        # Calculate loss and metrics\n```\n\nBy combining both `model.eval()` and `with torch.no_grad():`, you ensure that your model is in the correct mode for evaluation and that you are not using unnecessary resources for gradient calculations."
