My scripts 'foo.py' and 'bar.py' use the standard shebang and can be run with 'pipenv shell'. However, I have difficulty accessing the modules in 'src' from the scripts. I tried adding 'import src.baz as baz' to 'foo.py', but I get a 'ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src''. I tried adding a '.env' file to set the PYTHONPATH, but this clashes with the traditional use of '.env' to store secrets. Another solution I considered is moving 'src' under 'bin', but then the Jupyter notebook would have to reference the modules as 'bin.src.baz', which is not ideal. My current workaround is to add a symlink. Is there a more portable, distributable way to put these modules on the search path using 'pipenv'?"

        "content": "To resolve the issue of importing modules from the 'src' directory in your Python project while maintaining portability and compatibility with your existing setup, you can consider the following approaches:\n\n1. **Use `PYTHONPATH` in `pipenv`**: You can set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable within the `pipenv` environment specifically, without interfering with `.env` files used for secrets. This can be done by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   pipenv run python -c \"import sys; sys.path.append('src')\"\n   ```\n\n   This command ensures that the `src` directory is added to the Python search path when using `pipenv run`.\n\n2. **Modify `sys.path` in Scripts**: Another approach is to dynamically modify the `sys.path` in each of your scripts (`foo.py`, `bar.py`) to include the 'src' directory. This can be done at the beginning of the scripts:\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   import os\n\n   # Add the src directory to sys.path\n   sys.path.append(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '../src'))\n\n   import baz  # Now you can import modules from src\n   ```\n\n3. **Use a `setup.py` File**: If your project is intended to be a package itself, you could create a `setup.py` file in the root of your project and install the package in editable mode. This makes your modules accessible as a package:\n\n   ```python\n   from setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\n   setup(\n       name='your_project_name',\n       version='0.1',\n       packages=find_packages(where='src'),\n       package_dir={'': 'src'},\n   )\n   ```\n\n   You would then install this package in editable mode using:\n\n   ```bash\n   pipenv install -e .\n   ```\n\n   This approach is more suitable if you're distributing your project.\n\n4. **Symlink or Package Restructure**: While you mentioned using symlinks as a workaround, if restructuring is feasible, consider reorganizing your project such that all scripts and modules are under a single top-level package directory. This simplifies imports and avoids needing to modify `sys.path`.\n\n5. **Use `.pth` Files**: Place a `.pth` file in your `site-packages` directory within the `pipenv` environment to add the `src` directory to `sys.path`. This is a lesser-known approach but can be effective:\n\n   ```plaintext\n   # src.pth\n   /path/to/your/project/src\n   ```\n\nEach of these methods has its own trade-offs, so choose the one that best fits your project's goals and deployment strategy. If you plan to distribute the project widely, using `setup.py` with `find_packages` is a robust solution. For local development, modifying `sys.path` or using `.pth` files can be quick and effective."
