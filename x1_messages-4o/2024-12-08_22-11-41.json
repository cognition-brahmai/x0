These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction. AI can be categorized into two main types: narrow AI, which is designed and trained for a specific task, and general AI, which refers to systems that possess the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human can do. AI technologies include machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, and more."
