I would like to get a list of all variables in a class that's iterable. It should work similarly to the locals() function, but for a class instead. For instance, in the following class:\n\n```\nclass Example(object):\n    bool143 = True\n    bool2 = True\n    blah = False\n    foo = True\n    foobar2000 = False\n\n    def as_list(self)\n       ret = []\n       for field in XXX:\n           if getattr(self, field):\n               ret.append(field)\n       return \",\".join(ret)\n```\n\nI would like to execute the following commands:\n\n```\n>>> e = Example()\n>>> e.as_list()\n```\n\nAnd have it return `bool143, bool2, foo`. How can I go about achieving this?"

        "content": "To achieve this, you can leverage the `vars()` function or the `__dict__` attribute to access a dictionary of the class instance's namespace. However, since you're interested in class variables rather than instance variables, you'll want to access the class itself. In this case, you can use the `__dict__` attribute of the class to iterate over the class variables. Here's how you can implement the `as_list` method:\n\n```python\nclass Example(object):\n    bool143 = True\n    bool2 = True\n    blah = False\n    foo = True\n    foobar2000 = False\n\n    def as_list(self):\n        # Access the class's dictionary to get class variables\n        ret = []\n        for field, value in Example.__dict__.items():\n            # Check if the variable is a boolean and its value is True\n            if isinstance(value, bool) and value:\n                ret.append(field)\n        return \",\".join(ret)\n\n# Example usage:\ne = Example()\nprint(e.as_list())  # Output: bool143,bool2,foo\n```\n\nIn this solution, `Example.__dict__.items()` is used to retrieve all class variables and their values. We then filter these variables to include only those that are boolean and have a value of `True`. Finally, the matching field names are appended to the `ret` list, which is returned as a comma-separated string."
