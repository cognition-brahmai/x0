Below is a simple Rust program that counts the number of strings with more than 5 characters in a given list of strings.\n\n```rust\nfn count_long_strings(data: &[&str]) -> usize {\n    data.iter().filter(|&&s| s.len() > 5).count()\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let input_data = vec![\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\", \"elderberry\", \"fig\", \"grape\"];\n    let count = count_long_strings(&input_data);\n    println!(\"Number of strings with more than 5 characters: {}\", count);\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Function `count_long_strings`:** This function takes a slice of string slices (`&[&str]`) as input. It uses the iterator pattern to filter the strings that have a length greater than 5 and counts them.\n\n2. **Main function:** \n   - `input_data` is a vector of string slices. You can modify this vector with your input data.\n   - The `count_long_strings` function is called with `input_data`, and the result is stored in the variable `count`.\n   - Finally, the result is printed to the console.\n\nYou can run this program in a Rust environment, and it will output the number of strings with more than 5 characters from the provided input data."
