        "content": "To achieve normalization using Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) in Go, it's essential to ensure that no non-trivial functional dependencies exist, except those where the left side is a super key. In your provided example, the table `Employee` initially has partial dependencies due to the inclusion of both `DepartmentID` and `DepartmentName` in the same table, which violates BCNF. Your code separates these into two tables, `Employee` and `Department`, which is a step towards BCNF by ensuring that each table represents one entity and eliminates redundancy.\n\nThe normalization process is implemented in the `NormalizeTable` function in your code. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what it does:\n\n1. **Create New Tables**: It creates two new tables, `EmployeeNew` and `DepartmentNew`. The `EmployeeNew` table holds `EmployeeID`, `EmployeeName`, and `DepartmentID`, while `DepartmentNew` holds `DepartmentID` and `DepartmentName`.\n\n2. **Populate New Tables**: It populates `DepartmentNew` with distinct `DepartmentID` and `DepartmentName` combinations from the original `Employee` table. Then, it populates `EmployeeNew` with `EmployeeID`, `EmployeeName`, and the corresponding `DepartmentID` by joining with `DepartmentNew`.\n\n3. **Add Foreign Key Constraint**: It adds a foreign key constraint to `EmployeeNew` to ensure referential integrity between `EmployeeNew` and `DepartmentNew`.\n\n4. **Drop Old Tables**: It drops the original `Employee` and `Department` tables to remove redundancy.\n\n5. **Rename New Tables**: It renames `EmployeeNew` and `DepartmentNew` back to `Employee` and `Department`, respectively.\n\nHere's a more detailed look into the SQL queries and operations:\n\n- **Creating New Tables**:\n  ```sql\n  CREATE TABLE EmployeeNew(EmployeeID int, EmployeeName varchar(255), DepartmentID int, PRIMARY KEY(EmployeeID));\n  CREATE TABLE DepartmentNew(DepartmentID int, DepartmentName varchar(255), PRIMARY KEY(DepartmentID));\n  ```\n\n- **Inserting Distinct Departments**:\n  ```sql\n  INSERT INTO DepartmentNew SELECT DISTINCT DepartmentID, DepartmentName FROM Employee;\n  ```\n\n- **Populating EmployeeNew with Join**:\n  ```sql\n  INSERT INTO EmployeeNew SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName, DepartmentNew.DepartmentID FROM Employee JOIN DepartmentNew ON Employee.DepartmentID = DepartmentNew.DepartmentID;\n  ```\n\n- **Adding Foreign Key**:\n  ```sql\n  ALTER TABLE EmployeeNew ADD FOREIGN KEY(DepartmentID) REFERENCES DepartmentNew(DepartmentID);\n  ```\n\n- **Dropping Old Tables and Renaming**:\n  ```sql\n  DROP TABLE Employee;\n  DROP TABLE Department;\n  RENAME TABLE EmployeeNew TO Employee;\n  RENAME TABLE DepartmentNew TO Department;\n  ```\n\nThis process ensures that your data is normalized to BCNF, eliminating redundancy and potential update anomalies by ensuring that all functional dependencies have keys on the left side."
