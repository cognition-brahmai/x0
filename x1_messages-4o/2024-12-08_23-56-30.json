This example assumes you have access to these data sources, either through APIs or databases. Here\u2019s a step-by-step approach:\n\n### Step 1: Gather Data\nAssuming you have access to three data sources:\n- **User Ratings**: A database or API providing user ratings.\n- **Sales Figures**: A database or API providing sales data.\n- **Critical Reviews**: A database or API providing critical reviews.\n\n### Step 2: Database Setup\nFor demonstration purposes, let's assume you have a MySQL database with the following tables:\n- `books`: Contains book details.\n- `ratings`: Contains user ratings.\n- `sales`: Contains sales figures.\n- `reviews`: Contains critical reviews.\n\n### Step 3: PHP Script\nBelow is a PHP script that queries these tables, processes the data, and generates an HTML table.\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Database connection\n$host = 'localhost';\n$dbName = 'book_data';\n$username = 'root';\n$password = '';\n\ntry {\n    $pdo = new PDO(\"mysql:host=$host;dbname=$dbName\", $username, $password, [\n        PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE => PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION\n    ]);\n} catch (PDOException $e) {\n    die(\"Database connection failed: \" . $e->getMessage());\n}\n\n// Get current year\n$currentYear = date('Y');\n\n// Fetch books data\n$query = \"\n    SELECT \n        b.title, \n        b.author, \n        b.genre,\n        AVG(r.rating) AS average_rating,\n        SUM(s.sales) AS total_sales,\n        AVG(re.review_score) AS average_review_score\n    FROM \n        books b\n    LEFT JOIN \n        ratings r ON b.id = r.book_id\n    LEFT JOIN \n        sales s ON b.id = s.book_id\n    LEFT JOIN \n        reviews re ON b.id = re.book_id\n    WHERE \n        YEAR(b.published_date) = :currentYear\n    GROUP BY \n        b.id\n    ORDER BY \n        total_sales DESC, average_rating DESC, average_review_score DESC\n    LIMIT 10\"; // Limit to top 10 books\n\n$stmt = $pdo->prepare($query);\n$stmt->execute(['currentYear' => $currentYear]);\n\n$books = $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);\n\n// Generate HTML Table\necho \"<h1>Most Popular Books of $currentYear</h1>\";\necho \"<table border='1'>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Title</th>\n            <th>Author</th>\n            <th>Genre</th>\n            <th>Average Rating</th>\n            <th>Total Sales</th>\n            <th>Average Review Score</th>\n        </tr>\";\n\nforeach ($books as $book) {\n    echo \"<tr>\n            <td>{$book['title']}</td>\n            <td>{$book['author']}</td>\n            <td>{$book['genre']}</td>\n            <td>{$book['average_rating']}</td>\n            <td>{$book['total_sales']}</td>\n            <td>{$book['average_review_score']}</td>\n          </tr>\";\n}\n\necho \"</table>\";\n\n?>\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Database Connection**: Connects to a MySQL database using PDO.\n- **Data Retrieval**: Queries the database to get the average user rating, total sales, and average review score for books published in the current year.\n- **Data Processing**: Aggregates data and orders by sales, rating, and review score to identify the most popular books.\n- **HTML Table**: Displays the data in an HTML table format.\n\n### Note\n- Ensure your database has the appropriate schema and data.\n- Modify database connection parameters as per your setup.\n- You may need to refine the SQL query based on your actual data structure and requirements.\n- Consider implementing error handling and security measures like prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.\n\nThis script provides a starting point. You can expand it by integrating more sophisticated data analytics or visualization techniques as needed."
