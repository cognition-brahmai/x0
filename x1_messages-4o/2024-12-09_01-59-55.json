I have a class where the property \"var\" refers to the internal variable \"_var\". I want to be able to call \"var\" without the overhead of the getter and without having to keep track of \"_var\". However, I don't want to use a different internal variable. For instance, using the following code, calling \"var\" takes 204 ns on my PC while \"_var\" takes 44 ns. How can I reduce this overhead?\n\n```\nclass MyClass(object):\n  def __init__(self):\n    self._var = None\n\n  # the property \"var\". First the getter, then the setter\n  @property\n  def var(self):\n    return self._var\n  @var.setter\n  def var(self, newValue):\n    self._var = newValue\n    #... and a lot of other stuff here\n\n  # Use \"var\" a lot! How to avoid the overhead of the getter and not to call self._var!\n  def useAttribute(self):\n    for i in xrange(100000):\n      self.var == 'something'\n```"

        "content": "In Python, using the `@property` decorator for both getter and setter can introduce some overhead due to additional function calls. If you want to reduce this overhead but still want to use the `@property` decorator for just the setter, you can directly access the internal variable `_var` when you don't need the additional logic of the getter. Here\u2019s how you can modify your class:\n\n1. Use the `@property` decorator only for the setter.\n2. Access the internal variable directly when you need to minimize overhead.\n\nHere's a possible solution:\n\n```python\nclass MyClass(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._var = None\n\n    # Only the setter for the property \"var\"\n    @property\n    def var(self):\n        return self._var\n\n    @var.setter\n    def var(self, newValue):\n        self._var = newValue\n        #... and a lot of other stuff here\n\n    # Use \"_var\" directly to avoid the overhead of the getter\n    def useAttribute(self):\n        for i in range(100000):\n            if self._var == 'something':\n                pass\n```\n\nIn this setup, you're directly accessing `_var` in the `useAttribute` method, which reduces the overhead of the getter. By using this approach, you will still benefit from the setter's additional logic when you need to set the variable, but you avoid the getter's overhead when accessing it."
