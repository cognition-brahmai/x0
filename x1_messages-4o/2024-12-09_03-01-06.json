        "content": "Switching between Python versions on a Mac without using third-party version managers like `pyenv` or `virtualenv` can be accomplished by installing the desired version of Python and configuring your environment to use it. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Install Python 3.6.1**:\n   - Download the Python 3.6.1 installer for macOS from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-361/).\n   - Run the installer and follow the instructions to install Python 3.6.1 on your system. By default, this will be installed in `/usr/local/bin/python3.6`.\n\n2. **Check the Installed Python Versions**:\n   - Open Terminal and check the installed versions of Python by typing:\n     ```bash\n     python --version\n     python3 --version\n     ```\n   - You should see Python 2.7 for `python` and Python 3.6.1 for `python3`.\n\n3. **Use Python 3.6.1 by Default**:\n   - To make Python 3.6.1 your default Python version when you type `python`, you need to update your shell profile. Depending on your shell, this could be `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, or `.bashrc` located in your home directory.\n   - Open the appropriate profile file in a text editor. For example, with `nano`, you can open your `.bash_profile` like this:\n     ```bash\n     nano ~/.bash_profile\n     ```\n   - Add the following line to set an alias for Python 3.6.1:\n     ```bash\n     alias python='/usr/local/bin/python3.6'\n     ```\n   - Save the changes and exit the editor (for `nano`, press `CTRL + X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).\n\n4. **Apply the Changes**:\n   - Refresh the profile by sourcing it:\n     ```bash\n     source ~/.bash_profile\n     ```\n   - Now, when you type `python` in Terminal, it should use Python 3.6.1.\n\n5. **Verify the Change**:\n   - Verify that the alias is working by checking the version:\n     ```bash\n     python --version\n     ```\n   - It should return `Python 3.6.1`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to switch between Python versions on your Mac without using any third-party version managers. If you need to switch back to Python 2.7, you can either remove the alias from your profile or temporarily call Python 2.7 using its full path."
