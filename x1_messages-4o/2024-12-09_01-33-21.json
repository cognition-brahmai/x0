For example, when I use `type(2)`, it gives me the output `<class 'int'>`. According to the book, it says \"the word 'class' is used in the sense of a category; a type is a category of values.\" But, I am confused as to why the `type()` function outputs 'class' instead of 'type'. Also, I'm not sure about the difference between type and class; are string, float point, and integer classes of the type \"value\", or are they the same thing? I am unable to find an answer that is simple enough for me to understand."

        "content": "Welcome to the world of Python! It can be a bit confusing at first, especially when it comes to understanding the relationship between types and classes, but let's break it down.\n\nIn Python, everything is an object, and every object has a type. When you use the `type()` function, Python tells you the type of the object you\u2019re dealing with. In Python, types and classes are closely related concepts.\n\n1. **Classes and Types**: \n   - Python is an object-oriented programming language, and in object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. A class defines a set of attributes and methods that the objects created from the class will have.\n   - When you see `<class 'int'>`, it means that `int` is a class in Python, and it is used to create integer objects. Similarly, `str` is a class that creates string objects, and `float` is a class that creates floating-point number objects.\n\n2. **Why 'class' in `type()` output?**:\n   - The term 'class' in the output of `type()` indicates that the entity you are dealing with is an instance of a class. In Python, types are implemented as classes. So, when you call `type(2)`, Python is telling you that the integer `2` is an instance of the class `int`.\n\n3. **Types as Categories**:\n   - You can think of types as categories of values. The `int` class is a category for integer values, `str` for string values, and `float` for floating-point numbers. These categories (or types) define the operations that can be performed on instances of the class and the attributes these instances will have.\n\n4. **No Separate 'Type' Concept**:\n   - In Python, there's no separate concept of 'type' that is distinct from 'class'. The type of an object is essentially the class from which the object is instantiated. Therefore, strings, floats, and integers are both classes and types.\n\nIn summary, in Python, the terms 'type' and 'class' are often used interchangeably because Python uses classes to define the types. When you see `type(2)` resulting in `<class 'int'>`, it\u2019s just Python\u2019s way of saying \"the type of this object is `int`, which is implemented as a class.\""
