I am working with the following code:\n\n```\nclass APPLICANT_DATA(models.Model):\n    SCHEDULED_AT = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)\n\ndef somefunction():\n    app_data = APPLICANT_DATA.objects.all()\n    for item in app_data:\n        the_date = str(item.SCHEDULED_AT.strftime(\"%B-%d-%Y\")) + \", \" + the_date\n```\n\nHowever, I am encountering the error `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'strftime'`, even though my model contains three records that all have date and time. Can anyone provide advice on what I might be doing wrong?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that at least one of the `SCHEDULED_AT` fields you're trying to access is `None`, meaning it doesn't contain a datetime value. Even though you mentioned that all your records have date and time, it's possible that there are some records with `SCHEDULED_AT` set to `None`, or your query might be returning additional records that you didn't expect.\n\nHere's how you can adjust your code to avoid this issue:\n\n```python\nclass APPLICANT_DATA(models.Model):\n    SCHEDULED_AT = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)\n\ndef somefunction():\n    app_data = APPLICANT_DATA.objects.all()\n    for item in app_data:\n        if item.SCHEDULED_AT is not None:  # Check if SCHEDULED_AT is not None\n            the_date = str(item.SCHEDULED_AT.strftime(\"%B-%d-%Y\")) + \", \" + the_date\n```\n\nAdditionally, ensure that `the_date` is initialized before you use it. If you want to accumulate dates into a single string, you should initialize `the_date` before the loop:\n\n```python\ndef somefunction():\n    app_data = APPLICANT_DATA.objects.all()\n    the_date = \"\"  # Initialize the_date before the loop\n    for item in app_data:\n        if item.SCHEDULED_AT is not None:  # Check if SCHEDULED_AT is not None\n            the_date = str(item.SCHEDULED_AT.strftime(\"%B-%d-%Y\")) + \", \" + the_date\n    # Optionally, remove the trailing comma and space\n    the_date = the_date.rstrip(\", \")\n```\n\nThis should help you handle cases where `SCHEDULED_AT` might be `None` and ensure that `the_date` is properly initialized and used."
