However, the individual has a previous arrangement with one of the friends, and they want to show favoritism towards that friend. In light of this, they aim to distribute the money in a way that the chosen friend receives twice as much as the combined share of the other three friends. Can you provide a mathematical expression to illustrate this situation?"

        "content": "Certainly! Let's denote the amount received by the chosen friend as \\( x \\). According to the problem, the chosen friend receives twice as much as the combined share of the other three friends. Therefore, the combined share of the other three friends is \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\).\n\nThe total amount distributed is $100,000, so we can express this situation with the following equation:\n\n\\[ x + \\frac{x}{2} = 100,000 \\]\n\nThis equation represents the distribution, where \\( x \\) is the amount received by the chosen friend. We can solve this equation to find the value of \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x + \\frac{x}{2} = 100,000 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{2x + x}{2} = 100,000 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{3x}{2} = 100,000 \\]\n\\[ 3x = 200,000 \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{200,000}{3} \\]\n\\[ x = 66,666.67 \\]\n\nSo, the chosen friend receives approximately $66,666.67, and the combined share of the other three friends is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{x}{2} = \\frac{66,666.67}{2} = 33,333.33 \\]\n\nThis means the other three friends together receive approximately $33,333.33."
