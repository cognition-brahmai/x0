Are there some alternative hash functions available that use every letter in the alphabet as well as integers, but result in shorter string length and have low collision rates?"

        "content": "When considering non-integer primary keys, particularly those generated via hash functions, you need to balance between key length, the character set used, and collision rates. MD5 produces a 32-character hexadecimal string, which is indeed long for certain applications. Here are some alternatives that may suit your needs:\n\n1. **SHA-1 or SHA-256 with Base64 Encoding**: While SHA-1 and SHA-256 are cryptographic hash functions that produce longer results in hexadecimal form, encoding the output using Base64 can reduce the length. Base64 uses a set of 64 characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, and /), which can be more compact than hexadecimal.\n\n2. **MurmurHash**: This is a non-cryptographic hash function that is known for its speed and low collision rates. While it produces a 128-bit hash, you can truncate it to a shorter length as per your requirements, though this may increase collision chances.\n\n3. **FNV (Fowler\u2013Noll\u2013Vo) Hash Function**: This is another non-cryptographic hash function that is simple and fast, producing smaller hash values. It can be a good choice if you are looking for simplicity and speed over cryptographic security.\n\n4. **UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) with Base32 Encoding**: A UUID is 128 bits long and normally expressed in 36-character format (including hyphens). However, you can encode it using Base32, which uses a 32-character set and can reduce the length.\n\n5. **Custom Hashing with Truncation**: You could create a custom hash function by combining a known hash function and then truncating or altering it to fit your length requirements. Keep in mind that this can increase collision risk, so it\u2019s important to ensure your dataset doesn\u2019t approach the size where collisions become probable.\n\nWhen shortening hashes, remember that the risk of collisions increases as the hash length decreases. Always assess the probability of collisions in the context of your specific application and dataset size."
