The majority of shells, malware, and injections I find are usually files that seem \"out of place\". For instance, I often come across files that contain `eval(base64_decode(.......))`, where \".....\" is a long string of base64 encoded text. These suspicious files usually stand out when I grep through files for key strings. I believe I can build a profiler in Python to statistically identify these \"out of place\" files and flag them for manual review. I'm considering comparing the length of lines in PHP files that contain certain key strings (like `eval`, `base64_decode`, `exec`, `gunzip`, `gzinflate`, `fwrite`, `preg_replace`, etc.) and flagging the lines that deviate from the average length by 2 standard deviations. I'm also considering an approach where I assign weighted rules to certain things, but I'm not sure how to effectively score each attribute. My statistics skills are somewhat rusty, so I would appreciate any guidance on how to proceed with statistical profiling in Python. Could anyone point me in the right direction with guides, tutorials, or libraries?"

        "content": "Building a profiler to detect suspicious PHP files based on statistical patterns is a great approach. Here's a step-by-step guide to getting started with statistical profiling in Python, along with some resources and libraries that might help:\n\n### Step 1: Data Collection\n\n1. **Gather Data**: Collect a dataset of PHP files that are known to be clean and another set known to be suspicious. This will help you in training and testing your model.\n\n2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract features from these files. For your case, you might want to focus on:\n   - Length of lines containing key strings.\n   - Frequency of suspicious functions (e.g., `eval`, `base64_decode`).\n   - File sizes, entropy, and other metadata.\n\n### Step 2: Statistical Analysis\n\n1. **Mean and Standard Deviation**: Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the line lengths containing the key strings for both clean and suspicious files. This will help you identify files that deviate significantly from normal patterns.\n\n2. **Z-Score Calculation**: Use Z-scores to determine how far away a particular line length is from the mean. A line length that falls outside 2 standard deviations could be flagged as suspicious.\n\n### Step 3: Scoring System\n\n1. **Weighted Rules**: Assign weights to different suspicious activities. For example, a line containing both `eval` and `base64_decode` might have a higher weight than one containing just `eval`.\n\n2. **Composite Score**: Calculate a composite score for each file based on the weighted sum of its features. Files exceeding a certain threshold can be flagged for review.\n\n### Step 4: Implementation in Python\n\n1. **Libraries to Use**:\n   - Numpy: For numerical calculations.\n   - Pandas: For data manipulation.\n   - Scikit-learn: For machine learning models (optional, if you decide to classify files based on features).\n   - Matplotlib or Seaborn: For data visualization.\n\n2. **Sample Code**:\n   ```python\n   import numpy as np\n   import pandas as pd\n\n   # Sample data\n   line_lengths = [120, 130, 150, 180, 200, 220]  # Example line lengths\n\n   # Calculate mean and standard deviation\n   mean_length = np.mean(line_lengths)\n   std_dev_length = np.std(line_lengths)\n\n   # Calculate Z-scores\n   z_scores = [(x - mean_length) / std_dev_length for x in line_lengths]\n\n   # Flag lines outside 2 standard deviations\n   suspicious_lines = [i for i, z in enumerate(z_scores) if abs(z) > 2]\n\n   print(\"Suspicious Lines:\", suspicious_lines)\n   ```\n\n### Step 5: Further Considerations\n\n- **Machine Learning**: You might consider building a simple classifier using scikit-learn if you have a labeled dataset of clean and hacked files.\n- **Continuous Improvement**: Continuously update your model with new data as new types of attacks emerge.\n- **Manual Review**: Always have a manual review process as a backup, since statistical methods might produce false positives.\n\n### Resources\n\n- **Python Data Science Handbook** by Jake VanderPlas: Great resource for statistical analysis in Python.\n- **Scikit-learn Documentation**: [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for tutorials on building classifiers.\n- **Kaggle**: Explore datasets and kernels related to malware detection for inspiration.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to build a robust profiling system that helps you detect suspicious PHP files."
