        "content": "The error message you're encountering, `UnboundLocalError: local variable 'batch_index' referenced before assignment`, is unusual given your code snippet. This error typically occurs when a variable is used before it is assigned a value within the same scope. However, since you mentioned that there is no variable named `batch_index` in your code, let's explore some potential causes and solutions:\n\n1. **Keras and TensorFlow Version Discrepancy**: You mentioned that your Keras version is 2.2.4-tf/2.2.5 and TensorFlow version is 1.14.0. These versions should generally be compatible, but sometimes specific combinations of TensorFlow and Keras can lead to unexpected errors. Consider updating TensorFlow to a more recent version if possible.\n\n2. **Deprecation and Argument Names**: In older versions of Keras, `nb_epoch` was the parameter used for specifying the number of epochs. In your code, you use `nb_epoch=200`. This parameter has been deprecated and replaced with `epochs`. The error could be arising due to this deprecated parameter. Update your code to use `epochs=200` instead of `nb_epoch=200`.\n\n3. **Potential Issues with Environment**: If you are running this code in a Jupyter notebook or a specific IDE, there could be some issues with the environment that are not directly related to your code. Try running the code in a different environment or an isolated script to see if the error persists.\n\n4. **Check for Any Unintended Local Variable**: Although you mentioned there is no variable named `batch_index`, it's worth double-checking your entire script or any imported modules for any unintended declarations or modifications that might be affecting the behavior.\n\n5. **Update and Reinstall**: As a last resort, consider updating and reinstalling Keras and TensorFlow to the latest versions. You can do this using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade tensorflow\n   pip install --upgrade keras\n   ```\n\nHere's a revised version of your code with the updated parameter:\n\n```python\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense\n\n# Assuming trainX and trainY are defined\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(Dense(8, input_dim=1, activation='relu'))\nmodel.add(Dense(1))\nmodel.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam')\nmodel.fit(trainX, trainY, epochs=200, batch_size=2, verbose=2)\n```\n\nTry running this updated code and see if the error persists. If you still encounter issues, consider providing more context or reviewing any additional code surrounding this snippet."
