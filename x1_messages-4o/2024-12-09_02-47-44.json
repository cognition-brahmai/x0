Some time ago, I was using the `tf.contrib.learn.DNNRegressor` API which I found very convenient. Now, for a new project, I want to again use a Regressor but with more control over the actual model, which I believe is provided by the `Estimator` API via the `model_fn` parameter. However, I noticed that there are two `Estimator`s in the TensorFlow API: `tf.contrib.learn.Estimator` and `tf.estimator.Estimator`. They both seem to offer similar APIs, yet their usage is slightly different. Could you explain why these two different implementations exist and if there are circumstances under which one should be preferred over the other? I have tried looking through the TensorFlow documentation and tutorials but I couldn't find any clear differences or guidance on when to use which of the two."

        "content": "Certainly! The existence of both `tf.estimator.Estimator` and `tf.contrib.learn.Estimator` is rooted in the evolution of TensorFlow's API over time. Here's a breakdown of the differences and guidance on which one to use:\n\n### Evolution of APIs:\n\n1. **`tf.contrib.learn.Estimator`:**\n   - This was part of the earlier high-level APIs intended to simplify the process of building models. It resides in the `contrib` module, which is essentially a space for experimental or less stable features.\n   - Being part of `contrib`, anything in this module was subject to change and not guaranteed to be backward compatible in future releases.\n   - `tf.contrib.learn` was more of an experimental playground in the early days of TensorFlow, providing high-level abstractions for quick model development.\n\n2. **`tf.estimator.Estimator`:**\n   - This is the more stable and preferred version of the Estimator API. It migrated from `tf.contrib.learn` to `tf.estimator` as it became more stable and robust.\n   - `tf.estimator` is part of the core TensorFlow API, indicating that it is more mature and intended for long-term use.\n   - It provides greater flexibility and control, especially with the `model_fn` parameter, which allows you to define custom models with more complex logic.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Use `tf.estimator.Estimator`:** Given that `tf.contrib.learn` is deprecated and was removed in TensorFlow 2.x, it's best to use `tf.estimator`. This API is more robust, has better support, and is the recommended approach for building models with TensorFlow's Estimator framework.\n\n- **Control and Flexibility:** If you need more control over your model architecture and training process, `tf.estimator.Estimator` is the right choice because it allows custom `model_fn` implementations.\n\n- **Future Compatibility:** By using `tf.estimator`, you ensure that your code will be more compatible with future versions of TensorFlow, as `contrib` features are not guaranteed to be maintained.\n\n### Transition to TensorFlow 2.x:\n\n- With TensorFlow 2.x, the high-level Keras API is encouraged for most use-cases due to its simplicity and integration. The Estimator API is still available, especially for production environments and distributed training, but Keras is generally recommended for new projects.\n\nIn summary, if you're starting a new project or updating an older one, the best practice is to use `tf.estimator.Estimator` or consider the Keras API if it suits your needs, especially in TensorFlow 2.x."
