        "content": "To read very large text files without loading the entire content into memory, you can use Python's built-in file handling capabilities. Specifically, you can read the file line by line using a loop. This method is efficient because it only loads one line into memory at a time. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef read_large_file(file_path):\n    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n        for line in file:\n            # Process the line here\n            print(line.strip())  # Example: print the line without trailing newline character\n\n# Example usage\nfile_path = 'path_to_your_large_file.txt'\nread_large_file(file_path)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`open(file_path, 'r')`**: Opens the file in read mode.\n- **`with` statement**: Ensures that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised.\n- **`for line in file:`**: Iterates over each line in the file, loading one line at a time into memory.\n- **`line.strip()`**: Removes any leading or trailing whitespace, including the newline character at the end of each line.\n\nThis approach is memory efficient and well-suited for handling very large files. You can also adapt this method to perform any processing you need on each line instead of just printing it."
