Here are my two lists:\n\n```python\na = ['Orange and Banana', 'Orange Banana']\nb = ['Grapes', 'Orange Banana']\n```\nI'd like to generate a new list, `c`, that contains all unique elements from both `a` and `b`, preserving the original order.

        "content": "To achieve the union of two lists while preserving the order and ensuring all elements are unique, you can use list comprehension along with a set to track seen elements. Here's a way to do it:\n\n```python\na = ['Orange and Banana', 'Orange Banana']\nb = ['Grapes', 'Orange Banana']\n\n# Using list comprehension and a set to preserve order and uniqueness\nc = [x for lst in (a, b) for x in lst if x not in locals().setdefault('seen', set()) and not locals()['seen'].add(x)]\n\nprint(c)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The list comprehension iterates through both lists `a` and `b`.\n- `locals().setdefault('seen', set())` initializes a set named `seen` in the local scope to keep track of elements that have already been added to the result list `c`.\n- `if x not in locals().setdefault('seen', set()) and not locals()['seen'].add(x)` checks if an element `x` has not been seen. If not, it adds `x` to `seen`.\n- `not locals()['seen'].add(x)` effectively adds `x` to the `seen` set. The `add()` method returns `None`, which is why the `not` operator is used to make the condition evaluate as `True` so that `x` gets included in the new list `c`.\n\nThis approach ensures that `c` contains all unique elements from `a` and `b`, while preserving the order from the original lists."
