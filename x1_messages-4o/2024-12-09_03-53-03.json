I have a dataset with 84 monthly sales from January 2013 to December 2019, with each sale corresponding to a specific month. I want to use the first five years (60 months) to train the model and leave the last two years (24 months) as test data to evaluate the model's predictions. However, I understand that the cross validation function does not support months, so I converted the time periods to days, even though my original dataset only has monthly data. I used the following code: `cv_results = cross_validation( model = prophet, initial='1825 days', period='30 days', horizon = '60 days')`. I'm not sure this is the right approach. Could you please clarify the concept of cutoff dates and forecast periods in this context?"

        "content": "Certainly! When using Facebook's Prophet for time series forecasting, the `cross_validation` function is a helpful tool to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. It's important to understand how cutoff dates and forecast periods work in this context.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n\n1. **Initial Period**: This is the amount of data used initially to train the model before starting cross-validation. In your case, you've specified `initial='1825 days'`, which corresponds to roughly 60 months (5 years). This means the model will be trained on these 5 years of data before starting the validation process.\n\n2. **Horizon**: This is the period into the future for which forecasts are made during each cross-validation step. You specified `horizon = '60 days'`, which means the model will forecast two months ahead from each cutoff point.\n\n3. **Period**: This parameter defines the spacing between cutoff dates. It determines how often the model is retrained and evaluated. You used `period='30 days'`, indicating that the model is evaluated every month.\n\n### Cutoff Dates:\n\n- The cutoff dates are specific points in time where the model stops training and starts forecasting into the future for the specified horizon.\n- Given your setup with `initial='1825 days'`, the first cutoff will be at the end of this period.\n- With `period='30 days'`, new cutoffs will be spaced 30 days apart. The model makes forecasts for each of these cutoffs for the next 60 days.\n\n### Forecasting Periods:\n\n- At each cutoff date, the model is trained up to that point (excluding the horizon) and is then used to forecast the next 60 days.\n- The forecasts are then compared against the actual data to compute error metrics, which help evaluate the model's performance.\n\n### Considerations:\n\n- Since your dataset is monthly, ensure that the conversion to daily frequency doesn't introduce errors or misalignments. Prophet will handle daily data, but your interpretation should align with monthly predictions.\n- The choice of horizon and period should reflect the nature of your data and the forecasting goals. For monthly data, consider if a horizon of 60 days (two months) aligns with your evaluation objectives.\n- You might also consider adjusting the horizon to reflect the monthly nature, such as `horizon='90 days'` for a quarterly forecast, if appropriate.\n\nAdjust your cross-validation settings based on these explanations to best suit your forecasting needs. If necessary, you can experiment with different parameter settings to find the most suitable configuration for your dataset."
