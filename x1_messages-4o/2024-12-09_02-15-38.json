        "content": "I am trying to run TensorFlow with GPU support, but it's only using the CPU and not the GPU. I am assuming that this is because it expects CUDA 10.0 but it finds 10.2. I have installed CUDA 10.2 but have purged it and installed 10.0. My system setup is: Ubuntu 19.10, AMD Ryzen 2700 CPU, RTX 2080 S and the 440 Nvidia driver. When I check with nvidia-smi and nvcc -version, it says CUDA version is 10.2. But when I check the version.txt, I get 10.0.130. I am trying to check the devices with:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.python.client import device_lib\nprint(device_lib.list_local_devices())\n```\n\nBut it's not running on the GPU, and is super slow on the 8-core CPU. Is this because I am not able to register the 10.0.130 version? Any advice on how to solve this?"

        "content": "Running TensorFlow with GPU support can indeed be tricky due to the specific dependencies on CUDA and cuDNN versions. Here are some steps you can take to diagnose and fix the issue:\n\n1. **Verify CUDA and cuDNN Installation:**\n   - Ensure that CUDA 10.0 and the corresponding cuDNN version are installed correctly. Sometimes remnants of older versions can cause conflicts.\n   - You can verify the CUDA version by running `nvcc --version` and check cuDNN by inspecting the contents of the cuDNN include directory (usually `/usr/local/cuda/include/cudnn.h`).\n\n2. **Environment Variables:**\n   - Set the `CUDA_HOME` environment variable to point to your CUDA 10.0 installation:\n     ```bash\n     export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-10.0\n     export PATH=$CUDA_HOME/bin:$PATH\n     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CUDA_HOME/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n     ```\n   - Ensure these variables are set in your shell or script running TensorFlow.\n\n3. **TensorFlow and CUDA Compatibility:**\n   - Ensure that the TensorFlow version you are using is compatible with CUDA 10.0. For example, TensorFlow 1.13.1 or 1.14.0 supports CUDA 10.0.\n   - You can check TensorFlow's GitHub or documentation for the specific versions that are compatible.\n\n4. **Check GPU Availability:**\n   - Run the following Python script to check if TensorFlow can detect your GPU:\n     ```python\n     import tensorflow as tf\n     print(\"Num GPUs Available: \", len(tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')))\n     ```\n   - If it returns 0, TensorFlow is not recognizing your GPU.\n\n5. **Verify TensorFlow Installation:**\n   - Sometimes TensorFlow might be installed without GPU support. Make sure you have installed the GPU version:\n     ```bash\n     pip install tensorflow-gpu==<version>\n     ```\n\n6. **NVIDIA Driver:**\n   - Ensure that your NVIDIA driver is up-to-date and compatible with your GPU and CUDA version. You have mentioned using driver 440, which should be appropriate for your RTX 2080 S.\n\n7. **Check for Conflicting Libraries:**\n   - Ensure that there are no conflicting libraries in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Sometimes older versions of libraries can cause issues.\n\n8. **Reboot and Test:**\n   - After making these changes, reboot your system to ensure that all configurations are applied. Then test again to see if TensorFlow can utilize the GPU.\n\n9. **Logs and Errors:**\n   - Check TensorFlow logs for any errors or warnings that might indicate what's going wrong.\n\nIf you've gone through these steps and are still facing issues, it might be worth trying a different combination of TensorFlow, CUDA, and cuDNN versions or even testing on a clean environment using Docker containers that have pre-configured TensorFlow GPU support."
