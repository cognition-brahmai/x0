        "content": "Is there an efficient way in numpy to create a symmetric matrix which automatically fills the position at [j][i] when [i][j] is written to? For instance, if I create a symmetric matrix 'a' and assign a value to a[0][1], it should also assign the same value to a[1][0]. I would like to verify this by checking if a[1][0] equals a[0][1] and by asserting if numpy.all(a == a.T). An automatic Hermitian would also be beneficial, although it is not a requirement at the moment.\n\n```python\nimport numpy\na = numpy.symmetric((3, 3))\na[0][1] = 1\na[1][0] == a[0][1]\n# True\nprint(a)\n# [[0 1 0], [1 0 0], [0 0 0]]\n\nassert numpy.all(a == a.T) # for any symmetric matrix\n```"

        "content": "NumPy itself does not provide a built-in symmetric matrix type that automatically maintains symmetry when you update elements. However, you can achieve this behavior by creating a custom symmetric matrix class. Here's a simple implementation of such a class:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nclass SymmetricMatrix:\n    def __init__(self, shape):\n        if shape[0] != shape[1]:\n            raise ValueError(\"Matrix must be square\")\n        self.shape = shape\n        self._matrix = np.zeros(shape)\n\n    def __getitem__(self, index):\n        i, j = index\n        return self._matrix[i, j]\n\n    def __setitem__(self, index, value):\n        i, j = index\n        self._matrix[i, j] = value\n        self._matrix[j, i] = value\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return repr(self._matrix)\n\n    def as_array(self):\n        return self._matrix\n\n# Usage\na = SymmetricMatrix((3, 3))\na[0, 1] = 1\nprint(a[1, 0] == a[0, 1])  # True\nprint(a)\n# Output:\n# [[0. 1. 0.]\n#  [1. 0. 0.]\n#  [0. 0. 0.]]\n\nassert np.all(a.as_array() == a.as_array().T)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`SymmetricMatrix` Class:** This class represents a symmetric matrix and maintains the symmetry automatically when elements are updated.\n- **`__getitem__` and `__setitem__`:** These methods allow you to access and modify matrix elements using the bracket notation `a[i, j]`.\n- **Automatic Symmetry:** When you set an element at position `(i, j)`, it automatically sets the element at position `(j, i)` to maintain symmetry.\n- **`as_array` Method:** This method returns the underlying NumPy array representation of the symmetric matrix, which can be used for compatibility with NumPy functions.\n\nThis approach allows you to work with matrices as if they were symmetric by design, making it easier to maintain and work with symmetric matrices in your computations."
