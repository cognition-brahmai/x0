I understand the basic approach to creating and writing to a file as shown in the code below:\n\n```python\nhtml_file = open(\"filename\",\"w\")\nhtml_file.write()\nhtml_file.close()\n```\nHowever, I am not sure how to apply this approach when I want to write longer and more complex HTML codes, such as:\n\n```html\n<table border=1>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Number</th>\n    <th>Square</th>\n  </tr>\n  <indent>\n  <% for i in range(10): %>\n    <tr>\n    <td><%= i %></td>\n    <td><%= i**2 %></td>\n    </tr>\n  </indent>\n</table>\n```\nHow can I go about this?"

        "content": "To create and save an HTML file with more complex content using Python, you can use a multi-line string to write the HTML code. This approach allows you to maintain the structure and readability of your HTML code. Here's how you can do it:\n\nFirst, let's address your HTML code. You seem to have included some templating syntax (`<% %>` and `<%= %>`), which is not standard HTML. If you're looking to generate dynamic HTML content, you might be using a templating engine like Jinja2 in Python. But for the sake of this example, I'll show you a basic way to embed dynamic content within an HTML file using Python without a templating engine.\n\nHere's a simple example to write the HTML content you provided, iterating over a range of numbers and calculating their squares:\n\n```python\n# Define the HTML content with placeholders for dynamic content\nhtml_content = \"\"\"<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Number</th>\n    <th>Square</th>\n  </tr>\n\"\"\"\n\n# Use a loop to add rows dynamically\nfor i in range(10):\n    row = f\"\"\"  <tr>\n    <td>{i}</td>\n    <td>{i**2}</td>\n  </tr>\n\"\"\"\n    html_content += row\n\nhtml_content += \"</table>\"\n\n# Write to the HTML file\nwith open(\"filename.html\", \"w\") as html_file:\n    html_file.write(html_content)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Multi-line String**: The HTML content is initially defined as a multi-line string using triple quotes (`\"\"\"`), which allows you to keep the structure of your HTML intact.\n\n2. **Dynamic Content**: A loop is used to generate the rows of the table dynamically. This is done by using Python's f-strings to insert values into the HTML code.\n\n3. **File Writing**: The `with` statement is used to open the file. This ensures that the file is properly closed after writing, even if an error occurs. The HTML content is then written to the file.\n\nThis script will create an HTML file named `filename.html` with the desired table structure and dynamically generated content for numbers and their squares. If you need to use templating for more complex scenarios, consider using a library like Jinja2, which is designed to handle such tasks more elegantly."
