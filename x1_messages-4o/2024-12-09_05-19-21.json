I read that the statement `x = y = somefunction()` is equivalent to:\n\n```\ny = somefunction()\nx = y\n```\nNow, I'm wondering, is the statement `x = y = somefunction()` the same as:\n\n```\nx = somefunction()\ny = somefunction()\n```\nBased on my current understanding, both these statements should be equivalent because a function can only return a single value. Is my understanding correct?"

        "content": "Your current understanding is not correct. When you use the chained assignment statement `x = y = somefunction()`, the function `somefunction()` is only called once, and the same result is assigned to both `x` and `y`. This is equivalent to:\n\n```python\ny = somefunction()  # somefunction() is called once\nx = y               # x is assigned the result of y\n```\n\nHowever, the statement:\n\n```python\nx = somefunction()\ny = somefunction()\n```\n\ncalls `somefunction()` twice, meaning the function is executed separately for each assignment. As a result, `x` and `y` could potentially end up with different values if `somefunction()` returns different results on each call, such as when it involves random elements, time-dependent operations, or mutable state.\n\nIn summary, `x = y = somefunction()` and `x = somefunction(); y = somefunction()` are not equivalent. The former calls the function once, while the latter calls it twice."
