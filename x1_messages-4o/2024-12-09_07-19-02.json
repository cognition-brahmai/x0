The snippet I have is:\n\n    import datetime\n    j = iter(datetime.datetime.now, None)\n    next(j)\n\nInstead of giving me the expected output of the current time, as `now()` should, every time I call `next()`, it is returning a `StopIteration` error. The error trace is as follows:\n\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n    StopIteration\n\nI have seen similar code working in Python 3.3. Has something changed in version 3.6.1 that is causing this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with the `iter()` function in conjunction with `datetime.datetime.now` is related to how the `iter()` function is being used. The `iter()` function can take two arguments: a callable and a sentinel value. When you use this two-argument form, `iter(callable, sentinel)`, it repeatedly calls the `callable` until the callable's return value is equal to the sentinel value, and then it raises `StopIteration`.\n\nIn your snippet:\n```python\nimport datetime\nj = iter(datetime.datetime.now, None)\nnext(j)\n```\n\nThe `iter()` function is being used incorrectly for the desired behavior. Specifically, `datetime.datetime.now` is being called repeatedly until it returns `None`, which will never happen because `datetime.datetime.now()` always returns a `datetime` object, not `None`. Therefore, `iter()` immediately raises `StopIteration`.\n\nTo get the current time repeatedly, you should use a different approach, such as defining a generator function:\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef current_time_generator():\n    while True:\n        yield datetime.datetime.now()\n\nj = current_time_generator()\nprint(next(j))\nprint(next(j))  # This will give you the current time each time you call next()\n```\n\nThis generator will provide you with the current time whenever you call `next()`. The generator function `current_time_generator()` yields the current datetime indefinitely, which matches the behavior you are looking for."
