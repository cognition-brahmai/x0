        "content": "The `TypeError` you're encountering, \"super(type, obj): obj must be an instance or subtype of type,\" typically occurs when there's an issue with using the `super()` function incorrectly in your class inheritance structure. The `super()` function is used to call methods from a parent class, and this error usually arises when `super()` is not provided with the right arguments or used in an inappropriate context.\n\nHere are some common reasons and solutions for this error:\n\n1. **Incorrect Class Hierarchy:**\n   Make sure that the class from which you are trying to call `super()` actually inherits from another class. If the class does not have a valid parent class, you will encounter this error.\n\n2. **Incorrect `super()` Usage:**\n   In Python 3, `super()` can be called without arguments inside a class method. Ensure that you are not passing any arguments to `super()` unless absolutely necessary. The correct usage is:\n   ```python\n   class ChildClass(ParentClass):\n       def __init__(self, args):\n           super().__init__(args)\n   ```\n\n3. **Passing Incorrect Arguments to `super()`:**\n   If you are using Python 2 or explicitly passing arguments to `super()`, make sure that you pass the class name and `self`:\n   ```python\n   class ChildClass(ParentClass):\n       def __init__(self, args):\n           super(ChildClass, self).__init__(args)\n   ```\n\n4. **Ensure Proper Subclassing:**\n   Ensure that the class in which you're calling `super()` is a subclass of the class you're trying to access. This means verifying that the class hierarchy is properly defined and that the child class directly or indirectly inherits from the parent class.\n\n5. **Check for Multiple Inheritance:**\n   If you are using multiple inheritance, make sure that the MRO (Method Resolution Order) is valid and that all classes in the hierarchy are being initialized correctly.\n\nHere's a simple example to illustrate the correct usage of `super()`:\n\n```python\nclass Parent:\n    def __init__(self):\n        print(\"Parent initialized\")\n\nclass Child(Parent):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()  # Correct usage of super()\n        print(\"Child initialized\")\n\n# Instantiate Child class\nchild_instance = Child()\n```\n\nIf you continue to face issues, reviewing the class hierarchy and the way `super()` is used in your code should help you identify and correct the problem."
