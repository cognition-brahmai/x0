The chords must be displayed in the specific notation of [C], [Am], [F], [G], [D], [Em], [A], [E], and [B]. Additionally, the program should be designed to require multiple-step reasoning processes in order to achieve the desired output. Can you provide a LaTeX code to showcase the generated output of the program?"

        "content": "Creating a Python program that automatically generates guitar chords, lyrics, and strumming patterns for a song like \"The Path of Life\" involves multiple steps, including text generation, chord progression selection, and formatting. Here's a basic outline of how you can achieve this, along with an example of how you might present the generated output using LaTeX.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Generate Lyrics:**\n   - Use a text generation model like GPT-3 or a Markov chain to generate the lyrics. For simplicity, I'll use placeholder text.\n\n2. **Select Chord Progressions:**\n   - Use predefined chord progressions or randomly select from common patterns like C-G-Am-F or G-D-Em-C.\n\n3. **Assign Chords to Lyrics:**\n   - Map chords to specific lines or phrases within your lyrics.\n\n4. **Define Strumming Pattern:**\n   - Use common patterns like D-DU-UDU (D = Downstroke, U = Upstroke).\n\n5. **Format in LaTeX:**\n   - Use LaTeX to format the song with chords, lyrics, and structure.\n\n### Python Code Example\n\nHere's a simple Python script that demonstrates steps 2 and 3. It uses predefined lyrics and assigns chord progressions:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# Sample lyrics and structure\nverses = [\n    \"Walking down the road of life, [C] searching for the [G] light,\",\n    \"Through the [Am] shadows and the [F] echoes of the [C] night.\",\n]\n\nchorus = [\n    \"This is the [G] path of life, [D] where dreams [Em] come alive,\",\n    \"With every [C] step, we [G] strive, on the [D] path of [Em] life.\",\n]\n\n# Chord progressions\nchord_progressions = [\n    [\"C\", \"G\", \"Am\", \"F\"],\n    [\"G\", \"D\", \"Em\", \"C\"],\n]\n\n# Randomly select a chord progression\nselected_progression = random.choice(chord_progressions)\n\n# Assign chords to lyrics\ndef assign_chords(lyrics, progression):\n    return [line.replace(\"[C]\", f\"[{progression[0]}]\").replace(\"[G]\", f\"[{progression[1]}]\")\n            .replace(\"[Am]\", f\"[{progression[2]}]\").replace(\"[F]\", f\"[{progression[3]}]\") for line in lyrics]\n\n# Apply chords\nverse_with_chords = assign_chords(verses, selected_progression)\nchorus_with_chords = assign_chords(chorus, selected_progression)\n\n# Display formatted lyrics\nfor line in verse_with_chords + [\"\\n\"] + chorus_with_chords:\n    print(line)\n```\n\n### LaTeX Code Example\n\nHere's how you can present the output in LaTeX:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{guitarchordschemes}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\section*{The Path of Life}\n\n\\textbf{Verse 1} \\\\\nWalking down the road of life, \\ch{C} searching for the \\ch{G} light, \\\\\nThrough the \\ch{Am} shadows and the \\ch{F} echoes of the \\ch{C} night. \\\\\n\n\\textbf{Chorus} \\\\\nThis is the \\ch{G} path of life, \\ch{D} where dreams \\ch{Em} come alive, \\\\\nWith every \\ch{C} step, we \\ch{G} strive, on the \\ch{D} path of \\ch{Em} life. \\\\\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n### Notes\n- This is a simplified example. To fully automate this, you would integrate an AI model for lyric generation.\n- Use packages like `guitarchordschemes` in LaTeX for better chord representation.\n- Ensure you have a LaTeX distribution installed to compile the document.\n\nThis approach gives you a framework for generating a song with chords and lyrics while showcasing the output in a structured format using LaTeX."
