I'm currently able to add summaries and view the results in Tensorboard, but I am looking for an elegant way to get the scalar summary values printed during training. This is currently happening for training loss, for example: `loss = 0.672677, step = 2901 (52.995 sec)`. However, I would like to have something like `loss = 0.672677, accuracy = 0.54678, step = 2901 (52.995 sec)`. Is there a way to achieve this without much trouble? I'm also interested in the training batch accuracy."

        "content": "To print additional training metrics such as batch accuracy when using the TensorFlow Estimator API, you can achieve this by modifying the `train` function within your custom Estimator model function. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Modify the Model Function:**\n   \n   Add the metric calculation to your `model_fn`. You can calculate batch accuracy using TensorFlow operations and include it in the logging hooks.\n\n2. **Use Logging Hooks:**\n\n   Utilize `tf.train.LoggingTensorHook` to log additional metrics during training. This hook allows you to specify tensors that you want to log and provides an easy way to print them in your console.\n\nHere's a basic example of how to implement this:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ndef model_fn(features, labels, mode):\n    # Define your model architecture here\n    logits = your_model_architecture(features)\n\n    # Compute predictions and loss\n    predictions = tf.argmax(logits, axis=1)\n    loss = tf.losses.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy(labels=labels, logits=logits)\n\n    # Calculate batch accuracy\n    accuracy = tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(tf.equal(predictions, labels), tf.float32))\n\n    # Define training operation\n    if mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.TRAIN:\n        optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=0.001)\n        train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss, global_step=tf.train.get_global_step())\n\n        # Logging hook to print additional metrics\n        logging_hook = tf.train.LoggingTensorHook(\n            tensors={'loss': loss, 'accuracy': accuracy},\n            every_n_iter=100\n        )\n\n        return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(\n            mode=mode,\n            loss=loss,\n            train_op=train_op,\n            training_hooks=[logging_hook]\n        )\n\n    # Define evaluation operation\n    elif mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.EVAL:\n        eval_metric_ops = {\n            'accuracy': tf.metrics.accuracy(labels=labels, predictions=predictions)\n        }\n        return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(\n            mode=mode,\n            loss=loss,\n            eval_metric_ops=eval_metric_ops\n        )\n\n# Create the Estimator\nestimator = tf.estimator.Estimator(model_fn=model_fn)\n\n# Train the model\nestimator.train(input_fn=train_input_fn, steps=10000)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **Batch Accuracy Calculation:** In the `model_fn`, we calculate the batch accuracy using `tf.reduce_mean` and `tf.cast` to convert the boolean accuracy results into a float tensor.\n  \n- **Logging Hook:** We use `tf.train.LoggingTensorHook` to log the loss and accuracy every 100 iterations. You can adjust `every_n_iter` to suit your needs.\n\n- **Training Hooks:** The `training_hooks` parameter in `EstimatorSpec` allows you to specify hooks like `LoggingTensorHook`.\n\nBy following this setup, you will see additional metrics such as batch accuracy printed alongside the training loss in your console output. Adjust the logging frequency and the specific tensors logged according to your requirements."
