        "content": "To use NumPy's `logical_or` and `logical_and` functions with more than two arrays, you can utilize Python's `reduce` function from the `functools` module. This approach allows you to apply these logical operations across multiple arrays efficiently.\n\n### Union of More than Two Arrays with `logical_or`\n\nTo find the union of more than two arrays, you can apply `np.logical_or` iteratively over the arrays using `reduce`. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom functools import reduce\n\n# Example arrays\narray1 = np.array([True, False, True, False])\narray2 = np.array([False, True, False, False])\narray3 = np.array([True, True, False, True])\n\n# Use reduce to apply logical_or across all arrays\nunion_result = reduce(np.logical_or, [array1, array2, array3])\n\nprint(\"Union of arrays:\", union_result)\n```\n\n### Intersection of More than Two Arrays with `logical_and`\n\nSimilarly, to find the intersection of more than two arrays, you can apply `np.logical_and` iteratively:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom functools import reduce\n\n# Example arrays\narray1 = np.array([True, False, True, False])\narray2 = np.array([True, True, False, False])\narray3 = np.array([True, False, False, True])\n\n# Use reduce to apply logical_and across all arrays\nintersection_result = reduce(np.logical_and, [array1, array2, array3])\n\nprint(\"Intersection of arrays:\", intersection_result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **`reduce(function, iterable)`**: This function applies the given function cumulatively to the items of the iterable, from left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single value.\n- **`np.logical_or`**: This function computes the element-wise logical OR of the input arrays.\n- **`np.logical_and`**: This function computes the element-wise logical AND of the input arrays.\n\nBy using `reduce`, you can efficiently compute the union or intersection of multiple arrays with these logical operations."
