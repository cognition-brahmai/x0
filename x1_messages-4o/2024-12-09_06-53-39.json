        "content": "In Python, closures capture variables by reference, meaning they \"remember\" the environment in which they were created. However, directly modifying a non-global variable within a closure is not straightforward because of how the scope works. \n\nThat said, you can achieve this by using mutable objects or leveraging the `nonlocal` keyword in Python 3. Here's how you can modify the captured variable `var_a` in a closure:\n\n### Using a Mutable Object:\n\nYou can encapsulate `var_a` in a mutable object like a list or a dictionary:\n\n```python\ndef foo():\n    var_a = [2]  # Use a list to make it mutable\n    var_b = 3\n\n    def _closure(x):\n        return var_a[0] + var_b + x\n\n    def set_var_a(new_value):\n        var_a[0] = new_value\n\n    return _closure, set_var_a\n\n\nlocalClosure, set_var_a = foo()\n\n# Local closure is now \"return 2 + 3 + x\"\na = localClosure(1)  # 2 + 3 + 1 == 6\n\n# Modify var_a using the setter\nset_var_a(0)\n\n# Local closure is now \"return 0 + 3 + x\"\nb = localClosure(1)  # 0 + 3 + 1 == 4\n\nprint(a, b)  # Output: 6 4\n```\n\n### Using `nonlocal` (Python 3.x):\n\nIf you can modify the `foo()` function, you can use the `nonlocal` keyword to modify the variable within a nested function:\n\n```python\ndef foo():\n    var_a = 2\n    var_b = 3\n\n    def _closure(x):\n        return var_a + var_b + x\n\n    def set_var_a(new_value):\n        nonlocal var_a\n        var_a = new_value\n\n    return _closure, set_var_a\n\n\nlocalClosure, set_var_a = foo()\n\n# Local closure is now \"return 2 + 3 + x\"\na = localClosure(1)  # 2 + 3 + 1 == 6\n\n# Modify var_a using the setter\nset_var_a(0)\n\n# Local closure is now \"return 0 + 3 + x\"\nb = localClosure(1)  # 0 + 3 + 1 == 4\n\nprint(a, b)  # Output: 6 4\n```\n\nIn both examples, `set_var_a` is a function that allows you to modify the `var_a` variable captured by the closure."
