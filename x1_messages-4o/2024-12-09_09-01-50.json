Here's a step-by-step guide to help you achieve this:\n\n1. **Install Required Libraries**: You'll need `requests` for handling HTTP requests and `BeautifulSoup` from `bs4` for parsing HTML content. Install these using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests beautifulsoup4\n   ```\n\n2. **Understand Hacker News Login**: Hacker News uses a form-based login system. You'll need to submit a POST request with your username and password to log in.\n\n3. **Fetch Saved Stories**: Once logged in, you can navigate to the saved stories page and scrape the content.\n\nHere is a sample script to help you get started:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n# Define the login URL and the saved stories URL\nlogin_url = \"https://news.ycombinator.com/login\"\nsaved_stories_url = \"https://news.ycombinator.com/saved?id=your_username\"\n\n# Create a session to persist cookies\nsession = requests.Session()\n\n# Define your login credentials\ncredentials = {\n    'acct': 'your_username',\n    'pw': 'your_password'\n}\n\n# Log in to Hacker News\nresponse = session.post(login_url, data=credentials)\n\n# Check if login was successful\nif response.ok:\n    print(\"Logged in successfully!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Login failed!\")\n    exit()\n\n# Fetch the saved stories page\nresponse = session.get(saved_stories_url)\n\n# Check if the request was successful\nif response.ok:\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\n    # Find the saved stories\n    saved_stories = soup.find_all('a', class_='titlelink')\n    \n    # Print the titles and URLs of the saved stories\n    for story in saved_stories:\n        print(story.get_text(), \"-\", story['href'])\nelse:\n    print(\"Failed to fetch saved stories!\")\n\n```\n\n### Important Notes:\n\n- Replace `'your_username'` and `'your_password'` with your actual Hacker News username and password.\n- This script assumes that the login will succeed and cookies will be handled by the session.\n- The `saved_stories_url` needs to be customized with your Hacker News username.\n- Be cautious about storing credentials in your scripts. Consider using environment variables or a secure vault for real applications.\n- Web scraping should be done in compliance with the website's terms of service. Be respectful of their server load and avoid making too many requests in a short period.\n\nThis script should give you a basic framework to work with. You might need to adjust the parsing logic if Hacker News updates its HTML structure."
