If the version you want is listed, you can select it directly.\n\n3. **Add a New Python Interpreter:**\n   - If the desired Python version isn\u2019t listed, click on the `Cog` icon (usually found near the interpreter list) and select `Add...`.\n   - In the new window, choose `Existing environment` if you have Python installed on your machine and you just need to point PyCharm to it.\n   - Click the `...` button next to the interpreter path and navigate to the directory where the desired Python version is installed. Typically, this will be in a directory like `/usr/bin` or `C:\\PythonXX\\` where `XX` is the version number.\n   - Select the `python.exe` (on Windows) or the `python` binary (on macOS/Linux).\n\n4. **Apply the Changes:**\n   - Once you\u2019ve selected or added the desired interpreter, click `OK` to close the Add Python Interpreter window.\n   - Click `Apply` and then `OK` in the main Settings/Preferences window to save your changes.\n\nNow, your project should be using the new Python interpreter version you selected. You can verify this by checking the Python version in your Python console within PyCharm or by running a simple script that prints the Python version."
