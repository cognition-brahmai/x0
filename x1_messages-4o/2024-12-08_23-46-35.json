However, Bayes' theorem typically involves finding \\( P(A|E) \\) or similar, and not directly \\( P(E|A \\cap B) \\). Assuming independence for simplicity, the intersection \\( A \\cap B \\) would have its own conditional probability.\n\nFor independent events, we can multiply the individual probabilities. However, without specific information on the joint distribution or independence, calculating \\( P(E|A \\cap B) \\) directly might not be feasible.\n\nIf you have additional context or assumptions (such as independence or joint distributions), we can proceed accordingly. Otherwise, the calculation of \\( P(E) \\) already gives the overall likelihood of \\( E \\) occurring based on the provided conditional probabilities."
