When I use `data.Country` and `data.Year`, it successfully displays the first and second column respectively. However, when I try to access the 'Number' column using `data.Number`, I encounter an error message: `AttributeError: 'DataFrame' object has no attribute 'Number'.` Why is this happening and how can I solve this?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering typically occurs when the column name you're trying to access doesn't exactly match any of the column names in your DataFrame. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check the Column Names:**\n   Ensure that the column name in your CSV file is exactly \"Number\". Sometimes, column names might have leading or trailing spaces, or might be capitalized differently.\n\n   ```python\n   print(data.columns)\n   ```\n\n   This will display all column names in the DataFrame so you can verify if \"Number\" is listed as expected.\n\n2. **Access Column Using Brackets:**\n   If you confirm that the column name is indeed \"Number\" but still encounter an issue, try accessing it using brackets:\n\n   ```python\n   data['Number']\n   ```\n\n   Using brackets is generally more robust for accessing columns, especially if column names have spaces or special characters.\n\n3. **Check for Leading/Trailing Spaces:**\n   If there are leading or trailing spaces in the column name, you can strip them using:\n\n   ```python\n   data.columns = data.columns.str.strip()\n   ```\n\n   After stripping, try accessing the column again.\n\n4. **Inspect for Hidden Characters:**\n   Sometimes, non-visible characters can be in column names. To check for these, print out the ASCII values of each character in the column names:\n\n   ```python\n   for col in data.columns:\n       print([ord(char) for char in col])\n   ```\n\n5. **Rename the Column:**\n   If you find that the column name is slightly different, you can rename it:\n\n   ```python\n   data.rename(columns={'actual_column_name': 'Number'}, inplace=True)\n   ```\n\n   Replace `'actual_column_name'` with the name you found.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully access the 'Number' column in your DataFrame."
