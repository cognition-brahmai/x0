        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `urllib.parse` is a module available in Python 3, not Python 2. In Python 2, the equivalent functionality is found in the `urlparse` module. Therefore, if you're using Python 2.7.5, you should modify your import statements to use the appropriate module for Python 2.\n\nHere's how you can handle this issue:\n\n1. **Modify the Import Statement:** Instead of `urllib.parse`, use `urlparse` in Python 2. You can modify your import statement as follows:\n\n   ```python\n   try:\n       import urllib.parse as urlparse  # This works in Python 3\n   except ImportError:\n       import urlparse  # This works in Python 2\n   ```\n\n   This code snippet uses a try-except block to import `urlparse` based on the Python version, ensuring compatibility with both Python 2 and 3.\n\n2. **Use Python 2 Syntax:** Adjust your code to use the `urlparse` module from Python 2. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   # In Python 3, you would use:\n   # parsed_url = urllib.parse.urlparse(url)\n\n   # In Python 2, use:\n   parsed_url = urlparse.urlparse(url)\n   ```\n\n3. **Consider Upgrading to Python 3:** Since Python 2 has reached the end of its life, it's recommended to upgrade to Python 3 if possible. This will allow you to use modern libraries and features, including `urllib.parse`.\n\nBy making these changes, you should be able to resolve the `ImportError` and successfully run your REST API on Python 2.7.5."
