The code I am using for testing is:\n\n```python\nfrom theano import function, config, shared, sandbox\nimport theano.tensor as T\nimport numpy\nimport time\n\nvlen = 10 * 30 * 768  # 10 x #cores x # threads per core\niters = 1000\n\nrng = numpy.random.RandomState(22)\nx = shared(numpy.asarray(rng.rand(vlen), config.floatX))\nf = function([], T.exp(x))\nprint(f.maker.fgraph.toposort())\nt0 = time.time()\nfor i in range(iters):\n    r = f()\nt1 = time.time()\nprint(\"Looping %d times took %f seconds\" % (iters, t1 - t0))\nprint(\"Result is %s\" % (r,))\nif numpy.any([isinstance(x.op, T.Elemwise) for x in f.maker.fgraph.toposort()]):\n    print('Used the cpu')\nelse:\n    print('Used the gpu')\n```\nHow can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering indicates that the NVIDIA CUDA Compiler (nvcc) can't find the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler (cl.exe), which is necessary for compiling CUDA code. Here are some steps to help you resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Visual Studio is Installed Correctly**: \n   - Make sure you have the correct version of Visual Studio installed that is compatible with your CUDA version. Typically, CUDA requires a specific version of Visual Studio (e.g., Visual Studio 2019 for CUDA 11.x).\n\n2. **Check the Path for cl.exe**:\n   - Verify the path to `cl.exe`. It is usually located in a directory like `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Community\\VC\\Tools\\MSVC\\<version>\\bin\\Hostx64\\x64`. Adjust the path according to your Visual Studio version.\n\n3. **Update Environment Variables**:\n   - Add the path to `cl.exe` to your system\u2019s PATH environment variable. This can be done by:\n     1. Right-clicking on 'This PC' or 'Computer' on the desktop or in the File Explorer.\n     2. Selecting 'Properties'.\n     3. Clicking on 'Advanced system settings'.\n     4. Clicking on 'Environment Variables'.\n     5. In the 'System variables' section, find and select the 'Path' variable, then click 'Edit'.\n     6. Add the path to the directory containing `cl.exe` to the list.\n\n4. **Set Up the Visual Studio Command Prompt**:\n   - Sometimes, using the Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt can help set the necessary environment variables temporarily for your session. You can launch this from the Start menu under Visual Studio.\n\n5. **Reinstall or Update CUDA Toolkit**:\n   - Ensure that you have the correct version of the CUDA Toolkit installed that matches your hardware and software setup. Sometimes updating or reinstalling can resolve path issues.\n\n6. **Verify Theano and CUDA Configuration**:\n   - Double-check your `.theanorc` file to ensure it is configured to use the GPU. It should look something like:\n     ```ini\n     [global]\n     device = cuda\n     floatX = float32\n\n     [cuda]\n     root = C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v11.2\n     ```\n\n7. **Test CUDA Installation**:\n   - Run the `deviceQuery` and `bandwidthTest` samples provided with the CUDA Toolkit to verify that your CUDA installation is working correctly.\n\n8. **Consult Documentation**:\n   - Always refer to the latest documentation for Theano and CUDA for any additional configuration changes or troubleshooting steps specific to your setup.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error and verify if your GPU is being utilized correctly with Theano and Keras."
