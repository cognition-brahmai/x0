        "content": "Arranging more than two queens on a chessboard such that no queen can capture another is a variation of the classic N-Queens problem. To incorporate pawns and ensure symmetry, you can follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Rules**:\n   - Queens can attack any piece in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Place at least one pawn of each color on the board.\n   - Maintain symmetry in the arrangement.\n\n2. **Symmetrical Arrangement**:\n   - Place queens in a way that mirrors across the center of the board.\n   - This can involve rotational symmetry (180 degrees) or reflective symmetry (across a line).\n\n3. **Algorithm Design**:\n   - Use backtracking to explore all possible arrangements.\n   - Add conditions to ensure no two queens attack each other.\n   - Add constraints for symmetry.\n\n4. **Incorporate Pawns**:\n   - Determine positions for pawns that do not interfere with the queens' constraints.\n\n### SQL Database Code Example:\n\nTo automate the process using SQL for different board sizes and numbers of queens, you can create a table schema and a stored procedure.\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE ChessBoard (\n    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    board_size INT,\n    queens_placement VARCHAR(255),\n    pawns_placement VARCHAR(255)\n);\n\nDELIMITER //\n\nCREATE PROCEDURE ArrangeQueens(\n    IN boardSize INT,\n    IN numQueens INT\n)\nBEGIN\n    DECLARE row INT;\n    DECLARE col INT;\n    DECLARE placement VARCHAR(255);\n    DECLARE symmetricalPlacement VARCHAR(255);\n\n    -- Initialize variables\n    SET row = 1;\n    SET col = 1;\n    SET placement = '';\n    SET symmetricalPlacement = '';\n\n    -- Logic to place queens symmetrically\n    -- (Pseudocode for simplicity, convert this logic to actual SQL or use a procedural language)\n    -- Use nested loops and conditions for backtracking\n\n    -- Pseudocode:\n    -- FOR each row from 1 to boardSize\n    --    FOR each column from 1 to boardSize\n    --        Check if placing queen is safe\n    --        IF safe THEN\n    --            Place queen\n    --            Append position to placement\n    --            Mirror to symmetricalPlacement\n    --        END IF\n    --    END FOR\n    -- END FOR\n\n    -- Insert result into the database\n    INSERT INTO ChessBoard (board_size, queens_placement, pawns_placement)\n    VALUES (boardSize, placement, 'A1 H8'); -- Example pawn positions (modify as needed)\nEND //\n\nDELIMITER ;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **ChessBoard Table**: Stores different configurations of board size, queens' placement, and pawns' placement.\n- **ArrangeQueens Procedure**: Automates the arrangement using backtracking logic (represented as pseudocode). The logic for symmetrical placement is simplified here and would need to be implemented using a procedural language or a SQL-compatible script.\n- **Symmetrical Placement**: Ensure that the queens' positions are mirrored in some way (e.g., A1 mirrors to H8).\n\n### Considerations:\n\n- This example provides a framework. You need to refine the logic for the backtracking algorithm to account for board constraints and symmetry.\n- SQL is not inherently suited for complex algorithmic tasks, so consider using a procedural language like Python or Java in conjunction with the database for more advanced logic handling.\n\nThis setup should get you started with programmatically arranging queens and pawns on a chessboard with your specified constraints."
