Here's a simple function that rounds numbers to the nearest multiple of 5:\n\n```python\ndef round_to_nearest_5(n):\n    return 5 * round(n / 5)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(round_to_nearest_5(10))  # Output: 10\nprint(round_to_nearest_5(12))  # Output: 10\nprint(round_to_nearest_5(13))  # Output: 15\nprint(round_to_nearest_5(14))  # Output: 15\nprint(round_to_nearest_5(16))  # Output: 15\nprint(round_to_nearest_5(18))  # Output: 20\n```\n\nThe function works by dividing the number by 5, rounding it using the built-in `round()` function, and then multiplying the result by 5. This effectively rounds the original number to the nearest multiple of 5."
