After starting the Jupyter server and creating a new notebook with Python3 kernel, I am unable to establish a connection to the kernel. There are no obvious errors in the command line and I have tried accessing it through different browsers including Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge, as well as through PyCharm, all without success. The issue seems to be related to a failure in the websocket connection, as indicated in the js console of the browser. What could be causing this problem?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing with establishing a connection to the Jupyter kernel could be due to several factors. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Check Websocket Support**: Ensure that your browsers have WebSocket support enabled. Most modern browsers support WebSockets, but if there are any security settings or extensions that might be blocking them, you may need to disable those temporarily.\n\n2. **Firewall and Security Software**: Sometimes, firewalls or security software can block WebSocket connections. Try temporarily disabling your firewall or security software to see if that resolves the issue. If it does, you may need to configure the software to allow WebSocket connections to localhost on the port Jupyter is using (usually 8888).\n\n3. **Upgrade Jupyter and Dependencies**: Ensure that Jupyter and its dependencies are up to date. You can upgrade Jupyter and its components using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade jupyter jupyter-client jupyter-core\n   ```\n\n4. **Check Python Environment**: Ensure that your Python environment is properly set up and activated. If you are using virtual environments, make sure the correct environment is activated before launching Jupyter.\n\n5. **Kernel Specifications**: There might be an issue with the kernel specifications. You can try reinstalling the IPython kernel:\n   ```bash\n   python -m pip install --upgrade ipykernel\n   python -m ipykernel install --user\n   ```\n\n6. **Network Configuration**: Check your network configuration, especially if you're on a corporate network that might have restrictions. If you're using a VPN or proxy, try disconnecting them to see if that resolves the issue.\n\n7. **Clear Browser Cache**: Sometimes, clearing the browser cache and cookies can resolve connection issues.\n\n8. **Check Jupyter Logs**: Although you mentioned there are no obvious errors, double-check the Jupyter server logs for any warnings or errors that might give a clue.\n\n9. **Test with a Different Port**: Try starting Jupyter Notebook on a different port to see if the issue is port-specific:\n   ```bash\n   jupyter notebook --port=8889\n   ```\n\n10. **Reinstall Jupyter**: As a last resort, try uninstalling and reinstalling Jupyter:\n    ```bash\n    pip uninstall jupyter\n    pip install jupyter\n    ```\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, consider creating a new environment and installing Jupyter there to see if the problem persists. Additionally, you can check online forums or the Jupyter GitHub repository for any similar issues reported by other users."
