        "content": "As a beginner in programming, I am trying to generate three integers, namely 'a', 'b', and 'c', that satisfy a specific condition in Python 3. The condition is that the sum of 7 times 'a', 5 times 'b', and 3 times 'c' should equal a given number 'n'. If 'n' is 30, then 7*a + 5*b + 3*c should equal 30. I attempted to solve this using nested 'for' loops but it takes too much time to execute and I have a time constraint of 1000 milliseconds. How can I achieve this more efficiently? Here is the code I attempted:\n\n```python\nx = int(input())\nc = []\nk = []\nw = []\nfor i in range(x):\n    for j in range(x):\n        for h in range(x):\n           if 7*i + 5*j + 3*h = x:\n              c.append(i)\n              k.append(j)\n              w.append(h)\nif len(c) == len(k) == len(w): \n    print(-1)\nelse: \n    print(str(k[0]) + ' ' + str(c[0]) + ' ' + str(w[0]))\n```"

        "content": "To improve the efficiency of your solution, you can make use of the fact that iterating through all possible values for `a`, `b`, and `c` is unnecessary. Instead, you can limit the range of your loops based on the maximum possible values for each variable given the constraint `7*a + 5*b + 3*c = x`.\n\nHere's a more efficient approach:\n\n1. Calculate the maximum possible values for `a`, `b`, and `c` based on the given `n`. \n2. Use nested loops, but only iterate up to these maximum values.\n\nHere's an improved version of your code:\n\n```python\nn = int(input())\n\n# Initialize a flag to check if a solution is found\nfound = False\n\n# Calculate the maximum values for a, b, and c\nmax_a = n // 7\nmax_b = n // 5\nmax_c = n // 3\n\nfor a in range(max_a + 1):\n    for b in range(max_b + 1):\n        # Calculate c directly to satisfy the equation\n        remaining = n - (7 * a + 5 * b)\n        \n        # Check if the remaining value is non-negative and divisible by 3\n        if remaining >= 0 and remaining % 3 == 0:\n            c = remaining // 3\n            print(a, b, c)\n            found = True\n            break\n    if found:\n        break\n\n# If no solution is found, print -1\nif not found:\n    print(-1)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We first calculate the maximum values for `a`, `b`, and `c` based on `n`, which greatly reduces the number of iterations needed.\n- Instead of iterating over `c`, we calculate it directly using the remaining value after subtracting `7*a + 5*b` from `n`.\n- We check if the remaining value is non-negative and divisible by 3 to ensure `c` is an integer.\n- As soon as a valid solution is found, we break out of the loops and print the result. If no solution is found, we print `-1`."
