I want to select the name and age from the person table where the id is in the employee table and the company in the employee table is 'Private'. I have tried the following code:\n\n```python\nPerson.objects.value('name', 'age')\nEmployee.objects.filter(company='Private')\n```\nHowever, this is not working as it returns two outputs. How can I modify this to get the desired result?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired result using a subquery in Django's queryset, you can make use of Django's `Subquery` and `OuterRef` features. These allow you to perform operations similar to SQL subqueries. Here's how you can modify your code to select the `name` and `age` from the `Person` table where the `id` is in the `Employee` table and the `company` is 'Private':\n\n```python\nfrom django.db.models import Subquery, OuterRef\n\n# First, filter the Employee table for the desired company\nemployee_subquery = Employee.objects.filter(\n    company='Private',\n    id=OuterRef('id')  # Use OuterRef to refer to the id in the Person model\n).values('id')\n\n# Now, filter the Person table using the subquery\npersons = Person.objects.filter(\n    id__in=Subquery(employee_subquery)\n).values('name', 'age')\n\nfor person in persons:\n    print(person)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `OuterRef('id')` is used to refer to the `id` field of the `Person` model within the subquery.\n- `Subquery(employee_subquery)` is used to filter the `Person` queryset based on whether the `id` is present in the filtered `Employee` queryset.\n- `.values('name', 'age')` is used to retrieve only the `name` and `age` fields from the `Person` queryset.\n\nThis should give you a queryset of `Person` instances whose `id` appears in the filtered `Employee` queryset where the `company` is 'Private'."
