The `ord()` function takes a string of a single character as an argument and returns an integer representing its Unicode code point.\n\nHere's an example of how to use `ord()`:\n\n```python\ncharacter = 'A'\ncode_point = ord(character)\nprint(\"The Unicode code point of '{}' is: {}\".format(character, code_point))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nThe Unicode code point of 'A' is: 65\n```\n\nYou can use this method for any single character to get its Unicode code point."
