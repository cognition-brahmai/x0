        "content": "Adding new functionalities to a report-generating product can enhance its usability and appeal. Let's break down the features you're interested in and provide some guidance on how to implement them in Python.\n\n### 1. Exporting Reports in Different Languages\n\nTo allow users to export reports in different languages, you can utilize translation libraries in Python. One popular library for this purpose is `googletrans`, which provides an interface to Google Translate.\n\n#### Example Code:\n```python\nfrom googletrans import Translator\n\ndef translate_report(report_text, target_language):\n    translator = Translator()\n    translated = translator.translate(report_text, dest=target_language)\n    return translated.text\n\n# Example usage\noriginal_report = \"This is a sample report.\"\ntranslated_report = translate_report(original_report, 'fr')  # 'fr' for French\nprint(translated_report)\n```\n\n### 2. Collaborative Editing of Reports in Real-Time\n\nFor real-time collaborative editing, you would typically need a backend service that handles synchronization between multiple users. Socket programming or WebSockets can be used to achieve this. A popular library for WebSockets in Python is `websockets`.\n\n#### Example Code:\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport websockets\n\nconnected_users = set()\n\nasync def handler(websocket, path):\n    connected_users.add(websocket)\n    try:\n        async for message in websocket:\n            # Broadcast the incoming message to all connected users\n            await asyncio.wait([user.send(message) for user in connected_users if user != websocket])\n    finally:\n        connected_users.remove(websocket)\n\nstart_server = websockets.serve(handler, \"localhost\", 6789)\n\nasyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(start_server)\nasyncio.get_event_loop().run_forever()\n```\n\nThis is a basic example where the server broadcasts any received message to all connected clients, enabling real-time collaboration.\n\n### 3. Ensuring Stable System Performance\n\nTo maintain system stability while adding new features, consider the following:\n\n- **Concurrency and Parallelism**: Use Python's `asyncio` for handling I/O-bound tasks concurrently. For CPU-bound tasks, you might want to use `concurrent.futures` or multiprocessing.\n  \n- **Efficient Resource Management**: Implement caching using libraries like `functools.lru_cache` or `redis` to reduce redundant operations and improve performance.\n\n- **Profiling and Monitoring**: Use tools like `cProfile` to identify bottlenecks in your code and optimize them.\n\n- **Testing**: Implement unit tests and integration tests using frameworks like `unittest` or `pytest` to ensure new features do not break existing functionalities.\n\nHere's a basic example of using `asyncio` to handle multiple translation requests concurrently:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nfrom googletrans import Translator\n\nasync def translate_text(text, dest_lang):\n    translator = Translator()\n    translated = translator.translate(text, dest=dest_lang)\n    return translated.text\n\nasync def main():\n    texts = [\"Hello\", \"World\", \"Test\"]\n    tasks = [translate_text(text, 'es') for text in texts]  # 'es' for Spanish\n    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Run the event loop\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nBy employing these techniques, you can effectively add new features to your report-generating product while ensuring it remains performant and stable."
