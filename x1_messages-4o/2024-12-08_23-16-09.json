        "content": "To determine the pattern in the given sequence of numbers (2, 3, 5, 9, 17, 33), let's first examine the differences between consecutive terms, as this can often reveal an underlying pattern.\n\n1. The difference between 3 and 2 is 1.\n2. The difference between 5 and 3 is 2.\n3. The difference between 9 and 5 is 4.\n4. The difference between 17 and 9 is 8.\n5. The difference between 33 and 17 is 16.\n\nObserving these differences, we get the sequence: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. This sequence is a series of powers of 2.\n\n1. \\(2^0 = 1\\)\n2. \\(2^1 = 2\\)\n3. \\(2^2 = 4\\)\n4. \\(2^3 = 8\\)\n5. \\(2^4 = 16\\)\n\nThe differences between consecutive terms are doubling each time, following the pattern of powers of 2.\n\nTo find the next number in the sequence, we can calculate the next difference, which would be \\(2^5 = 32\\).\n\nAdding this difference to the last number in the given sequence:\n\\[ 33 + 32 = 65 \\]\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is 65.\n\nThe rule for the sequence can be summarized as starting with the initial term 2, and each subsequent term is calculated by adding successive powers of 2 to the previous term."
