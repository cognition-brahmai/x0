        "content": "Certainly! Let's break down the steps to convert octal numbers to binary using only bitwise operators and ensure the binary numbers are 8-bits long with leading zeros. Following that, we'll delve into Two's Complement representation and provide a Swift code example.\n\n### Octal to Binary Conversion Using Bitwise Operators\n\n**Step-by-Step Guide:**\n\n1. **Understand Octal and Binary:**\n   - Octal numbers are base-8, using digits 0-7.\n   - Binary numbers are base-2, using digits 0 and 1.\n\n2. **Initialize Variables:**\n   - Start with your octal number. For example, let's use `345` (octal).\n\n3. **Convert Each Octal Digit to Binary:**\n   - Convert each octal digit to its 3-bit binary equivalent.\n   - For example, octal digit `3` is `011` in binary, `4` is `100`, and `5` is `101`.\n\n4. **Combine Binary Digits:**\n   - Concatenate the binary equivalents: `011 100 101`.\n\n5. **Ensure 8-Bit Length:**\n   - If the binary number is less than 8 bits, pad it with leading zeros.\n   - In this case, `011100101` is already 9 bits, but if you had a shorter number, you'd pad it.\n\n**Bitwise Operation Approach:**\n\nUnfortunately, using bitwise operations alone to convert directly from octal to binary isn't straightforward without iterative logic. Bitwise operators like AND, OR, XOR, and NOT are more suited for bit manipulation rather than direct conversion between numeral systems. However, you can use them to manipulate bits once converted.\n\n### Two's Complement Representation\n\n**Concept:**\n\n- **Two's Complement** is a method for representing signed integers in binary.\n- The most significant bit (MSB) indicates the sign (0 for positive, 1 for negative).\n- To find the Two's Complement of a number:\n  1. Invert all bits (perform NOT operation).\n  2. Add 1 to the least significant bit (LSB).\n\n**Relevance:**\n\n- It simplifies binary arithmetic, enabling addition and subtraction to be performed using the same circuitry.\n- Eliminates the need for separate subtraction logic in hardware.\n- Aids in representing negative numbers in a form compatible with binary arithmetic operations.\n\n**Real-World Example:**\n\nSuppose you need to subtract 5 from 3. In Two's Complement:\n\n1. Representation of `5` is `00000101`.\n2. Invert bits: `11111010`.\n3. Add 1: `11111011` (this is `-5` in Two's Complement).\n\nNow, adding `3` (`00000011`) to `-5` (`11111011`):\n\n```\n  00000011\n+ 11111011\n-----------\n  11111110\n```\n\nThe result is `-2`, which is `11111110` in Two's Complement.\n\n### Swift Code Example\n\nHere's a simple Swift program demonstrating Two's Complement:\n\n```swift\nfunc toTwosComplement(_ number: Int8) -> Int8 {\n    return ~number &+ 1\n}\n\nfunc binaryRepresentation(of number: Int8) -> String {\n    var binaryString = \"\"\n    for i in (0..<8).reversed() {\n        let bit = (number >> i) & 1\n        binaryString += \"\\(bit)\"\n    }\n    return binaryString\n}\n\nlet positiveNumber: Int8 = 5\nlet negativeTwosComplement = toTwosComplement(positiveNumber)\n\nprint(\"Binary of \\(positiveNumber):\", binaryRepresentation(of: positiveNumber))\nprint(\"Two's Complement of -\\(positiveNumber):\", binaryRepresentation(of: negativeTwosComplement))\n\nlet subtractedResult: Int8 = 3 &+ negativeTwosComplement\nprint(\"3 + (-5) in binary:\", binaryRepresentation(of: subtractedResult))\nprint(\"Result in decimal:\", subtractedResult)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- `toTwosComplement` function calculates the Two's Complement of a given number.\n- `binaryRepresentation` function converts a number to its binary string representation.\n- The program demonstrates converting a positive number to its Two's Complement, performing arithmetic, and representing results in binary.\n\nThis code showcases how Two's Complement is used in arithmetic operations in computer systems."
