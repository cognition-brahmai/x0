        "content": "Certainly! To find the AWS Account ID using Boto3, you can use the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service to retrieve the account information. Here's a step-by-step guide and a sample Python script that shows how to achieve this:\n\n1. **Install Boto3**: Ensure that Boto3 is installed in your Python environment. If it's not installed, you can install it using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install boto3\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a session**: Use the credentials you have to create a session with Boto3.\n\n3. **Call the `get_caller_identity` API**: Use the `sts` (Security Token Service) client to call the `get_caller_identity` method, which returns details about the IAM user or role whose credentials are used to call the operation.\n\nHere's a sample script to get the AWS Account ID:\n\n```python\nimport boto3\n\ndef get_account_id():\n    # Create a session using your credentials\n    session = boto3.Session(\n        aws_access_key_id='YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID',\n        aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'\n    )\n\n    # Create an STS client\n    sts_client = session.client('sts')\n\n    # Call the get_caller_identity method\n    response = sts_client.get_caller_identity()\n\n    # Extract the Account ID from the response\n    account_id = response['Account']\n    \n    return account_id\n\n# Get and print the AWS Account ID\naccount_id = get_account_id()\nprint(f\"AWS Account ID: {account_id}\")\n```\n\nReplace `'YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'` and `'YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'` with your actual AWS credentials. This script will print out the AWS Account ID associated with the credentials you provided.\n\nRemember to handle your credentials securely and avoid hardcoding them directly in your scripts for production environments. Consider using environment variables or AWS IAM roles with appropriate permissions when deploying applications on AWS resources."
