        "content": "To create a function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the n-th term, you can use a simple iterative approach or a recursive one. Here's a straightforward way to do it using an iterative approach in Python:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci_sequence(n):\n    if n <= 0:\n        return \"Please enter a positive integer\"\n    elif n == 1:\n        return [0]\n    elif n == 2:\n        return [0, 1]\n    \n    sequence = [0, 1]\n    for i in range(2, n):\n        next_value = sequence[i - 1] + sequence[i - 2]\n        sequence.append(next_value)\n    \n    return sequence\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 10\nprint(f\"Fibonacci sequence up to the {n}-th term: {fibonacci_sequence(n)}\")\n```\n\nThis function begins by checking if `n` is less than or equal to 0, which is not a valid input for generating a sequence. For `n = 1`, it returns a list containing only the first Fibonacci number, 0. For `n = 2`, it returns the first two Fibonacci numbers, 0 and 1.\n\nFor values of `n` greater than 2, it initializes a list, `sequence`, with the first two Fibonacci numbers and then iteratively calculates the next numbers in the sequence by summing the two preceding numbers. This continues until the list contains `n` elements."
