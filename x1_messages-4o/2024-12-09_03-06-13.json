Essentially, the method decorators would flag some of the methods as special with a dummy value and then the class decorator would fill in the value later. Here's a simplified version of my code:\n\n```python\nclass cow:\n   def moo(self):\n       print 'mooo'\n   moo.thing = 10\n\nprint(cow.moo.thing)\nprint(cow().moo.thing)\n\ncow.moo.thing = 5\ncow().moo.thing = 5\ncow.moo.__func__.thing = 5\n\nprint(cow.moo.thing)\n```\n\nWhen I try to modify the attribute `thing` of `moo` method, I am getting an `AttributeError: 'instancemethod' object has no attribute 'thing'`. However, `cow.moo.thing` does return 10 as expected. Also, setting `cow.moo.__func__.thing = 5` seems to work, but I am not sure why. Could you explain why `cow.moo.thing = 5` does not work but `cow.moo.__func__.thing = 5` does?"

        "content": "In Python 2.x, methods in classes are bound or unbound methods. This is important when you're dealing with attributes on methods.\n\n1. **Bound vs Unbound Methods**:\n   - `cow.moo` is an unbound method because it is accessed through the class itself.\n   - `cow().moo` is a bound method because it is accessed through an instance of the class.\n\n2. **Attribute Access**:\n   - When you access `cow.moo`, you're accessing the method as it is defined on the class. You can directly set attributes on this, such as `cow.moo.thing = 10`.\n   - When you access `cow().moo`, you're dealing with a bound method, which is essentially a wrapper around the function and the instance. This wrapper does not automatically inherit attributes from the unbound method or the function itself.\n\n3. **Function Object**:\n   - The actual function object of a method can be accessed via `__func__` in Python 2.x. This is why `cow.moo.__func__.thing = 5` works. You're setting the attribute on the function object itself, which is shared by all instances.\n\n4. **AttributeError**:\n   - When you try `cow().moo.thing = 5`, it results in an `AttributeError` because you're trying to set an attribute on the bound method object, which doesn\u2019t support arbitrary attributes.\n\nIn summary, `cow.moo.thing = 5` works because you're setting an attribute on the class's method directly. `cow().moo.thing = 5` doesn't work because you're attempting to set an attribute on the bound method wrapper, which doesn\u2019t allow storing arbitrary attributes. However, `cow.moo.__func__.thing = 5` works because you're setting an attribute on the function object, which is shared across all instances.\n\nIf you're working in a Python 3 environment, note that this behavior changes due to unification of method and function handling, and you'll be dealing with attributes on the function objects directly without the bound/unbound distinction."
