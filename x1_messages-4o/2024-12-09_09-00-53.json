        "content": "Certainly! Calculating the power of two numbers can be optimized using the concept of exponentiation by squaring, which reduces the number of multiplications required. Here's an example in Python:\n\n```python\ndef power(base, exponent):\n    result = 1\n    while exponent > 0:\n        if exponent % 2 == 1:  # If the exponent is odd\n            result *= base\n        base *= base\n        exponent //= 2\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nbase = 2\nexponent = 10\nprint(power(base, exponent))  # Output: 1024\n```\n\nThis function works by continuously squaring the base and reducing the exponent by half in each iteration. If the exponent is odd, it multiplies the current result by the base. This method significantly reduces the number of multiplications compared to the naive approach, especially for large exponents."
