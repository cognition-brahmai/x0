Use `os.listdir()` to list all entries in the directory.\n2. Use `os.path.isdir()` to check if each entry is a directory.\n3. Filter out directories that meet your criteria (e.g., exceptions).\n\nHere's a sample script demonstrating how to get all immediate subdirectories:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef get_immediate_subdirectories(dir_path, exceptions=None):\n    if exceptions is None:\n        exceptions = []\n        \n    # List all entries in the directory\n    entries = os.listdir(dir_path)\n    \n    # Filter and get subdirectories\n    subdirectories = [\n        os.path.join(dir_path, entry)\n        for entry in entries\n        if os.path.isdir(os.path.join(dir_path, entry)) and entry not in exceptions\n    ]\n    \n    return subdirectories\n\n# Example usage\ndirectory_path = '/path/to/your/directory'\nexceptions = ['exclude_this_directory', 'another_exclusion']\nsubdirs = get_immediate_subdirectories(directory_path, exceptions)\n\nprint(\"Immediate subdirectories:\")\nfor subdir in subdirs:\n    print(subdir)\n```\n\nModify the `directory_path` to the path of your directory and `exceptions` to include any directories you want to exclude from the list. This script will print out the paths of all immediate subdirectories, excluding any specified in the exceptions list."
