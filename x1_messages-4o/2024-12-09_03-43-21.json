        "content": "Yes, Python provides a straightforward way to check if a given string is a substring of another string using the `in` keyword. This is a built-in functionality that makes it easy to perform this check without needing to use any additional libraries or complex code. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Define the strings\nmain_string = \"Hello, welcome to the world of Python!\"\nsubstring = \"welcome\"\n\n# Check if the substring is in the main string\nif substring in main_string:\n    print(f\"'{substring}' is a substring of the main string.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"'{substring}' is not a substring of the main string.\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `in` keyword is used to check if `substring` is present in `main_string`. If it is, the condition evaluates to `True`; otherwise, it evaluates to `False`.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the `find()` method, which returns the lowest index of the substring if it is found in the string, or `-1` if it is not found:\n\n```python\n# Using the find() method\nindex = main_string.find(substring)\n\nif index != -1:\n    print(f\"'{substring}' is a substring of the main string, starting at index {index}.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"'{substring}' is not a substring of the main string.\")\n```\n\nBoth methods are efficient and commonly used for checking substrings in Python."
