Currently, I am able to create two separate scalar summaries for each of them individually, but this puts them on separate graphs. I want them on the same graph to easily see the gap between them and identify if they have begun to diverge due to overfitting. Is there a built-in method to achieve this or any workaround?"

        "content": "Yes, you can plot both the training and validation losses on the same graph in TensorBoard by using the same tag name for both the training and validation loss summaries. By doing this, TensorBoard will plot them on the same graph, allowing you to compare them directly.\n\nHere's a general approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Logging the Losses:** When you log your losses, make sure to use the same tag name for both the training and validation losses. You can differentiate them by using different global steps or additional information in the tag name if needed.\n\n2. **Example in TensorFlow:**\n\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n\n   # Create a summary writer\n   writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(log_dir)\n\n   for step in range(num_steps):\n       # Calculate training and validation losses\n       train_loss = ...\n       val_loss = ...\n\n       with writer.as_default():\n           # Log the training loss with a specific tag\n           tf.summary.scalar('loss', train_loss, step=step)\n\n           # Log the validation loss with the same tag\n           tf.summary.scalar('loss', val_loss, step=step)\n\n       writer.flush()\n   ```\n\n3. **Visualizing in TensorBoard:** When you run TensorBoard and navigate to the Scalars tab, you'll see a single plot with both the training and validation losses plotted together. This allows you to easily compare the two and observe any divergence that might indicate overfitting.\n\nRemember, when you use the same tag, TensorBoard will plot all series with that tag on the same graph. You can differentiate them by using the legend that TensorBoard automatically provides, based on the run name or any additional information you include in the tag.\n\nAdditionally, if you are using a framework like Keras, you can achieve similar functionality by using callbacks and modifying the names of the metrics logged."
