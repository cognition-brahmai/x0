An obvious way to do it would be:\n\n```python\nif len(the_list) > i:\n    return the_list[i]\nelse:\n    return None\n```\n\nHowever, this method is verbose and reduces code readability. Is there a one-liner that can be used instead?"

Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nvalue = the_list[i] if i < len(the_list) else None\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `try-except` block in a one-liner like this:\n\n```python\nvalue = the_list[i] if i < len(the_list) else None\n```\n\nBoth methods are concise and maintain readability, allowing you to retrieve the value at index `i` or return `None` if the index is out of range."
