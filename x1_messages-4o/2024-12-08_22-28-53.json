Here's how you can do it:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    for(int i = 1; i <= 20; i++) {\n        if(i % 2 != 0 && i % 3 != 0) {\n            cout << i << \" \";\n        }\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this modified code, the condition `i % 2 != 0` checks if the number is odd, and `i % 3 != 0` ensures the number is not divisible by 3. If both conditions are true, the number is printed."
