Also, when checking if 'a' is 'b', it returns False, but 'a' equals 'b' returns True. Can I infer that unequal objects may have the same hash values, equal objects need to have the same id values, and whenever 'obj1 is obj2' is called, the id values of both objects are compared, not their hash values?"

        "content": "In Python, the `hash()` and `id()` functions serve different purposes and provide different information about objects:\n\n1. **`hash()` Function:**\n   - The `hash()` function returns an integer hash value for an object, which is used in hashing operations, like when storing objects in a set or as keys in a dictionary.\n   - Hash values are used to quickly compare dictionary keys during a dictionary lookup.\n   - Two objects that are considered equal (i.e., `a == b` is `True`) should have the same hash value. However, it is possible for unequal objects to have the same hash value (this is known as a hash collision).\n   - The `hash()` function is only applicable to hashable objects. Mutable objects like lists and dictionaries are not hashable.\n\n2. **`id()` Function:**\n   - The `id()` function returns a unique identifier for an object, which is constant for the object during its lifetime.\n   - The `id()` often corresponds to the memory address of the object, although this is an implementation detail and may vary between Python implementations.\n   - Two objects can have different `id` values even if they are equal (`a == b`), as they may be distinct objects in memory.\n\nRegarding your observations:\n- When two different objects `a` and `b` have the same hash value but different `id` values, it demonstrates that hash collisions can occur, and that objects can be distinct in memory while still having equal hash values.\n- When `a is b` returns `False`, it indicates that `a` and `b` are different objects in memory (i.e., they have different `id` values). The `is` operator checks for object identity.\n- When `a == b` returns `True`, it means `a` and `b` are considered equal in terms of their content or value, as determined by the `__eq__` method for those objects.\n\nFrom this, you can infer:\n- Unequal objects can have the same hash values due to hash collisions.\n- Equal objects (in terms of value) do not need to have the same `id` values, as they can be separate instances.\n- The `is` operator checks whether two references point to the exact same object by comparing their `id` values, not their hash values."
