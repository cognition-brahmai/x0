However, I want to specify a virtualenv to ensure that navigation/autocomplete works with packages within that virtualenv. I attempted to do this in settings.py, and also tried setting \"python.pythonPath\":\"~/dev/venvs/proj/bin/python, but neither of these methods worked. The autocomplete/navigation functionality was killed in the process. Here's the code I used:\n\n```\n{\n    \"python.autoComplete.extraPaths\": [\n        \"~/dev/venvs/proj\",\n        \"~/dev/venvs/proj/lib\"\n     ]\n}\n```"

        "content": "To use a virtual environment with Python in Visual Studio Code and ensure that navigation and autocomplete work correctly, you need to set up the virtual environment properly in VS Code. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieving this:\n\n1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**\n   If you haven't already created a virtual environment, you can do so with the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m venv ~/dev/venvs/proj\n   ```\n\n   This command will create a virtual environment named `proj` in the `~/dev/venvs` directory.\n\n2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**\n   You need to activate the virtual environment so that the terminal in VS Code uses the correct Python interpreter. Depending on your operating system, use one of the following commands:\n\n   - **On macOS/Linux:**\n\n     ```bash\n     source ~/dev/venvs/proj/bin/activate\n     ```\n\n   - **On Windows:**\n\n     ```bash\n     .\\venvs\\proj\\Scripts\\activate\n     ```\n\n3. **Open Visual Studio Code:**\n   Open your project in Visual Studio Code. You can open the terminal in VS Code by going to `View -> Terminal` or using the shortcut ``Ctrl+` ``.\n\n4. **Select the Python Interpreter:**\n   To specify the virtual environment as the interpreter, do the following:\n\n   - Open the Command Palette (you can use `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).\n   - Type and select `Python: Select Interpreter`.\n   - You should see a list of available interpreters. Look for the one that points to your virtual environment (`~/dev/venvs/proj/bin/python`), and select it.\n\n5. **Verify the Interpreter:**\n   Ensure that the selected interpreter is the one from your virtual environment. You can check the current Python interpreter in the bottom-left corner of the VS Code window. It should display the path to your virtual environment's Python executable.\n\n6. **Configure `settings.json`:**\n   You can specify additional paths for the autocomplete if necessary, but if the interpreter is set correctly, it should automatically recognize the packages installed in the virtual environment. However, if needed, you can adjust your `settings.json` like so:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n       \"python.pythonPath\": \"~/dev/venvs/proj/bin/python\",\n       \"python.autoComplete.extraPaths\": [\n           \"~/dev/venvs/proj/lib/python3.x/site-packages\"\n       ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Replace `python3.x` with the version of Python you are using (e.g., `python3.9`).\n\n7. **Install Required Packages:**\n   Ensure that all necessary packages are installed in the virtual environment using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install <package-name>\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should have a fully functional setup where navigation and autocomplete work as expected within your virtual environment in Visual Studio Code."
