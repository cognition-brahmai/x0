The sklearn tutorial provides a way to count term frequency of words to feed into the LDA with the built-in stop words feature, but it seems to only be available for English. How can I use my own stop words list for this? The code I currently have is:\n\n```python\ntf_vectorizer = CountVectorizer(max_df=0.95, min_df=2,\n                                max_features=n_features,\n                                stop_words='english')\n```"

        "content": "To use a custom list of stop words with `CountVectorizer` in `scikit-learn`, you simply need to pass your list of stop words to the `stop_words` parameter. This allows you to handle non-English text datasets effectively by providing a tailored list of words that you want to exclude from the analysis.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to include a custom list of stop words:\n\n```python\n# Define your custom stop words list\ncustom_stop_words = ['word1', 'word2', 'word3', ...]  # Replace with actual stop words\n\n# Initialize CountVectorizer with custom stop words\ntf_vectorizer = CountVectorizer(max_df=0.95, min_df=2,\n                                max_features=n_features,\n                                stop_words=custom_stop_words)\n\n# Fit and transform your data\ntf = tf_vectorizer.fit_transform(your_text_data)\n\n# Proceed with LDA\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import LatentDirichletAllocation\n\nlda = LatentDirichletAllocation(n_components=n_topics, random_state=0)\nlda.fit(tf)\n```\n\n### Steps to Implement:\n\n1. **Define Custom Stop Words**: Create a list of words that you want to exclude from your analysis. These could be common words in your specific language or context that don't contribute meaningful information to the model.\n\n2. **Initialize `CountVectorizer`**: Pass your custom stop words list to the `stop_words` parameter in `CountVectorizer`.\n\n3. **Fit-Transform Your Data**: Use the `fit_transform` method on your dataset to convert your text data into a document-term matrix, ready for LDA processing.\n\n4. **Proceed with LDA**: Use the transformed data to fit the `LatentDirichletAllocation` model as you normally would.\n\nBy customizing the stop words, you ensure that the LDA model focuses on more relevant terms in your non-English text dataset."
