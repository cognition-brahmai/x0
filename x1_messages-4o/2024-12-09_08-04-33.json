I have tried the following two approaches:\n\n```bash\n[[ \"$(type -t deactivate)\" != function ]]; INVENV=$?\n```\n\nand\n\n```bash\n[[ \"x$(which python)\" != \"x$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/python\" ]]; INVENV=$?\n```\n\nI want `$INVENV` to be 1 if we're inside a virtual environment, and 0 otherwise. Is there a less hacky way to do this?"

This variable is automatically set when you activate a virtual environment and unset when you deactivate it.\n\nHere's a cleaner way to implement this check:\n\n```bash\nif [[ -n \"$VIRTUAL_ENV\" ]]; then\n  INVENV=1\nelse\n  INVENV=0\nfi\n```\n\nIn this approach:\n- `[[ -n \"$VIRTUAL_ENV\" ]]` checks if the `VIRTUAL_ENV` variable is non-empty, which indicates that a virtual environment is activated.\n- If `VIRTUAL_ENV` is set, `INVENV` is set to 1, indicating that you are inside a virtual environment.\n- Otherwise, `INVENV` is set to 0, indicating that you are not in a virtual environment.\n\nThis method is less hacky and more direct, as it relies on the standard behavior of virtual environments setting the `VIRTUAL_ENV` variable."
