        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is that the `TextTestRunner`'s `run()` method doesn't automatically call `sys.exit()` with a non-zero status code when tests fail. The `TextTestRunner` will return a `TestResult` object, which contains information about the test execution, including the number of errors and failures. You need to manually check the result and exit with the appropriate status code.\n\nHere's how you can modify your script to ensure it exits with the correct code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nfrom unittest import defaultTestLoader as loader, TextTestRunner\n\npath_to_my_project = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) + '/../'\nsys.path.insert(0, path_to_my_project)\n\nsuite = loader.discover('my_project')\nrunner = TextTestRunner()\nresult = runner.run(suite)\n\n# Exit with a non-zero code if there were any failures or errors\nif not result.wasSuccessful():\n    sys.exit(1)\n\nsys.exit(0)\n```\n\nIn this modified script, after running the tests, the `result.wasSuccessful()` method is called to check if there were any failures or errors. If any tests failed, it exits with a status code of `1`, indicating failure. Otherwise, it exits with `0`, indicating success."
