        "content": "To add minor gridlines to your plot using the Seaborn package in Matplotlib, you will need to enable minor ticks on your axes and then configure the minor gridlines accordingly. By default, Matplotlib does not show minor ticks or gridlines, so you need to explicitly set them.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to show minor gridlines and adjust their style:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sbn\n\n# Sample data\nx = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)\ny = np.sin(x)\n\n# Create the plot\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1)\nax.scatter(x, y)\n\n# Enable minor ticks\nax.minorticks_on()\n\n# Customize the major and minor gridlines\nax.grid(b=True, which='major', color='b', linestyle='-', linewidth=0.5)\nax.grid(b=True, which='minor', color='r', linestyle=':', linewidth=0.5)\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Enable Minor Ticks**: Use `ax.minorticks_on()` to enable minor ticks on the axes.\n\n2. **Customize Gridlines**:\n   - You can specify the color, linestyle, and linewidth for both major and minor gridlines. In the example above, major gridlines are blue with a solid line, and minor gridlines are red with a dotted line.\n   \n3. **Adjust the Style**: You can further customize the style and appearance of the gridlines by changing the parameters in the `ax.grid()` function calls.\n\nThese changes will help in displaying minor gridlines and allow you to customize their appearance to make them narrower or different from the major gridlines.\n\nIf you want to further refine the gridline appearance, you can explore additional styling options available in Matplotlib and Seaborn."
