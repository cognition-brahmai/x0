        "content": "I am trying to split a string into words and punctuation, with punctuation being added to the list produced by the split. When I use Python's `split()` function, it splits the string but does not separate the punctuation from the words. For instance, when I split the string \"help, me\", it gives me `['help,', 'me']`, but I want the list to look like `['help', ',', 'me']`. I attempted to parse the string first to separate punctuation from the words, and then ran the `split()` function which gave me the desired output. However, this approach is very slow for large files. Is there a more efficient way to do this?"

        "content": "To efficiently split a string into words and punctuation in Python, you can use regular expressions with the `re` module. The regular expressions allow you to define patterns for splitting the string more precisely than the `split()` function. Here's a way to achieve the desired output:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef split_string_with_punctuation(input_string):\n    # Use a regular expression to match words and punctuation separately\n    pattern = r'\\w+|[^\\w\\s]'\n    # Find all matches in the input string\n    return re.findall(pattern, input_string)\n\n# Example usage\ninput_string = \"help, me\"\nresult = split_string_with_punctuation(input_string)\nprint(result)  # Output: ['help', ',', 'me']\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `\\w+` matches sequences of alphanumeric characters (words).\n- `[^\\w\\s]` matches any character that is not a word character or a whitespace character, effectively capturing punctuation.\n- The `re.findall()` function will find all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string, returning them as a list.\n\nThis approach should be efficient and work well even with large files, as regular expressions are optimized for pattern matching tasks like this."
