Now, I need to identify the top three clusters based on their size, i.e., the number of data points in each cluster. How do I obtain the size of each cluster in sklearn? Here's the code I've used so far:\n\n```python\n#Apply DBSCAN (sims == my data as list of lists)\ndb1 = DBSCAN(min_samples=1, metric='precomputed').fit(sims)\n\ndb1_labels = db1.labels_\ndb1n_clusters_ = len(set(db1_labels)) - (1 if -1 in db1_labels else 0)\n#Returns the number of clusters (E.g., 10 clusters)\nprint('Estimated number of clusters: %d' % db1n_clusters_)\n```"

Count the number of data points in each cluster.\n2. Sort the clusters by size.\n3. Extract the top three clusters.\n\nHere's how you can do it in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Your existing DBSCAN code\ndb1 = DBSCAN(min_samples=1, metric='precomputed').fit(sims)\ndb1_labels = db1.labels_\n\n# Count the number of elements in each cluster\ncluster_sizes = Counter(db1_labels)\n\n# Remove the noise points if there are any (-1 label)\nif -1 in cluster_sizes:\n    del cluster_sizes[-1]\n\n# Sort clusters by size in descending order\nsorted_clusters = sorted(cluster_sizes.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n\n# Extract the top three clusters\ntop_three_clusters = sorted_clusters[:3]\n\n# Print the top three clusters and their sizes\nprint(\"Top three clusters by size:\")\nfor cluster_label, size in top_three_clusters:\n    print(f\"Cluster {cluster_label}: {size} points\")\n```\n\nThis code will give you the labels of the top three clusters and the number of data points in each. The `Counter` class is used to count the occurrences of each label (which represents a cluster), and then you sort these counts to find the largest clusters."
