        "content": "To improve the efficiency of a Fibonacci sequence generator using memoization, you can store the results of each Fibonacci calculation so that they can be reused in future calculations. This approach reduces the time complexity from exponential to linear by avoiding redundant calculations. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide and a sample implementation in Python:\n\n1. **Understand Recursion with Fibonacci**: The naive recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence can be very inefficient because it recalculates the same values multiple times.\n\n2. **Use a Dictionary for Caching**: You can use a dictionary to store previously computed Fibonacci numbers. This dictionary acts as a cache to store results that can be reused.\n\n3. **Modify the Recursive Function**: Before computing the Fibonacci number for a given index, check if it\u2019s already in the cache. If it is, return that value. If not, compute the value, store it in the cache, and then return it.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n, cache={}):\n    # If the value has been computed, return it from the cache\n    if n in cache:\n        return cache[n]\n    \n    # Base cases\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Recursive computation with memoization\n    cache[n] = fibonacci(n-1, cache) + fibonacci(n-2, cache)\n    return cache[n]\n\n# Example usage\nn = 10\nprint(f\"Fibonacci({n}) = {fibonacci(n)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Base Cases**: The base cases handle `fibonacci(0)` and `fibonacci(1)`, which are defined to be 0 and 1, respectively.\n- **Cache Check**: Before performing the recursive calculation, the function checks if the result for `n` is already in the cache.\n- **Recursive Calls**: If not cached, the function calculates the Fibonacci number by summing the results of the two preceding numbers.\n- **Storing in Cache**: The newly computed Fibonacci number is stored in the cache for future use.\n\n### Benefits of Memoization:\n- **Improved Time Complexity**: The time complexity is reduced from O(2^n) to O(n), as each Fibonacci number is computed only once.\n- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage required for the cache.\n\nBy using memoization, you can make your Fibonacci sequence generator more efficient, especially for larger values of `n`."
