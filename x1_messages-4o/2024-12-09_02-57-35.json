Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport fractions\n\nx = fractions.Fraction(4, 1)\ndenominator = x.denominator\nprint(denominator)\n```\n\nThis will output `1`, which is the denominator of the fraction `4/1`. The `denominator` attribute directly gives you the denominator of the `Fraction` object."
