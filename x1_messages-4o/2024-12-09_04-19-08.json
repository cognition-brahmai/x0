I am trying to run the command `model = 'User' [in Django namespace]` and then `model.objects.all()`. However, I am getting an error that says \"global name django is not defined.\" when I try to use `model = django.authx.models.User` instead. Is there a way to make this work without the import statement and without Django returning an error?"

        "content": "To dynamically retrieve a Django model class without having the full module path, you can use Django's `apps` registry. This allows you to access models by their app label and model name. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Use Django's `apps` registry**: You can access any model using the `apps.get_model()` method, which takes two arguments: the app label and the model name.\n\n2. **Execute Django setup**: If you are running this outside of a standard Django environment, make sure to set up Django properly before accessing the models.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport django\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.apps import apps\n\n# Ensure Django is set up properly if this script is run standalone\nif not settings.configured:\n    settings.configure(\n        INSTALLED_APPS=[\n            'django.contrib.auth',\n            # Add other necessary apps here\n        ],\n        # Add other required settings here\n    )\n    django.setup()\n\ndef get_model_class(app_label, model_name):\n    try:\n        model = apps.get_model(app_label, model_name)\n        return model\n    except LookupError:\n        print(f\"Model '{model_name}' not found in app '{app_label}'\")\n        return None\n\n# Assuming you want the 'User' model from the 'auth' app\nmodel_name = 'User'\napp_label = 'auth'\n\nmodel_class = get_model_class(app_label, model_name)\n\nif model_class:\n    # Now you can use the model class\n    users = model_class.objects.all()\n    for user in users:\n        print(user)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`apps.get_model(app_label, model_name)`**: This function retrieves the model class based on the app label and model name you provide.\n- **Django setup**: Make sure Django is set up with necessary settings and installed apps if you run this script standalone.\n- **Error handling**: The code includes basic error handling to inform you if the model can't be found in the specified app.\n\nThis approach avoids the need to know the full module path and allows you to dynamically access models based on user input or other dynamic factors."
