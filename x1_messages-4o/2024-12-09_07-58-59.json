I have legacy libraries such as libgmp in /usr/lib and have compiled libgmp 5.x in my $HOME/app. However, when I try to install pycrypto, which is a dependency of fabric, using the command `CFLGAS=-I/home/qrtt1/app/include LDFLGAS=-L/home/qrtt1/app/lib  pip install pycrypto`, none of my include or lib directories are in the compilation/linking options. I've also tried downloading pycrypto-2.5 and installing it using `CFLGAS=-I/home/qrtt1/app/include LDFLGAS=-L/home/qrtt1/app/lib python setup.py install`, but no CFLAGS or LDFLAGS are set up with it. How can I correctly assign the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS for building pycrypto?"

        "content": "To correctly assign the `CFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` when building `pycrypto`, you need to ensure that the environment variables are set correctly before running the installation command. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Set the environment variables**: \n\n   You can export the `CFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` environment variables in your shell session before running the `pip install` or `python setup.py install` command. This way, the compiler will use the specified include and library directories during the build process.\n\n   ```bash\n   export CFLAGS=\"-I/home/qrtt1/app/include\"\n   export LDFLAGS=\"-L/home/qrtt1/app/lib\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Install pycrypto**:\n\n   After setting the environment variables, you can proceed with the installation. You can use either `pip` or `setup.py`:\n\n   - Using `pip`:\n     ```bash\n     pip install pycrypto\n     ```\n\n   - Using `setup.py`:\n     If you have downloaded the `pycrypto-2.5` source code, navigate to the directory where `setup.py` is located and run:\n     ```bash\n     python setup.py install\n     ```\n\n3. **Verify the build process**:\n\n   While the installation is in progress, check the output to ensure that your specified include and library paths are being picked up. You should see the paths `/home/qrtt1/app/include` and `/home/qrtt1/app/lib` in the compilation and linking steps.\n\nBy setting the environment variables before running the installation command, you ensure that they are available to the build process, allowing it to correctly find your custom library paths. If you still encounter issues, it might be helpful to check the setup logs for any errors or warnings that could provide more insight into what's going wrong."
