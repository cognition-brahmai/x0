The `-d` flag is used to test if a given path is a directory. Here's a simple example of how you can do this:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nDIRECTORY=\"/path/to/directory\"\n\nif [ -d \"$DIRECTORY\" ]; then\n  echo \"Directory exists.\"\nelse\n  echo \"Directory does not exist.\"\nfi\n```\n\nReplace `\"/path/to/directory\"` with the path of the directory you want to check. This script will print \"Directory exists.\" if the directory is present, or \"Directory does not exist.\" if it is not. \n\nThis method is efficient and commonly used in shell scripting for directory existence checks."
