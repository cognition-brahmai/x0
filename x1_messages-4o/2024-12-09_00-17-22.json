This pipeline includes a `PythonScriptStep` where I download a model from tensorflow-hub, retrain it, save it as a `.zip`, and finally, I want to register it in Azure ML. However, since I don't have a workspace within the script, I can't use `Model.register()`. I have tried using `Run.register_model()` instead, but I am encountering an error which states that it could not locate the provided model_path `retrained.zip` in the set of files uploaded to the run, even though the `retrained.zip` file is present in the `./outputs` directory. What am I doing wrong?"

        "content": "To register a model from within the `PythonScriptStep` of an Azure ML Pipeline, you need to ensure that the model file is properly uploaded to the run's output directory so that it can be registered. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you address this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure the Model is Saved Correctly:**\n   Make sure your script saves the model to the `outputs` directory, which is the default directory for files you want to persist and access after the run is complete. For example:\n   ```python\n   import os\n\n   # Define the outputs directory\n   output_dir = './outputs'\n   os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)\n\n   # Save your retrained model as a .zip file in the outputs directory\n   model_path = os.path.join(output_dir, 'retrained.zip')\n   # Assuming 'model' is your trained model object\n   model.save(model_path)\n   ```\n\n2. **Register the Model Using `Run` Object:**\n   Within your script, you can leverage the `Run` context to register the model. Here's how you can do it:\n\n   ```python\n   from azureml.core import Run\n\n   # Get the current run context\n   run = Run.get_context()\n\n   # Register the model\n   run.register_model(model_name='my_retrained_model', model_path='outputs/retrained.zip')\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify File Upload:**\n   Double-check that the file is indeed uploaded to the run's output. You can do this by checking the logs or listing files in the `outputs` directory after the script execution.\n\n4. **Check File Paths:**\n   Ensure that the paths used in your script are correct and consistent. It's common to encounter path-related issues, especially if running locally and then in the cloud. Always use relative paths with respect to the working directory.\n\n5. **Debugging Tips:**\n   - Use logging or print statements to confirm that the file is being saved at the expected location.\n   - After the run, navigate to the Azure ML Studio, go to the specific run, and check the \"Outputs + logs\" tab to verify the presence of your `retrained.zip` file.\n\n6. **Workspace Context:**\n   If you need to use the workspace object (e.g., for more advanced operations beyond model registration), you can always pass the workspace configuration file or environment variables to your script. However, for `Run.register_model()`, the above steps should suffice.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully register your model within the Azure ML Pipeline using a `PythonScriptStep`."
