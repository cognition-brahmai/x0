        "content": "In a certain laboratory, scientists were conducting experiments on a virus that had been isolated from an unknown source. They observed that this virus had a unique property of mutating at a very rapid rate. After thorough analysis, they found that this virus had a specific gene mutation that allowed it to evade the human immune system.\nUpon further investigation, they discovered that this specific gene mutation was not unique to this virus but was present in other viruses as well. They also found that this mutation had the potential to contribute to the development of pandemic-level diseases.\nUsing the information provided in the table below, can you identify the virus(es) that have this gene mutation and could potentially cause a pandemic? \nTable: \n| Virus Name | Gene Mutation |\n|------------|---------------|\n| Virus A    | A3G4T2        |\n| Virus B    | A3C4G2        |\n| Virus C    | A4C3T2        |\n| Virus D    | A4T3C2        |\n| Virus E    | A2T4G3        |\n| Virus F    | A2G4C3        |\n| Virus G    | A2C4T3        |\n| Virus H    | A3T4C2        |\nHint: The gene mutation of the potential pandemic-causing virus(es) contains the nucleotide sequence \"A3\" and \"T2\" in any order."

Therefore, Virus A has the gene mutation that could potentially contribute to the development of pandemic-level diseases."
