I tried adding the following code to settings.py, right after the CACHES section:\n\n```python\nfrom django.core.cache import cache\ncache.clear()\n```\n\nBut, I encountered an error saying that it can't find the file 'settings.py' in the directory containing 'manage.py'. The full error message is as follows:\n\n```python\nError: Can't find the file 'settings.py' in the directory containing 'manage.py'. It appears you've customized things.\nYou'll have to run django-admin.py, passing it your settings module.\n(If the file settings.py does indeed exist, it's causing an ImportError somehow.)\nmake: *** [server] Error 1\n```\n\nAre there any other ways to accomplish this? Any suggestions would be appreciated."

        "content": "To ensure that your cache is cleared every time you restart or reload your Django server, you can utilize Django's signals or middleware. Here are a couple of alternative approaches you can consider:\n\n### Using Django's Signals\n\nYou can use Django's `post_migrate` signal to clear the cache after migrations, which can effectively be used to clear the cache when the server starts:\n\n1. **Create a new file (e.g., `signals.py`) in one of your Django apps.**\n\n2. **Add the following code to `signals.py`:**\n\n    ```python\n    from django.core.cache import cache\n    from django.db.models.signals import post_migrate\n    from django.dispatch import receiver\n\n    @receiver(post_migrate)\n    def clear_cache(sender, **kwargs):\n        cache.clear()\n    ```\n\n3. **Import the signals module in your app's `apps.py`:**\n\n    ```python\n    from django.apps import AppConfig\n\n    class YourAppConfig(AppConfig):\n        name = 'your_app_name'\n\n        def ready(self):\n            import your_app_name.signals\n    ```\n\n4. **Ensure you have set your app's configuration in `INSTALLED_APPS` within `settings.py`:**\n\n    ```python\n    INSTALLED_APPS = [\n        # ... other installed apps\n        'your_app_name.apps.YourAppConfig',\n    ]\n    ```\n\n### Using Middleware\n\nAnother approach is to create a custom middleware that clears the cache on the first request after the server starts:\n\n1. **Create a new middleware file (e.g., `middleware.py`) in one of your Django apps.**\n\n2. **Add the following code to `middleware.py`:**\n\n    ```python\n    from django.core.cache import cache\n\n    class ClearCacheMiddleware:\n        def __init__(self, get_response):\n            self.get_response = get_response\n            self.cache_cleared = False\n\n        def __call__(self, request):\n            if not self.cache_cleared:\n                cache.clear()\n                self.cache_cleared = True\n\n            response = self.get_response(request)\n            return response\n    ```\n\n3. **Add your middleware to the `MIDDLEWARE` list in `settings.py`:**\n\n    ```python\n    MIDDLEWARE = [\n        # ... other middleware\n        'your_app_name.middleware.ClearCacheMiddleware',\n    ]\n    ```\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Development vs. Production:** Ensure that the cache-clearing mechanism is appropriate for your environment. You might want to limit cache clearing to development environments only, depending on your use case.\n\n- **Cache Backend:** Make sure your `CACHES` setting in `settings.py` is correctly configured for your desired cache backend (e.g., `memcached`, `redis`, etc.).\n\nBy using either of these methods, you can automate cache clearing during server restarts/reloads without encountering issues with `settings.py`."
