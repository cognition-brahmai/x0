        "content": "Certainly! Calculating the factorial of a number can be done using either a recursive approach or an iterative approach. Below are examples of both methods:\n\n### Recursive Approach\nThe recursive approach involves a function that calls itself to compute the factorial. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\ndef factorial_recursive(n):\n    # Base case: if n is 0 or 1, return 1\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        # Recursive case: n * factorial of (n-1)\n        return n * factorial_recursive(n - 1)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumber = 5\nresult = factorial_recursive(number)\nprint(f\"The factorial of {number} is {result}.\")\n```\n\n### Iterative Approach\nThe iterative approach uses a loop to calculate the factorial. Here's the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef factorial_iterative(n):\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        result *= i\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nnumber = 5\nresult = factorial_iterative(number)\nprint(f\"The factorial of {number} is {result}.\")\n```\n\nBoth methods will give you the same result. You can choose either based on your preference or the specific requirements of your problem."
