I have a class that iterates over a list of data and I would like to know if there's a way to step backwards in the `str()` method by one step. Here's the code I am currently using:\n\n```python\nclass IterTest(object):\n    def __init__(self, data):\n        self.data = data\n        self.__iter = None\n\n    def all(self):\n        self.__iter = iter(self.data)\n        for each in self.__iter:\n            mtd = getattr(self, type(each).__name__)\n            mtd(each)\n\n    def str(self, item):\n        print item\n\n        next = self.__iter.next()\n        while isinstance(next, int):\n            print next\n            next = self.__iter.next()\n\n    def int(self, item):\n        print \"Crap i skipped C\"\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    test = IterTest(['a', 1, 2,3,'c', 17])\n    test.all()\n```\nWhen I run this code, I get the following output:\n\n```shell\na\n1\n2\n3\nCrap i skipped C\n```\n\nI understand why I get this output, but I would like to know if there's a way to step backwards in the `str()` method by one step. I don't want to do a full reverse, but rather I'm looking for the equivalent of a bidirectional iterator in Python."

        "content": "In Python, standard iterators are not bidirectional, meaning you can't move backwards through an iterator once you've moved forward. However, you can implement a custom iterator that allows you to move both forward and backward. One way to achieve this is by maintaining an index for the current position in the list and adjusting it as needed.\n\nHere's a modified version of your class that allows stepping backwards:\n\n```python\nclass IterTest(object):\n    def __init__(self, data):\n        self.data = data\n        self.index = -1\n\n    def all(self):\n        self.index = -1\n        while self.index < len(self.data) - 1:\n            self.index += 1\n            item = self.data[self.index]\n            mtd = getattr(self, type(item).__name__)\n            mtd(item)\n\n    def str(self, item):\n        print(item)\n        self.step_forward_until_non_int()\n\n    def int(self, item):\n        print(\"Crap i skipped C\")\n\n    def step_forward_until_non_int(self):\n        while self.index < len(self.data) - 1:\n            self.index += 1\n            next_item = self.data[self.index]\n            if not isinstance(next_item, int):\n                # Step back once to handle non-int items later\n                self.index -= 1\n                break\n            print(next_item)\n\n    def step_backward(self):\n        if self.index > 0:\n            self.index -= 1\n            return self.data[self.index]\n        return None\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    test = IterTest(['a', 1, 2, 3, 'c', 17])\n    test.all()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Index Tracking**: We use an `index` attribute to keep track of the current position in the data list.\n\n2. **Step Forward**: The `step_forward_until_non_int` method moves the index forward until a non-integer is found. It then steps back one index to allow handling non-integer items later.\n\n3. **Step Backward**: The `step_backward` method reduces the index by one, effectively moving backwards. You could call this method when you need to step back.\n\n4. **Flow Control**: The `all` method controls the iteration and calls the appropriate methods based on the type of the current item.\n\nThis setup allows you to manage the position within your list and step backward or forward as needed."
