        "content": "When you use `GridSearchCV` from Scikit-learn to perform hyperparameter tuning, the `cv_results_` attribute is a comprehensive dictionary that provides detailed information about each parameter combination tested during the grid search. This attribute is valuable for analyzing the performance of different hyperparameter settings. Here's a breakdown of the key components you might find in `cv_results_`:\n\n1. **`mean_fit_time`**: The average time (in seconds) it took to fit the model on the training data for each fold and each parameter combination.\n\n2. **`std_fit_time`**: The standard deviation of the fit time, providing a measure of variability in fitting time across different folds.\n\n3. **`mean_score_time`**: The average time (in seconds) it took to score the model on the validation data for each fold and parameter combination.\n\n4. **`std_score_time`**: The standard deviation of the score time across the different folds.\n\n5. **`param_<param_name>`**: The specific hyperparameter value for each parameter name in the grid. For example, `param_max_depth` will show the depth levels tested.\n\n6. **`params`**: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary corresponds to a parameter setting that was tested.\n\n7. **`mean_test_score`**: The average score obtained on the validation set for each parameter setting, computed over all cross-validation folds. This is the main metric used to evaluate the performance of the parameter set, and it helps you identify which settings perform best.\n\n8. **`std_test_score`**: The standard deviation of the test scores, indicating how much the performance varied across different cross-validation folds.\n\n9. **`rank_test_score`**: The rank of each parameter setting based on the mean test score. The best score is ranked 1.\n\n10. **`split0_test_score`, `split1_test_score`, ..., `splitN_test_score`**: The test scores obtained for each individual cross-validation split. This provides insight into how the model performed on each fold of the data.\n\nIn your specific use case, you're using `GridSearchCV` to optimize the hyperparameters `max_depth` and `min_samples_split` for a `DecisionTreeClassifier`. The `mean_test_score` in `cv_results_` will tell you the average ROC AUC score achieved with the different combinations of these parameters across the folds. By analyzing these results, you can identify which combination of hyperparameters provides the best performance for your model."
