        "content": "I have a Python class named 'ObjectOne' and within this class, I have two methods: 'print_class_name' and 'print_class_name_again'. The method 'print_class_name' is a class method and is supposed to print the name of the class, while the method 'print_class_name_again' is an instance method and also prints the name of the class. However, when running this code, the output is 'type' and 'ObjectOne' respectively, instead of 'ObjectOne' for both as I would like it to be. How can I modify my code to get the desired output while keeping 'print_class_name' as a class method? Here's my code: \n\n```python\nclass ObjectOne(object):\n    @classmethod\n    def print_class_name(cls):\n        print cls.__class__.__name__\n\n    def print_class_name_again(self):\n        print self.__class__.__name__\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    obj_one = ObjectOne()\n    obj_one.print_class_name()\n    obj_one.print_class_name_again()\n```\n\nAnd here's my current output: \n\n```python\ntype\nObjectOne\n```\n\nI would like the output to be:\n\n```python\nObjectOne\nObjectOne\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the way you're accessing the class name in the `print_class_name` method. When using `cls.__class__.__name__`, it actually refers to the name of the metaclass of `cls`, which is `type`. Instead, you should directly access the `__name__` attribute of `cls` itself to get the class name.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired output:\n\n```python\nclass ObjectOne(object):\n    @classmethod\n    def print_class_name(cls):\n        print(cls.__name__)\n\n    def print_class_name_again(self):\n        print(self.__class__.__name__)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    obj_one = ObjectOne()\n    obj_one.print_class_name()\n    obj_one.print_class_name_again()\n```\n\nWith this modification, both `print_class_name()` and `print_class_name_again()` will print \"ObjectOne\", as you intended."
