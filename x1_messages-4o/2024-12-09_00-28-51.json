I need a solution that can auto-size columns. I don't require any complex formatting for the data items, as they are simply strings. Are there any existing libraries or methods that can accomplish this or would I need to write my own?"

        "content": "To pretty-print tables in ASCII format with borders and auto-sized columns, you can use the `tabulate` library in Python. `tabulate` is a powerful library that provides flexible table formatting, including the ability to add borders and adjust column widths automatically.\n\nHere's how you can use `tabulate` to achieve the desired table format:\n\n1. First, install the library if you haven't already:\n\n   ```\n   pip install tabulate\n   ```\n\n2. Use the library to format your data:\n\n```python\nfrom tabulate import tabulate\n\n# Define the headers and data\nheaders = [\"column 1\", \"column 2\"]\ndata = [\n    [\"value1\", \"value2\"],\n    [\"value3\", \"value4\"]\n]\n\n# Use tabulate to create a table with grid format\ntable = tabulate(data, headers, tablefmt=\"grid\")\n\n# Print the formatted table\nprint(table)\n```\n\nThis will produce the following output:\n\n```\n+-----------+-----------+\n| column 1  | column 2  |\n+===========+===========+\n| value1    | value2    |\n+-----------+-----------+\n| value3    | value4    |\n+-----------+-----------+\n```\n\nThe `tablefmt=\"grid\"` option specifies the table format with borders. You can explore other formatting styles provided by `tabulate` by checking its documentation. This method will automatically adjust the column widths based on the content, giving you a clean and readable ASCII table."
