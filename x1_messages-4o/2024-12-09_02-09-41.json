Here are my current VSCode settings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"python.pythonPath\": \"~/.envs/myProject/bin/python\",\n  \"python.linting.pep8Enabled\": true,\n  \"python.linting.pylintPath\": \"~/.envs/myProject/bin/pylint\",\n  \"python.linting.pylintArgs\": [\"--load-plugins\", \"pylint_django\", \"--max-line-length=100\"],\n  \"python.formatting.autopep8Args\": [\"--max-line-length=100\"],\n  \"python.linting.pylintEnabled\": true,\n  \"files.exclude\": {\n    \"**/.git\": true,\n    \"**/.svn\": true,\n    \"**/.hg\": true,\n    \"**/CVS\": true,\n    \"**/.DS_Store\": true,\n    \".vscode\": true,\n    \"**/*.pyc\": true\n  }\n}\n```"

        "content": "To prevent PyLint from complaining about line lengths exceeding 79 characters, you need to ensure that the `--max-line-length` argument is correctly set in your PyLint configuration. You've already included this in your `python.linting.pylintArgs` setting. However, sometimes PyLint might not pick this up due to a missing configuration file or other configuration conflicts.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure PyLint is Picking Up the Correct Configuration:**\n   - Double-check your `python.linting.pylintArgs` setting. It seems you have it correctly set, but ensure there are no typos or syntax issues.\n\n2. **Create/Edit a `.pylintrc` File:**\n   - If you don't already have one, create a `.pylintrc` file in your project's root directory.\n   - Add or modify the following lines in the `[FORMAT]` section to set the maximum line length:\n     ```ini\n     [FORMAT]\n     max-line-length=100\n     ```\n\n3. **Check for Other Configuration Files:**\n   - Ensure there are no other PyLint configuration files in your project that might override your settings (`.pylintrc`, `pylintrc`, `setup.cfg`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.).\n\n4. **Restart VSCode:**\n   - Sometimes, changes won't take effect until you restart VSCode. Make sure you've saved all your settings and then restart the IDE.\n\n5. **Verify PyLint Path:**\n   - Check that the PyLint path specified in your settings is correct and matches the environment you're working in:\n     ```json\n     \"python.linting.pylintPath\": \"~/.envs/myProject/bin/pylint\",\n     ```\n\n6. **Check the Integrated Terminal:**\n   - Run PyLint manually in your terminal to see if it respects the line length setting:\n     ```bash\n     ~/.envs/myProject/bin/pylint --max-line-length=100 <your_python_file.py>\n     ```\n   - This helps diagnose whether the issue is with VSCode or PyLint itself.\n\nIf you've followed all these steps and it's still not working, it could be an issue with how VSCode is interpreting the settings. In such a case, consider updating both VSCode and its Python extension to the latest versions, as bugs and issues are frequently resolved in updates."
