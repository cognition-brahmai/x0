I am trying to plot a confusion matrix for my image classifier with the following code, but I am encountering an error that says 'PrefetchDataset' object has no attribute 'classes'.

        "content": "The error you're encountering stems from the fact that a `tf.data.Dataset` object, such as the one you get from `PrefetchDataset`, doesn't have a `classes` attribute. This attribute is typically found in Keras' `ImageDataGenerator` or similar objects, but not in `tf.data.Dataset`. To extract the true labels (classes) from a prefetched dataset, you can iterate over the dataset and collect the labels manually.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n1. Extract the true labels from your dataset.\n2. Use these labels to compute the confusion matrix.\n\nHere's an example of how you might do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming your dataset is structured as (features, labels)\ntrue_labels = []\n\n# Iterate over the validation dataset to extract true labels\nfor _, labels in validation_dataset:\n    true_labels.extend(labels.numpy())\n\n# Convert list to numpy array\ntrue_labels = np.array(true_labels)\n\n# Get predictions from the model\nY_pred = model.predict(validation_dataset)\ny_pred = np.argmax(Y_pred, axis=1)\n\n# Print confusion matrix\nprint('Confusion Matrix')\nprint(confusion_matrix(true_labels, y_pred))\n```\n\n### Key Steps:\n\n1. **Iterating over the Dataset**: We loop through the `validation_dataset`, which yields batches of images and their corresponding labels. We collect these labels into a list.\n\n2. **Convert to NumPy Array**: The list of true labels is then converted into a NumPy array for compatibility with Scikit-learn's `confusion_matrix` function.\n\n3. **Model Predictions**: Use the model to predict the labels for your validation dataset.\n\n4. **Confusion Matrix**: Finally, use Scikit-learn's `confusion_matrix` function to compute and print the confusion matrix.\n\nThis approach should solve the issue and allow you to compute the confusion matrix for your image classifier."
