For example, given inputs such as \"Westminister15\", \"Westminister15London\", or \"23Westminister15London\", I want to obtain outputs like [\"Westminister\", \"15\"], [\"Westminister\", \"15\", \"London\"], and [\"23\", \"Westminister\", \"15\", \"London\"] respectively. Currently, my function uses regular expressions to separate digits and alphabets, but it does not work well when there are multiple words separated by spaces, as in \"Westminister15London England\". Is there a better approach to achieve this?"

        "content": "Certainly! To efficiently split a string into separate alpha and numeric components, you can use a combination of regular expressions and Python's `re` module. The key is to match sequences of digits and alphabetic characters separately, and handle spaces or word boundaries effectively.\n\nHere's a Python function that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef split_alpha_numeric(input_string):\n    # Regular expression to match sequences of digits and alphabetic characters\n    pattern = r'(\\d+|[A-Za-z]+)'\n    # Find all matches of the pattern in the input string\n    result = re.findall(pattern, input_string)\n    return result\n\n# Examples\nprint(split_alpha_numeric(\"Westminister15\")) # Output: ['Westminister', '15']\nprint(split_alpha_numeric(\"Westminister15London\")) # Output: ['Westminister', '15', 'London']\nprint(split_alpha_numeric(\"23Westminister15London\")) # Output: ['23', 'Westminister', '15', 'London']\nprint(split_alpha_numeric(\"Westminister15London England\")) # Output: ['Westminister', '15', 'London', 'England']\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The regular expression `r'(\\d+|[A-Za-z]+)'` is designed to capture groups of digits (`\\d+`) or contiguous alphabetic characters (`[A-Za-z]+`).\n- `re.findall()` is used to extract all occurrences that match the pattern, which returns a list of matched substrings.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles mixed strings of numbers and letters, whether or not they are separated by spaces. If you want to capture sequences that include spaces between words, you could consider extending the pattern to handle whitespace if needed. However, for the typical use case described, the above function should work effectively."
