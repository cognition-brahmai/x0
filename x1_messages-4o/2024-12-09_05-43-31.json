But when I see others import 'tkinter' with a lower-case 't' and try to run their code, I receive an error: \n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"C:\\Python27\\pygame2.py\", line 1, in <module>\n    from tkinter import *\nImportError: No module named tkinter\n```"

        "content": "The difference between using 'tkinter' and 'Tkinter' in Python is related to the version of Python you are using. \n\n1. **Python 2**: In Python 2.x, the module is named with a capital 'T' as `Tkinter`. This means you should import it using:\n   ```python\n   import Tkinter as tk\n   ```\n\n2. **Python 3**: In Python 3.x, the module was renamed to use a lowercase 't' as `tkinter`. So, you should import it using:\n   ```python\n   import tkinter as tk\n   ```\n\nThe error you encountered indicates that you are trying to run Python 3 code (which uses `tkinter`) in a Python 2 environment, where the module is actually named `Tkinter`. To resolve this, you have two options:\n\n- **Option 1**: If you are working in a Python 2 environment, ensure you use the correct import statement for Python 2:\n  ```python\n  import Tkinter as tk\n  ```\n\n- **Option 2**: If you have access to Python 3, run your code in a Python 3 environment where the import statement with lowercase 't' is valid:\n  ```python\n  import tkinter as tk\n  ```\n\nTo switch between Python versions, ensure you have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed, and use the appropriate command or environment to run your scripts (e.g., `python` for Python 2 and `python3` for Python 3, depending on your system configuration)."
