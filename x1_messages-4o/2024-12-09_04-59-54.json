In my derived class, I want to call the property getter or setter of the base class. However, calling the attribute itself results in infinite recursion. How can I call a property of the base class if this property is being overwritten in the derived class? \n\nHere's an illustration of my problem:\n\n```python\nclass Foo(object):\n\n    @property\n    def bar(self):\n        return 5\n\n    @bar.setter\n    def bar(self, a):\n        print a\n\nclass FooBar(Foo):\n\n    @property\n    def bar(self):\n        # return the same value\n        # as in the base class\n        return self.bar # --> recursion!\n\n    @bar.setter\n    def bar(self, c):\n        # perform the same action\n        # as in the base class\n        self.bar = c    # --> recursion!\n        # then do something else\n        print 'something else'\n\nfb = FooBar()\nfb.bar = 7\n```"

        "content": "To solve the problem of infinite recursion when overriding properties in a derived class, you can directly call the base class's property methods using `super()`. The `super()` function allows you to call methods from the base class without directly referencing the class name, which is particularly useful in complex inheritance hierarchies.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to call the base class's property methods correctly:\n\n```python\nclass Foo(object):\n\n    @property\n    def bar(self):\n        return 5\n\n    @bar.setter\n    def bar(self, a):\n        print(a)\n\nclass FooBar(Foo):\n\n    @property\n    def bar(self):\n        # Call the base class's `bar` property getter\n        return super(FooBar, self).bar\n\n    @bar.setter\n    def bar(self, c):\n        # Call the base class's `bar` property setter\n        super(FooBar, self.__class__).bar.fset(self, c)\n        # Then do something else\n        print('something else')\n\nfb = FooBar()\nfb.bar = 7\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Getter**: In the `FooBar` class, when getting the `bar` property, we use `super(FooBar, self).bar` to access the `bar` property from the `Foo` class, avoiding recursion.\n- **Setter**: In the `FooBar` class, when setting the `bar` property, we use `super(FooBar, self.__class__).bar.fset(self, c)` to call the setter of the `bar` property from the `Foo` class. The `fset` method is used to explicitly call the setter function of the property.\n\nThis approach ensures that you can extend or modify the behavior of properties in derived classes while still utilizing the functionality provided by the base class."
