However, if you are looking for a simple way to display this information using a shell command, you can use the `echo` command to directly print the author's name, as it's not something that can be dynamically fetched without a data source to query. Here's how you could do it:\n\n```bash\necho \"Lewis Carroll\"\n```\n\nLewis Carroll is the pen name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, who authored \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.\""
