        "content": "The blue color of the sky is primarily due to a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering. This occurs when sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere and interacts with the gases and particles present in the air. Sunlight, or white light, is composed of different colors, each with different wavelengths. Blue light has a shorter wavelength and higher energy compared to other colors like red.\n\nAs sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) are scattered in all directions by the tiny molecules of air and other particles. Although violet light is scattered even more than blue, our eyes are more sensitive to blue light, and the upper atmosphere absorbs some violet light, making the sky appear predominantly blue to us.\n\nDuring sunrise and sunset, the sun is lower in the sky, and its light passes through a greater thickness of the Earth's atmosphere. This increased distance scatters away even more of the shorter wavelengths, allowing the longer wavelengths like red and orange to reach our eyes, which is why the sky can appear red or orange at these times."
