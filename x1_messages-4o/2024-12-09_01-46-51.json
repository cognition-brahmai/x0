        "content": "To use the Python `re` module to find the start and end positions of all matches for a given pattern in a string, you can use the `re.finditer()` method. This method returns an iterator yielding match objects, which you can then use to get the start and end positions, as well as the text of each match.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this for your example with the pattern `r'[a-z]'` and the string `'a1b2c3d4'`:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Define the pattern and the string\npattern = r'[a-z]'\nstring = 'a1b2c3d4'\n\n# Use re.finditer() to find all matches\nmatches = re.finditer(pattern, string)\n\n# Iterate through the matches and print the start, end positions, and matched text\nfor match in matches:\n    start_pos = match.start()\n    end_pos = match.end()\n    matched_text = match.group()\n    print(f\"Match '{matched_text}' found at: Start = {start_pos}, End = {end_pos}\")\n```\n\nThis script will output:\n\n```\nMatch 'a' found at: Start = 0, End = 1\nMatch 'b' found at: Start = 2, End = 3\nMatch 'c' found at: Start = 4, End = 5\nMatch 'd' found at: Start = 6, End = 7\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `re.finditer(pattern, string)` creates an iterator over all matches of the pattern in the string.\n- For each match, `match.start()` gives the start position, `match.end()` gives the end position, and `match.group()` gives the matched text."
