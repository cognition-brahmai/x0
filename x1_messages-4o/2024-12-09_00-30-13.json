I've noticed that the csv library in Python always generates DOS end-of-line characters, even when I use the 'wb' mode and even when the environment is Linux. For instance, consider the following code:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\nf = open('output.txt', 'wb');\nwriter = csv.writer(f)\nwriter.writerow([2,3,4]);\nf.close()\n```\n\nThe above code always uses '\\r\\n' as the end of line separator. Is there a way to make it use '\\n' only?"

        "content": "When using Python's `csv` module, it defaults to using DOS-style end-of-line characters (`\\r\\n`) for compatibility reasons. This is true regardless of the platform. However, you can change this behavior by specifying the newline parameter when opening the file. \n\nHere\u2019s how you can modify your code to use only `\\n` as the line terminator:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\n# Open the file in binary write mode and specify newline=''\nwith open('output.txt', 'w', newline='') as f:\n    writer = csv.writer(f, lineterminator='\\n')\n    writer.writerow([2, 3, 4])\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **`newline=''`**: This tells Python not to translate newline characters, allowing the `csv` module to handle them. This is necessary to prevent any default newline translation by the underlying platform.\n  \n- **`lineterminator='\\n'`**: This parameter in the `csv.writer` allows you to specify the line terminator explicitly. By default, it's set to `\\r\\n`, but you can change it to `\\n` as needed.\n\nBy using these parameters, you ensure that the CSV writer uses `\\n` as the end-of-line character."
