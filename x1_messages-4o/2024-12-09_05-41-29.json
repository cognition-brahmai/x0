I currently have a system where I store the task_id from a celery.result.AsyncResult in a database and relate it to the item that the task affects. This allows me to perform a query to retrieve all the task_ids of tasks that relate to a specific item. My question is, after retrieving the task_id from the database, how do I go about retrieving information about the task's state, result and so on?"

        "content": "To retrieve information about a task's state, result, and other details using a task ID in Celery, you can use the `AsyncResult` class. The `AsyncResult` object provides various methods and properties that allow you to check the status of a task and retrieve its result.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Import the necessary classes**: Ensure you have Celery installed and import `AsyncResult`.\n\n2. **Create an AsyncResult instance**: Use the task ID you retrieved from the database to create an `AsyncResult` instance.\n\n3. **Check the status and retrieve results**: Use the methods and properties of the `AsyncResult` instance to get the desired information.\n\nHere's a basic example of how to implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom celery.result import AsyncResult\nfrom your_celery_app import app  # Import your Celery app instance\n\ndef get_task_info(task_id):\n    # Create an AsyncResult instance\n    result = AsyncResult(task_id, app=app)\n\n    # Get the state of the task\n    task_state = result.state\n\n    # Check if the task is ready and get the result\n    if result.ready():\n        task_result = result.result\n    else:\n        task_result = None\n\n    # Check if the task was successful\n    is_successful = result.successful()\n\n    # Check if the task failed\n    if result.failed():\n        task_failure_info = result.traceback  # Get the traceback if available\n    else:\n        task_failure_info = None\n\n    return {\n        'state': task_state,\n        'result': task_result,\n        'successful': is_successful,\n        'failure_info': task_failure_info,\n    }\n\n# Example usage\ntask_id = 'your-task-id-from-database'\ntask_info = get_task_info(task_id)\nprint(task_info)\n```\n\n### Key Properties and Methods:\n\n- `state`: Returns the current state of the task (e.g., `PENDING`, `STARTED`, `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`).\n\n- `result`: Returns the result of the task if it has completed successfully. If the task failed, it returns the exception raised by the task.\n\n- `ready()`: Returns `True` if the task is finished (either successfully or with failure).\n\n- `successful()`: Returns `True` if the task finished successfully.\n\n- `failed()`: Returns `True` if the task failed.\n\n- `traceback`: Returns the traceback if the task raised an exception (available only if the task has failed).\n\nMake sure that your Celery app is properly configured to store task results, either in a backend like Redis, RabbitMQ, or a database, so that `AsyncResult` can retrieve the information."
