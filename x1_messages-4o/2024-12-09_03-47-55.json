Here's the piece of code I'm trying:\n\n```python\nX = \"hello world\"\nX.replace(\"hello\", \"goodbye\")\n```\n\nI want to change the word \"hello\" to \"goodbye\", so the string \"hello world\" should be transformed into \"goodbye world\". However, the value of X remains as \"hello world\". Can you explain why this is happening and how I can correct it?"

        "content": "In Python, strings are immutable, which means that any operations that transform a string will actually return a new string rather than modifying the original one. In your code, the `replace` method returns a new string with the specified replacements, but it doesn't change the original string `X` unless you explicitly assign the result back to it.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired result:\n\n```python\nX = \"hello world\"\nX = X.replace(\"hello\", \"goodbye\")\n```\n\nBy assigning the result of `X.replace(\"hello\", \"goodbye\")` back to `X`, you update `X` to hold the new string \"goodbye world\"."
