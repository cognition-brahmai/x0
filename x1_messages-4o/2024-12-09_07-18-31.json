For example, I have the following code:\n\n```python\nsome_list = range(a, b+1)\n```\n\nWhen I checked my coding style using the PEP8 plugin for vim, I received a warning that there's missing whitespace around the operator. But after reading the PEP 8 style guide multiple times, I couldn't find the rule corresponding to this warning. Is it correct to write the code like this to be compliant with PEP 8?\n\n```python\nsome_list = range(a, b + 1)\n```"

        "content": "Yes, according to PEP 8, the Python style guide, it is recommended to include whitespace around operators for better readability. This includes arithmetic operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. The style guide suggests using spaces around these operators to improve the clarity of the code.\n\nSo, while your original code:\n\n```python\nsome_list = range(a, b+1)\n```\n\nis functionally correct, the PEP 8 style guide would prefer you to write it as:\n\n```python\nsome_list = range(a, b + 1)\n```\n\nThis spacing helps make the code more readable and consistent with the style guide's recommendations. The warning you received from the PEP8 plugin for vim is indicating that your code could be improved for readability by adding whitespace around the `+` operator."

]ur condition as a function\ndef condition(val):\n    return val > 2\n\n# Use a list comprehension with enumerate to find indices\nindices = [i for i, val in enumerate(a) if condition(val)]\nprint(indices)\n# Output: [2, 5, 8]\n```\n\nTo get the values at those indices:\n\n```python\n# Use the indices to extract the values\nvalues = [a[i] for i in indices]\nprint(values)\n# Output: [3, 3, 3]\n```\n\nBy defining the condition as a separate function, you can easily change the condition to whatever you need, making it quite flexible and readable. For example, if you wanted to find indices where the values are even, you could modify the `condition` function like this:\n\n```python\ndef condition(val):\n    return val % 2 == 0\n```\n\nThis approach keeps your code concise and easy to read, while still providing the flexibility to use any condition you like."
