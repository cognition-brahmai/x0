        "content": "Certainly! To highlight all instances of the word \"ubiquitous\" in a given text on a webpage, you can use a combination of JavaScript and HTML. Here's a step-by-step guide along with the code to achieve this:\n\n1. **Wrap the text in a container element**: First, you need to have your text inside an HTML element, like a `<div>` or `<p>`. This will allow you to manipulate its content.\n\n2. **JavaScript function**: Create a JavaScript function that will search for the word \"ubiquitous\" and wrap each instance in a `<span>` tag with a specific background color.\n\n3. **Execute the function**: Call the function to apply the highlighting.\n\nHere's how you can implement it:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Highlight Text</title>\n    <style>\n        .highlight {\n            background-color: yellow;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div id=\"content\">\n        The internet is ubiquitous in modern society. Its reach is ubiquitous, from cities to rural areas. The concept of the internet of things aims to make technology even more ubiquitous.\n    </div>\n\n    <script>\n        function highlightWord(text, word) {\n            // Create a regular expression to find all instances of the word\n            const regex = new RegExp(`\\\\b${word}\\\\b`, 'gi');\n            \n            // Replace each instance with a span element for highlighting\n            const highlightedText = text.replace(regex, `<span class=\"highlight\">${word}</span>`);\n            \n            return highlightedText;\n        }\n\n        // Get the content element\n        const contentElement = document.getElementById('content');\n        \n        // Get the original text\n        const originalText = contentElement.innerHTML;\n        \n        // Highlight the word \"ubiquitous\"\n        const highlightedContent = highlightWord(originalText, 'ubiquitous');\n        \n        // Update the content with the highlighted text\n        contentElement.innerHTML = highlightedContent;\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Regular Expression**: The `\\\\b` in the regular expression `\\\\b${word}\\\\b` ensures that only whole words are matched (e.g., it won't match \"ubiquitously\").\n- **`replace` method**: This method is used to replace each instance of \"ubiquitous\" with `<span class=\"highlight\">ubiquitous</span>`, which applies the yellow background color.\n- **Case Insensitivity**: The `i` flag in the regular expression makes the search case-insensitive, so it will match \"Ubiquitous\" as well as \"ubiquitous\".\n\nYou can run this code in an HTML file, and it will highlight all occurrences of the word \"ubiquitous\" with a yellow background."
