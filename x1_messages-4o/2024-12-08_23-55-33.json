        "content": "Creating a webpage that calculates the distance between the user's location and the nearest Italian restaurant using JavaScript involves several steps. You'll need to use the Geolocation API to get the user's current location, a database or an API to retrieve restaurant data, and an algorithm to calculate the distance and consider factors such as cuisine type, user preferences, and restaurant popularity.\n\nHere's a high-level approach and an example HTML page to get you started:\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach\n\n1. **Get User's Location**: Use the Geolocation API to determine the user's current position.\n\n2. **Fetch Restaurant Data**: Retrieve data of Italian restaurants from a reliable source. This can be done using an API like Google Places API or a custom database.\n\n3. **Filter Restaurants**: Filter the restaurant data based on user preferences (e.g., preferred cuisine, restaurant popularity).\n\n4. **Calculate Distance**: Use the Haversine formula or other algorithms to calculate the distance between the user's location and each restaurant.\n\n5. **Rank Restaurants**: Consider user preferences and restaurant popularity to rank the restaurants.\n\n6. **Display Results**: Show the nearest restaurant with details like distance, cuisine type, and popularity.\n\n### Example HTML Page\n\nHere's a basic example of how you might implement this in an HTML page:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Find Nearest Italian Restaurant</title>\n    <script>\n        // Function to get user's location\n        function getUserLocation() {\n            if (navigator.geolocation) {\n                navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(showPosition, showError);\n            } else {\n                alert(\"Geolocation is not supported by this browser.\");\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Function to handle successful location retrieval\n        function showPosition(position) {\n            const userLat = position.coords.latitude;\n            const userLon = position.coords.longitude;\n\n            // Fetch restaurant data from an API or database\n            fetch('your-restaurant-api-endpoint')\n                .then(response => response.json())\n                .then(data => findNearestRestaurant(userLat, userLon, data))\n                .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching restaurant data:', error));\n        }\n\n        // Function to calculate distance and find the nearest restaurant\n        function findNearestRestaurant(userLat, userLon, restaurants) {\n            let nearestRestaurant = null;\n            let minDistance = Infinity;\n\n            restaurants.forEach(restaurant => {\n                const distance = calculateDistance(userLat, userLon, restaurant.latitude, restaurant.longitude);\n                \n                // Incorporate user preferences and restaurant popularity\n                if (restaurant.type === 'Italian' && restaurant.popularity > 50) {\n                    if (distance < minDistance) {\n                        minDistance = distance;\n                        nearestRestaurant = restaurant;\n                    }\n                }\n            });\n\n            if (nearestRestaurant) {\n                displayRestaurant(nearestRestaurant, minDistance);\n            } else {\n                alert(\"No Italian restaurants found nearby.\");\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Haversine formula to calculate distance\n        function calculateDistance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2) {\n            const R = 6371; // Radius of the earth in km\n            const dLat = (lat2 - lat1) * Math.PI / 180;\n            const dLon = (lon2 - lon1) * Math.PI / 180;\n            const a =\n                0.5 - Math.cos(dLat) / 2 +\n                Math.cos(lat1 * Math.PI / 180) * Math.cos(lat2 * Math.PI / 180) * (1 - Math.cos(dLon)) / 2;\n\n            return R * 2 * Math.asin(Math.sqrt(a));\n        }\n\n        // Function to display the nearest restaurant\n        function displayRestaurant(restaurant, distance) {\n            document.getElementById('restaurant-info').innerHTML = `\n                <h2>Nearest Italian Restaurant</h2>\n                <p>Name: ${restaurant.name}</p>\n                <p>Distance: ${distance.toFixed(2)} km</p>\n                <p>Popularity: ${restaurant.popularity}</p>\n                <p>Address: ${restaurant.address}</p>\n            `;\n        }\n\n        // Function to handle geolocation errors\n        function showError(error) {\n            switch (error.code) {\n                case error.PERMISSION_DENIED:\n                    alert(\"User denied the request for Geolocation.\");\n                    break;\n                case error.POSITION_UNAVAILABLE:\n                    alert(\"Location information is unavailable.\");\n                    break;\n                case error.TIMEOUT:\n                    alert(\"The request to get user location timed out.\");\n                    break;\n                case error.UNKNOWN_ERROR:\n                    alert(\"An unknown error occurred.\");\n                    break;\n            }\n        }\n    </script>\n</head>\n<body onload=\"getUserLocation()\">\n    <div id=\"restaurant-info\">\n        <!-- Nearest restaurant details will be displayed here -->\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n- Replace `'your-restaurant-api-endpoint'` with the actual API endpoint or database query to fetch restaurant data.\n- The code assumes you have a list of restaurants with properties like `latitude`, `longitude`, `type`, `popularity`, `name`, and `address`.\n- You can enhance the logic to include more sophisticated filtering and ranking based on additional user preferences or restaurant features.\n- Consider adding error handling and user feedback for a better user experience.\n\nThis example is a starting point and can be expanded based on your specific requirements and available data sources."
