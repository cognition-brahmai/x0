However, I can offer a general understanding of how cancer treatments typically work.\n\nCancer treatments like those targeting specific pathways often aim to interrupt processes essential for cancer cell survival and proliferation. For example, some treatments target specific proteins or enzymes that are overactive in cancer cells, thereby inhibiting the growth of tumors.\n\nIf ABC-123 is a novel treatment, it might be designed to target a specific molecular pathway that is commonly mutated or overexpressed in certain types of cancer. This could involve inhibiting a signaling pathway that promotes tumor growth or survival, such as the MAPK/ERK pathway, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, or others.\n\nRegarding the specific types of cancer, treatments are often initially tested against cancers where the targeted pathway is known to play a critical role. For instance, if ABC-123 targets a pathway commonly altered in breast cancer or lung cancer, it may show effectiveness in those types.\n\nFor detailed, up-to-date information, you would typically look at the latest clinical trial results or published research papers in medical journals."
