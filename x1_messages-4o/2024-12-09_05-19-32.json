My arrays are not very large, typically less than 1E5 elements, but the operation is performed several millions of times. I'm currently using the numpy.count_nonzero function and then subtracting the result from the length of the array to get the count of zero elements. Is there a more efficient way to do this? Here's my current implementation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport timeit\n\narrs = []\nfor _ in range(1000):\n    arrs.append(np.random.randint(-5, 5, 10000))\n\ndef func1():\n    for arr in arrs:\n        zero_els = len(arr) - np.count_nonzero(arr)\n\nprint(timeit.timeit(func1, number=10))\n```"

        "content": "To count the number of zero elements in a NumPy array efficiently, you can use the `numpy.sum` function with a condition directly on the array. This approach can be more efficient because it leverages NumPy's ability to perform operations directly on arrays without the need for intermediate steps.\n\nHere's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport timeit\n\narrs = []\nfor _ in range(1000):\n    arrs.append(np.random.randint(-5, 5, 10000))\n\ndef func2():\n    for arr in arrs:\n        zero_els = np.sum(arr == 0)\n\nprint(timeit.timeit(func2, number=10))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- `arr == 0` creates a boolean array where each element is `True` if the condition is met (i.e., the element is zero) and `False` otherwise.\n- `np.sum(arr == 0)` then counts the number of `True` values, which corresponds to the number of zero elements in the array.\n\nThis method can be faster because it avoids computing both the non-zero count and the subsequent subtraction, thus minimizing overhead. However, with arrays of your size, both methods are quite efficient, and any improvements will be marginal. Still, using `np.sum` can be a cleaner and potentially faster approach, especially when the operation is repeated millions of times."
