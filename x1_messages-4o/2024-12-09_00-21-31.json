Currently, I compare the real paths of the desired and the existing symlinks, which is slow due to over NFS with automount. I am considering running a subprocess with the command 'ls -l' and working with the list of strings returned, but I prefer a better solution using a Python library. I have a symlink structure where 'link_name -> link_target' and 'link_target -> a_real_file'. I want to extract 'link_target' from 'link_name', irrespective of whether the real file exists or not. A correct symlink for me is a link that points to a predefined path, even if it does not exist. So, I need to check:\n\nlink_name_1 -> target_1\nlink_name_2 -> target_2\n\nHow can I extract the target path using Python?"

        "content": "To extract the target path of a symlink in Python, you can use the `os` and `os.path` modules, which provide a straightforward way to work with symlinks without resorting to subprocess calls. Specifically, you can use `os.readlink()` to read the target of a symlink. This approach is efficient and avoids the overhead of running shell commands or working with string outputs from subprocesses.\n\nHere's a simple function that demonstrates how to check the symlink target:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef check_symlink(link_name, expected_target):\n    try:\n        # Get the target path of the symlink\n        actual_target = os.readlink(link_name)\n        \n        # Compare the actual target with the expected target\n        if actual_target == expected_target:\n            print(f\"{link_name} correctly points to {expected_target}\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"{link_name} points to {actual_target} but expected {expected_target}\")\n            # Optional: recreate the symlink if it's incorrect\n            # os.remove(link_name)\n            # os.symlink(expected_target, link_name)\n    except OSError as e:\n        print(f\"Error reading symlink {link_name}: {e}\")\n\n# Example usage\ncheck_symlink('link_name_1', 'target_1')\ncheck_symlink('link_name_2', 'target_2')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`os.readlink(link_name)`**: This function reads the target of the symlink specified by `link_name`. It returns the path that the symlink points to, which is what you want to compare.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: The function is wrapped in a `try-except` block to handle potential `OSError` exceptions. This is useful if the `link_name` doesn't exist or isn't a symlink.\n\n3. **Comparison**: The function compares the actual target of the symlink with the expected target and prints the result. You can also modify the function to automatically recreate incorrect symlinks by using `os.remove()` and `os.symlink()`.\n\nThis method allows you to efficiently check and manage symlinks using Python's built-in capabilities, which should be much faster than using subprocesses, especially over NFS with automount."
