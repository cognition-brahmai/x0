Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nA = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nB = [2, 5]\n\n# A - B: Elements in A but not in B\ndifference_A_B = [item for item in A if item not in B]\n\n# B - A: Elements in B but not in A\ndifference_B_A = [item for item in B if item not in A]\n\nprint(\"A - B:\", difference_A_B)\nprint(\"B - A:\", difference_B_A)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, you will get the following output:\n\n```\nA - B: [1, 3, 4]\nB - A: [5]\n```\n\nThis approach uses list comprehensions to iterate over each list and checks for elements that are not in the other list, effectively computing the difference between the two lists."
