I also verified this and the same error persists. Can anyone help me understand what I'm doing wrong?"

Here's how you can correctly use `urllib` in Python 3.3 to open a URL:\n\nIn Python 3, `urllib` has been split into several modules, and `urlopen` is now available in the `urllib.request` module. Here is the correct way to use it:\n\n```python\nimport urllib.request\n\n# Open the URL\ntempfile = urllib.request.urlopen(\"http://yahoo.com\")\n\n# Read the response\ncontent = tempfile.read()\n\n# Print the content\nprint(content)\n```\n\nMake sure you are using `import urllib.request` instead of just `import urllib`. This should resolve the `AttributeError` you are encountering. If you continue to face issues, ensure that your Python environment is correctly set up and that there are no conflicting module names in your project."
