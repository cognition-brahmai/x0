        "content": "To find the lowest prime number that evenly divides into 147, we need to perform prime factorization.\n\nFirst, let's check the divisibility of 147 by the smallest prime numbers:\n\n1. **Divisibility by 2**: 147 is an odd number, so it's not divisible by 2.\n2. **Divisibility by 3**: Add the digits of 147 (1 + 4 + 7 = 12). Since 12 is divisible by 3, 147 is also divisible by 3.\n\nNow, divide 147 by 3:\n\n\\[ 147 \\div 3 = 49 \\]\n\nThis means 3 is a factor of 147. Now, we need to express 3 as a Roman numeral. The Roman numeral for 3 is **III**.\n\nSo, the lowest prime number that evenly divides 147 is 3, and it is expressed as **III** in Roman numerals."
